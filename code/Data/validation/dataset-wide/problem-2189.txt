I'm a relatively-junior dev being out of university for 2.5 years. I've been working at a start-up game dev company and it's not working out. I just don't fit in at all. You can see my other posts to read about this. Here is what I'm looking for: 

I feel very distanced from my colleagues. I'm not sure if it's just this company or all software places so I am seeking your opinion. Also, I think it gets in the way of productivity because no one wants to mentor or share knowledge and that's not really my style. I like sharing knowledge. I work as a game programmer at a small company. When I first started it was just 4 very senior guys in a room and they did not talk to each other or eat lunch together. They set the tone for a silent and disconnected atmosphere. I can understand as they were working on separate projects. I was just out of university and started as a tester. They also gave me an old legacy game to convert and I had no clue what I was doing as I had never made a game before in my life and they were very very rude to me about my 'newbie' questions. That created even more distance than there already was because the manager hired me because there was room to grow into the role. The fact that I'm female doesn't help either. As time went on nothing really changed. I got married and didn't tell them - why would I don't think they would care. I also got pregnant and didn't tell them because a) was afraid of discrimination b) I didn't think they would care (a bunch of young unmarried guys). Also, they can be very judgmental. When I did share some of my personal life like I haven't traveled much in my life they looked down on me. The company grew and they took on more people. When I came back from mat leave they hired even more people but the culture didn't change. The new project manager said some border-lining sexist comments to me about why I'm not home with the baby. He appears to be small-minded and power-hungry. Because of this I am closed off even more to the point where I avoid taking lunch at the same time as anyone else and try my best to avoid any non-work conversation topics at all costs. I'm a very shy, quiet, geeky girl who finds any non-standard/'politically-correct' dialog or confrontation in a work environment to be extremely inappropriate. Is it normal for colleagues to be so closed off from each other? Is a non-game software environment any different? I don't think this place will ever change so what are some things to ask in the next job interview? 

Be soft on the person, but hard on the issue. It's always a good idea to treat him as kindly as you would treat somebody you don't know at all. And it seems you are not so familiar with him to call him a friend, so there seems no place for complete honesty. So confirming to him that you trust in your team that his concern will not get swept under the rug seems like a good idea. Avoid any impression that you will take care of the matter personally, beyond checking that his ticket will be scheduled correctly. If you offer any priviledges, you might raise in him the suspicion that other people get elevated privileges too, which eventually could escalate the situation. After all, let's not forget that this is all well on the way towards a corrupt transaction. Maybe he's trying to trade personal relations or even coercion in exchange with privileges. People may try that because they don't understand that resources are limited. However they will usually understand pretty quickly when their own effort is futile and costs them more than they expect as a return. By staying friendly and professional you can also avoid any sign of you having figured out their unfair game, and keeps them from scheming intrigues, which people of that kind will sometimes do in response to disappointment. 

If however you just want to be left alone, don't write anything about it in your CV. You wouldn't write about your sexual preferences in a CV either, although you have every right to stay yourself, right? Nobody wants to hear that because the necessity to build teams for working on complex tasks is ubiquitous and what would stay in the memory of the responsible HR person is: "Oh, it's difficult to integrate him into a team, so we would have to find him a task where he can work alone, but we don't have any, so..." On the other hand if you just want to find a job where you are most welcome for being able to work alone (like a one-man outpost on Mars for example), then frankly tell everybody about it. But then you have to be prepared for getting a high rate of refusals. Psychologically this is a serious thing, not many people can suffer. 

Recently I worked at a job and believe I should report my former manager to human resources. His attitude and demeanor was very rude/hostile/aggressive/abrasive, both when speaking about work and non-work related topics. Any one of the things he did wouldn't be enough for me to inform HR, but the fact that he acted like this several times a day each day is what has me concerned. He would call me unprofessional, immature or a liar, and I did not understand where this was coming from. For example when I said I was reading up on a technology that I hadn't used before he said I had lied on my application form, but I never did say I knew it. A non-work related example was he asked if I had been to a parade over the weekend and I said no and he said I must not have any friends. This did impact my ability to do work because when I needed to ask a question he would brush me off and act rude. Many times I tried to resolve these issues and asked him to speak to me differently. After this didn't work I brought in his manager, yet it still didn't help. In fact, he forbid me to speak to anyone else unless it was about something personal (i.e. not work related). Other people in the building had problems with him too, but none had to work with him like I did. Not sure if I should mention it, but he tried to coerce me to come back and work for free a couple days. Something similar happened to me once before and I regretted not reporting the person to HR and have decided it would be the right thing to do for this. My question is, how do I report it to HR and what should I have ready? I wrote down the contact info of a few HR reps. Should I first phone or email? A lot of what the way he acted isn't captured in his words. I can't quote his tone of voice and body language, which were very aggressive. How can I convey this? I don't know why he acted this way and I don't think he realized he was doing it. I'm not sure if it's a cultural, or a mental illness or just how he thinks a manager is supposed to act. To be clear, I don't hold vice against him, though I don't think he needs more training if he's going to continue to be a manager and other people shouldn't have to deal with this. UPDATE: while I appreciate the answers given, this is not up to debate. I'm not looking for why people think doing nothing is better, I'm looking for answers how the best way to proceed with contacting HR is.
