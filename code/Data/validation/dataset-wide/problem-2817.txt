Philosophically I do not think there is any direct attempt to discuss it before Lyotard in 1979. Not too many other strict philosophers occupied themselves with this concept, and Lyotard did so only as part of a commission from the Conseil des universités du Québec. Obviously in the field of literature it's sooner, as one sees there a more immediate attempt to represent the type of reality emerging globally in the 1960s. Ihab Hassan's book on Postmodern Literature was written in 1971. I do not believe the concept became a solid piece of American thought until Frederic Jameson's publication of "Postmodernism, or, the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism" in 1984. Many of the authors that have discussed do not have any consistency with their periodization or the rationalizing of their dates. Of those that look to political and economic events, there's often disprepancies in how they tie the event to the resultant changes in thought, modes of representation, modes of politicization, shifts in how genre's should be represented etc etc. 

Each of these things represent on occurence at a "site", where a site is defined in the following manner : 

As related to the buddhism part of your question, self-delusion is always a risk in any system of practice. And with awareness of these risks Siddhartha Guatama instituted two epistemological checks built in the framework of his thinking. One designed for external sources and the other the types of delusion that arises within us because of our own minds. 

1) Nonsense: Say there are two laws, one which states that the first level of denotation is a member of a higher order type or a class, than the objects which are in or referenced by it. The second says that an element must belong to a distinct set, and cannot belong to the subsets of that set. When these laws are broken you create paradoxes and nonsense. Sense thus presupposes nonsense as types of expression for which rules against infinite regression and disjuctive syntheses are based, as they can kill sense. When the description of the two series of "word = x", "thing = x" explains the functioning of denotation, manifestation and signification, it's eliding the explicit description of the rules that prevent sense from not being created. This chapter is an explanation of that which is later explored explicitly with the chapter on paradoxes, but in the form of the raw material of expression that doesn't follow the rules that produce sense. In a way these are multiple presentations of the same process, just from different angles. The ultimate point here is to uncover the process by which sense is produced, and to explore in what sense sense operates on the surface of things. 2) The phantasm is a bit more difficult to explain in simple terms but I'll try.. Try to recall the first time you were to exposed to sexuality --something that left a clear mark on your development psychologically. That scene as emotionally experienced by a subject leaves some latent as well as explicit mark on ones psyche would be considered an example of a phantasm.. Something that lingers, that operates on multiples levels of your mind (conscious and unconscious). Another example might be some early experience where you're acting out some type of aggression or urge for freedom from ones parents and you're marked by an originary experience of fighting or doing something risky that leaves resonates intensively inside your body, and marks your psyche without being the slightest bit conscious of it... and that comes to signal at some unconscious way who you end up becoming. That originary marking is the meeting of your biology with individual expression of culture (human psycho-social creation). Those are phantasms. You continually create/repeat. You are caught up in them. These are essential to understanding the messy depths of the latter half of the Logic of Sense but you've already passed the chapters on language, orality, sexuality, you're in the heart of the pathic as the bodily conditions for the arrival of thought. 

To your sub-question regarding iterations of communism, one needs to first ground it but understanding and articulating what is the meaning of a political concept. Is a concept a thing? Or is it designed to express the "essence" or necessary criteria of something? This is why I prefer bare concepts. You strip ones mental representations of what is contingent and unnecessary from it. If a US politician called some modest reform of capitalist exploitation "communism" but it does nothing to change or even alter the extent of exclusivizable privilege, you can say with relative certainty that although the name is used for purposes of epithet, it is not conceptually (factually) accurate to say it is communism. The same with a State that may have x y z as potential goals or slogans. Does something make an earnest attempt at or achieve something that undoes capitalist exploitation (as exercized by either capitalist or State)? If not, one should seek a more accurate, perhaps more nuanced description of it (e.g. Soviet State Capitalism). If I were the first person to create a TV, and the TV kinda sucked, it had a lot of static, it's black and white, it's too big and clunky and complicated and expensive, it can be a TV, still have a shitload of problems, but I wouldn't even be aware of just what one could do with that idea 50 in the future. This is very basic and uncontroversial a statement in any area of discussion, with the exception of things that have the potential to disturb relations of established power. This is why despite being a planet of 7-8 billion people with tons of brilliant minds, we passively "buy-in" to this idea that there's only one form of economic relations of production that can work and more than that, we admonish people for even thinking about fixing the sources of the problem and global capitalist watchdogs like the US actually physically attack, subvert, and even promote coups in nations that want to exist outside of the sphere of neo-liberal capitalism. 

To take a different approach to answering your question, to give a contextualization to the distinction in concept between theology and philosophy, consider that the origins of philosophy and the aspects of religion that concern truth (explanation of worldly events via the action of divine entities) have quite specific divergences in thought and practice that distinguished the two movements very early on. Between Epimenides and Parmenides there's a change in context of discussions of truth and agency that show why epistemology and metaphysics are co-posited simultaneously and are at once distinct from religious narrativization. In a great study called Les origines de la pensée grecque by Jean-Pierre Vernant and another great later book by Marcel Detienne called Les Maîtres de vérité dans la Grèce archaïque a picture is painted of the material and social conditions of life that create for the first time in the world a concern for Aletheia under this peculiar condition of frameworks (rules) of thought instead of being tied to the utterer as it was even still at philosophy's beginnings with religio-mythical thought. What distinguished the poet and muse's truth from Parmenides's was the strict call for non-contradiction. The theogonies and magicoreligious discourse on the other hand were tied to worldly power of Kings, Priests, Seers and the Muses whose mnemonics of verse encapsulated the "truth" of historical or present reigns and desired social order essentially. In Hesiod e.g., it is literally the Muses who have the priviledge of "speaking the truth" (alethea gerusasthai). One could say that even today, theological discourse plays a similar function of establishing a priviledge with particular utterers appointed to "speak truth" on behalf of the divine which is not the place of man to question really or interfere. But in this subtle movement away from religious discourse the very idea of truth becomes transformed from being associated with two diads --Aletheia/Lethe and Aletheia and Dike-- so the social function of preserving truth in memory or letting it slide into oblivion on the one hand and the function of truth being equivalent to divine justice on the other-- to be instead secularized from the necessity for paregoros and paraiphasis as a field of persuation, which became institutional necessities after the Hoplite Reform (of which there are many great histories written). It had the consequence of unseating magicoreligious discourse at the sole arbiter of aletheia. Truth becomes something needed to be managed es meson --from the center or by the community. Thus spawning the rise of sophists, rhetoricians, philosophers etc and their combat for prominence. When truth becomes a "common" concern you need rules, consistency and eventually an objectivity separate from the person that speaks it. Thales's metaphysics is not related to a cosmogony but rather to a type of geometric attempt at deductive reasoning. Parmenides's is equally secular in relation to his Greek peers. So this is a longwinded way of saying that they don't really any parent-child type of relationship to each other. Socio-political conditions created philosophy as facilitated by concrete events in history.
