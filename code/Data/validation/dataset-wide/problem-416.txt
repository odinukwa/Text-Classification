The world has no inherent magic. A link to the correct plane to draw mana into this one requires a certain capacity. Spending that mana to do magic also requires a certain capacity that is smaller. Faeries have a small enough capacity that they can't ever renew the world's mana. Faeries know this and so are generally not first to start a fight, human wizards know this and accordingly start fights only when grouped together or when fighting a single faerie, etc. 

While the other answers point toward higher frequency radiation (and I agree with them) its interesting to note that Rayleigh scattering and other effects seem to point to the solution being opposite in an atmosphere, especially with particulates, due to bloom. Which, if I'm correct on that, has interesting implications in the event of planetary invasion as you probably would have sides with different colors. The atmosphere based troops would have redder while the space one's would have bluer to take advantage of their own tactical position. 

...and a few months assembling the created parts; It still seems pretty reasonable to accomplish within a year given perfect knowledge, the right raw materials, and a decent set of able-bodies. 

You sure drew the short end of the stick. Your selling point was your walls, but if they can be flown over and your city bombed... It's pretty hard to beat future-sight as well. I suppose when you sick a chimera the size of the Kremlin on a city it doesn't matter if you saw it coming. Unfortunately your side doesn't have anything that can eat tanks for breakfast. You had the right idea with going for aeroplanes, the sky is the only real way you can catch up. At the very least you could then fire your anti-tank rounds from on high. Maybe then gravity could make up the difference in penetration for the chimeras. First and foremost though, I would send spies to the Scholars and see if you can determine the extent of their sight. After you've determined the extent of their powers I would have the spies fly back to your capitol to hasten advancements with their captured tech. You could also start collecting Magnesium. If you can scrounge enough up you can forge a pipe with holes in it, after being set on fire it would burn through most anything. But do be careful! Titanium can be set on fire quite easily by burning Magnesium, and is very hard to put out! 

People have pretty much hit on the basic problem with your question already and provided some workarounds. Your problem is you usually need competition to be a game. But for each challenge you can tweak it so that chances for inter-personal conflict are reduced. Your challenge types are: 

It would be nice to have biomass on a planet before you got there. As well as any target byproducts you might engineer them to make. I'd add that Deinococcus radiodurans can survive anywhere you can't engineer other bacteria to. So you're pretty much guaranteed to be able to just launch a can across the universe at any planet, even if you can't quite fly to it yet. If your lucky the locals may have evolved before you got there and be able to contribute to science with their "un-poisoned" paradigms. (Panspermia anyone?) 

Having gone to school in the Pacific Northwest, with a teacher who very much loved rocks, this was actually something we covered in class with documentaries, etc. What are the largest geographical implications? Yellowstone would flood a very large area in lava rather quickly creating some lovely plains. The earthquake would probably trigger our San Adreas fault which would set off pretty much every fault in California as well as causing the Juan de Fuca Plate to subduct. The resulting quake would have three major effects and possibly a fourth. The first would be that it would probably set off volcanoes in the Ring of Fire (not immediately but as seen on a time lapse of recorded volcanic eruptions would look pretty instantaneous). The second would be the strength of the earthquake makes it behave completely differently than normal and "earthquake-proof" structures would receive much more extensive damage than regular wooden houses, large towers would be gone. The strong quake would induce liquefaction in extensive areas west of the Rocky Mountains so places like Puyallup would disappear underground and events like the Oso mudslide would happen in many areas. Third, the tsunami generated would be massive and at least 80 ft high, probably much higher. The tsunami would come after the earthquake so the structural damage would probably allow the tsunami to collapse any remaining structures. You have typical flooding problems and slightly more drastic tsunami ones around the entire Pacific. The fourth is it could trigger Rainer which would be much worse. Also Mt. St. Helens if its re-pressurized enough and the eruption of Rainier doesn't effect it. If it did trigger it would be quicker than the Ring of Fire. Any hope of anyone surviving west of the Rocky Mountains probably just completely disappeared. Ash levels would significantly increase especially in our bread-basket states. Would humanity would survive such an event? At least some of humanity would survive pretty much anything that could be dished out from such an event, especially around the Atlantic. The different regions would be affected separately and at different times and we know enough to be able to have at least a small group dodge most of it. Extent of damage to nature both in the ash-covered areas and the surrounding landscape? How long would/could it take for the winter to lapse? I don't remember enough about the expected ash levels to say. It definitely would release a decent amount of particulates into the air, but going off any other high-ash events I could think of we'd be fine (the world won't turn into Pompeii and it would certainly effect temperature but I don't think we'd get too cold). Does it get worse? You didn't ask about non-geographical but its probably worth mentioning that a large part of the global economy is centered around the Pacific, that the US provides a lot of the foreign aid in terms of disaster relief, and that we would have a large drop in US food production. You would probably see the worst global depression unless the death-toll offset the gross losses in production, neither being a great scenario. Also you should probably count the number of nuclear reactors and radioactive dump sites around the Pacific Rim and add them all to the "apocalypse-level" around the Pacific. Note: The chain reaction is an extremely likely scenario if Rainier were to go off first. Please note that the chances are lower for the chain if other things go off first. The lowest chances probably occur with Yellowstone erupting first, but its still a possible scenario.
