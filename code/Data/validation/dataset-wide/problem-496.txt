I am looking for a bag to attach to my road bike that I can attach quickly without having a rack on my bike. I saw one a few weeks ago (on someones bike) that attached to the seat post and extended backwards. It mounted on the seat post with a screw-on clamp but the bag (and 95% of the weight associated with the bag) could be removed via a clip. I don't need anything very large. The bag I saw was just big enough for a t-shirt or your lunch. I am interested in finding the bag described above or another bag. Here are my requirements: 

Purchasing a new fork is shockingly expensive. I'd say something like 25-75% of the bikes retail price. So if you need to change anything else and the fork you should get a new bike (and maybe a rigid fork to turn this into a sweet commuter). 

Paired with a t-shirt this can make any sized bandage. The other plus is that they are also useful for bike repairs. Here is the trick to keep the tape small: 

You could easily do this your self but you'll likely end up with a rivet gun and a box of 100 rivets you'll never use again (on a bike at least). Whatever method you chose, I'd suggest completing it before any of the rest of your bike build (I'm guessing from the missing front end that you're rebuilding this bike). If you can't get it fixed you might have to scrap (or at least rethink) the project and you don't want to waste any money on other parts until you know for sure. Regarding welding: Aside from the heat issue of welding aluminum, you'll also have a tough (impossible?) time finding someone who can weld a steel boss onto an aluminum frame. Or you'll have an impossible task of finding an aluminum boss to use instead. Think about it.. there's a reason the manufacture glued the boss on in the first place. ** Be extra careful if you are repairing a brake boss. It holds more force and obviously has more dire consequences if it breaks off again. 

I'll add that anything hand tight will come loose fairly soon. As the knurled race loosens it will start to damage itself an/or the ball bearings and cause sloppy handling and steering. I'm not saying that you want to torque the race down to the fork, but up against the lock nut as @alex suggests: 

I am not interested in whether it is a good idea to ride a road bike down a muddy bumpy trail. What I am asking is will I hurt my bike? Even though my bike was second hand and cost me less than $100 I have a strong relationship with it. Recognizing Problems: I know that I may damage my wheels doing more agressive riding. It is pretty easy to eye-ball wheels to see if they are ridable. Is this true for the frame as well? If I do structural damage to the frame would it be obvious? Cross: I think that cyclocross bikes are designed for the kind of riding that I am describing. Is there any difference between my retro road bike and a cyclocross bike? Question: How cautious do I need to be to avoid damaging my road bike? 

What difference will more expensive tires make? What width of tires will work best for the conditions described? What price range is reasonable for a good set of XC tires? Any other pieces of wisdom I should consider when choosing tires? Any examples of good tires for these conditions. 

Is it easy to sand blast just the Al part? If the carbon fiber gets sand blasted it will just get destroyed, right? What would happen if I used glass bead or plastic bead blasting? It should be no problem for a professional to repaint the Al. Simply mask off the carbon fiber and paint away, right? 

Huffy isn't one of those bike companies that has a "nice" well-organized** history, especially in light of its more-recent history: $URL$ So if it is a Huffy, no one at the company will likely be able to confirm it. Additionally, these weren't very (at all?) sought-after bikes so there won't be a user-group maintaining a serial number database (like some high-end brands). ** meaning not bought/sold/rebranded/in-name-only 

It looks like that Park tool is specifically designed for use on PF30 BB's (+1 for using the right tool). Just curious though, how do the bushings line up with the BB? What surface do they push against? If they push against the inner race, you may well have damaged the bearing. If they push against the outer race or the bearing cup you should be fine. The bearing (i.e. internal race) isn't designed for purely lateral loading. Are you certain that it didn't have any stiff spots before installation? You can try popping it out and free spinning it in your hand. If its still stiff outside the frame its certainly damaged. Even if you pressed the bearing cup in completely bass-akwards it shouldn't bind the bearing. The outer race and cup are thick enough that it would take serious damage/force to deform the outer shape of the bearing to cause any noticeable friction. To address one of the comments: If this is new it shouldn't have any stiff spots. Even the cheapest bearing should spin smoothly out of the box. Putting the crank on will change the inertia of the system and only make it harder to detect these spots. 

I always like a wool hat. I ride with a helmet but if it gets cool at night a hat really helps to keep you warm and cozy. 

I brought the jacket home and began having second thoughts. I am thinking about returning it and continuing my search. Here are my requirements: 

I recently decided that I wanted to get into road biking. Last summer I dropped $20 on the shittiest road bike you can imagine. I used the bike for about two months (I could never unseize the seat post). I shopped for bike #2 for a couple months. I knew where I would be riding and what features I wanted from bike #1. The Norco I bought (Bike #2) was also a used bike but it is awesome. The fit is perfect (learned from bike #1). It is reasonably light weight, has better components and not a spot of rust. After making some repairs on bike #1 I am confident making the same repairs on a bike I love. I also have all the parts from bike #1 in my basement ready to sub in should something break or help out my friends when they need some parts. I know now that I love the road. I am thinking about turning the Norco into a commuter and investing in a newer lighter road bike. After I get bike #3 I will begin evaluating it and planning for bike #4. Key points: 

Since you have a relatively "flat" spot there (at least flat in the longitudinal direction) you have two options: 

Once's it's dried be sure to test it by attaching whatever brake/derailleur the boss is for(in your case the rear derailleur) and running cable through it. You need to be sure that the epoxy will hold the forces that will actually be applied by the brake/derailleur** Don't expect your results to look pretty though. 

I'm not 100% certain how the DT Swiss centerlock works but it seems like its a way to attach a 6 bolt brake rotor to their hub. What may have happened is that since your center lock was lose: 

About mole grips or locking pliers for us in the US ($URL$ I've never found a pair that were large enough to do this. Also, you lose the hand feedback that regular pliers give you. You won't know when the race is about to slip until its too late. 

I did this on a recent Al frame with the exact same problem. I bought a metal (steel) cable boss from the local bike builder and epoxied it myself. I used Loctite's Metal/Concrete epoxy since it's designed for: machinery, appliances, tools, lawnmowers, automotive components, pipes, embedding bolts and screws into metals, concrete or stone and sealing electrical components against moisture and vibration Although lots of other epoxies will probably work. If you do this be sure to read the instructions on the epoxy, clean the surfaces on both parts, and create a good clamp for the piece. It'll take 24 hours to dry fully and you aren't going to achieve good results by holding it with your hands. 

@Carel's answer to this question is perfectly acceptable, but I wanted provide another alternative. When cornering and doing any kind of bike manoeuvring, you should be in the attack position. The attack position allows you to shift your weight around on the bike and has the added bonus of keeping your pedals flat ensuring you don't have a pedal strike. More info from MTB Techniques: 

I am looking for a cycling jacket for fall/spring. Depending on how well it works I may use it through (part of) winter as well. I did a bit of shopping last night and purchased this MEC SuperMicroft Cycling Jacket. 

One thing that may be more dangerous on a fixie is performing emergency turns. Since the pedals are always turning you need to make sure that your crank doesn't strike the ground while cornering. Other than this I wouldn't think riding a fixie would be any more dangerous. 

Edit: The Compatibility Map 2016 MTB Components is here. Still trying to figure out how to read it... 

What is the best place to buy bike components that will ship to Canada? I would prefer a Canadian company or someone who ships within Canada to avoid large shipping costs and inport duty. I am especially interested in buying used components. Right now I am interested in buying: 

But these require that the axle already be removed. So what is the proper way to remove these bearings? I know that I can just tap the axle out with a rubber mallet and force one of the bearings out, but I think this would damage the bearing. 

I realize this will be different for all headsets, but: I have a Tange Levin headset. The headset is starting to show wear: the fork sticks at regular intervals through its turning. I've inspected the races and they don't show any visible sign of deformation. Is it possible that only the ball bearings have deformed and that the races are fine? Is it worthwhile to order replacement bearings and reassembling the bike? Has anybody had success doing this? 

Seems like you have two options. I'm not sure this is your exact model but the broken piece should just unscrew. 

Disc brake hubs are dished almost equally left/right. You will want to make sure your road/touring rim is not an asymmetric rim, designed for dishing on one side and not the other. This Ritchey Girder is an example: 

I have been running disks on my summer bike and rims on the winter bike for the last two years. Here is why: Any bike ridden in the winter will be destroyed by salt in 2 seasons. (On my second winter bike right now). Without question disk brakes will probably work better however I have had good luck with rim brakes, specificity with vbrakes. In my opinion the best bet is to use rim brakes and (with all the money you will save) get a good set of tires, fenders, clear downhill goggles and something sweet for the summer bike. 

Question Are there any good quality bike computers for a reasonable price? Here are my requirements: 

Note: All pictures are take from google images. Background I have a short commute through part of Ottawa and run lots of erands on my bike. When it is snowing and when the roads don't look good I have several routes that are only slow residential streets so I can stay away from people yacking on their phones. I would also like to start doing some winter trail riding. Here is the historical weather data for Ottawa. 

it allowed the rotor to work against the 6 posts on the adapter causing some wear it allowed the adapter to work against the hub, also causing some wear. 

Unscrew what's left and epoxy it together apart from the internal workings. Buy a replacement cover. I couldn't find any online shops selling replacement covers, but a call to Shimano* will probably net you the exact piece you need. You'll need to know the model number which should be displayed somewhere and look like SL-xxxx. I can't imagine a new one will be more than $20. 

From experience, (being an amateur seeing pros at events) a lot of people use Speedplays for better pedal clearance. You can also do something slick like this to create a clip/cleat combination. 

I am trying to learn the right way to remove bearings from a track hub. The bearings are cartridge bearings pressed into the hub. The axle has a ridge that prevents it from being removed while both bearings are in place. 

I've dented the rim on my Shimano WH-RS-10 rear wheel. I found the tech doc pdf. I've had wheels rebuilt before but always with rims that were available to consumers. I can't find any place that sells the Shimano rim, nipples, or spokes to rebuild this wheel. I know I can get close matches from other companies, but I'm looking for identical components to match the good front wheel I have. Does Shimano actually provide these components for sale? Would this be something my LBS could order?
