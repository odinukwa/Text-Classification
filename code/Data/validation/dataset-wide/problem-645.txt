I'm going out on a limb and suspect you have removed the end nut and have pushed the valve core down into the tube to allow the sealant liquid room to move past and into the tube ? Short answer is, don't do that. Use tubes that have a removable valve core. These can be identified by two flats on opposite sides. 

And the cartridge BB is a standard looking 68mm english threadded unit, with an overall width of 122mm (probably for a triple front crank?) So if your bike frame takes a Press Fit BB30 then this will press into the frame fine. You will need a press tool to get it installed right though. Whether the resulting chainline matches whatever your bike needs, that's another question. Also, your cranks and chainrings will need to have a conventional square taper mounting. If you have anything else, this won't work and you'd need to replace the cranks as well. The cranks listed in your comment will fit the square taper interface, but they're single chainring and I'd be surprised if 122mm is the correct width. If you still have the old BB axle, measure it for overall length. Use calipers if possible, millimetres count. 

Plus you'll want at least one big adjustable spanner/crescent, and rags/solvent(petrol) for cleaning, new ball bearings, suitable grease, and time and patience to repack the bearings. 

In the end I had success using a grinding wheel and a 100mm / 4" grinder to remove all the slightly loose chrome. The good chrome under the grips simply wouldn't move, so ended up being ground off by the grinder wheel. This left a terrible surface, with many small flattened patches and diagonal scoring. It was no longer round. I spent a half-hour with 80 grit sandpaper, then 160 grit then 400 grit paper. It was a slow process, and ultimately finished, it was no fun at all. Then I immediately primed the bare steel to prevent any further rust from developing on the virgin steel surface. On top of that I will put several coats of black spraypaint, and then a couple of clear topcoats. I didn't get a photo of it before painting, but here's one showing one coat of primer. Looks like its been peeled with a vegetable peeler, then zoom in to see the scratches in the "around" direction. 

EDIT I just did a 12 hour bike ride yesterday, and my pants were fine. The Petroleum Jelly did well, so no chaffing the whole way. My only problem came from sunburned ankles, because I forgot to put sunblock on down there and as I rode, the pant cuffs rode up and socks rode down exposing skin. 

One of the less-common situations where front wheel braking can be worse than rear wheel braking is when slowing with a loaded trailer. I have personally jack-knifed a bike when stopping for a red traffic light. The trailer was unbraked but had a decent load of tools, maybe 40 kilograms. The trailer continued to push forward, raising the rear wheel off the ground. Since the front wheel was stopped, the rear wheel was pushed to the right. I used my right foot on the ground and the right side of the saddle to hold the trailer, then straightened up by rolling forward 30cm. If in this situation I had braked more with the rear, the nose weight of the trailer would have pressed the rear wheel down and gained more traction, reducing the chance of a skid. However for all other riding the front brake is most of my stopping. The one exception would be ice riding - that is scary and I lack experience doing it. 

Do you mean Mt Ventoux in France, frequently part of the the TDF and classed as a real bastard of a climb? Looking at segments like $URL$ even the top riders struggle to get 14 km/h I'd be grinding away at 4 to 5 km/h. 

I got an unused 20" folding tyre that had sat in someone's bag for 10 years. It was seriously zig-zagged when unfolded, but once on the bike it was perfect. Later I suffered a puncture, and on changing the tube I noted the tyre still wanted to zigzag, but its completely unnoticeable on the rim. For peace of mind, you might want to lubricate the rim with water when first fitting, and then half-inflate the tube, and give the whole tyre a good visual inspection before fully inflating. You can also use your thumbs every inch or two around the outside, to push the tyre's sidewall sideways. Any oddness, stop and evaluate. Note that a "pop" is probably just be the bead seating, compared to a herniation where the tyre is bulging out. Leave the wheel fully inflated overnight before riding the first time, and check it again before your ride. 

If you've only done 100 km on it, its under warranty so take it back. Sealant may fix it for now, but a weld shouldn't leak air, so its a weak spot on the rim. 

You and I are in a similar place. I can do 150 km flat rides with no problem, but 1000 metres of elevation increase wears me out. So the longterm solution is to practice by doing more. I've set a climbing goal in strava of 50 km vertical for the calendar year 2017. As of Jan 15 I have done 3,435 metres, which is well on track, but its summer here. Technique helps - learning to gain momentum from any downhill or flat bit and then carry that momentum as far up the next slope as possible. Don't coast down grades. Pacing is a big thing too - working your body to a point that is not your maximum, so you can maintain a speed up the whole climb. No point going mad for the first quarter and then needing a rest stop. Equipment - climbing is hard work. I have an unfashionable road bike with a triple front, and a low gear that's below 1:1 (ie 26 teeth on the front and 28 on the rear cassette largest cog) Roadies look down on triples, but this is about YOUR performance, not theirs. Many MTBs had triple chainrings too, but 1x have become more popular lately. In short, you might benefit from adding bigger gears, so that you can increase your cadence while climbing. Mashing is not as efficient as spinning up a steep grade. This might mean changing your cassette for a larger one, or having a choice of rear wheels available. Weight - If you're lugging 2 bottles of water up, do you need them? Its hard to justify carrying stuff that you might need, but some things like pumps are non negotiable. Are you carrying too much food? On the same vein - your bike's weight. I changed from a 20 KG steel MTB to a 12 KG aluminium road bike and my segment times all dropped by 10% immediately. This image shows how much of your energy goes into different things as the slope increases. This one is aimed at MTB riders, road is worse.
