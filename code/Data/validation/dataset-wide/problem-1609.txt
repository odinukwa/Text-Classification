I am cynical about a report on Gizmodo that NASA is developing Warp Drive. This was trending on Google Plus tonight and gathering a bit of attention. $URL$ 

The BRAT diet is Bananas, Rice, Apples and Toast. Some sites like this first one add Yogurt. $URL$ In this wikiHow, the A is applesauce and the Bananas should be green: $URL$ Wikipedia has the applesauce but doesn't specify green bananas. $URL$ About has BRAT, also adds yogurt, chicken, and blueberries. $URL$ One site will say "Don't eat fiber." and yet the bananas are also explained as having fiber. Similar issues occur with sugars. So there doesn't seem to be a consistent approach. Is the BRAT diet backed by any kind of scientific studies or evidence or is it more of a folk remedy passed down by word of mouth? 

He also mentions the famous Einstein letter to President Roosevelt describing detonating an atomic bomb in a port: 

An online article in Lighthouse Digest on The Great Port Chicago Disaster and Mutiny mentions a large wave created by the blast: 

The Discovery article "Donner Party Ate Family Dog, Maybe Not People: Did ethnic prejudice spur the now infamous legend of the Donner Party's cannibalism?" by Viegas (2010) provides its own summary: 

Isn't a bit late for an examination of bones and garbage from around the camp? Did the Donner Party resort to cannibalism, or is that merely pernicious slander embellished to sell books and newspapers? 

Published in the Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, Milgram's article (paywall, abstract visible) also describes in the abstract similar psychological effects on subjects: 

Some people experience unease going through the airport, and it seems best to provide something soothing and uncontroversial to look at while walking to the aircraft .... like advertising. Certainly I wouldn't expect to see: A dead child in a casket holding their bible 

If there were danger, I would expect the American Heart Association or one of the other sources to announce it. So my final answer is: I could find no evidence of warnings about the dangers of cellphones to a healthy heart directed at the general public at the most likely authoritative source If you are asking for personal safety reasons, you should consider that: (1) the effect of a radio transmitter is proportional to 1/r^2, twice as far away is 1/4 the signal. (2) in your automobile, an exploding airbag hitting your chest pocket may break the phone up into sharp pieces that could hurt you.... (3) there have been reports and demonstrations (e.g. on youTube) that under some circumstances Li-Ion batteries can ignite... and most phones use Li-Ion batteries. However, there could be some warnings... like smoke and heat... and isn't common. If any of this really worries you, just put it in another pocket 

Yes, it happens. Here are some cases where a laptop was identified as the cause of a fire by officials: House burns down; laptop left on cardboard to recharge overheats, catches fire Laptop starts fire in dorm; 90 students displaced Laptop left charging on bed starts fire There's more. Search Google News for 'fire was caused by laptop computer' 

I guess I find it difficult to believe that all humans ever spoke the same language or even a small handful of languages, say 3-4. In the article, the evidence for this seems to be a theory that the sounds of local African languages are more complex because these languages have evolved more and are thus older. According to the article: 

An NBC News article from Sep 2007 suggests the results can vary depending on who is included in the college category: 

An article in Wired $URL$ notes that the estimated age of the rock had to be adjusted in light of new evidence. Why does it matter that the gas in the meteorite matches a modern Martian atmosphere if the rock was ejected from Mars in a cataclysm over a billion years ago? Would the atmosphere still be the same? Aren't there other solar system objects, such as comets, that contain gas whose composition we either haven't yet observed, or whose gas might otherwise mimic what scientists saw in the Mars probe observations? As a meteorite enters Earth's atmosphere, isn't it subject to thermal stresses that could produce or change gas bubbles? Since we now have rovers on Mars whose primary job is to examine rocks, shouldn't there be more evidence when comparing the meteorites than "gas bubbles"? As a number of meteorites are now classified as being from Mars, how does this number compare to what might have possibly landed on Earth? Has anyone estimated the probability that ejecta from Mars will occur, and eventually land on the Earth (as opposed to orbiting the sun, or again landing on Mars, exiting the solar system, or impacting another larger body such as Jupiter). The doubt for me would be that there are few ejecta events that produce material that exits Martian orbit, whose trajectory subsequently crosses Earth's atmosphere before impacting some other body, whose material also is large enough to survive atmospheric entry, to finally rest on land and (probability 1/3 with 2/3 ocean), specifically land untouched in a desolate area like antarctica. This seems doubtful because we keep having to multiply what would seem like small probabilities. Taking just the first item, how often do events on the Earth occur that launches rocks at escape velocity? Should we believe the claims that these rocks can be traced to Mars? 

I read in a book that "as the next millennium begins, there are more young black men in prison than in college." Jury Nullification by Clay S Conrad (Kindle edition, Dec 2013 loc: 343). (First Published 1998) Thinking "That's awful and really?" I first turned to google. $URL$ provides a statistical table for 2000-2010 indicating that there were more African Americans in college than in jail or prison in the year 2002 and thereafter. But in 2000 and 2001, there were more in jail or prison. The same article notes that: 

A google search for "denver international airport bizarre murals" turns ~50,000 hits and the first page shows a lot of similar material, much more than I would have expected. I'm wondering if these murals were ever there, or are still there, or are off in a special art gallery near the terminal, so that regular travelers would not be greeted by the images as they changed planes. If absent, then this may be a complete hoax. Even if present, a reasonable explanation for the murals would be expected. Even though Art in the United States is protected from government censorship by the First Amendment to the US Constitution as part of freedom of speech and press, I just can't imagine a busy airport sponsoring these kinds of disturbing images in the travel areas.

I've heard it said that a US citizen can escape paying US income taxes by giving up their citizenship and living in a foreign country (presumably, somewhere that has lower taxes or perhaps where a deal has been made). Is this true? If it is true, one would expect a few rich people would emigrate... then of course there is Atlas Shrugged, which is fiction -- but perpetuates this idea. Has anyone noteworthy (e.g. a multi-millionaire, or an actor or other celebrity) publicized giving up their US citizenship to escape taxation ? 

Erratic indicators show that the electronics was damaged. There was actually quite a bit of damage from this event. 

I have heard countless times the perils of global warming and how we should all do our fair share to save the Earth for future generations. Here is but one example from an NPR article: "Global Warming is Irreversible, says Study" 

Obviously this topic is something of a political football. I would be open to editorial suggestions to further pin down the question. 

ALH84001 is a famous meteorite found in Antarctica. Scientists have since claimed that (1) this meteorite came from Mars (along with several other meteorites), and (2) that it contained evidence of life. The focus here is on the first claim, that the rock comes from Mars. A game of cosmic pinball is involved. The rocks have to escape Mars gravity by some event, orbit around in space, and hit Earth before hitting something else. The NASA website explanation seems to be, more or less, "gas bubbles": 

On Sep 8 2011 on CNN television, following President Obama's speech, a breaking news item was broadcast concerning a "New Terror Threat for 9/11 Anniversary." The news item claimed that "Anniversaries are significant to Al Qaeda." I have heard this claim repeated in the past. But is this true? Have any previous attacks (worldwide) by Al Qaeda occurred on an anniversary -- either an 'obvious' date like 9/11 or an anniversary significant to the terrorists culture or goals? 

No, airplanes do not always crash from losing electronics. Here is a real-life counter-example to the claim that losing electronics would cause a loss of control of the aircraft: In 1998 a jet flew into hail, sustained damage to the electronics, and made a safe emergency landing in Chattanooga TN.

Power levels from amateur radio equipment (up to 1500 watts) are much higher than cellular phones (maybe a watt or so). However, the antenna for the 1500W radio will be at least 10 or more meters away but the cellphone can be put in your pocket, much closer to the heart , and the effect of EMF is a 1/r^2 effect. Still amateur radio is a good place to look as it has been around a lot longer. $URL$ notes that historical pacemakers has trouble with various EMF producing equipment such as microwave ovens, certain medical scanning equipment that produced 13 and 27Mhz signals, and welding equipment, but has not cited any information about deaths. It claims that modern pacemaker operation should be safe in most amateur radio environments that meet RF safety standards. $URL$ has a nice article on RF safety. It refers to an American Physical Society publication that could not link RF fields to cancer -- but you are asking about the heart.... The article also has a section on pacemaker safety. The only websites where I could find a connection between a normal heart and interference from radio transmitters (such as phones) were holistic in nature. There was also this spam embedded in an Amazon discussion group: Chronic EMF Increases Stress, Appetite, Obesity, Heart Disease, Diabetes, etc. Google "American Heart Association cellphone" only brings up concern in the context of pacemakers: From $URL$ Cellphones
