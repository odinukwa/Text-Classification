Is this because, roughly, we have nature conforming to man? ie Kants copernican revolution of objects conforming to consciousness, Hegels World conforming to Spirit and Fichtes formal concept of nature. 

But this, when you think about it involves an infinite regress of cause; this is particularly clear in the Quantum Fluctuation notion; since it requires the laws of QM to 'exist' whatever this means; but it certainly means something since there is a certain technique in physics to modify the laws that we know to see what could be otherwise, and also to find out more about what we do know. He adds: 

They include propositional, first-order & infinitary logic. The Now, what does occurance, expansion and renaming mean? (I expect isomorphism & quantification are the usual ones). I'm interested in them, because first-order logic is charactereised as the unqiue abstract logic which is compact and has the smallest possible lowenheim-skolem number. 

In Liebniz's theodicy, that his attempt to solve the problem of evil; he posits a plenitude of possible worlds. In formalism in the philosophy of mathematics which posits the plenitude of all logically consistent mathematical systems as the ground for all possible mathematics. In Lewis plural worlds where he contemplates the actual existence of all logically consistent worlds to solve traditional problems in causality and the like. 

Simple civilities, which express an attitude of courtesy, and are 'harmless'; are in fact more, 'are the small joys, the expressions of life' and are thus 'exempt from the responsibility of thought' 

The extract in the question doesn't posit an argument, but an assertion; item 5.302 in the Tractatus has: 

Not really; its the act of creation which is atemporal. Change is motion and temporal; ie within creation. 

This was noted by Kant - his famous antinomies - which motivated his critical project; however Priest credits Hegel for deciding the contradictions are unavoidable, and their underlying structure. The book runs through a history of limits; and argues for a typology; limits of: 

I wouldn't read the Tractatus, as its a difficult and obscure book written in a carefully cryptic and aphoristic style. Logicomix is much easier, its a graphic novel, and what it covers logic in the 20C when that area was kicked off by Frege. 

Brian Magee, a British philosopher, begins his autobiography by a question that possessed him as a child - why could he not be aware of falling asleep; the actual moment of the onset of sleep evaded him (he notes too, that this question did not interest his sister). The contrary question is also just as possible - to catch the moment of wakening; what would it be like to experience: would it be seeing light, before it is light? Is such an experience actually possible? 

I think this exegesis by Williams and Kirkpatrick is useful. The transcendental ego is introduced by Kant & adopted by Husserl, it lies 'above' or 'behind' consciousness. Sartre argues that the 'ego is for consciousness. The ego is "out there" in the world'. By this tactic he avoids the 'representational' epistemology of Kant. Its interesting (at least for me) whether Lacans use of topology can be usefully utilised here; this may be grounded if one can show that Lacan used existentialism in his own thinking, this being likely as he was an eclectic thinker. Given one says that the ego is 'behind' consciousness one cam visualise this as a plane behind which stands the ego, and because which ever way we look this is true, it is better modelled by a band or a sphere. Putting a twist into this band or sphere turns it into a mobius strip or klien bottle, and turns inside and outside into one smooth space: the ego is deposited outside, or the outside comes inside. 

Here, Physics is expressed in mathematical equations. The relation between the various physical entities referenced by the equation is determined exactly. This is just as true of Hiesenbergs Uncertainty principle in Quantum Mechanics as it is in Classical Physics. In this view, determinism is built into Physics itself. But, in other physical, or properly cosmological doctrines as espoused by the Milesian materialists or the Carvaka school, is this still true? 

Atoms, one imagines are solitary beings able to stand alone in the void. Experience though seems to demand a tripartite division: the experiencer, the experienced and the moment of experience itself. It seems fundamentally relational. 

First, the many-worlds interpretation of quantum physics was originally mooted by Everett as a solution to the physics-philosophical question posed by the collapse of the wave function. In the popular literature, this is often posed in terms of the consciousness of the observer (in the Copenhagen picture). This is possibly due to the Kantian influence in Western philosophy when as Kant was interested at where human consciousness meets the world, but his question was of a different order and more profound than that of quantum physics as he was tackling Humes critique of causality - which is one of the conditions of science. Now, one doesn't need a many-world picture to capture how the wave function collapses. For example, in the modern interpretation of the Copenhagen picture - the consistent histories or decoherence picture, consciousness is depromoted, one electron for example can 'observe' another. That other electron for example is external to the other. One should be clear about what Everett is attempting to do. He is taking a theory of physics as a complete picture of reality and attempting to find a new prediction. This is a respectable procedure. After all, Dirac discovered the positron on physical grounds, Einstein discovered that matter & energy were inter-convertible. But notice that one can suppose that there was an electron whose charge is positive - it seems fairly straight-forward to imagine, that matter & energy are inter-convertible less so, but it at least carries on a tradition on physics where energy is seen as a dominant paradigm. But the idea of bifurcating realities at every point of space & time at every possible interaction of electron with a photon is of an order of speculation vaster than any previously attempted! This of course does not mean that it is wrong, but one should really pause for some serious reflection as to what kind of picture of reality it is giving, and how tenable it can be. Recall, that any theory of physics is always contingent. One needs to then understand what the predictions of any one theory is, given how we see reality over all - which is essentially a common-sensical, philosophical, or theological view. I don't know enough about the philosophy of time to be able to give any sense of the contours of this question, but it does seem like a coherent question. The idea of time flowing equably at every point in space is a condition for Newtonian physics. It is generally known as absolute time. (There was also a notion of absolute space which had been abandoned by Newtons time as untenable). Liebniz had a very different picture of what space & time was which was relational rather than absolute. And there was a famous spat between Newtons supporters & Liebnizs, which to a large extent was driven by chauvinism than ideas (one still notices the political differences between the continent & the UK now). One notices in Einsteins theory that absolute time is abandoned. Simultaneity becomes a more flexible notion. Every particle carries its own clock. Of course seeing that every particle moves in spacetime what can it mean for a particle to carry its own clock? It means that the clock measures time for them as they move. Ishmael & Layla are together, their consciousness are at the same time & place because they occupy the same time & place, because that is what being together means. But Ishmael decides to move away, can one say that their consciousness is now together or simultaneous? From a distance Layla sees that Ishmaels consciousness has slowed down paradoxically because his life has accelerated. They both move on. He returns. He isn't much older, she has aged. Time has moved at a pace different for each of them. Can one say then that consciousness has been for both of them simultaneous for both whilst they were together and whilst they were apart and again together? If we lived in a possible world where the speed of light was not much higher than walking speed we would have a profoundly different idea of what time is and how it operates as we would be immediately conscious of differences that can only be intellectualised now.
