Executive summary: the sparrow is the lover, and the robin is the child [thank you @PeterShor for cutting through the undergrowth]. Which might well invalidate my interpretation below :o) Why a robin? If you go here you'll find a link to a sample of robin birdsong, with the narration [emphasis mine]: 

I'll leave the Freudian interpretation of those authors’ apparent disgust of coitus to the reader³ ... 

The this refers to the preceding phrase or dialogue; crossly means gruffly or with ill grace. The repetition is purely for emphasis. The meaning, from context, is that people who live along the big highways resent the traffic. In the first case, although many of them are more than willing to sell produce, or a painting, to the passing motorists (represented metaphorically as the cars themselves rather than the drivers) in order to have a share of the affluence possessed and represented by the city folk, they are less willing (you can keep your money) to do so when the impatient motorist relieves their frustration by whining at the proprietor (being mean). In the second case, the motorist is asking desperately for help in some random location, short of gas, and hoping against hope that one of these rural dwellers has a supply of fuel of which they can spare a little (and are not begging, but asking to buy it). The askee is again grumpily responding, but presenting the asker as foolish to expect such a thing, and (perhaps a little unfairly) questioning their observational skills. The final stanza is a confession that the author isn't superior to the country folk after all. 

Whereas, for example, The Cambridge History of English Literature (though it refers to The Blossom merely in passing) has this to say: 

In other words, a celebration of that ethic, rather than cynicism. This blog post suggests a rather more “adult” reading: 

Is he actually telling the truth here? It is perfectly true that certain people were arguing for extreme measures sooner, that Mr. Thompson had resisted such extreme measures, and that it was Mr. Thompson's idea to negotiate with John Galt rather than to kill him like Robert Stadler wanted to. Is he actually worried that they'd killed him? Or is this a veiled threat (i.e. "either cooperate or I'll let the dogs off the leash")? Or is he trying to manipulate her into trying to contact John Galt knowing that he's having her watched? Or is it some combination of the above? 

I don't have the exact reference in front of me, but Ayn Rand deliberately referred to Mr. Thompson as the "Head of State" (rather than the President of the United States) because she felt that the title of "President of the United States" was still an honorable title that wouldn't be fitting to someone like Mr. Thompson. I'm not aware of a quote from her describing a specific reason that she referred to Congress as "the legislature." It's at least hinted that there had been major structural changes to the government. The first fact that at least hints at that was the references to "the legislature" and "Head of State" that you mentioned. Secondly, the fact that Colorado seemed to enjoy considerably more liberty than the rest of the country (but was still evidently part of the U.S.) may imply that it enjoyed at least some degree of autonomy that's different than the current structure. Third was the fact that so much was done by regulatory actions from Wesley Mouch (although that's seen as borderline illegal and somewhat irregular at several points in the novel; for example, Wesley evidently didn't have the legal authority to directly seize patents when he issued Directive 10-289, and he's at least occasionally seen whining about his supposed need for broader powers). On the other hand, the fact that Judge Narragansett was seen editing the Constitution may imply that the U.S. was still at least nominally following the Constitution (although it's uncertain what, if any, amendments to it had been passed at that point). The previous two paragraphs, of course, aren't definitively answered in the book (just hinted at). 

In this case God is speaking to the serpent in the Garden of Eden; the "he" is speaking of Eve's descendants (any and all of them) and hence including, in the story, Ransom. Weston thus represents - well, is - the metaphorical serpent. 

What's the difference between the sparrow and the robin? It seems likely Blake's intent was to show how two people in apparently identical circumstances can seem very happy or very sad. Given the odesmith’s approach to life, the title of the collection, and the context (a lot of relatively “clean” sexual imagery exists in the rest of the poems) this may be contrasting blithe, naïve, youthful spirits with sad and wiser men like Coleridge’s wedding guest. Nowadays we might call the latter jaded. Comparison with The Clod and the Pebble. This may be compared with its companion poem, The Clod and the Pebble, which also illustrates two opposing responses to the world and to “love” in particular. I think that case is slightly different, largely because it’s clearer there why the responses are different. The clod speaks of what the Greeks¹ termed agápē (ἀγάπη), and the pebble of what they dubbed érōs (ἔρως), but the pebble deprecates the latter by implying it is selfish. Other opinions a.k.a. remember please always to call it “research”. I think anything beyond that is too debatable (I've had a quick Google search and found two almost diametrically opposed analyses) to commit to a single concrete answer… At one end of the spectrum are the rather down-to-earth views of the poem’s imagery (the whole natural cycle-of-life thing, with commentators varying in their perceptions of how full the glass is). For example, a description of the poem on a popular Cliff's Notes–style website says 

He goes on to point out the obvious imagery in the arrow and cradle narrow. At the more spiritual, symbolic, ethereal, wispy end of the spectrum, we have this article from the now-defunct Colby Quarterly. It begins by lambasting the “sexual imagery” interpretation, with the scathing if somewhat pathetic critique: 

According to Sartre himself, they could have refused. In the many time misquoted "L'enfer, c'est les autres" ("Hell is other people"), Sartre made it clear that he did not imply people would always torture each other, but rather, that flawed relationship would always push people to hell, as there was nothing more important to us that the view of others. Hence, the reason why the characters end up torturing each other would be that their relationships are flawed, at least according to the Comments on Huis Clos, 1964 that I reproduce here (translation is mine, if you find a more satisfactory one I would be please to edit it in). 

(George Orwell, 1984) It is made very clear early on in the book that under IngSoc, what you would call cultural/national background is despised and probably in way of disappearing. Newspeak would therefore not be adapted to languages that are already banned. Another possibility though, would be that Newspeak collected some local linguistic structures (Orwell says "formations"), as any language that becomes dominant after a transitional period. This is possible, but the following extract rules it out for the "purest" of Newspeak: before Newspeak became global, it was already purified of most English influences. 

No he did not! The process can be traced back at least to Thomas Carlyle, who in Sartor Resartus (1833–34) publishes a summary and a critique, à la Borges, of the fictional book Clothes, Their Origin and Influence. Let's note that Thomas Carlyle pushed it even further than Borges, publishing the review in a magazine with no mention of its fictional nature! While book 1 is a comment mainly of (pseudo-)philosophical nature, the readers of Fraser's Magasine would find, in the begging of book 2, a fiction of what is deemed as a summary of Clothes, Their Origin and Influence. Even better: he knew he did not 

Artax was evidently profoundly affected by the Swamp of Sadness, eventually sinking into a deep depression. However, the Swamp had no effect whatever on Atreyu, which Artax thought was likely due to him wearing the Amulet. That being the case, why didn't Artax just go back and wait for Atreyu outside of the swamp? 

The fact that he fully accepted and embraced that was actually evidence that he was loyal to the party (not that he was disloyal). He also shows a good deal of confidence in the Party's ability to literally alter history. He claims that the past exists only in people's memory and in written records, and that the Party controls both, so when they rewrite history it literally becomes true. 

Related: Why did people appear to remember what was going on at the time they left England when they returned from Narnia? The books aren't very explicit on this point, so here are a few possibilities. Their time in the "other world" takes on a "dreamlike quality" While they're in one world, the world that they just left has a "dreamlike quality" - there was some sense in which Narnia was like an extended dream while they were in England (and vice versa for England while they were in Narnia). This would explain why, for example, they seem to have remembered details about what was going on when they left England when they returned. They evidently didn't remember the lamp-post until after they got back to England (prior to getting back to England, they only had a vague recollection of having seen it before), and they didn't seem all that disoriented when they got back to England. They appear to have remembered where they were and why they were there. (They even remembered to apologize to the Professor for losing some of his coats). This is much like you remember your whereabouts when you wake up from a dream. The influence of the world itself The world itself seems to have a good deal of influence on the characters' behavior, thought patterns, and even skills. It will often take hours or days in Narnia for characters to regain all of the skills that they had gained last time they were there. This would imply that, when they return to England, they don't really retain all of their adult-like traits or skills, which would seem to make it easier for them to transition back. They did have trouble, but the books didn't address that The books actually don't describe much about their lives outside Narnia. In fact, in most cases, the books spend only as much time in England as is required to set up the story. (An obvious counterexample, though, is when Caspian and Aslan go to England briefly, but even then they're clearly "out of context" - that's fundamentally Narnians setting something about our world right, not just a story about England). After all, the books are the Chronicles of Narnia, not the chronicles of the characters' lives in England - the books are fundamentally about Narnia. One could argue that, in one sense, they're even more about Narnia than they are about the characters themselves - i.e. the books are fundamentally "about" things that certain people did In Narnia, not merely about those particular characters. Genuine plot hole It's quite possible that this is a genuine plot hole, and that C. S. Lewis either didn't think of it or didn't think that it was important enough to the stories to address. (The latter point could be related to the previous point - i.e. it's not important because the books aren't about the characters' actions outside of Narnia).
