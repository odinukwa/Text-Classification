I was reading this article called Aristotle on the fourth figure. Thea author while exposing Aristotle theory of syllogism, identify 3 kinds of syllogisms which believes Aristotle to discuss: 

I'm looking for some in depth clarification, can we consider the reduction to absurdum a syllogism? If yes, in which contexts? in which case? why? PS: This question is related to this one I asked, but being the questions both broad I decided to separate them, even though the understanding of one is linked to that of the other. 

In his critique to Boole and the other algebraic logicians, Frege make a strong use of what is known as "the Priority Principle". The Priority Principle expresses Frege belief that our investigation of the thoughts, should start with considering judgments (thoughts) and not concepts. What I got is that Frege thinks that the Booleans just developed concepts upon Aristotele's logic ( giving a mathematical foundation to it), without investigating if the judgements (categorical and hypotetical sentences?) really represents our thoughts. From that his attempt to revisit what sentences really mean in our language and the consequent introduction of quantifiers...Did I get it right? It may possibly be all wrong because as stated in the question I didn't find a general definition of what judgment and concept mean for Frege, so I tried to extrapolate them but I think I still need clarification. 

To put the answers, so far, another way, on Fred's account, George's distance from faith to conclusion is much longer than Fred's and so George is likely to be more consistent overall. While consistency is not the end all and be all, it seems better to more consistent than less. 

You have proposed two moral principles: 1) You don't want to be a "wage slave" (as you define it). 2) You don't want to live on the resources of others. There are two assumptions a) working for yourself is not readily available and b) you want to survive. In the context of the assumptions, the two moral principles are, on their face, inconsistent -- a common human problem. We usually try to live with the inconsistency, using one principle at one time and the other at another depending on the situation or our emotional state. Alternatively, you could choose one and jettison the other. In doing so you will have to compare their value. Which principle does the most good? Which one can you live with? Under what circumstances would you be able to change your mind? As is typical, I have answered a question with more questions. 

Yes. The most obvious and quick answer to your question is: Do you know for sure that there is no Strong AI in existence right now? If your answer is no (which it should be), then you must also believe that it is possible for Strong AI to exist without us being certain that it can exist. Another, more long-winded one: Based on the constraints of your scenario, this happens in a world in which Strong AI is possible. In such a world, the entirety of intelligence and consciousness are nothing more than physical processes. IE: The physicalist approach to the mind/body problem is the correct one. I suppose one could argue that Strong AI doesn't require a mind to exist, but I feel like if you redefine Strong AI that way you're not talking about what we normally think of as Strong AI. If this is the case, then there is no fundamental difference between the thoughts of a person and the actions of a computer, we're just programmed differently. While the effects of the algorithm, or the effects of human thought are difficult or impossible to predict with precision, the fact remains that they are purely the result of physical processes. The system, while perhaps very very complex, ultimately boils down to interactions between molecules. So the question of whether we will "realize" that Strong AI is possible is unrelated to the truth-value of whether it is possible, our "realizations" are merely a complex interaction of molecules. There is no reason to suspect that the existence of AI will send out molecules/waves of light that will interact with the cells in our brains in such a way that we will "realize" that it is possible to create AI. 

The definition seems to imply that THE SM has to have all of the listed attributes. Otherwise it is just defining A SM, a collective set of methods which are scientific, i.e., those methods which include some of the listed attributes and none of their negations. For example, someone who just observes and reports on the behavior of snails could be a scientist. And a mathematician, who just formulates hypotheses and tries to prove them could also be a scientist. They would be scientists if they do what they are doing methodically, taking into account prior efforts. I question whether any scientific method can or should be used to give either a necessary or a sufficient condition to determine if something is "science." 

If you are looking for a congregation of almost all atheists which provides religious-like activities such a Sunday school, baby naming ceremonies, memorial services, wedding ceremonies and a community nurtured by regular meetings, you should try Ethical Culture. Ethical Culture congregations are located primarily in the northeast from Washington to Boston. The biggest congregations are in St. Louis and Washington. There are also congregations in Texas, North Carolina, Silicon Valley, and a few other places. Check the website of the American Ethical Union for more information. (Disclosure: I am a member of the Baltimore Ethical Society and the AHA). Some Ethical Culture Societies are affiliated with the American Humanist Association (AHA). Other Humanist related congregations in which atheists can feel comfortable include The Society for Humanistic Judaism, Reconstructionist (Jewish), some but not all Unitarian-Universalist congregations, and some Buddhist groups. Each of these secular congregations has found their own way to make peace with religion, the professed dominant culture in the US and most Western countries. You might also investigate Humanism, which, for some, is a philosophy and, for others, a big tent encompassing ideas that range from Naturalism to Deism. The AHA is a strong advocate for Secularism; it publishes books and a monthly magazine and it holds an annual conference. In all these venues various non-theistic ideas are discussed. For reading, I suggest the 2009 book "Good Without God: What a Billion Nonreligious People Do Believe" by Greg M. Epstein, the Humanist Chaplain at Harvard. It contains a nice Appendix with thumbnail sketches and contacts for over a dozen "Humanist and Secular Resources." 

This is interesting to me, as it would seem that without an ability to freely choose between alternative explanations according to which seems more reasonable, rational thought is undermined. I am trying to work my way through portions of Critique of Pure Reason, but I am having trouble getting my head around it. Can anyone explain Kant's view that rationality and determinism are compatible, if the above quote indeed does reflect Kant's view? If it is somehow incorrect, can anyone explain what he actually held to be the case? 

The language in the first statement is meant to invoke a hypothetical scenario, whereas in the second I am merely making a statement about the world as it currently is. The difference has to do with the truth value of the statement itself. A Material Conditional statement is true as long as for every situation in which the first part is true, the second part is also true. It makes no guarantees about the logical coherence of the statement when applied to hypothetical situations. Technically any statement of P->Q is true as long as either P is false or both P and Q are true, regardless of whether or not there is any causal connection between P and Q. A Counterfactual is making a statement about necessity that states that regardless of the current truth value of P, if things were ever in a condition in which P were the case, Q would also be the case. Here is an example I stole from wikipedia to illustrate the difference: Counterfactual: If I were in Poland, I would be in Europe. (true, though the method to evaluate such truth is hotly contested) Material Conditional: If I were in Poland, I would be in Africa (also true, because I am not in Poland so this has no binding effect on the truth or falsehood of the second part) What we usually want when we discuss things in real life is the counter-factual. It is not making a claim about the real world only, but also about hypothetical ones. This is how we usually think and what we mean in colloquial speech when we say "If... then..." most of the time.
