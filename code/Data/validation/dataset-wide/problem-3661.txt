Yes, it is ok. According to some research, e.g. NY Times- 4 minute workout once a week of 4 minutes high intensity training is enough to improve. Similar as Mosley of BBC recommends. My own experience is that if you fill the high intensity training sessions with full body exercises that engage all of your posterior chain, (e.g. burpees or kettlebell swings) you will also improve/sustain your strength. This way the other workouts can be focused on improving specific skills, e.g. swimming, running, or team sports such as football, basketball, etc. 

Various warm up drills for swimming that are integrated in a swim workout can be found at - for example - Swim work out generator 

Choosing a "train - no pain" path is interesting. The question has two parts: A. Tips on advancing the workout B. Studies on pleasureable and painless workouts. A. A general tip on advancing the suggested workoutis to work on the technique of your exercises. Squats, as an example, film yourself doing squats, compare & contrast with how it is done by masters you know or on what you can see on the net. Log your improvements in technique instead of logging the increased weight. B. Google Scholar: "joyful physical training Various papers about how to increase the motivation when the focus of training is to have fun, especially for children. Google Scholar: "light physical training", one paper that was interesting is that rats training at 60% of VO2max (i.e. moderate exercise) also show an increase in bone growth. Given that your motivation is increased following your way, you can increase the chance of training over a longer period of time which is good for you, see Google Scholar: life long training, here the study of "Physical Activity and Muscle Training in the Elderly" shows that the body responds to resistance traning into the 70s. 

Protein always helps with recovery. Recommend carb / protein mix within first 20 minutes to maximize nutrient uptake. Also ensure you are getting enough calcium to prevent bone injuries. Best of luck. 

Do bird-dogs without lifting your arms. From the quadruped position, lift one leg straight back so it is parallel to the floor. Lower it back to the ground. Repeat with the other leg. For maximum results, place a dowel rod on across your lower back and do the exercises without the dowel falling off. Focuses on activating glutes without rotating hips. Can do 100 of these a day as this is neuromuscular (activating) and produces best results with maximum volume. Do 1 legged bridges but with your knee held to your chest. Lay on your back in a situp position. Pull one knee to your chest and hold it tightly in place. Squeeze your glutes (not hamstrings) and lift up into a bridge position so shoulder to knee is a straight line. Hold for 3 seconds. Lower. Repeat. This is a strengthening and activating exercise but it can cause strain on the lower back and hamstrings if not done correctly. Start with 1 set of 5 to each side. Increase up to 3 sets a day once you are ready. Once you can handle 3 sets a day, increase the reps by 5. For stretches, do the newspaper stretch. Hold for 3 minutes per side in order to lengthen the muscles. 30 seconds will make you feel better but more time is needed to actually lengthen the tissue. Good luck. 

Besides the excellent advice in the other responses, I would like to add some points: First, only run when it is cold if you really have to, for example, Sunday January 13th, in Stockholm it was -9 Celcius (C) (16 Fahrenheit (F)) (-15 C considering the wind chill factor). A warmer Sunday, you would see lots of people running at the popular city parks Djurgården and Gärdet. That day, you hardly saw anyone. So even when you have a large population used to cold weather & snow & ice , most of them avoid intense outdoor exercise in the cold. The key reasons are that it is difficult to breathe (even if you are used to cold air) and the risks of falling. As a guideline, youth cross country skiers are not allowed to compete under -15 C (5 F), primarily because of the breathing and frostbite risks. Outdoors ice hockey games are cancelled if the temperature is below, -18 C (0 F). In both of these contexts, the participants are used to cold weather and in excellent shape. 

Searching for "massage flexibility" on Google scholar shows a large numbers of results. An overview of the result is that: Massage in general seems to be as good as stretching for flexibility and Thai massage seems to be at least as good as Swedish massage (the most popular type of massage practised in the US). However, massage differs from stretching, e.g. see caring hormones massage and seems to be better for recovery. When to do the massage is harder to find research on. My personal experience of Thai massage is that properly done, it is relaxing but also makes you a bit tired afterwards. So in terms of doing it before or after workouts, it makes more sense to do it after workouts or on recovery days. In an ideal world, perhaps all exercise should be followed by massage but the time and cost would be prohabitive. So your plan of massage twice a month seems to be reasonable. 

Depends on your race distance. For races involving mostly aerobic energy, I think you are ok to stick to the simple 10-15 minute "get blood flowing" warm up. For races that involve more anerobic energy, try this 30 minutes before you race. 1) 10 minutes easy designed to get blood in the legs and the lungs. 2) 2-3 minutes a little below race intensity. 3) 30 seconds a little above race intensity. 4) 60 second easy jog. 5) a few strides If the race is less than a 1600, break the 2-3 minutes into 2 45 second intervals below race intensity with 30 second jog between. This gets blood to the desired areas, increases heart beat and also makes the brain adjust to faster than race pace so race pace seems easier. Good luck and good running. 

Great question. Progressive loading is the best strategy. In other words, start easy and increase load (difficulty, stress) as you gain strength. In my experience, it is best to train each pathway independently when possible, at least at first. Part of this reason is that lactate (anaerobic conditioning) interferes with the production of the aerobic enzyme. Would recommend aerobic to be the base of everything you do with anaerobic load to gradually increase. For example, in week 1 of training, perhaps only do 10-15% anaerobic work such as hill sprints or suicides. As you get closer to key competitions, gradually build the anaerobic portion up to maybe 50% of total work. The aerobic conditioning will always be the key though. As the season progresses, mixing the two and game scrimmages will allow for better development. It is crucial that hard days are followed by easy days as well. The Creatine Phosphate system can be developed at all times of the season. The key to ATP-CP development is the work (7-10 seconds max) and rest periods (3-5 minutes). 3 great ways to develop ATP-CP? 1) 60m accelerations to top speed. Turn around, walk back, wait 3 minutes before doing another. 2) Short hill sprints up a steep incline lasting no more than 7-10 seconds. Jog back, rest 3 minutes. 3) Deadlifts at 85% max with 2-3 reps. KEY TO NOT GAINING MASS is to rest 5 minutes between sets and no more than 2 or 3 sets. This exercise does wonders to also gain speed endurance. EVERY athlete can benefit from this regardless of sport and it can be performed 3 times a week. 

As you can see, I have assumed that last 5 exercises up to December 6 where of different effort and different lengths. Effort in Firstbeat is measured in Training effect. Then the system recommends a workout for December 7, rest day for December 8, a light workout for the 9th etc. In the bottom right corner, you can see how the system gradually increases the weekly EPOC load, through a mix of easy, hard exercises and workout length. Your optimal effort per week is then to be in the "grey" zone of the diagram in the bottom right. I have used the system for about 5 years now, for all my workouts (resistance training, yoga and swimming). It has helped me to avoid training too hard. 

I did a quick read through of the search "eating nuts health risk" at Google Scholar at limited the search to 2012 and later, see $URL$ It does not seem to be any health risks. A search for "eating nuts gaining weight" on the same source, see $URL$ and a quick reading of the abstracts shows some result that seem to contradict that nuts are especially effective for weight gain. 10-12 years ago when I was overweight (BMI>26), the main cause was a high consumption of protein shakes and too little exercise. My idea behind the shakes was to reduce stress and I read in a book about stress that high intake of proteins would reduce stress hormones. 

Running downhill is the BEST way to strengthen your quad muscles. Often we build muscle imbalances by continually running uphill which does great for glutes, hamstrings, hip flexors. Downhill pounds the quads but strengthens them. How to downhill run effectively 1) Focus on being tall and relaxed 2) Slight forward lean 3) Use the "big muscles" to cushion the landing as opposed to pounding your shins. Based on the work by Arthur Lydiard I recommend short downhill strides coupled with uphill "sprints" to fully maximize your running strength (which does wonders for endurance, coincidentally). Sample Beginner Workout Week 1 - Short hills 10 seconds up a steep hill at 90-95% effort (almost all out). Walk back down. (Walking backwards down the hill can eccentrically stress the hamstring meaning more strength). Rest 2 minutes. Repeat 2 times total. Can do this AFTER an easy run. Week 2 - Long hills 30 seconds up a gradual hill at a medium hard to hard pace (not all out), walk back down halfway, gently run the last hall focusing on using the big muscles for cushion. Rest 2 minutes. Repeat 4 times total. Week 3 - Short Hills 4 times Week 4 - Long Hills 6 times Week 5 - Short Hills 6 times Week 6 - Long Hills 8 times Additionally, add a half mile to a mile of a gradual hill to your long run each week to help with aerobic power. Finally with hills, recommend no more than 2-3 times per week and always try to keep a minimum of one or 2 days between hill sessions. You will be sore, especially in the early going but by focusing on form and using your glutes, hips, hamstrings and quads, you will get stronger quickly. Good luck. 

Check their service agreement, sometimes things break down (this happens to all manufacturers based on discussions at e.g. Funbeat and other training forums) and the guarantee and replacement service is important. My experience from Suunto is that there are no questions asked, almost overnight replacement and very helpful customer service. Others that have Polar etc have similar experiences. Check how open they are (e.g. support for ANT+) and support for exporting measurement data from client/web software. Garmin supports ANT+ (they even bought the company behind the standard). Check how easy it is for simpler do it yourself maintenance, e.g. change batteries. No problems with Suunto. 

My own rule of thumb for strength training is to start 2 months earlier - that is, in your example, the break period - in the workout routines and to proceed from there with a 1-2 week reboot period. After that and only if it feels ok, I try to proceed at the levels when the break period started. So I guess I am leaning towards the second part of your question, to stay with the routines but have lighter weights. My own experience is that break periods should be part of the training cycle, it is natural to get bored and have other priorities from time to time. I see the reboot routines as opportunities to work on techniques for my favorite exercises (deadlift, squats and military press). 

I had simiar issues until I discovered towel toe curls. Simply take off your shoes and socks and stand over a towel. Place the toes of your right foot on the towel and keep your heel on the floor. Use your toes to "curl" the towel back towards your body. It is like you are pulling the towel towards you using your toes. Do 50 reps to the right foot. Do 50 reps to the left foot. Do every day for 2 weeks and then every other as maintenance. Good luck. 

Definitely think you can go sub 25 minutes. The key with running is "Accumulated fitness". The more often you run and the more consistently (say 4 days a week for an entire year), the better you will become. So how do you get there? 1) Run often - minimum 4 days a week but slowly see if you can fit 5 or even 6 days a week into your schedule 2) Run consistently - run every week. Don't skip. 3) Add variety - vary your pace, vary your distance, add intervals, add distance, etc. 4) Extend your long run - try to get to 90 minutes by adding 5 minutes a week. Once you get to 90 minutes, try to make the run faster. One week make the last 5 minutes medium. Next week make the last 10 minutes medium, etc. Good luck! Let us know how you progress. P.S. I have worked with runners of all age groups. Anyone that has 1) desire to improve 2) discipline in training and diet and 3) even a small bit of athletic talent can improve. I have seen the following as good age goals for male "non-runners" under 30 - 21:00 30 - 40 - 24:00 40 - 50 - 25:00 50+ - 26:00
