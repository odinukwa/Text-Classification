If the $X_i$ are i.i.d. Gaussian with variance $1$, then you have $$ c_p := \mathbb{E} |X_k|^p = \frac{2^{p/2} \Gamma(\frac{p+1}{2})}{\sqrt{\pi}}.$$ The variable $S_n$ is also Gaussian with variance $n$, therefore you have $$\mathbb{E} |S_n|^p = c_p n^{p/2}.$$ Hence, $\frac{\sum_{k=1}^n \mathbb{E} |X_k|^p}{\mathbb{E} |S_n|^p} = n^{1-p/2} \rightarrow \infty$ for $1<p<2$. At least, it means that you cannot hope for a constant $C$ as you expected. 

Consider the Besov spaces $B_{p,q}^s(\mathbb{R}^d)$ for parameters $0<p,q\leq \infty$ and $s\in \mathbb{R}$. The weighted Besov space $B_{p,q}^s(\mathbb{R}^d;\mu)$ is defined for $\mu \in \mathbb{R}$ by $$ f \in B_{p,q}^s(\mathbb{R}^d;\mu) \Leftrightarrow (1 + \lvert \cdot \rvert^2)^{\mu/2} f \in B_{p,q}^s(\mathbb{R}^d). $$ It is know that the space $B_{p_1,q_1}^{s_1}(\mathbb{R}^d;\mu_1)$ embeds into $B_{p_2,q_2}^{s_2}(\mathbb{R}^d;\mu_2)$ under the conditions $$ s_2 < s_1, \quad p_1 \leq p_2, \quad s_2 - \frac{d}{p_2} \leq s_1 - \frac{d}{p_1}, \quad \mu_2 \leq \mu_1. $$ See for instance the chapter 4 of Function Spaces, Entropy Numbers, Differential Operators, by Edmunds and Triebel, available here. Question: Are there embeddings results from $B_{p_1,q_1}^{s_1}(\mathbb{R}^d;\mu_1)$ into $B_{p_2,q_2}^{s_2}(\mathbb{R}^d;\mu_2)$ for $p_1 > p_2$? Inspired by $L_p$-spaces, my guess is that we still have similar results, with the cost of a stronger condition on the weights, something like $\mu_2 \leq \mu_1 - d(1/p_2 - 1/p_1)$, remarking that $d(1/p_2 - 1/p_1) > 0$ in this case. However, I couldn't find a precise statement of that type. I am looking for a good reference for this question. 

For infinitely divisible random variables, Blumenthal and Getoor introduced in [1] an index that allow to study for instance the local Hölder regularity of Lévy processes. For a symmetric infinitely divisible random variable $X$ with characteristic exponent $\psi$ and Lévy measure $\nu$, we have in particular \begin{align} \beta &= \inf \{ p>0; \frac{\psi(t)}{\lvert t \rvert^p} \underset{\lvert t \rvert \rightarrow \infty}{\longrightarrow} 0 \} \\ &= \inf \{ \alpha >0 ; \int_{|x|< 1} |x|^\alpha \nu (\mathrm{d}x) <\infty\}. \end{align} Knowing the Lévy measure, it is in general straightforward to find $\beta$. However, for some infinitely divisible laws, the Lévy measure does not seem to be known. Typically, for the best of my knowledge, this is the case for the student $t$-distribution $$p_v(x) \propto (1+x^2)^{-\frac{v+1}{2}}, $$ which is shown to be infinitely divisible (cf. [2]). Is the Blumenthal-Getoor index of $p_v$ known? [1] R. M. Blumenthal and R. K. Getoor, Sample functions of stochastic processes with stationary independent increments, J. Math.

I am using the notations, definitions, and results of the Section X of [1] on generalized Orlicz spaces. We say that $\varphi : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$ is a $\varphi$-function if it is symmetric, nondecreasing, continuous, and satisfies $\varphi(0) = 0$. Then, for a measure space $(\Omega, \Sigma, \mu)$ and $\varphi$ a $\varphi$-function, $L^{\varphi}(\mu)$ is the set of measurable functions $f : \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that \begin{equation} \rho_\varphi (\alpha f) := \int_{\Omega} \varphi( \alpha f ) \mathrm{d}\mu < \infty \end{equation} for some $\alpha > 0$. We call $L^\varphi(\mu)$ a generalized Orlicz space. We set \begin{align} \lVert f \rVert_\varphi = \inf \{ k > 0, \int_{\Omega} \varphi \left( \frac{\alpha f }{k}\right) \mathrm{d}\mu \leq k\}. \end{align} Then, $(L^{\varphi}(\mu),\lVert \cdot \rVert_\varphi)$ is a complete linear metric space (after identifying $f_1$ and $f_2$ when $\lVert f_1 - f_2 \rVert_\varphi = 0$), cf. [1], Section X, Theorem 2. Question: Consider a continuous and linear operator $\mathrm{L}$ between two generalized Orlicz spaces $L^\varphi(\mu)$ and $L^\psi(\mu)$. When is it true that there exists a constant $C>0$ such that \begin{equation} \rho_\psi(\mathrm{L} f) \leq C \rho_\varphi(f) \end{equation} for every $f \in L^\varphi(\mu)$? Some motivations: When the function $\varphi$ is convex, $\rho_\varphi$ defines a norm on $L^\varphi(\mu)$ that is therefore a Banach space. We talk in that case of Orlicz spaces. Here, we do not assume that $\varphi$ is convex, and not even that $\varphi$ goes to infinity at infinity. This situation occurs in the study of infinitely divisible random variables taking values in spaces of infinite dimension, see for instance [2]. Still, $\mathrm{L}$ being continuous and linear, it is bounded for the metrics $\lVert \cdot \rVert_{\varphi}$ and $\lVert \cdot \rVert_{\psi}$ but it is not so clear to me what can we say for the quantities $\rho_{\varphi}$ and $\rho_{\psi}$ in the general case.

I believe the number of proper definitions of the term "quantum group" is some element of $\mathbb R \setminus \{1\}$. Even the simplest example, the quantized enveloping algebra of $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb C)$, has at least two definitions (more if you count the coproduct as part of the definition). If you are careful with the details, as for example in Jantzen's book "Introduction to Quantum Groups", you either get bogged down in the details of left-right compatibilites and twisted coproducts or, more in the spirit of the subject, you change the definition midway. 

Short version: if $G$ is a Coxeter group and $H \subset G$ is a parabolic subgroup, both acting on a space $V$, is it true that the invariant-coinvariant algebra $(S(V)_G)^H$ has a natural bilinear form induced by taking coefficients in the top component? Now the long, detailed version. Let $G$ be a Coxeter group acting on a real vector space $V$ with a fixed generating set of reflections $S$. We can form the symmetric algebra $S(V)$, the invariant subalgebra $S(V)^G \subset S(V)$, and the ideal $I_G \subset S(V)$ generated by elements of $S(V)^G$ of positive degree. The coinvariant algebra is defined as $S(V)_G = S(V)/I_G$. By the Cehvalley-Shephard-Todd theorem it is isomorphic to the regular representation of $G$ as a $G$-module. If $H \subset G$ is a parabolic subgroup then the $H$-invariants $(S(V)_G)^H$ form a subalgebra of $S(V)_G$, which is finite dimensional and whose top nonzero component is $1$-dimensional over $\mathbb R$, say spanned by $s$. Then $(S(V)_G)^H$ has a nice bilinear pairing given by taking $(f,g)$ to be the coefficient of $s$ in the product $fg$ for all $f, g \in (S(V)_G)^H$. If $G$ is a Weyl group, the algebra $(S(V)_G)^H$ is isomorphic to the cohomology ring of a generalized flag variety by a famous theorem of Borel. Plus the bilinear form described above is the pullback of the Poincaré pairing in said cohomology, and in particular it is nondegenerate. Questions: 

Let $H$ be a Hopf algebra and $A$ an $H$-comodule algebra; denote by $M^H_A$ the category of right $(H,A)$-Hopf modules [i.e. $A$-module, $H$-comodules, everything is compatible with everything else]. I would like to know if there is an analogue of Baer's criterion for the category $M^H_A$; in other words, 

I am surprised no one has mentioned any examples from physics. Fluid mechanics for example obtains some beautiful results by assuming that a fluid is continuous, while at the molecular level it is a discrete object. An example from my physics highschool textbook: 

I am reading A. Yekutieli's original article on dualizing complexes for noncommutative algebras and I found a problem I cannot solve. First, some background. We start with a field $k$ and a noetherian $\mathbb N$-graded algebra $A$ and assume that $A_0 = k$. All objects are graded, and we write $\mathcal A$ for the category of graded $A$-bimodules. A dualizing complex is an object $R^\bullet$ in the derived category $\mathcal D(\mathcal A)$ satisfying the following: 

The problem is easier to solve if we think of the grain as a fluid and apply, say, Pascal's principle. 

Both are instances of a more general version of Baer's criterion for Grothendieck categories with a family of generators [which I've seen mentioned yet never found a proof], but I haven't been able to adapt this to the general context. 

I have been looking for a couple of days for the answer to this question to no avail. Let me define what $\Sigma$-injective is. 

Can the non-degeneracy of the bilinear form be proved by purely combinatorial methods, without appealing to Borel's theorem? Can it be extended to all pairs $(G,H)$ where $G$ is just a finite Coxeter group? 

The Bass-Papp theorem states that $R$ is left noetherian if and only if the direct sum of an arbitrary family of injective left $R$-modules is again injective, so noetherian rings have the property I am looking for, but I was wondering if the fact that every injective is $\Sigma$-injective is equivalent to some classical ring-theoretical property. 

This is a more general fact: Let $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is a surjective morphism between irreducible varieties. Then $dim(Y)\leq dim(X)$. Furthermore: 

In particular you can find details about both Mayer-Vietoris and Leray Spectral sequences. Another good reference: 

This has been a breakthrough in the direction of Hartshorne's conjecture on complete intersections. Before it was known just for very special varieties and for Fano varieties of codimension two. You can find all of this in this paper: $URL$ 

You can argue also in the following way (let us do the case of two componets $E_1$, $E_2$ for simplicity of notation. The general case will be clear): the intersection matrix $$ I = \left(\begin{array}{cc} E_1^2 & E_1E_2 \\ E_1E_2 & E_2^2 \end{array}\right) $$ is negative definite. In particular if you take the vector $a=(a_1,a_2)$ you get $$a\cdot I\cdot a^{t} = a_1^2E_1^2+2a_1a_2E_1E_2+a_2^2E_2^2 <0.$$ On the other hand $$a_1^2E_1^2+2a_1a_2E_1E_2+a_2^2E_2^2 = a_1E_1(a_1E_1+a_2E_2)+a_2E_2(a_1E_1+a_2E_2)<0.$$ Since $a_1,a_2>0$ the last inequality yields either $E_1(a_1E_1+a_2E_2)<0$ or $E_2(a_1E_1+a_2E_2)<0$. 

Note that without any assumption on the singularities the answer to your question is yes. For instance, consider the hypersurface $Y = \{x_0^2+x_1^3+x_2^4\}\subset\mathbb{P}^3$. Then $Sing(Y) = [0:0:0:1]$. The projective tangent cone of $Y$ in the singular point is not reduced. Therefore, the singularity is not ordinary. Let $\pi:X\rightarrow\mathbb{P}^3$ be the blow-up of $[0:0:0:1]$. It is easy to check that the singular locus of the strict transform $\widetilde{Y}\subset X$ contains a curve. On the other hand, if the singularities are ordinary this can not happen. More precisely: Let $W\subset Z\subset X$ be smooth projective varieties, and let $Y\subset X$ be a projective variety such that $Sing(Y) = Z$ and $Y$ has ordinary singularities along $Z$. Let $\pi_W:X_W\rightarrow X$ be the blow-up of $W$, and $Z_W$, $Y_W$ the strict transforms of $Z$ and $Y$ respectively. Then $Sing(Y_W) = Z_W$ and $Y_W$ has ordinary singularities along $Z_W$. Here is the proof: The inverse image via $\pi_W$ of $Z$ is given by $Z_W\cup E_W$, where $E_W$ is the exceptional divisor of $\pi_W$. Now, we may consider the blow-up $\pi_{Z_w}:X_{Z_W}\rightarrow X_W$ of $Z_W\cup E_W$ in $X_W$, and the blow-up $\pi_Z:X_Z\rightarrow X$ of $Z$ in $X$. Note that since $E_W$ is a Cartier divisor in $X_W$ its blow-up does not produce any effect. By Corollary 7.15 in Harshorne there exists a morphism $f:X_{Z_W}\rightarrow X_Z$ such that $\pi_Z\circ f = \pi_W\circ \pi_{Z_{W}}$. Therefore, the morphism $f$ must map the exceptional divisor $E_{Z_W}$ of $\pi_{Z_W}$ onto the exceptional divisor $E_{Z}$ of $\pi_Z$. Furthermore, $f$ contracts the strict transform $\tilde{E}_W$ of $E_W$ in $X_{Z_W}$ onto $\pi_{Z}^{-1}(W)\subset E_Z$. Now, let $g:\widetilde{X}_Z\rightarrow X_Z$ be the blow-up of $\pi_{Z}^{-1}(W)$. By the universal property of the blow-up, see Proposition 7.14 Hartshorne, there exits a unique morphism $\phi:X_{Z_W}\rightarrow \widetilde{X}_Z$ such that $g\circ\phi = f$. Note that since we just blew-up smooth subvarieties both $X_{Z_W}$ and $\widetilde{X}_Z$ are smooth with Picard number $\rho(X_{Z_W}) = \rho(\widetilde{X}_Z) = \rho(X)+2$. In particular, the birational morphism $\phi:X_{Z_W}\rightarrow \widetilde{X}_Z$ can not be a divisorial contraction. Notice that $\phi$ can not be a small contraction either because otherwise $\widetilde{X}_Z$ would be singular. We conclude that $\phi$ is a bijective morphism, and since both $X_{Z_W}$ and $\widetilde{X}_Z$ are smooth $\phi$ is an isomorphism. Now, let $Y_W$ be the strict transform of $Y$ in $X_W$, and assume that $Z_W\subsetneqq Sing(Y_W)$. Therefore, the strict transform $Y_{Z_W}$ of $Y_W$ in $X_{Z_W}$ is singular, and since $g$ is just the blow-up of a smooth variety the image $(g\circ \phi)(Y_{Z_W}) = f(Y_{Z_W})\subset X_Z$ is singular as well. Note that $f(Y_{Z_W})\subset X_Z$ is nothing but the strict transform of $Y$ via $\pi_Z$, and since $Sing(Y) = Z$ and $Y$ has ordinary singularities along $Z$ the blow-up $\pi_Z$ resolves the singularities of $Y$. A contradiction. We conclude that $Sing(Y_W) = Z_W$. Finally, if the intersection $Y_{Z_W}\cap E_{Z_W}$ is not transversal then the intersection $Y_Z\cap E_Z$ is not transversal as well. But this can not happen because the singularities of $Y$ are ordinary. Therefore, $Y_W$ has ordinary singularities along $Z_W$.
