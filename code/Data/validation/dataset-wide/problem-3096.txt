The British judiciary has a very long history of independence. The government (executive branch) wouldn't be able to set quotas for transportation, in the same way they can't set quotas for prisoners. The sentencing is entirely up to the judiciary, particularly before the 20th century advent of "sentencing guidelines". Mostly, the punishment of transportation to the colonies was used as alternative to a long prison sentence, when the crime wasn't quite worthy of hanging. Generally, the idea was to get these people away from society. The colonies were not quite considered "properly civilized" and therefore little thought was given to the effects the arriving criminals would have there. 

19th Century California - There was a large influx of Chinese immigrants, whose culture has permeated into the American. The several large China-town districts in San Francisco and other towns (even New York) are a good indicator, as well as the prevalence and popularity of Chinese food in mainstream American culture. 21st Century eastern Africa - There are several nations in eastern Africa currently involved in serious trade with China, mostly around raw materials supply, such as mining. This is being done mostly by Chinese companies, bringing their own personnel. Naturally, the culture is slowly being influenced by all the people visiting, though of course it's too soon to tell how deep the sinification will be. Malaysia - There has been a huge Chinese influence in Malaysia over the last century or so. So much so, that it has (among other things) lead to the creation of Singapore, as the Malaysian federation tried to evade that influence. 

There are plenty of industrial uses for steam engines, mostly for generating electricity. Any coal-fueled power station is a steam engine, or more likely a set of them. The only big change in technology is that converting the steam's expansion energy to kinetic energy is now done using a steam turbine and not a piston engine. Since the question specifically mentions railways, I suppose the mobile/transportation uses are the intended focus. There are still some steam locomotives around, run by enthusiasts and mostly for tourists. There are some in England, India and China that I know of, and probably some others as well. For more practical uses, there are naval vessels which are steam powered. In this case, of course, they also use steam turbines rather than piston engines. Also, and I suppose this is a big change, they create the heat for the steam not by burning coal but by nuclear fission. At heart, any nuclear-powered ship is running on steam. 

There has been a huge shift in naval battle concepts during the 20th century. This is especially true of the 1960's, and the advent of missile cruisers. When ships fought with guns, there was a matter of "catching" a ship, which could escape if it was faster. Since the 1960's, ships fight with guided missiles (French Exocets then, American Harpoons now). These are incredibly fast, and can cruise well over 100 Nautical Miles, and even be guided over the horizon by air support. Since this is the case, the added 10Kts of speed are simply not a factor that will justify the fuel expenditure. If you look at patrol boats, which spend a lot of time chasing various things as part of their role, you'll find that many of them go well above 40 Kts, even as fast as 47 Kts. 

First, I think the United Nations is a barely functioning body, diplomatically. It serves many worthy causes in some of its agencies, such as the World Health Organization and the World Food Program, but for its main stated purpose it isn't much of a factor. However, the UN is sort of an arbiter of last resort for the smaller powers, because its decisions are backed by the larger powers. As for the greater powers, generally those with permanent seats on the security council, the name of the game is Mutually Assured Destruction. Once nuclear weapons became common, war between the major powers is no longer winnable, and is therefore avoided. 

Social Security is a huge portion of US federal spending ( about 20%). The Romans had no state care for the elderly, who would have lived with family. State funded healthcare (Medicare and Medicaid, as well as emergency room treatments) are another 20% of the budget, and didn't exist in Roman times. Public Works and infrastructure is about 4% of US federal government spending, but there's more money supplied by the individual states. This is probably about equivalent to the Romans, who built roads, aqueducts, public baths and more in most of the empire. Defence spending is about 25% of the US federal budget, and was a much smaller component of the Roman budget. However, I'm not sure the militaries are comparable. Obviously, the Romans didn't have to pay for the upkeep of a nuclear arsenal, submarines or an airforce, which are all incredibly expensive in terms of equipment costs. Additionally, Roman soldiers were paid partially in spoils of war, which were also a form of income for the empire. Obviously, this isn't something the US government does. 

In my understanding, Latin was never anyone's first language outside of the Italian peninsula. It was, of course, the lingua franca for intra imperial trade and officialdom, but anything local was conducted in the local languages. I think the closest modern day equivalent in modern times would be India. Each region has its own local language or dialect. However, for any wider trade across India, you would need to speak Hindi or English. Because Britain is an island, and because of the sheer distance from the remains of the empire after it withdrew from Britain, Latin was no longer useful to know, and was more or less forgotten. Naturally, there are exceptions, mostly for priests and lawyers. 

There is a usefulness in having a micro-state closely allied to your larger country, though still technically independent (like a small protectorate). These still exist to a certain extent today. The UK gets to use Jersey and the British Virgin Islands as tax havens. The Chinese have Macao and Hong-Kong special administrative regions as economically outside the main Chinese control, to their benefit. Macao (again) and Monaco exist as gambling and banking venues for the protector state for behaviours which are illegal in the country proper. The older micro-states in Europe are still fully independent, though the more modern ones (Macao, Gibraltar, even Guantanamo Bay sort of) have a fuzzier definition, but serve the same purposes. Since having these satellite micro-states is useful, they survive. 

Hebrew in general, and biblical Hebrew especially are very metaphorical languages. A well-known phrase is "כל ישראל אחים" meaning "All Israel are brothers". Essentially, the word for brother is easily and commonly used metaphorically to mean kinsman, or even more broadly. Two people in the same shelter can be said to be "brothers in their trouble". Some of these phrases, like "brothers in arms" have passed through into English as well. As an aside, in modern Hebrew, Arab people are occasionally referred to as "cousins", because the tradition is that they are children of Ishmael, son of Isaac, whereas Jews are children of Jacob, Ishmael's younger twin. This makes the two peoples cousins. 

A choice made by the people of the state, usually via the mechanism of an election or a referendum, has caused states and governements to dissolve. The first, and most potent answer is the parting of Czechoslovakia into the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic in 1993. This was done by means of an act of the elected parliament the previous year, and resulted in the dissolution of the state into two new sovereign states. The second answer is more controversial. I would argue that a major change in the methods of government may also constitute a dissolution of the state. For example Germany in the early 1930's. A democratically elected government transforms the state into a dictatorship within several years. I think it's fair to say that Germany of the Weimar Rupublic is not the Germany of the Third Reich, though both were undoubtably Germany. 

Different languages have different sounds that flow easily in that language. Names from another language are bound to be slightly mis-pronounced, especially if the new language doesn't have the original sounds easily available. A great example of this is Chinese (Mandarin), which has its set of syllables, and isn't built to handle new ones. When I was in China, my name was rendered as Kaimei. Most native Chinese speakers simply couldn't get their head round an R after the ka sound. This in addition to the troubles with Rs and Ls. In this case, you could say that the Chinese version of Carmi is Kaimei, but I wouldn't say that I took on a Chinese name. In a similar fashion, if an ancient Hebrew man called Yokhanan had to do business with the Greeks or Romans, they would end up calling him Yohan, which is a set of sounds more familiar to their ears. In the same way, a Roman called Yohan (probably Iohan in latin) were to try doing business in England, he'd end up a Jon. This is exactly we we have John the Baptist, whose Hebrew name is originally Yokhanan. My point is that people didn't necessarily convert their names, they just ended up being called something that sounded familiar to the speakers of the host language.
