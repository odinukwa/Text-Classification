As others have noted, the gravitational pull of other planets, notably Venus, would prevent this planet from always remaining exactly on the opposite side of the sun. I haven't done the calculations, so I'm not sure if it would deviate ENOUGH to actually be visible from our Earth. But regardless, I suppose, for the sake of the question let's assume not. Counter-Earth is always behind the Sun or so close to the Sun that it is invisible. Once people discovered gravity and starting figuring out orbital mechanics, they would figure out that there must be another planet of this mass and in this orbit. Neptune was discovered this was in 1846, and it's effects are much smaller and more difficult to observe than Counter-Earth's would be. So absolute latest is early 1800s. I would have said earliest is when Newton formulated theory of gravity, 1687. (I'm not sure on what basis others have said 1500s. Maybe they're making different assumptions or maybe they know something about the history of astronomy that I don't.) But I'd say that -- going by the assumption that it is never visible from Earth and we can only deduce its existence from gravitational effects -- it would have been discovered sometime in the 1700s. As to what difference it makes to history ... hard to say. How would Earth history be different if Mars or Venus did not exist? This depends a lot on how "fragile" you think history is. Think of all those time travel stories. If someone went back in time and changed one little thing, would the effects quickly peter out, lost in the rounding errors, and history proceeds as before? Or would that one small change create larger and larger ripples until history was totally different? In this case, if someone said, "Hey, I've proven that there is this Counter-Earth on the other side of the Sun", would people basically say, "Wow, how interesting", and go on with their lives as before? Or would it lead one person to spend a night standing on a hill staring at the sky, and while he's standing there he catches cold and dies, and he was the person who would have made some crucial scientific discovery, and so, etc. Or, would someone wonder how life on Counter-Earth might be the same or different from life on Earth, and this leads him to philosophize about why history happens the way it does, and he proposes some ground-breaking new theory that changes how we look at the world, etc. You say this world is lifeless, so there would be no issue of people communicating with the (non-existent) inhabitants. So aside from the philosophical implications, and possible "butterfly effect" sort of incidental implications, there would be no direct effect until space travel was developed to the point where people could travel there. 

So in the process of creating my world, I came across a question that I could not find the answer to. When do you decide that a nation is a City-State, a Kingdom, or an Empire? I am going to start by saying that any small settlement or town that is not at least a "City-State" (ie, with an army and a local government of some kind) are not relevant to this question. Throughout history not all City-States had Kings, but some did. Some Kingdoms only had a single city in them, and some Empires were only a single Kingdom. So where do you draw these lines? Are these definitions arbitrary? What makes a Kingdom a Kingdom and not a City-State or an Empire? etc. 

Oxygen a surprisingly innocent but effective choice. All you got to do is increase the ratio percentage in the atmosphere enough, that starting a fire causes a global fireball. If that doesn't kill everyone, the environmental consequences should finish them off. 

An interesting fact about having a technology edge in war is that sooner or latter the other side is going to figure out how your toys work and use them against you. If humanity is going to win, it going to be victory based in wit, understanding the enemy and using there own strength against them. You likely want a trickster hero and a nice opening battle where the alien's curb stomp a huge human army... you know to set tone and show how one sided a straight up fight with them would be. I also be tempted to give the alien's background some thought, maybe they have limited supplies and support because something bad happened to them (crashed ship maybe?), perhaps there even a way the story might end well for both factions as well. 

This is a classic problem for libertarians. Obvious possibilities are: One: Tolls. A private company builds the roads and runs them for profit. This would work fine for long-distance roads, like U.S. interstate highways. It would likely be impractical for local roads where it has to be possible to get on and off just about anywhere: the expense of building and staffing a toll booth every ten feet would likely be wildly impractical. Maybe in a high-tech society you could have electronic sensors that automatically detect when a car enters the road and then you automatically send the driver a monthly bill, but even at that, the system of sensors is probably expensive to maintain. There's also the problem: Most homes, businesses, etc have just one road leading to them. I mean there may be many possible routes to get there, but at the end there is usually just one road in front of that person's house. This creates an extreme monopoly problem: What happens if the company that owns the road in front of your house decides to increase the toll to something outrageous? Can they trap you in your house until you pay up or starve to death? Two: Advertising. The owner of the road charges a fee to let advertisers put up billboards or the like along the road. This is, of course, how radio and many web sites are funded. Same monopoly problem. Three: Business ancillary service. Businesses pay for roads, as an ancillary service. Just like many businesses provide rest rooms, water fountains, etc, as a convenience to their customers. Or like trade groups fund standards organizations. Etc. Businesses might form an association to pay for the local roads in town. They have an incentive to provide decent roads so customers can drive to the business. There is a free rider problem: What if some companies refuse to contribute? In some cases you could say, Tough on you then, we won't build a road to your store. But if there's a street with 100 stores and 2 or 3 refuse to contribute to maintain the street, the others can't just not maintain the street in front of those stores. Customers still have to drive over that part of the street to get to others. There are stores across the street and right next to them. Etc. Still, the same problem exists with other community services. What if one company refuses to contribute to a standards organization? The others grumble and ignore the problem. If the big boys contribute, the system can work, and the big boys know that if they don't contribute, the whole thing collapses. Four: Streets are maintained as a public service by non-profit organizations, using voluntary contributions. Just like many people contribute to charities that help the poor. Big free rider problem. But lots of people donate substantial sums to charity nevertheless, so it could work. Possible catch: People will donate to charity because they know the money is going to help people who can't provide for themselves. (Unless the charity is a scam or is badly managed, but whatever.) But in the case of a road system, the beneficiaries will often be as rich or richer than the donors. Would people be less willing to donate under those circumstances? Maybe the rich would just be expected to pay more. Which leads to ... Five: Rich people pay for roads as a public service, perhaps out of a feeling of obligation, of "giving back" to the community that made them rich, or for the prestige of having their name on it. Much like in the 1800s and 1900s rich people paid for parks and libraries. Again, there's a free rider problem, but the rich patron doesn't care. He WANTS free riders. He puts big signs up that say, "Fred Smith Highway", and is pleased that every time someone uses the road they know he paid for it. Or he just has the personal satisfaction of saying, Yes, I make this town possible by providing all the roads. I'd add that if a society really faced this issue, it's likely that SOMEONE would come up with a creative and practical solution. When radio was first invented, lots of people said that it would obviously have to be run by the government, because there was no way to even know who was listening. How could you charge people to listen to your radio station? How could anyone possibly make a profit from a radio station, when there was no way to bill your customers? But then someone thought of funding it entirely through advertising. Today that seems simple and obvious, but at the time it was a radical idea. Not that advertising didn't exist before: newspapers and magazines routinely carried advertising. But no one thought of paying for something ONLY through advertising. 

Once you can play around with a human's genetic makeup to great enough degree, it start to effect the society and can potentially causes all sort's of social strife. Basically if you make your kid stronger, tougher and smarter than the other guys kid, your kid has a inherent advantage and is more likely to be successful. And doing all these improvement likely costs a lot of money... Which means the gap between the rich and poor can deepen with every generation. Any society that reached this point with it's science will have to deal with this problem and the fact there will always be someone who want every genetic advantage they can get for there kids... legal or otherwise. 

Looking at it historically, I'm hard pressed to think of examples where a conquered people have accepted the conqueror's religion like you describe. I can think of x cases: 

We have a real-life analogy for this: The fall of Rome. People lost the ability to build things like the Romans had built, but they could see the decaying artifacts all around them. Monks preserved the old knowledge until people were able to rebuild the economic base to use it again. The result was that people had great respect for the abilities of the ancient Romans for centuries afterward. Even after they surpassed the Romans they still seemed to have an exagerrated respect for them. But no one seems to have thought their technology was magic or incomprehensible. There was a very sensible attitude of, "We need to study these ancient books and learn to reproduce what they did, and figure out how they were able to do things that we can't." Enclaves could maintain some technology. Like, I think a small group could build a hydroelectric generator to produce electricity, make light bulbs and other simple electrical devices, and maintain a 19th century technology. But some things require a huge technological base. I have a hard time imagining a few dozen or a few hundred people getting together, reading old books, and building a nuclear power plant or a microchip manufacturing plant. Some things just require too many specialists with diverse knowledge, and too many components that are presently made by different people all over the world. Clearly something like "building a cell phone network" requires the involvement of very large numbers of people over a large area. Even if you they are able to build the phones and towers themselves, who's going to build and maintain all these towers, and all the lines to connect them? Some technology could be kept running but would not be replaceable when it broke down. Like if someone did make a small electric generator, he could plug in a computer and use it, but once that computer broke, he'd be unlikely to be able to repair it. Like the old Roman roads and bridges, they could be used until they wore out or collapsed. Or like the Colliseum ended up being used as a zoo and finally a garbage dump. As people rebuilt, progress from medieval technology to modern technology would be much faster than it was the first time, because they don't have to reinvent everything. They have the old records to give them a shortcut. 

So I’m currently working on a fantasy story that features dimension hoping as a major setting element with infrequent jumps causing ideas to sometimes travel between worlds. Anyway the idea in question is Christianity, but it’s Pre Reformation Christianity (So Catholic) that’s been left to stew in a world with no strong central authority and a less than dominate position compared to other religions. What kind of details do I need to be aware of in Pre Reformation Christianity that are likely mutation points in Theology? 

With the context above, why would they work together? I want them to work together, I just don't know why would they? I have not yet finalized these predators, I am looking for suggestions, or ways to modify or design them so that cooperation will work - maybe something symbiotic? 

Lets say you have developed a Utopian society. Let's say this society has in some way made a self-sustaining fully self-sufficient ecosystem. For the purpose of answering the question, let's say its a society of 1,000,000 (one million) humans living in a huge space station. You would ideally want this ecosystem to sustain itself indefinitely. How can such an ecosystem be designed to have no single-point of failure? 

That top alpha predator set up. A single human hasn't got a prayer of fighting one on one.. and that's a major issue. The question is why a creature that likely constantly hungry would pay attention to a small sack of meat that would struggle to harm it. Maybe there trick in the taming, but because the dragon is powerful, a human going to have serous issue bossing it around, and what does a dragon have to gain from working with a plentiful food source? 

I suspect there would need to be some kind of society level shake up somewhere to get things moving more than anything. I know a lot of real scientific research in medieval Europe was done in monasteries, and that's because monks had time, money and a desire to understand Gods creation. Monasteries also tended to be near water, which acted as highways of resources and ideas. I would be included to go with some kind of stable empire who's ruler decided setting up monastery like places were a good idea from a piety point of view. You've got a bit wiggle room for the time scale I think, culture is far more important. I would also avoid nomadic and small tribes as sources anyway, you need the surplus resources of a nation/ empire of some kind to allow a caste of thinkers and tinkers to develop.
