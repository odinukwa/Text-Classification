Yes. It is a fair comparison. Human nature, market behavior and principles of finance and economics have not changed much in the recorded history of mankind. For example, the principles set forth by Adam Smith in his opus The Wealth of Nations are just as relevant today as they were in 1776 when the book was published. 

In nearly every public school district in the U.S., one can observe the following pattern: There are fewer middle schools than elementary schools. And there are fewer high schools than middle schools. (And the count of students per school goes inversely as the count of schools.) But why is this the case? Is there any explanation for this based on economic principles? For example, why is the reverse not the case? Why are there not fewer elementary schools than high schools, let's say? 

They don't know for certain. It's an inexact science. They do the best they can. Alan Greenspan was known for pouring over all the economic data available for hours while mostly in the bathtub trying to make sense of what was happening in the economy. But ultimately, it came down to making an informed decision based on knowledge, reasoning, experience and intuition. Policy objectives (which are quasi-political) can also come into play as sometimes desired results can compete. The classic example of this is economic growth vs. inflation. Critics of government monopolized central banks argue that it is impossible for any single individual or group of policy makers to choose rates correctly and overnight interbank lending rates should be allowed to float freely and be determined by the market vis-a-vis supply-demand equilibrium. Hence the popularity of LIBOR and to a lessor extent EURIBOR as these are closer to market pricing than, say, the Fed Funds Rate. However, these are still only averages of central bank policy decision and, therefore, are not purely market-driven. 

Convenience premium. The market prices in a premium for convenience. This explains why hot dogs cost more inside the ballpark than at the convenience store outside the ballpark. And why convenience store goods cost more than those sold at the supermarket. Put another way: Part of the cost of an item is not just the cost of materials and labor to get it there, but there is also a cost of availability. In other words, when you don't purchase the gas on the highway, the cost of it being available there is still present. Which you pay when you buy. Note: This answer agrees with the price elasticity explanation given by @Ubiquitous but avoids the price elasticity concept in favor of the perhaps more lay concept of convenience premium. 

This is the very standard question on Instrumental Variables of Single-Equation Linear models. Given the primitives of your question, the only endogenous variable is exercise. In order to answer this particular question, you need an exogeous variable, z, that satisfies two conditions: 

Before moving on, a remark. By structural model I mean, following Wooldridge and Goldberger convention, the postulated model. That is, the model that states the causal relationship between health and your covariates. This is a key difference and a disagreement with previous answers. Now, back at the problem at hand, condition 2 is what in the simultaneous-equations literature call the reduced form equation, which is nothing but a linear projection of the endogenous onto all exogenous variables, including z. Now, plug the reduced form into your postulated model and you'll get $$ health=\alpha_0 + \alpha_1 age + \alpha_2 weight + \alpha_3 height + \alpha_4 male + \alpha_5 work + \delta z + \nu $$ where $\alpha_i = b_i + b_6\beta_i,\: \forall i \in \{1,\dots,5\}$, $\delta=b_6\phi$ and $\nu = u+b_6\varepsilon_{exercise}$. By the definition of linear projection, $\nu$ is uncorrelated with all explanatory variables and thus OLS of this last equation will produce consistent estimates for $\alpha_i$ and $\delta$, not the underlying $b_i$ in the true model. Identification requires a bit of manipulation in matrix form but essentially it reduces to the so-called rank condition. Define $\mathbf{b}=(b_0,\dots,b_6)'$ and $\mathbf{x}=(1, age, \dots, exercise)'$ so that your structural model is $health=\mathbf{x}'\mathbf{b}+u$. Now define $\mathbf{z}\equiv(1,age,\dots,work,z)'$. By condition 1 (cov(z,u)=0 so that E(z,u)=0), $$ \mathbb{E}(\mathbf{z}u)=0 $$ If you multiply bot sides of the structural model by $\mathbf{z}$ and take expectations you have $$ \mathbb{E}(\mathbf{z}\mathbf{x}')\mathbf{b}=\mathbb{E}(\mathbf{z}y) $$ Rank condition states that $\mathbb{E}(\mathbf{z}\mathbf{x}')$ is full column rank. In this particular example and given conditions on z this is equivalent to $rank(\mathbb{E}(\mathbf{z}\mathbf{x}')=6$. Therefore we have 6 equations in 6 unknowns. Hence there exists a unique solution for the system i.e. $\mathbf{b}$ is identified and equals to $[\mathbb{E}(\mathbf{z}\mathbf{x}')]^{-1}\mathbb{E}(\mathbf{z}y)$, as desired. Remarks: Condition 1 is useful to get the moment condition but the reduced form model with $\phi$ is crucial for the rank condition. Both conditions are usual. At this point it should be clear why do we need this. In the one hand, without z OLS estimator of the true model will produce inconsisten estimators not only for $b_6$ but for all $b_i$. In the other hand (and somewhat related), our parameters are uniquely identifies so we are certain that we are estimating the true causal relationship as stated in our true model. In regard to testing, condition 2 (z and exercise are partially correlated) can be tested directly and you should always report that step contrary to the comment in a previous answer. There is a huge literature in relation to this step, specially the weak-instrument literature. Second condition cannot be directly tested nonetheless. Sometimes you might invoke economic theory to justify or provide alternative hypotheses thats support the use of z. 

Diclaimer: This is not a homework question. Every word of it was written originally by me. Hypothetical Scenario Alice is shopping for groceries and thinks the current price of bananas at 0.79/lb is a little too high for her budget. Alice calls Bob, her local legislator, and asks Bob to sponsor a bill that regulates the price of bananas to cost no more than $0.50/lb in the grocery store so Alice can afford to buy them. Bob thinks this is a great idea because it will help more people (especially the poor and those on a fixed income) afford to buy more bananas â€” a very nutritious food. Question Is this bill to regulate the price of bananas really a good idea? What would be the impact of such a law if it were to pass? 

If short term rates are positive and long term rates are negative then short term rates must be higher than long term rates. Therefore, the yield curve will be considered inverted by definition. Remember, central banks set the interbank overnight lending rate as a matter of policy. In the U.S., this is called the Federal Reserve Funds Rate. This is the shortest possible maturity. So this is the leftmost point on the yield curve. By contrast, supply-demand equilibrium (i.e., the market) sets long-term bond prices. And, as we know, bond prices are inversely correlated to their yields. So when the market demand increases for long term bonds, their prices rise and their yields fall. 

There is also this concept of creative destruction. Which basically means that old less productive technologies must die in order to free up resources to be made available to new, more productive technologies. It's analogous to pruning. But it occurs naturally in a free market economy and does not require management or government intervention. Protectionism impedes the natural and beneficial process of creative destruction. 

Non-linear adaptive human behavior, uncertainty and governmental decentralization of control (i.e., democracy) are the main reasons I believe control theory has not become a more common tool for policy makers. Economics is simply not an exact science. Whereas engineering is more so. So control theory is more useful in the engineering discipline. 

Let's define $P^*$ the price of market equilibrium, $Q_D$ as the quantity demanded and $E_D$ as price elasticity of demand. Then: $$ {slope} = \frac{rise}{run} = \frac{\Delta P}{\Delta Q_D} $$ And in mathematical terms, the verbal description of the PED reduces to: $$ E_D = \frac{\frac{\Delta Q_D}{Q_D} \cdot 100}{\frac{\Delta P}{P^*} \cdot 100} $$ $$ E_D = \frac{P^*}{Q_D} \cdot \frac{\Delta Q_D} {\Delta P} $$ $$ E_D = \frac{P^*}{Q_D} \cdot \frac{1}{slope} $$ Edit Constructive comments have been incorporated into this answer.
