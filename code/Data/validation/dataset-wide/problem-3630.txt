If strength is your primary goal, try to make some or most of your running speed training. For instance, look at an Olympic distance runner versus an Olympic sprinter. Nutrition is important, but the most important thing is not to hurt yourself. Start with whatever weight you can handle, and "slowly" (at a comfortable pace) increase it. I am not a big fan of muscle splits. You can do them, but I would mix in some full body lifts as well. Deadlifts and squats for instance. The long answer is that it ultimately depends on being more specific on your training goals. If you want to increase your bench press, I would do it twice per week, backing off to once only if I started feeling pain somewhere. I would do the same with pull-ups. If you have specific movements at which you want to be better, do them more than once per week. I would be very careful with deadlifting more than once per week though unless you are very experienced. 

About 6 weeks ago, I was doing heavy cleans from the blocks. On the last, my knee lined up with my elbow and forearm, catching the weight and forcing my hand to bend backward. I can use it day to day, but when trying out lifting again a couple of weeks later my finger tips went numb and stayed that way. I have taken another couple of weeks off after 2 weeks back at the gym. Only the end of my thumb still feels some numbness. When I catch something or turn it enough the pain goes through the bottom of my palm through the webbing between my thumb and forefinger in a semicircle. Any ideas to strengthen or reduce my time away from lifting? 

Will my psoas muscles stop hurting after using an exercise ball for a chair for a while? I've been using the exercise ball as a chair for about a week now 4 hours a day at work, and it seems that the muscle it effects the most is my psoas muscles. This is mostly due to the fact that I'm used to slumping in my chair for 8 or 9 hours a day, and using the exercise ball I'm having to make a concentrated effort to sit up straight. How long will it take for this to stop being so painful, and is it possible that I'm overdoing it with 4 hours a day? 

Insulin is absolutely proven to be a major contributor in the production of new fat cells. Fructose, sucrose, and glucose all rapidly increase your blood sugar, causing an equal or greater insulin reaction as well. Weight and weight loss still essentially boil down to calories, though. If you take in 1200 calories a day in almost nothing but carbohydrates, and you expend 2200 calories a day, you can lose fat, and you will lose 2 pounds a week using this method. Is it healthy? No. Can it be done? Sure. Since your body needs more energy than is provided by 1200 calories, the carbohydrates are burned first, and as your blood sugar decreases, your body stops producing insulin, and then the excess required energy is taken from the body's fat supply. Trust me, I actually tried this 1200 calories of carbs a day one time to see it's effect, and I lost quite a bit of weight. Eventually, I did reach a plateau though that could not be broken. Unfortunately, excess carbohydrate intake also causes you to be hungry pretty much all the time. I was eating four meals a day and was still pretty hungry in between when I was doing this. Weight loss this way is very slow and ineffective, difficult to maintain, and very bad for your body. Reducing your carbohydrate intake makes it significantly easier to maintain a diet, a healthy lifestyle, and lose weight. 

I agree with just about everything Eric said, especially Starting Strength and Stronglifts 5x5. Another I would consider is the Wendler's 5/3/1 program. Which ever you decide, stick with it for at least 6 months. A year would be better. You will see great results. I slightly disagree with the cardio. My personal opinion is to do what is commonly referred to as "Finishers". This means sprint workouts that may last as little as 8 to 15 minutes. Jump on a stationary bike and do 30 seconds of sprinting hard, followed by a minute or so of rest. This can be done with running, biking, or even push-ups, other bodyweight excercises, etc. Tabata exercises are great too. Pick a movement (pushups, situps, squats, lunges, kettle bell swings, burpees, etc.), work for 20 seconds and rest for 10 seconds, repeat for 8 sets (4 minutes). If you're feeling froggy, back it up with another one with a different movement, and if you are super motivated try a third movement, but I would rest 1 to 2 minutes between movements. As for the diet coke, it won't help, but it probably won't hurt too much. Just make sure it doesn't cut into your water intake. Stay hydrated. Hope that helps. Just getting moving, and making the commitment is the hardest part. 

I like pull-ups, easily my favorite exercise and I do a lot of them whenever I get the chance. I'm quite familiar with form, do them very strict (elbow lock-out, chin way over bar etc) and vary my grip often. Still, I'd like to add some more peak power to the movement and I'm not sure how. My eventual goal is to progress to a muscle-up, but the bar in my apartment is too close to the ceiling for me to practice this. :) I guess learning to do a kipping pull-up would be a good idea, but as long as I remember I've been focusing on maintaining absolute control and tension, and a kipping pull-up is completely opposite all that. If kipping pull-ups are the answer, I'd appreciate a link to some good resources on learning to do them. While my goal is more speed-strength in general, I'd be even happier if the suggestions have carry-over to muscle-ups. Currently, I can do about 10-12 pulls without much problem. I tend to train by "greasing the groove" and doing sets of 4-6, but I also travel a lot and don't have a bar everywhere, so this isn't daily or anything. I'm more interested in exercise suggestions than full programs. Also, I rock-climb, so any carry-over is welcome (but I am looking for power outside the context of rock-climbing, too). 

Bodybuilding.com also suggests swinging dumbbell calf raises, where you do a single leg calf raise while swinging a dumbbell around randomly. 

From what you're describing, it sounds like a "Jump Through". A Jump Through involves starting in the Downward Dog position and pivoting your body on your shoulders until you reach the Staff position. Doing this transition in reverse is called a Jump Back. Here's a YouTube video that has a pretty nice example of both transitions. So, in order to perform this transition: 

You'll need a good sense of balance and decent strength in your forearms. Just keep trying and practicing and you'll eventually get it down. 

These exercises are meant to be a low-stress muscle building technique to prevent tearing or injuring the muscles or tendons in their weakened state. You should not do any abdominal exercises until after your stitches have been removed and your scars are healed if you had a cesarean section. Your shortened description of the exercise would be correct. 

Most of the time, cramps come from electrolyte imbalance, and can be treated drinking more water and/or taking in more potassium, sodium, calcium, and/or magnesium. From your examples of cramps, I have always had the second type of cramping you mention, and no diet or nutrition changes have ever effected it in any way. Hyperthyroidism is also a known cause for muscle cramps. Hyperthyroidism can be caused by a lack of iodine in the diet. Using iodized salt can help regulate the amount of iodine in your diet as well. 

How far along in the program are you? I suggest waiting about a month and re-evaluating. Novices can increase the weight quite fast on SS (I know I did) and very soon you won't be able to recover in time, thus hurting your goals. Pushing yourself too hard might result in more downtime down the road - focus on adding weight to the three exercises you do. It should be ok, though, to up the deadlifts to twice a week (so pull-ups just once). You'll probably manage this for a good while, and once you can no longer keep up, hopefully you'll be able to replace one day with power cleans. 

It goes on to recommend doing the barbell version ("as the weight of history and precedent demands"), though. 

Visualization can be an important part of doing an exercise right. I recently came upon a bit of advice on another website and I could immediately feel an improvement in my form (despite having done probably thousands of pullups before). My question is: do you know any good visualizations for doing pullups? For the record, the sentence which inspired this: During this initial movement, pretend that you are squeezing a pencil between your shoulder blades and do not let the pencil drop during any phase of the pull-up. 

Since I've started running I've noticed that my appetite has gone up incredibly.I need to know how much I can eat to stave off the hunger while staying under my caloric burn. Is there a way to calculate how many calories you burn during interval running (run 2 minutes walk 3 minutes, etc)? I've worked very hard to drop a significant amount of weight, and while being hungry is unpleasant, I don't want to overeat and start putting the weight back on for sure. Additionally, I still have a few pounds left to lose. 

The only thing that this workout seems to be missing is a biceps and calves. Your calves can be worked out by sitting on the ball with your feet flat on the ground, knees bent ad at a 90 degree angle, and then rocking up on your toes. This will roll the ball forward, add weight and instability to your calves, requiring you to balance. For biceps, you're going to really need to get a set of dumbbells or do some non-exercise ball related exercise. 

There is no scientific evidence that these gels work. From a site reviewing a Hoodia weight loss gel: 

Grip hands behind back. If flexibility prevents this, grip a stick or something to make up the difference. Stick out your chest and raise your arms away from your body using your shoulders. 

I started indoor rock-climbing a few months ago, renting equipment from wherever I was climbing at. I've decided to take it a bit more seriously and invest in some equipment, and the first step are shoes. However, there's quite a lot to choose from and I'm not sure how to pick - the only difference I really notice is how they lace-up. What should I look for in a good shoe? To reiterate, I'm a beginner and I intend to climb just indoor (for the foreseeable future). 

I'm not sure which of the books is better. I think I managed to grab more useful information from the first, but the second is better written and should probably be your first choice. Now, neither of the two is an "exercise bible", but they do provide more than enough information to train yourself without weights. 

You could try the Cooper test, which is basically "run at a steady pace for 12 minutes and look at the table". I've always found it sufficient for my purposes (to see how much I improved in a given time period). 

First of all, 20 pullups is quite a feat, good job! I assume you are doing them with proper form: chin over bar on top, elbows locked and body still at the bottom. If you are doing something else, or eg. kipping pullups (basically, using your momentum in any way), the first thing you should do is transition to strict form pullups. Doing 50 pullups is as much a matter of endurance as it is of strength. Personally, I've had a lot of good results doing weighted pullups, which build up strength. This will allow you to literally "fly" once the weight is off. What you want to do is to use a dip-belt and hang progressively bigger weights on it. You could also use a backpack (and fill it with eg. bags of sand) but it tends to hang awkwardly and it messes up your center of mass; because of this it also limits the amount of weight you can add. Using a dip belt takes care of all this. You should start low, a few kilograms added only (so as not to stress your joints too much). You should be able to add about 2 or 2.5 kgs every week. You can combine weighted pullups with any sort of program. As for the program itself, I've again had a lot of luck doing "ladders". Basically, do 1, then 2, then 3 up to as much as you can, and then all the way back. Add a final "max effort" series at the end. If the last series is close or above your maximum, increase the max next time. The idea is to completely slaughter yourself. Doing ladders is beneficial because it will help with both strength (low reps, especially on the way back) and endurance (the high reps). All that said, though, I don't think I know anyone who can do 50 strict form pullups, so this is all purely academic. Also, when you say you can do over a hundred with pauses, is this with hanging all the time or with letting go of the bar? If you are hanging through all this, then you are way beyond me and this advice might not apply to you at all. === Bonus: Most people will find chin-ups easiest (with mixed grip in the middle and pullups the hardest) but this depends on how well some specific muscles are developed and even your technique. They all target slightly different muscle groups, though, so for the best overall results you should probably try to use all grips (and even vary your grip width). If you must focus on one, the most popular choice are pullups. 

If you continue to dance against your doctor's advice, then you can expect to have more problems than you have now. The only way to prevent further injury to an already injured ligament is to rest it for enough of a period of time to fully heal. No amount of stretching or warming up first will prevent further or more permanent damage to an already injured ligament. Stop using it until your doctor says otherwise. 

Heavy lifting can cause a muscle-binding effect and limit your flexibility, making it difficult to get into correct positions for shooting or effect your stability. The sports aren't specifically at odds, but you do want to make sure that you don't work to the point of limiting your mobility with heavy lifting. I know a guy who could not shoot for this very reason, his shoulders had limited range of motion due to excessive exercise (at work, not in a gym) and he had to cut way back on what he was doing at work so he could get back full mobility in his shoulders. It takes a lot of work and a long time to get there, and you should see early warnings far before you get to that point. Just make sure that all of your exercises, especially in the shoulders and arms, are exercising your full range of motion, and cut back if you notice a decrease in that range. Specifically, with what you're describing, along with the exercises for stability, I would say that you're in no danger of this becoming a problem. I'm primarily stating that it is possible, without appropriate care to maintain balance and full range of motion. 

It's important to note that your weight varies daily based on all sorts of factors, most notably water retention (can account for a significant weight difference - we are mostly water after all). It is also important to weight yourself at the same time each day, preferably in the morning. Still, some variance will happen so it might be a good idea to weight yourself daily but plot the eg. 7-day average and consider that your "real" weight. If you are doing everything right, it should be going down, even if some days are higher than others. Finally, depending on your weight lifting program, you will start putting on muscle mass, which weights more than fat (if you consider the same volume), but depending on how much fat you need to "shift", this effect can take a while to be noticeable. 

Do you have a pull-up bar or access to one (ie. in a park or a playground; you can hang off most things)? If not, you can invest in one of those doorframe pull-up bars - they cost about 20-30 dollars usually, which is not prohibitively expensive. If you do decide to head out to a playground, look for a place where you can do dips (you'll need two parallel bars at shoulder width and hip-height, approximately). The reason I suggest these is that you need to do these "hard", compound exercises if you want to gain muscle; push-ups will only get you so far (and that's not very far indeed). It is also relatively easy to progressively load them further if required - you can use a backpack and fill it with weight. These two exercises will work most of your upper-body and require minimal equipment. If you are concerned your abs aren't getting worked out, you can also invest in an ab-wheel, which costs about 10-20 bucks usually and is also a very good tool. For bodyweight exercises in general, the way to make the exercise more challenging is to decrease the leverage you have - eg. for pushups you can raise your legs on something, which'll stress your shoulders some more (and in general, you'll be lifting a higher weight) or you can try to push your arms more forward (ie. don't keep them bellow your shoulders but further up towards - or even beyond - your head), this will work your abs and lower back muscles more and is harder. Still, to answer your actual question, if you are determined to "make" your own weights, the best solution is probably bags filled with sand. Take some of those small bags which you use to pack stuff in the fridge, fill them with eg. 1 kg of sand (don't forget to double or triple wrap them, they can break and sand everywhere is not comfortable). You can then put as many as you need in a backpack or a bigger bag/container and easily calibrate the weight you need. Note that it's actually non-trivial to figure out how to add weight to bodyweight exercises (and doing something intended for dumbbells with homemade weights, you'll outgrow fairly quickly). If at all possible, I would try to assure access to at least a pull-up bar and exercise with it.
