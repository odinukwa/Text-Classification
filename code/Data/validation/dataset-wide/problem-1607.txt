The language to note is "on reasonable grounds". IANAL, however I take this to mean that the police must have reason to believe that the noice on your hard drive is encrypted information connected to their "proper performance"; and that they must be able to demonstrate that reason. In short it's insufficient for the police to say "Give me the key to this encrypted information". It's insufficient for them to say "Give me the key to this encrypted information because I believe it to be connected to the case I am working on". They need to be able to say "Give me the key to this encrypted information because I believe it to be connected to the case I am working on. And I believe this because of ...". I do not know what standards govern the things that go into the dots. If they are able to do the above the sections contested by DJClayworth and Konrad Rudolph comes into play meaning that if you can show that you do not have the keys; for example if you can show that the "encrypted data" is in fact a recording of background astronomical noise, which you keep as a source of entrophy, you would not be liable to hand over the key because you are not in possesion of such a key. - For this you need to have sufficient evidence to cast doubt on the issue of you having the key, and for the police not to have evidence that you have to key. 

Additionally, she claims that the language does contain a (vulgar) word for the vagina, and that technical words for the vagina exist. 

This Youtube video of the History Channel documentary Ancient Aliens, Season 3 Episode 9 makes the claim that the ancient Indian city of Mohenjo-Daro was destroyed by a nuclear weapon, and that the ancient Indians recorded this in the Mahabharata as the Brahmastra. There also exist many "ancient alien conspiracy" websites on the Internet making similar claims. They base this claim on two unsourced reasons (video starting with the claim): 1: That there was increased levels of radioactivity above the background level found at Mohenjo-Daro. 2: That there was vitrification of the soil found at the same place. Are there any sources to prove any of the previous claims, especially that the increased radioactivity matched the isotopic signatures of atomic weapons? Is this fringe historical claim believable? 

However, this claim is unsourced, and this The Straight Dope article claims that there is no proof that this theory is correct. 

This means that homeopathy has been shown to be no different from a placebo (i.e. a negative control treatment). This implies that the only effects generated by the homeopathic "treatment" are due to the placebo, and not the "treatment" itself. As mentioned in the comments, from a chemical viewpoint, any dilution above 12C contains such a low dilution that no molecules of the original chemical remain in the supposed "medicine", and therefore there is no scientific basis for homeopathy being a plausible remedy. IMO, the best counter to any homeopath is that tap water is an unimaginably strong homeopathic remedy of literally everything possible, including dinosaurs. 

This is an expansion to the answer given by DJClayworth above, since he quotes a less than relevant part of the law. The passage given by DJClayworth describes an afirmative defence against request under section 49 of the law quoted. Section 49 is at $URL$ . Section 49 states, among other things; 

The answer would be No. - Assuming that the number of CPU's produced follows also follows a power law. The reason; If CPU's are produced by year . And if the number of transistors on CPU number where given by . Then the number of transistors on the CPU produced at the end of year would be . - So we would expect a super exponetial growth. While the points indicated by vartec might cast doubts on the question of wether CPU production is still growing exponentially, we should look at the time when the law was formulated. 

As commenters noted, several spanish people commented on the clip, none claimed that the translation was false. The original buzzfeed article was in spanish. Google translate of the above seems to agree with the translation. That said, even the English translation doesn't show the judges evaluating the girl based on her (lack of) faith. The statements that comes closes are more in the vein of "You are not a good enough singer today, and as long as you don't believe in god you will never be good enough." 

Since they have not successfully printed a horn containing recombinant rhino keratin, the third point is no longer relevant. Additionally, the image presented has nothing to do with Pembient. The photograph was of a press event in January 2014 showcasing non-3D printed rhino horns seized by the Thai customs department. The original photo was taken by Apichart Weerawong from AP, and there are photographs from Xinhua and Royal Thai Customs which covered the same press release event, which all show the same customs officer carrying the same rhino horn. 

I have not heard of such a system before, and from the viewpoint of a molecular biologist, this seems rather implausible, considering that molecular techniques such as Gibson assembly and site-directed mutagenesis, which would certainly be familiar and accessible to someone who orders DNA can be used to synthesise the sequence. Furthermore, whole genome synthesis is extremely inefficient, and it would not make much sense to put the anthrax genome on a watch list, considering Mycoplasma laboratorium took several years to synthesise, and has slightly over 10% of the length of the anthrax genome. Is there any evidence that commercial DNA synthesis labs maintain such a watch list? 

It doesn't appear that a lot of research has been done on this topic, but the research that has been conducted seems fairly clear. The Wikipedia article on lead-glass safety contains a brief description of the safety aspects. Going just a little deeper, I found two abstracts. One deals with short term use, the other with long term storage. As the article you linked mentions, long term storage of acidic or alcoholic beverages is not recommended. This Lancet abstract describes an experiment which found significant increases in lead concentration long term storage. Concentrations rose from 79 ug/L initially to 3817 ug/L after four months, and up to 21,530 ug/L after "a long time." For comparison, a typical diet will contain around 70-80 ug of lead a day. However, short term use of lead-glass containers showed relatively small amounts of lead-leaching. According to this PubMed abstract, under "conditions that are likely to occur to a consumer" the worst case lead leaching amounted to only 14.5 ug in a 350 mL (12 fl. oz.) soda or about 41 ug/L. The researchers concluded that the lead increase would not significantly affect health. On the other hand, the US CDC "Action Level" for lead in water is 15 parts per billion, or about 15 ug/L. While the soda case (worst case) from the PubMed study exceeds this level, one presumes that such consuption is not a regular occurrence. Regular use of a lead-glass beverage container would probably be contraindicated. 

Microsoft claims in their Windows 10 press release that drawing diagrams leads to 36% higher scores when solving science problems. 

Due to the difficulty of performing research on this topic, all the sources cited in this answer derive from anti-government sources, as the extent of censorship in China makes it very difficult, if not impossible, to obtain information from official sources. While it is impossible to prove that nobody executed during the 1989 Tiananmen protests had bullet fees charged to their relatives, it is unlikely that any such cases existed in a verifiable manner, due to there being no mention of incidents in 1989 from multiple anti-governmental secondary sources. If such a case existed, it would reasonably be widely communicated as another example of governmental brutality. That being said, however, the bullet fee practices of the Chinese government have been well documented by various sources, most cases of which occurred during the Cultural Revolution period. For example, this article from the Hong Kong based Epoch Times cites a number of cases where a bullet fee was charged to relatives, none of which occurred in the vicinity of the 1989 protests. The tone of this article clearly shows that the writer is anti-government, and therefore is unlikely to omit cases of bullet fees being charged during the 1989 protests that were known to him.
