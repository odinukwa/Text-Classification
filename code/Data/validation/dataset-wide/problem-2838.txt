We all use words to communicate, hopefully with a standard "unpacking" from symbols to meaning. However words should not be used as a restriction of what can or cannot exist in the mind. Awareness to me, is what your body, sense organs know from your own viewpoint. Consciousness allows an input of that awareness in addition to other people's awareness. If you made a game where a monster made decisions based upon his/her own threat system, it would be acting according to its own awareness. However when it considers the threat system of its own threats, it may make decisions otherwise. In other words, it may have a chance of doubting its own awareness in favor of another awareness, or in the case of partial blindness, increase its own vision beyond what the eyes/ears etc can see. Consciousness is far more complicated than simply processing the outside world, it is a merging of multiple words into one. (Assuming the merge does not have contradictions, one is seeing beyond what one can see and know directly. And in the case of contradictions, this leads to the capacity of disagreement.) Also to note, a conscious object is formed, as a context of learning and is critical to rapid improvement. A conscious object can contain the spatial graph of many three dimensional spaces, forming a kind of invisible (non sensory) 4 dimensional space. One other thing a conscious object can do, is project one's position into a different one, allowing one to imagine what the sensory experience would be if one were to occupy that position. Eventually the conscious makes decisions in a three dimensional space, but this is a kind of quaternion map back down to three dimensions, or a complex number mapping onto a real number (in analogy). Another thing about consciousness is that it appears to allow the input of thought streams of other people (communication) into one's own (communication object) bringing about the concept of symbolism. Why would we have symbols if there wasn't another mind to receive them? Symbols appear to play a conscious role in thought generation outside one's current awareness. Also note, sometimes when we think of emotional pain, we think of social rejection, possible through a conscious view. The more we understand how the brain handles conscious problems, the more we can figure out what we call a "bad conscious" which can increase fear exponentially higher than simple awareness of a threat, aka someone else knows you are afraid at the same time you are afraid. Therefore I think that my fear, related to my awareness, is heightened by others fear, and is experienced as a different kind of thing in the mind. That is to be conscious comes with both its great strengths and menacing daemons. We can also have empathy for other people's awareness. Sentience however to me, is the ability to take in not the thoughts of another (could be wrong) but the thinking of another (could be even wronger) and is far more complicated. Instead of thoughts coming in from different people, we see thought machines instead. We see the conscious of another, that is, the threat is not person A, but person A + B + C + D if an event were to occur, social grouping up on a person for a thought. The conscious can form a social thought police. Sentience however leads to war. The terminators do not see the human's awareness, but their conscious and deem the human race incapable of the necessary brain power to form sentiance, that is the terminators calculate a cruel salvation for man-kind. Another way to think of sentiance is again by refelcting on consciousness, consciousness allows us to override our own awareness, if another's awareness takes priority, aka our pain because another needs us - because the pain for another is calculated as worse pain, we may sacrifice our selves for another. Sentience on the other hand, can override our conscious, because the solution to the conscious problem is deemed poor, it seem extremely cruel. Awareness bubbles up to conscious, and a conscious problem bubbles up to sentience. Sentience solves the moral dilemma of the conscious, but a person who has a bad "sentience" can have a whole new tier of emotional pain, that of evaluating the consciousness of a group and deeming the entire 4 dimensional space as a poor solution to a perceived larger sentient problem. Actually leaders usually must be sentient, because they seem to override people's conscious all the time, and can be seen as even more evil, yet trying to make a larger sensation work. That is they will fire you, despite your conscious of your family because the whole company is suffering. And yes there are layers beyond that, but somehow it is about how we make decisions. A general rule is that when there is more than one of something, we need description for selection, unless nature decides for us. One such other layer, which I think is a diplomatic layer, increases the mind to the point where we can see something like a world war, and realize how destructive it is. It isn't enough to say that someone was hurt (awareness of another in our conscious layer) but the way it also hurts other people, including the person hurting the other (awareness of the conscious results - sentience, we feel somehow about it. More complicated thinking) But the entire war as hurting a larger social fabric, possibly even the world itself. In other words to be diplomatic is a something more complicated than sentience. Not everyone can be diplomatic. A diplomat, might see the general problems in an organization and realize that while it makes sense to fire a man connected to his consciousness, the sentience of the company is connected to the social fabric and produces more negative problems for the company later on. However it has to be going through even more complicated processing.) I would say that the solution of the terminators was not very diplomatic to say the least. 

If god is omniscience he would know how we(he / universe) became and why. What purpose there is in live. What his 'duty' is. If he has to pray or not. All that he would know. But the thing about the idea that a god exists is that you dont want to know. If you ask yourself if god knows everything you are allready questioning religion and you cant be a true Christian (what you already stated). No one who seriously believes in god would even consider that god doesn't know everything and therefore has to believe in a god. If god would have to believe in other gods is he really a god? Since he cant be omniscience or omnipotent what basically would degrade him from being a god. At the end of the day, if there is a god and he would belive in other gods. But the only knowledge we have about him is: He is the only god there is plus omniscience and omnipotent. Then we have to come to the conclusion that he does not believe in other gods because of the 'knowledge' we have. Even when in our hypothetical he was believing in other god. 

But in the other room the other being sees the and thinks the teleportation has worked. He leaves the room and is happy to be one of the first humans to experience teleportation and continues to live the life he knows. You are still in the first room and wondering if the teleportation has already happened. Your future life is in room A and you will experience whatever the living being in room A experiences and not the other one. So if they kill you you will die. You wont have any future experiences / wake up. Scenario Teleportation ('instant kill') You are a pile of atoms that is somewhere in space and time. If someone pushes you you are still a pile of atoms in space and time. Nothing special connects the two instances of you. Only that you identify as the same person because of memories (your brain or whatever). You go to room and close your eyes, then get measured and killed in the process (or afterwards like in the first scenario) and build in room . Both instances of you (the previous one in room and the current in room ) are the same pile of atoms. The being in room B identifies as 'you' because thats what it is. Its not different then someone pushing you. You are just in an other place but still identify as you. Question Im confused. I described the same process in 2 different ways. Will wake up after teleportation? What are some other opinions on this matter? 

By our rule of inference and our axiom, we know that $$$$ is a theorem. By our rule of inference and the theorem $$$$, we know that $$$$$ is a theorem. 

In mathematics and logic, it seems that once a proof of some theorem is discovered, then it is taken to be "absolute truth" within the axiomatic system from which it was derived. My question is: are we fully justified in asserting this? For example, suppose we were to assume that the string $$$ is an axiom, and we take as a rule of inference that if a string of dollar signs is a theorem or axiom, then that string with one more dollar sign added on is also a theorem. Then, we might give the following as a proof of $$$$$: 

It's important to draw a distinction between useless and valueless. Music and art could be called "useless" in that they have no practical applications to the real world, but our lives are immensely better because of them: most people would be unwilling to give them up. A similar case can be made for modern research, especially in fields like pure mathematics, pure science, and philosophy. These fields have few (if any) practical applications to the real world, but it is absurd to say that they have no value: whether or not they are "useless", our lives are vastly greater because of them. If humanity focused solely on practical problems (e.g. building stronger bridges, finding more efficient ways to purify water, creating faster computer processors), I would be forced to ask "What's the point? Shouldn't we just try to enjoy our lives? To truly live?" For many people, solving practical problems doesn't bring joy and meaning into their lives; value comes from passion, spirituality, relationships, and understanding of one's place in the world. The world where people solely focus on practical applications isn't a world fit for humans, because it's art, music, philosophy, pure science, that tell us how we should live our lives, what our role is in this universe, and what it means to be human. So, in response to your question "how is philosophy useful?" I would say that as far as I know philosophy has at best few practical applications. But, in response to your other question, "Is philosophy really necessary?", I declare absolutely.
