Well as you mentioned there isn't really a weight limit to swimming. An adult blue whale can weigh up to 300,000 lbs. As long as a creature is not overly dense there isn't really a size limit to swimming. Now density on the other hand will very quickly kill a creatures ability to swim. It is hard to put a limit on it without looking at specific animals but, they'd lose the ability to swim fast. Keep in mind humans and most other mammals are equally dense to water, giving you "weightlessness." Any extra weight caused by increased density will just mean you need to exert that much more upward force to stay afloat. A normal human would not be able to swim with 10% increased density, as this is like (worse than) swimming with a lead weight equal to a tenth your weight. 

This depends on how bright this extra bright moon is. Naturally it could block out the stars if it was bright enough, just as the Sun prevents us from seeing the stars in daytime on Earth. If the question is if a moon can get this bright, it depends on a number of factors such as how close it is to the sun, how bright its sun is (More sunlight means more reflected light.), how large the moon is, how close the moon is to its planet, and what the surface of the moon is made out of. However I wouldn't doubt that it would be possible to block out many more stars, if not all, using the light from an extremely bright moon. 

This will never be worth doing. The thing about this is you have to apply a massive amount of energy to the atmosphere to cause these storms, and most of this energy is lost in the atmosphere. It is simply vastly more efficient to bomb people than make tornadoes to kill them. Maybe it is doable, but it is a herculean task with the same end result as the much easier task of dropping a bomb. 

Are you talking about a radio? It has a very large range of frequencies. If you mean a non-radio wave frequency, then also yes. Your TV remote or other similar controllers often use infrared light, which is a significantly higher frequency light wave. There isn't really anything stopping you from going to higher frequencies. but they have increasing energy requirements to produce, and are more likely to be blocked by obstacles. 

Unless the object remained in perfect alignment with you, you would be able to see it. If the object remained in alignment with you, you could still observe it by using multiple observers from different angles. The second possibility, light would pass straight through it. It lacks depth, it is possible light would simply pass straight through the infinitely thin object and move on unaltered. This basically would mean the 2D object was completely undetectable. 

You would likely need a warehouse in order to store liquid/gaseous materials such as fuel. I'm not sure about particle contamination, but it seems it will depend on how sensitive your material is. If it is a giant iron filled asteroid, or a block of iron, it would be durable enough you should be fine leaving it in orbit. The question comes down to how sensitive your materials are to contamination and radiation. However it might be better to simply put everything either in a warehouse, or strapped to the outside, as otherwise you would have to worry about collisions in a crowded orbit. 

I found an interesting article on the NASA website that may be relevant. Apparently the dust in Martian storms is electrically charged, so it will stick to solar panels and cover them. They may also stick to and blind cameras during a dust-storm. As for if the airborne dust would block infrared, it has to deal with the size of dust particles, density of dust, and the temperature of the dust. (If the dust is hot enough it may emit more infrared. 

The best way is the way you mentioned. If you simply don't need that much space, consider multiple smaller cylinders. If you are opposed to this for aesthetic reasons though I supposed we can consider a few other options. You could also try a counterbalance system. A computerized system shifting weight can offset the impact of movement inside the cylinder. Shifting liquid ballast could possibly prevent rotation, but it's not exactly energy efficient. Stabilize through the use of thrusters, or similar means. One more way to stabilize would be through using rockets or some other future propulsion system to counteract unwanted spin. Rockets however can run out of fuel, so maybe it uses magnets to manipulate itself within a magnetic field from a planet or sun? 

In the second generation all children would likely be taught English first, and the reason for this is simple. If your child speaks a different language then all the other children on the ship, they could feel isolated, they could have difficulty communicating with the other children and not have access to children of their age that speak their language. Consider that with only 160 people starting, you are probably looking at a lower number for children of the same age, as not all of the 160 will have kids at the same time. The ability of these children to socialize is already fairly limited by their limited access to other children, teaching them different languages and further limiting their ability to socialize is just bad parenting. English or any other common language would also be dominant by the 3rd generation. A major reason for this is because of marriages. If a French and English speaking man has a child with a German and English speaking woman, they will almost certainly teach their child English as a first language. Now in the first generation it is possible that they would sign up for the colony ship in pairs, and thus all speak the same first language as their significant others, and teach that language to their children. But beyond that people would likely have children with people who did not speak the same languages as them, besides the common language, in this case English. Thus by three generations it would be highly improbable a significant number of children would not speak English first. You also have to consider that all adults are already likely fairly fluent in English in order to be able to survive on this colony ship. This might not be true if it simply flies itself to its destination without needing maintenance. But if the crew were required to work together, fairly decent English would be required. Because of these reasons the influence of multiple languages would likely be reduced. 

As you mentioned, there is no such thing as an anarchic state. What you describe seems closer to a libertarian monarchy. If you were to have an actual anarchic state an army isn't necessarily needed to prevent foreign invasion. In your scenario these people religiously worship anarchy, they would resist any invading country without the need for a king ordering them around. (and they would also resist any king.) In a true state of anarchy (Not an anarchic nation) the ability to defend ones self is very important as the police are not their to help protect you. People wouldn't carry on as if nothing happened, homes would be more fortified and weapons would be stockpiled. 

The nature of pack hunters would mean that as their society evolved it would likely tend toward strong monarchies, with high respect for authority. It is natural for pack hunters to follow a single strong leader, so any species evolved from pack hunters would likely take much longer to embrace ideas of democratic rights, if they ever did. Loyalty to ones leader would likely be the most important moral duty. I'd imagine their society would be similar to feudal Japan. The natural tendencies of the pack rank system could easily evolve into a caste system. The leaders would likely be followed with fervent loyalty by the worry caste. They would also likely tend toward isolationism and nationalism, as other nation "packs" are competition. As for what religious beliefs these aliens would have, it is totally unpredictable, and likely each nation would have its own god/gods. Just look at earth, one species managed to create thousands of creation myths through out its history, tens of thousands of gods and mythical creatures. One interesting aspect to incorporate though, what other animals exist around these creatures? Local fauna often has symbolic appearances in religions. I would also consider that these species may be more likely to deify leaders, like in ancient Egypt, or feudal Japan. 

I don't know if putting them in your house would be practical, but spreading them out so they have sufficient area to feed and the harvesting them should help supplement dietary needs. Termites feed on decomposed plants and other materials that are mostly useless to humans and presumably your corvids, so there isn't really much cost to feeding them. They are also fairly self sufficient, so it probably wouldn't take much work at all. Maybe build a protective structure around the mounds to ward of predators, and then just collect free food. You don't have to worry about the termites escaping either, unlike some other livestock. I can't see any reason this would require too much work for the food it produces. 

Missile interception, while not yet a viable technology, it may be one day possible to prevent nuclear missile strikes through the use off missile intercept systems which fire off a missile to collide with and destroy enemy missiles. This technology is still in development, some recent tests have taken out mid range missiles. $URL$ Here is the page on the THAAD Missile intercept system from the Lockheed Martin website: $URL$ 

Creating a significantly low pressure environment to prohibit flight would harm humans. Planes already fly in a very rarefied section of atmosphere because the thinner air means less wind resistance. Lowering the atmospheric pressure at any level humans can handle would just cause planes to fly lower. Also rockets should work in any air oxygen dense enough to allow humans to breath. Plus having an inability to use rockets would mean any humans who went to Mars would be permanently trapped. I know you said you don't want storms, but the logical answer is storms. Storms, solar radiation storms or dust storms. Another solution, if you want to restrict access to only a few remote areas, is to make it too difficult to land on site. Planes cannot land in excessively rocky areas. There is still the possibility of helicopters, but they do handle less well in thin atmosphere. You could possibly combine a lack of runways to stop planes and frequent but more minor dust storms to discourage helicopters. 

The ears of an elephant work like radiators, when the elephant is hot blood is directed to the ears, where the large surface area allows for maximum heat dispersion. Heat sinks would also tend to be ineffective on a spaceship, as without a way to remove the heat the heat would simply build until critical. Heat sinks only make sense if the heat can then be removed from that point, either because the heat sink is a thermal-electric generator like @JBH mentioned, or because the heat sink is then jettisoned. If one kind of ship were to not use radiators it might make more sense for it to be the non-biological ships that do not radiate heat. 

No it is not possible for a planet to be incapable of supporting life simply by removing one gas from the atmosphere to prevent it from being breathable. Earth actually used to lack oxygen, but prehistoric plants created it through photosynthesis. There are bacteria that breathe other gasses as well. Probably in order to make it terraformable but not have life you want one of two things. A young planet doesn't necessarily need to be inhospitable, it just needs to not have yet developed life. Radiation problems could also prevent life, but could be blocked out with massive quantities of ozone, or other methods. 

Unfortunately this creature cannot be changed to be realistic without massive changes. The design does not offer any evolutionary benefit, and it has quite a few disadvantages: Wide body doesn't help it move faster or more efficiently, doesn't offer much to stability, and prevents the creature from fitting in between natural obstacles. The legs are actually the largest impediment to its movement. With lighter legs it would weigh less, making massive bones no longer necessary. In this creature the legs are bigger in order to support bigger legs. This simply isn't helpful, and is counterproductive too its movement. It almost certainly cannot swim. It certainly cannot climb, or possibly even go up a steep incline. Its arm is in a location that offers poor leverage for throwing things. So what should be changed? For starters I assume the heavier build is linked to a defensive need? If this were the case the width should be decreased and almost certainly the height. Animals with more armored builds always tend to be tighter and more compact to maximize protection. The arm should also probably be moved to the back like a scorpion tail and be long enough to reach all the way around in front of it. The extra length would help it work as a catapult. And the legs, they basically are simply not evolutionarily justifiable. 

A couple possibilities, the first is that it would actually be fairly easy to see a 2D object if one were to exist. While a 2D object turned sideways so that you were facing the nonexistent dimension would seem invisible, any tilt would cause the flat surface to be visible. If the object was large enough or you used a precise enough camera, then being out of alignment with the nonexistent dimension by mere fractions of a degree would make it visible. The further out of alignment you get the larger the 2D object will appear. 

They would probably not have teeth, unless they evolved from an animal that had teeth, and the teeth were used in self defense or for some other purpose not linked to eating, such as digging to find algae. That being said, if you want them to have teeth, you can easily go with the teeth for self defense option and give them very prominent teeth. A nose exists for breathing, so it would likely be unaffected, but if you want to avoid a nose you can give them the ability to breath from a different part of their body, similar to a whales blowhole or similar to gills. If you want to give it a mouth you may have it feed through the use of its tongue, similar to an anteater.
