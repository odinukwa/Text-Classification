Akhil, as one of those who struggled, I'd like to point out that nobody in a million years would have first come up with such an esoteric construction (if it is one) of the smash product of spectra, and nobody who actually understands their calculational role would dream of thinking that to be the primary version of the construction, or its most important property, or something that one would actually use as "the'' smash product. It may arguably be a useful point of view, even a very useful one, but not for algebraic topology as a calculationally intensive subject. It sheds no light on many of the calculationally central features of the smash product. There are different categories of spectra with different good constructions of "the" smash product, and it doesn't help to give the idea that the notion is solely the $\infty$-category version. It is not. And it really is too bad to try to tell people that "stability is an idea that you need $\infty$-categories to make sense of''. That idea has been very well understood since before I started out 50 years ago. You are referring narrowly to stability of $\infty$-categories, so you only ``need'' it when that is all that you are referring to. Not everything in life (I mean mathematics, no, I mean algebraic topology) is $\infty$-categories, not by a long shot. End of lecture. 

Under suitable hypotheses, Gugenheim and I use the binary $\cup_1$ and especially the fact that it is a graded derivation (Hirsch formula) as the key to giving a calculation of $H^*(G/H)$ as the torsion product over $H^*(BG)$ of $R$ and $H^*(BH)$, where coefficients are taken in a suitable commutative ring $R$. This even works for suitable $H$-spaces. See $URL$ and $URL$ 

Shulman's paper ``Homotopy limits and colimits and enriched homotopy theory'' (on arXiv) gives a thorough study of homotopy colimits in enriched contexts, and his enriching category $V$ can be taken to be the category of $G$-spaces for a topological group $G$. It specializes to answer your questions, in greater generality than you ask. The domain category for your diagrams, which I will denote $D$ as in Shulman, is implicitly a classical category (discrete hom sets), whereas Shulman allows hom objects in $V$. He defines "corrected'' weighted homotopy colimits in terms of two-sided bar construction in sections 13 and 20 and shows in his Theorem 13.7 and Corollary 13.12 that this gives the appropriate left derived functors of weighted colimits. (This becomes more general and explicit in his Theorems 20.4 and 21.1) The upshot is that anything you can prove for spaces will generalize appropriately to G-spaces, with the usual kind of CW replacements. Making $D$ explicit helps answer your last quandary. If your $D$ is just a plain category, a functor from $D$ to $G$-spaces is just a diagram of $G$-spaces and you just see things in spaces but with induced $G$-actions. The story is more interesting when $D$ has $G$-spaces of morphisms between objects and you consider enriched diagrams ($G$-maps of $G$-spaces on Hom's). 

A. The brackets are the same computed in any model, as you say, and for most that entails fibrant approximation. For genuine $G$-spectra (complete universe), $G$ a compact Lie group, it goes back to LMS $URL$ that a map is a weak $G$-equivalence if it induces an isomorphism on $Z$--graded homotopy groups, so on the $\pi_n^H$ for all integers $n$ and (closed) subgroups $H$. That is the right definition of weak $G$-equivalence by Theorem I.4.6 there, which says that a map is a weak $G$-equivalence if and only if it is a spacewise weak $G$-equivalence. Taking $H=G$, one is looking at trivial representations, and so the question amounts to asking when looking at all spheres $S^V$ for $V\in RO(G)$ is equivalent to looking at all $G/H_+\wedge S^n$. Justin's answer says that this is true for $G = Z/2$ and false for $G=Z/p$ for an odd prime $p$. A'. For G-CW spectra, as defined in LMS where all $G$-spectra are fibrant, a map is a weak $G$-equivalence if and only if it is a $G$-homotopy equivalence. For other models, one must first fibrant approximate and then construct $G$-CW spectra, giving the right model independent notion. Such $G$-CW spectra are not generally well related to model theoretic cell $G$-spectra. See Chapter 24 of $URL$ for discussion. B. Very few, as Justin says. Don't have time to think this through right now. C. Question is cryptic. Spell it out and I can try to answer. Not clear what you have in mind. 

Ah, Neil, my apologies, sins of a forgetful old man. You are quite right to object to Theorem 3 in that 1969 paper, because it is false as stated. In fact, Paul Goerss gave me a counterexample ages ago. That appears as Example 23.4.2 in More Concise Algebraic Topology, by Kate Ponto and myself, which is available here: $URL$ (and at booksellers everywhere). Advertising that book, it reworks Milnor and Moore, among other things, in Chapters 20-23. In response to Paul's counterexample, it also reworks the relevant part of the 1969 paper, proving a correct variant of the theorem you object to, namely Theorem 23.4.1. Work over a perfect field $K$. Theorem. Let $A$ be a connected, commutative, and associative quasi Hopf algebra. For a morphism of $K$-modules $\sigma: QA \rightarrow IA$ such that $\pi\sigma = id$, where $\pi: IA \rightarrow QA$ is the quotient map, let $R(A;\sigma)$ be the sub abelian restricted Lie algebra of $A$ generated by the image of $\sigma$. For a suitable choice of $\sigma$, the morphism of algebras $f: V(R(A;\sigma)) \rightarrow A$ induced by the inclusion of $R(A;\sigma)$ in $A$ is an isomorphism. Quasi here just means not necessarily coassociative. The proof is an adaptation of the proof of Theorem 4 in the 1969 paper, which is correct. The point is that you must choose the section carefully to make it go. 

J.P. May and J. Sigurdsson. Parametrized homotopy theory. Presumably the fibers should be grouplike. A current student, John Lind, could answer better. He is working on classification theorems in a more sophisticated context of parametrized spectra. 

I'll give a shot at an answer. The relevant dimensions are of the form $2^j-2$. For $j\leq 4$, it is easy and classical that we can construct manifolds of Kervaire invariant one. The problem was ``reduced'' from differential topology to pure stable homotopy theory by Browder in 1969. Direct calculational methods in homotopy theory were used by Barratt, Jones, and Mahowald to construct a cell complex that can be used to solve the homotopy theory problem and prove that such manifolds also exist in dimensions 30 and 62. I believe a construction of such a manifold has been worked out in dimension 30, but that has certainly not been done in dimension 62. Periodicity phenomena play a huge role in modern stable homotopy theory, and a crucial feature of the Hill, Hopkins, Ravenel proof is a periodicity of order $2^8 = 256$. That enables them to solve the stable homotopy problem and prove there is no manifold of Kervaire invariant one for $j\geq 8$. The reasons $j=7$ is so hard are several. Nobody has a really good reason for guessing which way the answer will go. There is no reason to expect a relevant periodicity of order $2^7$. Direct calculation of the Adams spectral sequence through dimension $126$ is just plain hard: the calculations blow up. There is a chance that the methodology of Barratt, Jones, and Mahowald might extend to prove existence (if that is how the answer turns out!), but it will probably be much harder to prove nonexistence (if that is the answer). 

This is not quite what you mean, but relevant. Remember that a strictly associative and unital symmetric monoidal category is called a permutative category. I observed ages ago ($URL$ that the unbiased version of that is the same thing as an algebra over the categorical Barratt-Eccles operad. Recently Corner and Gurski, $URL$ defined pseudoalgebras over operads in $Cat$. A pseudoalgebra over the categorical Barratt-Eccles operad is the unbiased version of a symmetric monoidal category that you are looking for, except that you ask for functors defined on all unordered finite sets. But, as usual, it is standard and reasonable when considering diagram categories, to pass to a skeleton so as to replace essentially small domain categories with actual small ones, and then one arrives at the definition just cited. Incidentally, this unbiased variant is essential in equivariant theory in progress where we define genuine symmetric monoidal $G$-categories and show how to construct genuine $G$-spectra from them, where $G$ is a finite group (joint work with Guillou, Merling, and Osorno, to be posted soon; see $URL$ 

As a matter of history, the original Bott maps are very explicit, and in fact they are $E_{\infty}$ maps with respect to the actions of the linear isometries operad (as shown in the first chapter of $E_{\infty}$ ring spaces and $E_{\infty}$ ring spectra). Bott himself, in his paper Raoul Bott. Quelques remarques sur les théorèmes de périodicité. Bull. Soc. Math. France 87 1959 293–310, showed how to derive the strong form from the weak form by showing that his original maps are homotopic to the adjoints of the evident maps obtained by tensoring with the Bott classes. He does this for the real and quaternionic cases as well. 

There is a very illuminating paper I did not know about when I last answered a similar question: Tyler Lawson. ``Commutative $\Gamma$ rings do not model all commutative ring spectra". Homology, Homotopy and Applications Vol 11, 2009, 189-194. The title says it all. Together with the monoidal functor from $\Gamma$-spaces to $W$-spaces of MMSS, Tyler's result makes clear that commutative $W$-rings cannot give a homotopy category equivalent to the categories of orthogonal, symmetric, or EKMM commutative ring spectra. Incidentally, the question has a minor slip. David writes: "By commutative here I mean strictly commutatative, not $E_{\infty}$". As explained in EKMM, strictly commutative EKMM ring spectra are Quillen equivalent to $E_{\infty}$ ring spectra as defined way back in the 1970's. Those still have the nicest connection to spaces, namely $E_{\infty}$ ring spaces. See my paper: What precisely are $E_{\infty}$ ring spaces and $E_{\infty}$ ring spectra. Geometry & Topology Monographs 16(2009), 215--282 (and on my web page) for a modern overview. 

I'd say it is an unfortunate accident you did that once, and you should not do it again. The question is not mathematics but readability: not a good idea to go against a universally accepted convention. The textbook Hilton and Wylie tried to go against convention (talking of contrahomology instead of cohomology) and probably for that reason was not a success. More seriously, no matter what the notation, a homology theory is not a cohomology theory. Perhaps the point is that it matters what category you are starting in. If you start work in Z-graded (co)chain complexes, it is purely a matter of notational convention which you choose. Not so if you start work in spaces. 

Mea culpe! Kate Ponto and I corrected the sloppy ``proof'' in Concise in Chapter 3 of More Concise Algebraic Topology, which gives a pedantically careful treatment of a more general result needed in our treatment of localizations and completions of nilpotent spaces. There we construct Postnikov towers of nilpotent spaces (which are restricted to have homotopy groups in some preassigned collection of abelian groups) rather than just simple spaces. The treatment can no longer claim to be brief, since the cited Chapter is 23 pages, but I hope people may find it instructive. It is based on a wholesale dualization of cellular theory to cocellular theory, in particular showing that two familiar theorems of Whitehead admit line by line dual proofs, and it gives a kind of cocellular functoriality of the construction of Postnikov towers: see Theorem 3.5.4. The role of the fundamental group is pinpointed in Lemma 3.4.2. That gives several characterizations of exactly when, given a based map $X \to Y$ between connected spaces with fiber a $K(A,n)$, there is a "$k$-invariant'' $k\colon Y \to K(A,n+1)$ whose fiber is equivalent to $X$ over $Y$. One characterization is that $\pi_1(Y)$ must act trivially $A$. 

The subject is really way too big (as are so many others of course). I worry a lot about students not in Cambridge or Chicago or Stanford or other places where there are people with folklore at their fingertips. For spectral sequences as a tool, there is a lot to be said for McCleary's guide. Kate Ponto and I just published a book this year, More Concise Algebraic Topology, that may be usable for localizations and completions (just the old-fashioned localize or complete at a set of primes) and that also gives a reasonable start on model categories. Even with that limited scope, the book is much longer than we would like: there were just too many basic details and tools not well enough documented in the literature. There are quite a few other books that go into one or another aspect of the subject (Goerss-Jardine, Neisendorfer, Strom, or, earlier, Whitehead), but it is not to be expected that a single source will cover the ground.
