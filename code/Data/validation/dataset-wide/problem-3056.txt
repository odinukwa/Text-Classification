I've been reading some different sources about the relationship between Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings and some authors seem to emphasize that she was essentially a sex slave, while other authors make it seem like it was consensual on her part. Is there any solid evidence either way? Obviously she couldn't exactly say no, but has anything been recorded that says she didn't want to enter into the type of relationship she had with Jefferson? 

I've read in various Holocaust memoirs that the difference between being a "half-Jew" and "full Jew" could mean life or death. Obviously, Nazi treatment of a "half-Jew" was better than a "full Jew", but to what extent? What are some examples of people surviving because of better treatment by Nazis because they were "half-Jews"? 

I'm reading The Economic Origins of Jeffersonian Democracy, by Charles Beard, and I came across this quote on page 52: "It is an interesting commentary on the quality of Jefferson's democracy that he chose Madison as his successor." What is it referring to and is it true? 

My late father commanded a B-47 bomb squadron from 1955-1964. The B-47 was a medium range bomber that was frequently forward deployed for weeks at a time at bases in Spain, Turkey and Libya, and kept there armed and on alert. After reading that the Air Force had declassified the list of Soviet and Warsaw Pact targets developed by the Strategic Air Command, I saw my father's former navigator and asked him whether it was true that after their mission they would fly to Turkey and eject, then walk home. He said, only, that "bailing out was definitely part of the plan." 

Although the article on the Cuban missile crisis at Wikipedia cites John T. Correll's article from the August 2005 issue of Air Force Magazine as saying that the Soviets had possibly only 4 operational ICBMs in October 1962, the record has changed as more and more documents come to be declassified. According to Robert S. Norris' presentation at the Wilson Center, the Soviet Union had about 42 operational ICBMs in October 1962. Norris, Robert S., "The Cuban Missile Crisis: A Nuclear Order of Battle" (Oct. 24, 2012). Soviet Gen. Dmitri Volkogonov in 1989, however, stated that the Soviets only had 20 ICBMs ready in October 1962, and "most analysts" accept Volkogonov's estimate than the higher US estimate. Bernstein, Barton J. "Reconsidering the Perilous Cuban Missile Crisis 50 Years Later," Arms Control Today (Oct. 2012). All-in-all, Norris' full count of all available nuclear weapons concludes: 

I'm writing a paper about what events and ideas led to the signing of the Declaration of Independence, and one thing I'm using is the corruption in the English government. My evidence includes the fact that 120,000 people out of a population of about 7 million in Britain were able to vote. First of all, is that true? Second, if so, what were the voting qualifications? Property? Wealth? What made someone able to vote? 

It refers to the people then and the people now, just the people in general who aren't happy with their government. 

In the Declaration of Independence, it says that King George III "protect[ed] [the British]... from punishment for any Murders which they committ[ed] on the Inhabitants of these States.” What are some examples of this? I searched for it but all I found was the Boston Massacre. Besides that (and even that one is debatable), are there any other cases of the king protecting the British from punishment? 

The American surrender of Wainwright's and Sharp's forces in the Philippines, during World War II, was the largest surrender of troops under the US flag in the history of the country. Reports at the time stated that US and Filipino troops were fighting hunger and illness in addition to the Japanese, and that there was no chance that the US could get supplies to them, given Japan's command of the seas at that point. However, American troops who refused to surrender, such as Col. Wendell Fertig, working with other American soldiers, organized Filipino resistence fighters into an effective insurgency of approximately 36,000 troops. By doing so, he caused the Japanese to divert 60,000 troops to Mindano in an unsuccessful attempt to crush the insurgency. Moreover, Fertig's insurgency force became one of the most effective intelligence sources available to MacArthur in that area. The supply problems that led Wainwright to surrender were largely solved by Fertig, an engineer, who creatively used native crops and materials, and salvaged allied and enemy stores and weapons, to supply, equip, and feed his forces. See John Keats, They Fought Alone: Wendell Fertig and the World War II Guerrilla Campaign in the Philippines, (J. B. Lippincott Company) (1963). Given that the US Army had relatively recent experience fighting against insurgencies in Central America (i.e. the Banana Wars), did it occur to MacArthur or his staff that Wainwright's and Sharp's forces would have been better off heading for the hills and fighting a guerrilla war, rather than surrendering? If not, what factors made MacArthur and his staff choose surrender instead? 

In that era, cotton was a luxury fiber Before roughly 1000AD, cotton was quite expensive. It is not easy to remove the seeds from the cotton boll, early cotton plants were not nearly as productive as modern varieties, and picking cotton requires a lot of unpleasant labor. 

That line still gets laughs today, although a large part of the audience today would wonder what happened in 1918. 

The statement is, on its face, absurd. "Monetary supply" is an inappropriate term to describe the economic workings of the era. In today's economy, there are practically as many definitions of "monetary supply" as there are economists (or, at least, statistical agencies), and there is no meaningful definition for the term in a pre-modern context. I suppose that the author here simply meant coinage, but then he falls into a different fallacy. Gold and silver coins are a convenient means to store and transfer value. However, they are far from the only means and historically have rarely been the dominant means. Credit, ranging in sophistication from tokens and tally sticks to bills of exchange; paper money; commodity money, ranging from measures of grain in ancient Mesopotamia to pelts in colonial America; and other tokens such as wampum and cowries; all compete with gold and silver in the "marketplace of money". Gold and silver have advantages in this marketplace - they are durable, portable and broadly fungible - but they are hardly irreplaceable. Rather than to say that the supply was inadequate, it would be better to say that there was unmet demand for gold and silver in the European marketplace. The great question is, thus, to what degree did the influx of American silver increase the money supply, as opposed to simply displacing other forms of exchange. Unfortunately, most of the other forms of exchange are all but invisible to the historian. We can hardly do better than guess at the number of tally sticks and I.O.U.'s used in the past, or estimate how that number has changed. Researchers interested in the question scour the most basic documents of the era - particularly banking and shipping records and contracts of all kinds. It is a complex question and you'll find plenty of spirited disagreements in the literature. 

I've learned about how Luther's 95 Theses were extremely important to the Protestant Reformation and how they really defined the beginnings of Protestantism. According to History.com's article on "Martin Luther and the 95 Theses", the two main points of the theses were "that the Bible is the central religious authority and that humans may reach salvation only by their faith and not by their deeds", which would support what I've been taught, as the idea of sola fide is heresy, according to the Catholic church. However, I read through them, I didn't find that. They really only support the idea that Indulgences aren't right and that the greed found in the Catholic Church at the time wasn't acceptable. Most of them even include references to purgatory (which is heresy in Protestantism), and "works of mercy" and "works of love", which is the language commonly used to refer to the Catholic Church's works necessary for salvation, which Luther was supposed to disagree with (also heresy in Protestantism). What causes this seeming discrepancy? Why are the theses so important if they only address the idea that the Church's greed wasn't right? I understand that was a radical position at the time, given that the Church ruled essentially everything and dissenters were punished, but there is a wide margin between saying greed is bad and breaking away from the Catholic Church and beginning a new denomination. 

CDR David G. Muller, Jr., USN (Ret.) -- an intelligence specialist with the Navy and the CIA, discusses this, to an extent, in his recent memoir, "Knowing the Enemy: An Intelligence Officer's Memoir 1966-2014." (Note, I served under CDR Muller in the mid-1980s.) CDR Muller states that intelligence gathering long focused on the Soviet Union, to the exclusion of other countries -- especially within the Naval Intelligence community -- because the Pentagon needed intelligence about the Soviet threat to justify to Congress the need to appropriate money for bigger and better weapons. Intelligence reports on the Far East, or elsewhere, was in high demand by the tactical commands, such as Pacific Command, or Sixth Fleet, for example, were more likely to have to invade or intervene in wars against less-capable enemies (e.g. Libya or Syria), or terrorists threats. Nevertheless, as I understood his book to say, the CIA was completely on board with Reagan's plan to out-spend the Soviets on weapons purchases, and bankrupt the regime by forcing it to keep up its defense spending. Although Muller does not address that Reagan's "Star Wars" program, which other analysts have said was a bluff, CDR Muller once told me that he was pleased that novelist Tom Clancey had, at times, exaggerated the capabilities of US intelligence gathering and weapons technology -- "let the Russians try to replicate that capability -- they will go broke doing so," he said with regard to another area of technology that I cannot discuss further. After the fall of the Soviet Union, Muller writes that the intelligence agencies finally turned to spend resources on intelligence gathering on other threats -- something he had campaigned for since the late 1970s. The Pentagon, unfortunately, determined that the end of the Cold War and the deterioration of the Russian/Soviet Navy and other armed services, meant that scores of relatively new destroyers and submarines would be sunk or (in the case of nuclear-powered ships and submarines, dismantled and recycled) well before the end of their service lifespan. The option to mothball the vessels and preserving them for later needs was rejected as unnecessary and too expensive (plus upgrading the older ships would mean less new construction). 

So I understand, maybe, how arming people to hurt others is treason because the "others" who will be hurt are Americans. So is it treason if, for example, a gun store owner provides a gun to someone s/he knows will use it to hurt others? I'm sure that's something, maybe indirect murder or something, but is it treason? If not, why was John Brown's raid treason? 

With the Hamilton (a musical by Lin-Manuel Miranda about Alexander Hamilton's life) craze going around, I've heard a few of the songs. While they are typically very easy to understand, one lyric I didn't understand was in "Washington on Your Side" when Madison, Jefferson, and Burr say: "[MADISON] So he’s doubled the size of the government / Wasn’t the trouble with much of our previous government size? [BURR] Look in his eyes! [JEFFERSON] See how he lies [MADISON] Follow the scent of his enterprise [JEFFERSON] Centralizing national credit / And making American credit competitive [MADISON] If we don’t stop it we aid and abet it [JEFFERSON] I have to resign". What does it mean that Alexander Hamilton made American credit competitive? 

In popular culture, absolutely. Among historians, not so much. I stumbled across a 12-volume history of the "Great War" at a garage sale some time ago. The tone in this series is grim but grounded. The Germans are considered the aggressor, a dangerous enemy, and possessed of few (if any) scruples. I doubt anyone would publish such an extensive series today, but if anyone felt that an update was necessary, I suspect that the tone would actually be more sympathetic to the Continental powers. Today's historians are an equivocating lot, quick to accept (or at least, repeat) the arguments of the apologists of even the most odious regimes. Decades of Cold War conflicts in places like Vietnam, Suez, and Nicaragua have trained scholars to put democratic and absolutist regimes on the same plane and to find the seeds of conflict in economic and class issues. The tendency among modern historians to call for "a pox on all their houses" is much stronger today than before WWII. But whereas historians tend to be just a little kinder to the Germans today, in popular culture the opposite is true. The depiction of the Germans in Wonder Woman is certainly the most appropriate example at the moment. There are two reasons for this. First, WWI is barely taught in American schools today and most Americans conflate it with WWII. And about the only thing the average American knows about WWI is that the Germans used poison gas and sunk the Lusitania with a submarine. These do not give Germany a positive image (although the Germans also had zeppelins, which really looked cool.) Finally, to most Americans, WWII was just Germany's "second try". A nice example from the popular culture of the 1960s is the Tom Lehrer song about the MLF (Multi-lateral Nuclear Force) being mooted at the time. 

I was told by a history-loving friend that one of the reasons Aaron Burr wanted to duel Hamilton was because Hamilton had published something rather derogatory about Burr's daughter Theodosia in a local newspaper. First of all, is this true? I've searched for it but haven't found anything- Google results are covered with "Dear Theodosia", a song from the musical "Hamilton". What did Hamilton write? 

What was the first civilization to, with a law, ban slavery that had it previously? For example, if Civilization X never had slavery and it makes a law banning it without ever having had slaves, I won't count that for these purposes. I've looked online but found nothing. *I'm aware of the other question about slavery. This is different because this is asking which civilization actually banned slavery after having it, not who was the first person to realize slavery was wrong.
