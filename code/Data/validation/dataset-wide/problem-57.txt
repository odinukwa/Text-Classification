Behind a star or planet would be a good place; not in orbit but powered to remain behind it from the perspective of some other POV. However, any kind of "behind" implies a single direction or location of viewing. I can easily stay behind the Earth's Moon from the POV of Mars, taking all those orbitals into account: At any given point in time Mars and the Earth's Moon form a line I can be on to put the Moon between me and Mars. That breaks down if we add Venus to the mix. Generally Venus and Mars are not both on the same line as the Moon, so hiding from one may not hide me from the other. If the enemy has a lot of scouts, hiding behind the star might work, but if they are on all sides of it, even something that big wouldn't work. A better idea would be a disguise: Disguise the space station as an asteroid (or several of them) in the asteroid belt, or Oort cloud, or as a chunk of rock orbiting a planet like a Moon. Remember in space the disguise is weightless; so it could be an actual shell of rock or asteroid ice, perhaps even manufactured from the asteroids and dust in the belt (or wherever it is hiding); glued or netted together. An even better approach would be a station that could land on small low-gravity moons and disguise itself as a natural terrain feature. The strategy is to become a mottled brown needle in a haystack. 

I know you (the OP) have settled on commercial reasons; but in reading the setup I imagine privacy and/or military advantage could be at stake. The inhospitable environment make for a natural "moat" around the city; difficult to attack by surprise and defensible. The nature of the city makes it an oasis in this inhospitable environment: If there is any military advantage in dominating this area, then this is the place to build. For secret research or other operations (like keeping prisoners), this city is difficult to observe secretly, and any escapees probably cannot leave the city without dying. 

YES, the technology is feasible for the time. Romans used hamster Wheels to build the Coliseum: See this clip from the Science Channel of one in action: $URL$ One girl can use it to lift a 1200 lb block, and three students together raise a 5200 lb block off the ground. There is a drawing of such a wheel from Roman times; and the wheel and the compound pulley it uses were known to Romans (although the compound pulley may not be necessary for powering a ship). Other examples are shown here, as cranes, plus examples proving the Romans knw how to use various forms of gearing. $URL$ Such a wheel is almost entirely powered by legs. Romans were very familiar with gearing as well; and were making both wrought iron and steel in the Noricum province ($URL$ The Hamster wheel creates power in a rotating axle; using simple gearing it could be used to turn a propeller. Note also, sealant is not necessarily a problem, the equivalent of an outboard motor propeller is easy enough to engineer: An outboard motor uses a propeller without piercing the hull of the ship; it is just mounted on the outside of the hull. The Romans were extremely competent engineers and could have devised a system of gears, axles, pulleys, whatever to transfer the power generated by the wheel inside the boat to an underwater propeller that was outside the boat, and pushing the boat. (One simple idea: Turn the wheel 'sideways' so the axle is aligned with the long axis of the boat). Multiple wheels could power multiple propellers; useful for steering or extra power when needed. Imagine 3 side by side: power the left wheel to turn right, power the right wheel to turn left, power left+right to go straight, power left+middle+right to go straight faster. All the engineering skills and required materials for such a system were in place 2000 years ago; so the only missing pieces are inspiration and the power or money to turn inspiration into a working product. 

I up voted Thriggle's answer, but I think I can add some other notes. In fantasy settings, the users of Dragons are the very important, rich, and powerful, and occasionally the lucky protagonist for whom everything in the world is a novelty. Further they are seldom kept like horses, writers deal with their size by letting them run free and come when needed. I don't think the dragons "scale" (pun intended!). In the USA, there are about 254 million cars for an adult population of 242 million; slightly over one per adult. Only 8% of households have no car at all. My wife and I each own a car, parked in our garage, sitting quietly and requiring zero food, shelter or entertainment for weeks on end if we decide to go on a vacation, or if I leave on assignment or for a conference. Our residential land doesn't have enough grass to keep alive a dog-sized goat; much less two full grown dragons. What would food costs be for two dragons? As earlier answers say, machines are just cheaper. I am in the AI and automation field: Manufacturing robots in America, like those making cars and many other products, currently cost roughly 25c per operating hour for their life, that include the capital cost (initial price of the robot), all fuel, downtime for maintenance, and all repairs. Twenty five cents per hour! That is why they are replacing workers, even overseas workers. Machines are just cheap, their fuel is cheap, they have no emotions and feel no pain, they can be scrapped, warehoused or sold at will without facing any moral dilemma. I am not being cruel to leave my car parked at the curb, exposed and freezing, in a raging blizzard. In terms of providing service to humans: Machines are just better, enslaving animals creates (for most modern Americans at least) moral dilemmas about the treatment of the work animals, beating them or otherwise causing them pain, misery or death (for example by exposure to harsh weather, cold, heat, desert environments), dealing with their injuries and illness, feeding them, using them for food, disposing of them. Nobody is morally outraged if you break the axle on your tractor trying too hard to pull a tree stump out; it was just a tool. If that is a horse's leg, and you were beating him bloody to make him pull harder, and then you have to shoot him in the head: Now people start to feel moral outrage. 

I also think you have the problem of War being the last resort of losers. To counter that, we can make War expensive in a different way: Form (as a given in the story) an Alliance of Kingdoms, not with authority over any individual King, but promising mutual defense against invasion by each other. Part of their alternative to war is to settle disputes between Kingdoms by a contest of champions. If any King refuses to honor the outcome of a contest of champions; their kingdom is forfeit and ALL the other Kings are honor bound to band together, invade and divide the spoils equally, putting the offending King to death. All such disputes are presented to the Alliance, and the contest of champions is conducted in their arena, with the two Kings in (very comfortable) custody. The winner is determined by the Alliance, in case of complications (say both duelists end up dead). Once the decision is made, the losing King must give his orders (for withdrawal, payment, etc) and shall remain in (very comfortable) custody until they are carried out. To be fair, you have the problem of a King with the world's best duelist just invading territories and taking what he pleases, always depending on his Champion to defend his thievery. To counter that, require Kings to show up to the duel with ten champions each. The Alliance can determine who they believe is the more wronged King: The one wronged gets to pick his own champion from his Ten, and can then exclude any one of his opponent's champions, and the one to fight will be selected by lottery from the remaining nine. 

Almost certainly not. This is hand-wavy fiction; all life as we know it is a biological machine, all electrical energy that does any kind of work does it by affecting a physical object made of atoms. Stars get their energy by fusing atoms. Our physics explain virtually every physical phenomenon known to man, and although I am in the camp of people that consider our physics incomplete and probably wrongly formulated (due to the serious incompatibility between general relativity and quantum mechanics), it is more like being in the bullseye of the target without hitting the precise center point of the bullseye; it has been exhaustively tested against reality without failing, and cannot be far off the mark. It doesn't allow "pure energy", unless you count mass itself as a compressed form of energy (which it is; remember $E=m\cdot c^2)$, but if you use that quibble, then we are already beings of pure energy. :-) Energy must be applied to particles or atoms; you must have action and reaction to get ordered and constrained rearrangement of atoms; which is what is required for any kind of machine, computation, or life. You don't get "thinking" without changing something physical. 

Read Anton Golov's answer to if our universe was a simulation what could a bug look like? To crash it you need a bug in the simulation to exploit; and very few such bugs are actually going to crash a simulation; most will appear to be some sort of anomalous or inconsistent physics. For example, in simulating movement of objects, I once had a bug in which my simulation let one type of object pass right through other objects, instead of colliding with them. A simulation could fail to translate physical position under movement: To us that would look like a moving object suddenly jumped in space or just disappeared. Or perhaps the bug looked up the wrong physical characteristics, and an object (as small as an atom, big as a world) suddenly turned to solid uranium or hydrogen. Most bugs do not crash programs; they just make the program do something unexpected. Inside the simulation, this would look like a new law of physics, or just something we never can explain. (Think of mysteries of the universe we have now, like Dark Matter, Dark Energy, the lack of monopoles, and several other anomalies in physics). It would be something that does not seem to add up or comply with the physical laws we have discovered about how the world and universe and all its systems work (including biological, chemical, physics and particle physics). To Crash It, you'd need a runaway bug; and from inside the system this would be either unnoticeable (like time comes to a stop) or some kind of exponentially growing "infection" of the universe that destroys everything (e.g. a black hole that is unexplainably growing fast and will swallow everything. The manifestation of a crash of a simulation is always a halt of the simulation; the program stops running. Now the computer I am running on may be processing instructions at full tilt; but if I am in an infinite loop the simulation isn't going anywhere: It is halted. Most crashes are a result of bugs that accidentally over-consume resources, like computer memory or storage space, so the machine doing the computations for the simulation (which obviously is not IN the simulation) does not have the resources to continue. Or, giving such a machine orders it cannot complete; like to decide on a course of action using a variable that has accidentally been left 'undefined' in the code. You might not ever see it. IRL, many simulations take very long for us to run (Last year I read Military researchers required about a week of calendar time to accurately simulate air flow for thirty seconds worth of flight for a new kind of multi-rotor drone supply platform). Because of that, many such simulations take check-points, where they store a 'snapshot' of the entire system every so often (like every 15 minutes), both to help them track down bugs and crashes, and if they are confident the problem did not affect the simulation up to some previous checkpoint, they will restart the simulation from that checkpoint. From inside the simulation, we would not ever see the crash: Suppose a simulation crash in our 2015 leads to the destruction of the universe. Our simulation programmers, trace this back to a bug that first manifested itself in our 1987: When Fleischmann and Pons first recorded cold fusion. But unlike our history, that turned out to be real, due to a bug in the simulation's treatment of interactions between palladium and deuterium. Once this interaction starts producing free energy, a runaway reaction causes a black hole that consumes the universe. Bummer. The simulation programmers investigate this, and being clever, they figure out a way that Fleischmann and Pons might have seen what they saw, but with their results being due to some sort of intermittent equipment problem (and their experiments were intermittently 'successful' and not) localized to their lab. They have a checkpoint from 1972, with a slight modification they can introduce this equipment flaw, and also correct the interaction bug. They restore the universe to that state: Things work out ever so slightly differently. Palladium and Deuterium interactions produce zero free energy; the bug is corrected. The equipment flaw trick Fleischmann and Pons, but their experiments cannot be replicated and they are discredited. Nothing at all happens in our 2015, and the simulation continues: But the simulation programmers have saved 13.7 billion of our years in simulation time, and perhaps that makes a difference to them.
