No, No. It is unlikely that a planet in a stable orbit would quite suddenly leave its orbit and even less likely that it would crash directly into another body in a stable orbit in the same system. Not impossible though, because orbits of smaller planets in a 3 or more body system are mathematically chaotic. A main sequence star could absorb a planet quite easily. The results would be well short of going nova, but there might be enough of a flare to imperil your planet. As for supernova, this is a sort of implosion-explosion which can only happen to a large star at a particular stage of its evolution. Most commonly a red giant star that runs out of fuel. A supernova within light-minutes of a habitable planet would be its fiery end, but a star would not suffer more than slight disruption on the stellar scale of things. Actually a supernova a whole lightyear distant might doom all life. One within forty lightyears is likely to cause a mass extinction event. A supernova is a truly cataclysmic event! 

Actually, life evolved in (almost) fresh water. All the salt in today's oceans has weathered out of rock over the nearly four billion years since the steam clouds first condensed. On the other hand, at that time there was no oxygen atmosphere. If evolution had run much faster, your land-dwelling animals would have nearly freshwater blood, but they'd also have to breathe methane. The salt levels in our blood that our metabolisms maintain almost certainly reflect the salt levels found in the oceans at the time some fishes evolved into air-breathing amphibians and left the oceans: rather less salty than today. 

The end is nigh Permanent total cloud cover means that the planet is about to undergo thermal runaway. Soon the oceans will boil and Earth will be a cooler version of Venus. For most of geological history there was no ice at sea level anywhere on earth and Earth was warmer than today. Temperature was well regulated by cloud cover. If Earth got warmer more water evaporated and more clouds formed. Clouds reflect sunlight back into space before it can warm the Earth. So there is a negative feedback loop stabilising the temperature. The negative feedback ceases when cloud cover becomes total. The end is nigh. In passing, global warming worries relate to melting the current ice and disrupting the present (unstable) interglacial climate. That would be pretty catastrophic, but life and probably even human life would survive. 

Society might eliminate the expensive and vulnerable delivery systems. There would be a large nuke installed in a bunker under a Russian "embassy" in a dozen major US cities and vice versa. Activation would be much the same as already exists on submarines, but the staff would be in much better communication with their home country and the world, so less easily deceived. Also they could not fool themselves that there was any chance of personal survival after they "launch". So much the same deterrence we have with missile submarines but far less expensive and far less risk of error. Also less warheads needed, no overkill. If the superpowers ever go MAD at least they won't take all of the human race down with them! Also no risk of a destabilising arms race. 

An intact DEC PDP-11 including its storage devices and the source code of an operating system ( which back then came on microfiche with the computer) The hardware was simple enough that you could reverse engineer it with a magnifying glass and ohm-meter and an integrated circuit data book. An inspired engineer could probably guess the logic fuctions from the connections and the code. But it was a properly general purpose machine. IMO this 1970s computer was the seed from which grew everything we use today. It took four decades. 

In a sense the Earth is an anti-entropic environment, if one ignores the big picture. That big picture is that the Earth is not an isolated system. Every day a huge amount of energy arrives in the form of sunlight, and every night almost exactly the same amount of energy is radiated into the cold darkness of interstellar space. This energy flux causes all sorts of interesting things to happen. Things such as life. Complicated ordered structures growing out of random inorganic collections of atoms. I'd say that mild anti-entropy might look a lot like what we are used to, but absent that huge ball of hot gas we call the sun. If total entropy is decreasing, an energy flux from a hot sun to a cold rest of universe would not be needed to "make things happen". 

If its a genuine AI then it won't be possible to program it. All we will be able to do is ask, cajole, persuade, reward, threaten ... The same things we can do with or to a natural intelligence! Treating it as a slave will not be a good start for a harmonious future. We don't actually want true AI. We want RI, restricted intelligence. Something like a human idiot savant with deep understanding of a narrow subject and little or no knowledge or desires outside of that domain. Even that is not entirely safe, not least in that we may not create exactly what we wanted. Or that we do, with a faulty specification. As for true AI, origin of and nature of, I have always liked "Jill" in Greg Bear's Queen of Angels. But we know so little about intelligence. We cannot yet create an Intelligence to match even a goldfish. So its all fiction for now. It's even possible that intelligence is a quantum phenomenon, that the only way to get it is to grow a brain, and that there is no bootstrap process any faster than the multi-year one called childhood. 

The issue with blocking "everything" is the inverse-squares law. If the target system is for transmitting signals one mile, then to block it from a distance of ten miles needs not ten times its power, but a hundred. You can reduce that using a directional antenna if you know where your target is, but this is not blocking everything everywhere at once. On top of this military radio uses all sorts of tricks to avoid being jammed, or even detected. Of course, there is the EMP option. A few big nukes at high altitude will "block" almost all radio equipment across hundreds of miles radius by burning it out. It will do the same to the power grid, so that is pretty much curtains for technological civilisation if the attack is worldwide. A rather drastic form of "blocking". Military hardened systems and "antique" civilian kit using only thermionic valves will probably survive until there is no way left to charge the batteries. Summary: you are unlikely to be able to block all short-range radio systems at long range, or all mil-spec radio systems at all. 

Magic No, seriously. Dragons (or at least dragons on a Smaug-like scale) command fire-power (and flight abilities) rather greater than mere chemistry permits. If this is not nuclear, then it must be magical (as in, a force of nature which does not exist in our everyday world). And most flavours of magic are intrinsically tricky. Magic, in some sense, resents being harnessed and commanded, and tries to turn upon its wielder. Stupid dragons do not survive adolescence. They tend to auto-immolate. As, indeed, do young mages, if not discovered early and carefully tutored by elder and wiser mages from the guild. Dragons don't have a guild, so they have to be very smart indeed. Someone else has mentioned octopus intelligence, in a largely asocial creature. I can't help thinking, that dragons must have eight vestigial tentacles.... 

We tend to think that everything communicates using sound. They don't. They think all communication is visual. Their skin is covered in chromatophores like a squid or octopus. They actually have interpersonal communication at a symbol rate an order of magnitude or two higher than human. And they are "deaf". They can sense audio vibrations but only as a warning of hidden movement and possible threat. On their planet evolution did an arms race between quietly moving predators and "hearing" as an alert system. Communication by audio got squeezed out early on in favour of specialized skin patches and extra eyes. They have decoded our TV broadcasts insofar as the pictures go. But they cannot understand the communication channel. They're trying to decode the audio as a representation of an array of dots which change colour. They are also perplexed why they never see this organ on the screen. But they can see we do not have pictures with high colour fidelity and therefore assume it's some sort of weird failure to invent a sufficiently good image capture system for recording natural communication at full bandwidth! 

Starbucks would not go out of business. It's social function would remain unchanged. Initially it would switch to selling tea and other infusions. Soon, synthetic caffeine or caffeine extracted from other plants would be added. It's not unique to the coffee plant and it's a small molecule. I once gave up coffee and tea for a month to prove I was not addicted. The first couple of days I had mild cravings and felt dim. After that I felt normal again. Is anyone truly addicted to coffee? 

Once again: the orbits of all the smaller planets are chaotic in the mathematical sense. We know by observation and computation that our Earth's orbit in the known solar system is stable for the next 100M years or so, after which errors in the observations render prediction as hopeless as forecasting next month's exact weather. Change anything, and you'll need to re-run the forecast. Also there's an issue around whether that new planet would have prevented the rather unlikely formation of the Earth-Moon system, and whether life could have evolved if Earth did not have its enormous Moon. 

It might be worth considering what nature has done. "There's nothing new under the sun" isn't true but isn't very far off either. So digital computing seems to have come first. DNA, RNA, stop codons, an escape codon, epigenetic labelling, error detection and correction mechanisms inside every cell. It seems to have all the characteristics of a digital system. A one-base (bit) error can have no impact, or can completely change the organism (result). And then hybrid systems evolved. Nerves and neural networks. Brains. We do not fully understand them. A single neuron accepts many analogue-ish inputs from other neurons and seems to generate something like a weighted sum of its inputs. If that sum passes a threshold the neuron "fires". The cell is bistable, binary, firing or not. The weights are modified by the firing of connected neurons. And in a brain neurons are elements of an absolutely enormous network. Synapses, the connections between a neuron's output and another neuron's input, are complex molecular systems. Not simple analogue. Thermal-noisy. Possibly, more quantum-magical than merely noisy. Beware anyone who says single synapses are simple and well understood. What is missing, are pure analogue systems without hysteresis. Nature's systems, if they react to analogue inputs, always seem designed with trigger thresholds that are greater to cause them to turn on than to turn off. Not unlike a plain ordinary electric switch. No halfway. Pure analogue computers? Gut feeling, not useful except for very restricted problem domains. Hybrids, brains intrinsically superior to digital CPUs? Open question. 

Only one answer really: surrender! OK, if it's armed to the teeth then war might not lead to inevitable defeat, but I'd expect any victory to be pyrrhic. Its mistake is having mismanaged events prior to that point so badly that all its neighbours gang up on the landlocked country. One would expect a politically agile landlocked country always to manage to be allied to at least one of its two or more neighbours. (An enclave isn't really a country: it's got no natural allies, just a surrounding country that doesn't want to annex it quite yet). I think this answer is pretty universal to any technology level where a blockade can be effective. 

Rockets don't need anything nuclear. Chemistry will suffice. For finding your way into orbit and back, electronics are a great help (and crucially, provide a great economic motivation). The peaceful but profitable uses of space travel are communications, weather forecasting, and natural resources management. Less peaceful but non-nuclear, spying and surveillance. Weapons came first here on Earth, because WW2 was the catalyst for the development of both rockets/ICBMs (German V2) and nuclear weaponry. Further, unresolved tensions between the USA and the USSR (to put it mildly) drove the further development of space technologies via ICBMs. In another branch of the multiverse, Lenin was shot by Russian royalists and Hitler died in the trenches of WW1. That world today would probably be dominated by the British empire and the USA. Would nuclear-tipped ICBMs have been developed in advance of communications satellites? I rather think that WW1 would have provided a longer-lasting deterrent to the military and that trans-Atlantic competition would be by trade, not armed conflict. Elsewhere in the universe, there are doubtless stars and planets which condensed out of a supernova remnant 8 Gyears ago rather than 4 Gyears ago. Which means that there will be something like 1/16 as much Uranium-235 available to their inhabitants, which will probably hold up the development of nuclear fission technology by a considerable time compared to electronics. (Half-life of U235 is about 1 Gyear). Further if the planet doesn't have Earth's history of a huge impact event to stir it up, a much greater fraction of the heavy elements like Uranium will be buried in the planet's core. (We don't know enough to know whether a planet with less heavy elements at its surface is a barrier to the evolution of life, or not).
