This video which Sankha referenced says that there are levels of perversion i.e. "perception", "thought", and "view" – and that Sakkayaditti is a view whereas Mana is a perception. By analogy you might: 

Here is not an expert opinion: which is that I don't know why you expect that the total number of sentient beings is finite, countable, and constant. The perspective in the OP seems to be that the total number is constant, and is asking, "If the number of humans is increasing, then where (which realms) are they (pre-existing beings) coming from and why?" It has a view of, "this used to be (countably) one old sentient being, and that (same) being is now being reborn as (countably) one new sentient being" ... it has a view that, the type of being and/or realm might change (hell, animal, human, deva), but the total number of beings must be constant. I don't see why you'd expect that view to be true, though: it seems to me an atman (self/soul) view, not an anatman view. So far as I know a more anatman view might be look "there's no person now" (there are are just skandhas, an assemblage of parts, c.f. the parable of the Milinda's chariot), "the number of sentient beings isn't countable" (except perhaps to the Buddha), and fabricated things are inconstant. 

My main study at school was actually Maths not Physics. IIRC Maths doesn't try to prove everything. Progress in Maths depends on making or accepting assumptions (called an "Axiom)", and then saying, "given this axiom, what further theories can we prove?" Or conversely, "In order to prove this theory, what axioms do we need to assume?" I think there's no shame in treating some statement as axiomatic -- I guess2 that doing so is inherent in any attempt to use logic. For example, a Syllogism depends on "premises". Quoting from this answer again: 

On this site, the community wants/wanted to be less strict about accepting or closing questions, so we have a very liberal (permissive) policy about not closing questions, and people sometimes answer questions which aren't clear. What are ones reasons willing to change answers, questions, delete parts, modify... afterwards if it is unskillful? I sometimes edit other people's answers, to improve the formatting, grammar, and spelling (to make them easier to understand). I don't think I try to change the content of other people's answers. I sometimes delete or reword (soften) a fragment of an answer, if I think that fragment seems hostile. I tend to edit (add to) my own answer, if the OP edits their question, or if the OP posts a comment which asks an additional question. How to go beyound such problems, what whould be a secure solution? I suppose theoretically we might lock or protect questions so they can't be edited after they're answered. But I think that would be too rigid a policy, because instead I think it's good to clarify (improve) questions, just as it's good to improve answers, especially if it remains our policy to accept (not close) slightly unclear questions. I suppose we should (and maybe usually do) try to draw the line at asking a completely new question. If the OP has a new question or a follow-on (subsequent, related) question, that should be posted as a new question (or perhaps as a comment under an answer, asking to clarify that answer). Instead of a "secure" solution (automatically making questions read-only) maybe have a human or humane, flexible or responsive solution, which tries to provide appropriate responses on a case-by-case basis (e.g. the comment you posted when you decided that changing that question would be too much of a change given the existing answers). What are the consequences of missinterpreting I suppose a consequence is that the Q&A is less useful than it might be. We shouldn't lose track of the fact that the Q&A is meant to help the OP and other readers. And I think it's meant to be primarily helpful to the OP (who asks and maybe revises the question), so I'd hope for a solution which doesn't make the site less usable for the OP (in this case I hope that asking the OP to post a new question might have not hurt anyone). But always locking a question, never letting an OP clarify their question, seems to me too rigid. it should not be taken as meta I think you don't like Meta for some reason. On the other hand some users (perhaps most users) are uninterested in discussing how the site is run, and topics about the site (especially if the site consisted, mainly or mostly, of topics about the site) are uninteresting and off-putting. Moderators generally do and will continue to move topics about the site, the site's policies, and how the site should or shouldn't be used, to Meta. Make use of "on hold" and possible protection of question I think that's going too far. But I could try to do it, if a lot of people agreed on it (e.g. if several users agreed on Meta that it's a necessary and desirable new policy). notification of answerers in cases of question changes The current software doesn't support that feature. A programmer could possibly write a user script (a "stack app") to check if questions are edited after you answer them. That job would be more complicated for you, because you have about half a dozen user accounts. 

This sutta says that about "hindrances" and "profit of self and other", but I don't think it mentions jhāna. 

One way to look at it would be from the point of view of stress: if meditation helps cope with stress, and if the job is stressful, then meditation helps with the job, am I right? But IDK whether a company might admit whether their employees are subject to stress? I remember Tom DeMarco's The Deadline: A Novel About Project Management (1997) included the claim/observation that, "People under pressure don't think any faster." For anecdotes about the connection between stress, problem solving, and concentration, you might find some large percentage of developers (and research scientists/engineers) have had or remember the experience of "seeing the solution to a problem" when they "stop thinking about the problem". I remember puzzling over a bug during one afternoon, and then more-or-less suddenly "seeing" the cause of it after I left work and was walking home and enjoying the day (weather and landscape) outside. That seems to be so common-place that it could be an archetypal way of problem solving: you have a problem, so, you go out for a walk, ... I found it noticeable with cigarettes too, when I used to smoke: feel stressed at work, step outside for a smoke, feel destressed, inevitably therefore see the solution i.e. what I need to do to solve the problem or at least what I needed to try next, step back inside to my computer to do that. BTW "productivity" is IMO notoriously difficult to measure in software developers: because people don't know what to measure; and you don't usually have teams and people working on several identical (comparable) software problems; and choosing specific metrics distorts behaviours (joke reference). So arguing via stress (meditation => stress => productivity) might be easier to "prove" than a direct link (meditation => productivity). 

One answer to the question "How did this material world come into existence" might be that the world comes into existence as a result of Pratītyasamutpāda. Part of that theory is The Twelve Nidanas: 

I think that the opening verses of the Dhammapada, for example, make it clear that "revenge" is not a way to appease emnity; and that "the wise" would "cease their quarrels" instead. 

How are the aggregates affected by a person's becoming enlightened or more enlightened? I'm guessing that some aggregates (e.g. "form" perhaps) are not affected, and some are. I'm asking, hoping to better understand what an enlightened state of mind is, or in what way it functions differently. How does "mindfulness" affect the aggregates, what's the change (in the functioning of each aggregate) depending on whether or not you're being mindful? Is this a wrong question -- were/are the "aggregates" only taught in the context of their being something inconstant and not worth attaching to? 

Beware that even describing the advantages of dying is an offence. I quote from this commentary on the Vinaya. Page 74: 

i was robbed ... Thats why my curiosity how to deal with those situations So maybe you should be interested in how you are now, after that fact: 

Another source of advice might be the Vinaya training rules for monks -- their society has lots of rules, which are pretty well defined. If you search that document for the word "accus" (it's there 150 times), it has some advice that you might not expect e.g. on page 137, 

I didn't intend to imply that Arahats are selfish, and sorry it sounded that way. What I meant was that even without or before Buddhism I might think it ordinary and obvious for there to be a yana based on helping others, especially once it's decided that "selflessness" (or anatta) is a good thing (a beneficial doctrine). I'm pretty sure "service" and "ministry" are also Christian ideals (Christians too sometimes puzzle, and sects' doctrines disagree with each other, over how man co-exists with the divine, but being selfless and aspiring to be like Jesus is I think a standard ideal, especially in the early Church). I don't mean that Buddhism is Christianity, just that the yana may be (it seems to be) analagous or at least comparable, and so it doesn't sound like a too-absurd idea, though it is a lofty ideal. Perhaps I'm culturally (i.e. from birth) predisposed to that as an ideal (i.e. taught that it is an ideal), so it doesn't sound absurd nor difficult to accept as doctrine (though when it's examined in detail it may be found to be a cause for wide schisms in Christianity, e.g. here: "every Christian has equal potential to minister for God [...] stands in opposition to the concept of a spiritual aristocracy or hierarchy within Christianity") See also Is there a compassion only Buddhist path?. Finally I think what you're stuck (focused) on is the idea that there can only be one Buddha. But I guess the vow is less "me is going to become Buddha!", and is instead more like "sentient beings (without bounds) need salvation". 

Starting with loving-kindness, even towards a hostile person Then (about 17 pages later) about developing compassion, even towards a robber about to be executed (but if you feel too hostile for compassion, try loving-kindness as previously described) Then try to develop gladness (mudita), for which the advice is as follows: 

There's the story of The Weaver's Daughter from a Dhammapada commentary, where the Teacher delays talking ... 

It's permitted. Monks are allowed "requisites" i.e. the things they need, the little they need: the "four requisites" include food, robes, shelter and medicine (and other small necessities -- needle, razor, water filter, sandals, sometimes a pen, a wristwatch). The types of medicine available (i.e. medical science) has evolved, I don't think that monks are restricted to only using what was considered medicinal 2500 years ago (e.g. "butter" etc.). In some countries, medical needs are e.g. paid for automatically by the state for everyone, in others there might be volunteer medicine for the poor and penniless (which includes monks). There are extensive rules about monks asking -- who they ask, what they ask for, how they ask, whether they wait for it to be offered or wait to be invited, etc. Here is a comment on how this might be managed for Theravada monks in the West -- Discipline and Conventions of Theravada Buddhist Renunciate Communities: 

In any case, that sutta certainly appears to be referring to a state which may happen in the future, and is not just a state which is "only in one's mind" (in the present) -- it says, 

Rational usually isn't without emotion (in my opinion) -- rather it's a structure built on an implicit (often unspecified or unknown) emotional basis, and the emotional basis is often (perhaps invariably) irrational. For example, IMO the following is an example of rational thinking: 

A reason why you may find Buddhism interesting is that it's helpful, useful, and self-evident (by which I mean that it make statements which accord with your own experiences). So take the parts of it that you find helpful. 

Reading this gives me the impression that the curriculum which the Dalai Lama learned was passed down through successive generations/incarnations. The Speech Delivered by His Holiness 14th Dalai Lama to the Second Gelug Conference (Dharamsala, June 12th 2000) says, 

I think I remember, from the literature of the British Empire in India, that people spent time every year in "the hill country": because of the monsoon. Wikipedia's description of the Vinaya says, 

Avoid mind-created reactions to everyday experiences The Madhupindika Sutta explains that we attach meaning to sensory experience, allowing such thoughts to attack oneself. Let go of greed and malice Pursue a goal and enjoy achieving it This type of happiness is called atthi sukha: especially, achieving a worthwhile goal. Look at others' unpleasant actions with compassion Work for others' benefit Live a principled life Accept the inevitability of change as natural law. 

I think 'impulsive' isn't exactly the same as akusala. Let's look at an antonym of 'impulsive', for example "cautious". Or @slova's answer suggests "slow" and "prudent". I imagine that someone who is not impulsive might think twice before speaking, look both ways before crossing the street, save their money instead of spending it ... but that (e.g. hoarding their money) is not necessarily kusala. Or let's consider for example Siddhārtha Gautama's deciding to leave home: that story might (or might not) seem a bit "impulsive", but we shouldn't call it akusala. Being impulsive might be one example of akusala (e.g. losing your temper and suddenly killing someone in anger), but there are other forms of akusala which are not impulsive (e.g. carefully planning a crime for a long time before doing it). Also I hope that there are some forms of being impulsive that are not very akusala (for example impulsively deciding to try to help someone else, being impulsively kind). 

how does it deal with the possible existence of incorporeal entities or does it refute the idea? I think that traditional Buddhist cosmology teaches that there is one category of formless being, i.e. "gods" -- see Formless Realm (Ārūpyadhātu), or Six classes of beings. Some people say that these descriptions (of beings) represent states of mind. Anyway, gods live in a formless realm (so, not the "physical world" you wee asking about). Or there are "ghosts", which may be what you were asking about. Wikipedia says, 

However, IMO, trying to relate it to cellular biology, as you did, is completely off-topic: neither the purpose (use), nor the type of observation (phenomena), for which the theory is or was intended. 

Another description of this fetter is in Thanissaro Bhikkhu's Into the Stream A Study Guide on the First Stage of Awakening, 

This sounds like an illogical tautology - circular reasoning supporting the unconditional Nibanna doctrine. Logically, yes, that does seem to be begging the question. I think it's worth asking, not whether it's a good logical proof for the existence of "the unconditioned", but whether it has an effective pedagogical result, e.g. whether it helps the students to understand emancipation from the conditioned. That reminds me of another fallacy, i.e. Zeno's paradoxes of motion which "prove" that you can never arrive somewhere. Something like that paradox is addressed in the Brahmana Sutta (in that sutta I think that "park" means "monastery"). 

I think a more usual way to formulate your question is how to view "self". For example, seeing "self" as eternal is wrong, but seeing "self" as destructible is wrong. And that answer is more difficult. But I'm pretty sure that the "Middle Way" is part of the answer to that question. 

I think that all khandhas are sankharas, i.e. each khandha is some-things-put-together; for example they include:
