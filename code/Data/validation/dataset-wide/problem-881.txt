Many, if not all, stars will, in their birth phase, have an accretion disk, or circumstellar disk, around them, formed of the material from which the star forms. This disk dissipates in a few million years, both due to the material accreting onto the star, due to material being blown away by radiation pressure, possibly assisted by dust grains, and due to depletion of the material to rocks and planets. Friction in the disk causes it to heat up and be observable in the infrared. After this phase, the star usually won't have an accretion disk. That is, until they die. As you suggest, a star that later on goes supernova can accrete matter from its "reverse shock", i.e. matter that is falling back due to the shockwave hitting the surrounding interstellar medium. More often, though (I think), will the accretion disk be made of material from a companion star: If one star of a binary system turns into a black hole, and then the other star starts to evolve into a red giant, threspassing the Roche limit, it will transfer matter to the black hole. As you say, the black hole's mass isn't stronger than the original star's mass, and thus the gravity at a given distance is also not stronger (in fact it's smaller, since it has blown out most of its mass in the explosion). However, due to its much smaller size, the accreting matter can come much closer before being sucked in. Coming much closer means being in a much steeper gravitational potential and reaching much higher speeds, i.e. being heated to much higher temperatures. Hence, black hole accretion disks can be detected in X-rays 

Firstly, ionized atoms recombine with free electrons. The electron will go to any state, ground or excited, and with various probabilities. The energy of the photon emitted is equal to the energy it would take to remove the electron from the atom (i.e. ionize it again), plus the kinetic energy it had before recombination. And this kinetic energy can have any value (although if it's too large, the probability of recombination decrease). Secondly, even without recombinations, you will not observe only the discrete lines. The reason is that the atoms of the blackbody are not stationary, but move with a ("thermal") velocity $v=\sqrt{k_\mathrm{B}T/m}$, where $k_\mathrm{B}$ is Boltzmann's constant, $T$ is the temperature, and $m$ is the mass of the atom. This motion causes a Doppler broadening of the emitted lines, resulting in a continuous, and Gaussian$^\dagger$, probability distribution. 

1 lightyear, time runs slower by a factor of 1.0000006557, i.e. unnoticeably. 1 astronomical unit (the distance from Earth to the Sun), time runs 17% slower. 1 million km from the surface, time runs slower by a factor of 3.7. 1000 km from the surface, time runs slower by a factor of 111. 1 km from the surface, time runs slower by a factor of ~3500. 1 m from the surface, time runs more than a million times slower. At the surface, time stops. 

tl;dr: In general, smaller galaxies have relatively more dark matter than larger galaxies. The atypical galaxies that you refer to are discussed in the last paragraph. 

The heliocentric velocity $V_\mathrm{H}$ of an object is its velocity wrt. the Sun. When you measure an object's velocity, you measure it in the reference frame of Earth, which revolves around the Sun with ~30 km/s (varying a bit from aphelion to perihelion), so convert to $V_\mathrm{H}$ you need to know the time of the year of the observation (unless the line of sight toward your object is exactly perpendicular to the ecliptic plane), as well as the angle between the line of sight, and the line of sight toward the Sun. This involves a number of sines and cosines that you can find in e.g. Barbieri (2006). If you further want to convert from $V_\mathrm{H}$ to the reference frame in which the Milky Way's center is at rest, the Local Group is at rest, or the Cosmic Microwave Background is isotropic (the "cosmic" frame), then you use the formula you link to, adding a similar term as described above, but instead using the velocity (i.e. speed and direction) of the Sun wrt. to the given frame.

In the intergalactic medium — the most dilute regions of the Universe between the galaxies — as CipherBot writes you'll find roughly one hydrogen per cubic meter, i.e. the density is $\sim10^{-6}\,\mathrm{atoms}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$, or $\sim10^{-30}\,\mathrm{g}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$, or, in terms of energy (since mass and energy are equivalent through $E=mc^2$), $\sim10^{-9}\,\mathrm{erg}^\dagger$. In addition to this, you'll find 5–6 times as much dark matter. Space itself can't really be considered "an object". Nevertheless, even ignoring the normal and dark matter, space does have energy: the so-called dark energy. We don't really know much about it, but we can measure its presence through its effect on the expansion of the Universe. But whereas normal and dark matter decelerates this expansion, dark energy has the opposite effect of accelerating the expansion. And since the energy density of dark energy is more than twice that of the other two components together, it actually dominates the dynamics of the Universe. So, in this regard you can say that space does have gravity, although it's a "negative gravity". This phrasing is a bit misinterpreted, though. The dark energy is thought to be a negative pressure. Pressure has a energy density associated with is, so negative pressure has a negative energy density. $^\dagger$$1\,\mathrm{erg}\equiv10^{-7}\,\mathrm{Joule}$. 

Yes. When light moves through the expanding space, it loses energy and becomes redshifted. As galaxies form, they a emit a lot of UV light, and are often detected from there emission at the so-called Lyman $\alpha$ light, which has a wavelength of 1216 Å. Galaxies began forming just a few hundred million years after the Big Bang. Since then, the Universe has a expanded by more than a factor of 10 in all direction. The wavelength of the light expands by the same factor, and thus a Lyman $\alpha$ photon emitted in this epoch today has a wavelength of $\sim12,000$ Å, or 1.2 $\mu$m, which is in the infrared. 

There is definitely not a catalogue of all meteorites hitting Earth. For instance, the ones falling in desert areas and in the ocean aren't found, and even the ones falling in more populous regions are easily mistaken for normal rocks. Meteorite rate Meteorites come in all sizes, from sand grains to dinosaur-annihilating rocks. The size distribution of these rocks (as well as most other things in space) follow an approximate power law, meaning that the smaller the meteorites you consider, the more often they hit Earth. Estimating the total number of meteorites hitting Earth is difficult, but one study (Bland et al. 1996), looking at the composite of the earth on three arid site and considering the weathering over time, finds that between 36 and 116 meteorites over 10 g hit Earth every year per $10^6\,\mathrm{km}^2$. Multiplying by the surface area of Earth $A_\oplus$, that's roughly 20,000 to 60,000 meteorites hitting Earth per year. Meteor rate UPDATE: You want to know the rate of incoming meteors, i.e. all rocks that hit Earth's atmosphere. By definition, a meteorite is a meteor that lands on the surface of Earth. Before it enters the atmosphere and becomes a meteor, you can call it asteroid, meteoroid, rock, pebble, or dust grain, depending on its size and your mood. Taylor et al. (1996) have monitored incoming meteors with the AMOR radar in New Zealand and detected in one year 350,000 trails from incoming meteors of size 10–100 $\mu$m vaporizing in ~100 km's height. I don't know exactly how large an area AMOR monitors, but from simple trigonometry, and as an order-of-magnitude estimate, if the events happen in $h \sim 100\,\mathrm{km}$'s height, the radar can "see" a distance $d=\sqrt{h^2+2R_\oplus h} \sim 1100\,\mathrm{km}$, and thus covers an area $A\sim4\times10^6\,\mathrm{km}^2$. Thus, again multiplying by $A_\oplus$, this amounts to the order of 40 to 50 million meteors per year. Killer meteor rate and the Sudan asteroid The meteors discussed above is probably not what you had in mind. As mentioned, the bulk of these "rocks" are actually more like sand grains. So what is the rate of devastating killer-rocks from space? Brown et al. (2002) fit a power law to several different data sets (LINEAR, Spacewatch, NEAT and others), and find that the number $N$ of meteors above a diameter $D$ in meters is roughly $$ N(>D) \simeq 37 D^{-2.7}. $$ The following plot is from their paper, with the long black line showing their fit, and the short black lines indicating the uncertainty: 

First of all, if there were no dark matter (DM), you wouldn't ask this question, since structures — including galaxies, stars, planets, and you — wouldn't have had the time to form in the early Universe before it had expanded too much for gravitational collapse to occur. But let's use magic and make the galaxies anyway: 

$^\dagger$Unless the Universe contains a yet unknown substance that is able to halt the acceleration. This is entirely possible, but in this answer I consider only a well-behaving Universe that acts according to current knowledge. 

You're asking two different, but somewhat related questions: One has to do with a practical way of describing the expansion of the Universe; the other has to do with a way of dealing with our ignorance of the exact expansion rate of the Universe. I will answer your specific question in the last paragraph. Comoving and physical coordinates A comoving coordinate system is one in which particles that don't move through space have fixed coordinates, even is that space is expanding (or contracting, or otherwise warping). In contrast, the particles' physical coordinates are the actual distances you would measure between them if you froze space and started laying out measuring rods. Expansion, scale factor, and redshift Cosmological distances are often measured in megaparsec (Mpc), i.e. one million parsec, or roughly 3.3 million lightyears. Our Universe expands, and we describe this expansion not by its size (because we don't know how large it is, or even if its finite), but by a scale factor $a$, which is defined to be equal to $1$ today. Thus, in the past, when everything was half the distance from each other compared to today, we had $a=0.5$. Because light moving through an expanding space is redshifted, light from a certain time when $a$ had a certain value, is redshifted ("stretched") by a certain factor. It turns out that if we observe some light to have been redshifted by a particular value of $z$, it must have been emitted at a time when the scale factor was $a = 1/(1+z)$. Definition of comoving coordinates Comoving coordinates are defined to coincide with the physical coordinates today. That is, if the physical distance to galaxy "CLASH 2882" is 3.4 Gpc, so is the comoving distance, always was, and always will be (save for a very small movement through space, but this can be neglected). The light we receive from CLASH 2882 is redshifted to twice its emitted wavelength, so $z=1$, and $a=1/(1+1)=0.5$. At earlier times, when $a$ was, say, $0.75$, $0.5$, and $0.1$, the physical distance to CLASH 2882 was 2.5 Gpc, 1.7 Gpc, and 340 Mpc, but its comoving distance was always 3.3 Gpc. The use of comoving coordinates Comoving coordinates are practical for instance when comparing properties of something that may or may not evolve with time, but also change with the size of space, e.g. densities. One example is the number density of galaxies. If galaxies had just been around forever, without evolving, then their number density would decrease with time proportionally to $1/a^3$. To study how galaxies form, evolve, merge, etc. it is helpful to factor this out, i.e. to use comoving coordinates. If the number density in comoving coordinates change, it must be due to some "real", astrophysical effect, not just because of cosmological expansion. Another example is the density of neutral hydrogen, in $\mathrm{g}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. In physical units, if nothing happened this density would decrease as $1/a^3$, whereas in comoving units it would be constant. Nevertheless, when $a$ was about $0.1$ the global, comoving density dropped several orders of magnitudes, evident of a physically significant process referred to as the Epoch of Reionization. Converting between physical and comoving units So, if you want to convert between physical and comoving units, just remember that the comoving coordinates factor out the expansion of the Universe, and you have, for distances, $$ d_\mathrm{physical} = a d_\mathrm{comoving} = \frac{d_\mathrm{comoving}}{1+z}, $$ and consequently, for densities, $$ n_\mathrm{physical} = a^3 d_\mathrm{comoving} = \frac{d_\mathrm{comoving}}{(1+z)^3}, $$ Little $h$ The little $h$ commonly seen in length units (and units derived hereof) is a way of factoring out the exact magnitude of the expansion rate $H_0$ of the Universe. It is defined by $$ H_0 = 100h\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}. $$ That is, if $H_0=70\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, then $h=0.7$, and if $H_0=67.81\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, then $h=0.6781$. The use of $h$ is something of a reminiscence from the times when we only knew that $H_0$ was of the order of $50$–$100\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, and factoring out the exact value allowed people assuming different values to more easily compare their results. It may be argued — and has in fact been (Croton 2013) — that today, where $H_0$ is known rather precisely to be around $70\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, $h$ only acts to confuse. It does, however, seem to prevail, especially in numerical, cosmological simulations. $h$ notation The way you express your question, namely that you
