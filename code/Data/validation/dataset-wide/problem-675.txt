First, regarding the crank's bottom bracket recommendation: The crank uses a square taper bottom bracket spindle, and would not be compatible with the Shimano Hollowtech II BB that may be currently in the bike. You could swap out to a BB-UN50 or BB-UN70 from Shimano in a 68x115mm size, to fix the crank/BB compatibility issue if that is the case. That leaves the tooth difference question. The first thing to check is the tooth capacity of the front derailleur. The bike in question uses a Shimano Tiagra, 10-speed front derailleur. Shimano has a Product Info website which provides specifications and compatibility information by part type, model number and product series. The relevant information for a Tiagra Double Front Derailleur is listed under the part number (which is engraved on the back of the actual front derailleur), in this case, the FD-4600 or FD-4700. The information we are looking for is the maximum tooth difference between large and small chain rings. This is identified as maximum capacity. As you can see in the image below, the maximum capacity (tooth differential) is 16 teeth. That means that a 42/26 should just be in the range of use for a Tiagra 10 speed double front derailleur. 

The best place I've found is Henry James Bicycle supply. They make frame building jigs, and supply most boutique US based frame builders. Ceeway is a good choice in Europe. Some lugs may need to be custom cast, or modified, depending on the head tube and seat tube angles you choose. The fork rake will need to be fairly slack to match that style. 

With all respect, you should look at a new bike, or a used one which is far more current than the one you've got now. If you are uncomfortable riding it, feel unsafe, or it requires more skill than you have to ride it comfortably, then get one that is comfortable and safe for you. You can buy a new, basic mountain bike, hybrid. or urban bike for about $500 US dollars, which will be more comfortable, and outperform what you have now. To recondition that bike to any real standard, especially if you want to modernize gears, or brakes, will cost you at least half that, and likely more. And you'll still have a bike which is missing years of design and performance improvements. There are definitely old bikes which are classics, and well worth the cost and effort of reconditioning thoroughly, but that doesn't fall into that category, especially in it's current condition. 

Physical lung capacity -- This a measurement of the actual cubic feet of airspace available in your lungs. This is a genetic factor, which cannot be trained up. Ability to transfer oxygen in your blood stream. Increased red blood cell counts mean more carriers available to transport oxygen to the active muscles in your body. This can be increased through exercise or drugs. The latter course, drugs, while common will bar you from any competition, and is both dangerous and illegal. 

What your bike can handle is usually more a matter of your skill level than it is the bike, at least to a certain point. When you watch mountain bike videos, you will see guys on hardtail "XC bikes" take drops much larger than 2 feet. BUT, they have skill, lots of practice, and likely many broken bikes or bones, or both in their past. Don't worry about the bike you have. Ride it, learn as much as you can, and when it begins limiting your rides, replace it with something more suitable. Starting off on a hardtail offroad is the best way to learn to skillfully pick a line, and be smooth on your bike. Buying a longer travel machine too early can stunt your growth as a rider, IMHO. Plus, you already bought it. The time to do the research was before you swiped your credit card. :) 

Repeat as required. If more is required, sand the face of the brake pad with a fine grit sandpaper. Reattach noodle. (Everybody always forgets that part.) Hope that helps. 

It is mainly aimed at the DH or freeride market, as it is a heavy, but very tough piece of kit. The gearing is not suited for XC or endurance rides, for that reason. As you can see in the Anatomy View below, the gear change is accomplished not in the Bottom bracket, but in the chain guide. 

No bike, no matter how good, is absolutely silent. It's possible that this bike needs to be tuned better, but more likely, it's simply the fact that it is Shimano's most basic 10 speed components and what is for Cannondale a more basic alloy frame. I would suggest taking it to a different LBS for an opinion on what the real problem is, or if there is one. It could be a loose or dry bottom bracket, headset, hubs, chain, chain ring bolts, saddle, seat post or pretty much any other moving part on the bike. I hope that is helpful. 

The best bet for old Campy Hoods is EBay. The hoods you are looking for are the EC-R500 Silicone Rubber hoods, I believe. One set here: $URL$ 

Here is a link to a PDF from Cane Creek detailing most other styles of headsets fitment for non-traditional options. These have become very common also. 

Opening it is simple. Remove the grip, grasp the portion of the shifter that turns to shift, and rotate it back like you are shifting, while pulling it towards the center of the bar. Putting it back together is not simple, and will likely not happen without assistance. Ask your LBS to show you the procedure if you want to learn. If not, ask them to fix it. It will like require replacing the pawl spring (snoopy spring) inside it, which creates the click, and holds the shifter to a particular gear. It may require replacing the shifter body, depending on what is broken inside. 

For not much more than that ($600 dollars), you could put a new Tiagra 10 speed group on the bike. So in my opinion, no, that is not a good price for those components. Even if they were unused, it would be a high price. You are the only one who can make that value judgement, though. Do you want the vintage look and feel? Are the components unused? Do you think it's worth close to the same money as a newer, better quality group set? Then it may be. 

What tools are required to begin building a frame? Are there DIY substitutes for any of them? Are there things that aren't requirements, but simplify the process enough to be worth the cost? Aside from classes at a place like UBI, how do you start learning what is required to practice this art form?
