Therefore, the TbA does not necessarily contain more rows than the number of open branches in TtA. Proof: (1) is trivial but we can prove that the number of open branches are unbounded, i.e. (2), by induction on the disjunction operator like so: 

So there's a soul which is a property of the body, but we're not sure how this relates to the nature of the particular thing or whether or not humans as well as dogs have a soul. The soul is matter and it seems to die with the body (just how it happens in Epicurus). I think Epicurus' argument is pretty airtight. If you believe that there is no existence after death, fearing what happens during the state of death is irrational. Even stranger is the fact that Socrates actually embraced death (as death would bring one's soul closer to the forms). So we can actually have a position where the soul is immortal and death is actually welcomed. 

Sometimes, primes are used (you can also mix and match, but staying consistent is always a good idea). Here's the set of all blue pens possible: 

The truth table TbA for A will have 2n rows. The truth tree TtA for A has an unbounded number of open branches. 

Primary source reading: Socratic Puzzles. Conclusion - How far is too far? Looking at the example above, we see various milestones of coercion: 

It means "metaphysics". He uses the same terminology as Aristotle. In modern (and more specific terms), we can also construe it as "ontology"; that is, the study of being is the most basic ("first") philosophy. 

In the analytic tradition, philosophical arguments consist of clearly stated premises and logically sound conclusions. Some (already noted) attempts to locate in Rand's work such specific premises and conclusions show that her positions on several important points (e.g. causation and free will) are self-contradictory and inconsistent. This makes her conclusions irrelevant to the philosophical discourse in which she appears to have been attempting to participate. So in this way, the answer to your above question is a resounding "YES!"; a lack of argumentation entails a lack of rigor in argumentation. Upon reflection, I realize that one could respond here by saying that Rand was engaged in a more Continental approach to philosophy. Consider her tendency to employ fiction to "make her point" – a strategy (as previously mentioned in another answer) employed by Sartre and Camus, among other Continentals. Reading her this way, Rand's work could be seen as having a place within some larger historical philosophical discourse. However, her well-documented ideological struggle against Marxism undermines her own argument again here; the Marxist dialectic underpins the Continental approach to philosophy. If we are to take Rand's conclusions seriously, which is to say that if we take her particular anti-Marxism to be the point she is making, then she is using the Marxist dialectic to completely disavow Marxism, thus ending the dialectic. There are two problems with this. First, her work would be little more than her bid to be the "the champion of all philosophical discourse", and second, there are still WAY too many questions left unanswered for us to stop doing philosophy. So frankly, she has written nothing particularly philosophically interesting or compelling. 

With that said, it's difficult to see who was or wasn't (exactly) a monist or dualist (in the Cartesian sense) in ancient philosophy. Thales and Empedocles are particularly tricky. They are both Physicalists (this is a very loose categorization), but Empedocles mentions the transmigration of souls. Aristotle is also difficult to place. He writes (in De Anima): 

Note that I use the term "liberal" in the context of philosophical liberalism, and not in any political sense. 

Probably the major (non-ancient) innovator of logic pre-Boole/Frege was Peter of Spain. He lived during the 13th century and wrote the Tractatus. This was not only a rehashing of ancient logics, but was also the basis of a tradition that would last almost 600 years. Since the Tractatus was ubiquitously used as a logic textbook for centuries, I would say that Peter of Spain probably made a more lasting impact on the logical landscape than Aristotle himself. To find out more, I strongly suggest reading Peter of Spain: Summaries of Logic. It is written by three heavy-weights of Medieval philosophy: Calvin Normore, Brian Copenhaver, and Terrence Parsons. For what it's worth, I've had the honor of taking classes with all three of them and saying they are brilliant is an understatement. 

We already provided several counterexamples to the claim that a truth table necessarily contains more rows than the number of open branches in the completed tree, but we can generalize this phenomenon (at least in the disjunctive case) by noticing that the truth tree always branches at a disjunction. If there is no contradiction on one of the branches, the branch will remain open. 

This highlights another frustration some academic philosophers might have regarding Ayn Rand. She relies on absolute self-certainty where she should be relying on well-reasoned arguments. One problem here is doing this often resembles well-thought-out, consistent philosophy, but in terms of actual philosophy, it amounts to nothing more than polemics and screeds. From her writings, all that can be logically deduced are her opinions, yet I have no doubt that Rand dislikes Marxism, nor do I doubt her love of Capitalism. Another problem is that assuming the certainty of your conclusions is simply poorly-executed philosophy – every philosopher must be willing to accept that they could be wrong about their conclusions, or else they are not doing philosophy. Again, her work is thus philosophically uninteresting. But if your thoughts are provoked by her writing, that's a good thing. I recommend taking some time to sketch out her arguments and see for yourself if her conclusions actually follow from her premises. 

This is the case because Rand offered very few philosophical arguments. I actually do not know of any particular arguments she did offer, but I will assume that she at least attempted to offer some. 

The type/token distinction appears to be generally explained in terms of objects. A given Honda Accord is, e.g., a token of of the type "Honda Accord". However, the literature I have read seems to do little to explain how such a distinction could/should be applied to events. Can anyone direct me to resources that discuss how to apply the type/token distinction to events? 

Are all not non-coercive according to Aquinas. and are threats and Aquinas doesn't believe threats can possibly be coercive. is not a threat (your company is losing money as we speak!) but it's non-violent so, again, it's not coercive. If you run a government and subscribe to this kind of philosophy, you're in luck. You can do just about anything. Violent torture, punching someone in the face, or otherwise being violent while attempting to undermine someone's 'inclination of the will' is the only way of being coercive. Raising gas prices is the least of your worries. Primary source reading: Summa Theologica. Hobbes, Locke, Kant, Mill - Justice and the role of the state Hobbes, Locke, and Kant mainly thought of coercion as a tool of the state that ought to be conducive to justice. Even Aquinas thought that a governor needed certain coercive powers to ensure order. Hobbes, in particular, thought it to be an essential part of government: 

All four (also Bentham and others) believed, like Aquinas, that a 'covenant from fear was valid,' so fear is, therefore, not coercive. The limits of coercion seem to align closely to what Aquinas laid out. Mill, however, argued that coercion consists of more than violence and threats thereof. He made several leaps: 

The concept of a WFF (well formed formula) is a formal one and deals with syntactic validity. Any logic you pick will have a concept of WFF (just how any written language you pick has a concept of spelling). If, in that logic, you provide a deduction that contains lines that are not WFFs, then it's easy to see that it would be weaker than using WFFs. Not only would it be weaker, but it would be nonsense. (I'm not sure how Godel's Incompleteness Theorem fits here.) 

The razor hasn't been appropriately deployed here. Where you say "simpler one" you really mean that the razor would have you pick between hypotheses A and B in virtue of the number of explanatory posits they individually put forth. Specifically, if there are more explanatory posits in A than in B, and A and B both satisfactorily explain all of the relevant observations, then B is simpler than A. 

Regarding the truth of physicalism WRT the existence of Pzombies, in order to reach the conclusion that "physicalism is false" from the premises given, then it must be part of the definition of "physicalism" that all mental states are identical with and reducible to physical states. It's this necessary property implicit in the definition of the term that would make physicalism false (if you buy such arguments) because the Pzombie counts as a conceivably possible counterexample to the universal claims of the physicalist. However, if one offered a more nuanced definition for physicalism, something like "To have mental state X is to be in physical state Y" such that "physical state Y" is functionally defined, then non-physicalist arguments for and from Pzombies become significantly more difficult to maintain. One philosopher who argues for at least the possible existence of Pzombies is (famously) Chalmers. 

I'm going to try not to step on any toes here. No matter how you slice it, the content of your belief is almost undoubtedly not the "resulting distribution" of a "credence-distribution over the two hypotheses." It's easy to see why it can't be: when someone asks you if you believe A or B, your answer will never be "the resulting distribution of a credence-distribution over the two hypotheses." That may describe how you came to hold the belief you hold, but that process is not the content of that belief. 

Let's look at the last line marked with an asterisk. will yield per Table 1. Similarly, as well as will also yield per Table 1. So, no matter how we decide to commute, we will have to deal with an and the remaining . And will always yield a per Table 1. This is why we observe the odd-even alternation of truth values when all operands are true. It turns out that you don't want to use a in examples like the one in your OP. What you actually want to do is something like or (via DeMorgans) . There is no logical connective that does this since this would require an n-ary connector, e.g. something like which would only work as a function in FOL. Here is an interesting paper discussing the ternary exclusive or. 

is not a number because happens to be the (a?) unit. And a number, by definition, is a multitude of units. So clearly then, the two are distinct. See Metaphysics 1052b35, Posterior Analytics 72a22, and Topics 108b30. To see why, for example, is a number whereas is a unit, see Metaphysics 1039a15. 

Not to mention that the question reminds me of Bertrand's paradox in which our good friend Bertie tried to make a clever probability paradox out of the ambiguity of the question. Read E.T. Jaynes' reply in The Well-Posed Problem in which he argued for a principle he defined as "maximum ignorance" (incidentally, I've been using a similar form of the argument). Read more about how it defeats Russel's paradox on Wikipedia and elsewhere.
