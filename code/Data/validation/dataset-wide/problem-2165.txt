Every manager should expect to get some advice and direction from their experienced employees, that's a mild form "managing up" but there are some situations that I've seen that go beyond that: 

Most bad managers I've seen were a mix of 2 and 3 and that seems to be what you are facing, everyone is different so I can only offer a few suggestions and leave it to you to judge and adapt: 

It sounds like he thinks you are approachable and knowledgable, this is generally a good thing. If you want to handle this gently then you're going to have to drill a little deeper and figure out the root of the reason he comes to you. Here are a few things that I've seen (or done) and some suggestions that might help: 

They probably just want to know if you are a family man. You are perhaps more likely to be settled, and maybe more likely to be reliable if you have family responsibilities. They are probably interested in what your wife does in order to gauge your character. For example if your wife were a stripper that might count against you. In the US it's now illegal to ask such questions because it could introduce prejudice against people with alternative lifestyles. To my knowledge there are no such laws in SA. 

Those may or may not dissuade future borrowing, but at least it will make it so you'll WANT people to steal your chair. I'd check for tacks before you sit down in case someone retaliates. 

The chain of command has been bypassed, which is something a manager can do a lot easier than an employee, what I'm suggesting is that you act (to the best of your ability) like it hasn't and loop your boss in before (and probably after) the meeting with your boss's boss. 

This is about more than just negotiating a salary. The VP will want to talk to you directly, he'll want to get a get a feel for how you do things that he (she?) can't get from an email exchange. This isn't cold calling. When he hires you, he's bringing you into his business. An uncommunicative or unskilled employee can drag down a software company. He's trusting you with a lot. This is not a competition, you're joining his team. You still don't need to agree to a salary over the phone. Take the call, get the offer, showcase your skills a little, then rather than accepting it right away, say "can I just think about it for a short while". Then email him back later with a counter offer, or to accept what he offered you. 

You need to Influence, not impose. A ban is a BAD idea. Your employees are not children and you don't need to manage their eating habits. Are you willing to fire an employee or dock their pay (until they leave for a better job) for eating at their desk? Don't implement a rule you aren't really willing to enforce, no one will respect it or you. If you believe that this is the best policy then you need to be a leader and influence them to your point of view: 

Consider, are you purchasing time, or are you purchasing results. If you are purchasing time your contractors become time salesmen. Their incentive is now to work as slowly as they can reasonably get away with to maximise the value of each hour. Their other incentive is to produce unmaintainable products so further hours will be required in the future. If you are purchasing results their incentive is to work as quickly as they can (and as well as they can to improve future productivity) so they can get their work done and get paid. As a contractor I prefer to work to a fixed price fixed spec. Being a time salesman is no fun at all. 

I think you have a valid concern, but that the benefits of putting relevant coding experience on your resume out-weigh the chance you'll have someone reading your resume that will count game playing against you. Violating a game's ToS is probably not something that is going to count against you unless you directly profited by that action. A tech guy that plays video games is not going to be a shock to anyone familiar with tech guys. I would describe your bot in user interface terms instead of gaming terms. Ex. Gamer = User, Game = Program, Navigate the Game = Navigate the Program's User Interface. This will eliminate anyone that is filtering resumes from removing you from consideration due to your gaming. If you get to the interview stage just make sure to keep the focus on the code and don't talk about the game more than you have to, avoid any in-game jargon. Evaluate how they respond and direct the conversation accordingly. If you can talk about it professionaly and not come off as a game-crazed geek you should be OK in most cases - good luck! 

I did about 2 weeks worth of work on a website about a year ago for a client. It was a straightforward server migration, plus a bit of CSS. The client was happy, I invoiced, he paid. A couple of weeks ago, I was contacted by a London based outsourcing agency. They have taken over the site and want to make some changes to it. This is all fine, I don't care who works on the site. The trouble is, the agency is technically hopeless. They keep calling me asking how to do trivial things. For example: how do I connect my GUI to the database, or how do I change this bit of html. It's not a complex site, it's just a bog-standard Rails instance hosted on Heroku. A standard Rails stack, any Rails dev could work on it. They're always polite, but they will not stop calling me. They have full admin access and all the passwords. My instinct is always to teach and to help, but really I don't think I am helping because they keep asking the same questions. My dilemma: 

The more prone to being a leader you are, the easier this will be to change from the inside, but this is really your manager's responsibility and that should be your first move (unless the manager is straight out of a Dilbert cartoon). 

It's probably a combination of several of the above and you'll have to adjust your strategy accordingly. 

If nothing else this will make your chair easier to find again, but I think people will be less likely to grab your chair once it's obviously yours. 

Re-negotiate. Tell the company you are interested, but you can't accept the 2 year lock in. Perhaps also attempt to negotiate a higher salary. You can then accept the job, but you have an escape hatch if it turns out to be as bad as you have heard. If they turn you down you have lost nothing, and perhaps gained some confidence. If the negative stories are exaggerated and they give you what you have asked for, you have the job, plus a little more money and a good negotiating position. 

New Manager - The employees have to train the manager and that puts them in charge for a litle while. Apathetic Manager - A manager that could do a better job and just doesn't so that the employees have to pick up the slack to keep their company / group running. Unskilled Manager - An ineffective manager doesn't focus on the right things may delegate real management to the employees I've seen this done intentionally and unintentionally. 

I'd advise a heavy dose of tact and honesty here, and it that needs to start with a conversation with your boss about being allowed to alter the existing framework. Again, let me state to do this tactfully! Here are some ideas that might work:
