They are related in that UAC relies on the existence of ACLs (and all the related security apparatus) in order to function. UAC works by removing (technically speaking, disabling) the Administrators token from non-elevated processes. This means that if the ACL for a particular file or folder only allows access to Administrators, non-elevated processes won't have access. That's why an installer can't write to Program Files without elevating first. EDIT: See this article for more information about UAC. In particular: "When an administrator logs on to a computer that is running Windows 7 or Windows Vista, the user is assigned two separate access tokens. Access tokens, which contain a user's group membership and authorization and access control data, are used by the Windows operating system to control what resources and tasks the user can access." I suppose you could argue that UAC depends on the Windows authorization model, of which ACLs are only a particular component, and that therefore UAC is not related to ACLs. I don't think that's a useful way of looking at it. Let me put it this way: if there weren't any ACLs, UAC would be pointless. You should also read this article which addresses some common misconceptions about UAC, and in particular the misconception that it is a security feature: "The primary goal of UAC is to enable more users to run with standard user rights. However, one of UAC's technologies looks and smells like a security feature: the consent prompt. Many people believed that the fact that software has to ask the user to grant it administrative rights means that they can prevent malware from gaining administrative rights." 

When I first try to debug it, it appears that in , there were no MyInstance folder one the second node... First question: is that normal ? So I decided to copy/paste this folder from node1 -> node2. Service started good after a reboot of node2. The day after, I decided to move my Instance back to node1 -> OK. I now move it to node2, error. And I got the error mentionned above.. I can't start this service one node2, but everything is OK on node1. I've compare regedit from both, and there are exactly the same. No luck with EventViewer, so I really don't know how to troubleshoot this problem. EDIT: With SQL Server Configuration manager, Node1 I can see MyInstance but not on Node2 ... if it can help. 

According to technet this is how to solve : "The domain controller declined the Kerberos ticket created by Web Application Proxy. Verify that the configuration of the Web Application Proxy and the backend application server are configured correctly, especially the SPN configuration. Make sure the Web Application Proxy is domain joined to the same domain as the domain controller to ensure that the domain controller establishes trust with Web Application Proxy.Make sure that the time and date configuration on the Web Application Proxy and the domain controller are synchronized." But I don't really know why they told me to join the WAP server in the domain, as this server should be in D.M.Z and in WORKGROUP. Date and time on the WAP server were not good, so I modified it, now its ok. I didn't join the server to the domain, and SPN is set with the domain account that is running AppPool of my SP Site. I double check DNS, HOSTS files, certificates, accounts ... I can't find any error. I'm wondering : should I need to add any account the right to read private key on my wildcard certificate on the WAP Server ? On ADFS Server, only adfs service account has read right on the certificate (pv key), on SP only domain account that is used to run app pool has right to read on the certificate's pv key. Ask for more details if needed. 

OK, since you only want to reduce your access rights (rather than actually running as Peter per se) you may have some options. In Windows 7 (and Windows Server 2008 R2) the task scheduler supports this directly (via the "Do not store password" option) but I don't think there is any built-in equivalent for Windows Server 2003. Running the task this way on a different machine probably won't help because you don't get network access. It can be done in software, though, even on Windows 2003, via the CreateRestrictedToken Win32 function. A Google search found a piece of software called ulimitnt which appears be able to do what you want (via the option). Note that I've never used this program so I can't vouch for its reliability. Using this approach, the script only has access to files that grant access to both local system and to Peter. (Note that the local system account implicitly belongs to the Administrators group, so if Administrators has access that will be sufficient.) 

Ok, I troubleshoot networks related problems, and port 135 was blocked between servers. Now everything's OK ! 

I installed AD LDS on a W2012R2. Everything is working fine. Now, I want to create new Roles, to grant to groups permissions to create/modify/delete users in a certain container. (I used this article) For example, this is my instance : OU=extra,DC=domain,DC=local |--CN=LostAndFound |--CN=Roles |--|----CN=Administrators (Created by default) |--|----CN=Readers (Created by default) |--|----CN=Users (Created by default) |--|----CN=AdminGroupCustomer1 (Created by myself) |--OU=Users (Created by default, I just chose the name and type) |--|----CN=Customer1 |--|----|--CN=Users |--|----|--|--CN=user1 |--|----|--CN=Groups |--|----|--|--CN=group1 |--|----|--CN=Administrators |--|----|--|--CN=Admin1 |--|----CN=Customer2 |--|------| ... I want to permit to AdminGroupCustomer1 group the permissions to modify anything in OU=Customer1, but nothing on Customer2. So this is what I did : 1°) Add AdminCustomer1 (which is a AD user in fact ), to AdminGroupCustomer1 group. OK 2°) Add AdminGroupCustomer1 (which is the Group role) to Readers group role. OK (Is that really needed ? ... I don't think so). 3°) Execute the following DSACLS.EXE command to grant permission on Customer1's container to AdminGroupCustomer1 group: 

In the Group Policy Management Console I am attempting to delegate the "Link GPOs" right, but after selecting the group to delegate the access to and the "This container and all child containers" option, I am receiving the error message "The request is not supported". Here's a screenshot of the same error on the Microsoft Forums. In that case, the user was attempting to remove a delegation. What causes this error and how can the problem be resolved? 

After upgrading Java to version 8u171 the Java KVM client provided by my Dell BMC's web interface stopped working. The only error message is "Connection failed." I'm using the BMC on a PowerEdge C6220, but other models may also be affected. What's going on and how can I fix it? 

The admin machine must have the Windows 10 SDK installed and needs direct internet access. It does not need to be running Windows 10 itself. You may then wish to combine the logs together into a single file: 

Thanks to @TomTom with his above comment. This is the explanation and how to solve (link) : I deployed VM with template, and then join WSUS almost at the same time. So both Server (1 & 2) got the same WSUS ID. So we need to reset this ID and renew the request to the WSUS Server. 

Is there a way (PowerShell would be nice) to copy a user (I need sAMAccountName) and his password, from one domainA (forestA) to domainB (forestB). All Active Directory servers are on LAN and this is a test environment, but if this works, gonna put script on the production. I already know how to get a user and attributes from powershell, but I can't find anything on password. EDIT : I must avoid trust relationship between domains 

I'm running a WSUS within 2012 R2. I have two server, let's say Server1 and Server2. Both GPO are configured to use my WSUS server. When I connect to WSUS server and launch the Update Services MMC, in the category "All Computers" I can see Server1, but not Server2. When I run on Server2, the Update Services MMC shows up Server2, but no more Server1 ... I don't understand. Those two servers are VMware VM deployed from a template, they are both in the same domain as WSUS server. All VMs ping each other, no network related problem. Any ideas ? 

This error occurs when the user has existing permissions on the Active Directory OU that the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC) doesn't know how to deal with. It should be noted that group policy delegations are really just permissions on the OU, the GPMC just provides a simplified interface to make the necessary permissions changes easier. You can use Active Directory Users and Computers to check the permissions on the OU. You will need to enable "Advanced Features" from the View menu in order to see the Security tab for an OU object, and you will need to choose "Advanced" to see the detailed permissions list. In my case, the group in question had been explicitly granted "Read" access to the OU, which must have been added by mistake at some point since it is redundant. In the linked question on the Microsoft Forums, the user was attempting to change delegation for the Domain Admins group which by default has Full Control on all OUs. In my case, since the existing Read permission didn't need to be there, I removed it using Active Directory Users and Computers. I was then able to use the GPMC to add the delegation I wanted. The user in the linked Microsoft Forums question could have removed the Full Control permission for Domain Admins the same way, which would have also removed the group policy delegation as a side-effect. (Whether this is a sensible change is another matter!) In other cases, if the extra permissions cannot be removed, you can grant the necessary delegation directly in Active Directory Users and Computers rather than via the Group Policy Management Console. If you want to grant the "Link GPOs" delegation then the necessary access permissions are "Read gPLink", "Write gPLink", "Read gPOptions", and "Write gPOptions". Once the change is made, refreshing the view in the Group Policy Management Console should show the newly created delegation. 

We're using a windows 2012 R2 server as DHCP/DNS/AD. I would like to use a tool, that enables me to retrieve every IP addresses that are in use, and DNS register and/or hostnames associated with. Plus, would be great if it can automatically discover if there is something new. I thought using IPAM from Microsoft, but unfortunately it does not populate automatically... Is the best way the following : Writing several scripts (PowerShell) that retrieve DHCP/DNS/AD informations, and store it as an html file ? I'm sure you guys, know a basic tool that does the job. Tia. 

So my Customer AD will only store credentials to log in SharePoint for customers, no more rights. And my Internal AD Users (or some of them) will be able to create new Customer Account. But also, some customers will be able to create new account or at least ask for. Ask if I'm not understandable enough. The idea is simple: best way to handle employee AD account (no changes on the AD server), handle customer accounts, handle authentication all with SharePoint. 

Microsoft Windows does not prohibit the underscore in the name of a computer. Some system administrators, either not knowing or not caring about RFC952, use underscores in the name of a computer that is connected to the internet, and either put this name in the DNS explicitly or allow it to be published via dynamic DNS. There's nothing particularly strange about these names. Examples might be JOHNS_COMPUTER or ACCOUNTING_DEPT_PC1. 

Test Procedure The machine I'm experimenting with is PowerEdge 2970 with a DRAC 5, Hardware Version A00, Firmware Version 1.60 (11.03.03). The BMC Firmware Version is 2.50. The NIC Selection is set to Shared and the NIC is enabled. The static IP address is 192.168.241.100 and the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0. There is no gateway on our management network so I have that set to 0.0.0.0. Auto negotiation is on. None of the other settings are configured. With the management network connected to LOM1 (and the LAN connected to LOM2) I can both ping the DRAC and log into the DRAC web interface from a production machine with access to the management network. (IP address 192.168.241.102/255.255.255.0.) I cannot ping the DRAC from a machine on the LAN (mis)configured to use 192.168.241.29/255.255.255.0, even after clearing the ARP cache. With the management network connected to LOM2 (and the LAN connected to LOM1) I can neither ping the DRAC from the management network machine or connect to it via the web interface. Clearing the ARP cache had no effect. I can ping the DRAC and access the web interface from the machine on the LAN. In both cases the operating system on the 2970 has full network connectivity on both the LAN and the management network (once the network interfaces are appropriately configured). I also tried using WinDump to look for arp replies on both the management network and the LAN. In both cases, I saw arp replies from the DRAC only on the network that LOM1 was plugged into. 

Using a 2-nodes cluster 2008R2 Failover Cluster. A new clustered instance was created (I double checked it's clustered). Instance was installed on node1. When we try to move it to node2, it failed. SQL Server service won't start saying : 

I set up ADFS and WAP on server 2012 R2 in order to login into SharePoint 2013. I follow several how-to, and all seems fine except one thing : When I log into ADFS form, its ok, then I land on a blank page. So I had a look at WAP logs, and it returns these two error messages : 

ID=13019 Web Application Proxy cannot retrieve a Kerberos ticket on behalf of the user because of the following general API error: The name provided is not a properly formed account name.
