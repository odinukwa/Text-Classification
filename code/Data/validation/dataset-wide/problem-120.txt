They made humans magical, but none knows details Humans were an unmagical species in a world full of residual magic, left over perhaps by the elves... These creatures transform magic into biological existence, releasing a tiny fraction of magically saturated air. Upon inhaling that, humans slowly develop magical abilities. Nobody knows this, but it has been observed that the presence of the Grindlequark (or whatever it is called) greatly benefits spell casters. It is even rumoured that total isolation from grindlequarks for one year and one day renders one unmagical. This is all the more true of magically imbued artefacts, which abound in the library. Unfortunately for some dark wizards, the practice of preparing Tumbleweed-Grindlequark stew has not enhanced magical power in any palpable manner. But many still cherish it for its reputation and thick, savoury quality. Therefore the library not only doesn't dream of exterminating the Grindlequark, but novices are actually assigned to individual Grindlequarks, vouching for their safety and beckoning to their every whim. The creatures have proved remarkably adept in discrediting novices who don't guess the wishes they communicate through guestures and grimacing... If there is a competing race, eager to render humans unmagical again, they might even kill Grindlequarks in the wild, so the keeping of sanctuaries would be all the more important. 

LOTS. Let's forget for a second that we're talking about creatures, and just assume that our focus is Von Neumann machines. Quoting Wikipedia, 

He woke and found himself lying in bed. At first he thought that he had slept late, after a long unpleasant dream that still hovered on the edge of memory. He opened his eyes to an unknown ceiling. 'We are in the House of Healing, Dae son of Aik,' he heard a familiar voice say. 'We're back home.' 'Hidr!...' he shouted, but only a mewling left his lips. 'Shh, rest now. You have been asleep for three days; your body is broken, and it's a miracle that it survived that long. But your feats of courage where witnessed by all, and this morning the Voice of Malik called for you. Today you join the Immortals,' She said, that lovely smile in her face. They won. He would join his famous grand-grand-grand-grand-grandfather among the sacred warriors of Malik. And, most important of all - she survived. And the kiss they shared afterwards would be the last he would experience while still breathing. 

Simple drugs, such as Ibuprofen. Cheap presbyopia glasses. They are sold on the street for a couple of Euros in several Balkan countries and though not fitting the person exactly, would still be invaluable to them. It would be very hard to remake them, even if you get a pair. No need to fear causing a technical revolution (which rules out clocks, the dissembling of which would probably cause a lot of innovation). They were invented some time before 1286, but still very expensive. EDIT: There is this painting by Conrad von Soest, from AD 1403 showing the use of spectacles. So the best method would probably be to just give them the lenses - which were the veeery expensive part - and let them fashion a contemporary frame. Alternatively, you could gift them monocles with metal frames. 

I think “most powerful” is too vague a term. If divine magic is the most powerful in everything, I see no other way than reducing the users, as @Rekesoft already suggested. But looking at the real world we observe members of various cults don’t take kindly to your following any cult but theirs. I therefore propose a number of rivalising gods, each forbidding or discouraging the worship of others and granting powers in specific fields only. Any of these cults will have to ally to secular powers and secular magicians for access to a broader spectrum of magic. Assuming secular magic has a broader field of application. This kind of factionalism can help you build a complex and interesting web of interaction, perhaps with a twist due to an unexpected alliance? 

Is certainly, if they possess the means to establish communication with enough bandwidth - and colors can encode a lot of information. Modern computers use at least 3 bytes, or 24 bits, to express a pixel using the RGB format. A 1024x768 screen needs 18.87 Mb of data to express all its pixels. That means around 940 megabits per second on a 20ms refresh cycle. 

(Given the interesting points of view of some answers I dropped the tag, but would still like to keep it reasonably not so mushy.) 

If you asked me if a genetically modified terrestrial race can have cat-, dog- and bunny-like features, I'd say yes, probably. Convergent evolution is a thing, even among completely different species, so add a bit of near-future bioengineering and voilá. But an alien race... I don't know, that may be a bit too much. The Alien race need to be carbon-based, possess body mirrorring, fur-like external structures... the list of necessary coincidences is simply too high. But then, space is big. Like, really big. 

As far as mathematical options go, the best ones I know have already by suggested. I will suggest a different option, used by the Spartans. The Scytale. Basically you wind your medium around a rod and write along the rod. When the medium is unwound you get nothing but shuffled letters. The description in Wikipedia makes this most basic implementation appear easily breakable. While I am no expert, I suppose a few twists could be added: Don't align letters with stripes. If you always place your letters on the stripe perfectly, you have nothing but reshuffled letters. This is easily breakable, by statistical analysis of the letter frequency. Instead use very, very thin stripes, so that mere dots are found on each, offering no clue to which letter they belong. This might be difficult to reproduce by hand, but Heinrich will let a machine do the winding for him. Very neatly and reproducibly. Don't use a simple rod In the event that the stripes are found, the cryptanalyst will have the patience to test all kinds of rod diameters. Therefore, don't use a rod of fixed diameter, but rather a complicated shape, similar to what you get by spinning an elaborate key around the long axis, or the ones found here. Disguise the data as everyday objects Unfortunately, I do not know the shape and size of 19th century sewing spools, so I will take today's situation as a guide. If I had enough trusted technicians, I would use sewing yarn, or something resembling it as a medium. I would manufacture a machine typing on the yarn, while it is of course wound around the intricately shaped rod. It would type in tiny letters, wind and unwind the yarn for me and reading would be easy with a magnifying glass. When storing the data, I would wind it on an ordinary spool. I would take care to leave some yarn blank, so the outside of the yarn (when on an ordinary spool) would be blank and inauspicious. If my typing/printing technique is good enough, I can even hide my yarn inside Gobelins, carpets, clothes, for longer travel. Problems Yarn has an axis of rotation. To avoid that becoming a problem, you must have the ink seep through the yarn. That might be difficult to achieve uniformly. And you must leave blank layers, to avoid damaging layers below. 

Have someone from the International Space Station use a Soyuz-TMA to come down with a still-working laptop with all compilers they have available. (Hey, they aren't technically in the world...) 

Let's assume an original, folded density of 12g/cm³ to unfolded 3-4 mg/cm³ after coating removal - that means it gains roughly 3,500 times its original size. Due to friability the structure isn't stable, so it'll shatter like glass instantly once free of the coating - but not before leaving a 5-20cm radius hole where there was only a tiny needle just a few seconds ago. If it happens inside the heart... oh well! 

Of course! Both Arctic and Antarctic midnight suns stay in the sky for 6 months, alternating: $URL$ Quote from Wikipedia: 

You'll need processing power: Your animal may be able to fuel a brain by burning a lot of energy in bursts (in which case oxygen and sulphur may be your friends), live very long lives, distribute the processing across peers or a combination of these. And if you're wondering about permanent external memory storage... how about a virus? Maybe a evolutionary hiccup in a virus allowed the cephalopod's memories to be transcribe to the virus' genetic payload. Every 'infected' member shares the whole species' ascending memories, and new 'infections' updates the individual payloads. The virus itself transcribes the memories back in unused spaces. That would help with information density.
