Before the nuclear fusion in the core starts, the heat of the star comes from the contraction of the original nebula. When the matter comes closer together, the potential energy of it decreases, just like when you drop a rock. Energy is however constant, so it has to go somewhere. That "somewhere" is the heat in the newborn star. 

The Earth is a very smooth sphere, and the Sun even more so, with only minor fluctuations. I am wondering: are larger stars even rounder? Intuitively, that seems self evident, but I am not so sure. For instance, the hydrostatic equilibrium causes larger stars to be much less dense than red dwarfs. So what is the most important factor for how round a star is, a higher mass, or less activity? The most prominent cause of irregularities is of course the rotation rate of the star, which is pretty much independent of size. Ignoring that, do larger stars have smaller a deviations from the ellipsoid relative to their size? Edit As it seems like the "other than rotation rate" criterion is not really meaningfull, I now terminate it. 

The IRAF package is old. I've been looking around for a more modern software to replace it in the processes of CCD data reduction and photometry, but haven't been able to find any. The closest I've found is the PyRAF tool, but this seems more like a Python wrapper around IRAF rather than a replacement for it. Is there some new software I might've miss or is IRAF really the only option even today? 

You might want to have a look to the GALExtin models. The official site is still not finished (not even sure if it's still being developed), but you can access the original article here, and download the models here. Here's a poster that provides a quick introduction. Basically this is composed of two models of the Galaxy (one with spiral arms and one without) to which you give a direction and a distance, and it gives you back the extinction. It's a little bit old but perhaps it can be useful to you. Also, the advice given by Rob is a good one: for such small distances perhaps the best thing to do is to assume zero extinction. 

Why it is said that in standard Big Bang model space curvature grows with time when the Universe expands? My intuition is that it should be the opposite. I saw this in a book talking about the problem of standard Big Bang model and why we need inflation theory. It says that the Universe is observed to the nearly flat now. And because the space curvature grows with time, it should be even flatter in the past, which cannot be explained. But the inflation theory solves the problem because even if space is initially far from flat, inflation will smear out the curvature and make it flat. 

Just to clarify a concept here: there are no pictures of the Milky Way other than the ones taken from within the Solar system, and they all look somewhat like this: 

Everything else you see are artists' depictions of the Milky Way based on the latest research. This is the currently most accepted shape: 

i.e.: a spiral galaxy with four main arms. There is an ongoing discussion about whether our Galaxy is made up of four arms or just two. See for example: Vall√©e (2014), which sadly is not available online :( 

I'm looking for a free, open-source and Linux compatible alternative to the RegiStar software. I need it to automatically combine several images into a single frame, where each individual image shows a portion of a large observed region. Individual images also overlap by some amount, and need to be aligned and possibly rotated before superimposing them onto the final frame. I believe RegiStar does all this but: a- it is not free, b- it is not open-source, and c- it seems to run on Windows only. 

Why Helium-burning stars are found in a horizontal branch on the H-R diagram? Why do they have roughly the same luminosity? 

I am reading "The Essential Cosmic Perspective" by Jeffrey O. Bennett, Megan O. Donahue, Nicholas Schneider, Mark Voit. In Chapter 14, it is stated that an evidence of the presence of dark matter in our galaxy is that the rotational curve does not match that obtained from calculation. In the calculation, the following formula is used $$M_r=\frac{rv^2}{G}$$ where $M_r$ is the mass enclosed inside a radius $r$ from the galactic center. My understanding is that the above equation is a result of the shell theorem. But we know that shell theorem applies to spherically symmetric mass distribution only, and most galaxies are disks. So why can we still do this? 

Assuming your question is a reference request: I now about one resource that has a very broad range of spectral data, the NIST Atomic Spectra Database Lines Form This has worked great for me. This page lists a couple of different alternatives. For the near IR case you are interested in, several collections are listed here. 

The data is indeed very uncertain. As for GW150914, LIGO posted this image of the probable area of the sky: 

Use a constellation map! That will provide much of the information you need. Here are however some things you can try to spot: 

What about one meter from the poles? Or a kilometre? As long as you can see the celestial pole in the sky, you can see the stars revolve around it at night. Let us see if you are able to see the celestial pole. Texas was about 30 degrees north last time I checked: 

We know that an object falling to the black hole, as observed from an observer far away, will freeze as it gets closer and closer to the event horizon. So my question is how can a black hole form in the first place? I mean we usually say thing a star collapses into a blackhole. But considering the effect of "time-freezing", how could that be possible in the first place? 

When there are accretion discs jets of particles or radiations will be emitted in the direction parallel to the rotational axis. My beginner level astronomy textbook just says that it is due to magnetic field but does not explain why. So can anyone explain the mechanism in layman's terms? Thanks in advance! 

The "Vernal Equinox" is simply the direction of the line where they cross. You can not obtain the Earth latitude from the ecliptic latitude alone, as the planes are not parallel. You must know the ecliptic longitude as well. From equatorial to Earth latitude it is much simpler, the latitude is equal to the declination. 

That explains the circular movement of the stars, the Sun and the Moon. This is true for all locations on the Earth, except for the equator: 

As two objects revolve around each other, they would make two waves per orbit,resulting in a double frequency of the system's rotation. 

I will expect that gravitational lensing should turn an object into a ring image. But I saw in some situations that instead multiple images are formed. For example, the Einstein-cross in the image below, consisting of four images: 

Yes, you can't land in the usual sense. You just sink into the gas and will be destroyed by the high pressure at some point. In fact deep inside the gas may be even denser than the ship and so the ship will tend to float. Anyway if you really want to "land", then assuming that somehow your ship survives all the adverse conditions and you have an engine to oppose the upthrust and to pass through the metallic hydrogen mantle, you will finally "land" at the solid core of the planet. 

Say I have a FITS file with an observed field of stars, each one with x,y coordinates given in pixels. Assume the image is aligned so that the x axis is the right ascension, and the y axis the declination. I'm looking for a tutorial to transform the pixel coordinates of each star to equatorial, even if the transformation is approximate. I'v been looking for a while but found no tutorial/book/site that enumerates the steps needed to produce this transformation. 

Add: I forgot to mention this, but I'm looking for tools that work under Linux and are free (open source + no charge), if possible. I will not pay (neither for a Windows license nor for a software package) to get rid of IRAF.
