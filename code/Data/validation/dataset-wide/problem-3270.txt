You are correct. According to this site (unfortunately in German) about the Roman Empire there were many different types of dice in use by the Romans. Apart from the 6-sided cubes we know today there were also rod-shaped dice with four or six sides. The website reports: 

Criminals were sent to concetration camps (like the non-criminals by most of a modern democracy's standards) in which the treatment was not in accordance with common standards, such as non-torture. Criminals wore a green triangle -green used to be the color of the police in Germany- for identification on their inmate's uniform. The Nazis implemented a law for murder, in which they coined a new definition of what is considered to be murder. A murder is a crime that is comitted treacherously or sneakishly, or "with low morals". This is an offender-based description of a crime. This definition is still contained in today's murder law in Germany. Judges are forced to respect it, thereby neglecting "looking at the circumstances of each individual crime" [BBC article about the German murder law]. 

There have been chats related to a post-work society at least since the industrial revolution. Paul Lafarge, for instance, wrote an essay called the Right to be Lazy (1880, published 1883): 

But like the Romans, the Greeks valued wine and olives. A place where you can't grow either isn't a prime location to build a new settlement. With respect to your specific examples, they technically did settle the Western Atlantic, in that it likely is Greeks who introduced wine in the Bordeaux region. 

I'd put forward there was an inflection point that occurred at some point during the 19th century. It's probably not a single event, and one could probably go on at length as to the precise reasons. You can see clearcut evidence of this on the eve of the Boxer War. In response to the atrocities in China, the German Emperor infamously urged his troops to 'behave like Huns', triggering outrage across Europe (p.873). As little as a century or two earlier, it would have been so matter of factly - indeed expected - that troops would do so that it wouldn't have registered as something worth instructing. 

"Dark History" doesn't give a source for this supposed order from Hitler. I don't think the site is credible by itself, since it's just a blog. From what I've read and heard about the topic (I can't give references either, since I didn't write the books and tv shows down), the Nazis just used the means of execution that had already been in place at these prisons before during the Weimar Republic. I'm not aware that the courts gave verdicts specifying the means of execution. 

The two officers behind the man in red look like they are wearing French Gendarmerie uniforms. Also, are those mountains in the back? I'm not sure the guy is English, despite his red jacket. The soldier in the far back wears a heat with a red hackle. The French Garde Republicaine wears similar hats with red hackles. $URL$ 

The two generals Scharnhorst and Gneisenau reformed the Prussian army at the beginning of the 19th century. The two are considered the fathers of this reform. 

The Germans changed the gauge from Russian to German and could then use their own equipment. $URL$ shows Wehrmacht railroad engineers (the military sort of engineer) changing the gauge. Reichsbahn personnel, civilians and forced laborers were also used to change the gauge. 

Some counts are off because I didn't bother dropping a day when a session ended on the same day as the next one began - but it's no big deal to see trends. The sheet also breaks down whether Congress was in session during spring, summer, autumn, or winter. (But unfortunately not how many days.) Anyway, a few patterns emerge: 

Yet, insofar as I understood, the difference between the two was not that significant in practice. Diseases afflicted both. Famines disproportionally afflicted the poor, but methinks comparing the life expectancy of the wealthy elite who can afford food during a harvest failure with that of the poor who cannot is a bit like comparing apples to oranges. Similarly, comparing life expectancy of anyone with that of those who lived through the Black Death isn't fair. If you adjust for famines and diseases (and child birth, in the case of women), life expectancy between the two groups then probably wasn't so different, or for that matter not so different from what it is today. I'd add in passing that, even today, a new pandemic like the Spanish flu could potentially wipe out swaths of people, making little if any distinction between the poor and the rich. The major changes between the Middle Ages and now revolve around improved sanitation (eliminating filth-related diseases), hygiene (ensuring women and babies survive birth), vaccines for diseases that were prevalent in the past (ensuring most children make it to adulthood), and of course antibiotics (ensuring sick children and adults survive diseases or surgical acts that could have been fatal a century ago). 

Over the centuries, the equipment has looked like this (there is also World War I British equipment displayed): 

Frederick II. was in opposition to the popes. Stories presenting him in bad light are nowadays attributed to the popes' propaganda. 

[Source (sic) given in Wikipedia is Franz Herre: Napoleon Bonaparte. Eine Biographie. München 2006, S. 12–18, Volker Ullrich: Napoleon. Reinbek bei Hamburg 2004, S. 16–22.] From the English Wikipedia on James MacPherson, a Scottish writer and politician: 

Terminal train stations were built in continental Europe because many railroads connected only two cities in the early to mid 19th century. There were not many rail lines, and the stations built were terminal stations. As the railroad network increased, the terminal stations could not be converted to passthrough anymore. 

Germany was perceived as the aggressor and cause of World War I by the Allied powers. It gave a "carte blanche" to its ally Austria, which was about to declare war on Serbia just because the Austrian successor to the throne was killed by a Bosnian Serb. The Germans attacked France executing their "Schlieffen-Plan" which required they march through Belgium which was Allies with Great Britain. The German situation in late 1918 was rather hopeless on the front - Germany had no ways to counter the tanks, which made trench warfare obsolete, and the United States had brought fresh troops to the war. 

This was a major raid by Khemer Rouge forces over the Vietnamese border, resulting in the deaths of over 3000 Vietnamese. For more information and details, please see: $URL$ $URL$ Was Pol Pot that foolish enough to think that he could carry out such a raid without a severe response from Vietnam? It turned out that this raid was a major catalyst leading to Vietnam’s invasion of Cambodia and subsequent overthrow of the Khemer Rouge. The only logical explanation for this raid that I can think of is that Pol Pot was using Vietnamese border raids as a way of distracting the militant energy of his subordinates instead of letting this militancy result in a potential coup against himself. If this was the case, this got out of hand quickly. Or this was a decision made by a local Khemer Rouge commander that Pol Pot was not aware of. In any case, this raid would later set a lot in motion two invasions (Vietnam vs Cambodia and China vs Vietnam) and years of insurgency in Cambodia. 

Slightly massaged version of the data located by Sempaiscuba in this Google Sheet. There were a few errors in the data. I used it to produce this chart of US Congress days in session per year: 

As to why none of these went down in history as world war one, I believe Tom's and Korvin's answers sum it up: 

Your question seems to answer itself. As in yes, per your first source they have interbred to the tune of the UK having 1M or so people with Roman ancestors. Romans intermixed of course - they did so everywhere they settled, just like people do nowadays when they change countries. Populations mix, then like now. Per your second source, only 1M Britons out of 65M or so have Roman ancestors. That's quite low: it's a few percent of the population. But how low is that really? Even if you ignore a generous percentage of the total population owing to them not being nationals, descending from recent waves of UK immigrants, descending from earlier settlers or invaders like Saxons, Scots, Picts, Vikings, French, and I'm sure I'm missing many others, not to mention internal migrations from places that didn't intermix with Romans like Scotland, Ireland, and islands up north, and other reasons one might come up with, it'll still be a fraction of the population. But then flip the problem around and it actually looks quite high, actually. Romans didn't migrate wholesale to Anglia. Consider how awful the place is for a Roman. It's cold and wet by any reasonable Mediterranean standard, and it barely - if at all - grows olive trees or wine grapes. Romans that went there were administrative and military staff first and foremost, and the population of London estimates when Romans were around would suggest they weren't that many to boot. Yet they interbred to the tune of having a whopping 1M descendants. Not bad. 

I was looking up the war between Tanzania and Uganda, where Tanzanian forces invaded Uganda to remove Idi Amin, and learned that Idi Amin was able to hold out for a little while thanks to the support of a contingent of Libyan forces sent by Khadafi. Here is an interesting article that summarizes the campaign: $URL$ The question is, why did Khadafi chose to back Idi Amin, even to the extent of deploying military assets in support of the Ugandan Army? Did Khadafi think he could establish a base in the region that he could use to promote Libyan power and influence? Did Khadafi see economic interests in the African Great Lakes region, and hoped to use Uganda as a country from which to back his regional economic interests with military force? What happened to the Libyans once Idi Amin fell? Did they just flee to neighboring countries? Or did the bulk of the Libyan forces surrender, and had to be repatriated back to Libya under tough negotiations? Brian Ghilliotti 

Why didn’t the Chinese leave a trip wire force in North Korea after the Korean War in a similar fashion to the United States leaving a trip wire force in South Korea? 

Life expectancy upon reaching adulthood was shorter in the past than it is today (e.g. you'd live up to age 64 or so on average in late Medieval England if you made it to adulthood). Yes, a nobleman or a monarch, who enjoyed slightly better hygiene than the commoner, and more/better food, would have lived somewhat longer. Primarily, I'd put forward, because the upper classes had food to begin with during famines. 

The two goals are actually related, in the sense that alchemists expected to achieve them by discovering and using the legendary philosopher's stone. It had a laundry list of properties: 

(The article on microscopes has a similar claim with a few other potentially useful references.) Cursory googling for medieval lens examples yields this page, among others. It has a pictures of a crystal lens that pre-dates eyeglasses. In fact, the latter article yields reading stones, which might very well be what you're looking for: 

(Too long for a comment, so posting this as an answer.) The rules on how to wear seal rings vary quite a bit nowadays, and likely reflect the fact that they weren't universal in the past either. FWIW traditional French conventions (in French) are as follows: 

I was looking through Wikipedia (a mixed quality source) about the military history of Yugoslavia, when I noticed this odd listing of Yugoslavia as one of the combatants in the Angolan Civil War (1975-2002). If this was true, then it deviates from Yugoslavia's traditional foreign policy of neutrality and non-intervention during the Cold War. The Wikipedia article that mentions this does not go into any detail about this topic other than the list. Here is the link: $URL$ I would imagine that Yugoslavia, whatever it was doing there, must have left the conflict zone well before the break up process of that country in the mid 1990's. Besides this conclusion, I must wonder what the mission of the Yugoslavian military was in Angola? Was it to just provide non-combat military assistance? Did it provide stand off combat military related support, such as artillery cover, air support, and military training? Or did Yugoslav military forces get involved in frontline, tactical level engagements with hostile military forces in that country? If anyone could please fill me in on this historical oddity, it would be appreciated. Thanks. Brian Ghilliotti 

The footnote suggests it's a quote from a book named "The Great World of the London Streets" by Henry Mayhew, 1862. Googling yields a very similarly titled book, "The Great World of London" by the same author from around the same time (1856) that apparently ended up published under a slightly different title in 1862. The online book contains the above quote. (The quote doesn't say it was a street where "respectable" bookshops were concentrated.) Editing to add, courtesy of Steve Bird, that the wikipedia article on Paternoster Row also offers that:

It wasn't simple to track time at night until the invention of mechanical clocks. Before that the breakpoint between days was sunrise (early Roman), solar midnight (later Roman), or sunset (Athenians, Jews) depending on the area and period. Also worth noting is that until mechanical clocks the length of hours would also vary from a day to the next, and time at night wasn't always counted the same way as during the day. The Roman time table that follows, for instance, highlights how days were split in 12 like today, while nights were split in 4 segments in practice - the latter corresponding to guard shifts.
