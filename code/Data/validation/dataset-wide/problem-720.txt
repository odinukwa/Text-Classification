A crack in the rim is something which needs to be dealt with fairly immediately. It isn't likely to fail catastrophically, but is it worth the risk of the damage to your body, or more importantly, to the rest of your components? I'd get to the shop within a few days and avoid riding it very much, at least, until you do. There is really no downside to getting it done sooner, and potentially significant downsides to waiting if you keep riding it. 

You should have little trouble with your ride pattern above after that, assuming you maintain your nutrition. This assumes you have a decent base fitness, based on the fact that you tried that ride above and made it as far as you did. But if you are unable to easily follow the first week pattern, then start instead with a 35km twice a week ride, plus 50km once a week for a 2 week cycle, and continue alternating that with the 1st week cycle above until you are confident you can move ahead with the plan listed above in its entirety. I hope that helps. 

Within "normal" standards of long and high angle, yes it is safe. While there are some stems which use clamping styles which are not carbon safe, or other restrictions, these are usually clearly stated. No restrictions are based on length or angle of the stem, that I am aware of. I have been a certified professional bicycle mechanic for 20 years, so I would think I'd have seen it by now, if it were an issue. :) 

You rim should be centered over your hub. If you are using the tool correctly, and the rim is not centered, it should be redished. If you are not confident in your abilities and knowledge on the subject, get a second opinion from your LBS mechanic before you make changes to the wheel. Sometimes, those kind of changes are difficult to reverse. 

There are good Campagnolo parts on it which may be collectible, and it is a Masi frame, which held quite a bit of value for some time. It's not in bad shape, but not so good as to justify mint condition collector value. I doubt it has any serious value even fully restored unless it was actually ridden by Fausto Coppi or Eddy Merckx (which is understandably unlikely), but if you take the time for a restoration, you may get a couple thousand or so dollars from a collector with a particular interest in Masi. Anything beyond that would require a specialist in the subject, and provenance on the frame. 

There are 2 possible causes for this type of failure. The first is a need to be cleaned and lubricated, as you have noted. That is usually a gradual failure, an would usually not result in sticking both shift levers together like you describe. On the STI lever, at the top where it joins the lever body, there is a small screw. If this screw has loosened enough to have the head stick out, it will also cuase the symptoms you are describing, and it is more likely to be an immediate change from working, to not working. Good news is if this is the problem, its likely an easy fix. Just tighten the screw. I'll try to post a photo later. 

Use a cutting fluid such as CF-2. When cutting the surface of the disc mount, it is important to achieve a flat surface for the brake mount. In the image below, both mounts are adequately faced. Notice the left and right mount do not look identical. However, if the two mounts were faced to the same reference on the cutter, the job is done. 

The best option is to have a bike that doesn't wobble at speed. On a road bike, there are many bikes which are stable at upwards of 60 mph, and on an MTB, it should be similarly stable, although it is unlikely you will ever ride it at that speed. Speed wobble is caused by an excessive amount of movement between the rider interface, which is in this case the handlebar, and the wheel. That movement can be in the bar/stem, headset, fork, or wheel. It is a sign of a poorly spec'd bike at best, and possibly of a poorly designed frame. Training for methods of falling safely is not a bad idea, as at some point you're pretty much guaranteed to fall, but avoiding falls by riding safe equipment is better. Avoiding impact with your head or spine are the priorities in a crash. For that reason, sliding the bike out is our best option, however painful it might be. Looping out a wheelie is not a good option unless you're confident of staying on your feet, and you can't be confident enough to risk that. Going over the bars is a movie stunt that isn't likely to end before ou plant your face in the ground. Repeat, head contact bad. There is no safe way to crash. Ride safe equipment, and avoid crashing where possible, and be ready to suffer if you can't avoid the crash. 

V-brake pads are rubber. Degreaser can (but not always does) damage rubber. use isopropyl alcohol. It will remove the grease without damaging the rubber pads. It may take multiple applications. Clean the rims with it as well. Quoting from Daniel's answer, with edits: 

Chain ring clearance to the frame, because a larger tooth count has a larger diameter. Since the chain stay is at an angle, and designed for a certain diameter, too large a ring will come too close to the frame. Anything closer than 5 mm, is not a good idea, since a larger chain ring will also flex more. Maximum tooth count for front derailleur. A front derailleur is designed to work and shift well with a certain size of ring. There is usually a small range above that which can be used. (i.e. Shimano's 3x XT FD-M785 is designed for a 44t, but can accept up to 48t.) Cable pull ratio for front shifter/Chainring spacing 

The only difference is the model number, and the year of the design. They are fully compatible, assuming the number of gears is the same, and that you buy the appropriate match to your bike. The road version is Tiagra 8 speed. The mountain/hybrid version is Alivio 8 speed. 

See the Schwalbe Rocket Ron. 29x2.25, good, fast rolling knobby with enough width to be stable in the rock garden, and comfy, good cornering feel, and good hook up. It even sheds mud well. i ride it in Pacific Northwest singletrack, including Whistler and Banff, which is fairly similar to Colorado, if not quite as dry. 

I use the Garmin, originally with my iPhone, and since with my Garmin Edge 800. There's really nothing to discuss, it's been solid for at least 4 years, requires no set up, and just works, at least in my experience. I use the Wahoo iPhone dongle, when I use it for my iPhone, and when I use the iPhone to set up my power meter crank set. Both work well. I didn't find using the iPhone to be all that practical to use as a bike computer, and the cost of the sensors and dongles and cases was just about the same as the dedicated Edge 800 by the time all was said and done. I hope that helps. 

It is best to remove your current bottom bracket to check, but as a rule of thumb, a triple (3 gear) front crank uses a 118mm. A double (2 gear) front crank uses a 109mm. 

There are many tire options available. The Schwalbe Marathon Plus in. 700x35c, or the Specialized Armadillo tires in the same size will work for you needs. The bike has other issues, though, including the mentioned missing brake. It also appears to be small for someone 6 foot tall. I would recommend having a good mechanic thoroughly check it over before riding it. 

If your rear derailleur is in the 28t cog, there is only one click available, because shifting to the next (non-existent) cog would put your chain in your wheel. Because of the way the Double Tap levers work, the first click will release to the next gear down, either 27t or 26t depending on your cassette. There is nothing to fix. This is proper behavior for this group set. 

If you are using the device for turn by turn directions, then the Garmin 800 is really the only available choice which meets all of my requirements for a cycling computer with GPS. If you don't need turn by turn, consider the 500. It's got all the othe features, except the tur by turn. I've tried the iPhone, but the lack of integrated sensors and good, solid handlebar mounts. Also, the iPhone is only cost effective if you already own it. Otherwise, it is far more expensive, after accounting for buying transmitters and receivers. The Oregon, eTrex, or others are suited well for the handheld hiking options, and will work with a bike, but you still have to buy the sensors, and they aren't exactly cheap. So my answer is, no. There aren't any other GPS cycling computers which do the same job, as well, for less cost. 

In an ideal world, use both. A wide beam light on the handlebar keeps the light on the road in front of you, even when your viewpoint changes, which can save you if an obstacle comes up in front of you in a hurry. However, if the trail curves sharply, and your light is fixed to the handlebar, then the light can be pointed in the wrong direction, which can have the opposite effect. Adding a helmet mounted light ensures that you have light where you are looking, i.e. down the trail. This can be expensive, but it is the best choice. Barring that option, use a bar mounted light with a bright, wide beam. It is more important to keep light on the ground in front of the bike, that off the trail where your viewpoint might be focused, and a helmet mounted light can be more annoying to other riders. Just my 2 cents. 

Sorry, I wasn't going to post this as an answer, but I couldn't post the photo otherwise. Credit goes to @Moz There are adjustment washers. I can see them in the picture. 

Aluminum in general has a useful fatigue life of about 5 years. Which is why most manufacturers have started limiting frame warranties to 5 years. Fatigue Life data for 6061 alloy here. If your folder has been ridden regularly over the 7 years you've owned it, then consider replacing them. If it's been lightly used, or mostly garaged, then you're are probably ok. There is no way to check the soundness of the metal short of an ultrasound or possibly X-ray testing. So if you are concerned, which I gather from the fact that you asked the question that you are, then just change them. it will be worth the piece of mind. 

Bottechia frames from that period use an italian threaded bottom bracket. I assume also down tube friction shifters? The simple answer is that you can upgrade the bike all the way to current standards, if you are willing to spend the money. But it is not what most would consider to be cost effective to do so. Upgrading the rear freewheel beyond a 7 speed cluster isn't likely to work, without new wheels, and if you only upgrade to a 7-speed freewheel, you will need to change your chain to match. Changing your chain requires changing your derailleurs, both of them, preferably, although you might get away with leaving the front derailleur. If you spend the money to go that far, a whole new bike kit, which should be possible to make work on the frame, isn't that different in price, depending on your choices. A SRAM Apex Kit should cost around $1500 dollars, including new basic wheels, and current standard wide range gearing. But if you want to keep the original wheels, you will be very limited in how far you can change things. 

Bottom Bracket Taps and Facing tools are an expensive and highly specialized tool. As a workshop, owning them and knowing when and how to use them properly, is one of the key signs of a professional shop. Many new frames are moving to design without threads, but these tools will continue to be valuable for years to come. These are the brands I'm familiar with, and recommend:
