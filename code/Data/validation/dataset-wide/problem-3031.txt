It has been a long time, and I have already accepted an answer, and I am satisfied with it. But I'm reading The Guns of August right now, and I discovered following small facts. It's not a very important things, because the nations were already set on a collision course, but I think they are worth noting anyway. Germany had developing Schlieffen Plan against France for several years, in which France was to be attacked via Belgium (and Luxembourg). Germany had made repeated attempts, direct or otherwise, to gauge the British response if Germany violated Belgian neutrality. Britain was however committed to the neutrality and made it clear (to both Germany as well as France, but in different tone) that whoever violates Belgian neutrality would not have British support. Secondly, when it was clear that the war on the Eastern Front was inevitable in the last couple of days of July 1914, because of Austria-Serbia-Russia crisis, German high command (especially the Kaiser) seriously contemplated abandoning the Schlieffen Plan, and attacking Russia instead. They even asked France whether it would remain neutral in a Russo-German war, but it replied that "France would take an action in its own interests". This formal interaction, in my opinion, gives some kind of legitimacy to the war against France. In either case, von Moltke, who himself was very much committed to the plan, managed to convince Kaiser that the military commitments to the plan were irreversible, and thus Germany entered into a war on two fronts.

Alexander the Great was, again, one of those accidents that changes the course of history. It just so happens that he was Greek (technically, a Macedonian). And he did have an enormous impact in the whole Mediterranean, Mesopotamian, and Persian regions, in process, Hellenizing them. 

Congress of Vienna took place in 1814-1815 aiming to restore stability in Europe after the Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars. Each state/kingdom sent their diplomat(s) to the congress in order to negotiate and gain most for the state. It is true that Metternich was the mastermind, and Austria (re)gained control of parts of Italy, but they lost them within half a century during Italian unification. So which of the great European powers enjoyed the most benefits from the Congress in the long run? Or was it none of them, achieving the "Balance of Power" as it had hoped to? I can't exactly quantify "benefits", but it should include economic, or territory-wise benefits, or getting access to some key strategic locations or strategic benefits. 

I decided to read the book anyway, after waiting for someone to answer the question. I understand this is not a place to review books, but here are my two cents. The narrative is, in my opinion, as unbiased as it can get. While talking about unclear parts of Indian history like Aryan invasion / migration / indigenous Aryans, he explains pros and cons of each theory before explaining the generally accepted theory. Also, the narration of post-independence politics (intra-national or international) politics seems objective. As I hoped it to be, it doesn't discredit India from its achievements, nor does it over-glorify them. A must-read for anyone who is interested in Indian history. 

It is important that even though Napoleon was beginning to have land superiority in Europe after the Revolutionary wars, the extent of Royal Navy's reach was far superior than that of French Navy. Specifically, Royal Navy had a Mediterranean Fleet, with a base in Gibraltar. That should more or less answer the first question. As for the second question, it seems like (see this) the role of British forces in the Siege of Acre was providing cannon firepower from the Royal Navy ships HMS Tigre and Theseus, whereas the land army was Ottoman. British also trained some Turkish forces, but the infantry was mainly Turkish, and not British. For the last question about British possession of Cyprus, it is not true. British took control of Cyrpus after Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78. It was under Ottoman control before. 

Although the question is too broad in scope to be answered on this site, I shall attempt to address some of the points raised in the question. To summarize, as is often the case, the importance of Greeks is most attributable to the reason that often dominates most of the history -- coincidence. 

The Thirty Years' War broke out with the Bohemian Revolt in May 1618. Spain was being ruled by Habsburgs, and it was involved in the politics of HRE. Once the news of the revolt reached Spain, they sent an army to Bohemia and defeated the Bohemian forces in the Battle of the White Mountain on 8th November 1620. I came to know from a reliable source that the news of the Bohemian took a few months to reach Spain. This seems long, even by early modern standards. How much time would it generally take for such an important news to reach from Bohemia to Spain in early 17th century? Was there any particular reason why it took so long, especially given that Spain was involved in politics of HRE? I can't find any freely available source on the internet to back this up (and the original source is a purchasable lecture series), but I don't think there is any reason why the instructor would lie about this. 

Rome had expansionist policy from its early days since the Dacian conquest by Trajan. During these several centuries, Rome took on powerful and established powers such as Carthage, Macedon, Selucid kingdom and so on. It didn't have much difficulty in conquering loose barbarian tribes either, such as the conquests of Gaul and Britain. However, Rome never managed to conquer the Germanic tribes, and the Rhine Danube frontier was always a potential trouble spot for Romans. Why is that? Now, Romans certainly tried advances in Germany¹, but they were unsuccessful. Most notable example of this would be the disastrous Battle of the Teotoburg Forest. But I am interested in the reasons at a higher level. Also, it is curious that they never forayed significantly in this region. Mesopotamia was a key area for Romans, and they had at least managed to conquer it once; even though they couldn't even hold it for a decade (Trajan's Mesopotamia). There is no analog for Germany. Was it because Romans were never interested in Germany? If the scope of this is too broad, then I am interested in the expansionist phase of Roman history, possibly from start of second century B.C. to the end of Trajan's reign. ¹ By Germany I mean what Romans meant by Germania. 

It is important to highlight (a rather obvious) fact that even though we use Greek alphabet in the sciences, most of the European languages do not use it in their scripts -- those are Latin alphabet or some variations thereof. So the most ubiquitous alphabet is Latin, and not Greek. And since the (Western) European scientists were using Latin alphabet (and until recently, even the Latin language) to "write" the sciences, they turned to the second closest alphabet that they were familiar with -- Greek -- for symbols. So to summarize, Greeks have a perceived success only because they have an unparalleled cultural position in the Western Civilization, and Western Civilization happens to be the most dominant one at the present, in terms of cultural as well as science-technological advances. Furthermore, this is not a direct influence, but rather an indirect one coming via Romans who were Hellenized when they came in contact with the Greeks in the 2nd Century B.C. However, this is not to be mistaken with Greeks being a continuous historical anomaly for the 3-4 centuries that the Greek civilization lasted. Contemporary civilizations like China and India were comparable to the Greeks, but it just so happens that those civilizations have not influenced the Western Civilizations as much as the Greeks. 

India had won some territory in the 1971 Indo-Pakistani war, which was a victory for India and newly independent Bangladesh. However, India ceded the territory in the 1972 Simla agreement as a gesture of goodwill. 

In the aspect of sciences and philosophy, Greek civilization was not particularly "ahead by miles" compared to its contemporary civilizations. At least on top of my mind, Indian philosophers, mathematicians and medicinal experts were on par with their Greek counterparts. But as it happens, the Western Civilization inherits its culture from Greece. As for the wars, if you trace the trajectory to understand the current situation in Europe (or, let's say, why WW2 happened) -- the oldest well-documented history is that from Greece. That is not to say that other civilizations did not have a significant history or they did not document it. It's just that Greek history is most relevant for understanding European history. 

I know that Belarus and Ukraine were granted seats in the UN even though they were part of USSR because Stalin wanted more seats (and votes) in the UN. I am not entirely sure, but maybe there was a similar case for India and Britain as well. Or perhaps, it was foreshadowing of the coming era of decolonization. 

Apotheosis of Roman Emperors and their close relatives after their death was a common practice in the Roman Empire. I understand that it wasn't a meaningless ritual, there was an elaborate Imperial Cult around that concept. We also know that monotheistic religions inside the empire -- like Judaism and Christianity -- were reluctant, or even hostile to the pagan rituals, or even symbolism. One example of this is that of Pontius Pilate, who tried to bring military standards with pagan imagery on them. This lead to a fiasco, and finally he had to remove that imagery from the standards. My question is: Had it been the imagery of the Imperial Cult, instead of actual pagan imagery, would it have resulted in a similar reaction from the Jews? In other words, when the ex-emperors and their relatives were elevated Godhood, would the Jews and Christians also view them as rival Gods? (I know that since they are monotheistic, they won't accept anything else except the God as God. But I hope my question is clear -- I don't know how to frame it) 

The history of ancient civilizations in Mesopotamia has been a complex one, with several empires spanning a couple of millennia. Were the people from latter empires, say Neo-Assyrian or Achaemenid Empires aware of the existence of earlier empires, say Akkadian or Babylonian Empires? 

To add to the existing answers, I think it is important to emphasize that Greek was only the official languages in most of the Hellenistic kingdoms (that were outside the Greek lands), but especially in Ptolemaic Egypt. In Ptolemaic Egypt, the ruling class consisted of Greeks, but the vast majority of native population that could not speak Greek was treated with scorn. The Ptolemaic Kings did not try to integrate Greek language amongst the local population. The following letter (see the second letter of this) demonstrates this fact. 

Google search revealed that the one on the left is Sándor Garbai. (from $URL$ The one to his right seems kind of similar to an individual named Béla Kun, but I am not fully sure. [EDIT]: This Wiki page on Béla Kun has same image (from different angle I suppose), and its caption says "Sandor Garbai and Bela Kun, leaders of the Hungarian Soviet Republic, 1919". So I believe he is Béla Kun. 

Noting on side that "only" 300 brave Spartan soldiers killing 22,000 Persian soldiers is simply not true, it is indeed true that Spartan had a radically different and harsh way of life than any contemporary state. However, it is not clear how this unique way of life used to measure "success" of the Greeks. 

When Alexander was forced by his army to abandon the Indian campaign and to turn back, he took the sea route, whereas he ordered the army to cross the Gedrosian desert. Which ancient (and/or modern) port did he leave from? Cursory research doesn't reveal anything. 

I understand that Rome accused the Kingdom of Macedon to have supported Carthage in the first and/or second Punic war, and that was the reason of the Macedonian wars. Is this true, or was it just a pretext? If the accusation was true, what were the motivations behind such a support (by Macedon to Carthage) — was it the case of the enemy of my enemy is my friend? Also, what was the nature of the support? 

India received independence from the British Empire in 1947. It had a long history of independence movement, stretching from 19th century, but it had gained a massive support only from 1910-1920. The question is, to what extent is it due to the independence movement? Or is the weakened state of British Empire after WW2 the major reason behind granting independence? I'm not exactly asking Would India have gained independence had there not been WW2? I am asking - Was the independence movement a nontrivial factor behind the independence? And if it is, what made the British Empire pay heed to the peaceful protests (for the most part) of the Indian independence movement? Note: I have posted this question after a discussion in chat.
