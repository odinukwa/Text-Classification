That is a "punch/reamer". It allows your to repair leather (for example). You thread a thread of something though the hole and then use the sharp end to punch/push the thread though leather. In this way you can repair boots, etc. 

There's a lot of talk in the media at the moment about Kevin Jorgeson and Tommy Caldwell Free ascent of the dawn wall of El Capitan. This wall's been climbed before but this is the first time it's been free climbed. What are Kevin Jorgeson and Tommy Caldwell doing differently now that hasn't been done before? 

The Uk has a large walking culture and you will hopefully meet lots of happy and enthusiastic people on your journey, Enjoy! 

Pretty much everything wears out more quickly in a stuff sack. They put additional pressures onto the fibres, etc. So yes it will. How much quicker is open to debate and will vary considerably depending on how compressed, for how long and what fibres, treating you have on the item. 

Killamanjaro has relatively simple terrain. The main issue with climbing it is it's height (it's nearly 6000m/20,000feet). You will need to acclimatise correctly. It will take several days to do this so you will need to spend some time on the mountain (this won't be a day hike!) Most people who climb this mountain do so as part of an organised group. If you've only done day hikes I'd recommend joining one. In fact as Ben, says in comments (you need one!) You will need a permit. Many, many people climb Killamanjaro. It's not overly testing. To prepare you're probably best doing plenty of cardio training and/or climb some smaller peaks to get used to the exertion needed in climbing mountains. 

No again, the national parks have the highest level of protection in the UK. These have been used intensivly though, since before the national parks existed! Turns out I was wrong, see Gerrit answer below. 

I'd dispute this TBH. 5.10 rubber is softer (stealth rubber). This is to aid friction not to make them more comfortable. What makes shoes more comfortable is buying the right shoe, regardless of make. Every shoe will fit differently and everyone's feet are different sizes and shapes so it's hard to give advice in this area. Try on lot's and lots of different shoes and see which one's work for you. Look out for "hot spots" (where the foot feels hot in a particualr area). This is a sign that the shoe is a bad fit in this area. I wear my 5.10s tight. They're 2 sizes smaller than my street shoes but different people opt for different options in this regard. You want your toes (somewhat compressed) in general. This aids your ability to place weight though your toes. How compressed is a martter of preference, it's about balancing comfort with performance. = , = . 

I'm looking at buying my first pair of snowboard boots. I'm heading to Scotland and the Alps (Portes Du Soleil) this winter. I ride about "Red" level runs with my girlfriend (who'c onsideribly better than me) dragging me off piste (more ot the side of the piste) occasionally and always trying to make me do increasingly harder runs... What kind of boots/boot features should I be looking for in buying my first boots? I've always rented before now but I would like to not end the day with blisters this winter..! 

Your equipment should all come with a Kn rating. this is the force that that piece of gear will hold (often in what direction). So looking at a standard carabiner: 

Never, ever enter the water yourself. The most likely outcome of this is you both drown! Your first thought should always be, "how can I alert the authorities as fast as possible". If you leave the area to do this make a note of exactly where you are first. If you have alerted the authorities (life guard, police, ambulance, etc.) or can't for some reason then you can try the below. The Royal society for the prevention of accidents (Rospa) has the following advice: 

A quote after he'd spent 2 years on the sea ice in the antarctic, including a journey of 720 nautical miles in an open 10 man rowing boat across one of the worlds most dangerous oceans: 

Which is great, but I'm not sure I trust wikipedia! Does anyone have any experience of eating/preparing these? 

The decomposers provide an important role in recycling energy back into the system. If you remove this dead wood you remove some primary source of food for a low level of the pyramid and also some habitat for others. Note; the lower in the chain the removal happens the bigger the affect higher up as only 10% of the energy is transferred upwards. Without food there will be less primary consumers. Without habitat the higher levels increase competition for what resources remain and numbers decline. The nett result is less of everything and a less healthy ecosystem. The dead wood is like the glue that holds this ecosystem together. A neat wood is an unhealthy wood. Woods should be cluttered! Obviously the impact will depend on how much wood you plan to remove. In the UK it's actually common for wood managers to cut wood and leave it to rot specifically to increase the amount of dead wood as it will make the habitat more healthy. 

At first I got excited thinking it was an osprey but I'm now pretty sure that's incorrect, it doesn't appear to be bird of prey too me. I put the weird flight pattern down to it being mobded by crows but it seems to always do it. Almost like a display. the first time I saw the bird it was in a field next to the sea. So I thought it was a sea bird, but now I've also seen one inland by my house. So I think it's a farmland bird. I've only ever seen one or two, never a flock. I live in North Wales. I've tried googling it but I don't seem to get any results... 

I'm presuming your on an overhanging wall here as if you can touch the wall you should walk down preventing this issue. 

I've heard they are very out of date (date to the Franco period) I've heard they are very poor quality I have no idea where you can get these from. 

The angle (at the attachment point) of this triangle dictates the amount of load that is passed to each anchor. If the angle is 60 degrees of less each anchor point receives 58% or the load placed on the attachment point. This is generally regarded as a safe amount. As the angle increases beyond 60 degrees: 

Try not to bang around. If your making a lot of noise then you are likely not moving efficiently. Pick how and where you want to move your foot and do it slowly, controlled and efficiently. Try not to throw your foot in the general direction and hope that it sticks. Get correctly fitting shoes. Beginners often have shoes that are too big for them. Climbing shoes shouldn't have dead space. They should be tight on your foot. If they are not then your foot will be moving around inside the shoe. Old shoes. again I see this a lot. Rental shoes can be pretty crappy. Consider buying a cheap pair instead. A very worn shoe will not stick to the wall as well as a newer one. Trust it. This takes time. You have to learn that you can stand on a tiny hold and it will hold you. If your planning on using a foothold. Place it transfer your weight, believe that it won't move. If you get nervous you don't commit. You place less weight on the hold. You slip. You trust it less and the cycle gets worse. If you commit 100%, their is a greater chance your foot will stick. This article covers some exercises to improve your footwork. 

Typically these are not meant to be messed with. Even if you could get to the knot I'd imagine you would struggle to get it un-done. Basically, in my experience, cutting it is often the best/only solution. Just try and save as much cord as you can. FYI tent pole repair companies will often sell extra cord should you need it. 

You can't really build strength in your toes. There is no major muscle in your toes to build. This is why your shoes support your toes. I would suggest trying to train your toes is a waste of time. If you're experiencing pain, The culprit is probably your shoes. You may need to buy a new pair. This could be because they are too tight, compressing your toes too much or too loose, not supporting your injured toes enough. It's impossible to tell this from here. I would suggest going to a good climbing shop or local climbing gym and talking to someone experienced who will be able to offer advice based on your current shoe and foot shape, etc. This article may provide some helpful insights also Climbing shoes: is pain insane? 

Caravan parks often have safes for people to use (rent). That's likely your best bet. They're often a bit like the lockers you get in swiming baths. Baring that it's either hide things (Bottom of a sleeping bag works ok but obviously your taking a risk) or take anything valuable with you. 

From Nasa I suppose the short answer is the (maximum) amount of rain in a cloud is dependant on the air temperature, relative humidity goes up as the air increases in temperature. Here's a graph: 

This is possibly a little of a generalisation but, why are indoor grades easier than outdoor grades? Having climbed at many many indoor walls (all over the uk) and done multiple outdoor climbs (bouldering and trad) pretty much universally I can climb much higher grades indoors than out. For example at my local gym I I boulder at about V4-5. Outdoors I've completed one V1. In fontainebleu I was struggling at V0. 

You can get good LED torches that have all of the above these days. Small, good output and good battery life. 

It depends what kind of ring it was. If the bird was part of a scientific study then often it will have a phone number/web address to contact (depending on size of the bird). If it is a racing bird (like a racing pigeon) then it will be a club specific ring. The type of ring alters depending on what country/geographic region it was ringing also. For example in the EU there is a coordinated database ($URL$ to report rings. So it's hard to give general advice. Contacting your local bird conservation program will likely be able to give more specific advice for your region (a quick Google by me brought up a few potential organisations in Mexico but I don't speak Spanish very well so you're likely going to get better results) Without wanting to repeat @Escoce's answer I think simply googling the number is a good idea. Take a note of the colour and any other makings also as these are often relevant. 

wild camping in the UK is a gray area. Technically it is illegal to wild camp anywhere (Scotland and Dartmoor are the exceptions it is actually legal to wild camp in any unenclosed area there). Practically though, wild camping is tolerated in most wild areas (unenclosed remote areas like the breacon's). You need to be careful though and obey some simple rules: 

If someone looses their footing they can be swiftly swept down river, if it's very cold they can become unconscious very quickly so the idea of the rope is to prevent this. A hip belay will likely be fine for this. If it's very fast consider constructing an anchor around a tree. Be careful not to pull the person under the water if they do fall. Let the rope slide a little and guide them to the side/shallower water. Once on the other side you probably want to secure both ends of the rope to trees. This way you can haul your kit over separately and the other people can cross secured to this (use a lanyard/cows tail type set up).
