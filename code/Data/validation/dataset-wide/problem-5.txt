You've got a space gun. There's no doubt this idea could work, as the article I linked will tell you. So essentially yes, this contraption of yours is entirely possible (as for whether or not you can use a Space Gun to launch a projectile unnoticed into space, well that might be a good idea to ask in another question, since that seems right up this site's alley) 

Let's say you have the entirety of Earth's nuclear stockpile at your disposal (you don't have to use it all, and if you need it there's an infinite supply of extra ICBMs) and that every weapon you fire will have 100% accuracy as to where it explodes. Is there any way these explosions could take place without causing any environmental (or at the very least Limited) damage to the planet's environment? I'd imagine the problems with this would be that the explosion would either be too high in space for the EMP to affect anything, or too low in the Atmosphere to not cause damage. Am I correct in this, or is a (mostly) worldwide nuclear EMP feasible without causing mass environmental damage? 

ZioByte, touched on it, but a large laser array could do the trick. But it doesn't have to destroy the asteroid, merely heat it to the point of vaporizing part of the asteroid. This vapor will act as a small jet deflecting the asteroid from Earth. 

It depends on the degree of similarity you require and how believable you want your world to be. I am approaching assuming you wish to retain most aspects of Greek culture. Greeks were/are Greeks, as Romans were Romans, because of the lands that shaped them. Art, architecture, diet, language, political spheres, policies, wealth, all are influenced heavily by geography. People in a landlocked, snow capped northern plain would not developed as the Greeks did. Climate and geography for example have been shown to have influence on language. Humid climates promote tonal language, temperature influences volume, thinner air promotes ejectives etc. The mountainous geography of Greece played into the development of the various Greek city states by isolating these ancient cities. The vast coasts of Greece would have effected their diet, their access to trade and thus wealth, the degree of foreign influences etc. In short there is a cause for everything, and if you take the Greeks from their lands, but wish to retain all aspects of their culture you best find reason for it, otherwise it may impact the believability of your world. 

This seems to me the more difficult part. Negligibly senescent humans are a dream of distant future. However, you might want to read up on the wikipedia article about research strategies to neglect age-related damage to human tissue. From the article, you see that DNA mutations, junk protein, cell loss, loss of cell division capability and changes in cell linking protein all contribute to ageing in humans. Cancer and degenerative diseases are common consequences. Summary: In my opinion, the human anatomy is already quite close to that of Thor and the way to get there is theoretically known. However, to reach the desired age, several profound advances in different fields of medicine and biotechnology that are currently far from reality, have to be achieved. 

I don't know much about the Marvel universe, so I am basing the following on the information given in your question. 

Mixed Reactions? As alluded to by Ian, some would approach with caution, while others, as alluded to by Gary, would be far more bullish. Remain Cautious There are untold reasons why one should be cautious, not the least of which is the potential for world destroying paradoxes. Unknown effects on our physical world We would have no way of knowing what potential disaster could unfold from use of this technology. Could it tear at the very fabric of space and time, ripping apart our world? Was it merely luck that the chrononaut who has to come to visit us from the future even made it here in the first place without causing irreparable damage? Whether or not these thoughts would occur to Presidents, MPs or Senators, they would come to the minds of scientists and activists that sit on advisory panels or leader multinational NGOs, and international research institutes. As such there would be a healthy body of people pressuring leaders into methodically researching any potential adverse effects of the technology on the user, and the world as a whole. Temporal War It's not just present day world governments who might seek power, and meddling in the affairs of the chrononaut and his technology might cause an outrage in the future leading to potential repercussive actions. I am thinking of a few Star Trek plots which revolve around guardians of space-time who prevent any interference in timelines. Who can say whether or not any attempted interfering with the time traveler and his technology isn't being monitored in the future. Governments would be right to be concerned with this possibility. Time Paradoxes I wont even go into detail as I think he are aware of this. But For reasons similar to ' Unknown effects on our physical world' I can see a fair amount of public pressure to investigate these. presumable some dialogue would occur between our time traveler and world governments on their own findings from the future on these issues, but I am sure we would try and verify them for the sake of understanding and reassurance. Neutral For a variety of reasons some nations would probably have little reaction to the news. Denial There reasons are varied, whether it would count as blasphemy, or it comes across as an impossibility, majorities in some nations would assuredly refuse to believe it as a true event. Apathetic Acceptance Some governments would accept this as a true, and move on with the matter of the day do to overwhelming pressure to deal with current and very troubling affairs. It may become a back burner issue for nations dealing with disease and famine (even if it presents an opportunity to resolve these issues another way) Take Control More to Gary's point, whether open about it, or keeping it a secret, undoubtedly some nations will seek to control what is the greatest potential military and economic leap forward ever presented to mankind. Some may openly call for its control to have a tool to help prevent complete exploitation by those in the future who now many control our past and as such our futures. This could easily lead to both unilateral and multilateral actions to attempt and control this technology. Some would seek the technology to gain the upper hand against present day enemies. They may even use the guise of controlling the technology to counter those from future, while truly maintaining eyes on today. Whether or not that is through force or negotiation is inevitably up to the whims of your nations, and the perceived nature of the time traveler. Militarily Those who have the power may try through military means to gain access to the technology and time traveler. Covertly More interesting would be those who seek to control it covertly. I could see nations trying to bribe or seduce the time traveler to gain access. Or perhaps nations look forward, planning multi-generational infiltration plans to gaining access to the not-yet-invented machine. To that point perhaps out time traveler is a spy from one of these programs (The paradoxes begin) 

It is not very convenient to include several different ways to produce chemical energy into one organism. On the cellular level, this will entail different metabolic pathways, that may even intervene each other. Better to focus on one method and streamline that one. Furthermore, your algae (almost) already exists: Brown algae have the fastest linear growth of any organism on this plant. The record holder is M. pyrifera. Unfortunately they are restricted to shallow waters as they need to attach to bottom substrate. However, there are Sargassum species, which have a complete free-floating (=pelagic) life cycle: for example S. natans. The goal for your scientist is now to alter the Sargassum species to inherit the insane growth rates of M. pyrifera! And just like that you have a super-growing algae that you can grow without further restrictions in any water tank. These species reproduce only by fragmentation, so no need to be scared about spore contamination. Even without genetically growth enhancement the Sargassum algae today produces crazy amounts of biomass, look at this article: $URL$ PS: If you don't want to grow them in tanks, why not manufacture a huge ocean gyre that traps your enhanced Sargassum in one place, building a huge natural Sargassum farm? Oh wait... 

Simplest thing I can think of is the existence of large and dangerous ocean creatures, large horned whales and the like. Perhaps they are attracted to the movement of the ships on the surface and track them once they enter the deeper waters where they reside. 

Blessed Trinkets From the Church Perhaps you could expand the notion of the soul binding to a body over the course of life, to include any object person keeps close to them at all times. Individuals could keep amulets or rings, blessed by the church, that are meant to protect their soul for some time after death. The length of time for which an amulet will last depends on the materials. The degree to which they can keep the soul safe from supernatural forces may also depend on materials or the level of blessing placed upon it. And of course you could use the price of such protections to generate revenue for the church or if you want to limit who can get their hands on such protection. 

This list is based on this paper: Cognitive ornithology: the evolution of avian intelligence and can be used to explain the development of animal intelligence in general. 

seems not too unlikely. If you compare an average human to a top athlete like Ashton Eaton, the differences are striking. Hence, I would argue that most of what is needed to become "harder, better, faster, stronger" is already embedded in the human genetic code. How do you get all humans to become more like that? Well, only those people mostly resembling Thors anatomy are allowed to reproduce: Forced selection of partners based on individual genetics will help to evolve super humans over time. 

Regarding your question about animals lower down the food-chain developing intelligence, I want to present you Alex. Although Grey Parrots sometimes eat insects, they are generally frugivorous - eating fruits, seeds and the like. Still they show remarkably intelligence, matching the level of apes in cognitive tests. The following reasons are brought forward to explain their intelligence:
