Prioritize Which is more important, the interview or the Ph.D defense ? I'd suggest securing the Ph.D ought to be your sole priority. Why would you take any chance of messing that up ? However, you may have your own reasons for preferring to chase the job, and if you have such a preference then you need to at least ask the company for a date after the Ph.D defense. I'd point out that even if you do the interview you have no assurance you'll get anything from it. How much risk is there associated with doing the interview at a difficult time and how much risk to your Ph.D status ? Worse case scenarios : They say no and you decide to skip the interview. There will be other positions. Don't lock yourself into the mental straight-jacket of feeling you have no option but this position. The alternative worst case is that you really put yourself under insane pressure, try and do both and screw both up. 

You is the operative word here. They probably can. And they probably will dump your client and you quickly. What your employees might accept : 

If it's really open source then forking is something they have to cope with. There's no need for guilt. Note that they would not be operating (or claiming to operate) an open source model of development unless it was beneficial to them. Companies get something from this process, even if it just makes them look "friendly" from the outside. You can fork with a clear conscience if you really, really want to. 

If you are authorized to change these documents and certain you are not changing the intended meaning, then I presume it's OK. However, being certain of the intended meaning is non-trivial and it's easy to alter the meaning without intending to. 

then you answer the question truthfully. Many companies have entirely reasonable policies that employees who have signed an offer letter with a competitor are security liabilities. (Whether you have to volunteer that information depends on your agreement with your current company; read your employee handbook.) It ought to go without saying but I'll say it anyway: Be prepared to be escorted out of the building by security at any moment after you announce your intention to resign. Make sure your personal items are already cleared out or nothing you wouldn't mind leaving behind. Another thing that ought to go without saying: if your current company asks you to sign anything other than your resignation letter or your final paycheque, do not sign it. Some companies will suddenly produce a noncompete agreement on the day that you're leaving that they "forgot" to ask you to sign on your first day. They are not in a position to get you to do anything; they can't legally withhold your pay, and threatening to fire you on your last day seems ineffectual. If they pressure you to sign anything, the right response is: 

Well, if I wanted that, I'd hire someone straight out of college. I want my industry hires to justify their higher cost by being immediately productive. 

and hand it to your manager. Notice that Company A was not mentioned. If anyone asks any nosy questions about your personal life such as where you intend to work next, then the answer is: 

Don't pay for health care during that week. If you get injured, pay for it out of pocket. If the expense is catastrophic then you can sign up for COBRA retroactively up to sixty days after your last day and your coverage extends backwards in time to the day you left your job. It's expensive but it is cheaper than catastrophic care. Do not take my word for it; I am not an expert on COBRA. Today would be a great day to research COBRA and learn for yourself how the program works. You're fine. Go enjoy your vacation, and try to not break any limbs. 

Is this a real problem ? Does it cause real problems or are you simply irritated by the apparent lack of response ? I suspect it causes you very few real problems. 

An interesting statement as it implies it's outside the terms of your contract. If it was in your terms of employment, then they could make it mandatory. So your contract is your friend here. 

Just to point out to you that many people confuse not being sentenced to a punishment (after e.g. an apology to the alleged victim) with the charges being dropped. You need to be clear with yourself whether you were actually found guilty or not guilty or whether the charges were dismissed. These are different things and may affect whether you could get an injunction as I suggest. In apologizing you may in fact have been admitting guilt, which is why I mention this. 

These are both sensible reasons not to change anything. Don't forget that developing a elegant solution that solves minor problems is not going to be seen as a useful idea unless it solves practical problems that really impact overall efficiency. So the takeaway from this is that you may need to accept that the boss made a perfectly reasonable decision based on priorities you need to learn to include in your thinking. 

None. But it might irritate them. OK, they might want to refresh their memories, but then again if they don't already have you in their minds after the interview, your resume is not going to make any difference at this stage. The time to plant yourself in their minds was the interview. Anything after that is too little, too late. 

The bit where you express unhappiness is "I'm disappointed to not have the opportunity to work with you this time", in case that was unclear. 

Again no offense intended but be realistic. Would you do that if you were Bob? I wouldn't! The supposition that Bob will take one for the team and be happy about it is not realistic. Bob will quit and angrily badmouth his former company on social media. 

First: you said in previous questions that you've had health issues including difficulties with anxiety. I fully sympathize with how difficult that can be. I strongly encourage you to look for whatever kind of support system you have available to help mitigate those problems. Any problem gets a lot harder to solve when you have anxiety to deal with. There may be support available through your work, while you still have a job. Talk to your doctor. Use the resources at your disposal. Now, to consider your questions: 

Give huge bonuses for cooperation that leads to good outcomes, and fire people who sabotage their coworkers. Huge bonuses. Like absolutely enormous. You know, like the bonuses that CEOs routinely grant themselves at the expense of the company. 

First off, if this subject interests you, I have a number of articles in my blog queue coming up in the next couple of weeks about how I deal with technical interview questions as an interviewer. To address your specific question: this is not a problem I ask, but suppose it were. Why would I do so? To find out: 

That was the correct response. An even better response would have been "I look forward to receiving your offer letter; please email it to blah@blah.com and I'll give it my prompt attention. Have a nice day, goodbye." 

This is an annoyance to you. Remember your boss doesn't really care if you find your work fulfilling, just that the systems keep working. 

It's a way of showing you are part of a group. Not doing it has the opposite effect. Whether you like it or not you are part of group. There are group norms, and it will be seen as anti-social to not try. Failing isn;t as bad as not trying. Practice will also make you better at it, particularly with counseling guiding you. 

Unfortunately not everyone makes allowances. You were unable to learn skills they take for granted (but also had to learn when they were younger). You may or may not accept this, but you can become an expert at this. It's a matter of willpower and openness to the ideas. 

Translations : they would not send as many staff if they had to pay staff to go. It would eat into profits. And to blazes with the students, is also implied. 

Ask management for a simple partition be be placed at the side of your desk because people going around the corner crowd your desk and it's distracting. This is a very sensible use of partitions - to create a distraction free environment (in relation to your field of view). 

You adapt to it. You have raised the issue. But have you suggested a solution other than what is probably the unrealistic one of expecting the other team to be available on demand to match your schedule ? That's the problem : expectation. Your CEO doesn't want to hear about your problem, they want to hear about a realistic solution. From a comment of yours : 

That's easy; as others have said, put your coworkers who are known to be fit through the process; if the process consistently rejects them, then there's something wrong with the process. But that's not the problem you have. This is a question-and-answer site, and you've asked the wrong question. The problem you actually have is a significant fraction of candidates are plainly unfit, and this is wasting time, effort and money that could be better spent elsewhere. You have a pipeline problem, not a coding question problem. Something in your candidate pipeline is producing a large fraction of plainly unfit candidates. As is well known, a great many programming job applicants have no ability whatsoever to write even simple programs: $URL$ Ask around and see if other interviewers are having similar problems. If they are, then push back on management and recruiting to see if they can figure out what is incentivizing recruiting to keep sending you unqualified candidates. 

You expected fairness and loyalty and thoughtfulness from a corporation. That's a great mistake to learn from, particularly since this mistake cost you nothing. Don't make that mistake again. 

The function of severance is to trade your statement that you will not sue for a lump of cash. Are you willing to sue them? Remember, the point of the PIP is to document why firing you is the right thing to do. 

So don't burn bridges. Be polite and professional. People quit. That's business. If they don't get that, then that's their problem. 

Beyond simple honesty, you tailor your answer the same way you tailor every answer in an interview: by considering the motives of the person doing the interviewing. Presumably they have a business problem and they believe that going to the enormous expense of interviewing and then hiring you, they might have a chance to solve that problem at a reasonable cost. (This is assuming that the interviewer is acting in good faith; see my comment above for thoughts on that.) If you want to make yourself seem attractive, make it clear that your motives are aligned with the business problem that you are solving. (This of course requires that you understand what business problem you are possibly solving in the first place; use the interview as an opportunity to clarify that if it's unclear.) For example, if the position is sales at a car dealership, "I want to make a lot of money" is a perfectly acceptable answer. It shows that your goals and the goals of the business are totally in line. Commission-based sales generates profit for the dealership at the same time as it generates commissions for the seller. It's a terrible answer if you're applying for a job teaching math to high-school students. (Unfortunately.) 

Well, I'd reconsider those choices. I appreciate and respect that you may not want to be on these drugs long term, (I didn't), but in the short term it's part of a necessary treatment to stabilize you and get you functioning better. Therapy may help. It's not a guaranteed cure, but you need to give it a try. Maybe this won't be the right time for it, but keep an open mind. 

As I mentioned above your colleagues "offshore" (from your narrow viewpoint !) are probably equally frustrated by comms from your locale. Your use of the term "offshore" does seem to indicate a failure to appreciate that they're a perfectly legitimate part of a global business and you need to accommodate them, not just the other way around. 

Call an anonymous police tips line. I don't know where you are, but in my country there is a completely anonymous phone number (free) which you can ring to report criminal matters or tips. I would suggest (strongly) that you check if that's possible where you are and ring them if you can. It may take some time to work out the right phrasing or what you're prepared to say, but it's simply a matter of doing something : you have every reason to think someone is being scammed out of a great deal of money (the equivalent of perhaps a years salary !) and you should do what you can to help stop this, IMO. Your should give them, at least, enough information to identify the woman who is being scammed. This needs to be stopped. If necessary report the matter openly. While it may seem a lot to maybe get fired or at least disciplined for doing this, it's a question for your own sense of morality whether you think you have a duty to report this to the authorities (and the lady) rather than cover yourself. There's an old saying for this situation : No good deed goes unpunished. I'm afraid you may have to view this as a risk you're going to have to take.
