The "Prevalence" column shows the rate where one or more third molars (wisdom teeth) are missing. You can see that only one of them (Lee et al, 2009) tops 35%, but there are several that get somewhat close. So even if 35% is a bit high, it's probably correct to say "One estimate says..." 

I believe that if the claim is tweaked slightly, there is some evidence to support it. Originally it says "born without wisdom teeth", which to me sounds like they are missing all of their wisdom teeth. I haven't seen any studies that show that high a rate for that. Also, I believe everybody is "born" without them, since they generally don't start forming until age ten or so. If it's changed to "will not develop one or more wisdom teeth", that's a bit easier to find support for. While this study was mainly looking at specific ethnic variations, they also include a table showing various studies done from 1954 to 2010: 

but it claims that he was nominated in 1995, and lists different supporters. This is not to say that both couldn't be true, but I don't believe you're going to find hard evidence either way. 

It's possible that there is some clown-specific law that I've missed, but it's likely referring to a more general ban against masks and related means of concealing your identity: From Reuters: 

This article, or one like that (in other Russian newspapers) seems to have started this whole thing. Note the mismatch between headline and body text regarding 'injections'. – Conclusion – As an anecdotal evidence Brouchkov claims about his personal health are irrelevant. If he were to market this strain as a probiotic, he'd have a tough time regarding these health claims in many markets. The possible effects claimed more by certain media than by him from a one-time shot of dead bacteria are wholly unlikely. For any effect over the claimed time span the procedure would have to be repeated. Live bacteria might have colonised him (that would be easily testable, but was apparently not carried out) and show beneficial effects (although that too is not very likely to the extent claimed in the articles in question). Most of the possible reasons for "health benefits" given by Brouchkov initially ('the bacteria are old, … therefore you grow older'/'exotic people living where we found them get older than expected…') are just nonsense. More accurate headlines would have to read like: Russian geocryologist (scientist specialising on permafrost soils) finds 3.5 million-year-old bacteria in thawing Siberian soil, assumes after preliminary testing the bacteria's potential as a trendy pro-biotic, eats it, says he is fine. and as a follow up: Global yellow press goes ape over misleading headline involving "Russian Scientist" – For years now, media fails to do basic research and just copies outrageously exaggerated claims over and over – Possible harm to actress Only one effect of this bacterium is crystal clear: it makes you immortal – by getting you into the news. 

The evolutionary aspect is trickier, but it's clear that the trait is inheritable. Sampling shows that it varies tremendously by ethnicity: 

This doesn't clearly say what time period/method they use to get the "baseline trend", so it's hard to give a precise figure, but it's clear that they're adjusting for some sort of previous trend. They also note that the major gains were in demographics consistent with the predicted effects of the law: 

The source they list is a recent report from the New England Journal of Medicine. The 10.3M number is given there, but there are a few other factors to consider. Your main concern seems to be about the historical trend. They say this about that: 

The study that's from goes on to examine specific mutations in the PAX9 gene and their effects relating to dentition, in case you're interested. Note that it doesn't say "they will disappear", just that their formation is based on an inheritable trait. It could go either way from here, as always. 

Still, unless the absorption rate is vastly different for coffee/tea/fruit/etc, coffee should still come out on top. After coffee and tea, the next highest was bananas at only 76 mg. 

In summary, it looks like HuffPo did what most journalists do: Take a single number/soundbite from a paper and report it. There are confounding factors, and the number quoted is jut an estimate, but it's clear they have taken a lot into consideration. It's not just a WAG. 

It is only an estimate made by a forensic expert Harald Voß that 1–2 deaths per million inhabitants are due to autoerotic mishaps, most commonly by asphyxiation (hypoxyphilia). A personal estimate uttered in an interview, there is no "new study" on this, as many new outlets regurgitating this story claim. Every unnatural death in Germany is examined and the results are collected in encoded form by the Federal Statistical Office of Germany. They are then published on pages like these: 

They have tech that is too imprecise to use as a medical device and apply some Big Data calculations to refine these very unreliable measurements. If results are off, it's clearly your own fault. They say so. At least they are now wise enough to not answer curious emails from skeptical inquirers, any more. Because they apparently did one time too many: 

The most dangerous aspect found recently seems to lie in the danger of even catching a prion-disease via urine: A Protease-resistant Prion Protein Isoform is Present in Urine of Animals and Humans Affected with Prion Diseases (2001). While it might be that Western Medicine is a bit prejudiced or uninterested in this regard and just does not look into the matter properly, as long as only ayurvedic practitioners, esotericists and Hindu nationalists continue to claim any health benefits were associated with drinking traditional preparations of cow urine, the known dangers seem to outweigh the dubious claims of benefits. From a theoretical thought experiment perspective that this practice is said to be widely used in India, and India is neither leading in death from drinking cow urine nor leading in successful treatment of cancers: health benefits of drinking cow urine are unfounded. Or in the words of other experts as reported via abc-news:
