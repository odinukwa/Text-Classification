I did a little digging around, and I found a review article that was published in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research in 2010 (So relatively recent), with a full link to the PDF here. The author went through 200+ articles to try and determine the best mechanisms for muscular hypertrophy as noted by the abstract (Emphasis mine): 

I'm a little confused when you say that when running 3-4 times per week, you find it hard to increase the distance, yet when running 2x per week you can increase the distance 1km per fortnight (2 weeks)? That 1km is less than a mile, and should be able to be added each week, not each fortnight. I would recommend going back to 3-4 runs per week, and add distance weekly. The structure would be something like this: Week 1 

Technically speaking, the energy used by the muscles is not glycogen, but the phosphate bonds in adenosine triphosphate (ATP). When energy is needed, one of the phosphate bonds is broken, resulting in an energy release and the creation of the subsequent adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and waste materials. This is one of the main reasons that creatine phosphate works, is that it provides cells with a ready supply of extra phosphate to recreate the ATP from ADP. Glucose is part of this cycle in that it is broken down into pyruvate to feed into the Kreb's cycle. IIRC, one molecule of glucose can provide somewhere around 24 net molecules of ATP. It is the glycogen that is broken apart to provide the glucose. Grohlier is somewhat correct, in that when muscles start to run out of stored glycogen they start relying on blood glucose and release of stored glycogen from the liver, and this can be slower than the immediate availability of muscle glycogen. However, for short burst activity such as weightlifting, the amount of time you spend in the recovery phase between sets is enough to replenish muscle glycogen from circulating blood glucose. It can take anywhere from 60-120 minutes of continuous exercise to completely deplete muscle/blood/liver stores of glycogen (This is commonly known as "bonking" or hitting the wall, another term that is vastly overused, usually incorrectly.) This time can be lengthened if necessary by eating/feeding/drinking. It's also extended by your body adapting to exercise, as your body will start to adapt by storing more glycogen in the muscles. Recursive is correct, once the glycogen is in the muscle, it can only be used by that muscle specifically. So if you do deplete the biceps glycogen (as per your example), the triceps would not be affected much and could still do work. However, it would be impacted somewhat, as your biceps also play a part in triceps movement, and vice versa. You can't ever really work a muscle in "isolation" outside of a lab. 

As far as drafting, it's very effective. You want to be more to the side than directly behind, because of the bow wave effect, but even following toes can help. However, if you find yourself constantly tapping their feet, you need to get out of the draft and find faster feet. Even in a pool, if you watch high level competitions, competitors will hug the lane line to get as much draft effect as they can if they are behind. I would recommend getting out and doing open water swims as practice, and seriously consider a wetsuit. A wetsuit is like legal cheating for swimming. However, don't do it for the first time on a race day. A swimming wetsuit (Don't borrow a surfing one) fits very tight, and can produce hyperventilation and claustrophobia if you're not used to it). As far as workouts, practice doing a short 100m sprint, and then the rest of the distance straight, with occasional sprint surges of 10-15m every so often. This will simulate your race environment, with the start, surging to find feet or drop people, etc. 

You don't really need to follow a specific plan, make up your own. With a 1:31 HM, you've already got pretty decent speed. One of the better "programs" I've seen is from a guy named BarryP on the slowtwitch forums, it's called 3:2:1. Basically, you do 3 short runs, two medium and one long. Each one is double the previous run. So, if your short run is 40 minutes, then your medium run is 1:20, and your long run is 2:00. Start with your longest week (which should be a couple weeks out from your marathon) and work backwards to determine how much time for each run each week. A couple months out (So around late August) start incorporating speed work, pickups, strides, intervals, etc. Make sure you vary terrain, run hills on a regular basis, and you should be fine. 

It may reduce the appearance of your stomach, but you have not actually done anything to reduce it. The vacuum exercise is the primary way to work the transverse abdominus, which is the most interior of the abdominal muscles. It is primarily responsible for holding in the viscera (intestines). If the TVA is not in shape, then it will allow more protrusion than if it is toned and fit, but this is ONLY a visual effect, it has nothing to do with the actual amount of fat present in the abdominal area. 

There are two other places that you can go to check supplements and medications against what is and is not banned. The Global Drug Reference Online (Global DRO) gives guidance on pharmaceutical products, such as if they are banned either in our out of competition (IC and OOC respectively), and other information pertinent. For example, some medications are legal if you take them orally, but illegal if you get an injection. The other site is the Supplement 411 put out by the United States Anti Doping Agency (USADA). This is the organization that works with the US National Governing Bodies (NGB's) to ensure clean athletes in the Olympic umbrella (Pan Olympic, Para Olympic, etc.). You don't necessarily have to register with complete information, however I encourage you to do so as they update the list regularly. Currently, I do not find Matrix Anabolic Gold on the list. That is not 100%, as they may not have tested it yet, but every time I've looked for a known illegal supplement that it is already on the list. 

Your main muscles for cycling are going to be the quadriceps, hamstrings, gluteal and calf muscles. I would recommend the following exercises for these: 

You are not taking into account normal daily activity. BMR is Basal Metabolic Rate, or for a comparison, if you wake up in the morning, don't roll over or anything and just sit there and blink your eyes and breathe in and out all day, that is how many calories you need to sustain yourself. There are minor calories involved in the act of eating, digesting and eliminating. In addition, you get up and move around during the day, go to work, school, whatever. A "typical" desk job will burn ~ 34 calories an hour. So if you work an 8 hour day, that is ~ 280 calories. Now your exercise goal is 420 calories, not 700. Everything you do besides just breathe uses calories, and you need to factor them all in to get an accurate estimation of your true calorie needs. Edit: Also, just a quick peek, I'm not sure what you mean by a "brisk" walk, but walking at 4.5 miles per hour will burn about 425 calories per hour for a 200 lb person (14 stone is 196 lbs). Add that to the desk job and you are at your goal. 

As a personal example, I have a background in exercise kinesiology, and have coached/trained for many years. I still hire an outside coach for some of my sports, simply because I don't have the experience in that area, and I find that having that outside accountability makes me less likely to skip a workout when I'm tired. So if money is not a constraint, and you want to give it a try, you can certainly give it a go and then reassess in a few months to gauge your progress. If you aren't really increasing any faster than you were on your own, you can save the $$ and move on. 

Once you get your (suspected) form issues cleaned up and get some good structure to your workouts, your times will drop dramatically. It will also improve your triathlon times, as you won't get out of the water already tired. 

Ketogenic diets are of questionable benefit unless done for medical reasons (Such as an attempt to control epilepsy). Studies of ketogenic diets have had very mixed results. If you only eat 160g of protein, that is a daily intake of 640 calories, which is borderline starvation diet. That isn't really a desirable outcome either. Fat is essential, but if you keep eating ~ 1600 calories a day of fat, you're going to have other health problems. Consuming that much fat will start to result in other conditions, especially if done for a prolonged period of time. Metabolism is not a 1:1 relationship, i.e. if I don't eat 200g of fat, my body will take 200g of fat to make it up from stores. The body basically decides what and where it will take from to get the nutrients and energy that it needs. If it opts to take it from muscle, it will. All that you will do if you eat nothing but protein is force your body to take what it needs from where ever it can find it. Studies have shown many times that the type of diet is almost irrelevant, whether it's Atkins, South Beach, grapefruit, ketogenic, whatever. Simple calorie restriction is the single most important factor. Eat a healthy diet of varied elements (Shop the edges of the store), ensure you get enough protein and keep the 10-20% calorie reduction, and you will see desirable results. Given that you are weighlifting, that may be higher than BMI charts (Which are notoriously unreliable for athletic/muscular bodies) say you should be, but let the mirror and your health be the best guide. Given the question regarding the Inuit diet which is routinely 50-75% fat based depending on season; the Inuit diet is high in fats that are monounsaturated and very high in Omega-3. Unless someone is eating wild caught seal/fish/walrus, it's going to be much higher in saturated fats, which is very common in Western diets and unhealthy. The Inuit diet also varies from 50-75% fat depending on season, the diet described in the question is a straight 65-70% from fat daily. And, while the Inuit may not have the health problems most commonly related to high fat intake, they do suffer from obesity, which negates the weight loss that is desired. 

Rather than adding more sessions, I would start adding more time to your current runs. Also, pay attention to your pacing. Most of your running should be fairly easy, distance running is a sport that relies more on volume than it does intensity, so I would look at increasing your distance in the current sessions. Even in your longer, easy runs, you can add some pickups/strides in small amounts. However, the biggest problem with runners is that they go too hard on their easy days, and not hard enough on their hard days. I would have two higher intensity sessions a week, one of threshold type work, and one of interval type work. Intervals are at or faster than race pace, with long rest so that you can make the time interval, and threshold is slightly slower than race pace on shorter rest. Both of these done as part of a workout program will both increase your top end speed (intervals) and increase the time that you can spend at race pace (threshold). Separate them by a couple days each with easy effort runs. 

The biggest question is going to be time to train. 1 minute is quite a large chunk to shave off in six months. I am assuming that your 3:30 time is an all out sprint, which suggests that you have some stroke flaws that are costing you time as well. I would be prepared to live in the pool for the next few months, 4-6 times per week with 2-3000m (or yards depending on your pool) per session. Ideally you want to be around 18,000 per week as an average, more if you can manage it. Many high school swimmers are in the 25-30,000 range per week, often more, and college/Olympic swimmers get up into the 10,000 per day range. I would structure it along the lines of: Monday - Interval work Tuesday - Distance Wednesday - Threshold Thursday - Distance/threshold Friday - Interval Saturday - Distance Sunday - off. On your interval days, I would spend a lot of time doing short distances (25-100m), at speeds faster than your 200m race pace. Threshold days, somewhat longer (100m-300m) at near race pace, and the distance days, 200-500m sets. Along with that, every day I would have form drills (See below note), and kicking drills. Lots and lots of kicking drills. The shorter the race, the more the kick is important as a driving/propulsion force, and a well coordinated kick also drives breathing and stroke rotation, which will in turn increase the length of your reach, distance per stroke, etc. One other aspect that is often overlooked is flip turns. With a 50m pool, there are only 3, but often you can make or lose significant ground in a flip turn depending on form. You need to be able to come into the wall, do your flip turn and then push off and dolphin kick away. You want to be able to come deep enough to get under the wave that follows you into the wall. I would highly recommend a couple of sessions with a swim stroke instructor (not a coach), with the specific purpose of recommending form drills to work on any flaws. This will be worth months in the pool, and can shave off significant time. Have them look at your freestyle (Technically it's the Australian crawl) stroke, flip turns and dolphin kick. If you are stuck for workouts, there are many internet sources available, and I highly recommend the "Swim workouts in a binder" series. Many good workouts, and it has a way to structure/time your threshold and interval workouts off of T (threshold) pace testing. 

Without being able to see a video, those are the most common things I've seen when teaching adults to swim properly. I would highly recommend that you get with someone that knows how to instruct swimming and have them evaluate you. 

Unfortunately, this is very much individually determined, but there are a few things that you can look out for. If you have persistent soreness, it may not be healed or may not be healed properly. If that is the case, you may need to visit your health care provider and possibly be referred to a specialist. If you still note weakness, that may or may not be unusual. If you can't use a muscle or limb for a long time, there can be significant muscle atrophy on that side, and without diligent training specifically to address this, it may be a long term weakness. Normally breaks heal and can even be stronger than surrounding areas, but if you are still noticing weakness and tenderness it might be a good time to revisit the doctor/physical therapist. Just as an n=1 experience, I ruptured my achilles and was unable to use the calf for 3 months. When they took all the casts/boots off, my calf was the size of my wrist. 4 years later, I have a full recovery but it's still not quite the same strength as the other leg.
