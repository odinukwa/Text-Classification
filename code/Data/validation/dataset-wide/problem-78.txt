Go ranged. The ol' slingshot and rocks would be a decent weapon, capable of injuring any part of the body from afar without having to burden the user with too much weight and entangling their own wings and limbs with longer or unwieldy weapons. If the opponent is lightly armored (can't be very heavy since the winged human would not even be able to fly", then you would need to just need to hit their wings to make them fall or "stagger" them. You can even use short bows if this makes more sense in your world, then you can have poisoned tipped arrows and such. For the occasional melee fighting, use a "tari" or what they call "chicken knives" used on illegal cockfights. Basically a sharp hooked blade attached at the back of the ankles to to slashing attacks and since its on the legs, you can also use your arms to punch, slash, stab or any use other martial art or weapon you can think of. Makes for an interesting fighting style. 

You can also explore the possibility of increased gravity. Creatures from a world with a high gravity would be either become smaller or larger. See this Reddit ($URL$ It really depends on how you want the outcome to be. If the stronger/higher gravity was not sudden then life would evolve to fit the environment and that would include denser bones, probably larger lungs and multiple hearts to support the body, muscle density becomes higher and would make creatures larger. I've read a few books I think it was Pip and Flynx by Alan Dean Foster (don't quote me on this) where one of his species was large and strong due to living in a higher gravity world. 

Are there any other events which would make 2014 significantly different without the Black Death than it is now? 

The black death wiped out anywhere between 20% and 50% of the human population, and so without it obviously the world population would be billions more than it is now. What I'm more interested in is how else history would be different without it, some notable related events include: 

Faster than light travel is Dangerous with a capital D. The main reason for this is because by the time you see something, you've already smashed into it and vaporised yourself, the target and any unfortunates in the general vicinity, as well as releasing all those crazy science particles inside the fuel tanks which could react in new and devastating ways depending on what you hit. Smart aliens let computers work out the timing and control the engines to make sure this doesn't happen, but the Dum-d'uums have just bought their first FTL engine from some passing space merchants, and unfortunately they aren't patient enough to configure the computer before trying out their new toy. The nearest inhabited planet to the Dum-d'uums' is called Switzerland (it's just a coincidence) and they are a ridiculously peaceful and scientifically advanced race who heard about the deal and just know that the Dum-d'uums are going to mess up their space lawn. How would the Swiss protect themselves from a FTL impact without breaking their moral code and resorting to the obvious (to us evil non-Swiss, anyway) answers of 'sabotage their space program' or 'force field protection grid so the crash isn't near our stuff'? 

Ok maybe not mechs, but exosuits. Powered limbs, pressurized suit, armored protection, comms, manueveraibility via jets placed on the feet and back. The suit would have to be large though so a 1.8 meter person would probably bulk to about 2.5 to 3 meters or so (rough estimate based on eyeballing existing spacesuits). They'd be armed with grappling hooks they can throw, mini-rockets (careful of that recoil) and maybe a knife or two for close combat. Not sure how much damage they can do to a medium to heavy armored station, base or craft though since arming themselves with heavy missiles might be too cumbersome and problematic given space's physics. Mines and explosives though may be feasible. Anyway, point is, you can use exosuits and they can look more mecha if you want and if they have specialized roles then you can alter their look and feel too. 

How can a population or civilization develop empathy to the point where they feel another beings emotion if they are only a few feet away regardless of species and even if they are familiar with the emotion or not. The only limitation is that they cannot broadcast emotions, just receive them. The level of empathy ability I am looking at is above what humans have today. More in line with strong telekinesis or telepathic abilities. 

I am writing a story where a species undergoes devolution. Is there any scientific or plausible way to do this? The process can be instantaneous or may take ages, I do not mind which as I need to weigh my options at this stage. To be clear, the devolution I am thinking of is like taking a human being then devolving him/her to the primate stage, so lets say about as far back as Orrorin tugenensis or Paranthropus where they are in the midst of evolving from primates to Homo erectus. Please note I used human beings as an example to give context but the species undergoing devolution may not necessarily be human. Based on the answers, "devolution" does not exist so had the word in quotes to reflect this. 

I think the best way to accomplish goals two and three together is to have passive rewinders only aware of the future on a subconscious level: Those with the ability who are brought along during someone elses rewind can only notice on a conscious level when they see a divergence with their own eyes. Simply put, if you have the power and a rewinder brings you back in time, you can't tell. That is, until you witness a divergence in the timeline, at this point the rewinder will see a person or object split, a ghostly form carrying on with their original behaviour, while the corporeal version doing their new behaviour. Upon witnessing this, the rewinder will then know that someone else is using their ability to alter the past in a way which will effect them. This way, it's very difficult for those with powers to fight each other, as if you were about to lose and rewind, your opponent will see the ghostly version of himself beat you and do the same thing. Advanced rewinders could also use this as an advantage against newer rewinders by continually rewinding the last minute and filling the room with ghost fighters as a distraction. However, this doesn't completely make rewinders immune to each other, as a seriously clever puppet master type could theoretically defeat another rewinder if they can come up with a convoluted plot which changes the past of the rewinder without directly effecting anyone that the rewinder sees (e.g. the puppetmaster messes with the phone lines at the local exchange so when the rewinder gets called in the morning, the lines switch with a sex chat line, which distracts the rewinder enough to make him late enough that he doesn't have time to foil the puppetmaster's plans, nor will he have a chance to run into his ghost future self who did foil the plot). 

To ensure "genetic" variation Let's look at why there are two sexes in humans and many (most?) other animals. Why did we go from cells that copy themselves, to large organisms that actually need to mate with other large organism to reproduce? Well, one reason might be to diversify the gene pool. If one creature keeps cloning himself, and those clones keep cloning themselves, you ultimately end up with an entire species that are all pretty much the same. Which is fine as long as the environment doesn't change, but if suddenly the environment changes to one that is bad for one of the species, it could be the downfall of the entire species. The only hope for such a species is a few errors during copying, so that the small amount of mutant might thrive while the rest dies. That's why two-gender reproduction is quite useful. When two people have children, they can be anywhere between 100% parent1 and 100% parent2, and with tons of errors as well, because of the inherent difficulty of combining genes from two parents. This leads to a species that is basically full of mutants, so much so that you can have them in many different colors, lengths, strengths and weaknesses. Many of them will be inferior given normal condition, but the species is extremely well suited to handle large environmental changes. So maybe your android society 1.0 actually didn't have any genders, but due to some environmental change they all become obsolete or inferior. After which they started to introduce "intentional bugs", random errors that would create "mutants" within the society. But the problem with these mutants was that they simply could not compete with their perfect counterparts during "normal" circumstances, so they were never reproduced. Finally, they decided to split the society into two genders: mutants and clones. Mutants are created by taking the average of both parents genes*, and then adding random errors to them. Clones are creating by simply taking anywhere between 25% and 75% of the genes* of either parents, without errors. And only mutants and clones can reproduce together, to make sure that you do not end up with a society full of clones, but still a society that values clones of succesful androids. It's a flimsy story full of holes, but frankly if you insist on putting sexes/genders into your android-story (which feels a bit like putting teenage girls into your werewolf story) this might be your best solution. Also note that I am by no means a biologist, and you should definately fact check me about why there are even different sexes to begin with. *genes being the "source code" or "design specification".
