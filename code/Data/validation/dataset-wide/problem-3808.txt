Let me construct a non-paracompact counterexample. Of course, a paracompact counterexample is better in many respects since differential topology is usually restricted to paracompact manifolds and because the manifolds that naturally occur and the ones sold here are all paracompact. Let $L=([0,1)\times\omega_{1})\setminus\{(0,0)\}$ be the long line. Let $M$ be any paracompact manifold with the fixed point property for homeomorphisms. For instance, $M$ could be a projective space over the reals, the complex numbers, or over the quaternions. Let $N=L\times M$. I claim that $N$ has the fixed point property for homeomorphisms but not for continuous maps. Clearly, there is a retraction $f:N\rightarrow S$ where $S\simeq M\times(0,1]$. The set $M\times(0,1]$ does not have the fixed point property since the map $M\times(0,1]\rightarrow M\times(0,1],(x,y)\mapsto(x,y/2)$ has no fixed point. Therefore there is some map $g:S\rightarrow S$ without a fixed point. Thus $g\circ f:N\rightarrow S$ has no fixed point. Now assume that $h:N\rightarrow N$ is a homeomorphism. If $x\in M$, then let $\Gamma_{x}:L\rightarrow L,\Delta_{x}:L\rightarrow L$ be the maps where $\Gamma_{x}(y)=\pi_{1}(h(y,x)),\Delta_{x}(y)=\pi_{1}(h(y,x))$. Let $C_{x}=\{\alpha\in\omega_{1}|\Gamma_{x}(\alpha,0)=(\alpha,0)\},D_{x}= \{\alpha\in\omega_{1}|\Delta_{x}(\alpha,0)=(\alpha,0)\}.$ I claim that the sets $C_{x},D_{x}$ are club sets (club stands for closed unbounded). It is clear that the sets $C_{x},D_{x}$ are closed, so we now need to show $C_{x},D_{x}$ are unbounded. It is easy to see that for all $\alpha\in\omega_{1}$, we have $\Gamma_{x}(z)>(0,\alpha)$ for sufficiently large $z$. Therefore, for all $\alpha\in\omega_{1}$ there is a sequence $(y_{n})_{n}$ with $(0,\alpha)<y_{0}$ and where $y_{n}<y_{n+1},y_{n}<\Gamma_{x}(y_{n+1}),\Gamma_{x}(y_{n})<y_{n+1},\Gamma_{x}(y_{n})<y_{n+1}$. Furthermore, one can choose the sequence $(y_{n})_{n}$ so that $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}y_{n}=(0,\gamma)$ for some $\gamma$. Therefore, we have $\Gamma_{x}(0,\gamma)=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\Gamma_{x}(y_{n})=(0,\gamma)$. We conclude that $\gamma\in C_{x}$, so $C_{x}$ is unbounded. Thus $C_{x}$ is a club set. The set $D_{x}$ is a club set as well by an identical argument. Let $A\subseteq M$ be a countable dense subset. Then let $E=\bigcap_{x\in X}C_{x}\cap D_{x}$. Then $E$ is a club set being the countable intersection of club sets. Now assume that $\alpha\in E$. Then since $(\alpha,0)=\Delta_{x}(\alpha,0)=\pi_{1}(h((\alpha,0),x)$ for $x\in X$, we have $h[\{(\alpha,0)\}\times X]\subseteq\{(\alpha,0)\}\times M$. Therefore, we have $h[\{(\alpha,0)\}\times M]=h[\overline{\{(\alpha,0)\}\times X}]\subseteq\{(\alpha,0)\}\times M$. Similarly, we have $h^{-1}[\{(\alpha,0)\}\times M]\subseteq\{(\alpha,0)\}\times M$. Therefore, $\{(\alpha,0)\}\times M\subseteq h[\{(\alpha,0)\}\times M]$. We conclude that $h[\{(\alpha,0)\}\times M]=\{(\alpha,0)\}\times M$. However, since $M$ has the fixed point property for homeomorphisms, and $h[\{(\alpha,0)\}\times M]=\{(\alpha,0)\}\times M$, the mapping $h$ has some fixed point on $\{(\alpha,0)\}\times M$. 

$X$ is a compact zero-dimensional space $A_{x}$ is a structure for each $x\in X$ $A\subseteq\prod_{x\in X}A_{x}$ is a subalgebra where $\pi_{x}[A]=A_{x}$ whenever $\pi_{x}:\prod_{x\in X}A_{x}\rightarrow A_{x}$ is the projection. whenever $f_{1},...,f_{n}\in A$ and $(C_{1},...,C_{n})$ is a partition of $X$ into clopen sets, then $f_{1}|_{C_{1}}\cup...\cup f_{n}|_{C_{n}}\in A$ whenever $\phi$ is a formula and $f_{1},...,f_{n}\in A$, then $\{x\in X|A_{x}\models\phi(f_{1}(x),...,f_{n}(x))\}$ is a clopen subset of $X$, 

Let $\mathbb{N}\cup\{\infty\}$ denote the one-point compactification. Give $\mathbb{N}\cup\{\infty\}$ the partial ordering where $m>n$ if and only if $m$ is even, $n$ is odd and $|m-n|=1$. In other words, we give $\mathbb{N}$ a zig-zag ordering and we let $\infty$ be a point which is not comparable to any point of $\mathbb{N}$. Then it is easy to verify that $\mathbb{N}\cup\{\infty\}$ is a Priestley space with this partial ordering. However, the order component $\mathbb{N}$ is not closed. 

Much of the work of Paul Bankston is about ultraproducts of topological spaces, so I suggest that you look at his work. See the paper [1] for an introduction of the ultraproduct construction of topological spaces. Suppose that $(X_{i},\mathcal{T}_{i})$ is a topological space for each $i\in I$ and $M$ is an ultrafilter on $I$. Then $\prod_{i\in I}X_{i}/M$ may be given the topology generated by $\prod_{i\in I}U_{i}/M$ where $U_{i}\in\mathcal{T}_{i}$ for $i\in I$ which is called the ultraproduct of the topological spaces $(X_{i},\mathcal{T}_{i})$. The ultraproduct construction preserves separation axioms including Hausdorff axioms, regular spaces, and completely regular spaces. The ultraproduct of regular spaces by a non-$\sigma$-complete ultrafilter is always a $P$-space (A $P$-space is a regular space where every $G_{\delta}$-set is open). Most topological spaces that mathematicians encounter in nature are not $P$-spaces, so I am unsure if you would consider these spaces as being natural (I consider the ultraproduct construction of new topological spaces to be natural simply because it preserves the separation axioms. Furthermore, since ultrafilters are ). If you want a construction that preserves compactness, then you should look at the ultracoproduct construction instead of the ultraproduct. If you want a construction that preserves metric spaces (or more generally uniform spaces (uniform spaces have local bases which can be index by the same ordering as you want)), then you should probably look at the notion of an ultralimit of metric spaces. 

Although the above theorem is stated in terms of compact zero-dimensional spaces it seems like the above result should hold for all compact Hausdorff spaces, but I am unaware of anyone who has worked out the details. 

$\textbf{Ideas of proof}$ A proof of these facts is given in the paper Topological reduced products via good ultrafilters by Paul Bankston. A proof of 1 uses basic facts about regular ultrafilters. A proof of 2 uses the fact that the ultraproduct of models by a $\lambda$-good ultrafilter is saturated. $\textbf{The failure of the Baire property}$ One might expect for $\kappa$-compact $P_{\kappa}$-spaces to be Baire spaces, or complete uniform spaces generated by a linearly ordered set of entourages (i.e. generalized metric spaces) to be Baire spaces. Unfortunately, this is not the case. In fact, for most $P_{\kappa}$-spaces it is easy to find a closed subspace that is not even a Baire space. If $X$ is a $P_{\kappa}$-space, and there is a sequence of closed subsets $C_{n}$ where $C_{n}$ is nowhere dense in $C_{n+1}$ for all $n$, then $\bigcup_{n}C_{n}$ is a closed subspace of $X$ and each $C_{n}$ is nowhere dense in $\bigcup_{n}C_{n}$, so $\bigcup_{n}C_{n}$ is not a Baire space. Let $X_{n}$ be a $P_{\kappa}$-space for all natural numbers $n>0$ and $x_{n}\in X_{n}$ be a non-isolated point for all $n$. Give $X=\prod_{n\in\mathbb{N}}X_{n}$ the box topology. Then $\prod_{n\in\mathbb{N}}X_{n}$ becomes a $P_{\kappa}$-space with this topology. For natural numbers $N$, let $C_{N}\subseteq\prod_{n\in\mathbb{N}}X_{n}$ consist of all sequences $(y_{n})_{n}$ such that $y_{n}=x_{n}$ whenever $n>N$. Then $C_{N}\simeq X_{1}\times...\times X_{N}$. Let $C=\bigcup_{N}C_{N}$. Then $C$ is not a Baire space. On the other hand, if each $X_{n}$ is $\kappa$-compact, then each finite product $X_{1}\times...\times X_{n}\simeq C_{n}$ is $\kappa$-compact, so $C$ is $\kappa$-compact. Furthermore, if each $X_{n}$ can be given a complete uniformity generated by a linearly ordered set of cofinality $\kappa$, then $C$ can also be given a complete uniformity generated by a linearly ordered set of cofinality $\kappa$ (i.e. $C$ is like a complete metric space), but $C$ is still not a Baire space. $\textbf{An application of generalized Baire spaces}$ In this section, I will give motivation for the Baire property for $P_{\kappa}$-spaces in terms of point-free topology and Boolean algebras. The notions in this section come from my own personal research. Recall that a frame is a complete lattice that satisfies the distributive law $x\wedge\bigvee_{i\in I}y_{i}=\bigvee_{i\in I}(x\wedge y_{i})$. Frames are the main objects of study in point-free topology since if $(X,\mathcal{T})$ is a topological space, then $\mathcal{T}$ is a frame. If $L,M$ are frames, then a frame homomorphism from $L$ to $M$ is a function $f:L\rightarrow M$ such that $f(0)=0,f(1)=1,f(\bigvee R)=\bigvee f[R],f(x\wedge y)=f(x)\wedge f(y)$ for each $R\subseteq L$ and $x,y\in L$. Frame homomorphisms from $L$ to $M$ correspond roughly to continuous functions from $M$ to $L$. A frame $L$ shall be called $\kappa$-distributive if whenever $|I|<\kappa$ and $R_{i}\subseteq L$ for $i\in I$, then $\bigwedge_{i\in I}\bigvee R_{i}=\bigvee\{\bigwedge_{i\in I}x_{i}|x_{i}\in R_{i}\,\textrm{for}\,i\in I\}.$ It can be shown that a $T_{1}$-space is $\kappa$-distributive if and only if the intersection of less than $\kappa$ many open sets is open. Therefore, the notion of $\kappa$-distributivity is a way to generalize the notion of a $P_{\kappa}$-space to point-free topology. It turns out that the surjective image of a $\kappa$-distributive frame under a frame homomorphism is not necessarily $\kappa$-distributive. On the other hand, one may characterize the completely regular $\kappa$-distributive frames $L$ such that the image of $L$ under a surjective frame homomorphism is $\kappa$-distributive, and this characterization requires the Baire property. We shall state the results here for topological spaces. $\mathbf{Proposition}$ (Sikorski) Let $X$ be a $P_{\kappa}$-space. Then the regular open algebra $\mathrm{Ro}(X)$ is $\kappa$-distributive if and only if $X$ is a $\kappa$-Baire space. 

I am wondering if there are some first order theories of algebraic structures or structures of interest to model theorists of large cardinal consistency strength or at least unexpectedly high consistency strength if the large cardinal heirarchy is not reached. I am very much interested in theories of groups, modules, lattices, etc with possibly extra structure. I am not as much interested in theories such as Peano arithmetic or some other variant of arithmetic. Also, I prefer finitely axiomatized theories. Example In Jech and Dougherty's paper Finite left-distributive algebras and embedding algebras, the authors develop some basic facts about two kinds of structures which they call two-sorted embedding algebras and extended two-sorted embedding algebras. The two-sorted embedding algebras and extended two-sorted embedding algebras are both axiomatized by finitely many first order axioms and such axiomatizations seem very natural to me. Every extended two-sorted embedding algebra is a two-sorted embedding algebra and every two sorted embedding algebra in which every ordinal is a critical point can be extended to an extended two-sorted embedding algebra. Let $A_{n}$ denote the $n$-th classical Laver table. If $(1)_{n\in\omega}\in\varprojlim_{n\in\omega}A_{n}$ freely generates a left-distributive algebra, then there exists a two-sorted embedding algebra. On the other hand, it is unknown (or at least was unknown) whether the existence of a two-sorted embedding algebra implies that $(1)_{n\in\omega}\in\varprojlim_{n\in\omega}A_{n}$ freely generates a left-distributive algebra. Therefore, the consistency strength of the theory of two-sorted embedding algebras is completely unknown and falls somewhere below the statement (for all $n\in\omega$ there is an $n$-huge cardinal). 

Suppose that $X$ is a self-distributive algebra with an element $1$ such that $1*x=x,x*1=1$ for $x\in X$. Then let $\preceq^{X}$ be the smallest pre-ordering on $X\setminus\{1\}$ such that $x\preceq^{X}x*y$ whenever $x,y\in X,x\neq 1,x*y\neq 1$. Let $\mathcal{E}_{\lambda}^{+}$ denote the set of all non-trivial elementary embeddings $j:V_{\lambda}\rightarrow V_{\lambda}$. Then we say that a collection $(j_{x})_{x\in X}$ of elementary embeddings has the branching property if for all limit ordinals $\gamma<\lambda$, the partial ordering $\preceq^{\langle\{j_{x}|x\in X\}\rangle/\equiv^{\gamma}}$ is a tree whose roots are precisely the elements $[j_{x}]_{\gamma}$ where $\mathrm{crit}(j_{x})<\gamma$. Suppose that $X$ is an index set and $j_{x}\in\mathcal{E}_{\lambda}^{+}$ for each $x\in X$. Then does there exist a forcing extension $V[G]$ such that in $V[G]$ there are elementary embeddings $\overline{j_{x}}:V[G]_{\lambda}\rightarrow V[G]_{\lambda}$ such that $\overline{j_{x}}$ extends $j_{x}$ for each $x\in X$ and in $V[G]$ the system $(\overline{j_{x}})_{x\in X}$ has the branching property? This question has obvious several generalizations such as when the elementary embeddings are maps $j:V_{\lambda+1}\rightarrow V_{\lambda+1}$, so I am also looking for answers in these generalized cases. 

The reduced permutative LD-systems have a notion of a composition operation. In particular, if $x,y\in X$, then we can define $x\circ y=t_{n+1}(x,y)$ where $n$ is a natural number such that $t_{n}(x,y)=1$. The reduced permutative LD-systems have a notion of a critical point. We define $\textrm{crit}(x)\leq \textrm{crit}(y)$ if there exists some $n$ where $x^{n}*y=1$. The notion of a critical point is very well behaved for reduced permutative algebras since critical points in reduced permutative LD-systems satisfy most of the main properties that critical points of rank-into-rank embeddings satisfy. Furthermore, the notion of a critical point in reduced permutative LD-systems is not just a generalization from set theory to algebra but the notion of a critical point in a reduced permutative LD-system is an essential part of the theory of permutative LD-systems. Every algebra of the form $\mathcal{E}_{\lambda}/\equiv^{\gamma}$ is a reduced permutative LD-system. 

This depends on how which fundamental operations and relations you want on the natural numbers to begin with. For instance, if you have at most countably many operations on $\mathbb{N}$, then you can easily get many elementary substructures. Take note that any ultrapower $\mathbb{N}^{\mathcal{U}}$ by a non-principal ultrafilter $\mathcal{U}$ on a countable set has cardinality continuum. Take for instance $(\lfloor nr\rfloor)_{n}/\mathcal{U}$ as $r$ ranges over the positive real numbers. This set will have cardinality continuum. Therefore by the Lowenheim-Skolem theorem, the ultrapower $\mathbb{N}^{\mathcal{U}}$ has many countable elementary substructures that properly extend $\mathbb{N}$. On the other hand, if you let all operations on $\mathbb{N}$ be fundamental operations and all relations be fundamental operations, then it is possible that $\mathbb{N}^{\mathcal{U}}$ has no non-trivial elementary substructures, and we shall be able to characterize the elementary substructures of $\mathbb{N}$. Let $\Omega(\mathbb{N})$ be the structure with underlying set $\mathbb{N}$ and where each operation is a fundamental operation, each constant is a fundamental constant, and each relation is a fundamental relation. We first take note if $\mathcal{A}$ is a model of $\mathrm{Th}(\Omega(\mathbb{N}))$, then every substructure of $\mathcal{A}$ is an elementary substructure. If $f:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathbb{N}$, then let $\Pi(f)$ be the partition of $\mathbb{N}$ where $x=y\,(\Pi(f))$ if and only if $f(x)=f(y)$. Let $\mathcal{U}$ be a non-principal ultrafilter over $\mathbb{N}$. Let $\mathrm{Sub}(\Omega(A)^{\mathcal{U}})$ denote the lattice of elementary substructres of $\Omega(A)^{\mathcal{U}}$. Let $\Pi(\mathbb{N})$ denote the lattice of partitions of $\mathbb{N}$. In particular, $\Pi(\mathbb{N})$ is a meet-semilattice. Let $\Theta_{\mathcal{U}}$ be the congruence on the meet-semilattice $\Pi(\mathbb{N})$ where $(P,Q)\in\Theta_{\mathcal{U}}$ if and only if there is some $R\in\mathcal{U}$ where $\{A\cap R|A\in P\}\setminus\{\emptyset\}=\{B\cap R|B\in Q\}\setminus\{\emptyset\}$.` Then let $\Pi(\mathbb{N})/\mathcal{U}$ denote the quotient meet-semilattice $\Pi(\mathbb{N})/\Theta_{\mathcal{U}}$. Let $\mathrm{Fi}(\Pi(\mathbb{N})/\mathcal{U})$ denote the lattice of filters on the meet-semilattice $\Pi(\mathbb{N})/\mathcal{U}$. Define a map $L:\mathrm{Fi}(\Pi(\mathbb{N}))\rightarrow\mathrm{Sub} (\Omega(\mathbb{N})^{\mathcal{U}})$ by letting $L(Z)=\{[f]\in\Omega(\mathbb{N})^{\mathcal{U}}:\Pi(f)/\Theta_{\mathcal{U}}\in Z\}$. Then $L$ is an order reversing bijection, and this bijection restricts to a bijection between the principal filters on the meet-semilattice $L$ and the finitely generated substructures of $\Omega(\mathbb{N})^{\mathcal{U}}$. The finitely generated substructures of $\Omega(\mathbb{N})^{\mathcal{U}}$ are generated by a single element, and the finitely generated substructures of $\Omega(\mathbb{N})^{\mathcal{U}}$ correspond to the structures obtained by going down from $\mathcal{U}$ on the Rudin-Keisler preordering. Every elementary substructure of $\Omega(\mathbb{N})^{\mathcal{U}}$ is obtained by going down from $\mathcal{U}$ on the Rudin-Kiesler preordering if and only if the meet-semilattice $\Pi(\mathbb{N})/\mathcal{U}$ satisfies the descending chain condition. This condition is equivalent to the following restatement: if $(P_{n})_{n}$ is a sequence of partitions with $P_{n}\preceq P_{n-1}$ for all $n$, then there is some $N$ where if $n\geq N$, then there is some $R_{n}\in\mathcal{U}$ where if $A\in P_{n+1}$, then there is some $B\in P_{n}$ with $A\cap R_{n}=B\cap R_{n}$ (do these kinds of ultrafilters have a name?). I should note that the one-to-one correspondence between $\mathrm{Fi}(\Pi(\mathbb{N})/\mathcal{U})$ and $\mathrm{Sub}(\Omega(\mathbb{N})^{\mathcal{U}})$ can be generalized to different kinds of ultrapower constructions and even reduced power constructions including Boolean ultrapowers, limit ultrapowers, limit reduced powers, etc. As a side note, I personally have found this characterization of subalgebras useful for studying things such as the Boolean ultrapower and determining when a Boolean ultrapower is an ultrapower. For example, an ultrafilter $\mathcal{U}$ on $\mathbb{N}$ is selective if and only if the lattice $\Pi(\mathbb{N})/\mathcal{U}$ has only two elements, and selective ultrafilters are precisely the ultrafilters such that $\Omega(A)^{\mathcal{U}}$ has no elementary substructures besides $\Omega(A)$ and $\Omega(A)^{\mathcal{U}}$. Selective ultrafilters may be constructed using the continuum hypothesis. On the other hand, if $(P_{n})_{n}$ is a descending sequence of partitions of $\mathbb{N}$, where if $A\in P_{n}$, then $\{B\in P_{n+1}|B\subseteq A\}$ is infinite, then it is easily shown that there is an ultrafilter $\mathcal{U}$ such that $P_{n+1}/\Theta_{\mathcal{U}}\neq P_{n}/\Theta_{\mathcal{U}}$ for all $n$. 

If $x\in A_{n}$, then let $o_{n}(x)$ denote the least natural number $m$ such that $x*_{n}2^{m}=2^{n}$. There are typically very few elements $x\in A_{n}$ where $o_{n}(x)=5$. 

I thought this result was a bit interesting. Mahlon M. Day in the paper [1] showed that the amenable groups are precisely the groups where there Markov-Kakutani theorem holds. If $(X,\mathcal{M})$ is an algebra of sets, then a function $\mu:\mathcal{M}\rightarrow[0,1]$ is said to be a finitely additive probability measure if $\mu(\emptyset)=0,\mu(X)=1$ and $\mu(A\cup B)=\mu(A)+\mu(B)$ whenever $A,B\in\mathcal{M}$ and $A\cap B=\emptyset$. If $G$ is a group, then a finitely additive probability measure $\mu:P(G)\rightarrow G$ on the algebra of sets $(G,P(G))$ is said to be left-invariant if $\mu(aR)=\mu(R)$ for each $R\subseteq G$. A group $G$ is said to be amenable if there exists a left-invariant finitely additive probability measure $\mu:P(G)\rightarrow[0,1]$. For example, every finite group is amenable, and every abelian group is amenable. Furthermore, the class of amenable groups is closed under taking quotients, subgroups, direct limits, and finite products. Let $C$ be a convex subset of a real vector space. Then a function $f:C\rightarrow C$ is said to be an affine map if $f(\lambda x+(1-\lambda)y)=\lambda f(x)+(1-\lambda)f(y)$ for each $\lambda\in[0,1]$ and $x,y\in C$. $\textbf{Theorem}$(Day) Let $G$ be a group. Then the following are equivalent.
