If they ask again, say it again. This can be surprisingly difficult, so practice. (Note that this applies to more situations than just the one you're in.) Now, if they ask a question that pertains to the business, such as: 

Give huge bonuses for cooperation that leads to good outcomes, and fire people who sabotage their coworkers. Huge bonuses. Like absolutely enormous. You know, like the bonuses that CEOs routinely grant themselves at the expense of the company. 

then you answer the question truthfully. Many companies have entirely reasonable policies that employees who have signed an offer letter with a competitor are security liabilities. (Whether you have to volunteer that information depends on your agreement with your current company; read your employee handbook.) It ought to go without saying but I'll say it anyway: Be prepared to be escorted out of the building by security at any moment after you announce your intention to resign. Make sure your personal items are already cleared out or nothing you wouldn't mind leaving behind. Another thing that ought to go without saying: if your current company asks you to sign anything other than your resignation letter or your final paycheque, do not sign it. Some companies will suddenly produce a noncompete agreement on the day that you're leaving that they "forgot" to ask you to sign on your first day. They are not in a position to get you to do anything; they can't legally withhold your pay, and threatening to fire you on your last day seems ineffectual. If they pressure you to sign anything, the right response is: 

It seems your manager and the company have allowed a double-standard in accountability and other things between most employees and this particular employee. You reap what you sow... and you are not the manager; your manager is. Your manager has this problem because s/he has chosen to apply a double standard --something a good manager wouldn't have done because it shows partiality/favoritism. As Snow said, there's not much you can do, and it's not your job to do it. There's not much to this. Your manager friend should hold everyone to the same standards, including general behavior, professionalism, level of accountability, and so on. 

I think other answers are very good, but I think what goes around comes around. Perhaps this person needs to receive a cup of his own medicine? Maybe you and/or your team members should feel offended at the fact that this person keeps feeling offended for trivial things and on someone else's behalf, and take the issue to HR? Who is he/she to feel offended when "Jeff", who is the target of the joke, didn't? That's just pretentious, to put it politely. On a more serious note, it's likely that HR is coming down on you hard because this easily-offended person is the only person making any noise (i.e. talking/complaining/reporting/etc). If you stay quiet and do nothing, you will pay the consequences later on because they may interpret that as you having "admitted" to being "offensive" by omission (e.g. not defending yourself). In fact, you don't even know what this person actually claimed behind your backs. This person is very unlikely to be trustworthy. (I've had to deal with difficult co-workers before, the "everyone's out to get them"-types, although it never got to HR in our team's case. Our team had tried to play "nicely", but they've been suffering the consequences of it for a long time now.) Instead, if you and/or the rest of your team report the situation to management and HR, then they may realize where the real problem actually is and, who knows, maybe even do something about it. To top it off, if/when HR comes down on this person, they might get everything they need out of this person's instant on-the-spot reaction. 

First: you said in previous questions that you've had health issues including difficulties with anxiety. I fully sympathize with how difficult that can be. I strongly encourage you to look for whatever kind of support system you have available to help mitigate those problems. Any problem gets a lot harder to solve when you have anxiety to deal with. There may be support available through your work, while you still have a job. Talk to your doctor. Use the resources at your disposal. Now, to consider your questions: 

Well, if I wanted that, I'd hire someone straight out of college. I want my industry hires to justify their higher cost by being immediately productive. 

One day shortly before I left MSFT they gave all of us personality tests, because middle management was obsessed with faddish metrics. Those personality tests showed that, SURPRISE, the people who were hired to build code analysis tools in a highly competitive environment were (1) analytical, and (2) competitive. Being competitive is great. People who enjoy competing should be hired for competitive industries! The trick is to incentivize competing with your competitors, not each other. A question you did not ask but seems germane: 

I would also like to point out that sometimes people have their workspaces set up in certain ways for accessibility reasons, especially when it comes to things like their chairs and their keyboards. So if you were to use those things without their permission, and especially if you adjusted them, you would be making things more difficult for your coworker upon their return. 

You say no, and you are mercifully cut off from a job that you can't live with. You say no, and the company offers to work with you on hours or wages to try and make the job more acceptable to you. (Or you specifically bring up the part-time/full-time issue as your response.) You say yes, thus committing yourself to a wage that you admit is unlivable. 

Because, as Chris G said, you asked for double their budget. They need to know that you'll be worth their time before they start the interview. If you don't want a poor wage hanging over your head for the entire interview, then it's on you to say something about it at the start of the interview, either to end it early or to resolve your concern. The moral of the story is that you should always have a plan for what to do if the company isn't willing to pay what you need to make. It sounds like you said "yes" because you were blindsided by the low wage. Hopefully that won't happen again. 

First off, if this subject interests you, I have a number of articles in my blog queue coming up in the next couple of weeks about how I deal with technical interview questions as an interviewer. To address your specific question: this is not a problem I ask, but suppose it were. Why would I do so? To find out: 

That was the correct response. An even better response would have been "I look forward to receiving your offer letter; please email it to blah@blah.com and I'll give it my prompt attention. Have a nice day, goodbye." 

Though this video is about a far more severe example of the issue you face, the conclusion reached by the presenter is applicable to your situation: $URL$ The relevant quote is: 

Don't pay for health care during that week. If you get injured, pay for it out of pocket. If the expense is catastrophic then you can sign up for COBRA retroactively up to sixty days after your last day and your coverage extends backwards in time to the day you left your job. It's expensive but it is cheaper than catastrophic care. Do not take my word for it; I am not an expert on COBRA. Today would be a great day to research COBRA and learn for yourself how the program works. You're fine. Go enjoy your vacation, and try to not break any limbs. 

Is it ethical/appropriate for the employer to do this? What steps can/should Alice take to better handle this situation? What is a good/tactful and effective way for Alice to communicate her concerns to her boss so that the chances of having her vacation/PTO restored to pre-disaster days are higher? 

How's that different from you asking your boss: "are you planning to lay me off or fire me?" or being asked about your religion during an interview? I've been in places where management constantly talks about how employees are their "greatest asset" only to lay them off in large numbers a short time later.. Alternatively, you could be up-front about the simple yes/no nature of the question: 

In my book, giving the "political" response (i.e. the so-called "white lie") is not a moral thing to do, even if it's (supposedly) considered "good practice" in the industry to do so. If you're tempted to lie about it... just refuse to answer. 

Presumably, any job searching has been done in your own time. Since when is it your boss' business what you do outside of work? How's that different from a boss asking a married person "are you planning to file for divorce?" What you do outside of work hours is none of your boss' business. I think you should decline to answer. 

Good start, but you have not yet explored all that is possible in the realm of closing down nosy questions. I do not want to discuss it with you. Full stop, end of conversation, do not feed the trolls. Talk about work at work. 

No one wants to be in that situation. Everyone is in that situation. So step two: Get used to it, and stop caring. The question that should be on your mind is not "do my undeserving no good slacker coworkers deserve their bonuses?" The question on your mind should be "am I getting an adequate compensation for the amount of work I'm putting in?" The answers to those two questions have nothing to do with each other. Put another way: the only way to control what bonuses your slacker coworkers get is to sabotage and badmouth them. Do you want to work at a company that encourages that kind of behaviour? Worry about what you're getting, not what anyone else is getting. Make yourself look good by enabling everyone around you to share in your success. 

So yes, it is possible that you would have been cut off from the job, but since you say you couldn't live with that job, this would actually be a better outcome, it sounds like. 

Yes, it is appropriate. Your recruiter does not expect you to drop all of your commitments at a moment's notice for a phone interview. Tell them you have a conflict that you can't get out of, and suggest some more appropriate times or dates as a jumping-off point for rescheduling. Any company worth working for will be understanding of this. 

You are playing an incredibly dangerous game here. If they refuse to give you a counter offer, then your options are either to quit and have no job, or to stay with the company anyway, in which case your credibility has been destroyed. If they find out, your boss will know that you are a liar and that is not something you want. Something similar happened to a friend of mine: they went to their boss with a real offer and asked for a counter-offer, which they did not get, and decided to stay in their current job. They basically lost their negotiating position with the company for the rest of their employment there. Management knew that their threats were toothless. As others have pointed out, they could even decide to end your employment right there and then. If you are unhappy enough with your current salary that you are willing to take action, then you should actually go out and get a better offer from another company. Do not make one up. You have far more to lose than you have to gain. 

The reason you have a team lead is because your boss has delegated that responsibility to your team lead. It's part of your team lead's job to communicate team progress to your boss. That said, always be ready if your boss asks you directly. You could show your boss that the tasks given to you are being completed in a reasonable amount of time (based on their inherent complexity and effort estimates), with good quality, and that you've been doing this consistently. I can totally relate to the "bragging" part and how it sucks. I think it depends on how you try to phrase things. To avoid that, just: 

Someone I know, let's call her "Alice", is on the receiving end of the following situation, and I'd like to become better informed before providing my opinion. This is in the US. Alice is an exempt employee in a consulting company. She works remotely from Puerto Rico, a US territory, for the company, which is based in the US mainland. Due to hurricane Maria back in September, Alice was left completely incommunicated for over a month, meaning she could not perform work during that time. The company continued to pay her salary during this time, which is required by law as far as I know. Currently, she's working from somewhere else in the US mainland, and has been doing so for over a month now, too. However, Alice's boss/manager met with her and told her that she has to update her time sheets to mark her vacation/PTO as having been "used up". To be honest, that seems inappropriate to me for a few reasons: 

You're not actually getting the benefits, are you? It sounds like you're just being shown the benefit information you'll have if you accept the job. It seems like HR is trying to sell you even more on the job before they make an official offer. This has happened to me before, as well. It doesn't seem particularly out of the ordinary. 

This should have been part of your response. "I can work with $X/2 if I can work Y hours per week" is still a good starting point for a discussion, probably even better than a simple "no". You should never feel like you're in the wrong for trying to ensure that you make a living wage. They clearly want to ensure that you're happy with the pay before they move forward, so I can't imagine the interviewer wouldn't want to discuss hours right then. 

I have a friend who currently works at Prestigious Company A, but he is in the process of interviewing for More Prestigious Company B. The interviews are going well, and now Company B wants him to come in for an in-person interview. The main problem is that Company B is in a totally different part of the country (USA) from Company A. Barring a weekend interview, which I don't think is too likely, the only option is to take vacation days to travel to Company B's location. Company A is probably going to ask why these vacation days are being taken, and my friend doesn't want to lie to them, but he also doesn't want them to know the real reason for the trip, lest there be consequences. How can my friend attend this in-person interview without tipping off his current employer? Barring that, how could he work out an interview time that wouldn't require the vacation days? 

There's a pre-scheduled conference company staff will attend (2 days from now), and Alice will be meeting her manager in person there as well; this topic will likely be brought up again in-person. 

[EDIT-1]: She does have a 'backup' plan to negotiate some things if it comes to that, but that's different to knowing whether this is or isn't something that's even permissible to do by employer and, if so, how employees could/should handle the situation. [EDIT-2]: She just got out of the meeting, and they did take away her vacation/PTO. I've updated the question on this basis. 

For a bit more detail, please read on. It Can Take Years to Earn Your Team's Respect You mention that you joined barely 1 month ago. That's barely time to get "settled" into your role, learn the names of your team members, and start getting into the flow of only the most basic things, relative to other tasks within the team, who's already more familiar with the software being worked on and all of the associated details. I'm assuming that, by getting "noticed", you mean acknowledged, recognized, respected, and/or treated as "reliable and competent" member of the team. In short, you need:
