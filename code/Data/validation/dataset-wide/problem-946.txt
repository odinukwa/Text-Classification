Just after sunrise or sunset, call a friend some number of time zones to the west and ask them where the sun is in their sky. Or, just before sunrise or sunset, call a friend some number of time zone to the east and ask them where the sun is in the sky. Then, think about why the sun is at different heights for you and for your friend. The more time zones this experiment crosses, the harder it will be to explain this as a feature of a flat earth. 

It looks man-made to me. Specifically, it looks like the outer rock was (perhaps naturally) smoothed before it was (not naturally) cut and then the inner rock added. Note the smooth outer rock. It looks water-worn, and its smoothness goes right up to that inner block (absent those cracks). But, at the same time, the inner block seems to protrude, protecting the nearby parts of the outer rock from abrasion (note the light-colored crust adjacent to the inner block). If that's true, then that part of the outer rock was smoothed before the inner block was added. I have no clue how this could have been done naturally. I also can't believe that such a small intrusion could be done naturally without splitting the original rock. That said, an oblique view of the apparent intrusion would be helpful. 

Yes, there is a correlation. In other words: places with hot springs are more likely to experience earthquakes than places without hot springs. The relationship is scale-dependent in time and space (your house might not sit on a hot spring but still get earthquakes). Ideally I'd dig around and find actual data to quantify this spatial correlation (and I hope someone does!), but for now I will settle for qualitative evidence at the continental scale. I offer a visual correlation between the two datasets in question. First, geothermal springs: 

It sounds to me like the reviewer is fixated on a 'rule' they encountered in grad school, but the rule ignores some real-world nuance (as rules do). Quick caveat: my answer isn't definitive, it's more of an opinion, but it was too long for a comment. It seems intuitively true that some phenomena just are smooth, so the resolution of the data is not the limiting factor in an analysis of resolution. I'm thinking of things like maps of average seasonal air temperature (say). Certainly, you can combine that with higher-resolution data and still claim to have a high-resolution analysis. Other data may not be implicitly smooth, but it's interesting to aggregate the data for the purposes of generalization.So the quality of academic institutions obviously varies on a per-institution basis (or per teacher, if you want to get silly about it), but it would be crazy to interpolate data like that and, since it's reasonable to think there might be national-level influence (e.g. in funding for education), it only makes sense to aggregate it that way. Again, I think it's reasonable to argue that you can combine data like this with higher-resolution data and have a high-resolution analysis overall. Still other data may simply be oversmoothed, or smoothed on the wrong basis. Temperature data by country, or geological data on a 100-km grid... Then I'd say those are limiting the resolution of any analysis you do. In conclusion... I can't think offhand of a way to formalize all this, and don't know of any research around it (though I'd bet on its existence). Assuming you don't want to go down the research rabbit hole, or have a protracted argument with the reviewer, my advice is to respond to the objection by using more specific language. Instead of generalizing, specify the resolutions of the various datasets involved and mention where it might be possible to improve the resolution. 

I get my weather forecasts from good ol' NOAA's weather.gov site. On the detailed site weather pages, there's a map that shows the forecast area as a green square (for Boston at least, the square is about 1.5 miles on a side). You can click on nearby areas to change the presented forecast to that new location. Here's the question: why is the square shown as the forecast area not oriented north/south/east/west? For some reason, near the US East Coast it's twisted clockwise, and on the West Coast it's twisted counter-clockwise. I assume it's something about the easy representation of weather information in a GIS system, but that's only a guess. Here are some examples, from East to West. First, Boston: 

I'm guessing that falling rain equilibrates fairly quickly to the temperature of the air it's falling through. However, it isn't always at the exact same temperature, which is why we can get the lovely phenomena called "freezing rain". How far below the ground-level air temperature can rain be? 

There's a story going around the low-grade news factories that one Dr. David Evans has predicted that the world will start cooling down in 2017. One source reports: 

Note that, if you go even further west to Hawaii, the pattern breaks, and the square is perfectly north/south/east/west: 

+1 for GPlates, but if you happen to be an ArcGIS user (I was once, but I'm better now), then the PaleoGIS plugin is pretty good. Skimming through their material I can't tell if there's any other way to run it, but I don't think there is. 

It's not a healthy distinction, but in petroleum geoscience one can characterize the distinction around the sort of data people look at. Geophysicists are into seismic, sonic logs, gravity and magnetics data, electromagnetic (resistivity) data,... and anything to do with computers. Geologists meanwhile are into core, outcrop, gamma-ray and density logs, stratigraphy, tectonic reconstructions,... and anything to do with coloured pencils. Of course, they're both working towards the same thing: a model of the earth and its history. Your question also made me think of a couple of Twitter conversations, both started by Chris Rowan at Kent State: 

It's the same story at an active margin: the plate boundary at a subduction zone is buried several kilometres beneath a wedge of sediment: 

No, you can't stop an earthquake with a nuclear weapon. You can't even start one. You asked if you could "obliterate a plate" with a nuclear explosion. Definitely not. Plates are between about 10 and 100 km thick, and as you can see from this map, the earth's 15 large plates are very large indeed: 

Earth travels along its orbit at about 30km/s. If you plug that number into a time dilation calculator, you'll find that one second on Earth passes every 1.0000000050069 seconds in a Sun-centric reference frame. Carbon-14 dating is good only to about 40,000 years into the past; Earth's time dilation would reduce that 40,000 years by a little under two hours, or far below the precision of the technique. Edit: I'd like to address three more issues. First, the rotation of the Earth's surface only results in about 0.5km/s at the equator, and so is insignificant compared to the orbital velocity. Second, nothing has changed the Earth's orbit for many millions of years, probably for billions of years, so that would also have no effect on the dating. Third, and more important, we're all traveling along on the Earth at (approximately) the same speed. So you, I, and a group of C-14 atoms in a fossil will all experience the same time dilation. 

Googling finds a number of other sites with the same story. Some identify Dr. Evans as a "former climate modeler for the Australian Greenhouse Office", others as an electrical engineer. None seem to provide any skepticism about Dr. Evans' statements. I'm sure this is a sham, as otherwise it would be an enormously important story that would be reported everywhere. If so, I'm a little surprised that I found no "boy is this stupid" responses. Perhaps the real climate experts are tired of playing "climate conspiracy Whack-A-Mole". If a climate change denier were to use this story as proof that anthropogenic global warming is a scam to keep earth scientists employed, what would be the best way to show that he is wrong? Edit: I just found that Dr. Evans serves on the Board of Advisors of the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow, an NGO that denies man-made global warming exists. 

It is cristobalite, the main alteration product of obsidian. Obsidian, a siliceous glass, is only metastable — all known obsidian is younger than the Cretaceous. Over time, it devitrifies, forming cristobalite, a polymorph of silica. So there's no change in chemistry, just in the arrangement of atoms in the mineral. It's not an overgrowth or a deposition. Quoting Jim Miller at Oregon State: 

The rock is a bit unusual. As Robinson (2013) noted, it's very poorly sorted, and might even qualify as diamictite. It must be very well cemented to be polished so smooth while maintaining its integrity. The clasts are very well-rounded and up to boulder-sized. Lastly, its provenance seems unknown. If you Google 'Marinace conglomerate', you'll see some similar rocks (often wrongly called 'granite' by the building stone industry). I suppose it's possible the rock was man-made somehow, but this seems pretty unlikely. Wherever the rock is from, I'm certain the boulder itself was polished, and probably shaped as well, by the sculptor. As mentioned in another answer, it's a piece of sculpture at University College London Hosptial entitled Monolith and Shadow (2005) by former UCL Slade Professor John Aiken. Like most public art, it was a bit controversial. Reference Robinson, E (2013). The history of Monolith and Shadow. Geology Today 29 (5), September–October 2013, p 168–169. DOI 10.1111/gto.12019. 

A page in the book Come Rain or Shine, A Weather Miscellany states that the cones were discontinued on June 1, 1984, due to their being superseded by radio broadcasts and other methods. 

Wind can be an incredibly localized phenomena, both in the short term and the long term. Although the broad outlines of a long-term wind forecast shouldn't be too complex or controversial, getting the details right will generally require actual on-site measurement. Google wind measurement sodar for some cool tools to do such measurement. 

The electricity you're talking about is the man-made kind, which is completely independent of any charge the Earth has relative to its atmosphere. Man-made power sources are almost all referenced to the Earth as zero volts, as established by connecting the "ground" to a conductive rod driven into the ground. Each house's electrical system is also grounded in this way. Since earth (lower-case "e") is at least somewhat conductive (except for perhaps dry sand), if you grab a conductor while standing barefoot on the ground then current will flow through you, through the ground, and then back to the source of electricity and/or your house's local grounding rod. Enough volts, and good enough conduction, and you get hurt or killed. Rubber shoes, rubber gloves, and just plain common sense can prevent this. Again, this has nothing to do with the charge the Earth has relative to its atmosphere, as man-made power is generated referenced to Earth ground; plus, since it's almost always alternating current, the polarity changes 50 to 60 times a second, so any purported existing voltage wouldn't protect you. 

Sound-like waves are routinely used to image the subsurface, but mostly well below the ultra-sound band. Several methods involve sound-like vibrations: 

It depends on the implementation, but bare-bones reverse time migration is usually not amplitude friendly. The problem is that the ideal imaging condition — deconvolution — is difficult to apply or unstable in the time domain. So cross-correlation is used instead, and this loses the relative amplitude information... so amplitudes are no longer necessarily related to reflection coefficients. Since this is the assumption of inversion (e.g. AVO inversion), an RTM volume could give spurious results. Several vendors have devised ways to compensate for this. For example, Zhang & Sun (2009; First Break, vol 26) described one of CGG's methods. Zhang et al. have written more recently (2013; EAGE London) about how this processing has evolved. Cogan et al (2011; SEG Annual Meeting) have written about Schlumberger's normalization algorithms, which aim to achieve the same goal. Those papers also contain nice explanations of why RTM is not ordinarily amplitude friendly. My advice is to talk at length to your vendor about the processing applied, and the attention paid to phase and amplitude. Ask lots of questions. Most processors (generalizing horribly) are either over-enthusiatic about treatments, especially new and/or proprietary ones, or ignorant of your needs as an interpreter–analyst. So if you're actually in the middle of processing now, test everything, ideally against geological data (like a synthetic). Lots of processing steps can hurt amplitudes, and inversion can work in surprisingly poor data... so assume nothing, and never give up!
