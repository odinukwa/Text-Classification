"How is bicycle infrastructure designed and how does it evolve?"? Well, as the other answerers have suggested, the answer is "that depends." When I worked for the Bureau of Land Management, here in the U.S., I did recreation management for a broad scattering of federal public lands. Some of these lands were adjacent to cities. In the cases where we built bicycle infrastrucutre, it was mostly in reaction to noisy demand. Since dispersed recreation is more difficult for agencies to quantify and measure than straight-up vehicle traffic, accident rates, levels of congestion, or visitation at a specific site, there is a bit of guesswork involved. Ideally, agencies ask for public involvement--in the form of town meetings, or public planning meetings and open houses--and respond to public input. If the people ask for bicycle infrastructure, we give it to them. Or, if agencies managing lands adjacent to ours build bicycle infrastructure, we may build similar infrastructure to create connectivity (in the instance of "money from heaven", the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act, for instance). My point here is this. Those who demanded bicycle infrastructure in the areas around Coloma, California, may not have been the majority of residents or even the majority of attendees at our open-houses. Those who demanded bicycle infrastructure, though, CONSISTENTLY attended the meetings and CONSISTENTLY voiced their opinions--both loudly and coherently. They came to the meetings with a vision and the broad outlines of a plan. They left the last meeting with a committment from my agency to flesh out the plan and build the bike paths. We did not build bike trails as a whim or just to use up some money. We built them to satisfy a small but vocal constituency that responded effectively to all of its detractors. 

A trailer with a 100# capacity fully loaded over the axle is unlikely to cause significant damage to your bicycle frame--even using the attachment device shown for the Rhode Gear trailer, above. The "tongue weight" of such a trailer would probably be in the twenty-to-thirty pound range. Just don't load this trailer--or any trailer--with all of the weight forward of the axle. Minimize your tongue weight. Remember we're talking about tubular steel on your bike which is some pretty strong stuff. I wouldn't hang an automobile trailer on it or anything, but it can handle this little trailer. Also. How many times can you load a Rhode Gear trailer up with 100# and still have a trailer? I think the trailer is the weak link in this equation. Most often, you will use this trailer with maybe 40-50# max, right? Even pulling it every day--not likely to cause much problem. If you start a bicycle-based concrete business, go back to the commuter bike. I ride a Sakae Ringyo Litage. Thin aluminum tubing--road racing geometry--from the early 90's. I pull a trailer with it from time to time--sometimes a Burley flatbed with a lawnmower onboard. (Ususally, if I'm smart, I pull it with my Schwinn Tempo). Someday that aluminum frame is going to break on me. It isn't going to be the trailer's fault--it's going to be the 200# rider that causes it to break! Your steel frame is going to be fine pulling that trailer for the trailer's entire natural life. Ride on! 

In the worst possible scenario, you would brake hard while signalling and have your other arm with its elbow locked. Doing that, all of the g-forces are transmitted through your arm to your torso which may then feel like it's going to pivot over the handlbars. No one likes that sensation. Use more of your body to absorb that force and position yourself to account for it beforehand. 

When winter arrives and brings shorter days, I add additional lights. As you say, this is just more urban lights, but a bike light--especially if it is blinking--does make you more visible. I prefer a light with an erratic blink pattern, such as Planet Bike's BLAZE with superflash mode ($URL$ This erratic pattern forces you to the forefront of attention. Lights and reflectors are essential but are not the whole answer. I ride at night to be right where the motorists can see me. It is always important to do this, but more so at night. When there is no bike lane and no wide shoulder, I take the MIDDLE of the lane. This is particularly important in an urban setting like Oakland or Sacramento, CA--where I ride. Traffic in the city is heavy and often not much faster than I am. Often cars are maxxing out at 25mph whereas I'm riding at around 15-18mph. I can ride in the middle of the lane and if they're anxious, they can pass me. The downside of this is that I hear a few drivers sounding their horns in protest. The upside is that no one is surprised by me. No driver wants to damage their $20,000+ automobile by hitting a cyclist. I'm a big guy, too--I'd damage their car. So I ride right where they see me. Most places where I ride are urban city streets--usually with two lanes in each direction, sometimes a left-turn lane. I use all of these just as a motorist would--and California state law supports me in doing this. My goal and the goal of the law here are to be visible and predictable. I ride like I belong there--without trying to be a jerk about it. The motorists have a passing lane to get around me--and if they don't, I let them pass whenever it's safe and with easily-recognizable hand signals. If they're right behind you, after all, you have their attention. Be both visible AND predictable. Have good situational awareness--know what's going on all around--and react to motorists who may not be doing the same. Have a safe ride! 

My bike and I are fairly visible at night--white light in front, red light in the back, bright yellow fenders, reflective tabs and a light on my helmet. I use hand signals to alert motorists when I'm turning... but I don't think they can see my hands in the dark. Is there anything different I should do when I'm signalling a turn in an unlit place? 

I commute by bicycle in the summer in Sacramento, CA... there are days when it is so hot in the afternoon that I avoid brushing against the steel frame of my bike because it burns the skin to touch! I agree that open-toed sandals are not such a great idea for cycling--even when overheating is an issue--but I also believe that heat stress is a real problem that must be dealt with. Cooling my feet off isn't my highest priority, but it is certainly in the mix. The solution that I have found are close-toed sandals. In fact, I have found a pair of closed-toed sandals that accept cleats for clipless pedals. I roll with SPD's in my sandals in the summer. I'm riding in Keen Commuter sandals in the summer: $URL$ My one issue with them is that I need to cinch them very tight in order to not feel them moving on my foot when I'm lifting up on the pedal. Otherwise, no complaints! 

So far most of what have been suggested are handtools... some planning and design tools are important as well. Get a copy of the International Mountain Biking Association's book, "Trail Solutions: IMBA's Guide to Building Sweet Singletrack." Find it here: $URL$ I spent the last three winters designing and building an 8-mile-long mountain bike trail with a specialist from IMBA--and this book is a really great resource. The tools that I used the most while doing trail layout were a CLINOMETER and ROLLS AND ROLLS OF FLAGGING. Ideally, to minimize erosion, you will want to keep your trail grades under 12% with short, steep pitches minimized. Even after spending months in the woods with a clino, I still sometimes look at a grade and guess it wrong--usually too steep. Always double-check with the clino. When we were laying out the Paradise Royale trail, at King Range National Conservation Area, we used several colors of flagging--one to denote the downhill side of the trail-to-be, one to denote access points or GPS waypoints, and another to denote specific trees that needed to be removed, etc. I think we went through at least five cases of flagging while laying out that trail. In the King Range, one could not utilize flagging without creating sight-lines... so we often used small saws and lopping shears for that. Get the sight-lines open so that you can actually use the clino. Get some good-quality topo maps of the area where you are building as well as a GPS with topo map background display. These made finding our way between cliff faces, water features and old logging roads possible despite dense foliage. During our sessions crashing through the forest, we found two-way-radios to be quite valuable. These were especially important during the scouting phase. "What's it look like where you are right now?" "It's a tangle of brush and rocks." "Looks like that here, too--what's your side-slope?" "Like 80%" "Okay, lets meet back at the creek crossing and rethink this..." It all depends on how intense the terrain and foliage are where you will be working... but you get the picture. 

Is it feasible? Yes. Yes it is. As has already been said, many people rebuild old frames like this with newer parts to create unique rides. I don't know much about xUSSR bicycles, but I would guess that a lot of the parts are copies or near-copies of popular nonUSSR components. To my eye, this looks like a knock-off of an early-80's Japanese road bike. Maybe it is. You'll find out when you start taking it apart and learning what the thread pitch is on the bottom bracket, etc. Is it silly? Also yes. But does that matter? I do a lot of things because they are silly. Rebuilding this bike can cost as much or as little as you like. Chances are, you will "loose" money on it. Did you pay anything for it to start with? If you are considering doing this, is working on bikes a form of amusement for you? (It is for me). I would consider the cost of rebuilding this bike minus the value of the finished product to be the actual cost of a fine piece of entertainment. And really, if you put some decent components on this bike (and it fits you), you might have a pretty sweet ride with a low >>BLING<< value. Nobody's going to pick this bike to steal from a rack of thirty bicycles. Just lock up next to the 2011 Cervelo--nobody's going to steal your bike, even if it's all Ultegra. 

I am posting this as a separate answer because it is so different from my commentary on planning and design... We don't like to think of people as tools. Usually only law enforcement types think of regulations as tools... but think of both of these as well. I have worked for four different land management agencies in the U.S. and have built or maintained hundreds of miles of trails. User-defined trails on public lands are often a headache--and although we often do not catch the trail-builder, the trails are often quickly dismantled. Know who the important players are. Is it a U.S. Forest Service forestry technician at the local office? Is it the director of parks and recreation for a county park? Know who these people are and start talking with them early. Even if they have no plans to build a mountain bike trail where you want one... if it is on their land, you will need to work with them. In my experience, I have had groups approach me with interest in a trail where we had no interest in building one. Sometimes it works out. If there are no other issues--endangered species, riparian habitat, watershed issues, ownership patterns, etc--sometimes these trails get built. It can take some time to get buy-in... but if there is community support it usually only takes a little tenacity and negotiation to get into trail-building mode. Often on public lands, the trail will get built as an "agency project" with you providing all of the "volunteer" labor... but it does happen. Also, be prepared to at some point realize that sometimes "no" is the answer. If you have a great spot that you want to build a trail across public land but you come to learn that it is the only hillside in the world where the limestone salamander lives... is the extirpation of a species something we should risk for a recreation trail? True, sometimes minor environmental concerns are used by agencies as stalling techniques... but get to know the players and soon you will learn which issues are important and which can be "mitigated." Know the players and know the rules. Understand that if you are planning to build a mountain bike trail through a designated wilderness area in the U.S. that the answer will always be "no" and that it is out of the hands of local officials. "Wilderness" with a capital "W" is enacted by the U.S. Congress and cannot be changed through negotiaion with anyone save congressional aides. Bicycle travel is not permitted in wilderness areas by congressional decree (1963). There are, of course, a lot of players and a lot of rules. I have just given a few examples here... but knowledge of your LOCAL issues, players, and regulations, may be the most important TOOLS IN YOUR TOOLCHEST. 

When I was living in the North Country and it was cold... like below zero for most of January... I switched to puncture-resistant tubes. I mean, I wasn't going for long rides. I wasn't riding because it was a lot of fun--it was transportation and I was on a beater-mountain-bike with big knobbys, anyway. The extra weight wasn't that big a deal. The thick rubber tubes are heavy, but they keep your rims off of the pavement and you have to hit something serious to get a puncture. In the spring, I took those damned things out of my tires and put lightweight tubes back in. Nice thing about the heavy-rubber tubes is that they last for several winters. For running back and forth to the grocery store, it worked fine. So. Answer to your question... at -22F. Avoid changing a tube. 

You might consider tapping this thread back out if you have a decent tap-and-die set. Otherwise, a heli-coil should work for this application. I would be more concerned with a heli-coil if you were using it on a post-bolt that would experience tensile stress--that is, "pull-out" force. This bolt will be under mostly shear-stress, which means that the majority of the strength will be derived from the body of the post rather than from the threads. I'm not an engineer--engineers, please correct me--but this is what my thinking is when I fix a broken piece of metal in a situation like yours. If you are a little paranoid, you might goop the bolt threads with some JB Weld before threading them into the heli-coil. This will add a little tensile strength and piece of mind, but should be pretty easy to break out with a breaker-bar if and when you choose to remove the part. Note also that, in my experience, any use of a heli-coil or JB weld has the potential to be an "ultimate" fix. That is, once it's fixed... it's fixed for all practical purposes and subject to failure if "fixed" again in the same place. I might do this to my 90's Rockhopper, but I don't suggest it for your 2011 Santa Cruz Blur that you plan to change everything out on next season. Short answer: With the sort of riding you are suggesting, I would do the fix you are suggesting on my beater mountain bike. On my high-end down-hill ride... I would take it to a frame builder and have the post replaced. 

The Rema Tip-Top patches that I use--which sound similar to those which the questioner describes--come with instructions in each plastic box. The package that I have shows the instructions pictorally in seven steps. Here is the product that I use: $URL$ In step 7, the manufacturer distinctly recommends that the user remove the plastic backing. I usually remove this cellophane backing myself. It sometimes is a little finnicky--if your patch isn't totally set it will seem to pull up the patch. Just use your thumb to set the patch more carefully. In the package's Step 6, the manufacturer uses a totally unidentifiable rectagular object to smooth out the patch before removing the cellophane. I use my thumb, personally, and it works just fine. If one side of the cellophane won't seem to come off without removing the patch, you didn't put down enough vulcanizing fluid. Try the other side. If the patch is reasonably centered, this shouldn't be a problem. The answer about leaching chemicals is news to me--though I admit freely that I never looked farther than the instructions in the box for advice. Once in a moment of frustration, I left the cellophane on and put it into the tire--no problems so far. I had some concern there would be a problem if the cellophane were stuck between the rim and the bead but this doesn't seem to have been a problem for Anthony K or Darren Cope. It looks as though it doesn't matter, but the manufacturer of Rema patches recommends removing it. I say remove it carefully. This is best done if you are generous with the vulcanizing fluid and careful to press the patch into place.
