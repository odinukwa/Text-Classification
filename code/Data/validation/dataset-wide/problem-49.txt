I think this solution is interesting, because it uses the same setting as the earth, no gravity change, no alien breathing heavy gases... 

Marchetti described the relation that exists between the two: 1 hour commute is the compromise. If you enhance the transportation speed, people are still going to live at 30 minutes from a place where things (work/museums/bars/shops/…) happens . So if you create a very efficient transportation system, it’s very likely that people are going to live even further to the place of work and keep commute 30 minutes. Teleportation If you go to the extreme and invent tele-transportation, or generalize remote office, people are not going to group into cities. I would go to a mountain, in an isolated woodhouse, and jump in my tele-transportation machine every time I want to go to work or to see my friends. The territory will look like many isolated houses, small villages, isolated companies’ buildings (I have a cool company, our offices are at the north pole!). Maybe a pub street in the middle of nowhere, to go pub crawling without having to take the teleport machine between bars. Your case Now, your case. Even if, seen from space, your country looks like a big city, it will have many sub-systems, many “downtown” areas. These centres areas are going to be, according to Marchetti’s law, about 1hour commute time from each other (well, ok, this assumes that transportation speed is the same between centres than between suburb to centre, which is not true. It’s usually faster to go from one centre to the other than from the centre to the suburb, but let’s assume it). So transportation is not as primordial as city planning. You can, if you want, keep the current transportation hardware and make a city of any size work fine, as long as it is well planned for this kind of transportation. 

I guess it is less spectacular than removing wise teeth, but waaay more useful. Last idea: remove addictions from humans. They will live longer and better. Tobacco, alcool, games, sugar, money, … Let them enjoy it, but don’t make them need it. 

Wind going upward Well, this is probably the difficult part. You need to admit for the phenomena to be localized, i.e. not the whole world will be like that, only a region. Let's admit there are two regions separated by a very high mountain range. Below the mountains are a network of caves, but instead of having one big entry/exit hole, they have trillions of very very small ones. Your people are living just on top of them. When the atmospheric pressure is different between the two regions, wind is forced through the caves. It will appear to come out of the ground (or be sucked in on the other side). There are some rocks that are porous, so it's not impossible to build a city on top of something that let the air go through. I am very good at drawing, so I decided to impress you and did an illustration of my idea: 

You could explain that by the need for the victim to recognize its master (maybe by the smell?). It would add a difficulty for the offender, as his dna would be available in the victim organism for a while. Also it adds a limitation of only one person able to give orders to the intoxicated victim. 

Proposition A better way to explain it, would be the aliens wanting to protect the human race. They think that we are likely to destroy ourselves, either by war or by destroying the planet’s environment. So they decided to build a backup for us. If the human race disappears from earth, it would still exist on another planet. They are just very philanthropic. 

Classic war In an open war between well-defined opponents, larger boats, even if they can't catch your catamarans, can come in range of cities and gun them from the sea. They could occupy harbours. They can go further in the open sea. They can carry more men and resources, in a safer way. My guess is that the catamarans are going to lose, not because they are sunk, but because the large ships are going to cut their harbours, resources and so on. Hull design solution You ask if anything can be done in terms of hull design. I believe that the only way is making it bigger. But probably, while trying to make them bigger, they are going to lose some of the advantages (think weight and structure fragilization). Maybe the architects are going to reinvent mono-hulls? Adaptative solution : Guerilla war So, as these boats won’t stand in front a large mono-hull vessel. Their strategy, in order to exploit their advantage at the maximum, is to play it guerrilla style. 

Bees are cheap Actually bees are nearly free. (Also, some bees, but not always the ones used for industrial crop pollination, make a product you can sell as a honey bonus.) So yes, currently people are trying to make robots that do bees’ work, but I believe it is only for show. Who seriously wants to pay to develop, construct and maintain thousands of robots while the bees are doing it for free? Flying robots are expensive, but bee-robots are so even more because: 

Yes: the trap is going to kill you because you shut the light. Sidenote 2 A flashlight might save you. But maybe you did not pack one. Or the designer of the trap constructed a short underwater passage before the trap to make sure no fire torch (nor any electric non waterproof flashlight) made it to it. 

Rescue I would create a rescue company. Advertise worldwide that you can rescue anyone, or anything, from anywhere. A few example: 

Weight is “easy” to determine, if you have or can build a scale. But the volume is difficult to determine. Usually it is done by putting the object in a fluid and seeing how much fluid is displaced. So, if you are able to build a big bathtub to find the dragon volume, you could as well build a boat to cross the lake. 

A mountain! Put a big mountain close to your city. Or, better said a volcano, because an isolated mountain would be too strange. A volcano can be pretty isolated, think for instance of the Kilmanjaro. So you have the desert, and in the middle of it, the big mountain (maybe 4000m above the desert level). The city lies at the foot of the mountain. This might solve some of the problems your citizens are facing: 

The sunlight radiation is very important for the climate, so I understand the answer that is saying "no change, because the sun goes through". However, I don't believe this is quite right. Your alien will need energy. No way out of this. They have computer/fridges/whatever, so they need to power it. If they don't get it from the sun, they need to get it from the planet. Let's consider a few options: Sun Ok, you said they won't. But the easiest way for them would be to take some solar energy. Even if they plant trees to feed themselves, trees are actually taking sun energy. And they are shading the earth below. If the sun goes 100% through their city, it means they are 100% transparent (the city and themselves). Highly unlikely. If you can see them or their cities, they are blocking some solar radiation. If they have vegetables, trees or solar panels, they are already using solar energy. Wind Ok, let's assume they didn't touch the sunlight. Everything is transparent in their cities. The sun goes 100% to the ground. So the first and most obvious energy source would be the wind. However, slowing the wind is not without effect. (Yes, if you take energy from it, you are slowing it). See for instance this article. Actually, even if they don't take energy from it, it is likely that their cities in the sky are going to affect the wind. Basically you can count on poorer energy redistribution. Warm places are going to get warmer. Cold places colder. Water They could condensate the water up there, directly from the cloud, and use it as it used in dams. So let it drop through their pillars and put a turbine at the bottom of it. The effect would be to reduce the amount of rain on much of the planet. All the water would go down through pillars, no through rain. Everywhere would turn into a desert. Only exception would be the deserts, as you said the pillars are in there. So the area around pillar basis would get too much water, the rest would be dry. Also consider the effet of releasing a lot of non-salty water in oceans. Likely to change ocean currents, like stopping the gulf stream. Anything else For instance stealing petrol or uranium from us. Will likely result in pollution and wars. Catastrophic for the climate. Just as we know it these days, just worse.
