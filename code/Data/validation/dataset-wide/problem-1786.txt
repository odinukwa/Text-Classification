Get rid of it. Thats is not an openvpn parameter. UPDATE Yes, I see you needed to add the client parameter as well. I am in the habit of setting up OpenVPN between networks with static keys and IP addresses. I never need the client parameter in those cases. 

The client would therefore receive the 404 in the SIP reply plus it will be told to connect to sip:not-in-service-recording@atlanta.com for a recorded message. 

You should edit your expect script to allow for timeout and expected result after rsync. For example: 

So what you need to do is add mydomain.com as a permited host in the users table, mysql database. For example: 

Nice summary, HopelessN00b! I’d like to add the following, regarding the operation of two 2012 Essentials in parallel (which I wish I had known before I purchased two of them): First: As you already mentioned, Essentials needs to be a Domain Controller, i.e. it must have the DC role installed and properly configured, otherwise it shuts itself down every 7 days. (If it’s installed but not configured properly it shuts down every 31 days.) Second: There can be only one Essentials on your (discoverable) network. If you run another one on the same network they’ll find each other (via NetBIOS?) and one of them shuts down. You can, however, run an Essentials side by side with an Windows Server Standard (2008/2012 doesn’t matter) without problems and even connect their Domain Controllers, as long as the Essentials has the primary DC role. BTW: In my tests, it turned out you actually can connect two Essentials’ DC roles to one Standard DC without them shutting down each other, but as only one of them can have the primary DC role, the other one will shutdown itself within 31 days (as it’s not properly configured regarding the license requirements). Of course, if you’d dig yourself through the whole Essentials licensing documentation, you’d find those information, but if you’re like me think »I don’t need all those Standard features, I just want a small server for XY« this could easily get you in the same trouble as I got. Hope this saves someone some days (and money, as there is no upgrade pricing from Essentials to Standard.) 

As you can see a tcpdump capture on port 69 will not show you the full dialog. Also if you have NAT, once the server attemps to send a file from a source port other than 69, most NAT implementations will fail to forward the packet (only a full cone or restricted cone NAT will work, but Port Restricted or Symmetric NAT will not). 

You can also add just '%' and it would work for any host, its like a wildcard. If you can't even get into the database to make the above changes, then you should change your hostname to localhost from mydomain.com. Your allowed connections to the database should at the very least be the localhost ip 127.0.0.1 UPDATE: 

Double check if you are installing SQL Server on a server in the same domain of the SBS. Even if you think it was, it may have lost trust - so try rejoining the computer to the same domain. 

I’m wondering if the conditions of automatic failover are not being met at the time of your tests? Specifically - if the database is not synchronized with the mirror (check mirroring state from sys.database_mirroring) at the time of failure AND/OR if the witness and mirror are not connected at that time (test via pings between participating roles). You could also have a situation where your Partner and Mirror are not connected to each other - but the partner and mirror databases are still connected to the witness independently. In that case the witness sees nothing wrong (and hence no failover). But you mentioned you shut down the server itself, so this sounds less likely. Or are you saying that the failover eventually happens but your re-connection fails? In this case, detection and failover time vary depending on how the principal failed and total time to recover the mirror db. 

the important thing to note here is that it is lightning fast! That is because huge number of ip networks can be represented by a single hash instead of hundreds or thousands of lines of iptables rules. For blocking countries see this example: 

I think you can see the point. If you are not familiar with military timezones here is the list: $URL$ You can also try to use zdump to see if your zone file is not really what you are expecting: 

If you do not even see the outgoing packet, then there is an internal problem with the name resolution config on your server. 

This question may be a bit old, but I just ran across this as I’m currently setting up some similar thing (syncing one VM across multiple hosts via Dropbox) and discovered that my approach is not mentioned here: 

I don’t know ESX, but on ESXi you can edit its network settings with connected KVM by pressing F2. Or on older ESXi you could press Alt+F1 to enter the local console as described here. 

This way the big part of the VM needs to be copied only once to every host and the differencing part will be synced via Dropbox. You just need to place the parent disk file(s) intelligently, as the differencing disk in the Dropbox links to the parent disk on the hose, so the parent disk has to have the (symlinked) same path on all hosts. As I mentioned, I’m currently just setting this up and haven’t solved the problem that each differencing disk split file gets up to 2GB and thus the syncing would again perform really bad. I think is able to adjust the size of the a split disk, but I can’t confirm this at the moment and also don’t know how the VM performs with small split disk parts. (I’ll update this, when I get to know more.) 

As you can see the first parameter ($1) is the device interface, for example it could be the wifi interface. It also resets interface ifb0 which is an alternative to tc filters for handling ingress traffic, by redirecting it to a virtual (ifb0) interface and treat is as egress traffic there. The idea is that you can shape egress traffic but not ingress traffic, thereby if you can make all traffic egress then you can shape it. This line creates a scheduler (qdisc) for the traffic on the interface supplied in paramter $1: 

The first thing I would do before proceeding further would be to test port 25 end to end with a tool like netcat. The tool comes standard with most linux distros. For example on CentOS I would stop postfix to release port 25. Then I would start netcat like this: 

I’m assuming based on your listing that your alerts are firing when you select all databases, but not firing when selecting specific database. The flow of the database monitoring SQL Agent job is as follows: 

per your first question, replication of system databases isn't supported. Regarding your core issue: Have you traced events that would tell you definitively that this is not being enabled by end-users? If this happens periodically, you may want to audit/trace for related events to make sure that this is indeed the case. The most common reason behind this is that indeed someone has enabled this functionality at some point (sometimes as innocent as just experimenting with the Replication wizard in SSMS). With that said - there was a rare case I saw where running DBCC CHECKDB \ DBCC CHECKTABLE with data loss marked the database for replication during the fix (even though it wasn't a publication). Rare situation, so I think you should validate the more common one first (unless you've been doing a DBCC CHECKDB\CHECKTABLE with data loss recently). 

You could either have a firewall rule blocking access or Your /copos directory does not have full permissions. You should be able to figure it out by doing a: 

The reason your are getting the mydomain.com error is because the operating system is resolving the DNS host name lookup 127.0.0.1 to mydomain.com. That is not a mysql issue but a networking issue. 

while you attempt to download a file. If you don't get any entries then its a firewall issue, if you get something like: 

As you can see it is a "mostly free format human readable date", it will pick up the timezone from anywhere it sees fit. It is very easy to test it. For example:
