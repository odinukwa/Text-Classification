Let $F$ be a number field. The classical class field theory gives an isomorphism between the ideal class group $Cl(F)$ and $\mathrm{Gal}(H/F)$, where $H$ is the Hilbert class field (maximal unramified abelian extension) of $F$. Recall that $Cl(F)$ is the torsion part of $K_0(\mathcal{O}_F)$. Quillen and Borel determined the abelian group structure of higher K-groups of $\mathcal{O}_F$. We also knot that they are finitely generated and its size of torsion part is connected with zeta-values like ideal class groups. My question: do we have a ''class field theory'' describing the (torsion part) of higher K-groups of $\mathcal{O}_F$ by some ''higher Hilbert class field''? 

Edit:Let $K=\mathbb Q(\zeta_p)^+$ Since it's easy to show $-1 \in N(\mathcal O_K ^{\times})$ and $\mathrm{Gal}(K/k)$ is cyclic, your question is equivalent to ask whether $\mathrm{H}^2(K/k,\mathcal O_K^\times)=0$. By a fact about Herbrand quotient ([1]Proposition1.2.4) , this is equivalent to ask whether $|\mathrm{H}^1(K/k,\mathcal O_K^\times)|=n$, where $n=[K:k]$. Apply the exact sequence([1]Proposition1.2.3) to our case $K/k$. Since $K/k$ is totally ramified, and the raimified primes are principal. We have the following exact sequence $$0\longrightarrow \mathrm{Ker}(J) \longrightarrow \mathrm{H}^1(K/k,\mathcal O_K^\times) \longrightarrow \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}\longrightarrow 0,$$ where $J$ is the natural map from $Cl(k)$ to $Cl(K)$. Then we know $|\mathrm{H}^2(K/k,\mathcal O_K^\times)|=|\mathrm{Ker}(J)|$. So your question is to ask whether there is a nonprincipal ideal of $k$ becomes principal in $K$. If $h_k$ is coprime to $n$, then $J$ is injective, so the norm of units is surjective as Pound Sterling said. If $h_k$ is not coprime to $n$, $J$ may be injective or not. For example, $p=229$,$|\mathrm{Ker}J|=3$, as Pound Sterling says the norm index is $3$. $p=2089,h_k=3$, and $\mathrm{gcd}(h_k,n)=3$, but $J$ is injective, see[2,Page 2728], so the norm map between units is surjective. Numerically, most $p$ such that $\mathrm{gcd}(h_k,n)>1$ adimt a nontrival $\mathrm{Ker} J$, hence the norm map between units is not surjective. See the discussion in [2]Page 2727.

All of these observations are straightforward to prove (I will give details if necessary). It might help to know that the center of $A$ is $Z(A)=k[x^p,y^p]$ and that $ad_q$ is a derivation (i.e., it satisfies the Leibniz Rule). Also, if I'm not mistaken, the following formula is valid: $ad_q(h)^{n}=\sum_{k=0}^{n} (-1)^k {n \choose k} q^k h q^{n-k}$ $\forall h \in A$. Hence, if $q$ is good, there exists a $p^j$ such that $0=ad_q(h)^{p^j}=hq^{p^j}-q^{p^j}h=[h,q^{p^j}]$, so $q^{p^j} \in Z(A) = k[x^p,y^p] $. I would be satisfied if someone had any hint or idea on how to attack this problem. Thank you! PS: I don't usually post on MO, so I apologize if I made any mistakes or if this question is not appropriate for this website. 

I'm studying the classic results on binary (integer) quadratic forms and I'm looking for a reference on the following result (maybe a book that contains a proof): Let $O_k$ be the ring of algebraic integers of $Q(\sqrt{d})$. In the set of ideals of $O_k$, we define the equivalence relation $I \sim J \Leftrightarrow \exists a,b : (a)I=(b)J$ where $(a)$ is the ideal generated by $a$. Then, the equivalence classes of $\sim$ form a group $G$ with the usual multiplication of ideals. Furthermore, $|G|=h(d)$, where $h(d)$ is the class number. The definition I've read for $h(d)$ is the number of equivalence classes of quadratic forms with discriminant $d$ for the equivalence relation $f \sim g \Leftrightarrow f(x,y)=g(px+qy,rx+sy)$ with $ps-qr=1$. If someone could give me a good reference in this nice connection I would be really grateful. 

The numbers n such that every group of order n is cyclic, abelian, nilpotent, supersolvable, or solvable are known. Most are described in an easy to read survey: Pakianathan, Jonathan; Shankar, Krishnan. "Nilpotent numbers." Amer. Math. Monthly 107 (2000), no. 7, 631-634. MR 1786236 DOI: 10.2307/2589118 If you want to go beyond results like this, you may have better luck looking at a slightly more refined version of the order: the isomorphism type of the Sylow subgroups. Sometimes a p-group P has the property that every group G containing it as a Sylow p-subgroup has a normal subgroup Q of order coprime to p such that G is the semi-direct product of P and Q. An easy version of this that does appear in many group theory texts is that if n=4k+2, then in each group G of order n there is a normal subgroup Q of order 2k+1 so that G is the semi-direct product of any of its Sylow 2-subgroups and Q. Groups all of whose Sylow p-subgroups are cyclic have very nice properties, subsuming those of groups of square-free order. Groups all of whose Sylows are abelian have more flexibility, but are still basically under control. 

For a research project I'm currently working on, I came across the following problem: Let $A=$ $^{k <x,y> }\Big/_{(yx-xy-1)}$ be the Weyl Algebra over a field $k$ of characteristic $p$, where $p$ is an odd prime. For an element $q(x,y) \in A$, define the operator $ad_q(h):=[q,h]=qh-hq$. My question is: 

This question arose from a problem in Niven & Zuckerman's book "Introduction to the Theory of Numbers". In the chapter that the authors introduce the mobius function, the first exercise is the following: Find a positive integer $n$ such that $\mu(n)+\mu(n+1)+\mu(n+2)=3$, i.e, $\mu(n)=\mu(n+1)=\mu(n+2)=1$. A brute-force aproach reveals the solution $n=33$. My question is simply: Are there infinitely many $n$ in the previous conditions? I really don't know how to aproach this problem. I tried various things (factorials, chinese remainder theorem, etc.) and i didn't come up with nothing. Also, for the first thousand numbers, there are the solutions $n=33,85,93,141,201,213,217,301,393,445,633,697,869,921$. One can also think in the variation of the problem with $\mu(n)=\mu(n+1)=\mu(n+2)=-1$ or simply $\mu(n)=\mu(n+1)=1$. Thanks in advance! 

E = SmallGroup(32,28) is the first example. It has two central subgroups A1 and A2 isomorphic to A ≅ 2 with quotient isomorphic to SmallGroup(16,11), but A1 and A2 are not conjugate in Aut(E). Examples such as this are reasonably common in p-groups. Edit: You can even have such an example with G abelian: G = 4×2, A = 4×2, E = SmallGroup(64,3) = 8⋉8, Z(E) = 4×4. E has two central copies of A=4×2 that are not conjugate in Aut(G), but the quotients are both abelian and isomorphic to G. Edit: Vipul notes you can even have E abelian of order p7. 

I've enjoyed Peter Cameron's exposition of permutation groups; most have a very CS feel and are almost exclusively devoted to solving some sort of combinatorial problem (often of real use). He has recently written some lecture notes on a problem in synchronization(course page) that make non-trivial use of permutation groups to understand finite automata. One important tool in hardware design is a "reset word" that takes the automaton from any state and brings it back to a fixed initial state. The key point being that you send the same message no matter what state the automaton is currently in, and no matter what it ends up in the fixed initial state, ready for new commands. The goal of the course is to make progress towards solving a conjecture that if an n-state automaton has a reset word at all, then it has a short one, that is, one of length at most (n−1)2. He also has a nice encyclopedia about "design theory". Block designs are highly symmetric arrangements that allow for efficient and accurate statistical experiments (I believe originally in agriculture, but now widely used in many areas, especially medicine) as well as dense codes in coding theory. I first learned about them in the local cryptography seminar where they were used to give better understanding of some algebraic stream ciphers. If you do not currently have problems you want to solve using group theory, but want to learn to solve some beautiful problems in and using group theory, then I found Butler's Fundamental Algorithms of Permutation Groups to be quite good. It uses spanning trees to solve a fundamental problem in permutation groups, and shows several very good examples of how permutation groups let you very naturally prune an exponential search tree down to something that will work like a charm in practice. The open source GAP has many of these algorithms implemented in fairly easy to read procedural language (like C, but with garbage collection). It of course also has many of the modern solutions to the same problems, so you can also see how things have improved.
