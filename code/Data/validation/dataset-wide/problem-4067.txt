One little counterexample (to both versions of the question). On a quintic $3$-fold in $\mathbb CP^4$ there are $2875$ lines. You can take any of these lines. An analytic neighbourhood of such a line is the one of the small resolution of the cone $x_1^2+x_2^2+x_3^2+x_4^2=0$. So there can be no curves in the neighbourhood of such a line, since the cone is affine. This example is not surprising, since the normal bundle to such a line is $O(-1)\oplus O(-1)$, one needs at least a bit of positivity... 

Such extension exists. This follows from the followoing three facts. 1) For every point $x\in X$ there is a neighbourhood $U(x)\subset M$ and a holomorphic map $\phi: U(x)\to \mathbb C^n$ such that $\phi (U(x)\cap X)\subset \mathbb R^n$. 2) Let $\alpha$ be a real analytic two-form defined on $\mathbb R^n$, then it can be extended to a holomorphic two-form on a neighbourhood of $\mathbb R^n$ in $\mathbb C^n$ that retracts on $\mathbb R^n$ 3) If you have two extensions of $\alpha$ to a same neighbourhoods of $\mathbb R^n$ then they coincide. I don't know a reference for 1) but it should be something standard, to get 2) and 3) you can just use Taylor decomposition of $\alpha$. Once you know 1,2,3 the statement follows easily. 

This answer is completely rewritten. This is not an actual answer but a thought related to the question. I decided to leave it hear since it is short. Note first that if there is a regular map from a surface $X$ to $\mathbb P^3$ whose image has only isolated singularities, then $X$ has curves with negative self-intersection. In particular, if $X$ has no such curves then its image in $\mathbb P^3$ is smooth. Now, suppose we have a surface $X$ with isolated singularities in $\mathbb CP^3$, say of general type and consider the question: Question. Let $X'$ be the minimal resolution of singularities on $X$. Can we say something about $X$ if $X'$ contains rational $-1$ curves? 

I would like to find a reference for a beautiful construction that associates to Del-Pezzo surfaces hyperbolic Coxeter polytopes of finite volume and ask some related questions. Recall that a hyperbolic Coxeter polytope is a domain in $\mathbb H^n$ bounded by a collection of geodesic hyperplanes, such that each intersecting couple of hyperplanes intersect under angle $\frac{\pi}{n}$ ($n=2,3,...,+\infty$). Del Pezzo surface is a projective surface obtained from $\mathbb CP^2$ by blowing up (generically) at most $8$ points. Now, the construction Del Pezzo $\to$ Coxeter polytope goes as follows. Consider $H_2(X,\mathbb R)$, this is a space endowed with quadratic form of index $(1,n)$ (the intersection form), and there is a finite collection of vectors $v_i$ corresponding complex lines on $X$ with self-intersection $-1$. It is well known, for example that on a cubic surface in $\mathbb CP^3$ there are $27$ lines and this collection of lines has $E_6$ symmetry (if you consider it as a subset in $H_2(X,\mathbb Z)$). Now we just take the nef cone of $X$, or in simple terms the cone in $H_2(X,\mathbb R)$ of vectors that pair non-negatively with all vectors $v_i$. This cone cuts a polytope from the hyperbolic space corresponding to $H_2(X,\mathbb R)$, and it is easy to check that this polytope is Coxeter, with angles $\frac{\pi}{2}$ and $0$ (some points of this polytope are at infinity, but its volume is finite). Indeed, angles are $\frac{\pi}{2}$ and $0$ since $v_i^2=-1$, $v_i\cdot v_j=0 \;\mathrm{or}\; 1$. Example. If we blow up $\mathbb CP^2$ in two points this construction produces a hyperbolic triangle with one angle $\frac{\pi}{2}$ and two angles $0$. The connection between algebraic surfaces an hyperbolic geometry is very well-known, and exploited all the time but for some reason I was not able to find the reference to this undoubtedly classical fact (after some amount of googling). So, Question 1. Is there a (nice) reference for this classical fact? This question is motivated in particular by the following article $URL$ where the polytope corresponding to the cubic surface is used. The authors mention the relation of the polytope to 27 lines on the cubic, but don't say that the relation is in fact almost canonical. Question 2. The group of symplectomorhpisms (diffeos) of each Del-Pezzo surface $X$ is acting on $H_2(X,\mathbb R)$, let us denote by $\Gamma$ its image in the isometries of corresponding hyperbolic space. What is the relation between $\Gamma$ and the group generated by reflections in the faces of the corresponding Coxeter polytope? PS It one considers rational surfaces with semi-ample anti-canonical bundles, i.e. surfaces that can have only rational curves with self-intersection $-1$ and $-2$ one gets more examples of Coxeter polytopes; the faces of such polytopes intersect under angles $(\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{3}, \frac{\pi}{4}, 0)$. Here is a reference on "Algebraic surfaces and hyperbolic geometry" (but I don't think that the answer to question one is contained there) : $URL$ 

Let us prove that for an affine variety $X$ every line bundle $E$ is "positive" according to the chosen defintion. All we need to prove is that for any hermitian metric $g$ on $E$ with curvature $w$ there is a Kahler form $w_1$ on $X$ such that $w_1>-w$. Since $X$ is affine, for any $w_1$ we have $w_1=\frac{i}{2\pi}\partial\bar\partial (f_1)$ and changing the metric $g$ on $E$ by $ge^{f_1}$ we corresponing curvature will change from $w$ to $w+w_1$, which we assume to be positive. So we need to show the existence of arbitrary large $w_1$. Since $X$ is affine and hence admits an embedding in $\mathbb C^n$, it is enough to show this for $\mathbb C^n$. Moreover, since $\mathbb C^n=\mathbb C^1\times ...\times \mathbb C^1$ it is enought to prove the statement for $\mathbb C^1$. Now, on $\mathbb C^1$ every form of the shape $w_1=h_1dz\wedge d\bar z$ is Kahler for $h_1>0$ and we can chose $h_1$ as large as we wish. The conclusion is that if one choses this definition, then each line bundle on an affine $X$ is positive, which sounds strange. So I am not sure what should be a reasonable definition of positivincess in non-compact case, if it exists at all. 

Yes, it is always possible. Of course, if $M$ has dimension $2$ we need to assume that $\gamma$ is embedded in $M$ in which case the statement is easy (but if $\gamma$ have self-intersections, the statement does not hold necessarily). If $dim(M)$ is at least $4$, then the statement can be deduced from the following two: 1) Let $\gamma_t$ be a smooth family of embedded loops in $M$ such that for any $t_1,t_2$ the integral of $\omega$ over the cylinder swiped by loops $\gamma_t$, $t\in [t_1,t_2]$ is zero. Then for any $t_1,t_2$ there is a Hamiltonian isotopy on $M$ that takes $\gamma_{t_1}$ to $\gamma_{t_2}$. This can be proven by constructing a family of Hamiltoninas $H_t$ parametrised by $t$ and considering the corresponding flow on $M$ (infinitesimally $H_t$ takes $\gamma_t$ to $\gamma_{t+\Delta t}$). 2) Provided $dim(M)>2$ each contractible loop can be contracted to an arbitrarily small neighbourhood of a point on $M$ by the homotopy having the property of 1) (i.e. preserving symplectic action). 

This is more like a comment that in order to get a positive answer you need to specify more data. Let us consider the simplest situation when $Z$ is empty, so $H^{\ast}(X)\to H^{\ast}(Z)$ is the zero map. It might happen in this situation, that there is more than one (unramified) double cover of $X$ and moreover double covers have different Betti numbers. Of course Hodge diamonds will be different as well. Example. Consider the elliptic curve $E=\mathbb C/(\mathbb Z+i\mathbb Z)$. Let $X=(E\times E)/\sigma$ be the quotient of $E\times E$ by the following fixed point free involution: $(x,y)\to (-x,y+\frac{1}{2})$. Then $X$ has several unramified double covers. One obvious cover is $E\times E$ that we started with. A different cover of $X$ can be obtained from $E\times E$ by taking a double cover of the first factor and then taking a quotient by the lift of $\sigma$. This cover has same topology as $X$ and hence different $b_1$ from $E\times E$. Indeed, $b_1(X)=2\ne 4=b_1(E\times E)$. 

If your manifold is complex projective, then the answer is yes. Otherwise it is no. You can take a $K3$ surface without complex curves and just consider its tangent bundle. Of curse it will stay holomorphically non-trivial, if you throw away finite number of points from $K3$, since any holomorphic vector field on a $K3$ surface defined outside a finite set is zero. On the other hand, I guess, in this example the bundle is topoligcally trivial, since its first Chern class is zero. Added. Let me sketch the proof of the statement, everything holds for compact complex aglebraic manifold. First every such a manifold admits a blow up that is projective. Pull back the complex bundle to the blow up. Then we get a holomorphic bundle over a complex projective manifold and such a bundle is algebraic. Hence it has meromorphic sections. Moreover we can chose meromorphic sections that a linearly independent at one point. It is clear that they trivialise the bundle over a complement to a complex analytic manifold. 

Evgeny, here are some remarks on your variety. First, I think it should be possible indeed to prove that the whole group of symmetries of this variety is $G=SL(3,C)xSL(3,C)$ (plus a finite discrete bit, as Evgeny noted below). One first needs to show that the stabiliser of your 3-form is G, this is worked out in details in a very nice paper of Hitchin "The geometry of three-forms in six and seven dimensions" $URL$ You can check pages 3-5. Then it is sufficient to show that all symmetries of your variety extend to symmetries of $G(3,6)$ an my feeling this will be the case... As for your idea of constructing vanishing cycles, you can try to deform your variety, which just corresponds to deforming the 3-form. Now, you should take the less degenerate 3-form, maybe this will be $dx_1\wedge (dx_2\wedge dx_3+dx_4\wedge dx_5)$? (If not, Hitchin's article should help I guess). You can study the singularites of the deformed variety and if by a miracle the singularity will be just a double point, that can hint you tovards what is the vanishing cycle... ADDED. Let me try to give an argument that could prove potentially that all automorphism of $M(3,6)=X$ may well come from $GL(6,C)$. The Grassmanian $G(3,6)=G$ has a natural (Plucker) embedding to $CP^{19}$, the projectivisation of the third exterior power $\Lamda^3(C^6)$. The subvariety $X$ is given by a hyperplane section (indeed, every exerior 3-form of $C^6$ difines a hyperplane $CP^{18}$ in it. Let us argue first, that Aut(X) extends to $Aut(CP^{18})$. $X$ is a Fano variety with $Pic(X)=Z$. So the bundle $O(1)$ on $CP^{18}$ should be a positive power of the anti-canonical bundle of X. If $O(1)=-nK(X)$ with n positive integer, then, since the action of $Aut(X)$ naturally lifts to the action on $K(X)$, it also acts on the sections of $-nK(X)=O(1)$, and so on $C^{19}$ as well as on its projectivisation $CP^{19}$. If $n$ is just a positive rational nubmer we don't get an action on $C^{19}$, but we still get an action on its projectivisation, I guess. Now we need to show, that in reality this action of $Aut(X)$ on $CP^{18}$ extends to the action on $CP^{19}$ that moreover preserves $Gr(3,6)$. I don't see how to do it for the moment. Maybe it is worth to ask a specialist on Fano varieties...
