Yes, atheism is not Scientific, and, by inference, yes, agnosticism is more in line with Science. (Although if by chance you reference the subculture/identity/movement of Atheism, which includes figures such as Richard Dawkins, the definition of the tenets of this movement encompass both the definition given above and your concordant definition of agnosticism. Another definition of 'atheist' is simply the negation of 'theist' i.e. anything which is not Theism, as in, to encompass not only agnosticism but also the explicit view that deities do not exist.) 

There are various criticisms related to Epicurus' argument which do exist. However, there are not as of yet valid criticisms of the argument itself. Logically speaking, it is perfectly valid. The implication of his argument is that one should not fear death, however literally all his argument is saying is that "death is nothing to us," which is perfectly true. You mention that one may fear leaving loved ones behind, but this is the same as fearing death, per Epicurus: They are both things that will never happen to you: When you die, and no longer are with your loved ones, you are, by definition, no longer in existence. And therefore the loss of your loved ones is nothing to you, and has not and will not happen to you. Death, therefore, the most awful of evils, is nothing to us, seeing that, when we are, death is not come, and, when death is come, we are not. It is nothing, then, either to the living or to the dead, for with the living it is not and the dead exist no longer. $URL$ 

Phenomenology, was, perhaps, the most sustained effort to excise this division from ontology. It begins with Husserl's notion of intentionality and his famous dictum that "consciousness is always the consciousness of something", but finds its full force in Heidegger's Being and Time and his notion of being-in-the-world. Perhaps even more explicitly, Merleau-Ponty's Phenomenology of Perception is the criticism of the mind-body distinction. Although phenomenology is a movement, not a set of doctrines, the main idea shared by phenomenologists is that 'things' (objects) cannot be separated from those who perceive them. Hence the emphasis on examining meanings rather than things, and hence the erasure of the subject/object distinction. Phenomenology does not so much resolve Cartesian dualism as shows how it is a superfluous distinction. 

In Anti-Oedipus the concept of multiplicity is directly related to desiring-production (which, in turn, is directly related to the notions of desiring machines and flows): 

Biopower operates on the level of populations. It is, in a sense, myopic in respect to particular individuals. The issues of concern for biopower are, for example, hygiene, health, birth and mortality rate. All of the above become objects of active manipulation: 

One example. As it was mentioned above, biopower is exercised across populations (regularization of birth rates, longevity etc.) and is myopic to particular individuals. It promotes life or lets die. An interesting example of the problematic nature of this approach is the "left-to-die boat" case. In 2011 sixty three Lybian migrants died after drifting for fourteen days in an area heavily monitored by NATO. They were noticed, of course, but all kinds of complex maritime jurisdiction trickery was used to avoid responsibility for rescuing the Lybians. Abstaining from rescue can be as potent a killing as targeted murder. Governing migration, and especially when it comes to refugees, is the prime and telling example of biopolitics in action.

Is time a mental abstraction or does it exist outside consciousness? The latter. Time exists independently of us. In all likelihood, time exists independently of one's consciousness. That is to say, while it may be that the experience which we refer to as the passage of time is in part created by our brains, there is still a physical process which it corresponds to, and this is something which cannot be suspended or initiated by our brains. While it's possible that time only exists when there is something there to 'observe' it, time certainly still exists when people aren't around, as can be verified by simply using a video/tape recorder to record events in an area which is devoid of people or even all intelligent life (within a certain radius). Alternatively, there is any number of subtle signs in everything which suggest that physical processes proceed without direct human/animal observation. Infinite timelines Does time stretch infinitely backward or have a starting point? You say that either of these possibilities are less preferable to the option of time merely being an abstraction of the brain, and I understand this if you associate the idea of a non infinite timeline specifically with the idea of a deity. Also your option 1) (infinitely backwards timeline) involves the idea of infinity, which indeed may be internally contradictory in some way. However, the possibility of time having a definite start point does not necessitate that there is some "entity" out there which initiated the timeline. That being said, I don't know how to differentiate between option 1) and 2). All that we know is that the answer to 3) is that time proceeds without us, in some shape or form. 

I suggest viewing all math as modeling a possible world. In your hypothetical scenario, one cannot use a static probability to back the coin. Interestingly enough, your hypothetical is virtually identical to a hypothetical discussed in the history of the philosophy of science: 

To 'divine' a purpose is to act as a god: it is to tell a story that shapes reality according to one's will. From George Herbert's A Dialogue-Anthem: 

The better explanation is B), for people are naturally terrible at introspection, but predictable if you can model them well. You have presumed that we know the modeling parameters—"you know for a fact exactly what someone's actual goals and desires are"—and we know that there exists ways to predict how people will operate. The secret comes from the term "Predictably Irrational", which is also a book title: we must be rational not according to a person's     (1) "self-reported reason", but instead his/her     (2) "actual goals and desires". In some sense, this seems like it will be a dissatisfying answer to your question, because it is not clear how well we can actually measure (2). It is not clear we can ever know a person's actual "goals and desires". If our options are instead, 

The Enlightenment can be seen as an "abandoning of Aristotle"; one such feature of that is to abandon his Four Causes, or at least abandon the formal and final causes, such that the only ones that matter are the material and efficient causes. And so, 'science' is defined as caring only about knowledge that gives you power over reality. It is no mistake that we have the phrase, "Knowledge is Power!" Humans are not objects to be controlled There is a very specific place where this Enlightenment attitude falls apart: humans. Consider the following attitude of Daniel Dennett, as described by R. Scott Smith in In Search of Moral Knowledge: Overcoming the Fact-Value Dichotomy:
