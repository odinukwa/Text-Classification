I believe having a motivating life situation, combined with a teacher (or learning material) you connect well with is critical. I had no teacher available, and started by reading the Salzburg book. It instantly resonated, made perfect sense to me, and was highly motivating. Some authors are equally well reviewed, yet I finish their book and think, meh. How confident are you that you've found your best ways to learn and train that fit your brain in particular? . Have you modified the recitations to be something other than the verbatim, defaults that everyone tends to talks about when explaining things? I spent a fair amount of time trying different variations and refining them, trying to make each iteration closer to something that I could feel strongly inside myself, and that reflected the direction I knew I most needed to move toward. . The idea of having any connection with an enemy, hated person, or worse, someone innately evil, kind of scared me as far as worrying I'd never even be able to come close to achieving it. Consequently I dwelled on the easy levels for a long time, for months, just trying to improve as much as I could on the basics. Is it possible this (dumb luck) strategy somehow allowed a lot of positive reinforcement before getting to the hard stuff? I'm not sure. How long did you study and practice before you tried the some of the difficult stuff? 

Thus we can say that consciousness is a result of contact. It looks like ocean waves: there is something beneath (water, an organ of perception) and something above (wind, perceived object). We can say that consciousness doesn't exist if there is no contact of organ of perception and object of perception. Usually we imagine consciousness as some space that exists independently of everything else; when things appear in that space, they become perceived. But Dharma asks us: are we sure that there is that immutable, metaphysical space called Consciousness? We only know directly that consciousness appears when there is contact of organ and object. Does consciousness really exist apart from that? If we examine that question, we can conclude that there is no actual reason to claim that consciousness exists constantly and independently; it's just our mental model. Though we can speak about the reality as Only Consciousness (and sometimes it's useful), that is just our modeling; in direct perception Consciousness doesn't really exist (as something absolute or independent). That helps to realize emptiness - no self - of all things and objects. Actually all objects are our mental models we create from fluid momentary appearances. Objects do not exist in themselves. They are only our way to associate individual sense data. Then we can make another step and say that "objects of perception" and "organs of perception" are in fact our mental models. The primary phenomena are momentary appearances. "Waves of consciousness". It's like there are waves, like electromagnetic waves, but we imagine them as ocean waves, with something beneath and something above. In fact, for direct observation something appears. And then we build some mental models on top of that - adding there dualities, like "object" and "organ", or "mind" and "matter". Consider this: looking at sea, we see waves, and we conclude that there is water beneath and wind above. Likewise, from "consciousness" we conclude there are forms and mentations of them (rupa & nama). So various explanations are possible: that from nama-rupa consciousness appears, and that from consciousness nama-rupa appear. In both cases we talk about the process of creation of mental models. Awakening and liberation from delusion means we drop thinking of mental models as real things. It's very sublime Dharma, very hard to understand without direct contemplation. 

Imagine you separate each of these from your body and see them individually. If you see these things separately, you don't consider them as a body or a human.You might recognize them as blood, piece of bone or piece of flesh etc. But when they are together you recognize it as the body. That is the wrong saññā(identification). Body never exist anywhere in the future,past or present. Only these 32 parts where there. If you go deeper you might realize each of these part is just combination of patavi,aapo,thejo and wayo. So ultimately, what really exists is 4 fundamentals, not anything else. when you realize what you see from the mirror is not your body and just combination of four fundamentals.You will not recognize it as body and you will see it as a combination. patavi is toughness it belongs to land.. everything in your body made of patavi will decay and added up to soil one day. aapo is the liquidity and it belongs to ocean.. everything in your body made of aapo will wash away and collect to the ocean. thejo is the temparature inside the body.. it will mix with the atmosphere once you dead and add to the fire. wayo is the air inside the body and it will mix to the atmosphere and blow away with the wind.. So if you cannot control these four factors,obviously you cannot control a combination of them as well. So there is no point of telling "body" is mine. correct your saññā(identification) about the "body" according to Buddhism then you will see the truth. 

Other chanting answers tend to explain tradition, but this question only concerns practicality. Are the benefits of chanting exclusive, or can your practice easily be full and productive using other techniques? For example, I don't sit lotus for any special reason. Simply to maximize stability and lessen distraction while meditating. Could someone develop a great practice sitting in a chair instead? I would guess they could, without necessarily missing something important. On the contrary, if someone wanted to understand and fully benefit from Buddhism by becoming a master scholar, yet without putting in serious time meditating, I can't see how they'd even really achieve understanding let alone full benefit. So which is it in this case? Is chanting just one of many paths of practice that is good, but not the only way? Or is it something fundamental such that omitting it is necessarily a detriment? (if it matters, I most often study metta meditation personally, but often sit with diverse groups where chanting is done) 

My guess would be that you are making it harder than it might otherwise be. I don't mean to imply you are "doing it wrong". Persisting and seeking feedback as you are doing here is already such an important milestone. May I ask how you are guiding yourself? Are you are working with a teacher (so many times we don't have that luxury)? Are you learning from dharma talks, or if reading, what material are you studying? It'a such a personal journey. It's hard to say why it seems so difficult to you, yet seems life changingly blissful and beautiful to me (with some rough spots of course!). How can this night and day difference between us in experience be explained? Especially if I confide to you that by nature I'm not a spiritual person, fairly cynical, and not a people person to the point I would prefer not to receive an invitation to a great party? The point is, although we can't know for sure why you are struggling, it seems intuitive that if I could find a path, you have it in yourself to find one as well. Some points that may or may not be relevant to you: 

I recommend you metta meditation. It is simple meditation you can do even when you are traveling in a bus etc. Basically what metta meditation does is, it help us to think about others well being and betterment with wishing their success. We can do metta meditation direction wise or group wise. Read meththanisansa sutra and karaneeyametta sutra for further information. First thing a person do in meththa meditation is hope the well being of himself 

"Chethanaham bhikkawe kamman wadami chethaithwa , kamman karothi kayena waachaya manasa" always karma depends on the chiththa(thought). So we cannot see it from the outside. Same karma looks similler from the outside might be different according to the thoughts... so always most important thing behind karma is the thought it is based on.. 

Forgiveness explained in budhdism is tolerance. If someone does a harm on you it is non of your bussiness. That person will bring the karma for what he did. If you avenge it is something you are collecting. So tolerance is the best option. 

This way you can spread metta for all 10 directions or for parents, relations, neighbors ,people who are friendly, people who are neutral, people who are hatred etc.... From this meditation you can earn 11 benefits during this life..read them on those sutras. In practical mannaer you can spread metta at any time.. for example, when you are going to work in early morning.. hope all people who are walking to work... going on bus.. going on train etc may they all happy today.. may everything they do be successful..etc. When you see a person with a illness sadness or any problem, spread metta to him... may this person be recovered from the illness..may this person happy and peaceful etc.... When you hear of see an ambulance is passing by..in your mind think may this person feel well, may this person recover from illness.. may this person live long etc. Developing these kind of thoughts will automatically brings those people's love , affection and kindness to you back too. 

PS. Several practical tips 1. Take the responsibility Ordinary attitude is: "The world is so bad that my life is in misery, and I can't do anything about it". Better attitude is: "Whatever be the world, I wish to use my life for the benefit of all beings". Reasoning: Letting conditions make me waste my life has no sense. So regardless of conditions I decide to use my life wisely. With that in mind, make a resolution to be responsible for your life and death by yourself, not letting adverse conditions make you useless. 2. Drop inner oppositions Ordinary attitude is: "I should force myself to be a decent, effective person". Better attitude is: "Whatever qualities I manifest, it's a resource and a field of exploration". Reasoning: Trying to force themselves, people divide in themselves, try to manipulate with themselves and act against themselves. That leads to wasting efforts in struggles and creating inner resistance to our own endeavors. With that in mind, you decide to accept whatever manifests in your mental continuum as a resource and a field of exploration - not struggling with that, but dissolving oppositions. 

The main principle of happiness and freedom, especially emphasized in Mahayana Buddhism, is unselfishness: (1) We feel concerns about ourselves, and about various conditions which also focus into ourselves. These concerns are created by fixations on good and bad - as they exist from our point of view. For example, I see the modern human world as cruel, unjust, full of stupidity, destroying the life on Earth, doomed. But that view comes from my particular perspective. If I take into account that in the past millions of people in Europe died from plague and famine, and many were burned alive for their views, I could understand that some progress actually happened. We can conduct an experiment: think about the same ugly things when we are in a good mood. Then probably negative thoughts would not stay for so long, they would not occupy our mind. That experiment shows that habitual thoughts accompany our emotional state. In an easy state we would have more optimistic view on the same problems. Therefore, (2) We can drop our self-centered concerns, and shift our attention to caring about others. You might say it looks like too simple idea to really work well, but then let me ask: have you tried? Mahayana has thoroughly developed system, called the way of perfections (paramitas). Most often we speak about Six paramitas (they are the main core of the path). 

The question you asked is directly combined with the concept of saññā(identification). From the day we born in this world, we sense things around us and recognize them according to the external world. For example, when you first see an object like chair, you don't have any idea that it is a chair. But the knowledge you get from the outside, lead you to believe that it is a chair. So, next time you see a similar shape, you understand that is also a chair. That's how conventional world is built. But actually, what we see is not what exists. Everything in this universe is made of 4 fundamental things patavi,aapo ,thejo and wayo. Nothing is beyond that.Anything you see from your eyes is just a combination of these 4 elements.Only the outer appearance differs according to the element percentages. As an example if you consider water => aapo is the dominant factor... for a rock => patavi is the dominant factor. The names you use for them are just set of words nothing more. When you consider about the body, first thing you need to know is, the name "body" is just a word. What you feel when you touch yourself and what you see from the mirror is just a combination of 4 factors mentioned above. In the Buddhism human body is beautifully described. Human body is made of 32 parts.
