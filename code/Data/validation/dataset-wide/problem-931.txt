I can't think of any test you can do at home to distinguish Jade, either Jadeite or Nephrite, from a massive Agate, or even a highly coloured Chert. You'll want cotton wheels with polishing compound on a drill, angle grinder, or pedestal/bench grinder for cleaning up any unfinished surface and bonded diamond rotary bits either for a drill (hand or press), or a hobby tool, for the carving. Be warned that jade is a notoriously fickle subject when you're carving, so are agate and chert for that matter, prone to splintering along carved edges and to bodily cracking up under pressure. 

Looking at your equations and assuming you've plugged in the right numbers everything looks right, what doesn't look right is question b.; Watts per metre has no place in such an equation it just doesn't fit the question, all the units should be expressed and calculated in square metres, and the answer you have in the last section is. 

Based on outward appearance I'd say Agate, but it could also be Calcite, a little vinegar can be used for a reactivity test, if it bubbles when introduced to the surface then you have calcite otherwise you'd be well advised to do a scratch test in case you have something really different be I'd say Agate. 

Dead-ice is a term used to refer to lumps of ice left behind by a retreating glacier, they're generally cloaked in thick layers of debris that insulate them from solar heating, they don't necessarily show a current state of retreat as they can persist for many years after the glacier abandons them. Moraine Push is a sign of current advancement or surge of the glacier, basically the glacier bulldozers existing moraine deposits as it advances down valley, this creates several telltale formations, ice flowing over the top of lateral moraines, established moraines (trees and all) being churned and pushed over by advancing ice. I have heard that terminal lakes are only ever found in glacial valleys with retreating ice, as they form between the face or toe of the glacier and the terminal moraine formed by a stable glacier this could well be accurate. 

Millimeters per year measurements have an area component built into them, they're actually in cubic millimeters per square millimeter. So one millimeter of rainfall is enough to cover the given area that rainfall is for to an average depth of one millimeter. For example if the area is a 100 square kilometer catchment then 1mm of rainfall is 100,000,000 cubic millimeters (also millilitres), or 100,000 litres of water. Evapotranspiration is measured using exactly the same unit conventions. Hope that helps. 

The eutectic is the minimum melting point of a mixed material, like soda lime glass made from sodium hydroxide, calcium oxide, and silicon dioxide. That mixture, in the proper proportions, lowers the melting point of quartz sand (silicon dioxide) from 1700 to under 1000 Celsius. In the mantle the mixture is far more complex but if I remember my geochemistry Aluminium, Iron, Magnesium, and Calcium are the main elements that lower the melting point of pure silica in magmatic melts. Water can be very important as it not only lowers the melting point of saturated rocks but also carries heat into lower temperature melting materials, especially in subduction zones. 

It can be either an eruption from the top of an existing tube or deep surface cracks opening up existing magmatic systems. I believe, from what I've been hearing in the news, that in this case they are in fact fresh fractures, tectonic in origin, that have relieved local over burden and allowed magma to rise to the surface in areas that had previously been dormant for an extended period. 

I only know of two or three minerals that are waxy to touch, Serpentine, Talc which is often a metamorphic product of serpentine, and Magnesite. In my experience Talc and Serpentine are very soft and can be anything from yellow through a number of greens to pale blue while magnesite is a darker navy blue colour and much harder. The three often come mixed together which makes even the best ID shaky, I'd suggest that you need to do some tests as to the hardness of your samples for a start. 

Assuming that the identification of the rock as Flint/Chert and not Limestone/Dolomite is correct I'd say it's a formation artifact rather than a fossil. What I mean is that at some point as it was forming, flint can form in two ways one is due to silica saturated water acting on limestone and the other is by direct precipitation from mineral saturated water in shallow environments, the small bead-like structures were created within or on the surface of the rock. It may be a surface impression from a fossil that was once part of a larger piece but as it is now there's no evidence of a material difference between "fossil" and the country rock of the flint. This opinion is coloured by the fact that here in New Zealand fossils in our flint are vanishingly rare, I'm not sure if that holds in England though. 

Could be Agate, Travertine, Halite, Chert (flint) or any of a few others; is it reactive to acid or hot water? If it fizzes in mild acid it's a calcite material like Travertine or Marble, Hot water dissolution would mean it's Halite (rock salt). Otherwise you're looking at a silicate, from the colour and texture I'd say Agate or possibly Chert. 

Higher amplitude waves, on water, are caused by larger disturbances and longer durations of energy input, in the form of wind, than smaller ones. Quite simply in order to build a big ocean wave you need to put in a lot of acceleration of surface waters over an extended period of time. So it's not just that the wave itself is travelling that much faster, the whole surface that the wave is moving on is itself moving in the same direction as the wave on the surface. The larger amplitude of the waves is in fact partly due to them going faster rather than the other way around. NB: This doesn't apply with Tsunami waves as those are full column disruptions involving the water column from seabed to wave crest.
