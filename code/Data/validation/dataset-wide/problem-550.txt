Update: addressing this statement from the OP (edited), as I think it's crux of the misunderstanding. ...with a smaller [rear sprocket] you obtain [higher] velocity than with a bigger [rear sprocket], applying same human power... That would be true if human power was replaced with pedaling rotational speed. 

Googling 'Shimano CS-6800 cassette' should convince you that Ultegra 6800 cassette are still available, even though that groupset has been superseded by R8000. Any suitably high-end and light 11 speed Shimano compatible (i.e. Shimano and SRAM) cassette that you can find in you desired spread of sprockets will work. You will need to check that your rear derailleur has the required total capacity (difference in teeth in the cassette + difference in teeth between chainrings), and can handle a 32 tooth large sprocket. If not you will need to swap the derailleur for a compatible one with a longer cage. 

If the sound is occurring once per revolution it must be related to the disc being at least slightly out of true. With the bike off the ground rotate the wheel and look at the disc in the caliper. Check to see if it's touching the pads at any point. You may need to re-adjust the caliper position. I'd be suspicious of a bit of grit or metal stuck in the in the pad. Take them out and see of there is a foreign object stuck in the surface. Also look for a circular scratch or mark on the disc braking surfaces. 

Yep, that looks like some pretty extensive cracking. I'm sure this is obvious to you, but do not ride this bike as the frame may fail catastrophically. 

'Crankshaft' if not the name of a bike component and is somewhat ambiguous (some people don't know the proper component names - no offense meant by pointing this out). You could be talking about the bottom bracket, which is the spindle connecting the cranks and its bearings; or you might mean the cranks themselves. It's probably not worth upgrading components on an older inexpensive bike unless they are worn out or broken. Such a bike can benefit from a good servicing though. On an older Tourney equipped bike you most likely have a bottom bracket with a square taper spindle that the cranks attach to. The bottom bracket will be an adjustable or cassette type. On an older bike the bottom bracket may well be worn. If it does not spin freely or there is any play in the bearings it's worn (or needs adjusting). There are some guides available for servicing or replacing adjustable and cassette bottom brackets. Be aware you'll need special tools for removing the cranks and adjusting or removing the bracket. If you need to replace a cassette type (or replace an adjustable with a cassette) you need to know the bottom bracket shell with (68 or 73mm) and the spindle length. The shell width and threads are standardized. If you are thinking about replacing the whole crank, consider replacing just the chainrings as they are the part that wears. If you really want to replace the crank you need one that is for the square taper bottom bracket. Any triple crank for square taper should be compatible. 

If the cable is moving near the derailleur when the shifter is operated, check the cable is attached to the derailleur. 

Replace the damaged chain links with new links from the small length of chain left over when you shortened the new chain, using two new connecting pins, and being extra careful to not screw it up this time. Replace the damaged outer chain links with a Shimano Quick Link. Beware that most quick links are one-time use so make sure the chain is routed properly before completing installation. 

With the last option you are not paying for new hubs, but you will have to pay for the wheel to be built up. 

Contrary to seemingly popular belief there is no giant database of bike serial numbers, manufacturers, models and original components that people with sufficient reputation on Bicycle Stack Exchange magically have access to. If you want to build a bike up from a frame you simply have to learn about the various standards and sizes of wheels and hubs, bottom brackets and cranks, seatpost diameters, head set bearings and steerer tube diameters, brake mountings etc etc etc. Additionally, for any bike there is a vast selection of different components available. You will get to make a lot of choices about style, cost, weight and quality. The Park Tool Company articles and YouTube Channel are my favorite resources. They focus on current road and mountain bikes and don't have much BMX specific content. A great deal will be applicable to BMX bikes though. 

You didn't complain of sit bone soreness, but might want to contemplate a wider saddle as @Batman suggested in his/her comment. Some riding techniques you can try: 

if you mean X then you likely have room for a bigger chainring. If you mean Y then you are probably out of luck. Using a formula for the radius of an n sided polygon and assuming tooth profile does not significantly vary for different size chainrings, each additional tooth adds about 2mm of radius to the chainring. 

Wrap the bikes in plastic stretch wrap used for protecting furniture when moving house. It wraps tightly so will not whip around and should be much easier to shape around a bike than a polyethylene tarpaulin. Secure with judicious amounts of packing tape. You can poke holes in it for the rack arms to go through (or put the bikes on the rack then wrap them). You want to protect against crud coming up off of the road surface so a few holes at the top will not matter. Perhaps put a couple of square feet of cardboard inside the wrap to soak up any moisture that manages to get inside. 

The pads are positioned reasonably close to the rim so the brakes are probably be adjusted correctly. The does not appear to be rubbing on the pads. It will most likely not be a problem. Whether this is acceptable on a new bike depends on the quality and cost of the bike. Most bicycle purchases come with a free tune-up after a short period of time, and a good bike store should deal with minor issues for no cost. Have the store take a look at it. 

I think that in general the last couple of digits in Shimano component names/codes denote variations in the spec or quality level of the components. One can dig around in Shimano's tech documents looking for answers. Current URL is $URL$ The Line Up Chart offers some insight into the compatibility of current parts (note there is an archive also). The Nexus Inter 8 Chart indicates that the SG-C6001-8R hub can be used with the SL-S503 lever. I note that the the 8R postfix in the hub name denotes 'roller brake spec', but I'm not sure if that means it has a roller brake built in or it is compatible with a roller brake. There seems to be a specific compatibility with brake levers for roller brakes. Update: after reading the Sheldon Brown / Harris Cyclery page on roller brakes, I found out that the 'R' postfix hubs are compatible with an add on brake unit.
