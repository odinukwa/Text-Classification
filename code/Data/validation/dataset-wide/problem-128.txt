Sure. Many indian languages have similar sounds but very different scripts. Malayalam and Tamil are probably the best examples here. The two languages are barely mutually intelligible - some different word choices but enough that we understand ~50-70% of someone might be saying. However a simple word like dog.. നായ് in malayalam (pronounced nāy) நாய் in tamil, also pronounced Nāy So... as long as the sounds linked to letters are similar, its entirely possible to do that. 

I suspect rather than being 'mere' beasts of burden like a horse, they'd likely be dual purpose, as with my previous answer. If your dogs are big enough, and they can pull stuff like in my previous answer? Dog pulled artillery, with the dogs acting as organic guards for it. While some training needs to be done to acclimatize the dogs to the sound of artillery (or rocket) fire, you'll need to do this anyway. The poles did it to a lesser extent with a bear On the other end of the spectrum... 

The need to maintain a standing army against a large perceived threat. Space Above and Beyond had cloned/tank grown humans as a counter to rampant AIs going against humanity. In essence national survival trumps all. A culture where military service isn't seen as a noble profession, especially at the cannon fodder level. Conscription would be the traditional way to deal with this, but the political costs of this would be too high. "Clones arn't people" legally and culturally so it may be politically more acceptable to use them, especially in a war of offence. You can bring up clones from the beginning with specific values. Imagine a culture where right from the beginning your country is your father and your mother. You're brought up to fight, kill and die for your country. You're brought up as a mechanic or a rifleman, and effort isn't wasted on teaching you any skills you don't 'need' in your profession. With genetic engineering you can build in certain traits. Have a safety switch against a uprising by making them require specific supplements to live. Have bigger stronger infantry, leaner pilots designed to handle gforces better. Pick whichever gender does the task better and mass produce them. Disease resistance, and better natural fitness. 

Keeping it simple. I was gonna suggest the guy behind the door but we can go one step further. You could do the same with fingerprints (index cards with the fingerprints, and make the user do a fingerprint each time he wants to come in - compare the size and fingerprint patterns for entry manually). User identifies himself, makes a fingerprint impression, and that's filed away with the time (by someone else?). Also means you can't 'just' chop off someone's hand and use it. Designed correctly, you could seperate tasks so bribery is harder (one guy collects the fingerprint, a second one verifies it and tells a third one to open the door...) Alternative identification schemes may involve tatoos (which can be copied) or physical tokens (which can be lost or stolen) or some combination of these. User sticks his hand into a hole, and never has to see the person doing verification (so you don't know if its the same guy). It also could have a little guillotine in case someone tries to be smart and sticks a weapon in. 

I think The late Terry Prachett did it really well with his depiction of goblins - they were creatures who were considered to be dirty due to their tendancy to hoard their bodily wastes. Another example might be the pak'ma'ra of babylon 5 In both cases you have a culture that is outwardly disgusting - and misunderstood. The goblins were seen as dirty until their ability to craft and make beautiful things was discovered. The pak'ma'ra were derided as eaters of carrion but were a key part of the story and were capable of beautiful things. The trick really is to have a war of cultures based off misunderstanding. Goblins might be seen as vermin, but only really steal because they need to survive. Orcs might be at war with humans simply because their previous interactions have all been violent. So specifically? 

The problem with success is complacency. The US reached what many considered its zenith during the cold war. The british, during conflict with the germans and french. In a sense having someone to compete against is always a good thing. The americans reached space cause the russians did it, and they reached the moon cause they wanted to do it first. WW2 and its aftermath resulted in infrascture we still use today. (The modern day space race on the other hand, seems to be the indians trying to catch up everyone, the chinese trying to do what the russians and americans did in the 80s, the russians launching rockets cheap, and the americans... well, Nasa seems more focused on probes, the mainstream rocket companies are suddenly realising a few upstarts might beat em up and steal their lunch money). On a smaller scale, you can see this in asia too - with many economies driven by industry and infrascture slowing and settling down somewhat, with things not being as efficent as before. In the 70s, transport outages would probably result in our prime minister taking the bus. Now? We have widespread train outages and while there's a lot of plans to deal with it, there's less of a personal touch. Hungry countries get stuff done. If you're spending more time dealing with paperwork and politics nothing gets done. 

A lot of industrial processes use agricultural products as feedstock. Run a shell corporation or corporations dealing with food. If you need grain? Run a brewery. Siphon off some grain or 'reject' some of the supply, and send it off. Likewise run a cannery for vegitables, and have 'rejected' or 'offcuts' used to supply your needs. Milk might not meet "standards" for butterfat or such or "just went bad" Frozen meat could 'fail' inspections and be 'destroyed', funneling it into your underground lair. Considering that food is overproduced in many places, a quiet offer to purchase commodities meant to be destroyed at a fair price would likely make many small farmers happy. "Dispose" of it for them 'charging' them for it, while paying them under the table. 

A weaponised jackhammer on the other hand would be able to strike consistantly and with a good amount of force over a narrow, aimed area. With sufficent skill, you could use the hardened steel tip to crush or even dismantle parts of an enemy mech, arms, legs and so on. Another weapon that wouldn't rely on the momentum of the carrier would be a bangalore mine, or in this case, a bangalore lance. Tip with a shaped charge (for piecing or cutting), thermal lance or even a dummy tip for setting off reactive armour. 

If we assume benevolent deities who weren't simply using humanity One possibility is they were trying to bootstrap humanity. "Mythic ages" were dangerous places. There were generally hostile species (or even pantheons for other species who were against humanity). Gods, demigods and other such benevolent or semi benevolent entities might have helped mythic age humanity not get eaten like popcorn by monsters, or survive the local hostile demon, or demon like creatures. However once humanity was able to survive on its own, they didn't need direct divine intervention, and free agency without too much intervention was a more benevolent stratergy. 

Not as cheap as molotov cocktails (and that's a huge advantage of them) but lithium ion batteries burn pretty well. They are also hard to put out, and you can't put out the fire with water. Probably pair it up with a circuit that intentionally overloads them quickly and you can do a ton of damage. 

Any sufficiently trivial act of divine intervention is indistinguishable from magic. And vice versa. What's worth considering is scope, intent and presence. Divine intervention, to be considered as such, should either be an act designed to gain influence or protect a people. There's little difference between 'ritual magic' and 'ritual' in that sense. A 'minor' spell, like feeding a couple of hundred people with a few loaves of bread and some fish, or a tiny transmutation spell turning water into a somewhat tastier alcoholic beverage might be construed as divine intervention if enough people believe in it enough. Alternately scope. Set someone on fire, and you're a pyromaniac firemage. Set a whole nation on fire, and you might be an angry fire deity (or a divine monkey with his tail on fire). Something like the 'kamikaze' or divine wind in Japan was thought to be divine intervention cause of timing. In short, divine intervention could be beyond the scope of one or more casters. And of course, turning up, 'incognito' in 'divine voiceover' or even the 'GAZE UPON THE GLORY OF THE SUPREME BEING' some hindu gods were fond of would be a clear sign it was divine intervention 

Mobile, ablative armour. Many of the techniques used for stopping RPGs would work, at a larger scale. Oddly little difference between antimatter and a shaped charge, with space(d) armour and reactive armour working here. So, light spaced out armour, capable of moving pre-emptively out to cover holes in protection, far enough to withstand the effects of matter/antimatter annilation. You don't need solid mass and a lightweight, mostly empty material would mean its easier to move it around as needed. So.. Large plates of something like aerogel propelled by small motors with enough freedom as mobile ablative armour, forming a controlled defensive cloud. As units are destroyed they movie to cover holes in the armour, moving inwards. (another model would be brilliant pebbles with satillites creating a dumb cloud of lightweight chaff) Alternately they close in on the enemy so firing the gun would result in the ship firing the round annihilating itself. Chaff in this case would be a possibility too. While covering the entire arc of fire in chaff in space combat is impractical at best you could have your interceptors either break into chaff or have local interceptors release chaff after the first hit 

KISS. Maybe an slight aura of menace or radiance. Warmth perhaps. Very slightly glowiness. Of course, if this was the dread blade of skogroth the squirrel slayer, all the squirrels in the area going deadly silent... That said, first boring magical blade that came to mind was the blade from Conan the Barbarian, which he took from crom/the king in the barrow. It had one property. It wasn't rusty. Also was sharp. A unaged weapon in a pile of rusted out junk might work here. I'd also consider the elven blades from LOTR. They had fairly mundane magical properties, and fairly well leveled up stabbiness. 

I'd do things differently. seats are terrible for starfighters. Human designs assume 2 usable limbs and being seated is actually not that good as far as gforces go While humans haven't really gone for prone positions in aircraft, it makes a lot of sense for a species that's fine being on all 4s 

Simply, the energy requirements would not scale. One way to prevent in universe abuse is to increase the energy requirements with mass and distance and have it in an exponential fashion. You could store and release energy in a instant to jump, but artificial gravity would require power, over a long time. attracting say, a 300 kg creature to a nearby floor mounted gravity generator would be 'cheap'. Heck, you could use it to move cargo. As weight increases, power requirements increase, making gravity manipulation for permanent inter-spatial folds in space difficult. A 'jump drive' may work in this fashion since it pinches space for a infinitesimally short period of time. However a snap-back effect might happen, with the potential of massive energy release or other side effects, depending on your universe 

Wait Eventually the sun will explode expand into a red giant, taking out most of the solar system with it. What remnants of humanity that have left the solar system would likely meet the same fate elsewhere, or gradually evolve into something we wouldn't identify as human. Eventually? Perhaps the heat death of the universe will wipeout what's left Total cost? Absolutely nothing and you'll never live to regret it 

Depends by what you mean by 'crappy' Human form factors suck. Walkers are pretty darned inefficient. Lets consider the trash bin form factor. For example one of these 

You want all the water you can get - for radiation shielding. Nasa is looking at it. Build your shelter inside a great big cistern or a series of tanks, maybe with double walls with an outer layer shielding an inner layer. As long as there's no fallout contaminating your water you ought to be fine. The CDC's decontamination protocols seem more concerned with radioactive dust than water contamination anyway. If you water wasn't radioactive to start with you should be fine. (as an aside, human waste makes good shielding too. So if your outer layer of defensive water isn't radioactive, you could use that to store your "post consumer food", assuming you arn't using it as manure. You could also reclaim waste water (directly, through various filtration methods, or indirectly by use of it as humanure or as nutrients for hydrophonics). This could be through filteration,distillation, condensing ambient water vapor or other means. Just treat the whole structure like a stillsuit. Water's also a great way to store energy- you could possibly use a cycle or other pump to pump up water, and use it to turn a small generator for small sustained power needs. 

What you're essentially looking for is something that's fuel and oxidizer. White Phosporous's probably the good stuff. Add an oxidiser since space dosen't typically have an atmosphere, and something thick and sticky to carry it all and stick to surfaces, since there's no gravity in space. Maybe encapsulate the two chemicals so they don't react prematurely in heat-decomposing "cells". Since its space, lauching it as a stream makes no sense. Instead have them in canisters with an igniter that kickstarts the combustion. Launch them have them hit and splash on a target - vaguely like a HESH round then sets the fuel, which is stuck to the target on fire Since space craft have limited capacity to dump out heat, this might actually end up being pretty nasty. It would be a complicated/rube goldbergian weapon though You could also use them as decoys or flares as needed. However, I do suspect something like this wouldn't be as effective in most cases as big, dumb, fast projectiles, except against say a space station or other stationary target. 

Extreme close quarters combat. I'd note a 'traditional' mace or axe would be a pretty terrible weapon on this situation. A Jackhammer the size of a small truck on the other hand, might be more useful in short range combat. Unlike a gun, you can power this off the same power supply as the mech itself, and it would be useful for combat engineer type work, demolishing and building fortifications and so on. After all, hitting someone in the head till they stop moving is a valid combat tactic. Likewise a high speed spinning blade might make more sense than a sword. A sword against armour might stop. A high speed blade would slice through. And similar weapons are in use in robot fighting tournaments, so you might have a 'in universe' explaination of pilots being familiar with such weapons - you'd have 'military' mechs with mainly energy and projectile weapons and 'gladiatorial' mechs that combine top notch pilots with limited armaments and physical weapons.
