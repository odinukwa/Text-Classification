If $\Sigma$ is a closed Riemann surface, a complex projective structure $Z$ on $\Sigma$ is an atlas of charts, refining the holomorphic atlas, with values in $\mathbb{CP}^{1}$ such that the transition functions are locally projective transformations in ${PSL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ acting by Mobius transformations. Associated to such a structure is a short exact sequence of sheaves \begin{align} 0\rightarrow \mathcal{P}_{Z}\rightarrow \Theta_{\Sigma}\rightarrow K_{\Sigma}^{2}\rightarrow 0 \end{align} where $\mathcal{P}_{Z}$ is the sheaf of projective vector fields (i.e. those vector fields which in a local chart for the projective structure are identified with an infinitesimal Mobius transformation), $\Theta_{\Sigma}$ is the holomorphic tangent sheaf of $\Sigma,$ and $K_{\Sigma}^{2}$ is the tensor square of the canonical sheaf. The first map is given by inclusion. In a projective coordinate, the second map takes a local holomorphic vector field $v(z)\frac{\partial}{\partial z}$ to $v'''(z) dz^{2}.$ Since projective vector fields, expressed in a projective coordinate, are exactly the quadratic vector fields, the above sequence is left exact and it's not too hard to see that the latter map is surjective. Of course, we know there is some exact sequence of the kind above without ever identifying what the quotient sheaf and quotient map are explicitly: the key here is that we can explicitly identify the quotient sheaf associated to the injection $0\rightarrow \mathcal{P}_{Z}\rightarrow \Theta_{\Sigma}$ with the square of the canonical bundle, a fact which underlies much of the structure of the space of complex projective structures on $\Sigma.$ For those that are somewhat familiar with this story, one can concisely assert that the above described map is the infinitesimal Schwarzian derivative, which explains the title of the question. I am curious is there is a uniform way to extend this picture to holomorphic $(G,X)$-structures on a given compact complex manifold $M.$ To recall, let $G$ be a complex Lie group acting transitively on a complex manifold $X.$ If $M$ is a complex manifold, a holomorphic $(G,X)$-structure on $M$ is an atlas of charts, refining the holomorphic atlas, with values in $X$ and whose transition functions are locally in $G.$ Now, let $W$ be a holomorphic $(G,X)$-manifold with underlying complex manifold $M.$ If $\mathcal{G}_{W}$ denotes the sheaf of $G$-vector fields, that is, the sheaf whose sections are vector fields which in a local $(G,X)$-chart are identified with the infinitesimal $G$-action on $X,$ then there is a short exact sequence \begin{align} 0\rightarrow \mathcal{G}_{W}\rightarrow \Theta_{M}\rightarrow Q\rightarrow 0 \end{align} where $Q$ is the corresponding quotient sheaf. $\textbf{My question is the following}:$ As with the case of projective structures on a Riemann surface, can one explicitly identify the quotient sheaf and the quotient map? For instance, is it a locally free sheaf? The kind of thing I have in mind is the following: I want there to be a differential operator acting on the Pseudo-group of locally defined biholomorphisms of $X$ whose Kernel is precisely $G,$ maybe there is some issue with $G$ not acting effectively but let's ignore that for the moment. The linearization of this operator should be an operator on holomorphic vector fields on $X$ whose kernel consists of the vector fields given by the infinitesimal $G$-action. Since the transition functions of the $(G,X)$-structure are given by elements of $G,$ this data should port over to the $(G,X)$-manifold $W$ and produce a sheaf map from $\Theta_{W}$ to some other sheaf which seems like it should be some kind of jet bundle. If one is familiar with Schwarzian derivative, this is exactly what is happening in the example of complex projective structures. I've found some things in the literature that are in this spirit, but they mostly seem quite ad-hoc, and I am really trying to understand if there is some uniform way to understand this question using the geometry of $X$ as a $G$-homogeneous space. I could go on more, but this post is already long, so please let me know if more information would be useful. As always, thank you for any help you can provide. 

I believe the bordism groups are nonzero in every dimension after some relatively small finite dimension, just by looking at the PoincarÃ© polynomial in Anderson-Brown-Peterson's earlier paper "Spin Cobordism". However, from their splitting result, all of these groups come from suspensions of Eilenberg-MacLane spectra. In particular, the image of the Hurewicz map $\Omega^{fr}_* \rightarrow \Omega^{spin}_*$ is zero in dimensions 4k-1 because that's true for connective covers of KO and nonzero suspensions of EM-spectra. Atiyah et. al. are only ever using that framed manifolds in that dimension are bounded by Spin-manifolds, so their arguments still work, despite the mistaken claim about Spin bordism groups in general. 

Pullbacks themselves are only defined up to coherent homotopy equivalence. Compositions in an infinity category (like $Cat_\infty$) are only defined up to coherent equivalence. Any two good choices of a "pullback functor" $f^*: \mathcal{C}/A \rightarrow \mathcal{C}/B$ must be equivalent. 

The intuition is supposed to be that, if $p: X \to S$ is Cartesian, $X$ is like an oplax colimit of the diagram $S^{op} \to \mathsf{Cat}_{\infty}$ (this has been made precise by Gepner-Haugseng-Nikolaus). The difference between an oplax colimit and a colimit is that some comparison morphisms are just morphisms instead of equivalences, so you fix that by inverting them. So (as is shown in different language in this section of HTT) the localization $X[\mathcal{E}^{-1}]$ is meant to model the colimit of an $S^{op}$ shaped diagram. But colimits may be computed after restricting along a final map $S^{'op} \to S^{op}$, whence the lemma. (Obviously this reasoning is circular, since the point of the section is to justify the claim that $X[\mathcal{E}^{-1}]$ models the colimit, but hopefully the lemma is more believable now.) 

This question is inspired by a recent question about holomorphic bundles and factors of automorphy. Suppose $X$ is a compact, complex manifold whose universal cover $\widetilde{X}$ is Stein (the Stein condition is just to ensure all topologically trivial holomorphic vector bundles over $\widetilde{X}$ are holomorphically trivial). Then I've just recently come to appreciate the theorem that every holomorphic vector bundle (whose pullback to $\widetilde{X}$ is topologically trivial) \begin{align} E\rightarrow X \end{align} arises from a factor of automorphy, this is a holomorphic map: \begin{align} f:\pi_1(X) \times \widetilde{X}\rightarrow GL_n(\mathbb{C}) \end{align} satisfying the cocycle condition $f(\gamma\eta, x)=f(\gamma,\eta(x))f(\eta, x).$ The map $f$ defines a $\pi_1(X)$-action on the trivial bundle $\widetilde{X}\times \mathbb{C}^n\rightarrow \widetilde{X}$ and the quotient defines a holomorphic vector bundle over $X.$ Now suppose that the holomorphic structure on $E\rightarrow X$ is given as the $(0,1)$-part of a linear connection $\nabla$ on $E.$ If this connection is flat, then the factor of automorphy is nothing more than the monodromy representation $\rho:\pi_1(X)\rightarrow GL_n(\mathbb{C})$ of this flat vector bundle. $\textbf{My question is:}$ if the connection is not flat, is there a gauge theoretic construction of the factor of automorphy defining the holomorphic structure on $E.$ Ideally this would be something involving parallel transport using the connection $\nabla,$ but in my first fumbling attempts I haven't found a way to do this. My motivation for this question arises from something that has befuddled me for some time. I won't define everything in this section but a reference for anything I say is in Hitchin's paper "The self-duality equations on a Riemann surface." Let $X$ be a compact Riemann surface of genus at least 2. Let $\rho:\pi_1(X)\rightarrow SL_2(\mathbb{R})$ be a Fuchsian representation. Then via the non-abelian Hodge correspondence, the Higgs bundles $(E,\phi)$ corresponding to any Fuchsian representation all have the same underlying holomorphic bundle, namely \begin{align} E=K^{-\frac{1}{2}}\oplus K^{\frac{1}{2}} \end{align} where $K$ is the canonical bundle over $X.$ This has always been mysterious to me, starting from the flat bundle side; namely you form the flat bundle $E_{\rho}=\widetilde{X}\times_{\rho}\mathbb{C}^2$ and let's call the flat connection $B.$ Then by Hitchin, there exists a unique unitary connection $\nabla$ such that \begin{align} B=\nabla+\psi, \end{align} and $d_{\nabla}^{*}\psi=0.$ The holomorphic structure on $E_{\rho}$ in the Higgs bundle picture is then the one induced by the $(0,1)$-part of the unitary connection $\nabla,$ which is not the same as the one induced by the flat connection $B$ on $E_{\rho}.$ But, why should this always be $K^{-\frac{1}{2}}\oplus K^{\frac{1}{2}}.$ I've never reached a satisfying answer to this issue. I wonder if some insight into the question I asked above could clarify this situation. Thank you for any help. 

Algebraic Geometry from a Homotopical Viewpoint: For the topologist who really wants to like geometry but doesn't know where to start. 

My first question is, does the following diagram commute? $\require{AMScd}$ \begin{CD} \text{Pic}(X) @>e>> H^2(X, \mathbb{Z})\\ @V \text{Nm} V V @VV \pi_! V\\ \text{Pic}(Y) @>>e> H^2(Y, \mathbb{Z}) \end{CD} where e denotes taking the Euler class of a holomorphic line bundle. I hope and believe the answer is yes, but I think what's getting in my way is my inability to find good references for the first construction and for branched covers in general. I imagine the proof would go by rewriting one or both of these transfers in terms of sheaf cohomology or Cech cohomology until they are visibly the same. Even better would be a proof that constructs a norm for topological line bundles and proceeds to prove a stronger statement purely in the world of topology. So that leads me to my second question, which I should probably know the answer to: Does the norm construction for line bundles also work topologically and, more importantly, is there a reference? 

Though I don't know of an example off-hand, I don't believe it's the case that every cellular model category presents a presentable $\infty$-category. In practice, we can usually find a combinatorial model for the homotopy theory we're interested in. On the other hand, I think it is true that if you start with a left proper, simplicial, cellular model category and localize, then you will get a localization of the corresponding $\infty$-categories. This is because of Proposition 5.2.4.6 in Higher Topos Theory, which says that a nice adjunction between simplicial model categories gives rise to an adjunction between $\infty$-categories. You can probably remove the requirement that the model categories are simplicial if you work a bit harder. 

This seems to have nothing to do with Kahler manifolds, at least not how you have stated it. Any $C^{\infty}$-complex vector bundle over a paracompact smooth manifold admits a Hermitian metric, by employing a partition of unity. The imaginary part of this Hermitian metric is a skew-symmetric, non-degenerate bilinear form on each fiber which makes that complex vector bundle into a symplectic vector bundle. 

It follows from Weil's rigidity theorem $URL$ that given any uniform lattice in $SU(n,1)$ with $n>1,$ it has no local deformations, in fact no non-trivial first order deformations. If $n=1$ then the the symmetric space is the real hyperbolic plane and there is a large family of deformations for surface groups. Now, if you don't require the lattice condition, then there may or may not be deformations. The case of a surface group is the most well understood (to me at least). It is a theorem of Toledo that a discrete surface group (here surface means closed, oriented and genus at least two) in $SU(2,1)$ which stabilizes a totally geodesic holomorphic hyperbolic plane in $\mathbb{CH}^2$ is locally rigid. But, surfaces groups which stabilize a totally real lagrangian hyperbolic plane in $\mathbb{CH}^2$ admit many deformations, these are so-called complex hyperbolic quasi-Fuchsian groups and their deformations are still far from well understood. Maybe Misha Kapovich (who posts here and is an expert) might add some more interesting comments at some point. 

I'm not completely sure if I understand the question, but I will at least try to answer the "why we do this" part. I think you're asking, "Why do we look at cycles modulo boundaries instead of just cycles?" and the answer to this is pretty simple: boundaries are uninteresting. If some $n$-cycle is the boundary of an $(n+1)$-simplex, then the boundary can be "pulled across" the simplex to no longer represent a "loop." In otherwords; boundaries don't represent true holes. We care about cycles that surround a hole, so that's why we look at cycles modulo boundaries. I'm not sure what you mean by "what is the algorithm." If you mean, "how do you compute homology?", then you can look that up in any algebraic topology book or wikipedia. 

Let me try to turn my comment into an answer. Again, the intuition is to filter $\mathrm{Ind}_{\mathbb{E}_0}^{\mathbb{E}_k}M$ by arity, and the result (at least in slightly less generality) is certainly classical, but I'll give a proof in the language you use above. I will also make the following assumptions (which hopefully you are making too): 

The category of chain complexes on a Grothendieck abelian category can be given the structure of a stable model category in which the weak equivalences are the quasi-isos. The category of chain complexes of $\mathcal{O}$-modules on any ringed space admits a symmetric monoidal model structure, which means that the unbounded derived category is at the very least a tensor-triangulated category (it's not immediately obvious that the tensor structure plays nice with the triangular structure, but it would be very strange to me if this wasn't true or obvious to someone else?) 

Is $J$ integrable? I believe that the answer to this question is likely to be no, though I am having trouble cooking up a counter-example. The only immediate consequence I see is that the Nijenhuis tensor on $M$ must take values in vertical vector fields. I am primarily interested in the case where $M$ and $N$ are not compact so standard techniques of deformation theory of compact complex manifold don't easily apply, though I don't know the answer in the case when $p$ is proper either. My google searches haven't turned up anything useful yet, so I'd be very interested to hear about any additional conditions one could add to this list, namely additional structure on $M,$ which guarantees that $J$ is integrable if, as I suspect, the answer to my original question is negative. Thanks in advance for any comments. 

For experts in the analysis of minimal surfaces I will state the question first; then I will follow up with details. Question: Does the $\varepsilon$-regularity theorem of Choi and Schoen ($URL$ for minimal surfaces in three-dimensional Riemannian manifolds extend to Riemannian manifold targets of arbitrary dimension? For non-experts, let me state the $\varepsilon$-regularity result of Choi and Schoen. Let $(M,h)$ be a three dimensional Riemannian manifold and suppose \begin{align} f: \Sigma \rightarrow M \end{align} is an immersed minimal surface; here the topology of $\Sigma$ is arbitrary. Let $(g,B)$ denote the induced metric and second fundamental form via the immersion $f.$ The following $\varepsilon$-regularity theorem posits that sufficient control on the $L^{2}$-norm of $B$ on balls of controlled size implies $L^{\infty}$-bounds on $B$ on balls of controlled size. Theorem: There exists constants $\varepsilon, \rho>0,$ (which depend only on the curvature of $M$ and it's covariant derivatives), such that if $r_{0}<\rho, \ x\in M$ and \begin{align} f(\Sigma)\cap \partial B_{r_{0}}(x)=\partial(f(\Sigma)\cap B_{r_{0}}(x)), \end{align} the following property holds. If there exists $0<\delta\leq 1$ such that \begin{align} \int_{B_{r_{0}}(x)\cap f(\Sigma)} \lVert B\rVert^{2} dV_{g}< \delta\varepsilon, \end{align} then for all $0<\sigma\leq r_{0}$ and all $y\in B_{r_{0}-\sigma}(x)\cap f(\Sigma)$, \begin{align} \sigma^{2}\lVert B\rVert^{2}(y)<\delta. \end{align} In the above theorem, $B_{r}(x)$ is the Riemannian ball of radius $r>0$ in the manifold $M$ and $dV_{g}$ is the Riemannian volume element of the metric $g$ on $\Sigma.$ Lastly, the symbol $\partial$ indicates the topological boundary of a set. My question is if the manifold $M$ can be replaced by a Riemannian manifold of arbitrary dimension. These types of regularity estimates date back to the work of Sacks-Uhlenbeck on minimal surfaces, and are an indispensable tool for the study of asymptotics to solutions of many systems of partial differential equations that have a geometric origin: examples include the Yang-Mills equations, the self-duality equations, the study of minimal surfaces, and more generally, harmonic maps. Unfortunately, for the most part I'm a casual observer to these developments and some basic google searches haven't pulled up any papers claiming this can be extended to arbitrary co-dimension. The obvious thing to do is to dive into the proof of Choi and Schoen, but before I undertake such a task, I was hoping someone here might save me the time. I appreciate any suggestions and/or references. Thank you. 

Take the formula in (1) and replace the homotopy colimit over $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ by a homotopy colimit over $\mathsf{Orth} \times \mathsf{Orth}$. To compute that homotopy colimit, we are free to first left Kan extend along $\oplus: \mathsf{Orth} \times \mathsf{Orth} \to \mathsf{Orth}$. Stare at the pointwise formula for the left Kan extension evaluated at $\mathbb{R}^n$, and you become interested in a homotopy colimit along all pairs $p+q = n$ together with actions of $O(p) \times O(q)$ etc. Now suspend everything n times, erase the $\Sigma^{\infty}$'s, and use one of the standard formulas for computing a homotopy colimit as an ordinary colimit in some model category, and you should get (with cofibrancy conditions if you want the right homotopy type) the previously mentioned formula in the linked book. 

As far as I can tell, the idea to use filtered categories instead of just ordinal-indexed diagrams is due to Grothendieck. In fact, let me use this opportunity to advertise my favorite text on abstract category theory: ExposÃ© I of SGA 4. It rocks. Anyway: Proposition 8.1.6 (loc. cit.), which Grothendieck attributes to Deligne, says that every filtered category receives a cofinal map from an ordered set. Grothendieck remarks that, while this result says that the two points of view on filtered objects (general or ordered) are essentially equivalent, filtered objects arise more naturally. A nice example is Grothendieck's Theorem 8.3.3 on ind-representability. Aside from some set-theoretic issues, this basically boils down to the statement that exactness of a presheaf of sets $F$ on a category $C$ is equivalent to the category $C_{/F}$ being filtered. 

In this setting, the "natural" thing to do is to pull-back your metric of choice on the base $M,$ obtaining a metric on $\hat{M}$ which will have singularities (i.e. failure of positive definiteness) along the branching locus. On the complement of these singularities the covering projection is (by definition) a local isometry, and thus curvature properties of the base metric will remain on that part of $\hat{M}.$ In the case of Riemann surfaces presented as branched covers over $\mathbb{CP}^1,$ these pulled back "metrics" will have conical singularities at the ramification points of the covering map. I don't know the history at all, but I would be interested to know if the original interest in metrics with conical singularities arose from these examples; it seems feasible. 

The bundle $P$ is obtained by reducing the structure group of the $SO(n,\mathbb{C})$ bundle $P^c$ to the maximal compact subgroup $SO(n).$ Let's call the inclusion \begin{align} i: P\rightarrow P^c. \end{align} Pulling back the connection form gives $i^{*}(\omega^c)\in \Omega^1(P,\mathfrak{so}_n(\mathbb{C})).$ The Lie algebra of $SO(n,\mathbb{C})$ admits an invariant (with respect to the Adjoint action of $SO(n)$) splitting, \begin{align} \mathfrak{so}_n(\mathbb{C})=\mathfrak{so}(n)\oplus i\mathfrak{so}(n). \end{align} Decomposing the pull-back into these pieces gives, \begin{align} i^{*}\omega^c=\omega + \phi. \end{align} Then, $\omega$ is a connection on $P$ and $\phi$ descends to the base taking values in the adjoint bundle, \begin{align} P\times_{Ad(SO(n))} i\mathfrak{so}(n)=i\ \text{ad}(P). \end{align} That is to say, $\phi\in \Omega^1(M,i\ \text{ad}(P)).$ If the original connection is flat, then the pair $(\omega,\phi)$ satisfy some equations: \begin{align} F(\omega)+\frac{1}{2}[\phi,\phi]=0 \\ d^{\omega}\phi=0. \end{align} Here, $F(\omega)$ is the curvature of $\omega,$ the bracket operation combines the wedge product of forms and the Lie bracket, hence is symmetric so that the term $[\phi,\phi]$ does not (necessarily) vanish. The operator $d^{\omega}$ is the exterior covariant derivative operator associated to the connection $\omega.$ Notice that the first equation is of two forms with values in $ad(P)$ and the latter is of two forms with values in $i\ ad(P).$ The first equation is one of a pair of equations known as Hitchin's self-duality equations. You can read all about them (in the case of $SO(3,\mathbb{C})$) in the original beautiful paper of Hitchin: $URL$
