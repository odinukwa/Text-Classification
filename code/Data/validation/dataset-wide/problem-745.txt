I heard an interesting opinion yesterday that said all freewheels made back in the day (we were discussing this over a wheel with a Maillard hub and a Maeda (?) freewheel). The shop mechanic said that because it was made in the hey-day of freewheels, it was automatically better than anything made today, in which everything freewheel is being slowly phased out. Now I've tried out mountain/hybrid bike freewheels on a road bike, and I liked the ramps and such, but do the older freewheels (especially entry-mid level ones) really hold that much over modern freewheels? This may sound a little opinion based, but I'm know there's a factual answer out there comparing weight, usability, durability, features, and other technical attributes which make a difference to general, everyday performance. Also, I'm strictly comparing members of the thread-on class, not discussing the merits of cassettes and free-hubs and other modern technology. I tend to run a lot of older technology by virtue of it being cheaper to pick up and cheaper to replace when my daily is stolen and cheaper to maintain myself. 

I'm wondering if there are any advantages to mounting ones water-bottle on the bottom of the down tube, near the ground, versus on top of the tube. I'm mainly interested in the advantages, or lack thereof, in the context of a road riding. It seems like if you are riding a mountain bike or riding off-road, it could protect your frame from stumps, branches, or anything else that you could land on that is taller than the bottom of your down tube. Also, I could see it helping to keep the center of gravity of the bike as low as possible, for mountain and road. Are there any other advantages to mounting a bottle on the bottom of the down tube on a road bike? 

You should take it to your local bike shop and get the wheel dished and trued. It is probably a mix of both those issues. Depending on how bad it is you may need to replace the wheel entirely. 

I'm considering getting a bike for my friend; she is interested in riding road/gravel with me, doesn't own a bike of her own, and doesn't know too much about what's available. She is about 5 feet tall (1.5 meters) and 100 pounds (45 kilos). I believe a 47-49cm frame would be a good fit for her. Considering her small stature and the small frame size I was thinking about a set of 650b wheels. It seems there has been a trend of 650b fitted bikes recently and that the wheel size is slowly creeping back into the market. One of the advantages is that one can fit a wider, taller tire without worrying about clearance or modifying frame geometry. I got to thinking that outfitting her with a 650b wheel set might be a viable option with some advantages over a 700c wheel set. My question is what are the advantages and disadvantages of fitting a petite rider with a 650b wheel set, in comparison to a 700c set. I'm especially interested in bike handling, tire fitting, and frame geometry implications and considerations. 

I have found before that if you decide to do the quick release up tighter than usual it can tighten up the bearings a little too much and you might hear a fairly regular noise as the wheel rotates. I'm not sure I would call it a 'scratching' noise, but maybe that's it. Try a looser quick release adjustment. If the noise remains the same then you can rule this idea out. 

I'm setting up some Avid BB5s. As I tried to bed in the brakes, the front one squeals quite heavily, the back does not. The following image is of the non-drive side of the front disc rotor. (Where the outboard pad hits.) 

I've got a cheap new rear wheel. Disassembled the cones etc and replaced with my own grease. When trying to adjust the bearings to the correct tension, it gets to a point where the axle will make small movements smoothly, but will suddenly give a lot of resistance. If i turn the axle (not the cone), back to where it was smooth, there is still play in the axle, suggesting the axle should be rotating smoothly the entire 360 degrees. When I remove the cones, I usually see that one of the bearings has 'jumped' out of its position and on top of one of the others. What could be causing this? It's new so there's no pitting or corrosion. I think I used an acceptable amount of grease and there are 9 bearings each side. 

You should not be able to. Generally you want your leg fully extended and your foot parallel to the ground at the bottom of your stroke. As others have mentioned, there are allowances to that rule to increase maneuverability, which comes with having a lower saddle, but if you can touch the ground flat footed, and your pedal is 15-30 cm off the ground at the bottom of your stroke, then you can't possibly have an efficient stroke, and you're hurting your knees in the process. One of the strategies to adjusting your saddle is that you ride for about 5 minutes, then raise your saddle about an inch. According to Sheldon Brown, if your bike feels lighter and faster, then that's a good adjustment for you. I raise it by inch or half inch increments, then when it feels like you're over reaching, lower it by only a quarter inch at a time. Give yourself time to adjust. 

This question has been nagging me for ages. I've read a lot of Sheldon Brown's site and actually tend to use bikes from the 70s-80s because they're more economical for daily use and especially for a student like me. But I've noticed that some of his opinions can be controversial (his discussion of "lawyer lips"), can fly in the face of industry practices (that all leather saddles, 'properly cared for', are better than any plastic saddle), questionable (that the Peugeot UO-8 makes for the greatest touring bike of all time) and then, sometimes, his opinions seem on a troll level, which I can't think of any examples off the top of my head, but have caught myself falling prey to them. A lot of his material is either very enlightening (his discussion of brake usage) or helpful in that you simply can't find the topic anywhere else on the web. So the question is, is Sheldon Brown's site really the one-stop for all knowledge pertaining especially to older bicycles, or should he be taken simply as a prolific writer who wrote on a great many topics and should be taken with a large grain of salt? I guess the real question is, how much do bike mechanics especially and others depend on his work, or is it simply a convenient online resource for people new to the sport? 

About me - I live in downtown Chicago and have been riding seriously in the city for 10 plus years, for most of the year, multiple days per week. For the last 2 years, I have been walking to and fro work each morning mostly down upper Wacker for the bulk of the way. I come home for lunch on the same route, and then back to the office in River North. I keenly observe the riders every day, which range from professional curriers to daily commuters, to tourists and divvy riders. I ride in the area myself. Michigan and Illinois is north of the river, lower Wacker runs south of the river and doesn't cross to Michigan and Illinois, but will hit lower Michigan (which is somewhat similar to lower Wacker) and that can be taken to Illinois. So I will assume the journey you are talking about is just most of lower Wacker. I'm going to play devil's advocate and say that if you feel confident with the route, the traffic patterns, and are a fairly strong rider, then go for it! Make sure to use bright lights on your bike, reflective clothing, etc. People ride upper Wacker every day, people that probably shouldn't even be riding downtown. There isn't that much difference between upper and lower except that there is much less natural daylight. Everything the others have said about lower Wacker is valid (mostly), but the same can be said about upper Wacker and it's ridden heavily. Personally, I don't ride upper or lower Wacker - except on Saturday and Sunday mornings when CTA busses are not running as often and traffic is generally clam. By noon this calm subsides and I'm off of Wacker. I can guess the general area where you live or are starting your ride from and based on your destination, going through lower Wacker to lower Michigan might be the route that offers you the most cover from the elements, is the most direct, and will have the least traffic lights. So, while it might feel more dangerous, I hesitate to say it is. There is a "tent city" that has started under lower Wacker and by the river walk, with homeless people living there, but I don't fear them or worry about being attacked during a ride. To reiterate, lower Wacker wouldn't be my choice, but if I were riding your route, I might consider it after some practice on the weekends. One more thing - if you do start riding lower Wacker, or upper Wacker for that matter - take the whole lane. Don't try to share it with a car. People might get mad but that's not your problem. Better to let them slow down and pass in the left lane then get sideswiped or surprised by someone who is too close for comfort. 

The following image is of the drive side of the front disc rotor (where the rotor is pressed into the inboard pad.) 

Notice the marks where the pad material has transferred onto the rotor in each picture. The marks end further inward toward the centre of the disk on the outboard pad side, than on the side where the inboard pad hits it. Because of the way the brake works (bending the rotor at an angle as it is pushed into the stationary inboard pad), this would make sense to me as the very top of the rotor hits the inboard pad, and because of the angle, leaves a gap lower down. But is this how BB5s are supposed to be? I say this because the while a similar thing is happening on the rear rotor, it is not quite as pronounced (ie, the inboard pad side seems to be hitting a smidge more square on, and does not squeal). I have played around with different pad adjustments as well as caliper alignment. I've tried the sanding the rotor and pads trick. And it's new so nothing is contaminated and I've used alcohol on everything just to be sure. Nothing seems to make any difference either with trying to bring the position of the inboard pad lower as it makes contact, or the squealing itself. I took it to my LBS, he seems to think it's an acceptable set up and just needs riding, but did not say why the rear seems to be acting differently to the front, despite setting them up in the same way multiple times. Could it be a slight manufacturing defect on the front one that causes the inboard pad to sit at a slight angle (it's not totally clear with the naked eye).
