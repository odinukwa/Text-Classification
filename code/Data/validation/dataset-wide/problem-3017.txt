Can a point divide two lines? Yes. Now to the question of belonging posed by Luke in his fourth sentence. If we were to snap the lines into four at this point of intersection, must we dicide which end to stick the point onto? No, and I am unanimous in this. Whence "belonging"? The point is gone, there is no longer any position to mark. All the point ever was was a position at the intersection of two lines, each line is just length. There is never any sense of a point belonging at all. A point has position only. The geometers say we can only describe the point, line and surface; let no one say we define them. That's what they say. All "blessings" flow from this trinity, which begin the process of definition and underlie the definitions of all other geometric terms. 

I do not comprehend the distinction in the bolded (subordinate) clause. To me, the bolded seems only to use different words to describe the same error; ie: how can you distort an argument without changing the subject, and vice versa? What have I neglected?

The razor hasn't been appropriately deployed here. Where you say "simpler one" you really mean that the razor would have you pick between hypotheses A and B in virtue of the number of explanatory posits they individually put forth. Specifically, if there are more explanatory posits in A than in B, and A and B both satisfactorily explain all of the relevant observations, then B is simpler than A. 

Here you've given some great examples of when to use Ockham's Razor because you've invoked explanatory posits that unduly complicate a reasonable analysis of the applicability of Ockham's Razor. Questioning Ockham's Razor means questioning the role of theoretical simplicity and the number of proffered explanatory posits. The only problems you bring up with the razor are borne of "credence distributions." What exactly are credence distributions? No matter what your answer is, they will also be explanatory posits of your theory. By definition, more explanatory posits makes your theory more complicated. In principle there's no reason you can't bring new explanatory posits into a theory, but as the Ockham's Razor wikipedia article says, they must offer some explanatory power. Including "credence distributions" in your theory doesn't seem to explain any more than a theory without them, and in fact seems to create problems where there were none.

Why should the red y instead be x (per the above answer)? I wrote the red y because the green restrictive relative clause modifies bison2, and not bison1.

But how does the green argument logically equal the red? One problem is the arguments' difference in conclusions: 3 does not equal 6. 

I think Joseph Weissman has already given one possible answer, Nietzsche. If the only Christian died on the cross, where does that leave Christianity? As myth. And not just as a Christian myth, but as already parasitical of Greek myth. Jesus is clearly acting out the part of Dionysus. The plot-scheme of the four Gospels is soaked in wine, and Jesus himself is connected with wine over and over again. Jesus acts out other parts as well (see Isaiah). Nietzsche says God is dead, but for Nietzsche there was never a real God, the myth of God was dead. But maybe Nietzsche was too pessimistic and he didn't take into account mankind's love of a good story, but that can't be right, because he proceeded to write his own stories, his own myth! We are dealing with myths inside of myths as the new religions dig into the past for material. Look at some of the New Age stuff. But the real possibilities of these myths (some may say stories) are in filmmaking now. Surely there will be a New Age Batman , but only after there is a Christian superhero film first. Maybe there has already been one. "Jesus Christ Superstar", (1973)? Broadly speaking, it appears that in our history we have gone from having religions, to having myths, to having mere stories. But the relationship between religion and myth seems very complicated to me. I have read that the region of Mesopotamia was where many religions got their start. As far as religion and myth go, they seem to exist in a circular relationship with each other. First the religion comes, then it dies or fades out, and the religion then fades into myth. The myth then becomes a source of themes and material for the making of the next religion. It's also possible for one religion to spawn another one, and Judaism has been a rich source of material in this regard. It seems that mankind needs some sort of larger-than-life narrative to keep himself going. Over the long stretch of history, we have become thoroughly desacralized and demythologized as we have begun to "see through" the religion-myth circular interaction. We have become jaded, but we still crave the narrative. Nietzsche himself has become a source of "new"myth,Overman, Zarathustra, which is no great surprise as he had been a professor of classics, or philology, at Bern. And who is Zarathustra but Zoroaster!? Is there anything new under the sun? Nietzsche, who supposedly wiped away metaphysics, and religion-myth created his own text or myth as a lense through which to see our world. This is the text as Derrida described it: our approach to the world is through a grand text. A massive piece of art. But isn't this text, that tells us how "to be" just a new metaphysics? Because the largest part of a metaphysics is its ontological scheme.

At first I didn't understand why you tacked that question onto the end about the pleasure principle, I thought your question would surely be about Freud's Oedipus complex. Then I began to see you have in all likelihood asked a more advanced question. My Freud is rusty, but I will try to give you an answer, such as it is. No they were not able to fully express the Id (the Id is driven by the pleasure principle) in an instinctive, guilt-free way. As you show in your facts, they experienced guilt over their acts (super ego). This guilt was the impetus for the creation of religion, according to Freud. Now if Freud mentions superego, then it seems to me that the ego would have been formed as well by this time, and therefore the sons would surely have some "reasonable" rationalization for their killing of their father. Where there is Id, there will be ego. Where there is Id, ego will come along to repress it, rationalize it, and to sublimate it by creating art, and by doing other creative and productive things to constructively discharge sexual tension. (If you have ever felt a strong sexual urge while sitting among people at church, temple etc. you may get some idea of this in action. This urge is usually repressed and converted on the spot to warm fuzzy feelings, and to praying and worshiping all the harder!) Civilization here is in formation (Totem & Taboo) and never again will man be able to fully discharge sex and aggression free of guilt and repression, rationalization (and "constructive" sublimation by those who can turn sex urges into art or into creation of other projects) though frankly, as it so happens in our history, the richer and more powerful people are able to "get away" with certain types of sexual hanky panky, and even aggression, that the rest of us would surely suffer for. But still, society, civilization imposes limits even on the rich and powerful, unless for some reason there is a breakdown in civilization. If you want to get an idea of a possible alternative that would allow people a more fully expressed libido, but still under civilization, then you may want to read "Eros and Civilization" by Herbert Marcuse. It's available PDF on the internet in two parts. It's not a great copy, but it is readable. The book really is a sort of bookend to Freud's "Civilization and it's Discontents". Many would consider Marcuse's book to be dated now, but I still think it's an interesting read. To understand Marcuse's book it is necessary to have a good grip on Freud's Oedipus "complex", and this can be found in an encyclopedia or dictionary of psychology ...the good ones like you find in the reference section of a good library would be my choice; there is also Wikipedia. And the perpetual cycle you speak of would be Freud's Oedipus complex. I assume you are getting your material form Totem and Taboo. 

The original didn't number the Conditional Statements. Which of the 4 statements did the author intend by "at least"? Is sentence 2 the referent of "unless"?

I seek only intuition; please do not answer with formal proofs or Truth Tables. How can I understand 'unless' = 'or' directly and intuitively, without relying on the secondary definition that 'unless' = 'if not'? My problem is my overcomplicated present understanding of 'unless': first I must remember 'unless' = 'if not', and then remember 'if not' = 'or' (which can be proven by comparing the Truth Tables for ~A => B and A ˅ B). 

I have erased some of my over-the-top comments and I am writing a short answer really to put Barinder's question back on top again because it was a good question. My feeling is that Nietzsche is writing an anti-philosophy, and that he would suggest that we humans operate on the level of the instincts. The only check on this would be the true ascetic aristocratic mode of being. The true aristocrat was after land and he was a warrior, not a thinker. Rarely will you find an aristocrat and a thinker in one person, though Descartes had the misfortune of running across one with a very cold library. Aristocrats fight for what they want, and they satisfy their instinctual urges without any qualms, but this requires a warrior spirit and this requires a fit body, and this may require a somewhat asetic life. We philosophers (who know our Nietzsche) are called to give up our thinking, and our word play to to become this kind of "philosopher-aristocrat", if you will. This is very much Nietzsche's version of the philosopher king, not Plato's. The second point would be on Descartes' "I", and whether perhaps Nietzsche had studied some Buddhism (idea from Schopenhauer?), and that Nietzsche began to question the idea of the "I" in Descartes (i.e. Buddha would say no "I", no ego, it is not to be found). At any rate, if Buddhism worked to calm Schopenhauer's Will, it would actually defeat Nietzsche's larger project of turning man into an instinctual doer, with the only possible check against the gross display of instinct being the temperament of the true aristocrat (the ascetic, warrior temperament, not a life of luxury and gluttony). Of course, Nietzsche could not actually "insist" on anything it seems to me, at bottom, his philosophy or anti-philosophy says all facts are interpretations, and this is itself an interpretation...so this is doing, instincts and not thinking, with all the problems and benefits that come along with doing and not thinking. 

This is the case because Rand offered very few philosophical arguments. I actually do not know of any particular arguments she did offer, but I will assume that she at least attempted to offer some. 

Ockham's Razor is a maxim. Maxims are succinct principles or rules that are used to guide actions. The razor guides us to prefer the theory (or theories) that posit(s) the least total number of entities while satisfactorily explaining the phenomena in question over theories that explain the same phenomenon but posit more entities. As the razor's Wikipedia article says: 

I'm going to try not to step on any toes here. No matter how you slice it, the content of your belief is almost undoubtedly not the "resulting distribution" of a "credence-distribution over the two hypotheses." It's easy to see why it can't be: when someone asks you if you believe A or B, your answer will never be "the resulting distribution of a credence-distribution over the two hypotheses." That may describe how you came to hold the belief you hold, but that process is not the content of that belief.
