Right from the start in the 1450's the Gutenberg printing press was used to influence people. Not only was the Bible printed but indulgences were printed out in considerable numbers as well. Classical writings, such as Greek philosophers, were also distributed. Within 10 years of the invention of the printing press, it was being used to deliver religious and political messages in books to the educated population. Perhaps the biggest early societal impact of printing was the Reformation. For example, over 300K of Martin Luther's tracts were printed and distributed between 1518-1520. It was the kind of information explosion and democratization of knowledge that wasn't seen again until the 1990's and the Internet. 

It is a politically charged issue and it really depends on the economic and political side of the fence you're on (T.E.D gave the Keynesian view). As someone who's libertarian on most financial/economic policies, I see it as detrimental and that we're still feeling the negative effects of it today. As Alan Greenspan put it in Gold and Economic Freedom... 

Judges were, by law, given less discretion in handing out sentences. This came about for two reasons. First, some sought fair application of the law. They didn't want to see one person getting off with probation while another got 10 years, particularly when this difference seemed to be based on race. Other politicians didn't want to be seen as being "soft on crime" or wanted to be seen as "tough on crime". Therefore, mandatory sentencing laws were passed that killed a lot of judicial discretion that was the case previously. Then, instead of cutting back on regulation, politicians chose to criminalize just about everything (see 3 Felonies a Day to see how this works). This allowed for harassment of political opponents, stifling of dissent and generally controlling the population. This, coupled with the curtailment of judicial discretion has led to the situation we have today, where intent doesn't matter as much. 

Here are some methods that were used throughout history to fight infection. Australian Aborigines discovered that eucalyptus and tea tree bark and leaves could ease certain infections. Other aboriginal societies used local herbs to help ease the symptoms of infection. This was typically tribal knowledge passed down through generations of healers. As documented in the Bible, ancient Hebrews used isolation of infected persons, behavioral laws and such to limit exposure to pathogens in the general population. Divine inspiration or borrowing ideas from other, nearby, societies such as the Sumerians and Egyptians, you decide. In India and China, herbal medicines were used to relieve infections. Often these were toxic compounds that contain potent alkaloids and heavy metals. Some would work against some infections, provided that they didn't kill the patient as well. Others weren't effective at all beyond a placebo effect. Some of these are still used today in traditional Chinese medicine. The Romans had a herbal "wonder drug" called Silphium that seemed to help with many infections as well as being an abortifacient. The plant that produced it was driven into extinction. Romans also used vinegar and alcohols to disinfect wounds. Other herbal concoctions were around as well with varied effectiveness. In the middle ages in Europe, medicine took a step back with leeching and other 'cures' related to superstitions, most notably humours. Also, herbal remedies from Roman times were still around to some extent. Islamic doctors combined what they learned from the Greek and Roman traditions with ideas learned from India. These were also herbal remedies, some based on Afghan opium, and heavy metals, such as mercuric chloride. At one point, they probably had the most advanced medical treatment available in the world but then a lot of this knowledge was lost after the Islamic Golden Age. Right around your cutoff date of 1700, quinine was brought from Peru to Europe. It was effective in treating malaria and some other ailments to some degree. Treatment with toxic alkaloids and heavy metals continued up until the early 20th century when antibiotics were discovered. 

Basically, the other side of the argument is that FDR did not need to use this tactic to combat currency speculation or deflation. There were enough gold reserves to have maintained the value of the dollar sufficiently but not enough to do this and finance social welfare schemes like the NRA and so forth. Therefore, I would tie the policy of abandoning the gold standard or a hybrid commodity system to the debt crisis that we're currently facing in the US and Europe. This video by Milton Friedman on the gold standard discusses it further. If you really want to get into all the details, visit FreeToChoose.tv. I'd also say that gold confiscation restricted personal economic freedom which is another thing that I see as detrimental although those of other political views do not. As I noted, it is something that's politically charged and if you're discussing it in most academic environments you'll want to stick with the Keynesian view in class discussions and papers to protect your grades (I'm probably risking down votes here for mentioning these views here). However, it's important that you know that there's more than one school of thought on this issue. 

There was considerable political opposition to the US becoming involved in European affairs again. Perhaps the most influential of these was Charles Lindbergh and the America First organization he was affiliated with. When you read through his speeches and other non-interventionist, you'll see that their main focus was on Europe. These groups fell silent for the most part after the German declaration of war against the US following Pearl Harbor. There was less concern about Japan in the general public. For the most part, up until Pearl Harbor, people didn't think an Asian power would pose a threat. They considered the aggressive, yet diplomatic, moves to be sufficient to curb Japanese aggression in Asia. It wasn't seen as a prelude to war as much as things like Lend-Lease and proposed arms sales to Britain were. 

First of all, there was a period of dictatorship in India, Indian Emergency of 26 June 1975 – 21 March 1977 and, after that, there was a minor civil war with the Sikh minority. There was also considerable religious unrest during the formation of the nation. So, I wouldn't say that Indian culture precludes these political activities. I would say that one major reason was the nature of the world during the bulk of India's history, namely, the Cold War and India's strategic location. It was in the interest of both the US and USSR to have a stable government in India where neither side had an upper hand. Therefore, there were no significant outside influences pushing for radical changes as there was in China and other countries. Another factor was that India was underdeveloped and there was a great desire to see economic improvement. Having a stable, mostly democratic, government with good rule of law and protection of property rights is the best way to achieve this goal. India's leadership knew this and, but for a few exceptions brought on by typical human failings as I noted above, they've headed in this direction. 

It seems that she is a stereotypical fictional character, mainly a female sorcerer or goddess, based on early Celtic and Welsh mythology, poems and legends. The character isn't based around any particular person from what I understand. You can find more info about the character here: Morgan le Fay 

The above principles expressed the general thoughts of the movement. The attack on Pearl Harbor shattered the first 2 points, weakened the 3rd and made the last one moot. Before that attack followed by the German declaration of war, with the memory of WWI and its aftermath still fresh in the minds of middle age and older Americans, many did not want to become entangled in what they saw as another European war. Most were concerned about the rise of Germany as a power in Europe again although there was much division about the way to deal with it. Lindbergh's idea of "impregnable defense" competed with FDR's limited interventionism. Polling data from the era isn't as accurate as today's polls but they indicated that about 2/3's of the public supported FDR's policies but that America First was gaining support quickly in some regions of the country, enough that the 1942 mid-terms could have caused a switch in opinions in Congress. 

First of all, there is an attempt by some current historians to use cultural/moral relativism when it comes to Europeans and Mesoamerican cultures in this time period. They'll attempt to equate things like the Spanish Inquisition (if they're on the anti-religious political left) or modern day abortion (if they're on the religious political right) with the human sacrifice practiced by the Aztecs. This "noble savage" or "romantic racism" train of thought attempts to obscure and downplay the brutality found in certain, non-European, cultures, such as the Aztecs. Some of this romanticization and obfuscation was in reaction to earlier historians who regarded Aztecs as uncivilized savages, which was also false. The Aztecs were both quite civilized and quite brutal. The truth of the matter is that the Aztecs weren't rivaled in the deliberate wholesale killing of civilians until the 20th century by the Nazis. While there is some debate over the scope, even the low estimates far outstrip what the Europeans or Asians ever did during the same time periods. Culturally, it was a culture of fear, the common result of an authoritarianism. The common people lived in constant fear that they would be next up upon the pyramid of death. They could be whipped up into a bloodthirsty frenzy being motivated by self-preservation and group psychological dynamics. So, yes, the Aztecs were a violent society. While individually, the everyday people were probably just typical people for the most part, as a group, they are easily one of the most internally violent and bloodthirsty cultures to have ever existed beyond the tribal level. 

My suggestion is to read what Nassim Nicholas Taleb has to say about Black Swan events and fragility. The idea expressed in the video you mentioned is an example of this. As empires get larger, they usually become more fragile and thus vulnerable to the "Black Swan" while smaller, simpler, units typically are less vulnerable to these unexpected events. Taleb notes that there are ways to avoid fragility, in business and government. He also thinks that our system is on the edge of collapse. You can take his ideas and see how they apply when a complex society fails. As T.E.D. noted, the reasons for a collapse and the results are usually quite different on the surface. However, when you start examining these events, you'll find some kind of fragility was at the core. 

Initially, after WWI and into the 1920's, it was basically a two party representative democracy under the Meiji constitution. Voting rights were limited but suffrage improved in the 1920's. As unrest grew, including assassinations and attempted assassinations, the military assumed more and more control, eventually leading to militarized statism (aka fascism or national socialism) by the 1930's. Unlike Germany and Italy, the statism wasn't focused around a particular individual but around the military leadership as a whole. For more see Taishō Period and Japanese Militarism 

The infantry sets their spears, meaning bracing them against the ground, to present a barrier to the charging horsemen. The long spears, also known as pikes, when held in a tight formation provided a spiked wall that would challenge mounted opponents. Some horses would balk when encountering the pikes while others would be impaled. The goal was to unhorse the rider and have infantry men kill the stunned riders with clubs and/or short swords. This tactic was particularly effective the battles of Stirling Bridge (1297) and Bannockburn (1314) where Scottish pikemen defeated heavy English cavalry. In both battles, using the spear walls in an area where cavalry movement was limited was a force multiplier. Other battles, such as Agincourt (1415), Crécy (1346) and Poitiers (1356), combined the spear wall tactic with missile weapons along with terrain advantages to win decisively. Cavalry counter tactics were to flank such formations and get behind them rather than to charge head on. That's why terrain played a big role. In situations where pikemen didn't have the terrain on their side, they were a lot more likely to be flanked and routed. Of course, it took a while for traditionalist knights not to charge head-on into disaster. 

The biggest reason for the decline was the Mongol invasion. The Siege of Baghdad in 1258 effectively ended the 500 year old Caliphate. Many people were killed outright, estimated around 2 million, plus the entire area was laid to waste, notably destroying the irrigation and canal system, causing continuing hardship. 

Brown overturned Plessy v. Ferguson (1896) which established the legal precedent for "separate but equal". The NAACP brought suit in 5 cases (Briggs v. Elliott, Davis v. County School Board of Prince Edward County, Gebhart v. Belton and Bolling v. Sharpe) that were combined with Brown to be heard in the Supreme Court. Prior to Brown, segregation cases tended to be dismissed in lower Federal courts on the basis of Plessy v. Ferguson. For example, there had been 11 other suits in Kansas before Brown that had been dismissed or lost. Some cases did get to the Supreme Court though. Lum v. Rice (1927) held that the exclusion on account of race of a child of Chinese ancestry didn't violate equal protection. Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada (1938) and Sipuel v. Board of Regents of Univ. of Okla. (1948), while upholding Plessy, said that if a state did not provide a equal educational facility a minority student the student must be admitted to the whites only school.

This legendary self-sufficiency isn't quite as it seems. From Colonial days, almshouses (aka poor houses) and orphanages were around to look after those with no family although this tended to be uneven in application and quality of care. While many of these were affiliated with a church, some were operated by state and local governments. People also received a lot of charitable help from friends and neighbors during rough times. Since people were generally less mobile until the 20th century, they tended to form stronger communities, often centered around a church. Even with urbanization, church groups remained an important part of charity from the various Catholic relief agencies to the Salvation Army. The transition away from religious and other community based organizations toward direct government involvement in providing assistance really began in the late 1800's Progressive movement. Reformers, such as Jane Addams and Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell, wanted to see more government involvement in the care of the poor, indigent and immigrants. They and their recommendations gained support of Progressive candidates such as Teddy Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson and Robert La Follette, Sr. Some programs got enacted at the Federal level, like the Sheppard–Towner Maternity and Infancy Protection Act in 1921. However, most programs remained at the state/local until FDR and the Great Depression. So, to get back around to your question, the change came primarily from early Progressives who, depending on your point of view, wanted to help the poor and immigrants or who wanted to exploit them to gain political power through buying their votes. 

The Vichy French Gendarmerie was set at 60,000 men by the armistice agreement and following orders by the occupying Germans. Local police retained their normal duties although they were subject to German orders. They were not allowed to retain heavy military weaponry or motorized transport. They were also compelled to work with German occupiers. If the Germans demanded someone be arrested, they would arrest them or take other actions (an example of this was seen in the film Casablanca). They were also tasked with registering and rounding up "undesirable" persons such as Jews, Gypsies and homosexuals. Politically northern and Atlantic coastal France was under the control of the Germans. Some local government activities continued in these areas but these were under tight German control. Local officials who didn't cooperate fully were typically removed from office and detained, sometimes even executed. Southern France, while not under total control, still had to tow the line with the German occupation. While there were some "elections" these were essentially rubber stamping people who had already been selected by others in power.
