EDIT: As Angelo mentions, the argument below has a problem in the case of non-reduced curves. I am not sure that an upper bound for the arithmetic genus is impossible to show, but certainly the lower bound for Cohen-Macaulay curves is false, as Angelo's examples show. The argument below shows that there is an upper bound (and in fact there is also a lower bound) for the arithmetic genus of a reduced subscheme of pure dimension one in projective space, whether Cohen-Macaulay or not. I tried to play a little with the Cohen-Macaulay condition to prove that there is an upper bound, but with little success. Choose an embedding of X in projective space. Since your curves are all in the same homology class, they all have the same degree: this is simply the intersection number of the ample class with the homology class of the curves. Generic projection to a plane tells you (since the curves are reduced) that the curves you are interested in are partial normalizations of plane curves with bounded degree. Since the arithmetic genus decreases under (partial) normalizations, and since the arithmetic genus of a plane curve of bounded degree is bounded above, you conclude that the arithmetic genera of your curves are bounded above. 

If you can check that the curve is geometrically irreducible, then you may try using the Hurwitz formula (you may use the formula in any case, but you would have to be more careful with the conclusions if the curve is not irreducible). Assuming that your example is geometrically integral, projection onto one of the axis is a morphism of degree 23. If you know that the morphism ramifies in at least 2*23+h smooth points, then the curve has genus at least 1+h/2. If you know the multiplicities of the ramification or if you know the behaviour of ramification at the singular points, then you can deduce more accurate information. EDIT: here is an expanded, more computational, version. Write an equation f defining your curve C as a polynomial of degree d in y whose coefficients are polynomials in x. Thus the morphism $(x,y) \to x$ is a morphism of degree d to $\mathbb{A}^1$. We know that this induces a finite morphism from a smooth projective model C' of C to $\mathbb{P}^1$ and we use the Hurwitz formula to compute the (arithmetic) genus g of C': $2g-2=-2d+r$, where r is the degree of the ramification divisor. The better you can estimate r from below, the better the approximation to the geometric genus of C. Clearly, the points where f=df/dy=0 but $df/dx \neq 0$ are smooth points of C that are ramified for the projection to $\mathbb{A}^1$ and hence contribute to the Hurwitz formula (ramification occurs in C' since such points are smooth and hence C and C' are locally isomorphic here). Computationally we find the resultant in y of (f,df/dy) (thus you get a polynomial in x) and purge out of it the roots it has in common with the resultant in y of (df/dx,df,dy). Denote this final polynomial by R; the number of distinct roots of R is a lower bound for r. If you are more careful, you might do a little better than this without having to worry about the singular points of C, but for "generic" projections this is optimal. It seems to me that all this requires is the ability to compute resultants of polynomials in two variables of relatively small degree as well as factoring polynomials in a single variable (and computing gcd's and quotients of polynomials in one variable). This can further be improved to a better and better lower bound by analyzing more carefully the structure of the ramification at the singular points of C and what happens at infinity: some of the points that we threw out could in fact contribute to the arithmetic genus of C', and there could be ramification "at infinity". I leave this as an exercise! 

As I commented above, if you do not impose the condition that the fiber $F$ be connected, it might be difficult to answer the question. On the other hand, there is something that you can use assuming that you have a fibre bundle, but that you cannot use in the case of just a fibration: Euler characteristics are defined and the Euler characteristic of the $M$ is the product of the Euler characteristics of $F$ and $B$. Admittedly, this uses less than the full strength of a fibre bundle, but with this observation, we can resolve the case $M=S^4$! Slightly more generally, the fact that the cohomology ring has finitely many degrees, each of which is a finitely generated abelian group, might be helpful. Suppose that $S^4$ is a non-trivial fibre bundle, with connected fiber and positive dimensional base and fiber. First of all, note that one-dimensional manifolds are circles and have vanishing Euler characteristic, so that neither the base, nor the fiber of the fibration can have dimension one. We are left with base and fiber of dimension two. Since $S^4$ is simply connected, also the base $B$ is simply connected. In particular, the Euler characteristic of the base is even (by Poincare' duality and skewness of pairing; note that the base is $S^2$, if you want to use the classification). Therefore the fiber has Euler characteristic $\pm 1$. In particular, the fiber cannot be simply connected. But then, from the long exact sequence of homotopy groups we find that either $\pi_2(S^4)$ or $\pi_1(S^4)$ are non-trivial. Since we know that this is not the case, we deduce that $S^4$ is not a fibre bundle with base and fiber of positive dimension. 

(This was too long to fit in a comment.) For subsets of the complex plane, a slightly different perspective is that the square of the quantity you want to maximize is the absolute value of the discriminant of the monic polynomial whose roots are precisely the points. Up to a factor depending only on the degree, the discriminant of a monic polynomial is the product of the values of the polynomial at the roots of the derivative. Also note that in the configuration you suggested, the derivative of the polynomial is almost the optimal polynomial for points on a circle: maybe you can prove that the derivative of an optimal polynomial is close to an optimal polynomial? 

Surely you can find the solutions to the equation if ab=0. Otherwise set $a^2=1/x$ and $b^2=1/y$ to turn your equation into the equation $1+x+y=0$. Is this enough? 

I would like to mention one more homotopy invariant of smooth projective varieties that is also a birational invariant. If $X$ is a smooth projective variety, then the torsion subgroup $T(X)$ of ${\rm H}^3(X,\mathbb{Z})$ is a birational invariant. This is explained in the beautiful paper "Some elementary examples of unirational varieties which are not rational" by Artin-Mumford, which starts exactly outlining a "homotopical" approach to showing that there exist unirational threefolds that are not rational. Their homotopic criterion is that rational varieties $X$ have trivial group $T(X)$ and they construct unirational varieties with non-trivial two-torsion in such group, showing that these are examples of unirational, non rational varieties. Finally, for surfaces the quantity $K^2+\rho$ is a birational invariant, where $K^2$ is the self intersection of the canonical divisor class on $X$ and $\rho$ is the rank of the N\'eron-Severi group of $X$). This is not too deep, as it is immediate knowing that a birational map of surfaces is a composition of blow ups and blow downs of smooth points (which for surfaces is quite easy!) and the above quantity is obviously invariant under a blow up. The reason for mentioning it, is that the N\'eron-Severi group can be defined in terms of Hodge theory, which, while not entirely homotopical, certainly has a homotopical feel to it. Moreover, many birational invariants are defined using Hodge structures, so it seemed useful to point it out! 

Let me expand on my comment. Let $E$ be an elliptic curve and let $p$ be a point of $E$ of infinite order. Embed $E$ in $\mathbb{P}^2$ as a plane cubic using the linear system $3O$, where $O$ is the origin of the group law. Remove from $\mathbb{P}^2$ the image of the point $p$ and note that $E \setminus \{p\}$ is affine. The inclusion of $E\setminus\{p\}$ in $\mathbb{P}^2 \setminus \{p\}$ is the required counter-example. Indeed, it is a closed immersion and if there were an affine open subset of $\mathbb{P}^2 \setminus \{p\}$ containing $E\setminus\{p\}$, then there would be a plane curve intersecting $E$ in only the point $p$. This is impossible, since the point $p$ has infinite order. 

The ring $R$ is graded by dimension, and it is trivial in dimension one, by the observation in the question. In dimension two, the connected orientable surfaces of genus at least two are all topological covers of the surface of genus two. In particular, the class of the 2-sphere and the class of the orientable surface of genus two represent in $R$, up to multiples, all orientable two manifolds. Using orientable double covers, we might also deal with the non-orientable ones, but I am not going to think about non-orientable surfaces. Observe that the sum of the two sphere and the surface of genus two has vanishing Euler characteristic: this is the first candidate for something with trivial Euler characteristic that might be non-zero! In fact, neither of these surfaces fibers over a circle (Euler characteristic is non-zero), and neither is a non-trivial cover of an orientable surface (Euler characteristic of a putative base space would have to be odd). Thus, there seems to be no possibility for a relation between these two surfaces. Therefore, unless I made a mistake, in the orientable case we have found a non-zero element in the kernel of $\chi$. 

I do not know a reference, but here is an easy argument. Consider the space $\overline{M}$ of pairs $(A,\lambda)$ where $A$ is a (self-adjoint) $N \times N$ matrix and $\lambda$ is a root of the characteristic polynomial of $A$. Over the open subset of $\overline{M}$ lying above the operators with distinct eigenvalues, the projection onto the first factor is clearly a proper smooth map, with finite fibers; in other words, the space $\overline{M}$ is a covering space over this open set. Since everything in sight is differentiable, the result that you want follows from the lifting of paths in the base. You need to choose an eigenvalue for the lifting to be unique, but you seem to know which one to choose! Btw, you only need the eigenvalue $\lambda$ to be simple for the same argument to work. In this case you can use the Implicit Function Theorem to lift the path, since the assumption on the simplicity of the root imply that the differential at the point is surjective. 

You can find the first statement, for instance, in van der Waerden, Modern Algebra I, Section 61. In particular, under the inclusion of the Galois group of the reduction in the Galois group of the original polynomial, the cycle structure matches up. For the statement when you drop the separability assertion, the answer is no. Here is an example in which the cycle structure of the two groups are incompatible. While this does not completely settle your second question, it might convince you that the answer is "no". The polynomial $f=x^4+x^2+9$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$ and has discriminant equal to $420^2$. Therefore the Galois group of $f$ is contained in the alternating group of order 4 and contains no transposition. The reduction of the polynomial modulo 3 is $x^2(x^2+1)$ and therefore has Galois group that is a transposition. Even though the Galois group of $f$ contains elements of order two, the cycle structures do not match up. 

It seems, that in the case in which E and F are direct sums of line bundles (and G is non-zero!), you can reconstruct E and F knowing that $E \otimes G \simeq F \otimes G$: this simply imitates the proof of the fact that vector bundles on $\mathbb{P}^1$ are sums of line bundles. Indeed, since the reconstruction is fine in the case in which G is a line bundle, we may replace E and F by E(e) and F(e) for any integer e: hence, exchanging if necessary E and F, we may suppose that E has a section and E(-1),F(-1) do not have sections. Let g be the integer such that G(g) has a section and G(g-1) does not. Thus we have $E \otimes G(g) \simeq F \otimes G(g)$; by considering global sections, we deduce that the multiplicity of the number of trivial direct summands in E is the same as the multiplicity in F. Remove the copies of $\mathcal{O}$ from both E and F and repeat. 

Yes. Suppose that you have a general $n \times n$ matrix M. The coefficient of $(-x)^k$ in the characteristic polynomial is the sum of all the principal minors of the matrix of size n-k. From this it follows that the "rank computed by the principal minors" can differ from the actual rank of the matrix only if the matrix is not diagonalizable. Since skew-symmetric matrices are diagonalizable, the result follows. 

This might be slightly off-topic, but I am surprised that no one mentioned Gauss' Quadratic Reciprocity: this is one of the very few fundamental results that allows you to deduce something about one prime, knowing something about a different prime. The intertwining is really surprising and (in some not so remote sense) it opens the way to Brauer-Manin obstructions. In fact, I am not sure that I know of any Brauer-Manin obstruction that may not eventually be reduced to an application of Quadratic Reciprocity. EDIT: The reason for bringing up the Brauer-Manin obstruction is that it provides "equations" in the space of adelic solutions to a diophantine problem. These relations, while somehow "invisible" from each individual prime, become apparent by considering all the primes at once. Gauss' reciprocity then comes in when trying to make everything explicit and "squeezing" the information from all the primes to an interaction between only two primes. This is the relation to the two primes in the question and to the various inverse limits of Z considered in the other answers. All of this was implicit in my comment, but I thought that it might be a good idea to expand in this. 

Proof. By Lemma 1 we know that there must be a line containing three points of $A$. If the points of $A$ were not collinear, then Lemma 2 would imply that $A$ does not have property (). Thus the points of $A$ are collinear. To conclude it suffices to show that if $A$ misses a point of the line containing $A$, then $A$ does not have property (). This is easy: let $a$ be a point of $A$ and let $\ell_1,\ell_2$ be distinct lines through $a$; let also $b$ be a point on the line containing $A$ not in $A$, and let $\ell_3$ be any line through $b$ not containing $A$. The triangle formed by $\ell_1,\ell_2,\ell_3$ is a blocking set disjoint from $A$. $\square$ 

Reading more carefully your question, I think that in the hint, the ruled surface is meant to only contain the lines that are part of the ruling, not the spurious ones that may come when you look at the scroll in P^3. Thus in the case of degree 1, you only get the lines through the point, in the case of degree two, you only get the lines in one ruling. I thus suspect that the three lines will be in the same ruling (otherwise they would intersect, which is not very generic) and hence the unique quadric containing them will be the 1 you need. You still need to make sure it is a reduced point. (Si, sono il damiano che conosci!) 

A "surface of infinite genus" $S$ is an example of a manifold that is not an open subset of a compact manifold. The reason $S$ cannot be embedded in a compact manifold is straightforward: we can find simple closed curves $a_1 , b_1 , \ldots , a_n , b_n , \ldots $ on $S$ such that, for each positive integer $g$, the curves $a_1 , b_1 , \ldots , a_g , b_g$ form a standard basis for a surface of genus $g$. Thus, considering the product in homology of the classes of these curves, we deduce that they are independent. If $S$ were an open subset of a compact manifold $M$, the same argument would imply that the images of the curves constructed above would also be independent in the homology of $M$. This contradicts the fact that the homology of the compact manifold $M$ is finite dimensional. Observe that this example is not particularly different from the example of the complement in the complex plane of the integers. Indeed, $S$ can be realized as the double cover of $\mathbb{C}$ branched along the integers.
