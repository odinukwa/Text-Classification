You simply tell your new employer that your previous company didn't give you a Form 16, and that you were getting paid through cash. Then, you ask them what they would like you to provide as an alternative. They may not actually need anything. But if they do, they will tell you what you must provide instead. 

That's a mistake. This is something your boss needs to know, and something your boss most likely would want to know. If you don't have regular one-on-one meetings, ask for some private time. Talk about what is going on, and what you should be doing about it. You were hired partly to learn from this colleague, but your work is being blocked. Tell your boss so you can accomplish the tasks you were hired to do. 

This avoids lying. And it's an impressive enough tale for interview purposes. Then you can really impress them with your skills, education, and job ability. Whatever exaggerations and/or lies you want to tell your friends informally in order to break the ice, would be your choice. 

She may also be offering you the chance to keep the same hours you have recently chosen to work, but at a reduced pay level, since you aren't working 40 hours per week. You indicated that you are in favor of a shorter work day - it sounds like this is your choice to make. There is nothing in what you have written that sounds punitive to me. It's just helping you align your future actions with what is being expected of you. 

Well, you may be without a job. Other than that, it's unlikely to have any negative impacts. It's possible that the company at which you worked for 3 months may be resentful and block any future attempts to be employed there. But I haven't seen that happen. 

Since you can say anything, a discussion about the constantly changing requirements is in order. Talk about why this makes your team's work difficult. And ask about how together you can avoid these changes. Perhaps a "steering committee" approach could give your team longer-term directions that won't require such abrupt changes. Or perhaps there is no solution and you and the team need to be prepared to change direction rapidly. If that's the case, talk about how to make this as efficient as possible. Perhaps the team needs fewer admins and more full-time task workers to give you more flexibility. Perhaps not. You are fortunate that you can "say anything". Communication is usually the key to progress. 

It's possible, but unlikely. HR seldom cares about such details. They will just want to know when is your last work day so that they can process all the relevant paperwork. And unless there is a corporate policy or law in play, HR will seldom go against the manager's wishes. If you are confident that your boss will receive the news well and appreciate the extra notice, then go ahead and try for 2 months. 

If the alternative is not working at all - that would be foolish both financially and professionally. If the alternative is a software development internship, if might be good. QA work isn't hurting your prospects. Don't abandon it unless you have something better to do. 

Generally discussions about employment status should be conducted face-to-face whenever possible. It that regard, it's also easier to ask and answer questions, and to respond to non-verbal cues. 

Yes. That would be the one or two-line summary. ("provides SEO services for small-to-medium sized corporations in the metropolitan New York area") 

Try to act like a mature professional and avoid all lies. Immaturity is what many employers worry about when a teenager applies for a job. Don't start your search off on the wrong foot. If you have any relevant educational qualifications, include them. But 1 month of college won't be relevant for any programming jobs I've ever seen- leave that out. The reasons you felt compelled to leave after 1 month aren't likely to make you a better candidate in the eyes of a recruiter/interviewer. Leave them out of your resume. If you have self-guided educational attainments that could be independently confirmed (such as some sort of certification), you could include that. But if you only have a K-12 education, omit the Education section completely when applying for a programming position. No employers care where their programmers went to High School. 

You aren't capable of providing a list of reasons why other people are leaving. Only they can do that. You could provide a long list of reasons why you think they are leaving, but that's the best you could realistically do, and taking those sorts of guesses isn't something I'd advise. You can provide a long list of why you are leaving, should you choose to do so. Again, not something I'd advise. For me, I almost always stick with the safe, generic "I'm leaving for a better opportunity" reasons. In my experience, little good can come of a laundry list of "all the problems I see". Venting (even if asked) might make you feel better, but won't do you any good in the long run. And venting (even if requested) almost certainly won't make things better for the folks you leave behind. If the boss' boss really wanted to know what was going on she/he would be more tuned in with current employees, and wouldn't rely on an unhappy employee on their way out to open his/her eyes. Only you can decide what you actually choose to do in this situation. If it were me, I'd speak only happy thoughts, put this job behind me, and move on. (The only times I've ever deviated from that practice are when I had a close personal relationship with the founder, or with an influential boss. In those two cases, I gave my honest opinion and advice. In both cases, it didn't matter in the long term as both companies went under within a year.) 

I assume the "coding project style interview" doesn't consume months of your time. Thus, you aren't really talking about a huge trade-off here. I'm also assuming that you have at least some insight into the desirability of the position, and your fit in the company, before you are asked to spend time on the project. We all get to decide if what is being asked of us during the interview process is "worth it" or not. That's a very personal decision. That's a decision that only you can make. Some people wouldn't be willing to spend more than an hour or two interviewing. Others are willing to devote more time. For me, I will only interview for jobs that I think will be very much worth having. Consequently, I'm willing to show a fair bit of extra effort in an attempt to convince the potential employer that I'm a good fit for the job. I've sought jobs where I've had multiple days of interviews with several levels of management. I've sought jobs where I had to prepare and conduct a presentation in front of a panel. I've sought jobs where I had to interview at two different locations on the same day. I sought one job where I was asked to perform some real work (but on my own time) before being hired. I accepted those conditions because I felt that the potential jobs made the effort worthwhile. Maybe you aren't pursuing really good jobs, so the interviews aren't worth much of your time. If that's the case, then ignore all the jobs where you have to expend any effort in the interviews and hope for the best. Otherwise, a good job is worth a bit of effort, so extend yourself and follow their requirements. Knock the coding project out of the park and get the really good job. In the overall scheme of things a few extra weeks of work are very minor. Note: My answer assumes ethical behavior on both sides. Whenever there is illegal/unethical behavior, then this answer may not apply. 

In your question you spent a lot of words explaining why this arrangement would be good for you, but none about why it will be good for the company. Focus on the company when you ask for an accommodation. While they may be happy for you, and supportive of your motives, from the business/management side they still must consider "what's in it for us?", "how will this impact us?" and "what do we do about it?" First, point out the benefit to the company of your having an additional half-year of education. Explain what you will be learning that you don't already know, and how those subjects will make you a better employee, more productive, and more effective. Second, point out how you can continue to be very productive in your current job - even while working remotely, and even at a reduced workload. Point out where your past work demonstrates how you can be trusted to work remotely, explain your plan for how you intend to stay in the loop on all necessary information, talk about how you will effectively attend meetings remotely, and how you will update your boss on your status despite being remote and despite any time differences. If it's true, explain how the time difference will work to their advantage. Explain the kinds of things you will be able to handle in your time zone, that will help others in the home office be more effective. Hint (but don't directly state) that you will have to leave if your accommodation isn't accepted. You don't want to blatantly threaten here, but just want to indicate that you definitely intend to study abroad one way or the other. Explain how this accommodation will keep you around as a loyal employee for the long term. Avoid bringing up the "I consider myself to be underpaid" angle. It's not relevant to this accommodation, and could easily derail your discussion. Focus on your 1/2 year plan. Deal with your pay in a year or so, once your education is complete. As JeffO astutely suggests, you could even offer to work a few days remotely now, in order to demonstrate to the company that you can be trusted and effective working remotely. Doing it now gives them a chance to experience what it will be like during your studies - perhaps even before they commit to your accommodation. If they are as shocked as you think they will be, you may have to talk with several folks and be very convincing. Think this through ahead of time from their point of view so that you can have as strong discussion topics as possible. And of course be prepared to leave gracefully if it doesn't work out as you hope. Or as The Wandering Dev Manager correctly suggests, you could ask for a 6-month sabbatical. If you are currently an excellent employee, your company may be willing to grant that concession. 

That might help you get more interviews. Make sure you keep yourself up to date on newer technologies and processes. Take courses and/or participate in open source projects if needed. Make sure you know, and can use, current buzzwords while avoiding older terms. Consider companies and roles where age may not be a hindrance. For example, often management is expected to be on the older side. Some development-related roles tend to skew older that roles for pure coders. Network with friends near your age who can give you an idea which companies might be hiring folks with your "depth of experience". More tips: $URL$ 

That is rather unusual in my experience. You could ask the hiring manager (or whoever made the offer) what new hires usually do in this circumstance. I would assume you would need to find and pay for your own private insurance for the 3 months, or use your spouse's benefits. 

If you hadn't yet received the promotion and bonus, would your current company feel any better about your leaving? Unless both you and they believed that this promotion+bonus was designed to keep you around for a long time, the answer is probably "No." Things happen. Circumstances change. Opportunities for growth arise. Employers understand this. While employers would like to keep most people around forever, most employers realize that this just doesn't happen in the real world. If your leaving burns any bridges, it most likely won't be due solely to leaving soon after a promotion+bonus. And if you give your notice professionally, and work with them to help in the transition, they most likely won't view your leaving as less than professional. 

Assuming your answer was honest, there was absolutely nothing wrong with it. If you didn't have a performance review, then you can't answer that you did. And adding what your supervisors said about you gave the interviewer the feedback that took the place of a formal performance review. Well done. As MJ6 correctly indicates in his comments, you can even frame your answer in terms similar to those which would have come out of a formal review process, had one existed. Try to remember feedback and/or praise you received regarding deadlines, leadership, positive attitude under stress - these can all make your answer even more powerful. I suspect you are over-thinking this. Perhaps the interviewer was hoping for some sort of formal review, but I can't see how the lack of one could matter much. Either way, it's done. No need to worry about it now. 

Yes. Since B specifically asked about A's offer, and since the offer has recently been increased, you should inform them of the current value of this offer now. Waiting until you get an offer from B may signal that you are just playing games. Still, be prepared to make a decision about A's offer in a timely manner. You don't yet have an offer from B, you may never actually get one, and at some point A is going to get tired of waiting. 

Again, the truth. Write that you are seeking a short-term temporary position. Then write why you would be a terrific fit for the short-term contract they are offering. 

Sure, it's "acceptable". Since (going along with your original assumption) nobody else should know your password, there is nobody to be offended other than you. 

As long as the incorrect information was supplied by your friend, and not by you, this almost certainly won't affect your career in the company. If you are asked why you and your friend had different answers, you can simply say "I don't know. Perhaps he was just nervous or confused." You should probably have a quick chat with your friend and make sure you are both on the same page with future referrals. 

Talk to your boss. Ask how bonuses work at your company. And ask "What should I do to put myself into position to get a good bonus?" In your conversation try to get past the "what HR says about bonuses" and into the "what actually happens at your company". In some companies, bonuses are earned due to single important events ("land a key account", "complete an important research project on time", "deliver a software release in time for an annual user meeting"). In other companies, bonuses are earned by some sort of metric ("score at least 90 on the '360 degrees feedback questionnaire' "). In many companies it's a mix of imposed goals, agreed-upon goals, company performance, and subjective factors. Nobody here can tell you whether that will mean you must work "absurd hours" or not. Only your boss can tell you that. From your words ("scam", "dupe" "absurd"), it seems as if you have already drawn your own conclusion. Try to confirm that with your boss rather than just assuming. Then decide what you want to do about it (if anything), other than just be unhappy. 

She was trying to hint to you that you were starting to leave early, that it was being noticed, and that maybe you shouldn't do that anymore. She was trying to tell you that you are supposed to work for 8 hours, not just be in the office for 8 hours every day. She is telling you that lunch is not part of that 8 hour period. 

I would never give any weight to a candidate who touted "I'm low cost" as one of their attributes. Perhaps in other contexts, in other companies, or other locales, the conditions might favor the "least expensive". That has never been the case for me. 

There is always wiggle room. There is never a case where a company couldn't pay someone more if they so choose. The only way you will know if you could get a raise is to ask. Indicate that you feel you are worth more and that you deserve more. Leave the multiplier and any other external factors out of it. Tread a bit lightly here. You are part time. And the company lets you adjust your hours based on your individual needs. You don't want to come across as overly demanding. You want to ensure smooth sailing for your graduation, so that bringing you on full-time becomes a no-brainer. Save the serious salary negotiations for that time frame.
