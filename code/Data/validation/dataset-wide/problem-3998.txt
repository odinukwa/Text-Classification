$\mathbb{H}^{0}(X, \mathcal{A}^{\bullet})$ identifies with infinitesimal automorphisms. $\mathbb{H}^{1}(X, \mathcal{A}^{\bullet})$ identifies with infinitesimal deformations. There exists an obstruction map $Ob: \mathbb{H}^{1}(X, \mathcal{A}^{\bullet})\rightarrow \mathbb{H}^{2}(X, \mathcal{A}^{\bullet}\otimes \mathcal{A}^{\bullet})$ such that $\alpha\in \mathbb{H}^{1}(X, \mathcal{A}^{\bullet})$ satisfies $Ob(\alpha)=0$ if and only if $\alpha$ is tangent to an honest deformation. 

For experts in the analysis of minimal surfaces I will state the question first; then I will follow up with details. Question: Does the $\varepsilon$-regularity theorem of Choi and Schoen ($URL$ for minimal surfaces in three-dimensional Riemannian manifolds extend to Riemannian manifold targets of arbitrary dimension? For non-experts, let me state the $\varepsilon$-regularity result of Choi and Schoen. Let $(M,h)$ be a three dimensional Riemannian manifold and suppose \begin{align} f: \Sigma \rightarrow M \end{align} is an immersed minimal surface; here the topology of $\Sigma$ is arbitrary. Let $(g,B)$ denote the induced metric and second fundamental form via the immersion $f.$ The following $\varepsilon$-regularity theorem posits that sufficient control on the $L^{2}$-norm of $B$ on balls of controlled size implies $L^{\infty}$-bounds on $B$ on balls of controlled size. Theorem: There exists constants $\varepsilon, \rho>0,$ (which depend only on the curvature of $M$ and it's covariant derivatives), such that if $r_{0}<\rho, \ x\in M$ and \begin{align} f(\Sigma)\cap \partial B_{r_{0}}(x)=\partial(f(\Sigma)\cap B_{r_{0}}(x)), \end{align} the following property holds. If there exists $0<\delta\leq 1$ such that \begin{align} \int_{B_{r_{0}}(x)\cap f(\Sigma)} \lVert B\rVert^{2} dV_{g}< \delta\varepsilon, \end{align} then for all $0<\sigma\leq r_{0}$ and all $y\in B_{r_{0}-\sigma}(x)\cap f(\Sigma)$, \begin{align} \sigma^{2}\lVert B\rVert^{2}(y)<\delta. \end{align} In the above theorem, $B_{r}(x)$ is the Riemannian ball of radius $r>0$ in the manifold $M$ and $dV_{g}$ is the Riemannian volume element of the metric $g$ on $\Sigma.$ Lastly, the symbol $\partial$ indicates the topological boundary of a set. My question is if the manifold $M$ can be replaced by a Riemannian manifold of arbitrary dimension. These types of regularity estimates date back to the work of Sacks-Uhlenbeck on minimal surfaces, and are an indispensable tool for the study of asymptotics to solutions of many systems of partial differential equations that have a geometric origin: examples include the Yang-Mills equations, the self-duality equations, the study of minimal surfaces, and more generally, harmonic maps. Unfortunately, for the most part I'm a casual observer to these developments and some basic google searches haven't pulled up any papers claiming this can be extended to arbitrary co-dimension. The obvious thing to do is to dive into the proof of Choi and Schoen, but before I undertake such a task, I was hoping someone here might save me the time. I appreciate any suggestions and/or references. Thank you. 

As for question 4, the answer is well understood for the fundamental groups of surfaces, or more generally for "formal spaces" $X$. In summary: renumber your series so that $G_1=G$. Then $V_i:=G_i/G_{i+1}$ is a free $\mathbb Z$-module for all $i$, and the direct sum $L:=\bigoplus_{i\ge1}V_i$ is a graded Lie algebra over $\mathbb Z$. E.g. for surface groups, it admits as presentation the natural linearization of the group presentation: $$L=\langle A_1,B_1,\dots,A_g,B_g\mid [A_1,B_1]+\dots+[A_g,B_g]=0\rangle.$$ The enveloping algebra of $L$ is a quadratic Koszul algebra, and its Koszul dual $U(L)^!$ is isomorphic to the cohomology algebra of $X$. The ranks of the sections $V_i$ may be recovered from the Betti numbers of $X$ using Koszul duality and Möbius invertion. More precisely, if $b_i$ are the Betti numbers of $X$, and $b(t)=\sum b_i t^i$ is its Poincaré series, and $c(t)=\sum c_i t^i$ is the Poincaré series of $U(L)$, then Koszul duality gives $c(-t)b(t)=1$. Then $c(t)=\prod_{i\ge1}(1-t^i)^{-\dim V_i}$ lets you compute $\dim V_i$. 

Consider a subgroup $L\le(\mathbb Z/2)^n$, or equivalently a family of subsets of $\{1,\dots,n\}$ closed under symmetric difference. I would like an algorithm that gives me a basis of $L$ whose vectors have as small overlaps as possible in their support; equivalently, a generating family of subsets with as small intersections as possible. Presumably, the sets corresponding to the basis will themselves again be as small as possible. The same question can be asked for a subgroup $L\le\mathbb Z^n$. I suspect the problem "Can one find a generating family of $L$ with intersections of size at most $k$?" is NP-complete, so relaxations are welcome. I tried $LLL$-reducing the integer basis, but the result is far from optimal. I get better results by $LLL$-reducing, randomly permuting the vectors, and repeating; but this is again doesn't seem to give very good results. I also tried to start with a basis, and applying elementary transformations "$v_i\leftarrow v_i\pm v_j$" to it so as to reduce intersection sizes. This seems to lead to local minima which are not very good. The parameters I am interested in are $n$ in the thousands, and $L$ of dimension about $n/2$. 

I'll (try to) answer the question specifically in the case of Ricci flow. View the Ricci flow on a closed manifold $M$ as an initial value problem on the positive cone of positive definite symmetric two-tensors, where given an initial metric $g(0),$ we wish to find a path of metrics $g(t)$ solving, \begin{align} \frac{\partial{g(t)}}{\partial{t}}=-2\text{Ric}_{g(t)}(g(t)). \end{align} Suppose we have a solution $g(t)$ and let $f:M\rightarrow M$ be any diffeomorphism. Then by the naturality of these tensors $f^{*}g$ is a solution as well. If the Ricci flow was a parabolic equation, then (part of) elliptic regularity (using compactness of M) would guarantee that the solution space is finite dimensional. But, as the diffeomorphism group is infinite dimensional, we have exhibited an infinite dimensional space of solutions, hence the equation is not parabolic. More directly, calculating the principal symbol of the linearization of the second order differential operator, \begin{align} \Gamma(S_{>0}^{2}(T^*M))&\rightarrow \Gamma(S^{2}(T^*M))\\ g &\mapsto Ric(g), \end{align} one can explicitly cook up cotangent directions where the principal symbol is non-invertible, also showing that the equation is not parabolic. Someone more well versed in PDE may correct me if I've said something wrong, but this is the gist of the argument. The "DeTurck trick" in these cases is to find a way to "break" this diffeomorphism invariance by changing the metric by a carefully chosen diffeomorphism (which results in an elliptic equation) and then showing that one can back-solve to get an honest solution of the Ricci flow. You can find calculations of the principal symbol and a discussion of these ideas in this honors thesis $URL$ and follow the references therein for more details. 

Let $g$ be a Lie ring (Lie algebra over $\mathbb Z$), and let $U(g)$ and $S(g)$ denote the universal enveloping and symmetric algebra of $g$. The Poincaré-Birkhoff-Witt theorem (in the form proved by Lazard, see "Sur les algebres enveloppantes universelles de certaines algebres de Lie, M Lazard - Publ. Sci. Univ. Alger. Ser. A, 1954) yields a ring isomorphism between $S(g)$ and an associated graded of $U(g)$. I can prove that $S(g)$ and $U(g)$ are isomorphic as $\mathbb Z$-modules; this essentially follows from the proof by Lazard. Is this already known? 

I'm interested in tilings of the plane by squares, with labels on the edges. It's well known that (1) the question "can one tile the plane with the following finite set of tiles?" is undecidable, and (2) there are finite sets of tiles that tile the plane, but only aperiodically. Also, (1) implies (2). Is the question "can one tile the plane periodically with the following finite set of tiles?" decidable? 

Yves's answer explains why $BS(n,\pm n)$ is virtually (a free group) x $\mathbb Z$. In particular, it is linear over $\mathbb Z$, and so may be generated by automata. This is the statement in the article [BS]. 

I recall having read, some time ago, a beautiful and poetic opening of an article (or was it a book?). From memory, it was by Shigefumi Mori, and talked about the (mathematical) universe consisting of two hemispheres, a real and a p-adic; somehow meeting at the equator. We mere humans should strive to contemplate both sides and their connections. I have tried to locate the precise reference of this text, including some of Mori's papers, but failed. In fact, I'm not anymore sure it was Mori. Does some kind soul know which reference I'm trying to recall? 

This seems to have nothing to do with Kahler manifolds, at least not how you have stated it. Any $C^{\infty}$-complex vector bundle over a paracompact smooth manifold admits a Hermitian metric, by employing a partition of unity. The imaginary part of this Hermitian metric is a skew-symmetric, non-degenerate bilinear form on each fiber which makes that complex vector bundle into a symplectic vector bundle. 

Then, given any family of such structures over a pointed base $(B, b_{0}),$ there exists a Kodaira-Spencer map $KS: T_{b_{0}}B\rightarrow \mathbb{H}^{1}(X, \mathcal{A}^{\bullet}).$ Furthermore, if Condition A is satisfied, then there exists an open neighborhood $B$ of $0\in Ob^{-1}(0)$ and a versal family over $B$ giving a (germ of a) deformation of the structure on $X.$ Before closing, let me remark that while very powerful, for the scope of this question I'm not interested in algebraic techniques (say when $X$ is a projective) which circumvent this issue by constructing a global moduli space (or stack...). In particular, this problem probably can't be solved using geometric invariant theory, or any of the other standard techniques in algebraic geometry. I am insisting we stay in the category of complex manifolds, or perhaps the larger category of complex analytic spaces. I can go into more detail about the kind of problems I'm interested in, but to save space, let me stop for now and leave the question as it stands. I appreciate any references or insights anyone may have. 

It follows from Weil's rigidity theorem $URL$ that given any uniform lattice in $SU(n,1)$ with $n>1,$ it has no local deformations, in fact no non-trivial first order deformations. If $n=1$ then the the symmetric space is the real hyperbolic plane and there is a large family of deformations for surface groups. Now, if you don't require the lattice condition, then there may or may not be deformations. The case of a surface group is the most well understood (to me at least). It is a theorem of Toledo that a discrete surface group (here surface means closed, oriented and genus at least two) in $SU(2,1)$ which stabilizes a totally geodesic holomorphic hyperbolic plane in $\mathbb{CH}^2$ is locally rigid. But, surfaces groups which stabilize a totally real lagrangian hyperbolic plane in $\mathbb{CH}^2$ admit many deformations, these are so-called complex hyperbolic quasi-Fuchsian groups and their deformations are still far from well understood. Maybe Misha Kapovich (who posts here and is an expert) might add some more interesting comments at some point.
