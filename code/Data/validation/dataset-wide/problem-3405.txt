The last and most important step is that you need lots of money for advertising. I don't mean ads as in the traditional way, I mean to create products that use the language - for it to get big, it needs to be in cartoons, tv shows, on product packaging, etc. People need to just go to their favourite website and notice the name of the language on the sidebar, for whatever reason. It needs to show up when Google searching. 

Actually, this is exactly how Esperanto was originally planned. Instead of taking words from other languages, all the vocabulary was one- or two-syllable words (ex. ab, ba, ca, ac, all being different root words). Then the creator of Esperanto realized that he couldn't even remember what the vocabulary meant himself, and so he thought that if he couldn't remember then no one else would be able to either. Eventually he realized it would simply be easier to remember if the roots were form languages he already knew, even if they were long. (After he had already decided he was going to take words from French/Latin and German, that's when he realized he should take only the most international words, it's not that he had this whole idea from the beginning.) I can't speak for any other constructed language, but it might be that the creators found out the same as he did. 

There have been studies (or at least small amounts of research) done on Swedish University students, among other nationalities, where the students learnt Esperanto AFTER already knowing multiple languages (in the case of Swedes, most know English, Swedish, and French/German/Spanish at least - and then continue their third language or pick up a fourth one in Uni). There was still a significant improvement in the people who learnt Esperanto compared to the normal people. Sadly I can't link you to the info on this where I read it, as it's in Faroese which doesn't even have Google Translate. The basic idea is, if you're already very strong in grammar then there's no need to learn Esperanto. If so, the only way it would help, would be in vocabulary, as Esperanto's vocabulary is something like 60% Latin or Romance. This actually isn't something to scoff at, as there have been a few studies where ex. people who knew Esperanto could translate a French sentence without having ever learnt French (I personally, just today, understood a basic Spanish conversation that I was overhearing, thanks to Esperanto too). If you're a bit weak in grammar, for example you always forget when to use an adverb, then Esperanto will still help. And in all honesty, it's so fast to learn that it can't hurt you to spend some time on it even if you think it's useless - at the very least, you can easily find an Italian penpal who knows Esperanto well enough that you two can actually talk properly enough for them to give you really good help on Italian (this is relatively hard to do in English). 

The same is true for vocabulary. It needs to ALL make sense through common sense. For example, a "water cooker" needs to be able to mean a "tea kettle" and be correct. 

(Apologies, I'm writing this comment in a way so that even passersby who have zero knowledge of Esperanto can make more sense of it) As for the research, honestly there's quite a few very easily findable online, especially via Wikipedia reference links on various pages related to Esperanto. The "open library" has a few books with research summaries in them at least, one being here. The one problem is that when you're reading only in English, they tend to only be looking at how Esperanto helps with Romance languages (because that's all English-speaking countries tend to care about, not because Esperanto only helps with those). If you know anyone who speaks Esperanto, it's much easier to find the research on it through that, and there are also relatively a lot of studies on it done by France so try searching in French if possible. (There's even been notes, if not exact studies, in Swedish among other languages). While I've read a lot of reports, I haven't kept the links to any of them, but I found them by simply searching for general information about Esperanto. Any remaining research reports basically need to be actually purchased from somewhere (ex. a University). Here's just a couple: Modern research, date unknown, better sources for it must be able to be found: About how the Chinese counting system improves mathmatics grades, among other things. Esperanto uses the same exact counting system, the words are just a tiny bit longer to say: $URL$ 2012-2013: Various reports from Australia on the effects of using Esperanto in primary school as a first second-language for the children: $URL$ Since I haven't saved any more links, here I will show you some examples I've personally gathered, for why Esperanto helps with learning other languages. It's not exact scientific research but it ends up being pretty obvious in showing how Esperanto helps, I think anyway. I have to first summarize the main idea, by saying that in Esperanto, word-construction (compounds, affixes), grammar markers (anger vs angry vs. angrily; accusative case), certain words (reflexive pronouns), and so on are simply the basics of grammar of most languages, especially Indo-European ones. It's the same as going through a page of a book, and colour-coding which words are adjectives in one colour, which words are nouns in another colour, which are direct/indirect objects in another colour. That is partially what greatly speeds up the learning of other languages; it very, very clearly teaches you when to use each form of a word in a sentence, whether it's in Esperanto or any other language. Especially compared to English, Esperanto has a small base vocabulary with few synonyms, which very closely mirrors languages like Japanese and Swedish; the remaining necessary words are created by compounds in all three of these languages. That's another main reason for why Esperanto speeds up learning, because the English-speaker's brain is already trained to use "only basic words", as must be done in most foreign languages. Now for some explicit language comparisions so you see what I mean: 1. Vocabulary and word make-up (forgive me for not bolding the relevant parts, I'm too lazy): Esperanto (EO): kat-ido, hund-ido, ĉeval-ido Swedish (SV): katt-unge, hund-unge, häst-unge Japanese (JP):こねこ、こいぬ、こうま English (EN): "baby cat, baby dog, baby horse", kitten, puppy, foal ———  (EO) manĝ-voli, tranĉ-ilo, vet-eto (Greenlandic) neri-uma, savi-mmik, eqquiniu-nnguaq (JP) たべ・たい、こ・がたな、こ・かけ (EN) "eat-want, cut-tool, wager-ette", to want to eat, a knife, a small bet. Note that in Japanese instead of cut-tool, "small sword" is said. 2. Accusative case: (EO) ĉi tie, ĉi tien, hejme, hejmen, ekstere, eksteren, li, lin (SV) här, hit, hem, hemåt, ute, ut, han, honom (EN) here, hither, home, homewards, outside, out, he, him ———— (EO) La kato kuras sub la sofo  (Faroese, FO) Kettan rennur undir sofuni (EN) The cat runs around under the sofa (without leaving the underside of it)  ———— (EO) La kato kuras sub la sofon (FO) Kettan rennur undir sofuna  (EN) The cat runs underneath the sofa (it runs from outside of the sofa, to underneath it) 3. Reflexive pronoun difference: (I don't know French etc. but I'm fairly sure they have the exact same difference) (EO) La knaboj ludas kun sia kato  (FO) Dreingirnir spæla við sína kettu   (SV) Pojkarna spelar med sin katt   (EN) The boys play with their cat (their own cat) ———— (EO) La knaboj ludas kun ilia kato  (FO) Dreingirnir spæla við teirra kettu  (SV) Pojkarna spelar med deras katt  (EN) The boys play with their cat (a cat owned by someone else) ———— (EO) Faru ĝin mem. Li ŝatas sin. Ĉesu vundi sin mem (SV) Göra det själv. Han gillar sig. Sluta skada sig själv (EN) Do it yourself. He likes himself. Stop injuring yourself As you can see, even in non-Indo-European languages such as Greenlandic and Japanese, there can be some direct similarities to Esperanto. This definitely isn't all the similarities but it's just a a taste. It's really hard to describe most of the similarities in just a few words or examples since English is just too different, plus I don't want to go into the grammer etc. of Japanese and so on, so I don't want to go on any further. That includes giving better examples of compound words among other things. Sorry about that, I'm just too lazy. Of course, every similarity is what helps you with a foreign language. 

The vocabulary has to be usable in daily life. You need to be able to write blog posts or software in the language, for example. At the same time there needs to be technical words too, like for textbooks. Otherwise people either see it as useless or as not "sophisticated enough". 

There are languages created by groups, but they aren't international and they're more like dialects of existing languages. For example, Mandarin, New Norwegian, and Modern Hebrew; these are all successful constructed languages (or dialects) but I doubt they were made by a single person. You can also argue that languages like French or Icelandic, which almost always create all new words instead of taking loanwords for new ideas and things, are artificial (this is done by groups and organizations too). But for a world-wide language project, the people who want to create a good international language have no money, therefore no support, advertising, clout, etc. The existing organizations, like the UN, which by all means should create their own language or use some kind of bridge language like Esperanto, don't want to do so because it means "change" (they're scared of changing stuff and then failing even more than they are now, on the language issue). For example, ANY language no matter if constructed or not, would get big if it sent abroad as many movies as the USA does; likewise, anyone would try learning a language if they were given a fistful of cash in order to do so (meaning, learn it and we'll pay you extra to act in a movie for it). However the people who do have this kind of money don't care one bit, for example, many rich Americans donate extremely little money to charity compared to, for example, rich Swedes - and creating or sponsoring an international language is just like a form of charity. Otherwise, organizations actually look for solutions in the wrong area without even considering the constructed language idea, ex. simply telling everyone to learn whatever is the biggest language at the time (French, Latin, English, Chinese), simply spending more money on translators, simply trying to have kids learn 3 foreign languages in school, etc. The last aspect is English itself, basically English-speakers are much less likely to learn other languages and they're much more likely to force their language on others (McDonald's advertises in English here in Sweden, for example). This is true whether it's the UK or the US, but the problem is that those countries are where a LOT of money is, a lot of organizations, and so on - and they live in such an English-speaking bubble that they don't actually realize how much of a language problem exists for the rest of the world. The basic idea that most countries nowadays have is, if the English-speaking population doesn't like something, it's not going to get enough money or support for it to become a world-wide success (which isn't true at all, but it's the psychology that matters). 

Ease of word order. While a language like English has very fixed word order and relatively simple grammar, it not only makes it difficult for people from drastically different languages, but the problem comes that if you're not allowed to have a different word order and convey the same meaning then you're going to lose support of everyone in favour of a "more logical" language (ex. you should be able to be correct as long as the correct meaning is understandable through common sense). Likewise, the language has to be tolerant of mistakes, as people generally have a fear of being wrong and the culture that eventually arises from the language should be friendly towards learners (not "i'm better than you at it, it's difficult so i'm smart") in order to not discourage people in learning. 

Of course, it needs to be able to be written on mobile phones and computers with very little effort. This also means there needs to be very little grammatical exceptions (if any), and all of the most common words are very short, ideally one syllable (ex. "is, eat, need"). Otherwise the language is cumbersome. There also needs to have a flexibility like Esperanto, wherein you can say either "I go" or "I am going" depending on construction, but the usage is restricted to individual's tastes. The point is that, people like things that are customizable. They want to be able to play with the language and feel like it's their own, so it can't be so rigid. (This is also why videogames such as The SIMs and Don't Starve get really popular - it's basically free choice on how you want to play the game.) There also can't be tones or pitch to change meaning, as this is largely seen as difficult. Basically, look at Japanese and Finnish.
