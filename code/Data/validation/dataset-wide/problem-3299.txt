Post-copular DPs do not need Case because they are not arguments of copular be. Such DPs, as Atamiri says, are (one-place) 'predicates' or constituents of 'predicates' (see Bowers' alternative analysis infra), their only argument is, indeed, theta-marked internally to the DP, at some stage occupies the Spec DP position, and, eventually, raises into Spec T/Infl and becomes the subject of the copular sentence. Note, however, that this applies only to cases of copular be, not to those in which be expresses identity (i.e., 'A is B' : 'A = B') as in That tall woman is John's wife / John's wife is that tall woman, where be is a two-place verb with two 'reversible' arguments, one in complement position and the other - under the VP-Internal Subject Hypothesis - in Spec VP (= Spec be). Whichever of the two DPs functions as complement of 'identificational' be does need Case, of course, but that causes no problem, because dyadic be is transitive-like and assigns (accusative?) Case to its internal argument. Copular be, on the contrary, selects just a non-verbal one-place predicate as its complement, i.e., minimally a 'predicative' DP in the cases you are interested in. The hedge 'minimally' is not gratuitous, though, because there is fairly compelling syntactic evidence that the complements of 'copular be' are not directly 'predicative' DPs, but Predication Phrases headed by a 'functional' Pred head that selects a DP as its complement (i.e., structures like [__ Pred [DP]]) and assigns Case to it. (See John Bowers' 'The Syntax of Predication', Linguistic Inquiry 24/4 (1993), pp. 591-656, or his more recent summary 'Predication', in The Handbook of Contemporary Syntactic Theory, Blackwell 2001, pp. 298-333 for classic statements of this alternative view). 

Yes, there is, and for the same reason there is evidence against the 'no tampering' computational principle of current Merge-based minimalist syntax: sublexical elements (typically 'features', [attribute: value] pairs) must be visible to computational operations and result affected by them (e.g., unvalued [A:v] pairs get valued as a result of syntactic operations),and, conversely, sublexical [A: v] features trigger/block syntactic operations. Also, at the semantic level, 'coercion' modifies the internal features of lexical items as they get constructed with neighbouring lexical items, and not only 'locally' (as a consequence of direct 'external Merge' between two lexical units L1 and L2), but also non-locally, as when a noun or verb undergo 'meaning coercion' resulting from NPs or VPs being subsequently constructed with e.g. certain adverbials. Under a strict view of lexical integrity, none of that should occur. Needless to say, parallel reasoning applies to the 'phonological' component of the grammar to the extent sub-lexical phonological features can be affected by comparable features of neighbouring lexical items, obvious cases being 'sandhi' and vowel harmony phenomena. Finally, of course 'lexical integrity' cannot be a principle of any grammar in which at some point (say 'Spell Out', in standard minimalist grammar) the computation branches into two sub-computations, one sending 'meaning'-related information towards the 'conceptual-intentional interface' and the other sending 'sound'-related information towards the 'articulatory-perceptual' one. The latter argument, of course, applies only to theories like Chomsky's minimalist grammar, but the preceeding ones, terminological issues aside, are more generally applicable to all theories of grammar I am aware of to the extent they are explicit as to the computations they presuppose. 

In spite of what elementary textbooks tend to say, i.e., that the values of Comp are that (or 'null that'), whether, if and for (or 'null' for) in English, there is well established syntactic evidence that that initial analysis - dating back to the late 60's and early 70's - was incorrect. As a matter of fact, whether is, like when, why, where, how much, what book, under what conditions, etc., a wh-phrase landing in Spec Focus, not a Comp head. The simplest argument in this respect is that whether can be coordinated with other wh-phrases that must themselves occupy Spec Focus, whereas if cannot. Thus, in I would like to know whether and (,if so,) under what conditions I could postpone payment of my teaching fees, whether is clearly coordinated with a PP phrase and both land first in Spec Focus and then in Spec C (not in Focus and C!). Or, to take a different example, whether can also be coordinated with not, as in I would like to know whether or not I am admitted to the AI programme, where not is independently known to be a phrase base-generated in Spec Polarity (but not in the head of Polarity, as initially assumed). On the contrary, if, a C head, cannot be so coordinated, cf. * I would like to know if or not I am admitted to the AI programme. Confirming evidence is available if you consider the etymology of whether (from OE hw-aeither) - or, for that matter, that of not (from n(e)+a+wiht, approximately 'not a bit', a negative noun phrase). Significantly, in Old and Middle English, hwaether did not interfere with the ascension of the finite verb into the head of FocusP. Although it is true that the finite verb did not have to ascend in hwaether-introduced clauses, and did not usually do (as in Modern English), the OED still cites quite a few OE and ME examples in which it does, yielding the word order ...hwaether + Verb + Subject...). Of course, if hwaether had been a C (or Focus) head, such verb-raising would not have been possible in any case, because the finite verb is itself a head and can raise only into an empty head position (= Head Movement). Consequently, hwaether was already a specifier, as it is today, in Old and Middle English. 

As far as I know, in any P&PT/Minimalist work subsequent to Cinque's (1999) important hypothesis about the structure of adverbials, there is much more structure involved than you show in your diagramme. Epistemic adverbials like certainly, probably and possibly, in particular, would have to be attached to the projection in that (surface) order (i.e., certainly with scope over probably and probably with scope over possibly) in appropriate specifiers of 'adverbial' functional heads intervening between the subject and the tensed auxiliary or between further (visible or invisible) 'modal' heads. Whether they can all be piled up within a single clause or not depends on their meaning and on the number of auxiliaries (say 'subclauses') the clause contains. However, none of those intervening adverbs can possibly interfere with processes like the subject's ascension to Spec TP (or the Spec of whatever head the subject is attracted to) or with the finite verb's own raising into the corresponding head. Intervening adverbs are simply invisible to such processes, because they are triggered - subject to 'minimality' or, nowadays, 'economy' ('shortest movement') - by specific features of DPs and verbs that adverbs just lack. Of course, if your question literally means 'Is there any adverb that can cause the clause to be ungrammatical if inserted in the split-Infl area?', the answer is YES: there are many adverbs that will produce ungrammatical results if inserted in that higher segment of the projection. If you try to insert any of the 'low' adverbs of Cinque's hierarchy (e.g., a pure 'manner' adverb) in that 'high' area, it will get the wrong 'scope' and the sentence will be ungrammatical. 

As far as I can tell, the term 'predicate' is used rather differently in syntax and semantics. Syntacticians speak of 'predicates' only when a 'predication' relation - 'primary' (as in Bill came home) or 'secondary' (as in Bill came home rather depressed)- is established with a syntactic 'subject', which may be the (unique) subject of the clause or another NP/DP, in certain cases of 'secondary predication' in which the 'subject' is not the subject of the clause, but an object, or the subject of a subordinate 'small clause', etc., depending on which analysis each syntactician favours (as in, e.g., I saw Bill rather depressed, I consider Bill an excellent teacher, etc.). Hence, syntactic predicates normally or even invariably (depending on the analyses syntacticians adopt), correspond to only one type of what semanticists would call 'first-order one-place predicates', the type in which the argument that must 'saturate' the unsaturated one-place predicate to yield a 'proposition' is discharged, precisely, by the syntactic subject of the clause, but, of course, the undischarged argument of an unsaturated one-place predicate need not correspond to the subject of the clause; semantically speaking, I sent Bill__ is also a one-place first-order predicate, even though the missing argument is, syntactically, not discharged by a subject, but by a direct object (say the invitation in I sent Bill the invitation, or which in This is the invitation which I sent Bill, etc.). In semantics, on the contrary, the term 'predicate' is used much more generally. Of course it is applied in cases of 'functional application' that do correspond to syntactic predications, but also to many other cases that do not. For one thing, semanticists, following logicians, speak of 'monadic' (= one-place), 'dyadic' (two-place), and, generally, 'n-adic' (n-place) 'predicates' (and all are 'predicates', from the semantic point of view). A transitive verb, for example, is, semantically speaking, a two-place (first-order) predicate, although, obviously, it does not by itself constitute a complete syntactic predicate, and a 'ditransitive' verb is a three-place first-order 'predicate', although it would need to be construed with two objects to constitute a complete syntactic predicate, etc. On the other hand, the 'predicates' the semanticist talks about need not be first-order, they may also be higher-order (2nd, third,... etc., depending on how rich the semanticist's ontology is), and, as a consequence, ad-nominal APs, PPs, relative clauses, etc. internal to an NP/DP, for example, are also one-place 'predicates' (2nd order, in this case, since they are predicated of a common, or modified common noun, that is itself, semantically speaking, a first-order predicate), and, correspondingly, AdvPs, PP's, etc. modifying unsaturated VPs also qualify as one-place (in this case, nth-order) predicates, since they are 'predicated' of partially constructed VPs. Actually, 'adverbials', as Ernst and Cinque, in particular, have shown, may be 'predicated' of entities that syntactically correspond to many different types of verbal or extended verbal projections, AuxPs, Modality Phrases, full predications, propositions (with polarity specified), ForcePs etc., etc., which are not first-order entities, either. So, in sum, in semantics, the extension of the predicate 'predicate' is much bigger than it is in syntax.
