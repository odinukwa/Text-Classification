You need to observe all the sensations of your meditation object for making progress in mindfulness meditation. It is normal to have some spill over effects of practice in normal life. If you can, you can maintain mindfulness while interacting with the world as well. If you can't, that is fine, as it is generally considered to be more difficult. So increased sensitivity is normal, and it is result of being open to all sensations during the meditation practice. 

Spectacular as it may be, it is not the final stage or end result of one's insight practice. In fact, some texts like Visuddhimagga refer to it as the beginning of actual insight practice. The long term goal is to use this to reach stream entry, or the first stage of awakening. To get there you might need regular practice and most probably also guidance from an experienced teacher. In the short term, it is better not to hold on to these experiences, as it is transient and not repeatable. The clarity might not remain same and identifying with past experiences can cause added suffering. As clarity fades, you might find yourself in difficult territories, so learning and practicing letting go will probably help a lot. 

I'm going to quote William James again... Its an excellent analysis, my advice is to read the whole piece for (non-buddhist) commentary on volition and self. 

I don't see why an illusion can't be in control of things. Please allow me to quote William James, a highly regarded psychologist from past century: 

When one assumes that self exists, it is assumed to be permanent, otherwise self that is present in two events continuous in time are not the same! Say some action is committed upon expectation of a reward, the self that performs action doesn't get anything in return as the self that experiences the consequences is something else! This leads to lot of suffering as the self that acts doesn't get anything in return and hence any action by it is unsatisfactory. That is not to say that concept of self that one assumes to exist is permanent. It is assumed to be permanent, otherwise we will have a problem accommodating causality or accepting that self can act in pursuit of rewards, as noted above. There are stages in insight practice (starting from bhanga nana or knowledge of dissolution) where one gets direct insight into the impermanent nature of self. No wonder these stages are grouped under dukkha nanas (knowledges of suffering/unsatisfactoriness). 

I'm a bit confused about "not self". How do you take responsibility for your actions if you don't see them as your actions but just a process happening? It is not just a process. It is a result of many interconnected processes that you habitually identify as your self. By seeing the way it actually is, instead of what you think it is, you can prevent yourself from actions that will not yield the expected results. You can correct your actions or create changes in behaviour by taking responsibility for your actions. You can also bring about changes if you understand the processes behind them and see the connections that result in those actions. It is different way of seeing things, not a denial, not abandoning of one's responsibilities. Ultimately every thing is connected by cause and effect, internally as well as externally. You can group certain causes that arise together and call it self, but then if you have to correct any effects arising from that group of causes - you have to tie the resulting effect to that group and try to bring about changes that will prevent the unwanted effect from happening. According to the concept of no-self that is not needed, you can tie the causes to its effects directly and bring about changes, if you realise the illusory nature of this grouping. But Buddhism would seem to say there is just alcoholism (or whatever the issue is) happening and it's not happening to a self. Seems like you are confusing non-identification and no-self here. Non-identification is like when you see anger happening and don't assume that you are getting angry. This is viewing with dispassion. Observation of anatta will certainly help, but it is not required for this to happen. Sure it passes and arises but the same pattern of issues continue to pass and arise and definitely feel like they are happening to me for many many years causing a lot of havoc and unhappiness in my life. How do things like these keep happening and yet pass under the radar ? Because a) one avoids the issue or justifies it, b) hence one doesn't find a proper solution and c) hence doesn't stick to a solution. How does taking responsibility address the issue ? a) It doesn't allow you to make a justification (by definition) b) It helps maintain the focus at the issue so that a solution can be identified and c) Helps sticking to the identified solution. If you view the same issues with dispassion a) There is no need for justification since one doesn't identify with it and b) Frees up more mental resources for identifying a solution. Dispassion may not be of great help in applying the solution, you need to use right effort for that. Right effort includes development of skillful means for reduction of suffering. How do I integrate the Buddhist view into my life and take responsibility for what is occurring at the same time without kind of denying stuff by saying "it's not self" As pointed above, observing no-self or viewing stuff with dispassion is not same as denial. Things can be fixed by either taking responsibility or viewing things with dispassion and application of right effort. 

There are two ways that one can change using mindfulness meditation. First one is by practicing morality and by practicing mindfulness, one can become more relaxed, less agitated and become less pulled into stuff that causes irritation, frustration and the likes. It doesn't take much time to experience this change. Since you are practicing for six years, maybe you have experienced this change, probably you are getting pulled into stuff lesser than before but not considering this as a change as many things still affect you and you still experience (some) negativity. The above change is temporary as it is dependent on you practicing on a continuous basis. The other way to change is to work your way through enlightenment. For the kind of changes you seem to expect, I would say at least till sakadagami (second path, the one after sotapanna or stream entry) as this cuts the defilements of gross attraction and aversion. Stream entry itself can bring lot of changes as it cuts through the fetter of identity view, but for some at least it doesn't change their behaviours fundamentally (It definitely reduces the burden though by bringing changes in perception and opening of dhamma eye and hence makes practice easier). This change generally takes longer time to achieve and there will be phases were things seem to get worse but if you persist this will lead to permanent and lasting change. 

Yes. This is impermanence, at the experiential level. You are getting the hang of the fact that experiences come and go, and they get affected by mere looking at them. There is also impermanence at a deeper or subtler level, where every sensation becomes ripply or vibratory - that can be seen when mind is trained to see impermanence at a deeper/subtler level. edit: I don't know a better term to use than ripply to describe it, anyways my usage of the term comes from Shinzen Young's meditation manual, page 41. (A beautiful illustration of meditation path up to the arising and passing away stage can be found in pages 40-45) 

What you have described sounds very much like the experience of Udayabbaya Ã±ana or the knowledge of Arising and Passing Away. You can search for these terms and figure out more about this. You can also refer to this description of this stage by Daniel Ingram. As to where it came from, only you can answer that question. Something you undertook, like self-enquiry might have resulted in this. Generally these things are unclear at that time but with sufficient understanding of oneself and the world, it can become more clear. Why did it happen? Because it is natural, it might present itself to any one who looks inside. For some it may not happen with years of practice, but for some others it can happen by just looking at things with mere curiosity. There could be various reasons for this, ranging from past karma to genetic differences, but its not worth pondering too much on these as these are outside one's control anyways.
