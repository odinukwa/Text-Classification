Yes, no problem. It's conceivable there could be some kind of exception someday, but so far not that I've seen or heard of. 

Being able to easily compare gearing across bikes with different crank lengths is the main reason why Sheldon Brown advocated switching to the proposed Gain Ratios system for expressing bicycle gearing. Gain Ratios measure gearing in terms of movement of the pedal rather than rotation of the chainring. You can use his popular Gearing Calculator to check it out. The other systems are more or less racer-myopic and force you to do additional math when different length cranks are involved, but yes you've got it as far as how to do so. 

Two reasons, one major and one a little more subtle. Majorly, most adult bikes won't come close to fitting in a standard, non-oversize bike shipping box if you just turn the bars and fork as you describe. What counts as oversize and how much more it costs will vary depending on where you are in the world and the carrier, but you'll need a significantly bigger box and that will generally be more expensive. Second, if you have the fork turned in the box, only one fork end will be contacting the bottom, which will prevent the fork from being able to sit flat on the bottom of the box and will cause loads on the box to have more of a tendency to side-load the fork, the direction it's weak in. The normal way of sticking a plastic fork block in the fork ends which then sits flat against the bottom actually does a lot to keep forks from getting crushed. 

There are somewhat more granular approaches and many more parameters on top of these, but these are the big ones to pay attention to know you're getting into the right ballpark, and will in almost all cases be enough to get you to the right size in a given model's size run. Once you have a good idea of your target numbers, or the range of each parameter that you want to have access to in getting the fit dialed in, you can model each size of each bike you're looking at in a simple 2d CAD program. I use QCad, which is free, and getting the frame geometry of a bike into it from a manufacturer's specs only takes maybe 2-3 minutes once you know your way around. To emulate what a touring bike would give you using more test-rideable road bikes, you will have to fiddle with swapping stems and potentially even adding a riser for the purpose of a test ride. Some shops would happily do that for the sake of a sale, and many would not. A bike fitter with a proper fit machine who has some sensitivity and awareness to riding styles other than racing is also an easy path to handling this. Then you're just dialing the geometries of whatever bikes and sizes you're looking at into the machine and test riding to your heart's content. There is a lot you won't learn about the bikes from doing this, but it is a very good way to learn about one's fit needs, and again it's a reliable way of knowing you're getting the right size of a given model. One of the stumbling blocks with this on touring bikes in particular is whether the steerer comes chopped or not. The norm in the industry is for all steerers to come cut to size to minimize assembly time. On touring bikes where it's more common for people to want high positions, that causes a lot of problems. Some companies, Surly and Salsa for example, who send out a higher than normal proportion of special ordered bikes, send uncut forks with all or almost all their bikes. The important point here is that, especially being tall, you have to know how much steerer you have to work with to get your target bar height. This is true even if you were willing to put a steerer extender on your new bike, which is unfortunate when it winds up being necessary. 

My simple answer is 45 is the point where you're beginning to push it, and you'll get some of the ill effects of narrow rim/wide tire but probably not ever in any kind of critical, deal-breaking kind of way. Pressure, loads, and riding style all factor in - you could probably make bad things happen if you tried with a 45, but generally speaking it would take pretty aggressive riding. What makes it hard to answer is the width mismatch can be pushed quite far oftentimes before there are major consequences beyond the tire being squirrely and riding badly. The big example is how narrow (22-24mm external, sometimes narrower) MTB rims were in vogue for so long in the 90s, paired with up to a 2.35 (although more commonly 1.95-2.1). It wasn't good but people got away with it in very large numbers. Every little bit counts, it's not a negligible difference if you're on looser stuff. FWIW I have wire 41mm Knards I've used a lot on 4 different rims - 1 bike with 22.5-23mm external and probably 17mm internal widths (Mavic T221 front and Sun CR-18 rear) and one with an Open Pro (15mm internal, 20 external) front and a Velocity Dyad (19mm/24mm) rear. The Open Pro felt like it was pushing it and the 22mm rims I can believe they're not optimal on, but it was all totally usable and they perform really well. I believe the main thing here is if you're pushing the mismatch and you're tubeless, you have the consequences of burping air to reckon with if the casing does start to roll. As to the second point, I think part of the answer here comes down to whether if you were tubeless, how low of a pressure are you actually going to go with. I know when I do more loaded gravel rides I tend to not be all that interested in seeing how low I can get away with. My load is some arbitrary number, I'm not going to be spending the time to figure out whatever that sweet spot PSI is, I mostly just want to ride and not get pinch flats. In that context I'd rather have the width, and because I'm not tinkering with pressure, I wouldn't get much benefit from tubeless. But there are other approaches to take. 

These are intended to clamp around the cup itself. Spindles have essentially zero spline engagement to lose. You can't really put spacers under road outboard BB cups. 

Some amount of unworn upper lip on the rotor is normal. For example, when you try to measure a round-edged rotor with a caliper, usually it doesn't work from the outside edge because there's some kind of lip there. The entire brake pad surface should be contacting rotor - in other words, there shouldn't normally be any lip getting worn into the pad. If there were, that would be your real sign that the pad isn't making full contact. But because it can't be totally perfect, it follows that the rotor is wear the unworn spot is going to show up. This one does look a little more extreme than normal, but I think it's fine. The first thing I would do if I suspected a problem is check firsthand that the mount is actually to spec, since it's pretty simple. Use a caliper or even a pocket rule and poke a skewer through the axle without the QR nut to give you an easy spot to measure the center of the axle. Here are the dimensions. If it's not that then it may be a peculiarity of how this rotor is getting along with this brake and adapter. In my experience, even though it's not supposed to matter, you can save yourself some grief by mismatching adapter/caliper/rotor as little as possible, and you've got a different brand for each here. I do tend to be willing to put in Shimano rotors on anything. (Just to be clear, mismatches shouldn't matter and usually don't.) I think part of what may actually be going on here is the pad type used by the HYRD is just a little taller than most or all of the SRAM/Avid pads and it's making it look like the rotor wear is going further than normal into the large cut-out section of the rotor. Up to 2-3mm or so should be fine if you want to try this. I would feel like I was doing something wrong if I stacked them up any more than that in a shop setting. I don't really think it's worth messing with upon further consideration. 

The only piece of it that can kinda sorta be re-used is the cranks. Front derailer cage gap to chain width compatibility is a real thing that matters and affects performance, and your 9-speed wheel won't take an 11-speed road cassette unless it's already an 11-speed wheel running a 1.8mm spacer, or it has a retrofit 11spd freehub available, or it's a Mavic road wheel (basically the same as an 11-speed wheel with the spacer). The far better path is just get a new chain, 9-speed mountain RD, and an 11-34. 

If you have a Fox QR15 thru axle (sounds like it), the only thing that's supposed to be adjustable is the rotational position of the axle nut in its splines, which if needed is done by loosening the 2.5mm bolt that keeps the axle nut keeper in place and sliding the keeper out of the way. To fasten down the axle, you thread it in much like threading a normal QR skewer in the QR nut, stopping when the lever begins to require force when it's about halfway through its travel, or parallel with the axle. You adjust the axle nut's position to make sure the lever ends up positioned how you want it when fastened and all the way down, i.e. tucked neatly in front of the fork leg. 

Shimano often doesn't market or stock components targeted at the Euro trekking market in North America, including these pedals, many cranks belonging to their MTB groups with slightly upsized chainrings, generator hubs, etc. They're on Shimano's Cycling Europe site. Distributors and retailers can generally get any of it specially brought in if they want. 

This is a little bit of a two-layered question. The literal answer is yes. Given no gap adjustability, if your priority was to avoid rub, a hydraulic brake would be more susceptible to having rub, or more difficult to set up without it, for any given amount of rotor misalignment. What makes it more complex is that you usually also have the priority of having it be a good brake. Hydraulic brakes transfer power from the lever more efficiently, so for a given amount of braking power output they can have a wider gap. (In terms of their design versus a mechanical.) This is a subtle point because we're not talking about a much bigger gap, maybe not even appreciably, but it's true that it being hydraulic at least moves the needle in that direction. Mechanical brakes with their pad adjusters and barrel adjusters don't really free you from having to keep the rotor just about as true as true as with a hydro. With most of them, if you back out the adjusters much at all to compensate for rotor warp, the lever is going to be hitting the bar and you won't have much of a brake. It is true that in some cases you are able to adjust the brake in response to slight misalignment and still have it work, albeit with that much more imminence of the lever bottoming. Different brakes, both cable and hydraulic, also have some variance in how much leverage they employ. The more leverage, the narrower the gap but the more power is generated. The less leverage, the wider of a gap (rotor truth tolerance) you have, but less hard the rotor winds up getting squeezed. There are also various systems that change the leverage (aka mechanical advantage) of the system at different points of the brake lever stroke and/or armature travel. There are some mechanical disc calipers that are very gappy and tolerant of poor rotor truth, but they're not good brakes. I believe the department store disc brakes are tending to play this trick these days.
