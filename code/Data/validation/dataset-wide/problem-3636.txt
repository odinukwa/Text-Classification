So yes, it does matter, especially if your goal is to get into the higher spectrum of strength. If you don't have a barbell around and have to pick between suitcase or nothing, rock those suitcase deadlifts. 

Even on a deadlift, which generally has a narrower stance (but certainly not always), I tend to widen up a bit more because it helps me to use my glutes. 

Again, you'll want to read the labels. Try to remember that supplements are supplemental and that if you have a good diet you don't actually need them. Everything you're taking is related to building muscle, and building muscle happens all day and night long. There are small highs and lows here and there but in the big picture you want a steady supply of high quality nutrients including protein. 

Specifically related to Florida, the Journal of Environmental Health had an article which went into some state and regional statistics: 

Being honest with the category you're in is important: training programs are optimized for certain categories. Those programs seek to maximize the benefits of the category and minimize risk. Related to Untrained, here's another excerpt from EXRX: 

A general rule of running is to gradually increase your miles by no more than 10% per week. So a 10 mile week can turn into an 11 mile week. There are a lot of marathon training calendars you can find online that will give you the day-by-day schedule. Often these require shorter (and faster) days on Monday and Wednesday, with a longer and slower run (aimed for distance) on Saturday. One thing I'd really ask yourself is: What Are Your Expectations For Your Marathon? Are you trying to: 

With the exception of a track event, most everything else will have hills. I've heard hill repeats referred to as "speed work in disguise". What they have in common is rather than the steady-state output you can build up on the flats, you need the ability to generate a lot more output, and then recover quickly back to your steady-state maintainable race place. Runners will talk about "cresting", which is that once you get to the top of a hill, rather than slow down and recover, you rapidly resume your faster steady-state race pace. It's all interval training (a.k.a. fartlek), and deals with the fact that real world running requires shifting power outputs and rapid recovery. Not directly answering your question, but another reason to have "fast" days (not necessarily sprinting and shorter distances/time) is simply to learn what a race pace is. If you are running long-slower a lot, you won't get a lot of experience at your race pace. Boiled down, I think these are the main components of training for a distance runner: 

My spreadsheet math below. I tried to follow the idea of weekly compounding 2% gains. I capped the time at 26 weeks for sake of not having an incredibly long image below, but at 52 weeks it gets to 840. 

It's a really good question, and rectus abdominis (abs) was a tough one for me to figure out personally. For a lot of exercises like the deadlift and front squat (and back squat, but so much more clearly on the front) you want to have your back locked into a neutral position. For a demonstration, try locking your forearm into a 45 degree bend at the elbow (halfway between the classic bicep muscle squeeze and being straight armed). You'll notice that your tricep and bicep are both tensed: the cool term for this is that one is a stabilizer and the other is an antagonistic stabilizer. In order to lock your back into a neutral and safe position, so that the muscles are taking the load and not your vertebrae, you need both your back muscles and your abdominal muscles locked, just like your bicep and tricep. Specifically answering your question of What is the proper use of the abdominal muscle to reduce injury?, I'll keep stealing from exrx with this quote regarding abdominal weakness: 

I find that supplements should be exactly what the word implies: a supplement, specifically because you need a certain amount and are not getting it. Strength training athletes generally supplement protein in their diets because they need more and it's simply hard to get the correct amount of protein in a normal diet. The same would be true for anyone who, using peer reviewed evidence, identifies something in their diet that they aren't getting enough of and ensures that they're making up for it. The idea that you (and me, and everyone) actually need 9000x the amount of B12 that you normally get seems really far fetched. Go through and look at foods that are high in that nutrient, I bet you'll see that you're probably covered. And if not, you can make a change to you diet via "real" food before you introduce pills and powders. It's worth pointing out though that there certainly is a middle ground in vitamin supplementation. It's naive to say everyone needs 9000x the daily recommended B12 allotment, and likewise it's rhetorical and anecdotal to trot out the "you'll just pee it out, and that's if it's not bad for you" blanket answer. Keeping on the B12 bandwagon, for those who suffer from aphthous stomatitis (canker sores), there was a 2009 study that showed nearly complete abatement when study participants were treated with 1,000 mcg of B12 daily: 

Basically you firm up your glutes and abs, and get your forearms resting on the ball. Then start moving your arms around. A bit forward, and back. A bit to the left, then back. To the right, then back, etc. Make little circles, make patterns, whatever. It will keep you in that isometric plank position, but provide a much more taxing exercise as it works a lot more angles as well as your obliques. 

Eccentric (lengthening of a muscle) causes strength increases, but if it was more valuable than the concentric (tightening) activities people would just sit around doing negatives all day and then show up and bench 1000lbs without ever having pushed the bar off their chest before: it's ridiculous. I'd answer your question by saying that there are three ways that eccentric exercises have a clear place: 

You need to train for the specific exercise. Your body has specific adaptation. If you train at high reps, it will develop endurance because you're not using full strength. If you work at full strength, your body will develop strength and not endurance. Pullups will not have a lot of bearing on your bench. The two are related and you absolutely need to develop your body in a balanced way, but if you want to bench more you need to bench more: no way around it. Two pieces of advice I'd give you: 

He would do his run, eat breakfast, and fall back asleep. Then he'd spend the rest of the day doing calisthenics, sparring, bag work, and eating. Most of Tyson's training was at the hands of Cus D'Amato, and you can read up more on the training plans he had for his fighters. 

You (probably, based on your fitness as explained) could do 20 pushups a day, every day, and have no problems. However if you tried to push your 1RM (single maximum effort) bench press, you would not be able to do it again tomorrow. If you can, after you lift enough and get strong enough, you won't be able to. Eventually if you continue to get your strength high enough, you won't be able to repeat your maximum lift twice in a single week. Basically the stronger you get, the more damage you can inflict on your body. Granted you get better at adapting, but not at the same rate. This diagram below shows it a bit: 

I don't think a high or low bar squat should necessarily cause knee pain: both are okay when performed correctly. As such, I wouldn't look at that as the cause of your issue. The low bar squat is "better" because you can push more weight. There are a lot of competitive level crossfitters that never low bar squat: their knees are fine. Regardless of all of that, work your back with deadlifts, rows, and pullups. Stretch the front of your chest. When you build a bit of meat up on your back and can push your shoulders back the ridge will be there. Even for people with decent back muscle, the low bar position can feel weird at first. After a while it becomes pretty comfortable, especially as the weight gets heavier. 

I'm looking at my progressive intermediate weight training program, and I'm a little more than halfway through my 12 week program. As expected it's been terrific, I've steadily been gaining strength in all areas, and I'm PR'ing every week. But if I'm able to squat 300 (3RM) right now, and I'm going to keep chugging away at the intermediate program schedule, a 2% weekly increase means that in 52 weeks I'd be squatting 840lbs (I did some quick Excel math). So my questions would be: 

I had a tough time learning cleans, but they're really awesome to master and unlocking the olympic lifts feels like getting accepted into a barbell fraternity. As a frame of reference, watch this youtube on a slow motion of clean and jerk. 

Bulking and cutting is a staple of the body building community, and on forums primarily devoted to aesthetics you'll find a lot of information supporting them. Although less commonly talked about, the cycles of bulking and cutting fit quite nicely with anabolic steroid use. With something like deca/tren, a 12 week cycle is normally used, and you'll notice that most bulking cycles are usually in the same time frame. It's naive to think independently of steroids and body building: they've been coupled together for a long time. What you won't see are a lot of long-term healthy and strong people (3+ decades) who are constantly bulking and cutting. Body building techniques (like bulking and cutting) are optimized for short term gains and by nature focus on aesthetics. It's entertainment, but from body builders the Hodge Twins even put their two cents in on the damage of constantly bulking and cutting. Personally, about ten years of training for strength sports I've gotten to this realization: 

I'm sure in a round-a-bout way they do since they're both compound arm/back exercises. But the angles are pretty different, the inverted row targeting the traps a bit more so than the pullup (or chinup) which targets the lats (and biceps, if you're doing chinups. Inverted (or supine) rows I generally recommend as a warmup for back exercises, or for folks who are pretty new to training. Once someone can do barbell rows around ~100lbs I'd grab the barbell and toss some 25's on. A general problem with bodyweight training (like supine/inverted rows) is that you can only really only change up reps and sets; the weight stays constant. Pullups/chinups are in a different category because they are terrific exercises, so adding weight (chain belt, plates hanging off) just makes them that much better. Inverted/supine rows though don't really need to be weighted since there are superior exercises (cleans, barbell rows, etc). If you want to take negatives and band-assisted off the table, I'm sure you'll eventually get to pullup status by continuing with what you're doing. I have a hard time seeing someone who can do 100 near-horizontal inverted rows not able to knock out a single pullup. 

As a guy who has a financial interest in the supplement industry, I can tell you where you're getting that message from: supplement manufactures and retailers. The idea is to make you think that unless you consume a given product you won't be maximizing your "gains". 

I would not regard that author as focusing on strength. Instead, her experience speaks to "weight loss and wellness" camps, where the need for a rigid trunk during maximal and near maximal exertion is not necessary. What probably is worth highlighting in a weight loss camp however is proper breathing, since it's primarily an aerobic (with oxygen) affair. To be fair, the debate is still on with the Valsalva Maneuver. A 2006 study studied it a bit and summarized: 

Two of the programs with a lot of following are Starting Strength (website / book) and Strong Lifts 5x5 (website). Whichever program you follow, the Starting Strength book is worth its weight in gold. Both of these programs are built for novices, which should be defined by strength standards, not personal opinions. They focus on compound barbell exercises. Once you get into the intermediate phase of strength (again, as defined by standards), you can look into other routines designed for trainees at that level (Texas, Madcow, 5/3/1, Westside, etc). Don't be eager to jump from novice to intermediate: progress slows down the stronger you get. Leaving a novice program that you are making solid progress on to move to an intermediate program will slow down your overall increases. If you don't have access to a gym, consider a body weight program. If you go that route, consider a suspension trainer or (harder) a pair of gymnast rings. Also, a couple of kettlebells can take you far. These options won't be anywhere near as effective compared to a progressive barbell program, but certainly better than nothing. 

Track your calories for a week or two with something like myfitnesspal or dailyburn. Focus on reducing the carbs, upping the protein, and scattering food throughout the day every few hours. Low carb induced ketosis combined with smaller high protein meals means I can go weeks without ever feeling hungry. Get your diet nailed down and the energy level will take care of itself. 

There's nothing fundamentally different about strength training between men and women, most of it just revolves around some techniques in the beginning until you're able to handle the full bar. 

You may want to consider switching shoes. Running is basically managing overuse injuries; that's the upper limit that keeps you from just going out and doing 20 miles of speedwork every day. I found that switching shoes was enough to change some dynamics enough to give certain injuries a break and allow me to keep knocking out miles. It's not a magic bullet, but it can alleviate some issues and give you some cross reference. When you switch shoes, make a big switch. If you run in minimals, use trail runners. If you're in trail runners, try some Nike Free 3.0's or something of that ilk. If it's coming on during your run, it's not DOMS, the keyword in DOMS being "delayed" and that time period usually being 24-48 hours. No one is going to diagnose you via the Internet, but trying a different shoe seems pretty reasonable to me. 

Unless you have some rather specific reason to do otherwise, I'd recommending shooting for 3 sets of 12. Both with dips and pullups, I've seen good results making sure you can do a lot of reps (10-12). When you want to target strength specifically, you might drop that down to 5 reps. On an intermediate program I have good luck doing 3x12 on one day (Monday), then 3x6 weighted on another day (Friday). 

In my personal experience, "maximum heart rate" is a bit of a wildcard but the Mayo Clinic describes it as: 

Anecdotally I've used smaller ones and bigger ones and never noticed much of a difference. The bigger and fancier ones, honestly, are generally just about marketing. Instead of buying the $9 one at Target, you can buy the $59 version that has a ripped model on the front and some thermoplastic spokes in an Ⓐ anarchy symbol. I've noticed that higher hand positions make it easier in fact. You can see this if yourself if you do ring rollouts. From that linked website: 

Moving around a weight room has caused more injuries than training has, for me. You can trip, people leave crap strewn about, and as you mentioned it's easy to drop a plate. Shoes won't protect you from a falling 45lb but they'll probably prevent or at least greatly minimize a stubbed toe. Something stupid like that can sideline you for a week. Walking around a squat rack all woozy from heavy lifts is just begging for smacking your foot into something. Specifically related to moving plates around though, I try to approach heavy plates like I would any serious lift. Keep the plate close to your body, grab it with two hands, and don't get lazy-tough-guy trying to hold two 45's. Take your time. Keep things organized and clean. If you're strength training you have enough time between sets to straighten up the plates. Pro-tip for unloading deadlift plates: use a fractional or 2.5lb tiny plate as a "speed bump", rolling the inner plate onto it, which will lift the outer plates in the air. Repeat for the other side until you're just left with the interior plates (135lb if they're 45's). It's a good question though. Similar problems develop when people finish squatting then lazily walk back to the pins and lean forward at the waist with ~300lbs on their back, trashing their lower backs. People take the lift seriously, but then revert right back to lazy-dangerous mode. I actually find stuff like this a side (and real world) benefit to strength training: you learn how to move heavy things around. I tried to pick something up the other day and nudging it around figured it was about ~150lbs, something I would never try to lift unless I had my game face on and was in proper form.
