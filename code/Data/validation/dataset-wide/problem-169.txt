The short answer is, although Stack Exchange is wonderfully designed and extremely useful, it is not a model for utopia because there is no such thing as Utopia. There can not be any utopian society without unlimited resources and information. Since humanity is limited in knowledge and power, that can't happen. There can be no utopia because one man's heaven is another's hell. When people try to create Utopia, they create a special kind of living hell and millions die. Names like Pol Pot, Stalin, Mao, Kim Il Sung, and Hitler were made famous by trying to achieve a utopia. The dreamer says "If we just would eliminate these people here, then we will be in Utopia!" 

Zombie, Vampire and Werewolf myths are all loosely based on Rabies which is a much shorter biological reach. That fungus is particularly adapted to infect specific ant species, and you have to go from that all the way to humans while rabies already does some of what you want and it works on most mammals already. In humans, that fungus' intrinsic workings would have to work on fundamentally different: 

It's a scary fungus with incomprehensibly complex interactions, but ants are far simpler than humans. Perhaps rabies gets some DNA from Ophiocordyceps unilateralis or vice-versa. One could never hybridize the two because one is a virus and one is a fungus. 

If the government were to start a population program where couples sign up, are selected on basis of intellect and achievement and receive training. The selected couples are provided funds from public coffers equal to the expense of raising children for each child they have. The parents are celebrated as heroes, selflessly giving up much in order to ensure the nation continues, all while receiving a stipend, exemption from military service and huge tax discounts. In short order, the population rate would be much higher than it is now with much less resentment than a forced solution would provide. 

Saltgrass has not been mentioned yet. It grows in salty water, and excretes solid salt from it's leaves. Additionally, livestock can graze on it. After much experimentation, the culture follows the following recipe: 

Wow! So many answers without mentioning any of the positives that women bring to the table. To be clear, there are feminine men and masculine women and this answer deals just with the advantages of typical and stereotypical women. Endurance Many answers have claimed without justification that women have less endurance than men. The truth is, women have plenty of endurance for the purposes of military activities. In fact, women hold all of the records for super long distance swimming. Risk Taking Behaviors Since women tend to take fewer risks, one would expect said fighting force to more rapidly evolve tactics that involve avoiding stupid risks, much as modern (after 2000) warfare is much less risky than its World War era counterpart. Culture Military culture has long suffered from toxic masculinity. There are real positives when soldiers obey without question, but creating that outlook is often just a high stakes power struggle. One might expect more good ideas to filter up the ranks in an all-female military. Equipment Smaller soldiers need smaller boots, smaller flak jackets, smaller weapons, smaller meal portions and smaller camp accouterments. The idea that a military wouldn't right-size their equipment for their soldiers is ludicrous. Fewer materials means lower costs, so each soldier will be able to travel just as far or further for a marginally lower logistical cost. War by Other Means War is kinetic diplomacy. If a country is more worried about its daughters going into battle than it was about its sons, one would expect the balance between diplomatic, espionage and military spending to find a more intelligent distribution. Babies Every military has a minority of war fighters and a majority of medical, administrative, logistical and research personnel. There's no reason that soon and recent mothers cannot carry out lower risk tasks during the 18 months per child that a pregnancy takes. 

In a world where there is no antibiotics, no surgery, no dental care, no false teeth, no refrigeration, no stable food sources, and danger at every turn, death came quickly and often. A scratch could lead to sepsis. Food could turn in the hot sun and lead to food poisoning. Starvation, war, plague, and violence were constant companions. 

The easiest way to hide is in a crowd. In a lifetime measured in eons, I assume there would be much job churning. After spending 1,000 years in biology, someone might get bored want to play in astrophysics, chemistry, or culinary science. This is key to how we hide in the crowd. Phase One Identify a remote and uninteresting place for the experiment. This should be somewhere that is out of the way, in a unpopulated portion of the galaxy. Being so far from the action helps to ensure that nobody will stop by and discover the situation as it really is. For the first few eons, nothing interesting is going to happen which would cause the society to notice the experiment. This gives them time to work on phase two. Phase Two While the experiment is 'cooking' on the remote planet, other members of the conspiracy make strategic career moves, some even getting into the survey group. Phase Three When the civilization becomes known to the wider society, the conspiracy members are in management. They assign other conspirators to 'survey' the planet, whose reports are boring, run-of-the-mill normal. Phase Four Here is where we run into a problem. If the experiment grows too successfully, grows too powerful, the conspiracy will not be able to obfuscate the truth. The biologists must have a plan to cover up their fun times before getting into trouble. A device which triggers a supernova would work, although it may cause questions. This could be an interesting plot point, where the experiment are fighting for survival. 

So many answers... A fun thought is that since the wood was once living, the virus "re-animates" the wood and grows a tree if it finds the right part of the vampire's body (the heart). Since the tree was so much more massive than the vampire, the energy required to re-animate the vampire gets sucked into growing the tree and the vampire remains motionless. It could make for a good sequel - the blood forest or whatever. 

Excavate a large flat basin that isn't too deep and holds water after a high tide goes back out. Run a flat channel from the basin inland towards the town. Plant saltgrass in the estuary and the channel. Harvest salt from the salt grass. Take sweet water from the point furthest from the ocean. Occasionally harvest and replant the saltgrass and feed livestock with it. Every few years, remove silt from the estuary, re-grade the basin and dredge the channel. The soil from these endeavors will be high in organic content and likely valuable. 

The first test would be simple survivability test (e.g. Does a living creature survive the transport?) Upon emergence from the other side, the animal is euthanized, and autopsied. The scientists would do an in-depth analysis of blood, tissue, and structures. They would repeat this over and over until they feel confident of what changes taking the trip has on the animal. Then they would have the animal pass through multiple times and autopsy it. This checks to see if there is a small but cumulative effect on the animal. They would do this with different animals (rats, monkeys, pigs, dogs, fruit flies, etc.) Each animal approximates humans in some areas better than others. (note on animal testing) The researchers would keep some animals alive to study long-term effects of passing through. Here they are looking for any differences between a control group and the test animals. Specifically, they will examine the differences in the rates of death, cancer, infectious disease, and chronic disease. They will do blood tests, and look at organ function. They would compare aging, general health. I would expect a trained animals would be kept to see cognitive effects (how fast rats run mazes, etc.) I would also expect researchers to keep a population of fruit flies to ascertain what lingering effects transference might have on reproduction, fertility and the germ-line (i.e. future generations.) Fruit flies are used because they are small, cheap to keep, well-understood, reproduce quickly, and model human DNA well. If the tests indicate that the device is safe, humans would then go through. They would be tested extensively. Of course, external pressures like economics and war tend to shorten the deliberative scientific approach. In cases such as this, testing would still occur but with less repetition, and a shorter time-scale. 

It sounds like you want a situation where the disaster of a volcano is imminent, and so manageable as to be routine and not a disaster. Bad news, it's not a disaster. Agreeing wholeheartedly with Will, pyroclastic flows blow things up. Here you should read 'things' to include, especially, shield volcanoes. Since water is the usual ingredient in causing a pyroclastic flow on a shield volcano, you're doubly safe because the atmosphere is really boring 50 miles up - it doesn't rain on Earth even 5 miles up. If you did, somehow, manage to have some sort of highly porous rock that connected an ocean to a lava flow, and manage to keep not only that flow going uphill, but not going so much as to destroy your preposterously high volcano, you have another problem. You've minimized the size of the pyroclastic event which means that the volcano erupting 450 km away is barely worth talking about - the fiery, noxious gasses will be dispersed, cooled, and somewhat neutralized by simply existing in the atmosphere in view of the sun. If, instead, you're worried about lava (which is far more likely, given that it's a shield volcano), tons of people live really close to active volcanoes, but your volcano is huge. If lava managed to flow for the hundreds of kilometers from the caldera to the edge where humans lived (wildly unlikely), the odds of a human seeing the flow are minuscule unless the humans literally ring the entire volcano, including the riverbeds where the lava is likely to flow. In other words, your volcano is too big to make the disaster routine and imminent. 

There can't be more than one omnipotent God unless, like the Christian concept of the Trinity, they exist in perfect Harmony (although, Christians believe in one God existing in three co-equal persons.) Omnipotence means that all non-contradictory things can be accomplished by the deity (for instance, God can't make a married bachelor or a square circle.) Omnipotence means that the being always accomplishes His will. Two beings mean two incompatible wills. 

The best examples are from nature. Hookworm is transmitted by the larvae burrowing into the feet (or other exposed skin) and entering the bloodstream. They get into the lungs, gets swallowed and get into the intestine. Brainworms are transmitted by infected gastropods getting ingested along with leaves. The larvae then migrate into the central nervous system. Pork tapeworm eggs are ingested and can migrate directly to the brain. Edit: As pointed out in the comments, the OP said the parasite was too large to use the circulatory system. While I would assume that the larval form would be much smaller than the final parasite form, it would seem that the nose, into the frontal sinus into the brain would be the easiest path, followed by entry at the back of the neck. The parasite would then enter through the Foramen magnum. However, anything too large for the circulatory system is going to be large enough to be noticeable as it burrows in regardless of where. 

Dropping In the weeks to hours before birth, the baby resides lower in the abdomen - a transition that physicians call "lightening". A hypothesis has been advanced that a baby won't drop without gravity. On the surface, it seems to have merit, but babies drop while expecting mothers are in a variety of positions. In addition, dolphins appear to have a similar phase, so at the very least, mammal babies can drop without gravity. Earth women have exercises and movements which hypothetically move the baby into position, but while that research appears to be in its infancy, there's no reason to avoid talking about the zero-g versions of the same exercises. Gestation Humans carry babies in their wombs surrounded by hydro-static pressure. Since Earth women do yoga, swim and sleep, it's pretty clear that their orientation does not effect their ability to bring a baby to term. For women to need gravity to bring babies to term would require proof. Copulation Again, nobody wants to admit to having had sex in space, but humans are endlessly creative when it comes to this. I will not be adding a link. Evolution Nature will find a way. There are few things that cause rapid evolution in "natural" species, but illnesses and breeding problems are at the top of that list. Nature is neither fair, nor kind about this, so there would be some cruel generations where natural selection takes care of this problem. That could have it's own consequences because our powerful brains are related to the long gestation times. The other option would be to guide evolution with Genetic Engineering, but that tech is probably a long way away. Verdict If you want it to be an issue, you can, but I wouldn't bat an eye if a fiction writer told me that zero-g birth was commonplace and about as catastrophic as Earth birth.
