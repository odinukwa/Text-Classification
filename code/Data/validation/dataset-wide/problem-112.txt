Fallout isn't Death-Magic Radioactive fallout only lasts like 6 weeks at dangerous radioactivity levels. The biggest issue is strontium-90 in the soil taking the place of potassium in the plant's growth cycle. This can be dealt with pretty much at leisure after the fallout's 6 week half-life (as little as 2 weeks, as many as 8 dependent upon blast proximity). Then you just scrape the soil layer contaminated with strontium-90 and re-seed the area with potassium. Strontium-90 would be out of the environment on its own after a few decades, so you really just need to treat an area big enough to grow food in and let time handle the rest of the countryside. Strontium-90 is only hazardous if ingested, so your fallout cleanup crews would pretty mush not have any need for anything heavier than a regular dust-mask, nor would they be needed for anything outside of the immediate area planned to be used for growing. The closest thing to physical differences such people would have would be a higher than usual instance of cancers and possibly some level of increased instances in birth defects. I'm sorry, but your whole story idea depends on radiation basically being magic. Fallout basically takes care of itself after a few weeks. 

Game is Rigged Bullets move to quickly to jump in front of, one can only really try to anticipate what the shooter is aiming at and try to get there before he fires. This means there has to be a high level of choreography involved, since a shooter can always re-aim and fire faster than a contestant can possibly react to it. It Much like the trick of people catching an arrow. The arrow catcher is actually involved in a close agreement with the archer who will fire predictably at a certain velocity and range and at a specific target. It is not actually a feat of quick reaction skills so much as the two working together to ensure the arrow is in the same place at the same speed at the same time every time. Likewise, your gladiators are not REALLY anticipating the shots, their shooter is actually just shooting them, they simply move around to provide the illusion that they are anticipating the shots. Accidents and lapses in marksmanship occur, but by and large the contestants are simply mimicking the ability to jump in front of a bullet. Next, the bullets are intentionally of a low caliber and a low velocity to ensure that the gladiator can actually do anything after being hit by one. They also must wear some sort of armor, not necessarily enough to totally stop the bullet mind you, but enough to prevent internal organs from being damaged. It would be a very short and unsatisfying blood sport for your sadistic viewer to watch if the guy just gets shot and keels over. The only parts of the body with enough mass to reliably catch a bullet contain critical organs, and you cant puncture those and still remain agile enough to appear as if you were jumping in front of bullets. Knowing this wont even change viewership. Everybody knows that on WWE guys aren't really hitting each other in the skull with chairs and baseball bats. Doesn't change viewership. Plus your guys are still actually being shot at and actually being injured and executed for failure, its just rigged to make it actually survivable. The event is not fun to watch if the chances of winning are too low, at a certain point its no longer a sport and just an elaborate execution, believe it or not those become pretty boring pretty quickly when they are a regular event. 

Tightly Cramped and Optimized For Minimal Crew It is ironic that in space the one thing that is extremely cost prohibitive is space. This is because life support is very power-hungry, high maintenance and delicate, so you want to have to use as little of it as possible. As well, food and water is heavy, cannot be reduced to take up less space past a certain point, and is one of the biggest determining factors aside from fuel as to how long and how far a mission can go. To counter this spacecraft need to be optimized to fit as much as they can into as small a space as possible and to utilize as few crew members as possible as well. A control center for a space vessel is probably going to be packed with machinery and have only as much space is required to fit a few crew members in a seated position. It will probably be deep down in the center of the vessel where there is as much armor as possible as well. There wont be any windows, since in space combat will be occurring at thousands or even millions of kilometer distances and there really isn't anything looking out a window could help out with. You would probably have a seat where a pressure suited crewman is manning communications, navigation, and steering (probably heavily assisted with automation.) Steering the vessel will not be a dramatic joystick hauling "pull up pull up!" affair because maneuvers in space can take hours, days, weeks, or even months. The navigator will simply execute a series of computer commands which the computer will then carry out (like increasing acceleration 2% for the next 8 hours to optimize the effect of an upcoming gravity well slingshot.) The next would be the engineer's station where he is seated to monitor the ships mechanical functions, fuel level, engine status, damage reports etc etc. The third would be the gunnery station where somebody operates the ships weapons, also probably heavily assisted by automation. Keep in mind the engineer is not a "scotty" who can whip up battlefield repairs under fire. Any actual repairs the ship will need are going to have to involve a spacewalk and wont be able to be done in combat or while the vessel is accelerating or maneuvering. All personnel on the vessel will probably be at least capable of assisting the engineer. The next is the captain. The idea of a captain sitting in a big centrally located chair behind and above everybody gesticulating dramatically and trading verbal tirades and witty barbs with bad guys on a giant screen video chat is not going to happen. The need for a "captain" is going to be a bit different that tradition naval vessels. He will probably be a subject matter expert who can assist with any of these three guy's duties as needed or take over if somebody dies or is injured In combat. This is unlikely since anything that hits them will probably kill all of them or damage the ship badly enough to render such measures meaningless. Still, its good to have contingencies available since a crewmen can just as easily get killed or maimed during the ships downtime on accident. The captain will probably be seated into the now very cramped Control center to ensure that all personnel are operating optimally, convey mission orders, and generally assist with the operations from his command console as well as assisting with tasks when things get busy. It will probably look an awful lot like a space shuttle cockpit minus the windows. Everybody will be packed in like sardines and only have as much space as is required to operate their station and get in and out of the control center. A war vessel will probably only require 4 people to operate in combat, and will probably have 3 to 4 times that number tops. These are Replacements for when battles or operations end up taking weeks or months and members need sleep but the ship still needs to be constantly crewed in case a surprise pops up. This is a watch rotation which ensures some redundancy in crewing and also ensures nobody is manning an armed war vessel after being awake for 72 hours. Things change dependent upon the ship's function however, I am former military so I can tell you a general idea how combat operations work, but dont know a hell of a lot about stuff like transport missions or scientific expeditions. Civilian ships will probably have a bit (A weeeeeee bit, not much) more room, and carry more crew if they are performing something that requires more manpower and long duration's of time sine scientific expeditions could take years and even basic cargo runs could take months. But the life support sections will always be fairly small and make up a small portion of the ship in total. Realistic spaceships are mostly fuel and engines with a tiny payload and habitation section relative to the size of the amount of fuel required to accelerate and decelerate it all. The size of a ship is not related to the size of it's control center. A massive ship can still be controlled from a tiny heavily armored room nestled deep inside the armor and superstructure of the vessel. A cockpit like this could control a ship the size of a cruise ship. 

In Afghanistan we sometimes took over abandoned buildings as patrol bases and sometimes constructed our own. Its all dependant upon what the intended purpose is for the base and if there is already a suitable building where you need it or not. If the purpose is to provide overwatch and support for regular patrols into a wide valley to prevent weapons smuggling then it was getting built on top of a ridge overlooking the area. If the purpose is to provide a headquarters for patrols moving amongst the populace of a large town then we were probably just going to take over and retro-fit an abandoned building for our purposes. Retro-fitting an old building vs constructing a new one is entireley dependant upon whether there are any suitable buildings present to retrofit or not. 

Small or Single Purpose Vessels are Doomed Large Multi Purpose Vessels: In combat one has to assume that if something can go wrong it will, and then prepare a plan that allows you to succeed even if the very worst happens. In this case each and every single ship arrives by itself spread out over a long time period leaving each and every single vessel launched totally without support or able to give support to another. This means that each and every ship needs to be capable of being completely self-supporting in as close to every way possible as can be manufactured. I am envisioning mother ships with any smaller support vessels they need to have attached to them. These Mother Ships are part factory, part warehouse, part command and control, and equipped with a truly devastating amount of weaponry. Smaller Battle-Riders Fighters don't really work in space, were talking about full sized combat vessels that arrive attached to the massive command ship. After it arrives outside the enemy's defensive envelope they detach and form a screen around the command vessel to increase defensive capability and prepare to launch sorties into enemy held territory while recon is gathered. Drone Swarm Manufacturing Part of the command vessel's manufacturing capabilities involves creating vast fleets of autonomous drones which will be sent into enemy territory first in attack constellations. They are intended to draw fire from defensive emplacements and locate enemy combat assets and force disposition within the battle space. They are not fighter craft, again, because of physics fighters just don't work in space. These drones are armed, but they are not going to be jinking and dodging and swooping. They are intended to be scattered everywhere from hell to breakfast within the enemy battle space and detect and attack enemy defensive emplacements. These drones will be at least armed with nuclear weaponry and multi-megawatt lasers. If they are destroyed before firing its not a complete loss, the larger vessels watching from afar now know where one more enemy asset is located. If it can detect and fire before being detected and fired upon another chink in the enemies defenses has been opened up. Should any survive they can continue monitoring enemy positions and activity like spy satellites and act as an auxiliary com network if needed. Assault Begins After all this has been accomplished the smaller vessels can begin moving into the system to assault enemy forces, exploit gaps in the defenses created by the initial drone activity, and generally make it safe enough for the command vessels to begin moving into the system to finalize the assault and consolidate their hold over the system. Ideally you would have all or most of the command vessels and their assets available to participate, but each command vessel acts as it's own fleet and is capable of independent operations. This is less than ideal however and the goal should always be to coordinate between these battle groups so that they can provide mutual support and cover, and so that reserves can be held in the "rear area" outside of the enemy defensive envelope should the need for reinforcements or to repel a counter attack arise. Consolidation of Victory These command vessels are so monumentally powerful, large, and versatile that once a system has been conquered they can act as system defenses if arrayed about the system so that long-term expensive projects like building their own defenses. traditionally forces are most vulnerable when they have recently won an assault, being prepared to defend what you just took is just as important as being able to take it. The automated manufacturing facilities within these ships can begin mass producing the things needed to turn the system into a fully defended staging area for the assault on the next system. These factories can build other automated factories and collect resources to fuel this construction. By the time everything is said and done your ships are repaired, the conquered system is fully defended and you are ready to pass it off to arriving rear echelon defense forces as your newly repaired, refueled, and refitted command ships prepare to jump to the next system and do it all over again.
