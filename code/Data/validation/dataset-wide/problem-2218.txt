On June 6th, 2017 Scooter Gennett hit 4 Home Runs to become the first Cincinnati Red ever to do so. Who are the other people who have hit at least 4 HRs in a single name? Please provide name and the date of the occurance 

The fastest man ever, Usain Bolt, world record holder of the 100 and 200 meter sprints suffers from Scoliosis. This is a condition which causes curvature to the spine. The curvature in his spine has cause his right leg to be slightly shorter than the left leg. I've also read about other sprinters with lower reputation who also had Scoliosis. For example a Canadian national sprinter used to run third in 4x100 relays to "take advantage" of his uneven leg lengths in the curve. Is there any links between Scoliosis and leg length differential and sprinting performance? Has there been a study on this? 

Captains from both teams meet with the referee before the game and the visiting team calls the toss. The winner, chooses to either kick the ball/receive the kickoff or an end to defend at the start of the game. 

Brazil just lost 1-7 to Germany in 2014 World Cup. What is the biggest loss ever among the top 4 teams in a world cup (that is biggest lost in the semifinals, 3rd place match or the final match)? Did this game have the biggest margin of victory? What game had the most goals? 

16 teams make it to the playoffs each season, 8 from each conference. Until a few years ago, within a conference the number 1 seed would face the number 8, number 2 would face number 7, 6 vs 3, and 4 vs 5. Under the current format, teams face division opponents. Each conference get 2 wild cards. The top seed of the divisions play the wild cards, and the 2nd and 3rd ranked team within each division play a series. Then there will be a division championship followed by the conference championship. Eventhough the current format promotes divisional rivalry, it seems very unfair. As of March 27 2017, the top 3 teams of the NHL - Washington Capitals, Columbus Blue Jackets, Pittsburgh Penguins - are all in the same division. This means that one of the top 3 teams is guaranteed to be eliminated after the first round of the playoffs when the 2nd and 3rd rank teams of this division face in the first round. This also allows for lower quality teams to enter the playoffs in the weaker division. So given the above argument, I'm wondering why the NHL has stuck to this format? I can understand they wanted a change and came up with this system. But the system is clearly flawed. So why doesn't the NHL come up with another scheme or revert back to the old format? Note: I say "clearly flawed" since there is a huge difference in the strength of the teams playing in the postseason. The league is trying the maximize the parity of the teams getting and moving forward in the postseason. But the current format benefits weak divisions and disfavours strong divisions. Back to my example, with a very high probability one of the 2nd or 3rd best teams in the NHL is guaranteed to exit the playoffs in the first round. There has been a long discussion whether any team in the Atlantic division really wants the 1st position. The division winner will most likely face New York Rangers, the Wild Card from the Metropolitan division who have more points than any team in the Atlantic. Hence finishing 2nd in the Atlantic division gives the division champion a much easier road to get to the Stanley Cup final. 

There is a chance that Germany and the Netherlands will play for 2014 World cup, so here is a related question. the How many times two teams from the same continent have played the World Cup Final game? Please provide the year of tournament and the countries playing the final game, also indicate the champions :) 

When is a player said to be a rookie in North American major league sports? My understanding is that a rookie is a player that is playing his first professional season. But for how long is that player considered to be a rookie? I have heard many times a player being discussed as a rookie even though he was in his second year. So is a player called a rookie only in the season he starts (I don't believe that's the case), or until he has played as many games as there in a full season, or for some other length of time? 

The Las Vegas Golden Knights have made it to the Stanley Cup finals in their first year in the NHL in the 2017 - 2018 season. The Knights have broken many records for a first year expansion team to make it to the finals. Another remarkable feat is that they are the top seed in the finals against the Washington Capitals. How long did it take all NHL expansion teams to host the opening game of the Stanley Cup finals? If a team hasn't done so, indicate how many years it's taken them to get to the finals as the lower seed. And if that hasn't happened either, just mentions wha't the furthest they've made it in the playoffs. 

Hockey goalies wear glove on one hand to catch the puck. I've seen the goalies freeze the puck by putting their glove on the puck when it's on ice feet outside of the crease. What are the goalie limitations to use their glove to freeze the puck or catch a shot? Where can the goalie not use is glove? 

What is the record for the most love serve games in a tennis match for men and women? In tennis the word love is used to represent 0 points in a game. So by love serve game, I mean a server game won without dropping a single point. 

The last successful fair catch kick was made by Ray Wersching of San Diego Chargers. The kick seems to be so old that a footage of it can't be found easily online. But here is a video of attempted fair catch kick with rule explanation from Dean Blandino the NFL's Vice President of officiating. 

Tennis players are allowed to challenge line calls when the hawk-eye technology is available on court. Upon a successful challenge, I've seen the point getting reversed in some occasions and replayed in the others. When is the challenging player awarded the point on a good challenge? 

Related to this question, I'm wondering how many times in MLB history a team has hit home runs on consecutive pitches. That is 2, 3, or 4 home runs in as many pitches. Please provide the team, date and players hitting the homers. 

Can you please list all pitchers who have hit a home run in the history of MLB playoffs? Bonus: Include position players who started a postseason game as the pitcher and hit a homerun 

read this $URL$ It explains the system FIFA uses to asses points. There are many different multipliers, but if you read the section titled Match status you'll see that the the points of World Cup matches are multiplied by 4, where Continental cup matches are multiplied by 3, cup qualifiers match points are multiplied by 2 and friendly matched have multiplier 1. 

At the beginning of many prime time NFL games, the starting players say their names and the college they attended. Why are the college names announced? Many of these players have been in the league for many reasons, and may have even played in multiple NFL teams since they left NCAA. So what is the reason behind mentioning the college names? Do the colleges sponsor the NFL or the broadcasting stations for this? 

Under the current format that 6 teams from each conference make it to the playoffs, how many times has a #5 seed hosted the conference championship game? In order for the #5 seed to host the game, both the #5 and the #6 seed have to upset their higher seeded opponents in the wild card and the divisional round. So an equivalent question would be how many times the #5 and #6 seeds of a conference have met in the AFC or NFC championship game? 

Inspired by the deflate gate and Ezekiel Elliott's now halted suspension, I'm wondering how the NFL can legally suspend players for off the field behaviours. Are there clauses in the contracts and CBA that specifically mention such situations? In the case of Ezekiel Elliott, he didn't even get charged by the police for domestic violence (please correct me if I'm misinformed), so on what bases did the commissioner Goodell suspend him? 

This is done for the same reason they cover the genitals. The velocity of the ball can get very high on a free kick and if it hits a player in the face it can break his nose or even teeth. Also notice that many of these guys have had their noses broken before and had surgery to fix the broken nose. So they definitely don't want to go through the pain and process again. Covering the chest is usually done before the kick. The player who does that doesn't want to block his own vision before the kick, so keeps his arm by his chest. So if the ball is shot towards his face or neck he can cover his head immediately, to avoid getting hit. 

Has there been any male or female athlete who won medals in multiple disciplines during the same Olympics game? If so, list the athlete's name, as well as the year, and the disciplines of medal winning. As bonus, also list any other discipline if the athlete also participated in that year, but didn't win a medal for. To clarify, I consider sport programs to be of different discipline if listed so here for each of summer and winter games. 

Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal are the only men's majors champions of 2017 so far. 35 year old Federer won the Australian open and Wimbledon, and 31 year old Nadal won the French Open. There has been this trade of dominance by older players in tennis in the recent years. Similarly, the women's side had been dominated by Serena Williams before her maternity leave. The other male top seeds, Andy Murray, Novak Djokovic, and Stan Wawrinka are all 30 years of age or older. Murray and Djokovic are 30, Wawrinka is 32 years old. If one of these top seeds wins the US open, then all grand slams of men's singles in 2017 will be won by players who are at least 30 years old. I'm wondering how many times has this ever happened in the men's and women's singles? 

I've heard analyst say that a player has been under performing as a batter in the heart of the order many times, or that a bottom of the line up batter has been doing well for its position as of recent. This makes me believe that each batter in the line up has a specific role. Or at least there are certain league-wide expectations for each position. From what I have noticed, it seems that the heavy hitters are usually in the middle of the order. Also it's obvious that the lead off batter should have high on base percentage (OBP) to increase chances of scoring more runs. Having said all of that, what are the general characteristics of each batter in the line up?
