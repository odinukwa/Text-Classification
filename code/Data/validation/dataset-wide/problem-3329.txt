Rhotics aren't a special case here. They will still either be deleted or be replaced with the sound that is perceptually (to speakers of the receiving language) closest to the original sound. English's /r/ [ɹ̠] is similar to /n/ and /l/ among others. For example, in the Algonquian language Innu, English /r/ tends to be replaced by /n/: 

The work on this question is recent and has potentially plausible mechanisms underlying it, so watch this space. 1 Though one could imagine that other factors are involved. For example, in English the shapes of the letters that make up these words could bias round/spiky associations. A person could visualize the letters even without seeing the word written. 

Notice that the last one requires a few qualifying predicates; I can't even say Catholic or identify a single country they went to, at least by name. And it might still not be enough for you to realize that I mean the Jesuits. Even worse, we may not know the same things about them. You might think I mean some other set of missionaries because you don't happen to know how many continents the Jesuits have been to or in which century the society was founded. Moreover, we might not even agree on a predicate. You and I could talk about "the greatest English writer" and I could be talking about Shakespeare when you mean Ian McEwan. Those are the cases that would be harder to write. Incidentally, even proper nouns aren't always enough to do this job. If you address "Luke" now, we know you mean me. But if there are two people named Luke in the room, you have to say "Luke S." or "Luke A." But what if a person's full name isn't unique? Say there are two people named Luke Sawczak. Now you have to fall back to the same strategies shown above: "The Luke Sawczak who was born in Canada" or "That one there"... and in sentences like those, the name looks awfully like a common noun, not a proper noun. 

The word that interests me the most is the last one podes which is pronounced in rapid speech something like "pɔdʃ". Could the last sound cluster "dʃ" be considered an affricate, or is there a requirement that the affricate be entirely voiced or devoiced? 

However the following verbs are not subject to the rule because the theme verbs are short, marked with a caret. poner (ponĕre), cocer (coquĕre), beber (bibĕre), meter (mittĕre), romper (rumpĕre) 

In the First, Second and Fourth declensions, Nominitive Plural is the same as Genitive Singular. The other two don't follow the same pattern, but don't deviate very far from it. Even in English, we say: 

As the other poster indicated, accent is the application of native phonology to another language. However, if someone grows up speaking two languages, they would necessarily have less of an accent than someone who speaks just one language. Two languages necessarily have a larger phoneme inventory than just one, which means the speaker has more native phonemes to choose from. The perfect example is from Portuguese. In my experience monolingual Spanish speakers have a really hard time pronouncing European Portuguese sounds, particularly the reduced vowels and opened variations of E and O. Whereas English speakers have trouble pronouncing rolled R and reduced consonants such as the approximates of B, V and D. In my experience, students who grew up speaking Spanish and English do wonderfully learning the Lisbon variant of Portuguese. In the case of Mandarin, from what I've heard the Chinese usually classify foreigners differently. Since that language is so unrelated to Spanish and English, typically they just say someone had a Western accent, which it is usually not easy to determine the origin. 

The organisation of the consonant and vowel tables of the IPA is an approximation of the place and type of the phonemes' articulation. Hence the columns are arranged in order from left to right according to place of articulation in the mouth from the lips to the back of the throat, and the rows are sorted according to their manner of articulation by increasing aperture, from the most closed articulation to the most open, which is why it starts with stops then nasals, then fricatives, then the others which necessitate to open the mouth more and let the air flow more freely. Indeed, if you read Saussure's Cours de Linguistique Général, you'll see that to him, vowels are merely further than consonants on the same aperture continuum. This understanding is now probably a bit dated, but it's not completely wrong either. 

Here are the names for the eight cardinal directions in Estonian (top) and Finnish (bottom). Lule Saami also seems to have eight noncompound names. However it does not appear to be true of all Saami language. 

As pointed out in the etymology you give, "figurine" is ultimately a borrowing from Italian, through French. Therefore, it is in Italian that you'll find the diminutive suffix -in- meaning "little", as shown in the following derivations : gatto - gattino (male cat - kitten) viola - violino (viola - violin) concerto - concertino I highly doubt that this suffix is productive in English, but as you can see in the second and third examples, there are other examples of this suffix in borrowings from Italian. 

Stepping off of the airplane in Lisbon, I could immediately hear that the pronunciation was much different from Brazilian Portuguese, which I am more accustomed to. The level of vowel deletion was so pronounced in fact, that I almost thought people were speaking Polish, due to the high number of awkward consonant clusters - such as brzydka or ptaki in the Slavic language. The four most striking and frequent examples I personally heard were: 

The second vowel alternation rule is a general lowering of theme vowels for mid height root vowels, where the first rule does not apply. 

If those verbs had a long (or doubled) vowel in Latin as their theme vowel then they were most likely going to be pronounced with a wide e - or a wide o - in conjugations where they retain the tonic stress. In the following examples I'll use first person singular i.e. Eventually those wide mid vowels became and in Spanish, because Spanish phonology does not contain wide mid vowels. Some simplifications are going to be made here, but here are some etymological timelines: 

In Portuguese there are two accepted reasons vowels in verbs alternate in height. The vowel harmonizing rule states that where the theme vowel (a from -ar, e from -er, and i from -ir) is deleted from the conjugation and retains tonic stress, the root vowel is changed to match the height of the theme vowel.. 

I am currently trying to learn Tamil. My friend who is teaching me seems to be making a clicking sound with one word in particular, and she can't seem to tell she's making it. The word is குளம் pronounced as [kʊ˞ɭʼʌm] - meaning pool or pond. Every time she says it my mind is blown when she transitions from the retroflex ɭ to the ʌ. The distance between these two sounds seems to be the maximum possible distance it can travel between two sounds. It's as if the tongue is slammed into the floor of the mouth causing a click-type sound. About 50% of the time she says the word I can hear a distinct click. I'm wondering if any phonologists out there have noticed these kinds of unintentional click sounds in any languages. Also, at what point would a click serve some sort of contrastive phoneme? Is it even possible for a language as old as Tamil to develop clicks?
