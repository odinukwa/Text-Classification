Old mobile phones You may think I'm joking, owing to how brittle mobile phones nowadays are and the fact that they usually have round corners, but we have tons of it, and I mean it literally. Each year as Apple and Samsung release the next best thing since sliced bread and the last phone, countless obsolete phones are thrown to garbage heaps, we have so much of it. They don't degrade and even a broken phone will still maintain its general mass and shape. Back when NOKIA was the king, phones were made even larger and larger before they shrink, those phones are thick and can withstand a lot of abuse, they can be laid down as roads and do a good job as one. For more modern ones, which are pretty thin, they can be used as personal self-defense projectile, it doesn't hurt like an arrow, but can disorient the occasional wild dogs, and is a better choice than throwing kitchenware at thieves 

Yes but not in a way that is useful for your story. Jupiter has permanent storm systems circling the planet, so it's definitely possible. Unfortunately where one storm system ends another begins. The storms on Jupiter are also orders of magnitude stronger than the storms on Earth. Furthermore even modern technology wouldn't be enough to cross a storm of that magnitude. It's a cool idea though. I don't thing your readers would begrudge you handwaving the storm's existence if it makes for a good story. 

Religion by it's very nature is prone to schisms. There are no examples of a religion on earth of any longevity that hasn't split and factionalized. This is such a common phenomena that it's possible that it is a fundamental part of human nature. If it's impossible for religions on one earth to not split constantly. It's going to be impossible for a religion spanning multiple earths to do so. To quote xkcd: 

Why not use magical ink? I mean, you say that the "energy" has to be stored somewhere, but there is no real limitation on what it is. Magical inks can be used to scribe incantations in a book, and as you use spells the ink evaporates (or disappears, because magic) and once all the ink in the book is gone, you're toast. Everybody can carry a book, be it a journal, a recipe book, a law reference book, or something else, it doesn't stick out You can write on the book back at home, so it's rechargeable. The magical ink can be made of various substances and therefore have a variety of inks with different amount of energy stored in each, say, milliliter or something. The production and sale of this ink could be regulated by the Mages Guild or something. A book is naturally lightweight and everybody can carry a few. The richest of the rich can buy the most powerful inks with a lot of energy stored in them, so they only need to carry a thin book instead of a few. Example: Suppose that there are 3 tier inks: Standard, Premium, and Ridiculously Strong. The standard of this tier is how many Fireballs one can expect to be cast. The mechanism of magic is that you write the incantation on a paper and as you use the energy in it, the ink evaporates, causing the text to appear more and more translucent until it's gone. The incantation used for testing has a standard size, typeface and boldness. The standard of energy used to count the Fireball is each Fireball should be able to burn a 200 grams raw beef into a medium steak in 1 blast, not medium-rare, not well-done, but precisely medium-rare. About 5% margin of error is acceptable. So say that Standard ink can cook 3 beefs before the ink evaporates, Premium can do 6, Ridiculously Strong can go 12. The entire energy can be spent in an instant of big blast or used very sparingly in a small flame that it lasts way longer. Suppose that the incantation of Fireball is the word "fireball" written in lower caps, and a standard sized paper can hold the word "fireball" in 4 columns and 12 rows for a total of 48 standard fireball words, using a standard ink will allow you to cast 144 standard fireballs before you run out The poor and inexperienced will need bigger and more books to hold all the inks in case their spells miss or they went overkill too many times, the experienced can go with fewer and smaller books 

Memes don't exist in a vacuum. Like a bacteria or a virus they need the right host to settle in. For instance when I play Rick Astley's 1987 hit song Never Gonna Give You Up to my 90 year old grandmother, she remarks "What a nice song." without any of the groans and grumbles associated with being rickrolled. Since as a time traveler, lacking cultural context, you're probably not the ideal host for most memes. Now it is possible that an ideal translator would translate the speech acts in such a way that the context is perfectly translated as well. If your translator is 99% accurate it's probably not preserving context well enough.* 

No a facemask isn't sufficicient to protect a human like being from the vacuume of space. First off such a contraption would only provide breathable gas. That is only one of the functions of a space suit. Such a suit would provide no protection against the vacuum of space, or the extreme temperature differentials experienced during a spacewalk. Since they are exposed to a breathing gas there will be a positive pressure in their lungs. To contain this positive pressure requires a full space suit. When Joseph Kittinger's was glove failed to pressurize during his balloon jump, it swelled up to twice it's normal size and caused him debilitating pain, taking 3 hours to return to normal size. 

This has already happened today in the form of dialects. Take, for example, me. I am an Indonesian, I live in South Sumatra, where the language are quite different between the city, the towns, and the areas in between. Neighboring provinces e.g. Jambi, Lampung have similar language but a bit different in terminology, the people of South Sumatra, Lampung and Jambi can speak to each other using their own tongue and everyone would be able to understand much of the conversation. I live in the capital, Palembang, with its own language Palembangese, but my dialect is modern Palembangese, which are Palembangese mixed with Indonesian, by quite a lot. So much so, if you speak formal Indonesian, you should be able to generally decipher what I'm saying, although not perfectly. This language was developed by the younger generations with access to formal Indonesian. When I speak with an actual Palembang citizen speaking the original Palembangese, I can't make out what they say, their terminology is very different, sometimes they use a word that I know but for a completely different meaning, but the general structure, the general grammar, is similar. In these cases, basic grammar would help, as you would be able to figure out subjects, objects and verb, only not what they mean, the rest would be learning the vocabulary like a new language, because in a way, that's what it is 

1500 years ago old english was just starting to be a distinct. Now it's mutually unintelligible with the its modern form and the languages it's closest related to. That's with 1500 years of close contact, trade, and diplomacy between each language. It stands to reason that if you want your much more isolated settlements to be unable to speak to each other that's an entirely plausible assumption. It could also be possible that much less linguistic drift happened, medieval Icelandic manuscripts can still be read today by modern speakers of the language. Pick what makes sense for your story between these two extremes. 

There is still a gravitational force (a slope) at a lagrange point so that an object with no velocity would still fall out of position. 

There is always a logic to how towns are organized. Oftentimes the logic is mostly convenience or inertia. If there are existing stacks of shipping containers for instance people are probably going to rig up walkways for easy access. Once human traffic has work a path, other people are probably going to build alongside instead of disrupting the flow of traffic. Shantytowns tend to occur where there is a lack of a conventional authority. Without that building codes go out the window. Houses will be built cheaply out of whatever is available. People still have needs and ideas of personal property. Once I've built my house I'm going to be righteously pissed if you want to plop a shipping container on top of it. There tends not to be a centralized governmental authority, and if there is it's probably looking the other way. There may be enterprising individuals who own property and lease it to whomever is willing to pay. The odds are high that organized crime is also involved.
