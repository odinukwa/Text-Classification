So, while this doesn't directly offer a rigorous philosophical answer to your question, I suggest that it proposes a more useful pathway to establish a place where your question can flourish. Unquestionably, there are epistemologically sound answers that philosophers have proposed to this question - I don't know them - but then answer to your question won't be found there. Think about the paradox of it - if you were to read an answer to this from a renowned philosopher - Heidegger, Hilary Putnam, etc. - you would find yourself with a new gap between what is possible to understand about this topic, and what you already understand. In receiving your answer, you would be reintroducing the dilemma that necessitated the question. What is possible is mastery. Mastery as I understand it is a process; a process where everything undertaken seriously becomes ripe with possibility. Because, there is no top to this mountain called knowing, everything can be looked at freshly. Everything is new and not known, and everything is a potential source of learning. Knowledge is a side effect of the pursuit of mastery. In areas where I have any degree of mastery (there are maybe one or two), I find that almost every new thing I learn leaves me knowing considerably less than I did before I learned it. Now I know that thing (to whatever degree I do), but a whole new heretofore unseen world opens up in front of me with new things that I don't know about the world of what I've just learned. Pragmatically, the distinctions could be drawn better than I have. Perhaps the next answer will do that. 

So we spend a lot of time worrying about what we ought to do and what we ought to not do - following our current whims and beliefs about what is right and what is wrong. Driven to act, it is often our ego dictating what we ought do or not do. If we believe x, are we morally bound to act upon x, and what must we do? Often acting from this context, we will end up doing more harm than good, and become fixed on our beliefs, certain that what we are doing is right. One need look no further than Twitter to see how dangerous that can be. 

There isn't understanding as you distinguish it. Your distinction is too sharp. Imagine Roger Federer's understanding of tennis vs. a college tennis player's understanding vs. mine (not so good). There are degrees for this. Taking your example, at a certain level, I suppose, it is possible to have a very solid understanding of an automobile, but then there are people like the guys on Car Talk - they have a sophisticated and refined level of understanding that most people will never achieve about cars - or anything else - their entire lifetime. One thing I have heard stated is that: 

The bolded cannot depend upon the virtue or vices of a person insofar as we are willing to apply a blanket statement that torture is unacceptable. As soon as we say that torture is unacceptable - and support this statement with the argument that torture turns a human being into a thing - we are immediately tied to the reality that follows from "a person is not a thing". If a person is "not a thing", a person then is not an object, but a subject: meaning they exist in such a way that we cannot seperate our experience completely from their experience; and thus cannot treat them as merely a means to an end without objectifying ourselves as well. Martin Buber spoke upon this brilliantly in Ich und Du (I and Thou): 

Though on a surface level, the parallels are subtle, after investigation, it becomes clear that the idea of no-self is embedded in both Samsara and Eternal Return equally. In both instances, there is an experience subject to past actions ( when are past actions created? ), and that experience repeats eternally. There is no self experiencing Samsara that is separate from Samsara. The illusion of Samsara is perpetuated by desire as an endless cycle of grasping and rejecting; of becoming and termination. In as much as one is at odds with the present moment - either by craving or suffering the consequences of previous actions - one experiences the self as an entity separate from the flow. The cessation of desire is achieved in Buddhism by cutting off desire through negation ( though negation is but one method in Buddhism ), and with Nietzsche, by amor fati. With amor fati one is not afflicted by desire as one loves their fate and embraces the circumstances of a given situation regardless of how bad it is; as such, they wish to change nothing. In that space, one simply is - and as such, that is-ness is not separate from the flow. Nirvana is Samsara. 

For Heidegger, this is not so. Some of his philosophy could be summarized as saying - There is Being and Being is unconcealed in a particular fashion in accordance with certain phenomenological constructs. For example, 'Being and Time', perhaps his magnum opus, attempts to understand Being in terms of the relationship between Being and Time. Throughout his work, Being can never be found as having some SELF that exists independently of the relationship between Being and the clearing that provides a context for Being to occur as it does. In some ways this is similar to Dependent Origination (Prat카tyasamutp훮da) in Buddhism. In addition, per Wikipedia: 

Think about this for a second. If your life disappears immediately after it ends, and more rigorously, if each second of your life disappears immediately after it ends, then everything you do is inherently meaningless. Important Sidebar: ( Kundera argues (and I agree) that this meaningless isn't necessarily negative, but instead allows for one to enjoy life without adding the "unbearable burdern" ). If nothing we do repeats, we - in a certain way - don't exist. We are in constant flux and have no permanence. We are not bound to the significance of our own ego, because it is weightless. Consider the shame suffered by a Victorian Era woman who got pregnant out of wedlock. For her that shame was likely a crushing burden filled with suffering. How important is it now? Since her life doesn't return, the shame is gone, forever dissipated into nothingness, affecting no one. Now - the opposite: 

If we are to accept that we ourselves have value, then the value that we possess is not tied to what we have accomplished. It can't be, because what we have accomplished can only be assessed as valuable within the context of a subjective experience. To a rock nothing has value. Or everything does. It doesn't matter. What is valuable in us then must be somehow correlated with our abilities as subjective beings to experience a reality that includes one another. In other words, when stating that a human being is valuable, we must a priori say that human beings are valuable. This is also stated in your quoted text: 

It is in fact possible; and in a certain way - (I'm not arguing for this) plausible. Consider each word in this paragraph - they are composed of letters that are composed of (in this case) pixels - that are composed of .... well, it's turtles all the way down ... but at some point you get to nothing. Now, given that there is nothing that can be composed of nothing, the fact that nothing exists underneath everything could make possible absolute non-existence. Next point. There is no "thing". What we call something is merely a convenience. Calling a "bird" such does not begin to capture the essence of the thing. It is more like a linguistic straight jacket imposed on a mass of fluid particles. There is no "thing" in the universe; all so called things fail to have any individual existence, but instead form in a congruent dance with other "things" in their space (the Buddhists call this Prat카tyasamutp훮da or "dependent arising"). Given that there is no thing existent that one can point to separately, it is possible that there is no existence that can be pointed to. Descartes is often used to invalidate these thought experiments; but Descartes has done nothing but demonstrate that even his reasoning begs questions. Descartes could not escape the fact that he was there thinking. But this is merely a corrupted conclusion. There were sentences floating about in nothingness (remember what a sentence is made of) that coalesced into a point that called itself "I". "I" decided it was doing something called thinking; and "I" represented itself as having existence and the power of observation. "I" also believes it is the source of thoughts; independent from the thoughts themselves and also independent from "me" (another invention of "I"). Given that "I" doesn't in any observable way exist temporally, its existence at all proves very problematic when considered rigorously. Indeed; whether or not anything exists is not something resolvable (or askable or answerable for that matter); but the question itself illuminates the difficulty one would have in proving the opposite.
