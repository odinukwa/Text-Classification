As a supervisor, your niece can always pull rank, and ask them to talk in English. What impact this has depends on: A. What relationship she has with them. B. Are they doing any cribbing compared to just talking about stuff. Your niece could also look at it as a challenge, and learn the language. Apart from making the team feel nice, it also creates a situation where the fact that your niece cannot speak the language is clearly emphasised to the people speaking it. 

Legal Angle - I personally would not go down this road. Reason is two-fold - doing so might not be legal (you would need to check separately for that). Worse, it would spoil relations with the team. Unless, you are in a rule-based union shop, I don't think spoiling relations is a good idea. Personal Angle - I have been in a few situations like the one described above. (I can speak three languages, and understand a fourth, though not converse too well in it.) In one situation, I was with some people whose first language was my fourth. In the other, I was with some people who spoke my first language. In all these situations, my experience is that is there is no language like your first language for comfort (for the sake of reference - English is not my first language though I am quite fluent in it). 

If your wife is unemployed, meaning that you have a need for her to get a job, you might consider asking your direct boss, or the person responsible for the new customer service hire, depending on the size of the company, and how familiar you are with people around. 

While I think that you could contact them again to say that you are physically available again, I don't think that you should propose a face-to-face interview. You don't have all the details of the hiring process. Maybe they don't need another interview. Maybe they are waiting for some budget, maybe they already have someone, etc. While you can be active to arrange details, the decision to have an interview or not lies with the hiring company. Not the candidate. 

Talk to your boss. Your boss can only manage when he gets the info. For whatever reason, he might not have realised the increase of workload, and the weariness you have. It's perfectly ok to tell them. If you don't want to be too abrupt about it, start by asking what are the perspective for the new hire. And if you don't want to appear as complaining, don't complain, simply keep to the fact: you have a lot of work for you to handle and you're not sure you'll make it. If you're really overloaded, your boss might prioritize things, or find other resources to, temporarily, take part of it off your shoulder. If you wait until the last moment, and don't make it, it would be much worse and take out any chance for your boss to think about an alternative solution. 

This is a good responsibility to take up and prove that you have managerial skills apart from technical ones. Just be careful not to rub people the wrong way, or to lose your technical skills in the process. 

Make full use of this. When you go looking for your next job - which maybe some time away - your title will matter. At the same time, don't get pushy with your new company. 

One way to look at these conflicts is to pretend (takes time and effort) that they are merely technical problems rather than the personal, ego-based issues that they are. Assuming you have the time or can take some out, call get everyone's inputs, and tell them you will take a decision based on the respective merits of the library. Option A: If having two libraries is not a maintenance issue (the code does not give you too much trouble) simply let both lie and tell both people concerned there are many more important things to do - discuss pending Quadrant II deadlines here. Get them involved in those. Option B: Let both people that you are looking at cross-domain skills, and you will decide on a library - but the person who has earlier worked on the library will not be the one doing the implementation, the other person will. This is slightly nasty, but should tempers cooled down pretty fast. For the long run, create the impression that you do not want to discuss specifics, are not interested in personal arguments - but do want to help the person grow as a whole. They will eventually stop complaining. In general, never literally get into a fight between two subordinates and take sides - as in when it is actually happening. 

You're essentially down to the same path that anyone who wants to learn something in their free time. If there are no internal experts look for them elsewhere. The following are the best resources 

Though, from your description, Trish sounds to have some issues, I would venture to guess that the reason why she was a upset, was due to a breach of confidence. She might have felt that she could talk to you about anything, anytime and that you would be there to listen. But then she discovers that you don't keep her information to yourself but that you share it with other colleagues and/or friends. Confidence expectation are always something complex, often expected but rarely outspoken. From what you previously described of her, that realisation might have given her a feeling of treason. And she reacts impulsively. So now to your actions: 

And that really depends on the audience you want to reach. People who would be familiar with the kind of work you've done would expect to see a certain amount of details. For those who aren't (HR?) would not appreciate, might misunderstand, and would essentially frown on that amount of information. So you should keep the name of the places, dates, research centres, etc. But try to see how that experience is relevant to finance. Why does that experience make you desirable in finance, compared to someone who did not have that experience? And, the best would be to get to layman's language... but financial language would be very good as well. It shows you are already projecting yourself on the job. Avoid: 

Maybe some things aren't meant to be a "learning" opportunity. Rather it is what it is and there is nothing to be "learned" from it. It sounds like your manager is telling you to take the "chillax" approach to things. So the IT department can't handle your request. That sounds great. Just tell that to whoever requested it. Just say, "Hey, I just submitted something to IT and they're saying I have to give a reason to fit the goal of the company. Here's what I said..." Then just chillax. Your part of it is done. I would say bureaucratic nonsense is hardly a "learning experience" because everywhere is different. I suppose you could "learn" something by it. First, don't expect anything immediately and think of it like oiling a really jammed up gear. Just slowly drip oil in it, and eventually it'll loosen up. Might take a long time, sure, but the most important thing is not to get frustrated by it. Just slowly keep at it, and slowly things will start moving. It sounds like your boss is cluing you in that things aren't suppose to move fast just yet so you shouldn't worry too much. He didn't say you were doing a bad job, just complaining about it too much because you want things done too soon when it isn't suppose to. 

I honestly don't think it is relevant to list Undergrad degrees when you have a master. I would just list the masters. The part about you pursuing a phd is quite important because it would tell a employer that you plan to pursue it and potentially limit your work schedule and/or work at different hours. 

The problem here I think is with the word "office". Try to change this to something else. You could try Manager, Growth or something else. I think going into jobs, a title that talks Business Development is more likely to be appreciated than others. 

The first thing to understand is that you are in a good dilemma. Being made redundant, and having to be unemployed create stress on the mind. Hence, it was logical on your part to take the job offer. Note that had the first company valued you highly they could have made you an offer at market rate. I am guessing that the reason you were able to close a better offer so much faster is because the first offer was below market rate. Having said this, morally and legally you are not liable to continue with the company just because you have spent a week with them (I am presuming there is no contract that you have signed). You should politely, and professionally inform your reporting manager that you have another offer in hand and would like to leave. If at all, your manager wants to discuss (don't bring it up first), you should give him the chance to negotiate and counter offer. Companies behave like rational agents when making offers, because their stakes in it are often quite low. You need to focus on getting the best career and job that you can. 

We all love some gossip, but they can be harmful to the subject. While it's reasonable to ask some help to deal with it, I would recommend to avoid doing it in written form. She may behave like a 3-years old child, but she's a grown up, you're not her mother, if she decides to leave, let her do it. It might even be good for her, for all we know. Clarify with HR the whole situation. But you're 8. HR probably know how you behave usually, so I would not worry. Never, ever again, leave your computer unlock when you aren't working on it. Especially if you have potentially sensible documents on it. I have heard/read about people being fired for exactly this. (Even if, hopefully, rare). Don't use your professional mail for personal discussions. While often tolerated, it is usually not allowed. And your professional mails are often stored, meaning they might be fully accessible to your boss and/or the IT. 

So you would consider something possibly illegal to retaliate for a situation that you misunderstood... That's probably going to come off worse on your professional image than having misunderstood the situation. Being fired isn't an easy thing, and working to the end of it, isn't much better. You might want to read your contract and all written documents (the only ones that count) to get a better grasp of the situation. Yet you have only few options:
