So this gives us an upper estimate of seven languages, including Mandarin, of which Zhang at least had some basic working knowledge. As for actually speaking though, the number is likely to be smaller. 

Based on the article "The Third Amendment: Forgotten but Not Gone" by Tom W. Bell, I strongly suspect that the answer is "no". According to this article, troops were quartered in private U.S. homes during the War of 1812 and on both sides of the Civil War. In neither case did Congress pass laws to authorize the quartering. 

Peter Laurisden mentions "seven priests" among the first detachment that left with Bering from St. Petersberg in 1733. On the same page he also describes a "list of names of those engaged", but I am unable to find this list. 

West Berlin wasn't just shut off to the Allies, it was under total blockade. Quoting from the relevant Wikipedia article: 

So claims that Jews were something like 40% of the party, which did circulate at the time, were pure fabrications. In Germany, Hitler and the Nazis pushed hard on the idea that Communism and other left wing ideas emerged from the supposed racial degeneracy of the Jews. I cannot find any hard numbers like the above to support the idea that Jews were in fact disproportionately represented in Germany's left wing parties. It must be said that none of this is objective evidence in support of anti-Jewish racism. Given the oppression faced by Jews in Tsarist Russia and the rest of Europe, it should hardly be surprising that they may have been a significant part of the base for left-wing movements. 

It's quite possible that other maroon societies were isolated for decades or longer, but I can't name any well documented case. 

Not every thesis has a single antithesis or opposite. However, we can highlight a few trends or schools of thought in historiography (the study of history) that contrast most sharply with the Great Man Thesis. One such answer is implicitly given in the question itself: historical sociology. The early sociologist Herbert Spencer directly critiqued the Great Man theory. A key theme that sociology, anthropology and other social sciences share with history is the question of structure versus agency. The Great Man Thesis is an approach which strongly emphasizes a specific form of agency, in contrast with more structural approaches. Within the field of history itself, perhaps the most explicitly structural perspectives are that of the Annales School (for example see Fernand Braudel) and of Marxist historiography (for example see Eric Hobsbawm). Another way to look at this question is that the Great Man thesis emphasizes the roles of heroes and leaders. In that sense, the opposite approaches are social history and "people's history". The work of E. P. Thompson is a good example here. He is definitely not a structuralist, but instead emphasizes the agency of the working class. 

Reform Judaism does not view the Sabbath as irrevocable holy day and the movement which started mid 19th century grew considerable so that your remark "they were indistinguishable from non-jews European people and led similar lives outside of religious matters" is only valid for this branch. I would even say that the integration and non-conspiciousness of Jews in the modern world (they still follow many rituals and traditions, so you can recognize a Reform Jew if you are a good observer) is only possible with the creation of Reform Judaism. Saturday is therefore not a problem for integration. As reaction the ultra-orthodox Jews (Haredim) were moving in the opposite direction which means separation from other denominations, denial of the modern world and strict observance of Jewish law. The Haredim did not integrate into the western world at all and their distinctive appearance means they are very easy to recognize. The relationship between Haredi and Reform Judaism are for this reason a bit...strained. The rest of the Jews who were more conservative, but would not decline to participate in the modern world are the Modern Orthodox branch. They try to balance the observance to traditional laws and the requirements of modern life. According to the 1990 National Jewish Population Survey a majority of 78% Orthodox jews consider themselves Sabbath observant. 

The usage of using numerals for division neither existed nor was it necessary. Symbols were only used for recording results. This also explains why the romans used their system because it is easy for recording. Big numbers first and easy to remember symbols for the different steps of 100,50,10,10,5,1. The operations itself were calculated by an abacus. 

After Black Tuesday and the Great Depression it finally broke down. Unemployment rose to unprecended height. It was shown that the political system of the Weimar Republic was critically flawed. The Reichstag (parliament) was not able to work because both left and right parties had enough votes to stop progress. Hindenburg had the power to dissolve the Reichstag, elect the political leader ("Reichskanzler") and create emergency bills ("Notverordnungen"). And he abused this power to its full extent. If someone wants to insist that Germany in the last three years from 1929 to 1932 was a stable democracy: Ferocious streetfighting between communists, nazis and goverment supporters was a daily occurence. In fact, each of the factions had their own hit squad: The KPD had its "Rotfrontk√§mpferbund", the goverment its "Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold" and the nazis the "SA". While the German election at March, 5th 1933 was during the time Adolf Hitler was already in power and the opposition was hit hard by the draconian persecution for the alleged arson of the Reichstag (and therefore the election cannot be called "fair" by any means), the NSDAP got 43,9 % and the DNVP 8% with a voter turnout of nearly 89%. They build a coalition and were therefore able to get the absolute majority with nearly 52%. They persuaded the Zentrumspartei to push the Enabling Act through with the necessary 66% majority and legally installed the dictatorship. 

According to the Online Etymology Dictionary, Anatolia is simply "the ancient name of Asia Minor". However, here is some helpful background on the different origins of the two terms. In theory this could be seen as implying a different definition for Asia Minor, but in practice the terms are synonymous. 

The earliest relevant usage in any English language source that I could confirm via Google Books was Somaliland in 1783. According to the Online Etymology Dictionary, the term Somalia dates to 1814 and is of "unknown origin". So Somaliland appears to be the "original" English name, but was rarely used until later on. The terms British Somaliland and Italian Somaliland appear together in Parliamentary records published as early as 1851: 

TL;DR: Roughly around the 3rd century AD, because Christianity. Here is an article that briefly describes the historical development of ancient Egyptian mummification practices, including their decline. 

As far as I can tell, this traces back to oral tradition and so you are unlikely to find any precise record of when the drought or judgment occurred. But the judgment is specifically attributed to Umar, and he was caliph from August 634 CE to November 644 CE. 

Any hunting depicted in medieval art is likely to be by members of the nobility, regardless of whether they are wearing armor or not. The website of the Metropolitan Museum of Art describes the use of armor for hunting as "rare". 

There was indeed a shortage of labor as suggested in the question. Even captains deserted ships in search of gold. Many of the ships were decrepit to begin with and knowingly sent to San Francisco on their final voyage. Wood was in short supply and expensive to mill, as evidenced by the prevalence of canvas tents as the primary form of shelter. This added to the incentive to use a ship for scrap. Scuttling a ship was the easiest way to make a claim of land on shore, a practice known as "hulk undertaking". The ships for which prices were quoted above were purchased for this purpose, which the source describes in detail. 

Total estimates for the number of people displaced by World War II are at least as high as 60 million. The question is how many of these displaced people crossed international borders. I'm not sure, but it could easily be in the millions. So the share may be small, but still significant. Here are a couple of specific figures I am picking out of an excellent book on the history of global migrations. This is not a comprehensive list.
