I've never had this specific benefit, but my wife has. She's worked at the same company as long as I've known her, and the privilege seems to have been slightly modified every summer, but the general concept is that Fridays in the summer have modified hours. Some years have meant that every other Friday is a half-day. Other years meant that they can leave an hour or 2 early every Friday. And some years, the benefit was not offered. The only way to know what the specific benefit means is to ask. 

One other reason I have found is external recruiters want an editable version of your resume for several reasons. 

To echo, some of the other answers, the further back you go, the less someone cares, so it may be perfectly acceptable to estimate to the best of your knowledge (but this could depend on the individual company and may not be acceptable to all). True story from my own experience... I applied to a company I had interned with 13 years prior (a Fortune 500 company with very strict hiring processes), and I actually had the wrong dates for the internship on my resume. I had the months correct, but I was off by an entire year. I repeated that error in my background check as well. And no one even questioned it or asked, and I was hired without issue. In fact, I didn't even realize the mistake until I applied for an internal position 2 years later when the internal application pre-populates your internal positions. So you should try to be as accurate as you can, but when you get past the last 10 years, it becomes less important to be 100% correct. They hiring manager is more concerned with your experience. 

I have been looking for a job for the past several months and it is getting close to the time when I believe companies could be making offers. I have had (fortunately) over 5 face-to-face interviews in the past two weeks, some code exams (I'm a developer), and phone interviews, and it has occurred to me that I may be in the situation in which I receive multiple offers in the coming weeks. What is a way to gracefully handle this? I don't wish to sound greedy but due to my financial situation I would like to hold off on accepting an offer until I know I can take the offer that pays the highest salary. I'm thinking right now that it would be a good idea to mention to companies when they make an offer that I will carefully consider their offer and respond promptly with a response. Offers are valuable; no job is guaranteed. However, it seems foolish to accept the first offer I get because I'm scared there will be no others. 

I would say message him and ask him politely if there was a way he could type and move his mouse a little more quietly :) it might even be a way to get to know him better. Alternatively, you could play it safe and just dismiss it as normal office noise. 

The other answers have some useful, actionable suggestions but I hesitate to up-vote them because they mostly seem to take the stance that you have been, or will be, less productive at home than in the office. From what you've written I don't believe there's any evidence to suggest this has happened yet. Given that you've had the wherewithal to post about your situation and ask for advice to remedy it, I'd imagine you wouldn't let that happen. A lot of how you can resolve this (if it can be resolved at all) depends on your company culture, particularly in relation to their work from home policy. My company (a software development shop) employs a "we don't care where you are as long as you are contactable and are getting your work done" policy. On the other hand my fianc√©e's company (also a software development shop) prefer its staff are in the office so she and I would have to resolve this in very different ways (if I had anything to resolve at all). My advice would be 

If your CV states that you have experience with these technologies then it's not an unreasonable request in my opinion. 

Good luck and hopefully it works out (and if it doesn't there are plenty of software developer jobs out there that allow remote working!). 

This depends greatly on the hiring processes of the company involved. In cases where your application is emailed to HR or hiring manager or internal recruiter, then CC'ing your contact would be the best decision. This allows him/her to see your complete application (resume/cover letter) and provide specific details to the hiring manager about your application. However, in many larger companies the process won't involve much email initially. When you apply, it is usually via an online form of some kind. When this happens, it usually won't be possible to CC'd your contact at all. In those cases, it is best to apply, and then directly email or call your contact and provide the details of your submission (such as an application number or job posting number or some other name/number to identify the specific opening and applicant). Your contact would then be able to contact HR and the hiring manager to provide his/her feedback to your application. I've done both methods in the past depending on the size of the company, and at my current (Fortune 100) company, I can confirm the 2nd suggestion is the only way to get an internal contact to provide a recommendations unless the specifically referred you to the position (which is a 3rd option if the company provides the option for employees to refer external candidates). 

I'm a recent college graduate from an IT program at a good state school in the United States. I have my B.S. in Information Technology with an emphasis in web development. The program was fairly coding-intensive. When I graduated from said University, I applied for a position as a WordPress developer and system administrator for a small marketing/web development company. They offered me 20$/hr for 20 hours a week during the first 3 months and then 22$/hr for full time after that. That corresponds to roughly 41k a year for the 20 hrs a week and roughly 46k a year for the period after that. The work is GREAT. I have very much enjoyed every single day I've worked since starting (front end web design and development was my ideal job since college), my co-workers are awesome, and I get to learn WP, sys admin, and coding skills one-on-one from a developer with 10+ years of experience. I'm a little hesitant because I feel like with an IT degree, I could have accepted a position elsewhere for a higher base rate. What do you think? Is the pay outlined pretty good for entry level web development for an employee straight out of college? Thanks for the help. 

I would argue that most companies would expect a contractor to have their own equipment. You are self-employed and part of the reason you are paid more as a contractor than an employee is that you have to cover costs that an employee wouldn't, ie: laptop, software licenses (for example if you use InteliJ you would pick up the cost of this). 

Speak with your team lead/project manager and explain the working arrangement you agreed (presumably with HR). If they weren't part of this decision they may feel aggrieved so be prepared for that. Explain why it's beneficial to you and agree that if your performance is affected by it then you will review the arrangement with them. Be open with your colleagues and explain the arrangement. It does sound like they're also making the assumption you will be slacking off/less productive when you work from home but we do only have your phrasing to go on! If that's really the case (do try re-assessing this after you've explained it to them) then the only way to ease their worries is to prove that you aren't going to be any less productive. Make sure you are contactable when you work from home. Whatever communication tool your company uses make sure you're signed in and super responsive. There's very few things that annoy office workers more than when someone is working from home and not responding. I'd keep your team informed of your status as well. If your baby starts crying and you need to take him/her for a walk, tell your team - that way when you don't respond they know why. And make sure you make up the time so you stay productive!
