A quick overview of the available literature supports the stated claims, if we assume that the popular image of the Inquisition involves routine torture and execution. In an article on "Inquisition Proceedings against Muslims in 16th Century Latin America" published in Islamic Studies, Rukhasana Qamber writes that: 

The answer is relatively clear once we abstract from religion and the age of the child. The question becomes, can one contract herpes from direct contact between mouth and genitals? The answer is a definite yes.1 The situation is only exacerbated by the age of the child and raw contact with an open wound. A meticulously-documented meta-analysis on religious practices in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases, examines MBP to find: 

This generally coincides with research on second-language acquisition (which is in some way similar to learning music). The pragmatic consensus is that theory and practice are both important in acquiring new skills.

The Department of Homeland Security responded in a statement released to the U.S. News and World Report. 

All calculations are therefore highly speculative, meaning they cannot be verified. For example, the calculations assume an average cost per procedure, where the costs are on a sliding scale and where we do not know the percentage of subsidized procedures, which would greatly affect revenue numbers. In addition, the claim is misleading in that it calculates the expenditures (cost per service rendered) as a fraction of annual revenue. The math is correct, but the explanation is not. The money does not "come from," it "goes to" these services.

In short: The press was relatively cautious in reporting on this story. Finally (by June, 2013), limited ("small scale") use of sarin by the Assad regime against the rebels was confirmed by the US intelligence community. A lot is riding on the answer to this question at the moment (Western support for Syrian rebels for example), and I suspect it will be difficult to extricate facts from politics going forward. Dan Roberts from the Guradian filed the following report on May 2, 2013: 

A detailed breakdown of the purchases can be found here. The report breaks down utility and purchases by department, which appear to be in line with previous years. The number of rounds purchased was 150mil in 2010, and around 100mil in 2011 and 2012. If anything, the number of purchased rounds is going down. The requested budget allows for 320 million rounds 2013, but that does not mean that the DHS will actually purchase the rounds. The agency has spent $36mil on ammo in 2012, and approximates spending $37mil in 2013, an estimated increase of 2.7% (not adjusted for inflation). I refer you to this article in the Military Times that discusses these numbers in greater detail. Note also that according to the National Shooting Sports Foundation, 10-12 billion rounds are produced domestically per year, with "many more billions" of foreign imports. Which would mean that the government is approved (and not guaranteed) to buy up to 2.6% of the national production per year, and a smaller number if we account for foreign imports. Mr. Nayak and Bert Medina, director of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement National Firearms and Tactical Training Unit put that number closer to 1%. Given that these estimates don't account for the existing inventory or unused manufacturing capacity, it seems the effects of the purchase are at best modest. Finally, note that the conspiracy theories about the government stockpiling ammo surface yearly around the budget time, and are propagated by conspiracy blogs that don't bother to read the released documentation. See for example the note on Skeptic Blog by Brian Donning from 2012. To conclude: (1) The documentary evidence speaks to the government's explicit intent of "procuring supplies" for the arms-bearing departments under the umbrella of the department of homeland security. These procurements are coordinated among multiple agencies, and at levels consistent with their purchases in the past few years. There is no mandate or evidence of collusion between these agencies to limit the market. (2) By conservative estimates, the government is approved to purchase between 1% and 2.6% of only the domestic supply of ammunition per year, constraining the potential impact on the market to these numbers. 

By this measure, a tree brings 50$ per year, and $2,500 over 50 years. The value in this study includes: "electricity (kWh/tree) and natural gas savings (kBtu/tree), atmospheric CO2 reductions (kg/tree), air quality improvement [NO2, PM10, and VOCs (kg/tree)], stormwater runoff reductions [precipitation interception (m3 /tree)], and property value increases [∆ LSA (m2 /tree)]. If I was wanting to be precise about the numbers, I would at least quote a range between these two estimates. 

The documents I cite above embody a small fraction of the available factual record on the matter. They represent the testimony of hundreds, the research and verification effort of thousands, and the experience of millions. While it is possible to contest some of the technical details in any one given document (the historical record is never perfect), the sheer number and variety of sources, their legitimacy in the eyes of the law, and their acceptance by the peer-reviewed academic community builds an overwhelming case for the Nazi regime's use of gas chambers in the mass extermination of Jews and other prisoner populations. Did the Holocaust really happen? Yes. The wholesale dismissal of established (if not always precise) historical facts in favor of speculation and innuendo is in effect a sign of conspiratorial thinking in general and Holocaust denial in particular. 

The Wikipedia article on the toothbrush mustache quotes the journalist and historian Ron Rosenbaum about the speculation that Hitler modeled his mustache on Charlie Chaplin: 

Now, I understand that plants consume some CO2, but to what extent do they "filter" the air from other toxins? What mechanical, chemical, or biological processes are involved? Do all plants have this effect or just some? Which toxins get filtered and which do not? How effective is plant-based air filtration in the home? 

For example, "A Demotic Inscribed Icosahedron from Dakhleh Oasis" by Martina Minas-Nerpel published in the The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology in 2007 (Vol. 93, pp. 137-148), describes "a unique icosahedron found at Qaret el-Muzzawaqa in the 1980s and now housed in the New Valley Museum at Kharga" (pictured above). Mina-Nerpel writes, 

David Bennett from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission has a great article on this topic in Tropical Rainforest Research, under the title of "Valuing a Tree: The Ethics of Environmental Evaluation." The gist of it is that converting trees to currency is not an exact science. A number of assumptions could go into such a calculation, producing a range of values. Bennett quotes the exact number from T.M. Das (in Singapore dollars by the way, which converted to US currency comes out to $158,739 / 50 years). About this metric he writes, 

Neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) is a somewhat controversial area of research, often relegated to journals like The Journal of Personal Selling and Sales Management.1 The NLP paradigm as a whole is generally discredited in the more mainstream scientific literature. A widely cited text on the topic concludes to say that: 

To answer the question in your title directly: yes, George Bernard Shaw publicly expressed sympathy for Hitler in the 1930s. This was less controversial before WWII than it was after. In a 1961 article on the topic, H.M. Geduld (then secretary of the Shaw Society) quotes from a lecture in 1933, where Shaw calls Hitler "a very remarkable, a very able man." Geduld writes:

Among many reputable sources, Witkowski cites an article in the Journal of Counseling Psychology, which concludes: 

There have been several experiments that measure the effectiveness of unsubscribing from spam, which concluded in favor of unsubscribing. For example, Kenneth Ladd Seldeen, a researcher with a Ph.D. in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, has set up the following: 

The sources I quote here suggest that even before the widespread introduction of Arabic numerals in Christian Europe, division was widely known, routinely performed on the abacus (and using hands), attested to in the literature of the period, and taught in the universities--all well before the 13th century. Additionally, for even more examples of the above consult the freely-available Rara Arithmetica.

None of the studies indexed by PubMed, a search engine of published articles maintained The United States National Library of Medicine at the National Institutes of Health, corroborate the original claim.1 Several studies, suggest the opposite effect, mostly related to the caffeine content of chocolate. These include the following findings: 

Complicating matters further is the question of definitions. In some sense, the very definition of the Holocaust relates to the fate of the European Jews. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, Holocaust means "the mass murder of the Jews by the Nazis in the war of 1939–1945." However, it can also be used as a transferred attribute, "of the similar fate of other groups," according to Oxford English. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum is therefore careful in discussing numbers related to "the victims of the Holocaust and Nazi persecution." The site lists the following figures:

A search of PubMed articles using keywords "booger," "muchoid," "nasal discharges," and even "rhinotillexis" yields absolutely zero results that could support the cited blog post. Reputable medical research does however caution against nose picking. In an article in the Journal of the National Medical Association by Albert Seltzer, who writes that: 

She goes on to cite examples of Egyptian icosahedra including: three "made of steatite or faience, inscribed with Greek letters" in Cairo and Paris museums, "four polyhedra from Egypt with Greek letters made of faience, serpentine, steatite, or calcite" housed in the British Museum, "a faience icosahedron inscribed with Greek letters" sold on the art market, and a rock crystal icosahedron "inscribed with Latin letters and Roman numerals" at the Louvre. These are described (or "published" in other words) in the literature and regarded as authentic by scholars and collectors. For more information you can begin with a chapter by W.J. Tait called "Dicing with the Gods" in Egyptian Religion, edited by W. Clarysse, A. Schoors, and H. Willems (Leuven: Peeters, 1998). It is worth mentioning that Platonic solids (of which icosahedron is one) were also known to the Greeks, at least as far back as 300 BC. Euclid attributes the discovery of the icosahedron to Theaetetus. (See "The Discovery of Regular Solids" by William C. Waterhouse in Archive for History of Exact Sciences, Vol. 9, No. 3, 30.XII.1972).

We can conclude the argument is not about the exact numbers, which are widely available (and amount to more than five million total), but about definitions. A greater care to address the specific categories of victims involved can resolve the ambiguity in the original quote. Consult the Holocaust Encyclopedia for more information. 

Perhaps the most fitting one-sentence answer to your question comes from an article by Ruth Behar, an anthropologist form University of Michigan, who begins an article on the subject by writing: 

On the subject of "The Repression of Sexual Behavior by the Aragonese Inquisition between 1560 and 1700" in the Journal of the History of Sexuality Andre Fernandez writes: 

According to a widely-cited study on the English lexicon, close to 60% of English words are of French or Latin origin. At the very least, a knowledge of Latin would increase your comprehension of the English language, particularly when it comes words that are longer than two syllables. The National Committee for Latin and Greek maintains that students who study Latin in high school do significantly better on their SAT scores, especially in the areas of reading and composition. (However, that could also be because Latin is not usually taught in your average public high school.) Finally, bilingualism of any sort has all kinds of beneficial cognitive effects.
