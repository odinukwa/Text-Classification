IMHO Zeppelins and blimps are too large and not good replacements for single family cars but could possibly be good replacements for railroads, intercity buses, airplanes, ocean liners, container ships, trucks, etc. under the right circumstances. Possibly hybrid vehicles combining zeppelin and airplane characteristics, or zeppelin and helicopter characteristics, or zeppelin and ground effect vehicle characteristics, may be the way to go. If fusion power becomes practical in small, lightweight generators, then plain air or common gases from the atmosphere could be heated up to become as light as hydrogen or helium, making hot air Zeppelins practical. 

There are many countries that are mostly democratic today, and which once were ruled by monarchs with strong powers, even though there has never been a monarch who was really "absolute" and all powerful. Some of of those mostly democratic countries still have monarchs today who have little or no political power. Study the history of those countries to find the changes between largely nondemocratic rule by the monarch and largely democratic rule by representatives elected by (most or all) of the people. In some of those countries the process may have been gradual. In countries where the process was gradual, you might find periods where the monarchs had enough power to satisfy your "real power" requirement and the government is democratic enough to satisfy our "democracy" requirement. $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ 

Suppose that pills are coated with emetics so that someone who takes an overdose will vomit them up and maybe survive. Suppose that someone injects deadly poison or maybe an overdose of the medicine into the pills of their intended victim. If the target takes the normal amount of pills, the poison or extra medicine will kill him. But if he accidentially takes an overdose, the high level of emetics will cause him to vomit and perhaps vomit enough to survive. So this has taking more of the specially sabotaged pills having less of a probability of death. But it does work only by having the pills contain two or three different drugs with different effects, not one single drug. 

Two theories: 1) I envision a planet that spins significantly more rapidly than Earth and for this reasons and possibly other reasons has a more oblate shape. It has a ring of connected continents around the equator and has northern and southern oceans with other continents and islands in them. The equatorial continents have very tall mountain ranges and plateaus and have an average altitude a mile or so higher than the land around the poles and the surface of the polar seas. Thus the equatorial continents have fewer green house gases above them than the areas around the poles. The higher parts of the equatorial continents are covered with glaciers that reflect sunlight back into space. The poles are above thinner sections of crust and more internal heat seeps through in the polar regions than in the equatorial regions with much thicker crust due to the oblate shape of the planet, and the continents on top of that. The spin axis of the planet is almost in the plane that it revolves around its sun in. Thus during northern hemisphere summer the northern polar regions are in direct almost vertical sunlight all during the summer and heat up greatly, while the southern polar regions are in shade and nighttime all through their winter and are cooling off. In the northern winter it is the opposite, the northern polar regions are in darkness all winter and cool off while the southern polar regions are in summer and constant nearly vertical sunlight and heat up. During those seasons the equatorial regions receive sunlight at very low angles and do not heat up much, and every hill and mountain casts a very long and cold shadow. In the spring and fall seasons the equator receives direct vertical sunlight, but it is almost all reflected back into space and doesn't heat up the surface much. And since the planet rotates there will be fast days and nights all over the planet during those seasons so heat will not build up in any region. The polar regions will receive sunlight during the day during the spring and fall seasons but it will be at very low angles and not heat up the surface much. Thus the equatorial regions, because they are cold and icy all year, will not be able to heat up and so will remain cold and icy all year. The polar regions will have normal seasons being hotter in the summer and colder in the winter. But they may be warmer during their winter than the equatorial regions are all year. 2) Another theory is an Earth-sized moon A orbits a gas giant planet B that orbits a star C. Moon A's rotation has been slowed down until it always keeps the same face toward planet B, it's rotational period and orbital period have the same length. The orbit of moon A around planet B could take about a single Earth day. The Galilean moons of Jupiter orbit at distances and periods of 421,700 kilometers and 1.769 days (Io), 676,938 kilometers and 3.551 days (Europa), 1,070,400 kilometers and 7.154 days (Ganymede), and 1,882,700 kilometers and 16.689 days (Callisto). You would want the moon to orbit faster to have a strong enough magnetic field to protect it from solar wind. And as the moon A obits planet B it will gradually recede farther and farther away from planet B, as Earth's moon gradually recedes from the Earth. Until eventually Moon A's orbital period around Planet B will equal in length planet B's orbital period around star C. So moon A will rotate at such a speed that it will always keep the same side facing toward planet B and away from star C and the other side facing away from planet B and toward star C. The sub stellar point on moon A will always get direct vertical light from Star C and will get hotter and hotter. Hot water in the oceans and hot air in the atmosphere will flow away from the sub stellar point to the opposite side of the planet that gets no light from star C. Since they get no starlight there, they would normally freeze. But the point opposite to the sub stellar point on moon A will be pointing toward planet B, a huge gas giant planet that might have a high albedo and might reflect a lot of light from star C back to the side of Moon C and heat it up. Thus moon A might have a hot area that gets constant direct light from star C, an opposite warm area that gets light from star C reflected off of planet B, and a cold area on the edge between the two hemispheres. Could a gas giant planet and its hypothetical Earth sized moon orbit a star close enough to get as much light and heat from the star as Earth Gets from the Sun? Yes. Such a planet is called a hot Jupiter and it is one of the most commonly detected types of extra solar planets. The hot Jupiter with the shortest year, WASP-19B, has a mass of 1.15 Jupiter masses and orbits WASP-19 at a distance of about 0.1655 astronomical units and a year of about 0.788 Earth days. Could a planet orbit within the habitable zone of a star and have such a short year? TRAPPIST-1g has an orbital radius of 0.0451 astronomical units and a year of 12.352 Earth days, and orbits within the habitable zone of TRAPPIST-1. TRAPPIST-1f has an orbital radius of 0.037 astronomical units and a year of 9.2066 Earth days, and orbits within the habitable zone of TRAPPIST-1. TRAPPIST-1e has an orbital radius of 0.028 astronomical units and a year of 6.099 Earth days, and orbits within the habitable zone of TRAPPIST-1. Thus it is certainly possible to calculate the parameters of a star system where a tidally locked habitable Earth-sized moon A orbits a gas giant planet B that orbits a star C, and where the orbital period of moon A around planet B and the orbital period of planet B around star C are identical for a short era by astronomical standards. Thus one side of moon A could always face star C and the other side could always face planet B. On Earth and planets that have Earthlike orbital characteristics the ring around the equator is the hot tropical zone and the temperate zones are rings north and south of the tropics, and the cold polar zones are circles surrounded by the rings of the temperate zone. On moon A, the circle around the sub stellar point would be the hot tropical zone, surrounded by a ring shaped temperate zone, and the cold zone would be a ring around the twilight zone on the edge between eternal day and eternal night. Except that light from star C reflected from planet B might make the opposite side have a similar climate pattern, though probably not as warm. This orbital arrangement gives habitable moon A the desired arrangement of tropical, temperate, and polar zones, except that they do not center around moon A's poles of rotation. Of course one could always claim that the sub stellar point and the sub planetary point are the "temperature poles" of moon A, or maybe call them the east and west poles. 

Someone could arrange for that to happen in a way that would be sort of a cheating method. 1) It is certainly possible for someone's grandchild to have by chance the exact same genetic code; but the odds against that ever happening are astronomical. 2) Therefor some medical way to ensure that someone has a grandchild with their exact genetic code would be needed. Someone could clone themselves and have their daughter serve as a surrogate mother for the clone. Thus when the clone was born it would be the (nongenetic) child of their daughter and thus their grandchild. That seems like using a loose and somewhat cheating definition of grandchild but it is something that it might be possible for medical science to achieve only decades in the future. 

IMHO opinion Merlin should build a building around the sword in the stone. The building should have a floor, and the sword in the stone (on top of an anvil if I remember correctly) should be on top of a pedestal that keeps it away from moisture on the floor. Possibly the building should be designed with many concentric shells and many floors and roofs, with the sword in the stone in the center most room. And perhaps to make it more impressive the building should have domes within domes within domes with the sword in the stone beneath the innermost dome. No doubt Merlin will have to build robots to repair the building and keep the dehumidifiers running and repair each other and keep thieves out. I note that many artifacts including swords have been found in water in northern Europe, apparently ritually deposited by Celtic peoples. So apparently iron swords do not rust away into nothing during 1,500 to 2,000 years in the water. Many bronze items including swords have also been found in dirt or water having survived rather intact for 3,000 years. Thus it might be wise for Merlin to make or obtain a bronze sword for the stone. Iron did not replace bronze because it was better as much as because it was cheaper and more common. So a bronze sword could be as good as an iron sword and maybe more resistant to corrosion. And maybe gilding the sword before putting it in the stone would help it stay as good as new for decades, centuries, or millennia. 

One thing that having a second smaller sun in the sky does is make the days seem longer. As the two stars orbit their center of gravity in a period of several hours, days, or weeks, sometimes the smaller sun will eclipse the larger one, sometimes the larger sun will eclipse the smaller one, and the majority of the time they will be seen side by side in the sky. And sometimes as the planet turns only one star will be visible in the sky. James specified that the stars orbit each other at a distance of 0.5 AU. If the planet is at a distance of 1 AU, the stars can look as much as 30 degrees of arc apart in the sky of the planet. So when the two stars are at their maximum separation, The brighter one will be visible without the dimmer one for about 0.08333 of a planetary rotation period, the dimmer one will be visible without the brighter one for about 0.08333 of a planetary rotation period, and both should be visible together in the sky for about 0.416667 of a planetary rotation period, if my calculations are correct. Thus when the two suns are farthest apart, the day should last for about 0.58333 of a planetary rotation period and the night last for about 0.41667 of a planetary rotation period. If the planet has no axial tilt, of course. When the two stars are closer together the periods of only a single sun being visible will be less and less of the total rotation period. It is possible that the animals and humanoids on James's planet may have adaptations to see better during the light of only one of the two suns. If James wants to make his system scientifically probable, he should significantly reduce the distance between the two suns. Astronomers have calculated the stability of possible planets in binary systems, including S type orbits, where the planet orbits only one of the stars, and P type or circumbinary orbits where the planet orbits both of the stars.

What difference does it make how much light is reflected from snow, ice, or water? Are the solar panels going to be facing the snow, ice, or water, or are they going to be facing the Sun? And if the solar panels are facing the Sun, of course occasional storms may coat them with snow or ice. But once the snow or ice gets too thick, it will be opaque anyway and let zero light get through to the solar panels. Since the Sun is usually at a low angle in the arctic regions the solar panels would be almost vertical, and thus rainwater would run off them and they would quickly dry from rain. So snow and ice would be the problem. And the answer to that would be to turn the solar panels parallel to the wind when it is raining, snowing, sleeting, or hailing, so that as little precipitation as possible is blown onto the solar panels. And then heat up the solar panels so the ice and snow closest to them melts, and slides off the almost vertical solar panels, which will disconnect the remaining ice and snow from the panels, and thus the remaining ice and snow will also slide off. And waste heat rising from a multi story single building city could warm up solar panels on top of the city. 

All it takes is a big enough cosmic collision and the the planet will be unrecognizable. For example, the oceans could be almost entirely boiled away into outer space. Thus the outlines of continents and oceans will not be immediately recognizable from other space. But if Bobby is able to make a radar scan and a record of the heights of the surface, he may later recognize the outlines of the former continental shelves. I fear that boiling away the oceans is already getting into extinction of all life on the planet territory. So an even bigger catastrophe that alters the outlines of the continental shelves would probably exterminate all life. So you should assume that Bobby is really, really, really bad at geography. And also that your planet doesn't have large continents, just hundreds and thousands of really large islands with a total land area similar to that of Earth. Thus making it almost impossible for people with better geographic skills than Bobby to remember the shapes of the islands and their shelves. Or maybe the opposite. The planet had large low lying continents and vast ice caps when Bobby left. Something melted all the ice caps and the sea level rose many thousands of feet and now the continents are all under shallow seas except for many small islands in their higher regions. Bobby doesn't have enough geographic sense to recognize that the islands are shaped like the highlands of his planet. That avoids a catastrophe that boils away most of the oceans.
