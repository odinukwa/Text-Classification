Truing wheels around here costs about 20 dollars. I have a cheap rear wheel that has 32 spokes. This is a rear wheel that came with a Bikes Direct bike, to give you an idea of its quality. The hubs are unbranded and the rims are Alex DA14s. The wheel is severely out of true and I've resorted to taking off the rear brake pads. The front wheel is better off but not by much. I could buy a new Shimano wheelset for about 100 dollars. From what I read online these wheels come true and stay relatively true for a few thousand miles easily. My experience with lower-end, big-brand wheels has been wholly positive too - they've all stayed very true and none of them have required re-truing. I could also spend about 90 dollars and get the Performance Titan wheelset. The thing about these is that they crack after a few thousand miles apparently. But I don't mind since Performance has a lifetime satisfaction warranty, so even if they fail, I can just exchange them for a new one, free of charge. Would it be worth buying the new wheelset and running them down into the ground or truing up my cheap wheels? To me, truing my cheap wheelset once gets me halfway there to a new wheelset that likely won't require any truing during its lifetime. What do you think? 

I was plucking at the spokes of my rear wheel today which has an asymmetric lacing pattern. It's 2 spokes (both tangential to the rim) on the drive side along with a single spoke on the non-drive side. There are 7 of these triplets spread across the rim. So in one pair of DS spokes, one spoke had a dramatically different pitch than the other spoke in the pair. This spoke also felt a tiny bit looser when pushed on. Spinning the wheel and using the brake blocks as a reference, the rear wheel is slightly out of true. There is some lateral bias - but the runoff looks pretty tiny. Definitely not an issue even when running brake pads very close to the rim. This to me suggests that this should not be an issue. Blame me for being paranoid regarding an expensive wheelset that's almost brand new. In any case, what are the chances of having this loose spoke pop in the future? Should I bring the wheel into a shop and ask for a truing? Do all shops check for even spoke tension at the end of a truing? I've heard of people who got their wheels trued only to end up with a cracked rim shortly afterward or popped spokes - presumably because the mechanic didn't bother to check spoke tension. 

Some good suggestions here, including tires and either toeclips/straps or clipless pedals. One question that hasn't been touched on : are you in the right gear? If you are either pedalling fast against no resistance, or pushing hard but turning the pedals slowly, you are in the wrong gear, and learning the right gear for you (or the right gear for each uphill or downhill section) will help your average speed. Perhaps experiment with a slightly higher gear than you normally use one day, and a lower gear the next, and see how your time - and comfort - compares. If you always find yourself in the top (or bottom) gear, or one gear is too low but the next is too high, then (with a bike shop's help) you can improve the gearing on your bike for a fraction of its cost, by replacing the block or one of the chainrings. Another : Are the saddle and handlebars at the right height? If your knee is still bent at the bottom of your pedal stroke, try raising the saddle half an inch at a time - when you get to the right position, 1/4 inch either way makes a big difference. Saddle fore/aft position and handlebar position also make a difference, but less spectacularly so. 

Ride comfort and efficiency on rough surfaces both play a part. A larger wheel helps both of these - smoothing out bumps for comfort, and reducing vertical motion (wasted energy). Small wheel bicycles such as folding bikes are tolerable on smooth surfaces, but aren't famed for off-road ability, comfort or speed. The extreme in large wheels was the Ordinary bicycle, (aka penny farthing) which provided appropriate "gearing" with a direct drive wheel - but it also provided comfort and efficiency (not so much safety!) on the unmade roads of the era. When gearing became practical and accepted, wheel sizes diminished for convenience and safety - indeed, geared bicycles were known as "Safety" as opposed to "Ordinary" bicycles - but only so far, thanks to the need for comfort and efficiency on rough roads. 

I have a wheelset with a Campagnolo cassette body. I want to run Sora 9-speed brifters with my wheelset. Will this work? I believe that it will because according to the information posted on Sheldon's site ($URL$ and that a Campagnolo cassette with Shimano spacers is within 0.03mm of a Shimano cassette's spacing all the time, and this matches the tolerances of a SRAM cassette - which is known to work with Shimano components. A Campy cog is 1.75mm thick. A Shimano cassette is 1.78mm thick. A SRAM cassette is 1.8mm thick. However, SRAM spacers are 2.54mm thick. Shimano spacers are 2.56mm thick. So it appears that SRAM makes up for its extra cog thickness by reducing spacer thickness. There is a 0.05mm difference between a SRAM cog and a Shimano cog, but the spacer is thinner on SRAM setups - by 0.02mm, so the net difference between Shimano and SRAM in terms of cog center to cog center is only 0.03mm. A Campagnolo cassette with Shimano spacers will similarly have a 0.03mm tolerance as Campagnolo sprockets are 0.03mm thinner than Shimano cassettes. So, will it work? Any real life experiences? 

I notice that my fork is squeezed together when I tighten the quick release mechanism. Is it possible then to over torque the quick release and squeeze the fork too close together? 

What could be causing this? Tires are about 200 miles old. Used almost exclusively on smooth, cleaned asphalt. Sometimes gravel. Also - is the tire still safe? 

I ran a squeaky chain for a while on my bike and subsequently destroyed the chain and the cassette. Both were swapped out at the exact same time for a new chain and cassette. Now I am afraid that the chainrings have been damaged. I suspect that the chainrings have been damaged because it's only been about two months with my new chain and I am not a frequent rider. I ride in almost pristine conditions - I ride on regularly maintained roads and have NEVER gotten a puncture on the road I put in most of my miles on. I only put about 500 miles (if that) on this chain. The path is dry and the only objection that one might be able to raise is that it's slightly dusty at some points. The only maintenance I've done is a few squirts of White Lightning Semi-Dry Lube after breaking in the chain. It came to me pretty greased up so I left it as is until I rode it for a fair bit before giving it a quick shot of lube. So I'm pretty surprised that my chain looks to be pretty worn judging from a quick ruler measurement. In the attached pictures I have lined up the 0 marking on my ruler with the end of a roller and from what I've read online, if a chain is new, the 12" marking of the ruler should be covering up most if not all of a roller. On my chain the 12" marking is barely covering up a roller. I've taken the chain off the bike, yes, but I've stretched it when laying it across the ground. Even on my bike where the chain has been tensioned, the 12" end of the ruler still fails to cover up the roller. I also did an informal test in which I shifted the bike into the big chainring and pulled on the chain to see how many teeth I could expose. I saw at least 3-4 partially exposed teeth with this method. I read that if you can see more than half an exposed tooth, then your chain is stretched. So: 

Saddle burn could be clothing - those soft lined lycra pants are sold for a reason - or it could be an unsuitable saddle - a friendly bike shop should let you explore alternatives. A good quality leather saddle (like the legendary Brooks B17) wears in to fit you over several thousand miles, so if that's what you're using, don't give up on it yet. And finally, you do have to get used to the saddle too. When I went touring, long distances after everyday riding, the start of the second and third days was agony, things got better by the fourth... Others have covered gearing and simply getting used to the exercise well, but there hasn't been enough mention of saddle height. If you haven't had the bicycle fitted to you properly, the saddle may be several inches too low! Try walking around the house with your thighs almost horizontal ... or Cossack dancing ... it's damn hard work! You'll respect those Cossack soldiers after that! It's the same riding a bicycle with the saddle too low. As a rough guide, if you're sitting on the saddle, with your heel on a pedal at the bottom of its stroke (in line with the seatpost) your leg should be straight. That's too high to reach the ground when you're still in the saddle. The trick is to use the forward pedal as a step when starting - your full weight on it gets you moving nicely too. But it's a much more efficient riding position. Then experiment with quarter inch changes around that position to find what works best for you. Fore and aft position matter too, ditto handlebar position, but build them all around the correct seat height. That's where the power is - between the seat and the pedals. 

Motorbikes don't have the same need for efficiency, as they have a bit more than 1/4 horsepower to play with, so they can use more sophisticated suspension, and much softer and fatter tyres, to win out on the comfort front even with smaller wheels. The fatter tyres are also important for better roadholding at speeds that cyclists don't normally experience. So both forms of transport seem to have settled on the size of wheel that best meets their conditions. 

I can think of six possibilities (however realistic each may or may not be, and not in any particular order) for crank advancement through an angle out of proportion to the driven wheel in a fixed gear setup... (1) 24TPI hub threading not fully bottomed by the cog as it should be. The reverse-thread lockring, if all parts are truly tight, should prevent this altogether, but tightening the lockring would not necessarily ensure the cog is bottomed against the hub shoulder (since the cog won't cooperate by going ahead and tightening [like axle cones often do] if the lockring is tighened against it while loose). I have not experienced this, but since the lockring has a left-hand thread, I assume it could be loose from the cog without immediate catastrophe. The cog would then be allowed to rotate on its screw threads through a small range, but it could not completely unscrew because of the reversed thread conflict. The scenario provides that the cog is intermittently screwing back and forth between 2 shoulders (and both ends of this range might feel like freewheel threads being tightened [with alternating direction] when torque application is reversed). Hypothetically speaking, a same-threaded locknut would not do this, but rather be free to unscrew by the impetus of the next nut over (which would be the cog), and the results WOULD be catastrophic. This seems pretty possible to me. If I install a freewheel by hand, even using a chain whip, I can still feel it tightening when I start riding and get my weight and leg muscles into it in the normal drivetrain usage. This suggests that if a fixed cog were applied using only hand strength, and then a lockring were immediately applied, perhaps that final tightening takes place after the lockring is set, and since post-tightening of the cog causes the "nuts" (cog and lockring) to be DIVERGENT, there would be room for what I described since it would be free (enough for leg power at least) to untighten from the hub and tighen against the lockring under back-torque. Assuming you have brakes, my suggestion is to use leg force to tighten the fixed cog and stop with the brakes (or whatever it takes to avoid any backpedaling) and then re-tighten the lockring and ride as normal to see if the problem goes away. Without brakes, find a way (like do it uphill, or use impact if you can fashion some kind of boss or linkage to the cog) to maximize tightening torque before the lockring is finally snugged. Make sure the threads, as well as the faces of the cog and lockring, are clean and there are no spacers or anything but hard surfaces for bearing the torque. (2) I have not heard of this happening other than in my imagination, but it seems pretty conceivable that perhaps the soft male threads on the hub have worn [stripped] sufficiently to allow the driven cog to skip over them under sufficient torque. This would be more likely if the bike had previously been ridden with the rear cog and lockring inadequately tightened. This would effectively require hub replacement in any hub I have seen (where the male threads are a permanent and fundamental part of the hub body. Even just short of tight, there is often noticeable play in these threads, which is why I imagined this possibility. (3) Chain skip, which I think was hinted above would require a pretty extreme pitch mismatch in a single speed train in order to ride on the tooth peaks without trough engagement. It's a remote possibility, and you would probably hear an ugly metallic racket as this took place. Moreover if your chainline is imperfect, this could easily result in a thrown chain. edit: If this is possible it would imply that the chain is already WAY too loose. (4) Tire slippage is possible (however unusual in an inflated tire), and might feel a little like thread friction (also being a quiet phenomenon). I have seen tires [that don't have much "gum" over the carcass material in the bead area] with low inflation be able to slip on the rim under torsion. Not much of this would be possible before damaging the valve stem if the tube goes along for the ride, but if it stays with the rim (less likely), the tire could slip infinitely. Most tires stick pretty well but I have seen exceptions. This is the reason for rim-locks in fat low-pressure tires. A test of increasing inflation should eliminate this possibility. (5) I have definitely experienced a type of crank wear that could feel like this (but only for your left foot). In conventional square-splines, if you do a lot of standing, jumping, etc., with your right foot forward, the torque in the spindle is reversed from normal pedaling action by any downward force that ends up evenly distributed between both pedals (as in, coasting NOT pedaling). (Keeping your left foot forward as a general rule when standing negates this possibility) The soft square-taper-broached holes in the crank arms can develop play on the spindle and then the left crank is allowed to swing through a dead angle (relative to the right crank's constant chain engagement) that may feel similar. In very minor cases, the spindle cap screws or nuts can be tightened down harder to "cold-form" the crank arms (they're pretty much toast by this point anyway but you can get home on them by doing this). In more advanced cases, I have used a piece of an aluminum beverage can to shim the tapered hole and hard torque to remedy. Ultimately the condition necessitates crank replacement. *edit: I think this problem is more likely with the older "nut-on-stud" crank attachment to the spindle since the serrated side of the nut reacts to any crank movement and provides a quick foothold for development of slop. I changed my habits away from having my right foot forward while standing at about the same time as I started using a cap-screwed (rather than nutted) bottom bracket, and I have not had this problem since, so I'm not sure how likely it is in other cases. (6) Backlash from chain being too loose. The chain should always be loose enough to not be taut at the tightest point (found by rotating the system until the minimum chain play is found - play adjustment should be made at this rotational position only). If there is eccentric wear or manufacturing fault in either sprocket, this could be more extreme but there still always has to be at least slight play. If the variance is extreme, then at the loosest rotational phase of the system, there would be considerable backlash, the 'dead angle' which the cranks must subtend between application of forward and rearward torque (regardless of rotation position or speed - it's the transition from the slack being at the bottom run of the chain with forward drive to it being at the top run of chain with rearward drive, regardless of actual movement). This would not feel "frictional" like the hub thread tightening phenomenon, but more like a free angle between abrupt endpoints, like when you switch from coasting to pedaling on very coarsely pawled freewheels or freehubs.
