Context First, let me frame my question by establishing a shared understanding of what I mean by "view." Throughout all forms of Buddhism as far as I know, the Four Noble Truths are considered essential Buddhadharma. Included in the 4th Truth is the Eightfold Path, which Bhikkhu Bodhi (in Noble Eightfold Path) describes as follows: 

I don't think I would claim that 24-minute increments are 'ideal', but they've worked in my experience. Perhaps this is simply because I feel tremendous confidence and respect toward Alan Wallace, and am used to working with 24-minute increments in following his instructions. I encourage you to experiment (perhaps taking the gathika as a working hypothesis) and find out what works for your mindstream in light of your aspirations and the specific forms of meditation you wish to pursue. There are many variables to explore! Finally, here's some interesting food for thought, which I think highlights how the appropriate length of a meditation period corresponds to the condition of one's mind, and requires introspective assessment of one's own meditative experience. Padmasambhava has been quoted as saying: 

If serious with the practice, if having real faith in the Buddha, or even insight, YES: never ever lie and become more innovative in complicated seeming cases. There is no reason to ly. If starting reasoning all precepts have no use at all, but actually to simply cut of the danger of reasoning (opposition of the defilements) is the Sīlas purpose. In regard of this merely polemic question, Breath had posted, here some general and specific answers to help those still having the need of reasoning in regard of strict precepts for a strict aim: release. 

A monk would not enter certain places with dirty feets. People who might get arware of such situation, and take such as a change of skilful deeds in generosity, service and also paying respect. Very Fruitful deeds, if having directed the mind to tge Sangha or meet even a worthy person. As for the relation teacher and studend, such is a service good to be done. It also happens, that if people see you walking, might give a monks feets refreshing and cleaning. All of those meritiouse deeds fall eighter under generosity (giving water, time and towel), paying respect or doing a service (later two are already part of the virtue section of the path, and require right view as prerequisite). In regard of Seniour Monk: even if washing the feets of a lay person, worthy of gifts, worthy of respect (for everyone his father and mother), not to soeak about a young novice, having mind right set, or meeting even a already Noble Person, is of real high benefit. 

To give an example of the role of View from an Indo-Tibetan tradition, Sachen Kunga Nyingpo had a vision in which Manjushri taught: "If there is grasping, you do not have the View.” This same teaching includes 3 specific attachments to relinquish leading up to this: 

I am in no position to speak for the Dalai Lama, though personally confident that he will never abandon Bodhichitta. But I think I can partly answer your question even so. Choosing not to be reborn as the Dalai Lama of Tibet says nothing about whether he might choose to reincarnate in some other form and position that is of greater benefit to beings, and in particular better serves the further development of Tibetan politics and culture. In other words, it certainly doesn't follow from HHDL's statement that he has foregone reincarnation altogether. 

By touch (phassa) of the certain sense-base, certain recognition (viññāṇa) is caused or vici versa. If there is ground, meaning that mind takes it a object (ārammaṇa), as a whole or in detail, it leads to feeling (vedanā). If there is no ground, surface, having release as Object, such as suffering does not appear. The meeting of ground here, the touch of ignorance (avijjāsamphasso, SN 22.81), should be understood. A good, even it merely motivated to discuss about a certain teacher, Dhamma lesson can be found here: Phassa People love philosophy since it does not require to let go of thought of "me, myself and I". 

The lesser knowing and understandig the teachings of the Buddha and the more people are into "Buddhist" and "Buddhism" they lesser they accept homeless ascetics, even if having taken refuge into the three gems. The therm Anagarika seems to be a special Sinhalese rendering and is merely unknow in other Buddist countries. A person still taking money, using money, can not really be called a homeless, recluse or Samana. For the Sangha, other recluses should be no problem, and either they speak Dhamma or not, would lead them in regard of respect. There are serial rules dealing how Bikkhus have to handle with not ordained beggars. One thing one should be aware, one does neither have a/the community of monks as support or refuge nor sociaty, so one needs a lot of confiction and resolution to walk such a way. One should be also aware, that if thinking in ways "I don't like to work, I have no support, what if I wear the Robs of the Bhikkhus and mingle my self under the Bhikkhus, since they are well supported". In such case, out of such an intention, Bhikkhus would not be allowed to ordain someone having cheated being a full ordained Bhikkhu before while not. Very practical it's of course good to have a community somehow behind, on the other hand such also has its limits of benefit an disadvantages. Its not easy today and was also not easy in times of the Buddha, incl. the Buddha him self, living as real homelessness without a communal support and big reputation and adverticing behind. So it's really not a "let's see what comes along" life for certain periode of time. How ever, there are less wise and knowledgeable people, whether members of the Sangha nor housholder, becoming aware of an recluse, who do not highly respect really homeless beggars on a/the path for liberation. 

It is not clear if you are doing some formal practice; if you do it regularly, you are likely to see the conditions more clear and learn to deal with them. The best is to do a retreat. In the usual forms of vipassana (Mahasi & similar I am familar with), you have an anchor (breathing, walking) and when something else comes to your mind (through the 6 sense doors -- western 5 senses plus mind, which includes thoughts, feelings, states of mind etc), you acknowledge/label/note/name what happened and come back to the anchor. This way you learn to (a) see what is there (b) let it go and come back to the anchor. Both points (a) and (b) are important; that's how you learn to deal with whatever happens. In fact, various states of mind such as frozen, switched-off or dissociated are common. If you find yourself in a stuck state, you can use the "stuck" label to acknowledge that state, and come back. If you find yourself you want to get rid of that state (as you say), acknowledge that wanting and come back. The feeling of being watched is also a feeling you should acknowledge. When you follow a condition (which the mind does automatically when you don't acknowledge it), you see that a whole drama unfolds: first you notice the stuckness, then you dislike it, then you want to get rid of it, then you perhaps remember that it happened many times and you get frustrated or desperate, then you think what you've done wrong so that it does not disappear, maybe you think there is something wrong with you in general etc etc. That is endless. Acknowledge it as soon as you can, as quickly as you can, and let it go. See what comes next. That's the practice, always coming back to the present. 

Once two old people approached the Buddha, Upasaka Saptha Visuddhi, and told that they missed to made merits, now fearing death. The Buddha, honest forward, for the sake of benefit for many listening to it, Simply said, that they fear righteously and then utterd: 

Alan, while it is right that on the path, practicing (Dhamma) is the real refuge to reach the targed of refuge, awakening, which means Buddho, one need those who guide one (Sangha) to be able to make one self an island with the Dhamma (practicing). That means one needs to cut of the greates obstacel fist, and that is wanting to become a "Buddhist". To work against ones usuall desires one works in a way to train one self in what is called practice in veneration or paying respect. This practice goes against the raw defilement. Once a person has gained the throwing away of all what is normaly taken as real (five aggregates) having sacrified them for his refuge, one comes to see the Dhamma, the Buddha as well as the Sangha as it really is. From this time on, one by one self becomes member of the Sangha (in perfect context) and so also knows all the values of the three juweles as they really are. It is foolish and sadly a western or better modern approch to motivate people to see more value in the own person and in becoming "a real Buddhist" so that most never ever start even to work against raw defilement. Thats the maketing of industry to be able to sell a product for many. Usually the training of Veneration as one of the ten meritious deeds, starts with bodily and verbal actions and step by step one also learns how to sacrify the mental factors in the same way. Just such a practice, even if not full comprehended, will be the foundation to be once able to maintain proper attention while hearing the true Dhamma, so able to gain right view and the doing the conductive rites and rites naturally. So one is good introduced to do not wslk the "cool" way, jet still very hot and cut the fundamental practice off right at the beginning. One having become different already would never have a problem with veneration of the gems nor would he/she ever tell somebody that it does not make sense to practice Sila, since veneration of what is worthy to counts as virtue right on the path and staightens one views. A huge topic, leading direct to awakening. Just be taking really refuge in the Gems one becomes a person no more able to fall off the path. Hier a useful short essay: 

As one's understanding of emptiness and dependent origination deepens, the reasoning that "things appear because they are empty, and are empty because they appear" actually becomes quite compelling and seems quite simple (though profound) when compared to more elaborate analyses such as the "vajra splinters" reasoning (referenced here). 

Karma doesn't have or reflect an agenda, so it's not agreeing with or encouraging behavior any more than the law of gravity is "punishing" someone who steps off a cliff by smashing them into the ground. But it still hurts or kills us if we step off a cliff - even if we do so mistakenly thinking we can fly. Gravity won't stop and go: "hmm, this is a perfectly nice person who is just confused and not suicidal, I think I'll let him/her down gently this time." A major difference between karma and rules like the law of gravity is that karma is cause-and-effect of the mind, not just the body. Because we have minds, we can be happy and we can suffer. Each of us wants to be happy, so karma is called "good" when it brings about happiness. None of us want to suffer, and we call karma "bad" when it brings suffering. However, we're just sentient beings so we are very confused about things most of the time, including about what intentions and actions will really bring happiness and end suffering. (All too often, we're the well-intentioned fool stepping off a cliff and meaning to fly.) The ethical teachings we study and practice in Buddhism are trying to guide us out of this confusion, as we train in more skillful kinds of behavior and thought. Most importantly, they call for long-term thinking: yes, being rich (if it makes you happy) is the fruit of good karma; but what use is it to build up good karma and then burn up the ensuing good fortune in mundane pursuits? On the other hand, if we adopt a vast motivation (such as bodhichitta) and aim toward awakening as a Buddha for the sake of ourselves and all sentient beings, all the acts of body and mind directed toward this end will eventually lead to stainless, perfect happiness of a different nature, one entirely beyond the stimulus-driven ups and downs of karma. 

"It appears that Buddhism depends on a central premise -- that all worldly existence = suffering / dukkha." This is a correct result of an investigation. "Are there Buddhist teachers or traditions that teach a joyous approach to worldly life?" There are many if not most "Buddhist Teacher" and Traditions calling themselves after the Noble Ones. How ever, neither the Buddha, nor his good following desciples, not teacher of the Buddhas Dhamma do such. Why? Becaus they tell what is true and conductive for the path. Every time that one does not see the danger, does not put effort into the training, is wasted time. You can enjoy the reat when work is done. "Are there any teachings that profess existence is a joyous, if sometimes painful experience, or at least a tolerably pleasant experience? An eternal roller-coaster ride of birth-and-death, joy and sorrow, that one need not seek to escape?" There are, but not founded in Buddhas Dhamma. Mara constanty teaches such and so those overwhelmed of him as well. Who ever does not see him/herself the first noble truth, or reject faith, firm faith in it, is incapable to make any long therm conductive and wholesome use of Buddhas teachings, is still a wordling and regarded as outsider. In regard of the main Question: "Is it necessary for a Buddhist to believe that existence is suffering?" A self called "Buddhist" may believe what ever he wants, and yes, there have always been follower not really knowing the deeper sense of Buddhas teaching and he did not much worry about it. 

Sorry, but I am not familiar with the "31 planes of existence" so hopefully someone else can speak to that specifically. But the bottom line to me is that if Buddha knows all beings, he knows their various abodes as well however they are categorized. 

Right view has a very important role in that unfolding. One's very definition of "Noble" or "wisdom" reflects one's view, and in fact it seems that inquiry into and transformation of view is integral to how and where one travels as a sentient being. As Bhikkhu Bodhi writes in the same book: 

Cultivating bodhicitta (both ultimate and relative) is absolutely indispensable on the Mahayana path; and one who has vowed to do so is called a bodhisattva. From my understanding, this vow can be made with as little or as much pomp and circumstance as befits one's mind - the key is to inspire confidence and commitment. Check out Shantideva's 'Way of the Bodhisattva' for a truly awesome and beautiful way to undertake this path. Also see Patrul Rinpoche's 'Words of My Perfect Teacher' and his discussion of the vow of bodicitta starting at p. 220. He says: "True absolute bodhicitta is attained by the power of meditation and does not depend on rituals. To generate relative bodhicitta, however, as beginners we need some procedure to follow, a ritual through which we can take the vow in the presence of a spiritual teacher. We then need to constantly renew that vow, in the same way, over and over again, so that the bodhicitta we have aroused does not decline but becomes more and more powerful." The "presence of a spiritual teacher" can be either physical or visualized, based on the various presentations I've encountered. Based on commitment to bodhichitta, one trains in the precepts of aspiration and application. The final fruit is perfect Buddhahood expressed in perfect wisdom and effortless compassion toward all sentient beings - nothing at all limited or 'private' about it! 

Metta is a type of samatha (tranquility, concentration; 2nd training) practice (with a particular object: loving-kindness), so it feels good and has other benefits -- but it does not produce any insight/wisdom. It is not a criticism, it is simply not its goal (just like eating does not produce wisdom, but is still something very useful). I've seen people doing "too much metta", as an escape from looking at negative stuff they had inside, in particular hatred they were unaware of and could not deal with. As you say that it feels addicting, be aware of attachment to those mind-states (attachment to jhanas is removed only at the moment of final enlightenment -- says the theory of 10 fetters) as much as possible. What produces insight/wisdom, and also removes negative conditions (incl. attachments), is vipassana (3rd training). Take good care to do enough Vipassana, that's what ultimately brings more understanding about oneself and better life. 

Swapnil, Love does never conquere anger and hatred but is actually the reason of it. Look how angry you are, aren't you? And why? Love is simply greed and it's not proper to blame another trader of not taking your deal, or? Of course it's not a crime perse, but actally the reason for all crimes in this world. To deal unfair, in cases where others do not like to trade with this dangerous item, lead also often to direct "love-crimes" That is why the Buddha and wise people taught and teach, "Suffering comes from what is dear" and to make best nothing neither dear nor put anger into it. And since no being loves any thing more as him/herself, on should not harm others and derive them from their beloved.
