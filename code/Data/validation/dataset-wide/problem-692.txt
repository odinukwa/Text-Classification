Your final option is to replace the rear wheel hub with a 8/9 speed cassette-based hub. Shopping list of parts 

The high spoke-count wheels look nice but are mostly for show rather than increased load capacity. Notice the front wheel is laced radially and the rear is laced crossed. As such this front wheel would not suit a brake. At least one tyre has been replaced because of the colour and tread difference. Otherwise its a fairly neutral BMX, not intended for stunts or trials. If you like it, just ride it and maintain it. Since you've "just picked it up" try asking the person selling it. If they're the original owner they will know the most. Original paperwork is always a selling point for a bike too, and a service history. I know exactly how many km are in my chain and cassette. 

In my experience. the inner cable will push through a hole in the hand-grip side or the edge facing the ground. There will be a black or grey plastic grub screw that will use a screwdriver, torx or hex key to remove. It won't be tight. The hole will be large enough for the round end of the bowden cable to fit through. Again, if you have this hole then you do not need to remove the top plate. Not a great picture but similar concept, opening an access hole to push the inner through: 

My brifters date from 1997 and are "early tech" When I got it, they shifted poorly, with a really annoying habit of changing down and then not changing back up. I blasted them with brake cleaner and various oils and fluids which helped, but the only fix was a teardown and soak the guts of it in petrol for a day, to soften the old hardened grease. Now it changes like a beast, missing perhaps one shift down in a hundred rather than 19 in 20. These brifters are Shimano RSX 3x7 and they do not have any trim support, so I get clackity if I cross chain, and I can't wheel the bike backwards out of the garage in big/big, it shifts on the front chainring down to the middle. That said, 18 year old brifters cleaned, lubed and reassembled, working fine. Standing back a bit, shifting problems tend to come from every other part except the levers, which are the most reliable part of the transmission system. 

I've had a blast at a social mountain bike race/relay the other week. Our corporate team wants to do it again next year, and in costume too. Question is: Do you think these all-over costumes would work acceptably on an off-road bike race? I'm mostly concerned about visibility (the rider seeing out) and slightly worried about sweat and bunching. Further details: Lap times were 30-35 minutes, so its not a sprint relay. The track was a mostly flat and dry singletrack with some shingle 4wd track. Downtime between laps was while 2x 3x 4x laptime, while other people did their lap. $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ 

Another more expensive option is to add a third brake. Tandems frequently have drum brakes in the hub of the rear wheel, and while they don't really stop the bike, they work to limit the top speed on a downhill. Upsides 

Indexing This step moves all gear positions by tweaking the inner cable. You should be able use your right hand on the gear control, your left hand to pedal slowly in the workstand/air, and see the chain move up and down correctly. If you push to go up to a larger cog/easier gear, and it doesn't quite move far enough, then you need more tension, so back-out the cable adjuster a half-turn. Likewise, let out the cable tension a bit to move the gear selections towards the smallest cog. This can be an iterative step, but once you're right the gears should change from smallest to largest and back again accurately. Then change front chainring and do it all over again. 

Specific to your bike? Nope, no idea. But you can test if its a full housing by push/pulling the housing where it enters the bike and see/feel if it moves at the exit point. This is often visually like a wire disappearing into a wall. By threadding the NEW inner into the OLD outer in place, you can then pull the OLD outer out the back and feed a NEW outer up using the NEW inner as a guide. Its easier to do than describe. If that doesn't help, release the inner wire down at the mech to give you some slack. Then gently pull the outer away from the frame entrance or exit. You will probably see the inner cable disappear into the frame. Try and pop any cap or cover loose. If this works easily, then your bike has no guide pipe inside the frame, because you can tape the NEW inner to the OLD inner and guide it through. You'll want to pre-fit the new outers at the front of the bike first, and probably end up having to cut the head off the OLD cable. The hard thing now is risking whether there's a guide pipe inside the frame. You might get an idea by feeding the OLD inner into the frame at both ends and listening for a "tink" of the steel wire hitting the frame on the inside. Won't help on carbon bikes. If you DO hear a metal tink then its probably not piped inside. If you DON'T hear a tink, means nothing. Basically now you have to pull the inner and then push a new one in and hope that it doesn't drop into the frame. 

Next options cost money, sorry. New commuter tyres is your first and easiest gain. Inflate towards the higher end of the pressure range. Store your old tyres in case you want to take the bike on something offroad and gnarly someday. 

That frame looks rather unusual - Could be worth searching google images for "BMX" till you find something that looks similar. Also the detail of the front gusset looks very unsusual. Not sure if its cosmetic or for strength at the headset. I note the headset has a detangler for the rear brake line, and a Potts mod for the front brake line. However there are no brake pads on the front calipers, so its not going to stop very well. Saddle needs replacing or recovering, and you need air in that front tyre. Based on handlebar angle, the previous rider was way too big for the bike. I'm no BMX expert but based on the construction I'd guess 2000s for the age. Sorry for no better info. 

Training tyres are somewhere in the product line below race tyres but above economy tyres. They should cost around the same as a touring or commuting tyre, cost less than a race tyre, and will cost more than a budget tyre. Training tyres will have more durability than a race tyre, but will be slightly heavier. The idea is to save your valuable race rubber for the race itself, but still ride on rubber that has similar characteristics. That consistency is why tyre makers pair up training models with race models. Personally I have a puncture-resistant touring tyre on the rear of my road bike, because flats suck on a race. I have a $50 training tyre on the front, because its good enough for the little racing I do. If you're weight-weening then saving weight on the wheels is fine, but I can't justify the steep price increases for the minimal gains. 

It just so happens I had one of these land in my garage for a fixup today. So I've taken some photos of how it went. tl;dr Answer Root cause lubrication. The pawl for up-shifting wasn't engaging the teeth. This is for a Right hand shifter, for the REAR mech. I assume a Left shifter for the FRONT mech is similar inside, with fewer teeth. 

Ideally you want the bike to have the same silhouette from the side before and after changing the fork. Breaking that down, you want the same trail measurement before and after to keep handling the same. The top tube should be the same angle from the horizontal before and after, and the wheelbase should be the same. If you fit a longer fork with the same size wheel it will look more like this. Note this is 2 degrees of rotation centered around the rear axle. 

OPINION Drop bars should never have been popular. There was a surge in popularity for the "ten-speed" in the 70s and 80s, and part of that look was drop bars. This artificially made drops seem like a common thing and a good idea. As the MTB arrives in the 90s, flat bars re-exert themselves for the added width and leverage, returning drop bars to their less-common status, where they should have been. Exacerbating this fall-from-cool is that road bikes are getting more slammed or aggressive, with higher seats and lower bars. Compare Fignon in the 1980s: 

No I've not used those specific ones. However I have used spoke-mounted clip-on reflectors, and consider them far superior to the traditional yellow plastic blobs that adorn many new bikes. Reflectors on the wheel make your bike much more visible from the side. Lights are generally not set up to point sideways, and they have relatively little leakage to the sides. Reflective sidewall tyres are okay, but they're a continuous band and don't have the same movement that revolving spoke protectors have. Answer: Sound concept and good idea Pricing? That is for you to decide and we don't really do prices here because the website is global. On looking at the website, they seem to be stickers made of reflective material, similar to whats on a roadcone. Your local craft shop or safety department in a hardware shop probably has rolls of similar reflector tape. 

Sounds to me like your original brake calipers are not suitable for your new front fork, being a bit too long. There are not specific standard lengths, but there are standardish sizes spanned where the brake reaches 32-44mm or 40-50mm. You probably want one size shorter than you have now Possible solutions: * You could possibly file the brake calipers, but depends how much meat you'd have to remove. Not recommended, and not at all if its more than a millimetre or two to remove. 

Hold the handlebars as far out toward the end as you can. This gives more leverage on the steering, meaning you have more control. Not so far you can't reach the brakes though. Try and hold your torso/upper body relatively still. Attempt to use your arms for steering, not your shoulders. Make sure the tyre/tire is inflated fully - mine's 65 PSI. This should reduce the wheel's desire to turn itself, and make the steering lighter to turn back and control That stem (again not quite the right word) has a clamp on it. You can raise or lower the handlebars, and see if that helps. Do this stopped of course. Check your saddle height - its harder to ride anything when the seating position is wrong. 

Buy a petrol kit off ebay and follow the instructions. At that point you fall in a gap between cyclists and bikers, where neither group wants to know about you. Or buy a new bike designed as an ebike. Or buy a nifty-50 scooter/step through motorbike. An electric assist motor is a better idea, the kits cost about the same. Main difference is you're consuming power to charge, instead of burning petrol+oil. Electric is much quieter too, whereas motorised bicycles are incredibly loud because of the small mufflers. Electric kits tend to replace your front wheel, and have a battery bag that hangs on the frame or goes on a rear carrier, or inside a pannier or basket. Good thing about electric is you're still a cyclist. Here's my adventures with such a kit $URL$ 

If you pull the inner wire by hand while spinning the pedals, does the rear derailleur move the chain to all 8 cogs on the rear cassette? (suspend the bike in a workstand or hang from something with a rope to make this easier) Does the shifter (the part on the handlebars) click through 8 different positions as you press the buttons? Can you feel it pulling the inner-wire a little on every click? Sounds like the shifter unit is pogged up and some of the pawls inside are not latching into the teeth. You could try disassembling it, clean all the old lube out with a degreaser/petrol and then re-lube and reassemble. I've done this with brifters and it was hard work but fixed the problem. If that doesn't work, you're probably up for a replacement 8 speed shifter... not too expensive new. Your local bike coop might be able to help too. Fit a new inner cable while you have the chance - they're cheap. 

Experienced riders pick the right chainring based on the terrain coming up. Then all they need to know is to go up or down on the cassette as needed. If you've topped or bottomed-out then that section is over, time to pick a new chainring. 

You haven't explained your need, but there are brake levers that incorporate a switch. These are found on electric bikes, and are normally wired to cut power to the motor if the rider brakes. Some electric bikes will take that signal and cut in electric braking. 

I'd not take this "statement from authority" as an absolute truth. Ask them to prove its impact damage. Depending on your location, there may be ombudsman services or small claims courts where you can pursue them for "failure to honour warranty contract" 

In Christchurch, New Zealand we've had the Lyttelton Road Tunnel closed twice in my memory for pedestrians and riders. Normally its a dedicated road tunnel for cars / trucks / busses. In 1993 and 2014 it was closed for a morning and many thousands of people got the chance to walk through and back. It was a huge success in getting people out, but so many people you couldn't ride through. Even walking was slow. Plus there was a lot of anger in the car drivers who had to take alternate roads up and over or around the hills. 

You will probably need to drop your brake calipers. I did this on my 1981 Raleigh. Despite fitting long-reach Tektro R559 calipers, the back wheel looked like this: 

Something penetrates the tyre/tube and lets the air out. Any road debris can cause punctures, from sharp rocks to nails/staples/screws. Bits of wire seem to be common, as do small flakes of glass from bottles. Its unusual to find safety glass as the cause. Fix: don't ride through junk on the road. patches of gravel should be avoided too. 1b. Spoke ends can cause punctures this way too, if your rim strip is thin and worn or moved or missing. These are obvious because the hole is on the inside of the tube, respective to the valve stem. Fix: file any poke-out bits of spoke flat, and replace the rim strip. The cheap fix is to wrap 2-3 layers of masking tape between the spoke ends and the tube and poke a hole for the valve. Something wears a hole in the tube/tyre and lets the air out. A hole in a tyre can allow the tube to bulge out and make regular contact with the road and wear off. Fix: replace the tyre, or patch the tyre on the inside as a temp fix. Something cuts the tube/tyre and.... lets the air out. Pinch flats from running too-low pressure, sharp-edged potholes in the roadway, or railway/tram rails. Also a poorly-installed tube that gets pinched between tyre and rim. Fix: run your tubes at a better pressure, and stop riding off kerbs/curbs and through potholes. Learn to jump minor things that show up in your path.
