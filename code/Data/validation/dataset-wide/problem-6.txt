Expand quickly initially and then have expansion limited by lack of desire. Most humans live near cities. They might like the idea of more space, but apparently they value nearness to civilization more. There are no cities on frontier planets. So most people who don't leave initially won't be that interested. The initial colonization might happen quickly, as the government could encourage it as a solution to conflicts. Not happy in Syria? Ship them off to New Syria, New Levant, or New Kurdistan. No need for refugees in Europe. Also, there are a certain number of people who find the concept of space colonization appealing. They might power the first few waves. People who reject local laws might move. For example, polygamists might found the planet of Deseret. As these groups establish planets though, they leave fewer and fewer people on Earth with similar beliefs. Or people can choose existing planets. For example, Muslims from the United States might go to New Levant, as there is already a Muslim community there. These are planets. They're huge. Not every community will need a whole planet. Some will be satisfied with a continent or even an island like New Zealand or Madagascar. Not enough population It's also worth noting that in richer countries, fertility has dropped below replacements levels. It used to be common to expect a need for sharp limitations to the number of children per family. But the actual problem is increasingly that there are not enough children. If our population is shrinking, then why expand to other planets? Expensive FTL You can also make your FTL drive arbitrarily expensive to use. Maybe we know how to go to new planets, but most people don't want to pay to do so. Or it requires a resource that is currently singular and no one wants to build a new one. E.g. to fuel an interstellar ship requires a gigantic solar array and takes a year; that's less than four hundred ships total. No one wants to devote the resources to building a second one. No inhabitable planets Most planets may be uninhabitable. So living there might require massive terraforming, which can take centuries. Consider the Earth a mere three billion years ago, prior to the Great Oxygenation Event. There was life on Earth, but it was not anything compatible with us. Most planets might be more like Venus, where the atmosphere would be poisonous to us. Or like Mars, where there is no atmosphere. Alien conflict Perhaps the planets are already inhabited. The aliens tell us that we can have so many planets and no more. We are already surrounded by other civilizations. Beyond our fifty planets, there are no more available. 

The problem with Elysium was that those in space had a higher standard of living than those on the ground. Reverse that. In space, you have smaller quarters and cheaper supplies. Also, reduce the amount of elder healthcare in space. Once someone's done reproducing, they're redundant. Let them die naturally. Long term, the space habitat needs to be self-sufficient. Go ahead and do that immediately. The advantage in space is that your children are guaranteed a place. On the ground you have more space. You take first choice of foods, etc. You get the latest medical and health care. But your children may not be able to find a place on the space habitat. In the near term, the ground is clearly better. That was the fundamental problem with the Elysium concept. If Elysium had such advanced technology, why use ground labor? Automate in space instead. It's cheaper to mine in the asteroid belt and ship into Earth orbit than it is to mine on the Earth and lift out of the gravity well. 

One way to explain this is simply that the different countries have different levels of technological and magical development. So you may have a nominally modern tech country where fantasy elements are hidden (paranormal fantasy). You may have an advanced, purely scientific country, no magic used at all (cyberpunk). You may have a country where they mix technological and magical solutions (steampunk). You may have a country where only magic is used (epic fantasy). You may have some difficulty explaining why the technological solutions don't spread out to the magical countries. One explanation that appears frequently in fiction is that magic breaks tech. For example, Kate Daniels, Wren Valere, and Harry Dresden make electricity work badly around them. For example, Kate often has trouble using a phone. Harry has to drive an old VW Bug because he fries the computers in newer cars (on a bad day, he fries the ignition of the Bug). Perhaps the magical country is awash with ley lines or whatever. The scientific country has none. The steampunk country has lots of low level magical energy. So no modern electricity or internal combustion engines, but it doesn't interfere with steam engines. Your paranormal country may have remote places where magic is available but most of the surface is magic free. Practitioners need to store up magic to use outside of their enclaves. Another solution, used in the Well World series was to make different locations subject to different physical laws. The basic idea was that the physical laws from multiple worlds were to be present in one world. There were distinct borders with different physics on either side. The Hell's Gate series has separate universes (rather than countries). Tech universes are adjacent to each other and magical universes are adjacent to each other. They meet in the middle, where both tech and magic work. But the closer to the tech end, the less that magic works. And vice versa. 

It depends Would this world government look more like the USA? Or North Korea? There's a big difference between the two. If we assume that such a government would look most like Europe, then that's your answer. The world economy would look much like Europe's. Some states would do great. Others would struggle, the way Greece is now. Note that the world government would not have to unify things like regulation and minimum wages. Europe has different minimum wages by country. Also look at the US example. There is a federal minimum wage of \$7.25 with state and local minimum wages as high as \$15. It's also not evident that it will be the first world nations that will struggle under such a system. Note that in Europe, it is Greece, not Germany, that is having trouble with a single currency. It's not that hard to recall currency. Since most currency flows through a bank deposit at least once a year, you can recall currency by simply asking banks to accept the currency item but not give it out. It's also worth noting that bills need to be replaced every few years anyway. United World If we start with a government like the US, then we should realize that we have some challenges. Initially expect the global government to do very little while the "country" governments still do most everything. Over time, there will be a lot of pressure from the less successful areas to get more subsidy from the more successful areas. Since India has more people than the US and Europe combined, India can outvote them in the global equivalent of the House of Representatives. And in the global Senate, the twenty Central American countries would outvote the US and Canada unless they break up into separate states and provinces for Senate representation. In case of breakup, there are fifty-four African nations that would outvote the US states while the Central American countries would outvote Canada's provinces. Europe already has a mix of rich and poor countries. The hope would be that the poor countries would become rich, but it seems just as likely that this would make the rich countries poor. The world GDP per capita is roughly a third of the US GDP per capita, so even distribution without increased production would make the US a lot poorer.
