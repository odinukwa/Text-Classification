With INFO level logging enabled messages will start showing up under /var/log/messages (at least under Red Hat based Distros): 

In the past what I've done is make use of Samba to distribute drivers for different versions of print drivers. I wrote about this in a blog article. 

You can also use to generate formatted numbers sequences too! References & similar tools to If you don't want to use as I've done so above there are some other options available. 

You'd then need to create a corresponding file under called, . You could also forgo doing this and simply override the file itself in the directory. Simply copy the pre-existing file to . NOTE: Be careful in doing the 2nd options, since you'll be overriding the for any jail that may use it. 

I think you could turn this around and not disable the functions in your file but then disable them on a directory per directory basis in either a file or your Apache file, if you're using Apache as your web server. Other web servers most likely offer this feature too. According to this blog post, you can override php flag and value settings in in your file. For example you could do the following: 

This can also be adapted to an automount setup so the mounting/unmounting can be handled by the system automatically via autofs. 

The above could be used to extract a list of IPs from my file. You can of course also use to generate dynamic content too: 

I setup an Ubuntu guest on a CentOS KVM host with initially 6GB of disk space. How do I go about increasing the Ubuntu guest's disk space from the command line? EDIT #1: I'm using a disk image file (qemu). 

Those applications are considered services so you're going to want to do 2 things. First stop them now, you can use the command to stop them. Second you're going to want to disable them permanently between reboots. You can use this command to see all the services available and their state. 

In looking through the source code, there are a couple of things that jump out that would seem to be impacted by running a single command vs. multiple commands. First this comment in : 

This was of course on a smaller HDD (1TB) so as was mentioned in the comments, anything over 2TB will require a different label, and yes you should be using GPT for that. 

You could then grep the output looking for and files if you knew you were using those extensions to name your VM images. 

The easiest to get going is SSH, IMO. Details on how to do it are covered here: $URL$ Ultimately virt-manager is doing the following behind the scenes: 

When this happens one of the members in the RAID array has likely gone out of sync with the array, this is the resyncing check that's occurring and it's 86% complete. When the RAID array is in a healthy state the output will look similar to this: 

One thing worth checking is what version of Jetty you're using. Depending on your version, there is a known issue with certain versions where accessing the server with URLs that do not include a trailing slash "/", will encounter the 400 error code as you've described. See here for more on this particular problem. Here's a link to the actual issue filed on Jetty's bug tracker, JETTY-1553. 

I've tried multiple methods that don't appear to work, but I'm ultimately trying to add multiple external users to a non-POSIX group using the command. NOTE: These external users are coming in via a trust with an Active Directory environment. Usage 

NOTE: The 2nd one is nice because it let's you mix and match different sizes of HDDs into the RAID. Maximum size of RAID? I don't see why you'd be limited. The only limiting factors are the number of physical drives you can fit in the Dell 2900 (space plus open SATA ports), and the speed of the SATA bus (3Gb/s vs. 6Gb/s). Currently I don't think there are any 6Gb/s RAID controllers that the 2900 supports so that doesn't matter here. When adding the disks if they're > 2TB you have to set them up using GPT not MBR! Resources 

Once you're setup your Fedora system so that it will accept remote connections you can use a remote desktop client such as Vinagre, again a Gnome app, from the Applications pull down, Applications -> Internet -> Remote Desktop Viewer. Once this application comes up you'll need to open a connection to a remote server. 

It has a basic man page to go along with it. On my Red Hat based distros (Fedora, CentOS, RHEL) it was part of the stock openssh-client package! 

Restarting glusterd will flush that lock, but I'm at a loss what the above heal command is actually trying to tell me. The logs I find useless since there are several, and are not entirely clear to me which goes with what: 

Any guidance would be appreciated. EDIT #1 It seems as though the system is having issue when it attempts to bring up the corresponding for the brick/HDD that I've added back in. Here's the output of the logfile: : 

If you want it to show up on a shell invocation it needs to go in . The directory is for logins (, or into the box). Check out the INVOCATIONS section of the bash man page if you want more info on the differnces. 

Notice here that they're constructing a general purpose action called, which is made using other variables, such as, , , `%(protocol)s, etc. From the man page: 

EDIT #3 Finally some progress. Came across this project on github called msys_setup which includes a windows port of virt-manager. It's partially functional, doesn't support qem+ssh:// connection type so it's still not usable for our needs, but it's a start. 

I recently replaced one of the HDD's that provides a brick in a GlusterFS cluster. I was able to get that HDD mapped back into a brick, and then get GlusterFS to replicate successfully to it. However there was one issue with that entire process that did not appear to work for me. I attempted to run the "heal" command on the volume with the replaced brick but would continuously run into this issue: 

You can confirm this by ssh'ing into "remoteserver" just like you did originally and try and a file in this directory: 

Using the shell you're options are limited to getting the list of files and then downloading them one at a time using a command like this one: 

Rather than type your password multiple times you can make use of and its switch to prompt for it once, and then feed the password to all the servers in a list. NOTE: Using this method doesn't allow you to use , however, so you'll need to roll your own method for appending your SSH pub key file to your remote account's file. Example Here's an example that does the job: 

On the off chance that you only have access to netcat () you can use it to interact with HAProxy's socket file in a similar fashion to . 

Might I suggest using perlbrew. In general I've found over the years that if you have an application that depends on a particular interpreter: Ruby, Perl, Python, etc. It's usually a better idea to setup a dedicated installation of the interpreter for your application rather than rely on the ones included in a particular distro. Perlbrew maintains an entire installation of Perl in your directory. In fact you can have multiple versions of Perl along with its libraries so that you can perform testing, before you fully upgrade from one version to the next. By doing it this way your application is completely separated from upgrades that may occur when relying on your distro's version of Perl. Excerpt from the perlbrew webpage: 

Shutdown the VM add more space to the guest's "image file" (something like: cat old.img 10G_addon.raw >> new.img start the VM (using the newly created new.img) run fdisk inside VM and delete & re-create LVM partition 

The above lines say connections coming into go to (RewriteRule) and that connections going back out from the proxied server get rewritten to (ProxyPassReverse). 

The --ghost switch creates stubs of mount points even when a given share isn't being actively mounted. Take a look at this CentOS wiki Tips and Tricks page on ways to mount SMB/CIFS shares. Mounting tips 

Finally make sure that any pre-existing files within have their group set to . This can be done like so: 

Bonus material By using you can forgo having to construct files and either provide dynamic content using or you can create a list of IPs using another of 's switches, . For example: 

Basically you want to make use of the variable . This variable contains the return status of the last run command. 

Take care to make sure that the socket file has the appropriate level of access to perform the above. Mainly something like this: 

Yeah this looks like a running out of memory error. But the cause might be due to a buggy driver and not necessarily that you have too little memory. Can you provide more details about what hardware your using on this box? This related problem to bugid #713546 we can see and it's saying the same thing I am: $URL$ I'd go through the hardware that is installed on this system along with making sure that all the OS related software is current and make sure that everything is at its latest versions. Once you've confirmed that, you'll have to try and nail down what is correlated to this error showing up in the logs vs. what's running at that time. 

You should really be using a RAID 5, 6, 10, 50, or 60. Here's some resources to get you started: background info about RAIDs 

The use of was deprecated in v7 of rsyslogd, and you're encouraged to use instead. You can read more about it in this section of the v7compatibility page. 

EDIT #1 Turns out that the above command was valid, I had a typo in my path. If you have a path which includes spaces you can provide them to robocopy's /log switch like so:
