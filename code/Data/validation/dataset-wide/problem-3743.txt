Nope; you need $X$ to be Cohen-Macaulay. Consider $X$ a union of two planes in $\mathbb P^4$, meeting at a point $p$. If you intersect $X$ with a general hyperplane, you get two disjoint lines; in the limit that the hyperplane goes through $p$, the lines collide and give you an embedded point at $p$. So far so good. But now slice everyone with another hyperplane through $p$, i.e. let $(L_n)$ be family of planes, so $L_n \cap X$ is a pair of points until you get to $L \cap X$ which is a fat point of length 3. The basic problem is that the second hyperplane section doesn't drop the dimension of every component; it shrinks each of the two lines to points, but allows the embedded point in without shrinking it (to be (-1)-dimensional, i.e. the empty set). (I haven't thought through exactly why $X$ Cohen-Macaulay should be sufficient to cure such problems, but am sure that that's the right condition.) 

I doubt there are enough such functions, though I could also believe that this could depend on our set theory. 

Start by deformation-retracting $G$ to its maximal compact, so that $G/T$ will be a flag manifold with a Bruhat decomposition, obtainable by Morse theory as in Agol's answer. If what you want anyway is the $\pi_2$, consider the long exact sequence on homotopy of $T \to G \to G/T$, giving $$ \ldots \to \pi_2(T) \to \pi_2(G) \to \pi_2(G/T) \to \pi_1(T) \to \pi_1(G) \to \ldots $$ The first obviously vanishes, and the last does too by assumption. We know $\pi_2(G/T)$ is free of dimension $\leq rank(G)$ by the Bruhat decomposition, so the surjection $\pi_2(G/T) \to \pi_1(T)$ is between free abelian groups of the same finite rank. Hence it's also injective. So its kernel $\pi_2(G)$ is zero. 

The result is the Dynkin diagram of a subgroup H of G of the same rank. Every such subgroup (up to finite factors) arises this way. 

I've spoken about the "puzzles" that Terry Tao and I developed for Schubert calculus, like the left two here: 

In general, I've found it more annoying to deal with the $K$-orbits than their $\varphi$-values, and I'm wondering if this would help motivate gluing them together (at the cost of switching from complex to real algebraic geometry). Of course there is an immense literature on Matsuki duality, so I am hoping for a reference. 

The answer is already no for $G=U(2)$ acting on $Sym^6(\mathbb C^2)$. Given a subgroup $\Gamma \leq U(n) \cong SU(n) \times U(1) / Z_n$, we can enlarge it by projecting to $SU(n)/Z_n$ and $U(1)/Z_n$, take the preimages in $SU(n),U(1)$, and multiply together. The $U(1)$ isn't going to help hold together an irrep so we've reduced to subgroups of $SU(n)$. There aren't so many of these for $n=2$; the cyclic, binary dihedral, and the $E_{6,7,8}$ ones. Their largest irreps are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6-dimensional, i.e. the largest coefficient of a simple root in the expansion of the highest root of the $A,D,E$ root systems. 

1) Section 7 of [Knutson-Tao-Woodward], $URL$ 2) Yes. To obtain the (minimal set of) inequalities, you can just glom the puzzles together. 

What is the family over $X$ induced by pulling back the universal family along $F$? Is there a reasonable way to think about it, that makes it clear that it's not just again the universal family? If that family is just the universal family again, then in what sense is the Hilbert scheme universal? (As it seems I've obtained the same family from two different maps, which I thought wasn't supposed to happen.) 

Let $X$ be a reduced scheme, so, generically regular; you may assume extra conditions like equidimensional and seminormal (though normal is stronger than I'd like, as is Gorenstein). 

It's not. These are constructible as ${\mathbb A}^2/\Gamma$ for $\Gamma$ a finite subgroup of $SL(2)$, and you can recover $\Gamma$ as $\pi_1$ of a punctured neighborhood of the singularity. If you compute that group for a toric surface singularity, it's abelian, whereas for your $D,E$ examples it's not. 

It's kinda gross, but it can be done. To each monomial, add a generic linear combination of all smaller monomials (w.r.t. your term order). Now insist that what you have is a Gr\"obner basis. How do you do this? Apply the reduction algorithm to each S-polynomial, until you get stuck. Then assert that the result is zero. This puts a multitude of algebraic conditions on the coefficients in your generic linear combinations. I hope it's obvious that the resulting set thus constructed, a Bia\l ynicki-Birula stratum on the Hilbert scheme, should be termed the "Gr\"obner basin". 

Consider the polytope of $(n-3)$-tuples $(d_1,\ldots,d_{n-3})$ of nonnegative numbers, such that $(a_1,a_2,d_1),(d_{n-3},a_{n-1},a_n)$ and each $(d_i,a_{i+2},d_{i+1})$ are triples satisfying the triangle inequality. Then the volume of this polytope answers your question. Let $s=\frac{\sum a_i}{2}$. Then there is a formula for the multiplicity of the weight $\vec a$ in the irrep $V_{s \omega_2}$ of $GL_n$, when $s$ is integral. The leading order behavior of this inhomogeneous piecewise polynomial in $\vec a$ also answers your question. 

In general, the only definition I know of GIT quotient is $Proj$ of the invariant ring. The obvious statements one can make about the rational map $Proj\ R\to Proj\ R^G$ are that it collapses $G$-orbits, and if one semistable orbit is in the closure of several others, they all collapse together. Your example is of a very special type, where the action of $G$ can be extended to that of a reductive group $H \geq G$, so instead of worrying directly about the nonreductive GIT quotient $X//G$ we can instead look at $(X \times H//G)//H$ and punt the nonreductivity issue to the more-universal problem of computing $H//G$. In the case at hand, $H = SL_2$, and $H//G \cong \mathbb A^2$. (Note that the map $H \to H//G$ is not onto!) Instead of taking $X = \mathbb P^{2r+1}$, let me keep scaling in abeyance to quotient by later, and take $X = \mathbb A^{2r+2}$. Then $(X \times H//G)//H$ is the affine cone over $Gr(2,r+1)$. What's a little tricky, then, is that this remaining $\mathbb G_m$ action is not acting on said cone by dilation, because it doesn't act on the factor of $\mathbb A^2$ we just attached. Instead we get one of the "weighted Grassmannians" of Corti and Reid. I don't have a more detailed answer than that, but at least this replaces your original $G$-quotient question by a $\mathbb G_m$-quotient question. 

Exactly as Alexander said, this will fail for $G/P$ nonminuscule. The smallest example is the closed orbit $SO(5)/P$ of $SO(5)$ acting on ${\mathbb P}({\mathbb C}^4)$. The $T$-weight diagram of this representation is .1. 111 .1. The representation arises as the space of sections of ${\mathcal O}(1)$ on $SO(5)/P$. If we take the space of sections over the Schubert point $P/P$, we get just the top $1$. The extremal weight vectors you want to kill correspond to the left, right, and bottom $1$s. But to get the Schubert point on the nose, you have to kill the $1$ in the middle too. 

Yes, it can be singular. Your question is a little schizophrenic in that $X$ is algebraic, but your $G$ is not, so it becomes unclear whether you want closure in the analytic or the Zariski topology. The analytic closure is very unlikely to be algebraic, so I'm going to assume Zariski. Let $X = {\mathbb C}^2$, $x = (1,1)$, $G$ generated by $[{4\atop 0} {0 \atop 8}]$. Then the Zariski closure of the orbit $G\cdot x$ is {$ (a,b) : a^3 = b^2$}. 

This won't be a very precise answer, but might still be useful. I have occasionally been able to convince someone that a precise definition is a useful thing because you can know for sure when you've checked it. For example, it's surprisingly involved to define whether a graph is connected, under people's usual intuition: for all pairs of vertices, there exists a finite number $n$, such that there exists a sequence of vertices, such that for all vertices $v_i$ in that sequence, $(v_i,v_{i+1})$ is in your edge set. $\bf But$: once you've gone to the bother of making that precise, it's often pretty easy to show that one or another reasonably defined graph is connected. (Then there's the exercise to show that this connectedness is iff there doesn't exist a separating function onto {0,1}.) 

I believe I have proved that the image of this map is closed. (Sketch: consider the Rees family over ${\mathbb A}^1$ degenerating $M$ to $gr\ M$. Replace each fiber with $Gr(\bullet;A)$ of the fiber, obtaining a family $F$. Let $F'$ be the closure of the subfamily over ${\mathbb G}_m$, so flat over ${\mathbb A}^1$. Then the Bia\l ynicki-Birula map from $F' \to F_0 = Gr(gr\ M)$ has image $F'_0$, even if we restrict the map to the fiber $Gr(M;A)$ over $1$. Hence the map $Gr(M;A) \to Gr(gr\ M;A)$ has image $F'_0$, which is closed in $F_0$.) So one can rephrase: 

Motivated by algebraic geometry, I've come up with a purely combinatorial definition within the theory of matroids. The question is: is this concept known? If you like matroids but not algebraic geometry, skip to the definition below. Let $n\choose k$ denote the collection of all $k$-element subsets of $[1,n]$ (rather than the number thereof). We can and will identify this collection both with the set of $T$-fixed points on the $k$-Grassmannian $Gr(k,n)$, where $T$ is the $n$-torus that acts (unfaithfully), and also with the set of Plücker coordinates. Let $C \subseteq {n\choose k}$ be a subcollection. Then, following Neil White, we can define a subscheme $\Pi_C$ of $Gr(k,n)$ by killing all Plücker coordinates $p_S, S \notin C$. This subscheme is $T$-invariant, and its $T$-fixed points are exactly $C$. Easy fact: if $\Pi_C$ is irreducible, then $C$ is a matroid. The non-Pappus matroid shows the converse is false. (This is my own motivation for matroids -- they serve as combinatorial stand-ins for subvarieties of Grassmannians.) I'm interested in the smooth points of $\Pi_M$, where $M$ is a matroid. Perhaps the most efficient way to describe $M$ is by listing its connected flats $F$, and for each, giving the rank. (Saying that $rank(F) \leq r$ means that for each $S$ that intersects $F$ too much, $p_F = 0$. I'm pretty sure that the connected flats gives the shortest list of $F$s to give all the $S$.) 

Let $Y = P^2 \setminus ${two of its fixed points}, and $X = Y$ with $f$ the identity. Then the fiber over $y$ is a point, but $Y$ is not contractible, I don't think. I'm pretty sure your "has one fixed point" isn't the condition you want, but rather, "every $\lim_{z\to 0} z\cdot x$ exists and is $y$". 

Consider triples $(\lambda,\mu,\nu)$ of dominant weights of $G$ such that the irrep $V_\nu$ occurs in $V_\lambda \otimes V_\mu$. Then this space of triples is closed under addition. Proof. An intertwiner can be identified with a $G$-invariant section of the $(\lambda^*,\mu,\nu)$ equivariant line bundle over $(G/B)^3$. Tensoring two such sections together, we get a third, which is again nonzero because $(G/B)^3$ is reduced and irreducible. (Moreover, this monoid is finitely generated, also not hard to prove with this approach.) 

I'd like to see a complete proof of the simplest version of the following rough statement: "If $f/g$ is a rational function on a reduced scheme ($g$ not a zero divisor), and $f/g$ doesn't have poles in codimension $1$, then $f/g$ is a well-defined function on the normalization." I figure this should be called the valuative criterion of integrality (and if not, then maybe that's my problem). I can't find it in [Eisenbud], [Vakil], [Hartshorne], or [Vasconcelos]. There is a version of it in [Huneke-Swanson], but they're treating the more general case of integral closure of ideals than merely of rings, which obviously I should be able to downgrade from but would rather not if I don't have to. Where should I read about it? 

The complete list is quite short -- at least, up to changing real form. I'll give the compact group version, up to isogeny. A_1 = B_1 = C_1: $SU(2) \cong Spin(3) \cong U(1,{\mathbb H})$ For the first, the adjoint representation gives a map $SU(2)/Z \to O({\mathfrak su}(2))$, which by dimension count has image $SO(3)$. (It maps to $O(3)$ because we're preserving the Killing form.) D_2 = A_1 x A_1: $SO(4) \cong (U(1,{\mathbb H}) \times U(1,{\mathbb H}))/Z_2$. One way to think about this is for unit quaternions to act on all quaternions on left and right, with $(-1,-1)$ acting trivially. B_2 = C_2: $U(2,{\mathbb H})\cong Spin(5)$ A_3 = D_3: $SU(4) \cong Spin(6)$ Both of these derive from the action of $SU(4)$ (and its subgroup $U(2,{\mathbb H})$) on $Alt^2 {\mathbb C}^4$, with image inside $SO(6)$ (respectively, $SO(5)$). Then you get all the others by taking universal covers then modding out by (finite) central subgroups, complexifying, and taking other real forms. For example, the second one leads to $SO(3,1) \cong PSL_2({\mathbb C})$ in this way. (There are more if you think about finite groups of Lie type, e.g. $PSL_2(7) \cong PSL_3(2)$.) ADDED: I forgot to mention the exceptional isomorphisms between "different" real forms of the same complex Lie group. For example, $SU(p,q)$ is usually different from $SL(p+q,{\mathbb R})$, but as André Henriques points out, they agree for $p=q=1$.
