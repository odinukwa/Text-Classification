Question inspired by movies You only live twice and Moonraker: I am Evil Overlord at his best: I am super rich person with net worth of 32 billion US dollars. I already own island and I am making money also by selling space technologies to SpaceX and NASA (so I have knowledge about the tech) Suppose, I want to get rid of all humans in Moonraker style: I will build huge space station on the orbit, get people there and then kill everyone else from the orbit. Can I do it? 

But believe me, having access to your favorite cat video server would be amongst the last items on your wish list, if you actually survive nuclear blast. As I stated in the comments, do at least read about game called Fallout. It touches the idea how life inside bunker might look like 

In Czech language we have term for something which I think would happen. It is called Švarc systém and the link goes to english term which boringly says "misclassification of employees as independent contractors" What does "my own business" mean? To someone it means to buy some product cheap, and sell at higher price. To someone it means to create a product and sell it. And to someone it means to offer their services as lawyer, accountant, or IT professional. My personal opinion would be, that not much would change. "Employees" would turn into "contractors" and there would be no standard form of closing employee contract. Also I expect very low level of state regulation. People would deal everything by closing a contract. As next step, I think you should read on libertarianism, which is economical school of thaught to deal with exactly this idea. 

This concept is sometimes known as "rod from god". The rod would have to actively steer through the atmosphere no matter if the target is moving or not. (Essentially it needs to be a robotic glider.) The way this works is an orbiting satellite (probably orbiting west to east) fires the projectile so that the projectile's orbit intersects the atmosphere. Once the projectile hits the atmosphere, it uses its aerodynamic surfaces to curve its motion (which starts out with a west to east orbit that is very similar to its satellite) downward, toward the target. Without aerodynamic surfaces to cause a sharp turn, the projectile would just careen horizontally through the atmosphere until it had lost most of its orbital velocity. You want to preserve as much of that orbital velocity as possible and change the direction to be aimed at your target. If your target is moving, the projectile needs to track that movement. One really big hurdle for this particular projectile is that it's moving very quickly, and you want it to hit a very small target. How does the projectile know where that target is located? It is presumably radioed the coordinates of the target before it launches, but how does it keep track of target movements once it launches? Optical tracking would require a very powerful telescope. If you want to see human sized targets, that requires adaptive optics and a telescope the size of the Hubble space telescope. Your telescope needs to be in the nose of a hypersonic missile, which is an extremely harsh environment for anything, let alone extremely precise optical sensors and transparent windows. Also, there is cloud cover to deal with, and your hypersonic passage through the atmosphere will produce some amount of incandescent plasma in front of your camera. It probably makes more sense to guide the projectile externally, and just radio coordinate changes up to the projectile. The satellite could presumably do this, unless it's night time or the target is obscured by cloud cover or trees or buildings. Another problem is that the time it takes for the satellite to talk to the projectile gets longer and longer the closer the projectile gets to its target. The one way delay is more than a millisecond, which might be uncomfortably long. I think the ideal situation would be for the projectile to get multiple streams of data, one stream from the satellite, one stream from its own internal gyroscopes and camera, and at least one more stream from a spotter within a few miles of the target who can actually see it. That spotter could be a person aiming a device at the target, or it could be a flying our ground-based drone. Regardless the spotter would likely be shooting a low power laser at the target in order to determine its precise distance from the spotter. Subtracting that distance from the spotter's GPS coordinates derives coordinates for the target. The spotter's scope would continuously radio these coordinates up to the projectile so it could alter its course. The projectile would also have its camera attuned to the exact wavelength used by the spotting laser, and it would steer directly for it as soon as it was detectable. The laser would not be visible to human eyes because it would be infrared. A really good spotter system would also have a camera watching the sky for the glare of the incoming projectile. It would measure the angle between the spotter and the projectile in order to give the projectile more precise information about its current location. Hopefully you're getting the sense that this is all extremely difficult. While I think it's possible to do at our current technology levels, I haven't heard of anyone doing so. I don't think a 100% hit ratio is ever possible with something like this (at least until some new, unforeseen technological breakthroughs occur). When describing this system, you should emphasize the extreme difficulty of its task, and all of the complexity of the data processing that needs to happen for the projectile to hit its target. You should also emphasize the extreme physical conditions involved. The G forces would be extreme. The tungsten aerodynamic surfaces would be glowing white hot. The camera window would need to be actively cooled to delay melting and maintain transparency. Regarding how much damage you could cause with this kind of projectile, it all depends on the mass of the projectile and how much orbital velocity it is able to maintain during its passage through the atmosphere. The wikipedia article you linked to suggests a mach 10 terminal velocity and a kinetic energy roughly equal to the projectile's mass in dynamite. (i.e. a 10 ton projectile results in roughly the same degree of damage that would be produced by 10 tons of dynamite.) In general though, I think it's easy to say that the projectile would produce much more focused and directional damage, whereas the dynamite explosion would produce equal damage in every direction. One other clever trick would be to have the projectile break into zillions of tiny pieces right before it impacts (unless your target is a bunker 100 feet underground). This would increase the size of the affected ground and keep the damage focused on the surface, rather than spread out under the soil. 

And yet... After doing so, they will return home and Taliban will continue plan of attacking the World Trade Center, and George W. Bush will invade Afghanistan (using swords only) ... and so on. To me, ultimately: If everyone will be willing to follow the "no firearms" law, it means world peace After handing out all their weapons, the only plausible way to continue is, that North and South Korea leaders will shake hands and say "we both are Koreans, so why fighting?" Taliban will apologise to US, African leaders (Gaddaffi was still alive to name one) will throw in democratic elections ... And world will become happy place. So, the initial setup cannot plausibly lead to any meele only weapon 

Now, the last two give me troubles. I need to come up with good identifier system which could be believably used in fantasy setup by "turkey plucker" (commoner with really low IQ). Yes, I could steal IP protocol from our world, but it looks too much tech and it assumes that you can count to at least 255. So what would be good addressing system to allow me easily use the mirrors? Such system should be able to hold at least million addresses, preferably one billion unique addresses (magic mirrors are very common and one person can have more than one mirror) 

I would add that the Soviets (and the USA) do not target sites because they have launched missiles. First, any site which has already launched its missiles is of no military importance anymore, so why blow it up? Second, an enemy force has very little real time intelligence during a nuclear war. Even if your silo had launched, the soviets would have no way of knowing. Surveillance satellites could eventually detect launches (although I don't think they could during the brief window in which the Nike missiles were deployed), however it is likely that the very first thing any attacking nation would do when launching a nuclear strike would be to detonate a few multi megaton warheads in low earth orbit in order to create an EMP effect. This quickly results in the destruction of LEO satellites. Third, ICBMs are amazingly inflexible in their targeting. The entire ICBM strategy revolved around attacking stationary targets which have been known about for years. It does not involve retargeting missiles at newly discovered targets. One alternative that I have wondered about is whether the minuteman ICBMs have the secret (and thus untested) ability to serve as anti-ballistic missiles. The scenario would work as follows: An all-out soviet attack would be detected by US satellites and over the horizon radar. (Details depending on the exact year of your attack.) Some portion of minuteman ICBMs are loaded with updated targeting parameters which cause them to detonate maybe 100 (?) miles overhead. The launch is timed to intercept the incoming wave of soviet warheads and destroy them with an X-ray pulse. The timing information comes from SAC. You could have this tactic be as successful or unsuccessful as you need for your story goals. Perhaps it only winds up preserving a single missile squadron? 

You have to introduce some heavenly rules Example, The Good Place Except fallen angels, you can say that human-angel hybrids require more "good points" than usual humans. Or less. Your decission :) Bible can be good rulebook to start Oh my, calling the Bible as a rulebook will not give me any good points, but you have to consider looking into Bible, because:

Question inspired by Youtube video: Game Theory: Fallout Bottle Caps are Worth HOW MUCH?!? I am going to use Fallout world as example, but I would like to discuss general economy terms and not specifically Fallout. So, lets start with Alternate history Earth, in late sixties: World War III happened. It was nuclear and managed to wipe the civilization as we knew it. Some people managed to survive "on the ground" and some managed to survive thanks to the fact that they went to the underground bunkers. Those who survived on the ground managed to rebuild some type of societies. Some are religious, some are governed by dictator, some are democracies. The people on the ground meet, sometimes they fight, sometimes they trade. For whatever reason, all different group of people accept bottle caps as form of currency. No other currencies are accepted, if you do not have any bottle caps, you can barter the stuff you have for stuff you need. Now the question: Can we expect that prices will rise during the time? Things to consider: 

One especially dramatic scenario would be for all plants to die out, resulting in a world populated entirely be 100% carnivorous animals and people eating each other, with a very rapidly dwindling population. Combining this "red in tooth and claw" ecosystem with the perpetual darkness would lead to a terrifying mood! In absolute darkness the population would dwindle way too quickly though, but it could be tempered to have an arbitrarily slow population decay rate by adjusting the amount of light the world receives (and thus the rate of extinction for plants). Another option would be to explore alternative food webs. In the real world, total darkness still allows a few types of ecosystem. There are oceanic plumes which support a food web on chemical energy captured from the plumes by bacteria. In your world I would imagine there are highly magical point sources which emit "life energy", powering small island ecosystems around themselves. The rest of the deep ocean runs entirely on food particles which drift down from the upper reaches (it's called oceanic snow). Filter feeders scoop this up and are eaten by predators. If the darkness in your world is caused by a cloud layer, then there could be some kind of flying or floating plants existing above the cloud deck, powering an ecosystem on the ground with discarded, rotting leaves. Detritivores like earth worms and millipedes would feed upon the leaf mold. Larger animals would eat the detritivores and mushrooms. People would eat everything. This strikes me as another very dramatic option! Cave ecosystems largely run on debris brought in by animals like bats, which leave the caves to feed. Copraphages and detritivores like cockroaches feed off the excrement of the bats (and fungus that grows on it). Check out this piece by the amazing David Attenborough $URL$ Your world could conceivably have aerial access to another realm where the sun DOES shine. Bats, birds, or flying insects might feed in the sunlit realm, then return to the realm of darkness to roost. The sunlit realm might be very tall plateaus which rise above the opaque cloud deck. For example, see the amazing tepuis $URL$ The last real world ecosystem I can think of are the microorganisms that live in the bedrock of the crustal plates. They have extremely slow metabolisms which are powered by chemical weathering of rocks and chemical reactions caused by the heat of the mantle. This ecosystem exists miles down into the earth. It's hard to see how your story could revolve around something like this, but maybe you see a possibility that I've missed? Anyway, my advice is to figure out how your ecosystem is powered first. Everything else (technology, culture, ecology, etc.) will follow from that. 

I have an idea about a person, who knows exact date and time of significant future events. But does not know what is going to happen. And the dates such person knows are significant for culture that person is inside: Example: That person knows exact date and time when new president of USA is going to be elected/announced (meaning the exact date and time after counting of the votes when the rival is going to step up and say: "I lost"). But true name of president of USA is unknown for that person. Also, if there is civil war going on in Zambia and no one inside USA cares, as long as that person is inside USA, he does not know even the date of next bloody event. But once that person travels to Zambia, he instantly knows the date (but still not the event) That person knows all the significant dates up to one year to the future. Of course, some events are guessable (as of presidential elections), but sometimes you have to wait and see what happens on 4th November 2016, 21:30 The dates are "significant" in a way where more than 60% of population of such culture would speak about the event. Which means, you have predictions both about terrorist attacks and say some hollywood class star announcing publically their sexuality. Is there something positive you can do with such ability? Especially if such significant dates for the USA can also be terrorist attacks in Paris (I assume more than 60% of Americans did care about the event), so you can trigger homeland security over "nothing" 

I would point out that the atmosphere doesn't need to be lost to thin out. The atmospheric composition has varied widely over time based almost entirely on gases becoming locked up in soil and crustal rock. The mass of the atmosphere is roughly 10,000 times smaller than the mass of the crust, meaning tiny changes in the way that gases become sequestered can make huge differences in the atmosphere. You might invent a new form of oceanic plant life which is a prolific nitrogen fixer, and composed of a substance which is very difficult for oceanic microorganisms to break down. Just this type of scenario happened during the carboniferous period. During this time plants began producing lignin and suberin in large quantities for the first time. Microorganisms were unable to break down these substances before they became buried. This buried organic material contained huge quantities of carbon (eventually becoming much of the coal available to us today), meaning that the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere plummeted, oxygen levels soared to 45%, and the climate cooled 8 degrees C. I suggest nitrogen in particular because it is 78% of the current atmosphere. I think the phrase you will want to google is "nitrogen sequestration". Here is one example of an article discussing how nitrogen is sequestered currently. $URL$ 

Again, the above is best portrayed in most classical Western movies. The problem is obvious: Is there a way to let people have one mindset for 600 years and then completely ditch that mindset for another? 

(Pun intended) Now on more serious note: Indoctrination is a process Recently, I did read a story which had name Keep washing your clothes: During First World War, there were two opposing armies, being stuck in fortification. No one moves, no one shoots. One weekend, there was music from opposite side. (say German). Then next happy music. Then voice: "Look. We are soldiers, you too. We are being stuck here for weeks, so lets officially cease fire and wash our clothes." Soldiers from another side (say French) did not believe it at once, but then someone stood up and went to wash his clothes. Without being killed. This was repeated for several weeks. Every weekend, there was happy music from German side and soldiers went to wash their clothes together. When Germans really attacked, they faced little, to no defense, because French soldiers were already convinced that these neat people would never ever do anything bad to us 

The magnetic fields have effectively disappeared many times in the past (during periods of magnetic field reversal). This has not correlated with extinction events, so I see no reason to think it would be dangerous at all. $URL$ Also, the current magnetic field funnels charged particles down onto the poles, yet the animals living at the poles seem unaffected. 

If we can survive 600 years, humanity will have discovered lots of really powerful biotech. With that they could make humans who can hibernate for years at a stretch, and humans who can freeze solid without cell damage. Those are the most efficient. If your passengers want to be alive, this level of biotech would allow them to grow stem cell meat for sure, and almost certainly have engineered micro organisms which can grow on primitive feedstocks and self-assemble into nearly any flavor or texture. 

It seems that you are positing that the cost of methane, fresh water, and electricity will plummet in the region around the Sahara. Based on this premise alone, fossil fuels would not necessarily disappear. The most expensive fossil fuels (e.g. oil shales) would be shut down, but existing, land-based oil wells are extremely inexpensive to run and would continue to produce oil even at very low market prices. An inexpensive source of alternative energy would make it much easier to pass anti-fossil fuel legislation in an effort to reduce climate change. I will assume that such a law goes into effect, and that it is enforced successfully across the entire globe. When wealth comes from fixed resources which are tied to geography, the result is usually an oppressive regime and tremendous wealth/power disparities. In the feudal era lords became the government because they controlled agricultural land. They did not control the tradesmen in the cities because those people were highly mobile and could take their wealth generating ability with them. In the modern era most nations where mineral wealth represents a large proportion of the GDP come to be governed by whatever small group of people control that mineral resource (often oil). This is the case in Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, Russia, The Central African Republic, etc. If a fairly small group of people is in control of this Sahara Project, it will rule in an authoritarian manner. Employees and other residents of the area will not have strong rights such as freedom of speech. Owners will appoint the judges or whatever arbiters are used for the legal system. There will be no rule of law governing disputes between owners and everyone else, as the owners will always win every dispute. There might be rule of law governing disputes between non-owners though. The ownership class will get away with rape, murder, assault, and theft. Their children will be enormously wealthy and immune to law, but will often have no real power until their parents reach retirement age. Held in a state of perpetual adolescence their behavior will be terrible. Politics among the ownership class will be cutthroat as everyone will jostle for power in the absence of an objective rule of law. Despite what you say about there not being locals to displace, every piece of land (with the possible exception of Antarctica) has people who consider it theirs. The owners might be miles away, but they exist. It is very likely that the project would proceed as follows: A large foreign company (backed by massive injections of private capital) approaches the local people of each region of the Sahara and negotiates a deal with them. Normally the locals would receive little compensation in these types of contracts, but foreign lawyers rush in to represent the locals for no cash up front but a huge share of revenue. Thus the locals are able to negotiate very lucrative joint ownership contracts with the company. In the ensuing years the cleverest locals are able to buy out other locals using a wide variety of clever business tactics. When ownership finally stabilizes, a very few families control most of the land and become the de facto royalty (similar to the establishment of the house of Saud). The rest of the local families form a long tail of mid level and small time nobles - much wealthier and more powerful than workers, but trivial compared to the royalty. The ownership class will consist of the native land holders, major company shareholders, the company board and officers, and the lawyers who helped the land holders negotiate the deal. Labor, both skilled (there will need to be engineers to install, maintain, and troubleshoot the facilities) and unskilled, will be non-citizen resident workers. They will have few rights, and will not be allowed to retire in the Sahara. Their children will not have citizenship. Any adult without a job (or a spouse with a job) will be forced to leave. Any child without employed parents will be forced to leave. The Sahara company will need to run its own military as the facilities will be very vulnerable to sabotage, terrorism, and military attack. Pipelines and power lines can be bombed. Solar panels can be destroyed by nearly anything. Electrical substations in particular are extremely vulnerable to attack. If the Sahara can do this, then other deserts would likely be almost as good and would replicate this economy. Expect large rival projects in the Atacama, Australia, southern Africa, the Namib, Mexico, and the US southwest. The Gobi will be able to produce huge amounts of power, even if water is not convenient. The old oil powers will experience upheaval. Smart families will be among the investors in the Sahara company (and its competitors). Stupid families and nations will just become poor and irrelevant. Oil will still be used for plastics and lubricants, so it will not go away, but its price will plummet. Plastics, in particular, will become extremely inexpensive. The governments of the oil nations will be overturned. These nations will become much more normal, with governments which are controlled by a wide variety of industrial and commercial powers rather than just a tiny minority of oil powers. The behavior of these nations would become less outrageous as they adopt policies more in line with what makes business leaders happy. (i.e. stability, rule of law, free markets) Coal has never comprised a large fraction of any nation's GDP and its collapse will not result in major changes to any nation state. Coal will have essentially no use in a post-fossil fuel economy. The same goes for natural gas. Norway and Alaska will face financial crises and be forced to cease their negative taxation programs. You mention the electricity being sold to Africa, but a large portion would also go north, under the Mediterranean to Europe. The cost of power increases with the length of transmission lines, so there would be a gradient of electricity prices based on distance from deserts. Wherever electricity is cheapest, massive aluminum smelting operations will be established. If the average price of power across the globe decreases, then so will the cost of aluminum (as well as titanium). Aluminum smelting operations produce enormous quantities of waste heat, which could presumably be used in the already existing water purification plants. Having massive quantities of cheap, fresh water available in areas with plentiful sunshine and warm temperatures would result in an ideal agricultural environment. The price of food should plummet as Saharan vegetables become common ingredients at the dinner table. The change in albedo and evaporation rates this would produce in the deserts would cause unpredictable climate changes. Winds would move a little differently, and rainfall would happen in different places. In general though, the net result would be a slightly wetter, not a drier world - especially in the areas around the desert zones. It is very unlikely that the national borders of the desert regions would be redrawn, so I think you should assume that the nations containing large amounts of desert would become much more powerful. This would include Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Morocco, Oman, Yemen, Syria, and Iraq, but also Namibia, and Chile. I think you should have Saudi Arabia be one of the smart oil powers which smoothly parlays its oil wealth into Sahara Project investments. Russia seems likely to wind up a very big loser in this transition. It has little access to solar power, and has hobbled its industrial and commercial economies with crazy oil-state authoritarianism. This could be awkward as they still have one of the largest nuclear arsenals in the world. Perhaps the US and China restart the Clinton-era policy of purchasing Russian fissile material from old nuclear warheads? (If you're not aware, during the 1990s the USA purchased huge quantities of uranium and plutonium from old Soviet warheads, and then burned this material in US power reactors. In exchange Russia gained much needed cash during their transition from communism.) 

EDIT: Burning down my house? Did I go mad? No, not at all. First, the Stone Age in the title caused me thinking that the population of the humanoids is really low. So, basically, there have to be big unhabited areas - perfect spot to burn them down. Obviously this strategy has some downfalls, but, I am in anti-hippie mode. So stop hugging the trees and burn them :) EDIT 2: But you would not burn down your house, would you? No, I would not burn down my own home. And I do not expect the tree people do the same. I am just expecting them to provide some space for themselves. See this quickly drawn picture: 

When talking about magical Orbs or Mirrors, we have mostly in mind above picture. Skilful mage operates hard to obtain device. But what if Shrek 2 approach would be in place? 

Poor idea which jumped out right now and I have to put it down: The time machine actually works only on time scale of our space-time continuum. Which means that while your engine bends time, it does not bend any space. But hard thing is, that in that case you would end up somewhere else because of all the rotation of our belowed planet Earth. So, you could explain it by loads of time-travelling cycles: The machine itself makes sure it ends up on the same place by travelling small amount of time in every step. Say, every millisecond, you travel 10 milliseconds in time. So in 100 milliseconds, you travelled one second in 100 time travel jumps. EDIT Idea of my second though is to adjust your position in every micro-time-jump. So, you do move in space, but in all, you moved about one millimeter, so you end up on almost same place as you started. If the time machine is relatively huge, then one millimeter in space can be considered as same place
