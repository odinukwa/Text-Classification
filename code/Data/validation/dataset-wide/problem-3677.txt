Your doctor is correct, see this website: $URL$ After about day 5, the energy taken from fat stores is the greatest. If you continue to fast longer than 5 days, the proportion of muscle burnt begins to increase. 

I have learnt from this site that weight training that involves lifting few repetitions (e.g. 6) of heavy weights will result predominantly in muscle strength increases, where as lifting many repetitions of lighter weights is useful for muscle hypertrophy. Naturally I would think that for weight training for improving power in the sport of tennis, one would be more concerned about strength than hypertrophy and therefore perform less reps, but with greater weights. In tennis however, muscle endurance is also important, which leads me to think perhaps more reps will provide benefit. I wish to improve my power in tennis, should I focus on max weight and less reps, or medium weights with more reps? 

Suppose one wishes to start an aerobic workout routine. Assuming one is young and without illness, is a 30 min a day workout (approx 15 min jogging and 15 minute walking intermittently) a reasonable workout routine, or should rest days be initially scheduled? If rest days should be scheduled, how many per week would be recommended? Would you recommend the number of rest days being reduced over time? 

You should be to try and get your circadian rythm back on track. This is not a quick fix, it requires patience and effort, but should be your best bet. The first order of business is basic sleep hygiene. Try to go to sleep at the same time every day. Avoid anything that interferes with your sleep, such as 

You have a kettlebell. For god's sake, swing it! Some people call the kettlebell swing the king of exercises, and not without reason. When it comes to packing a good training for almost your whole posterior chain (interested in a strong back and buttocks of steel?) and some high-intensity cardio into a short time-frame, the kettlebell swing is without equal. Since your current workout kind of neglects your posterior chain, swings would make an excellent addition. A word of caution: The kettlbell swing, as most free weight exercises, requires proper form to be safe. Specifically, you need to keep your back straight. You can't strengthen the back without, well, without using it. While incorrectly performed swings could hurt your back, the benefits of proper swings for the back far outweigh the risks. Also, with just 16Kg you have some margin for error. You're not deadlifting 400 pounds. Instructions are abundant on youtube. $URL$ 

Background Information: I recently began a running/walking regime that lasts for 30 minutes. I think I run about half the journey and walk the other half of the journey. There are 2 very steep hills, and numerous medium hills on the journey. I tend to walk up the 2 very steep hills. Question: On my walk I noticed that some other people walking had very large/bulky (although doesn't look fat) looking legs. My observations of endurance athletes are that they have quite lean legs. I am weather my regime will turn my legs bulky, or if they will remain lean looking. (I would prefer if they don't become bulky, how can I prevent this?) 

I have heard that weight training can be a good strategy for reducing body fat. If one's goal is to reduce total body fat, should one's weight training program be aimed at muscle hypertrophy or building muscle strength? 

What you need to do is eat less, and exercise more. Eating less is far far far more significant a factor for weight loss than exercising more. If you fast 1 day a week, you might burn about 8000kJ (check out a metabolism calculator for your exact daily metabolic rate). If you want the same results through exercise you'd need to run 30 minutes, every day, for a week at medium to high intensity. So what's easier, fasting 1 day a week, or intense running 30 minutes a day for 7 days? Clearly both could be done, but reducing calories is a much more efficient way to lose weight. In addition to fasting 1 day a week, you could cut your calories in half every second other day. This would lead to a calory deficit of 20 000kj. Add 1 hour a day of running to your routine and your deficit becomes 36000kj, which is approximately a 1kg a week loss of fat. 

But you should still go outside and find yourself some bar to to a pull-up with, like on a playground. Carry-over from a similar exercise is not as good as the real thing. 

The whole saturated=bad thing appears to be old junk science. It appears now that monounsaturated fats are good, saturated fats are good when they come from high quality sources (most don't: grass-fed vs. grain-fed, hormones, antibiotics...), and that polyunsaturated fats are only healthy in small amounts. They tend to oxidize and go rancid. The short shelf-life is kind of a tell. Also, with polyunsaturated fats, there seems to be an imbalance: A Modern diet contains way too much Omega-6 and too little Omega-3. 

There are plenty of possible reasons, here are my two best guesses: No. 1 is an anterior pelvic tilt. Modern lifestyles with lots of sitting and shoes with heels lead to tight hip flexors, which lead to a tilted pelvis, a hollow back and a protruding belly. 

My long term goal would be to lose about 10 kg of fat, but I would also like to gain more muscle mass. I am about to begin a training program. I have seen on this forum that it is difficult to lose weight and gain muscle at the same time. In light of this, do you think I should focus on first losing the 10kg of fat, followed by gaining muscle mass, or instead focus on gaining muscle mass, and then lose the 10kg of fat? Some of you might be critical that these two suggestions are too simplistic, and if you would prefer a more complicated mixture of the two, I welcome those suggestions as well. 

Any diseases that causes excess water retention could cause you to put on weight (which include many diseases)or any disease which causes bowel obstruction. These are two examples. Also, perhaps the liquid sarcoplasm in your muscles has increased. No calories are required to increase the amount of water stored in your muscles, which will also add to your weight. Elevated exertion is responsible for sarcoplasmic hypertrophy the same as for myofibril hypertrophy. Basically, your body compensates for the extra stress by increasing the size of capillaries feeding the muscles so that they receive more fluid and, therefore, more energy. When such reoccurring periods of trauma occur, such as during regular workouts, the body triggers the sarcoplasm to retain and store more glycogen and ATP for future use as energy to meet such demands. 

As for Olive Oil, these workoutmasters are probably wrong, though. Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fats, and while it does contain Omega-6 polyunsaturated fats, it is relatively low in them. This makes it the good kind of vegetable oil. I've never seen anything pointing to monounsaturated fats being bad. Looking beyond the macro, good olive oil contains some mighty beneficial micronutrients like polyphenols. $URL$ 

and dumbbell rows which you can do with various heavy objects that have a handle, like a bottle-crate (preferably the kind that has the handle in the middle). 

As for something completely different, your digestion can also cause your belly to produde. A bloated stomach is not flat. 

Fixing this requires attack from multiple angles, there are many muscles involved here, not just the hip flexors. Ideally, you'd find out where your weakest links are and target those. In general, I'd recommend strengthening your glutes and stretching your hip flexors. There are many ways to strengthen your glutes. Kettlebell swings or deadlifts are compound exercises with a strong emphasis on the glutes. I'm not sure squats would work as well, they don't use the whole posterior chain in the same way that swings or deadlifts do. Glute bridges and hip thrusts are a more focused approach. There are also various ways to stretch your hip flexors. The classic is the lunge stretch. But be careful to do it with good form, or you'll just hyperextend your lower back rather than stretch your hip flexors. Tim Ferris is quite enthusiastic about Supine Groin (progressive) stretches from the Egoscue method. 

I have recently read on this Q & A site that the rule of thumb that 37 000kJ is required to burn 1kg of fat is incorrect. I have been down-voted by some for quoting this figure. Is it true that the above relationship is a rough estimate of fat loss, or has it been shown to be untrue. I'm interested in seeing any studies you can give that indicate your point of view. 

It is estimated that about 36% of deaths from CAD in men and 38% of deaths from CAD in women are due to lack of physical activity. To produce the maximum benefit the activity needs to be regular and aerobic. Aerobic activity involves using the large muscle groups in the arms, legs and back steadily and rhythmically so that breathing and heart rate are significantly increased. It is recommended that adults should participate in a minimum of 30 minutes of at least moderate intensity activity (such as brisk walking, cycling or climbing the stairs) on 5 or more days of the week. 

That machine is called a barbell and you need to deadlift it. Deadlifting is not something you can start doing without learning it first, like you might with a machine. But no machine can teach to how to lift heavy weights without screwing up your back, learning how to deadlift will teach you exactly that. Find yourself a powerlifter or trainer at your gym, have them show you how the deadlift works, and let them check and correct your form. The basics are easy enough to learn though, you can do that from a book or online. Of course, you can deadlift anything you want, like kettlebells, instead of barbells. The farmers walk would be a great complementary exercise to the deadlift for your purposes. 

Your description is rather vague, I can't even tell if the pain points to a problem with a muscle or with connective tissue (like the mentioned tennis elbow). One thing I do remember Pavel emphasize is that when you catch the kettlebell in a ballistic movement (like the lowest point of swings, cleans or snatches), you should do it with the arm fully extended (triceps flexed), or you might hurt your elbow. I usually have slight elbow-pain* when I take a long break from kettlebells and then start again. I then take it a little easy (especially with snatches), and it goes away. Something seems to need time to adapt. *haha, I'm just as vague
