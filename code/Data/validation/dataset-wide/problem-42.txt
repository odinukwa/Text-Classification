1000 times the speed of light means you can visit something 500 lightyears away in a one-year round trip. 5000 lightyears would take a decade and you are still not even leaving our galaxy. In contrast some things that can be observed with telescopes are millions or even billions of light years away. So astronomy would still need telescopes! [Edit, added months later since people like my answer] FTL would in fact be a huge boon to astronomers with telescopes mounted on an FTL ship. One reason is that they could fly with a telescope to peer around local obstructions: clouds of gas or dust, nearby bright stars in exactly the wrong place. And once you knew where (say) a supernova had happened, flying away from it faster than light would let you watch it develop during the preceding hours, days, and years. But more radically our Sun is a wonderful light-collector if you can get far enough away from it: $URL$ Summary: if you could quickly travel 70 billion miles away from the Sun in any direction, you could then use the Sun as a gravity lens to look in (approximately, and only) the opposite direction. (You'd still need a conventional telescope as well, to gather light collected by the gravity lens). For scale, Voyager 1 is only 11 billion miles away, but it's mere light-days not light-years. 

Two scenarios which really scare me. Both are described far better than I can in the back-story of Vernor Vinge's a Deepness in the Sky. Omnipresent surveillance. We are already a long way down this path. What will happen when literally every action you take is recorded forever, when advanced algorithms are deployed to comb all that data for anyone who is not fully conforming with the way that they are supposed to be living? My view is that it leads inevitably first to a tyranny worse than North Korea, and then to the complete collapse of civilisation. Over-optimisation. In some ways this is even scarier as it is a road to hell paved with the best intentions. Society continues to automate and to deploy weak AI to manage everyday resource allocation and logistics. We appear to be entering a golden age where we can work less and play more. But the robots are creating an ever more optimised system of increasing complexity lying ever closer to the "edge of chaos". One day we slip over the edge and the entire civilisation falls apart. Perhaps we need terrorists and nationalists to inject enough local inefficiency to stop this latter disaster. Trouble is, the push us down the path to the former. The third possibility that scares me is that of environmental collapse. Other answers cover this so I won't expand, other than to say that slow environmental degradation could be the route to the collapse of an over-optimised global society. 

One answer is that we don't know the effect of high-G in the long term. We do know the effects of high blood pressure. Not good. Under 3G, standing or sitting, your brain needs a certain normal pressure so you do not black out. Your heart is about 40 cm lower in your body. Two extra G adds a pressure on your heart of 80 cm of water or about 60 mmHg. You'll die quite a bit sooner on average. As for the added pressure on the arteries in your legs ... It's also known that tall people are at greater risk of brain injury if they fall over. Falling in 3G will be life threatening even for short people. Broken limbs far more common. Long term arthritis awaits. So if it's not lethal in the short term I'm quite sure it would wreck your health in the longer term. 

The short answer: I think it's very unlikely with today's technology. But there are two ways to interpret the question. Do you mean a machine that can be mothballed today and persuaded to work again in 3000 years time? Or a machine that can remain in service for 3000 years, with regular maintenance? A mothballed machine is in a different state to that it was designed for. Lubricants will drain out from between moving parts. Slow chemical changes will take place. Classic car enthusiasts occasionally find a car that was abandoned in a barn or suchlike decades ago. Although it has been protected from the elements, it will take a lot of work if it is to be made roadworthy again. The battery, obviously, will be dead. A lead-acid battery discharges itself in less than a year and then sulphates, making it unable to take a recharge. The rubber components (tyres, belts, wipers) will have rotted. Rubber degrades in air. In general it's not regarded as safe within a decade and is no longer rubbery but hard and brittle within three. Less obviously, not only will the bearings no longer be lubricated, but they may well have seized. Slow chemistry can cause metals in contact to weld together, or lubricants to oxidize and polymerize into glues. The engine will need careful dismantling, cleaning, and reassembly, with some replacements. This, after fifty years. After two hundred, will it still be possible to obtain a lead-acid battery? Or the tightly specified fully-synthetic oil that most modern cars require? Or a compatible tapered-roller wheel bearing? Or even the gasoline to make it go? By then we expect the internal combustion engine to be rather quaint history, and everything to be running on renewable electricity. (That, or society to have collapsed back to the mediaeval level or worse, due to global warming and environmental degradation, and the old car will be beaten into a ploughshare or something). After three thousand years? Sorry, I think any but the most simple of mechanical devices will have by then become inoperable past the point of being restored. Any interest will be archaeological, or if society has collapsed, possibly the inspiration for an engineer who can puzzle out what the old heap was for and then build a new something. (I'm assuming that it's been kept in a very stable and dry environment. If it's made of iron in a damp environment, it may well be a heap of rust rather than a recognisable mechanism! ) Now, what about a continuously maintained mechanism? I believe that the oldest continuously working devices in the world are clocks and windmills. The oldest clock is believed to be in Salisbury Cathedral, dated 1384. There is some uncertainty in that records from that far back are not good and the design of church clocks did not change significantly for the next century at least. But if it's not this one, there are plenty of other candidates from the 1400s. At least one will be an original. The astronomical clock in Prague is well-documented to have been built in 1420. (It was seriously damaged during WW2 and restored ... is it still the original)? In Iran there are some windmills, still in use, that are in buildings probably constructed during the 6th century. The simple mechanisms are built of wood, leather and suchlike. It seems most unlikely that any components made of these materials and used daily can be 1500 years old. So at what point does a regularly maintained machine cease to be original? When the design is altered? When the last original component is replaced? Later? (At the atomic level there is almost certainly nothing at all in you that was there when you are born. Most of the atoms of living tissue are replaced within six weeks of now. But we remain the same people). Many mechanisms last a century (without major replacements) and are working just fine when they are scrapped. They've become obsolete. There were many steam locomotives built in the 1850s that were in service in the 1950s. Then along came diesels, and electrification. A few are still working, courtesy of railway preservation societies. They're just no longer mainstays of the transportation industry. For how many more centuries will anyone be interested in maintaining a steam engine in working condition? Ditto, a windmill? And finally, there's the life of the society to consider. 3000 years is a long time. Few if any human societies have lasted that long. None, without massive social upheavals involving considerable destruction. Climate change happens on a shorter timescale. It's just about possible that a clock will survive 3000 years given occasional maintenance. It's something that is has been good enough since the 1400s, will stay good enough as long as people remain big-brained apes. A clock moves and wears out slowly and an old one does not need any technology higher than the mediaeval to maintain it. But will the church or other building that it is part of last that long? The omens are not good. The Pantheon in Rome is probably the oldest building continuously maintained and used, and it's about 2000 years old. Earthquakes, fires and wars will continue to take their toll. Which is why I don't think it will make much difference if we can engineer (say) clock components that will last three thousand years of use without needing replacements. It's what's around the clock that won't last the distance. In many places, not even the geology will. What's left of Roman London is now ten to twenty feet underground. 

Since these technologies are both fictional, you can make up any rules you want. However, I think that the laws of economics, as applied to moving around on Earth, will generalize. (Also the laws of force and conflict). So, the key parameters: Speed. It seems reasonable that, in the same starship, it takes twice as long to go 200 light-years superluminally as it does 100. It also seems reasonable that with a jump drive, it takes a constant set-up time to get to and from spaceports to jump-points, and the jump is instantaneous. So time per journey is constant, up to the maximum range. Sensible times could range from hours to years per journey. ("Teleportation" with effective zero set-up time would be a military nightmare and probably leads to first-strike armageddon). Different speeds? Can a starship make a quicker journey at added cost? Or is there effectively one and only one speed? Boats have a very limited ability to go faster. Cost. What does it cost per kilogramme of freight? And is distance, within range limit, a significant price factor or not? Range. What is the range limit, before a starship has to stop to be refuelled or overhauled? (Also, is "Earth" the only place such an overhaul is possible, either because of its complexity or for political reasons? ) Scale. How small is the smallest possible starship? How large is the largest? Here on earth, there is a maximum size for an aircraft set by the materials-science impossibility of making a rigid wing much wider than that on an Airbus 380 or large military transport. (Smallest is inches, or millimeters using related technologies). Communications. Is there a means of superluminal communication other than sending packets on a starship? If there is, what does it cost per bit transmitted? Predictability. Consider steamships versus sailships. A steamship's journey time is fairly predictable, only the very worst weather will slow it down. A sailship's journey time is not nearly so predictable. Safety. Is interstellar travel as safe as today's air travel? Or as dangerous as that of an early settler to the colonies that became the USA? If significantly dangerous, does that depend on a human crew's skill? Or is it a matter of pure, ramdom luck? Detectability. (Military implications). Do starships betray their transit by creating detectable "wakes"? If so can anything intercept them in transit, or immediately on emergence from transit? Note: depending on how you set these parameters, it's quite possible to have a universe where jump and superluminal drives co-exist. We still have ships here on Earth, despite aircraft. We still have trains, despite trucks. 

The problem with most suggestions for advanced materials is whether they could be grown and repaired by a biological system. Many are not at all biologically compatible: embedded in a body they corrode or cause inflammation or other adverse immune responses. We can make bone replacement implants from titanium and certain ceramics. Our biology tolerates these but cannot maintain them, and more surgery is needed when they wear out. Much medical research is directed at how to create a temporary framework that can be seeded with bone cells and implanted, to grow into natural bone with ultimate metabolism and elimination of the framework. Bone, as already mentioned by others, is comparable to.mild steel for its strength to weight ratio. It is also a living tissue, continually repairing itself so that micro cracks do not propagate into fractures (c.f. metal fatigue!) It can grow, repair after severe damage, strengthen in response to repeated heavy stress. Hundreds of millions of years of evolution may have produced the optimal skeleton. What about plants? Different requirement, different solution. Wood. Cellulose fibers bonded with lignin. Again, can be extremely strong. Now we have artificial glues to match lignin, we can re-form wood into "glulam" beams, which are pretty much the equal of structural steel. Interestingly heartwood is not living tissue. A tree protects it from external attack with a skin of living tissue, but in most mature trees it is rotting in the centre. Which does not matter to the tree, or which may even be of benefit. A cylinder is as strong as a solid trunk. As the core of the trunk rots, nutrients that were locked up in the heartwood are released back to the tree's roots. Droppings from creatures that take up residence in the trunk provide more nutrition. Eventually of course rot gets the upper hand and the tree dies if it cannot regrow from its roots. Death is part of nature's plan. Insect exoskeletons and fungi use chitin, yet another remarkable biological material, though one better suited to small elastic structures than large ones. In short, I think it likely that the materials evolved for skeletons cannot be bettered by purely biocompatible processes. 

No-one has yet mentioned the possibility of an acceleration tank. If a passenger is immersed in a strong rigid tank full of liquid with pretty much the same density as human tissue, the effective G-force is reduced to one depending on the difference in density between the liquid and the human tissue. We're mostly water, so water is a good match. Bones are denser, but bone and bone connective tissues are tough because that's their purpose. Lung tissue is probably the most vulnerable - it can't be filled with water, because we have to breathe air, and it's delicate. Shockwaves from large bombs kill by rupturing lung tissues. But do we have to breathe air? There are chemically inert chloroflourocarbons which can cary a large amount of dissolved oxygen. A rat can be submerged in such a liquid and can "breathe" it for a considerable time. I don't know whether it's been tried on humans (and if it has it may be classified secret). An emulsion of such a CFC in saline has medical approval as an emergency blood substitute for when no compatible transfusion is available. Anyway, I'd guess at something like 10G breathing air in a water tank and maybe up to 50G breathing an oxygenated CFC liquid. The weight penalty for an acceleration tank is very considerable (many times greater than a passenger or pilot), so the idea has never been practical in aviation or spaceflight. However, if there's a very cheap source of energy for propulsion, maybe it could then become practical. 

High phosphorus content in the iron they were using. This is something that could happen accidentally as a quirk of the local iron ore or this people's way of smelting it. The result is that as the metal weathers, a protective coating develops. Look up the "Iron pillar of Delhi" for further information. In modern times the same trick has been used deliberately to manufacture weathering steel which develops a thin patina of rust but which does not corrode further. 

I would hope that they'd be coming at renewable energy from the other direction to us, as the way for them to have a sustainable industrial revolution. On the other hand it's possible that wouldn't have happened, and quite likely that it won't happen for another century or few. What won't have happened in that world is an industrial revolution based on steam engines, which make very inefficient use of combustion energy. With only wood and charcoal to use, steam won't replace water- and wind-mills as mechanical motive power, and the industrial revolution will be delayed. What I hope will happen is that the values of the Enlightenment will still be at work, and scientific enquiry into the propreties of magnetic and electrical phenomena will find their Faraday, Maxwell, and Tesla and Edison. The electrical generator and the electric light-bulb and the lead-acid battery will be invented, the generators being powered by water-wheels and windmills, and later by water turbines and (small) dams. It will happen, given that prior to the light bulb, they don't even have gas-lights, just (vegetable) oil lamps and tallow candles. Once they have utility electricity for lighting, low-powered electric gadgets will follow, and the spirit of scientific enquiry will start investigating what electricity is actually made of. Electric motors will give them vacuum pumps. The electron will be discovered. Then the thermionic valve, and radio. Where I'm not so sure is whether they'll yet have scaled up hydro-power to large hydroelectric dams. The engineering princuples are obvious, but you'd have to burn a lot of trees to make enough concrete and iron rebar to build a large dam. That might hold things back until someone very rich was convinced that the huge investment was justified. Meantime, in the research labs, will someone have found how to make a decent solar cell? That's their next key development, if they are to reach our level of technology. Once they can harvest sunlight without the inefficiencies of plantlife, they'll have all the electricity they can use. (The Earth's current electricity requirements could be satisfied by covering less than five percent of its deserts with solar panels). En route, they may have discovered solid-state electronics, but if they come at solar cells via chalcogenides or tellurides, maybe not yet. (These are easier than ultrapure silicon in a society with much higher energy costs than our own). I don't think they'll have obtained practical nuclear power yet, unless their planet is younger than ours (naturally fissile Uranium without enrichment). Uranium enrichment requires prodigious amounts of electricity in, before you have enough sufficiently enriched uranium to get started. In our world, it was probably WW2 and the cold war which made nuclear power happen (as a side effect of making atomic bombs). In a lower-energy world, world wars would probably lie in their future not their past. (Mind you, small wars are no less deadly if you are fighting one).
