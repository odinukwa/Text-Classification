Tactically the only use I could picture would be crowd/riot control, think police not military. I could see these vehicles being fairly effective against a poorly armed and disorganized mob. Their height and high visibility makes them somewhat imposing to civilians. Their primary purpose would be to intimidate and corral much like mounted (on horseback) police in these situations. Think about it, the empire is probably accustomed to putting down minor civilian uprisings on a fairly regular basis, it would make sense for them to have purpose built vehicles for the task. Think of the At-at as more of a paddy wagon than a tank. 

I suppose you could just scale up assault rifles, but why would you want to? Belt fed mounted guns would probably be a bit more efficient, giving you higher and more sustainable rate of fire, as well as leaving the hands free. If you're just looking for larger rounds, we already do that, from .50 caliber all the way up to the howitzers' 8" and beyond. Grenades could be unscaled pretty reasonably, but the bigger the boom the further away you want to be when it happens, so a launcher may make sense, but I suppose a large Mech could throw them by "hand". 

At the risk of getting my name on a list... I would go with a biological attack as well, but rather than sinking loads of time, effort, and money into developing a super virus, I would look into getting my hands on a wide variety viruses. Look into things like: H1N1 Any number Viral hemorrhagic fevers Multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis And so on... So rather than a single wide spread pandemic you have several overlapping pandemics. Dispersal would probably get a little expensive, you'd want to simultaneously strike as many major airports and seats of power as possible (by seats of power I mean parliaments, senates, military bases, and so on...) It would probably also be worthwhile to go after medical establishments (hospitals and large medical conferences). Keep in mind you're not dropping one virus per location you're looking to drop as many as possible on every location. Then if you have any doubts about how effective things are going to be or you really want to add to the heap... Taint basic medical supplies (latex gloves for instance). You don't really need to cause casualties with this. It just creates further panic and gives people a reason to fear and delay treatment. 

My best guess on why animals would develop asymmetrical body plans would have to be sexual selection. To be a little more clear... Most animals, even humans, favor symmetry when it comes to selecting sexual partners. Symmetry tends to be a sign of good reproductive health. Poor nutrition, disease, and/or traumatic injury are often the causes of asymmetry in many species. "Hey, baby, I see that you aren't missing any parts, and that your parts appear to be in the correct locations... " You get what I'm saying To make a species, or several species, asymmetrical all you really need is for that asymmetry to offer a slight advantage. Chances are pretty good that sexual selection will take that asymmetry and exaggerate it. The lop-sided claws you see in many species of crab are a good example of this tendency. Having one large claw for defeating rivals and one small claw for feeding offered a crab a slight practical advantage. Over generations the claw used to defeat rivals will grow larger because those with a larger claw are getting more chances to mate. If female crabs are also more attracted to fellas with one large claw, those with a larger claw will be doing even more mating. So... Bottom line if you want asymmetry just make it sexy... 

Over time the dragons who developed stronger more specialized flight wings would become more maneuverable in the air, thus increasing their chances of catching jumping crickets. As their hunting prowess increased they would have some spare food energy that they could use to grow a bit larger bringing more things on to the menu. Now dragons begin to look more like dragons, just smaller. Of course as the dragons become more proficient hunters, prey animals begin to develop counter measures. At this stage the going adaptations for avoiding dragon attacks would be: 

After giving this a bit more thought, I think a "Wrong Planet" would differ quite a bit from person to person... Here's a bit of what my world would be like in no particular order: 

In shallow water you could track the movements of the sun/moon/stars much like early farmers did. In deeper waters they may resort to looking at things like animal migration patterns to keep track of seasons. 

I'm by no means a military history buff, so take this with a grain of salt... I'm thinking that it would largely depend on range and given the blockade formation (several ships side by side) that this would probably be a longer range engagement to start off. Long range shots tend to be parabolic, aim high on your target and expect an arch in the shot. This may sound obvious, but determining distance tends to be more difficult than direction... More or less it's much easier to adjust left and right than it is to recalculate the distance (pitching the barrel up or down) With that out of the way... You'll present a smaller target approaching head on, from a left right perspective, but a slightly larger target on the other axis. See: $URL$ for the math. I think I get the source of the question... In earlier naval combat "broadsiding" was more of an issue. Canons were shorter range and shots tended to require less of an arc and you could place a lot more cannons down the length of a ship in fixed placement, but by the 1920-30's artillery had progressed enough to allow for much longer shots. These larger artillery pieces also tended to have larger calibers and longer barrels, so a forward facing placement was a bit more practical. Kind of the difference between a volley of fire approach and a more targeted approach. 

You probably noted that being poisonous was a strategy developed early on that kept certain species from being eaten, this will probably remain one of the most effective deterrents. 

Teach him to play guitar... Seriously, he doesn't even need to play particularly well, just enough to give a convincing stage performance. Hire a really talented band to back him up and do the studio recording. Pay off a few radio DJs and promoters and your problem is solved. In a few easy steps you've taken your boss from monster to rock star. People expect rock stars to be a little dark and eccentric. They put up with their excesses and expect wild behavior. Not to mention that your boss also gets a steady stream of juvenile delinquent groupies to feed on... "Angsty teenage rock fans run away from home all the time, nothing to worry about, I'm sure they'll turn up." And a constant touring lifestyle keeps the bodies from piling up in one place. If anyone gets too suspicious convince him to do a few public service announcements about the "growing problem of teen suicide, pregnancy, drug abuse, or whatever" just a little something to keep the moral outrage directed somewhere else. 

Your red line never stops, but your blue lines more or less behave like normal trains. The blue lines make regular stops at stations, load passengers and freight, then speed up to match the speed of the red line for several miles allowing for a "hard dock" procedure to take place between the two moving trains where passengers and freight are passed between the two trains. This sort of system could minimize some of the aforementioned safety concerns and would require substantially less energy. 

Schoolyard games like Bloody Knuckles also come to mind. I can remember playing several versions, but any game that requires the exchange of physical pain until one player yields may work. 

This may be a little too obvious, but what about a few demonstrations of inexplicable barroom physics... Being a "garage physicist" one could assume that Bob enjoys playing pool, because there's a good deal of physics involved in the game. Bob decides to invite Alice out for a few games and more than a few drinks. After they order the first round, Bob offers to pay, but the bartender refuses to take his money. Alice thinks that Bob set it up in advance, but isn't too concerned about the free drinks. They play their first game, Bob wins, but not through any extraordinary event, he just plays a little better than Alice. Bob begins to rack the balls and offers to let Alice break on the next game. Alice breaks and inexplicably every ball on the table bounces into a pocket. She immediately assumes that Bob has conspired with the generous bartender and rigged the table. He laughs and assures her that there is no grand conspiracy and offers to rack the balls again. Alice refuses to let him rack and starts to collect the balls. She takes her time examining each ball and allows them to roll across the table watching for any peculiarities. Bob offers to break, but Alice again refuses. Alice spots the cue ball and hits it hard, really hard, it flies across the table and bounces off the 1 ball with enough force to send it flying back into a corner pocket, but none of the other balls on the table move at all. At this point Alice is fuming, but Bob laughs it off, takes the cue ball in hand and citing the rules of the game places it behind the head string and hits it. The cue ball again flies across the table, but this time only the striped balls bounce into the pockets, leaving the solid balls completely untouched, still in formation. Alice groans, but being curious at this point, lines up and takes her shot. She hits the cue ball hard out of frustration, but the cue ball crawls across the table slowly. Bob shrugs his shoulders and goes off to get another round. Orders two pints and two shots and returns a good while before the cue ball finishes its trip across the table. When the cue ball finally strikes the 4 ball both of the balls move as if the cue ball had been traveling at a good clip. Alice drops the pool cue and looks at Bob, fed up, and ready to leave. Bob stops her before she can say anything "I'll tell you what. Flip a coin. If you win I'll leave you alone, you can go home and tell everyone that I rigged the table. But... If I win you have to take this shot and hear me out." Alice furrows her brow digs in her pocket, and produces a quarter. She pauses for a moment and flips it into the air. "Call It!" "Neither!" Sure enough the quarter, bounces onto the table rolls on its edge in a circle around the shot glasses and just stops. Still standing on its edge. Alice's eyes open wide, without saying anything she grabs a shot glass downs the whiskey and slams the glass upside down trapping the still standing quarter. Bob takes his shot slowly knocks it back and starts to explain... "So... I was messing around in the garage the other day..." 

A General Strike might work. If a large enough portion of the population simply refused to go to work it would cripple the economy and force the corrupt government to react. If the government reacts by mobilizing troops against the civilian population there's a reasonable chance that soldiers may have an ethical problem with using force against unarmed civilians in their own country. Soldiers may begin to go on strike as well. With the workforce and the military on strike the government effectively looses power. 

This may be on the obvious end, but axes and hammers have been used at great length and with reasonable success. There's not a whole lot of difference between a war hammer and a sledgehammer. Heavy thing on a stick will break bones as easily as it breaks rocks. Axes see a little more customization, but for the most part an axe is an axe. A sharp heavy thing on a stick is even better than a regular old heavy thing on a stick.
