This is an impossible question for the mapping sites to answer. They come up with heuristics about what makes a good route, that will do a pretty good job, but there is fine detail they do not and cannot know. For example, Your route 2 is the easiest on paper, but what if it poorly sealed with course chip and has lots of rubbish and stones in the shoulder. Route 1 has been recently sealed with smooth, fast hot top and has a wide clean shoulder. Route 1 would be better. What if route 2, getting onto the top of the ridge exposed you to a prevailing head wind that route 1 was sheltered from - in this case the best route changes daily (Where I live, hourly). Add to this, a good route is subjective - as already suggested by @bibz guys out for training rides have different definition of good to a commuter. As a MTBer, I have a different definition of good to a roadie, as I have much lower gearing I can climb steep hills roadies want to avoid, I careless about gravel roads, road works or poorly maintained roads than roadies. They tend to want to go faster (and further) then I do. I am a strong hill climber, and will take a hilly route over a flat route any day, there are many who hate hills and a much stronger than me on the flat. (TBH The vast majority who are stronger than me everywhere). In the end technology cannot make you decisions for you, all it can do is make suggestions based on the data it has. Ask around locals for better advise, but in the end you have to actually ride the routes to work out which is best for you. 

In my experience, better brakes have never increased my top speed, I would be happy with a fraction of your 10km/h increase, can you please tell us how it works for you? I once joined a group of strangers I met on a ride. They had $5K bikes, I assumed I would never be able to keep up on my beat up 1995 hack. How wrong was I. See, I spent $200 bucks on a 2 day training course and knew how to ride (well, at least a lot better than I did), they spend 5K on their bikes and didn't. That $200 was the best money I every spent. If you ride is reliable, unless you have the skills of a world class rider, get some training/coaching. 

Along with other great suggestions by @Blam for the actual commuting, you might want to start by doing some "warm up" rides before committing to commuting. You can choose a quite traffic time, nice weather (not too hot, not too cold) and not be under time pressure. Instead of out and back, work out a loop with bail out points to get you home early if its too far and too uncomfortable. I would aim for a loop distance of around 5km for a start (If its too easy you can do it twice), with a bail out point half way. The real difficulty here is what "out of shape 60" for one person is an impressive super human machine for another. (I know people look at me funny when say I am unfit, and only managed 5 minute/km running speed over a 10km run) As far as the hill, use a low gear and keep the legs spinning (this is good advise on the flat, slow cadence which is bad for efficiency and knees.). If needed, get off and push the bike up the hill, don't be a hero. Only other advise is build up slowly - if you are sore from the previous ride, do not do the commute - although a short gentle ride in a low gear will help and is good, the same distance that made you sore will make things worse. 

@Aaron has a great answer, but he missed probably the most significant point .. Almost always, take the line most traveled. Unless you are a track builder (I hope not, as I would hope someone building tracks would not need to ask this question), there will be a line that others have used, or you are on "wild" tracks...... If its dirt/sand/mud it will be obvious. Rarely there is actually a faster but less obvious line thorough the corner that the unwashed masses have not found. This is where some real fun and learning starts to happen - find it. Even if there is not a better line, searching for it will teach you why the line is where it is. Ride the line everyone else takes, follow some really good riders into the corner, get really good at riding this line as well as you can (within your limits of skill, time availability, boredom etc). Now, go back, and pick a new line, ride it, and see how you go. Feel the difference. Follow some good rider through, and see if you make ground against them. I once spent an hour on one corner with a coach- a never forgotten lesson, if you can, do the same - pay someone who is really good to show you. Get lessons - a few hundred dollars will speed you up more than a multi-thousand dollar bike, and unlike a bike - the lessons learned last a lifetime. Be aware that you own speed and fitness plays apart - a top level rider may carry enough speed to get around the top faster than going tight, but you may be better staying tight. A weak rider on a heavy bike may be better to maintain speed, where as a powerful rider on a super light bike can accelerate quicker, so may be able to loose a bit of speed for a tighter line. 

Wellgo also do cleats that some claim are Shimano compatible, but other's say can be hard to get out of some Shimano pedals. They come in 98A (common), 99A and also I have seen a TB51A (but its not in the catalogue). Crank Bros and Richey have cleats that look similar, no idea about compatibility. 

The problem going x1 from x2 is the chain line can end up being wrong. Its easier with an x3, you just use the middle position and can often get away with using the standard chain ring. With a 2x conversion you use spacers to get the chain ring into the correct position Refer Here, which usually required longer chain ring bolts than standard on a 2x. The M786 has a derailleur is less than ideal for going to 1x unless you plan to stick to an 11-36 cassette. Although many run it with 40 or 42 tooth cassettes, its max tooth size specification is 36 teeth. You can use third party adapters to increase its useful maximum tooth size at a cost. If you already need a new cassette and derailleur to go 1x, the extra cost of a shifter and chain means going 11 speed will give a much better system for only a little extra cost. 

You have more than enough time, so use it. Start at 25km, increase distance by 10% per week. This would mean just six months to 280km. Key thing is start slowly, don't over do it, because of your time frame, do less not more, if you take time off (more than a couple of weeks), drop back a bit. Plot a line on a calendar - from now at 25km to May next year at 280km, this is the easiest to sustained buildup. Plot another line, From November at 25km to May. Think to yourself this is the line you must no drop under. For most people, due to 'life' getting in the way of training the reality will be in between these lines. Better to do 3 rides a week than one big one. Every few weeks have an easy week where you do maybe 1/2 to 2/3 of you previous week. The biggest obstacles will be being short of time during the week, in which case maximise you training effort, but make sure you get at least one long ride a month in. Failing to get out over winter (depending where you live) can be a problem, indoor trainer, or cross training at gym and pool will get you though winter in good shape. Still try to get out on the bike if you can. 

Fork boots were used to keep dirt off the stanchions and help keep the wipers clean. Modern quality forks have wipers that clean better and last longer, and more abrasive resistant stanchions, so no need for a boot. Cheap forks don't put boots on because in today's market place, boots scream cheap fork Dirt always manages to get behind the boot no matter how well sealed it is, this has several detrimental effects. Any dirt trapped between the boot and stanchion stays there and increases rubbing. The boot transfers dirt back to a stanchion wiped clean by the wiper. To make matters much worse, and probably the reason they have fallen out of favor the most - the better the seal, needed to make them most effective, the harder it was to clean behind them. Few people could be bothered (or never even knew) to clean behind the boot. Given that, for a typical user, dirt trapped behind the boot is far worse than dirt a naked fork is exposed to. Additionally moisture can be trapped in the boot, increasing the risk of corrosion on the stanchion, defeating the purpose of having the boot. Boot may have an advantage in extremely muddy conditions provided they are well sealed and removed for cleaning regularly. However, the effort is probably not worth the reward. 

It entirely depends on where you ride, weather conditions and how long you are out for. Your tolerance for discomfort an risk comes into it. e.g. If you are one hour riding time from the nearest road and you bike breaks, you break an arm, or leg...... Bigger pack carries more stuff. You want to carry the smallest amount possible, but still have room for the food, water tools, first aid kit, kitchen sink and warm cloths you need (not want). Note that if you have bag bigger than needed you will fill it with stuff you don't need. A smaller backpack is better, provided everything fits in. It sits better on your back and is less obtrusive, moving around less and usually more comfortable. therefore get the smallest that will carry the stuff you need. 

I'll answer you comment on contacts, as I think you should investigate it. I had the same dilemma a year ago. After wearing glasses for a couple of years for close up stuff, I was getting to the point I needed glasses while out on the trail. I looked around at options and decided to go down the contacts path. I now wear contacts in weekends and while riding, and have progressive lens glasses for work (computer based) that are suitable (although not ideal) for driving and distance. The glasses offer much better performance when its not raining, muddy etc, but when outdoors (biking, fishing, skiing etc) in all weather, contacts win hands down. I suggest you discuss contacts this with your optician. There are a vast range out there, from one time use that you take out an throw away to monthly lens than can be left in for a week. Your optician will discuss the in and outs of different types and what suits you, and try various combinations till you get one that works. He will teach you to put them in and take them out - all the stuff that is "creepy" is dealt with - You get shown how to do it properly (and safely), and will be taught how to do it. Although not for everyone, I found it easy to learn to do. I know you said cost is not an issue - that is good. Contacts are not cheap - initial fitting costs (where they also teach you how to look after your eyes and the lenses) - and cost of the contacts and cleaners mean glasses work out much cheaper. You may also want to discuss lazer surgery with your optician. 

Its impossible to answer this for you. The LBS who fixed the wheel is in the best position to give the advise you seek. My motto here would be 'If in doubt, throw it out'. If it was the rear wheel my answer might be different, but front wheel failure tend to be more catastrophic and most often occurs when you load the front wheel - think what happens if you tacho the wheel under heavy downhill braking - is it worth the risk? Additionally if there are loose spokes from straightening the rim, you are probably over loading other spokes. This along with increase rim flexing will almost certainly start to see spoke failure at some future time. How long the spokes will last and any ones guess. If me, I would get a price from the LBS for new rim or wheel. I might look for a used rim or wheel (e.g. asking around my local cycling club, Craigs list etc), riding the one I have till I found something in my price/quality/value range.
