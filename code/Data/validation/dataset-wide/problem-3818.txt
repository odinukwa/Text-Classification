If I am not mistaken there is a theorem that says any curve $C$ can be embedded in $\mathbf{P}^3$. What can be said about surfaces? Do we have a theorem like: 

The universal enveloping algebra of a Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ is isomorphic to the algebra of distributions on the Lie group $G$ with support at the identity. The proof I have of this fact uses the universal property of the universal enveloping algebra and hence it is not constructive. I was wondering if there is an explicit map? For example what would happen for $\mathfrak{g} = \mathfrak{sl}(2, \mathbf{C})$ and $G = SL(2, \mathbf{C})$? For an explicit monomial in $\mathscr{U} \ \left ( \mathfrak{sl}(2, \mathbf{C}) \right )$ can we write the corresponding distribution and how it acts on functions on $SL(2, \mathbf{C})$? 

There are some complications in the p-adic case. For GL_n, every maximal compact subgroup is conjugate to GL_n of the ring of integers, but for more general groups (eg PGL_2, SU_3) there can be more than one conjugacy class of maximal compact subgroups. One thing that you can say is that every maximal compact subgroup is the stabaliser of a point on the Bruhat-Tits building. 

I assume all groups are discrete and ignore Q3. Also I assume that π comes from a group homomorphism from H to G. By Poincaire-Verdier duality π! is the same as π*. Both of these are identified with restriction. Then π* is the right adjoint of restriction, hence is what I would call coinduction, while π! is the left adjoint of restriction, hence induction. In some contexts (e.g. p-adic groups), I've seen the right adjoint be called induction. The dualising sheaf is the same as the constant sheaf, hence corresponds to the trivial representation. 

A GCM is square matrix $A = (a_{ij})$ satisfying: (1) $a_{ij} \in \mathbf{Z}$ (2) $a_{ii} = 2$ for all $i$. (3) $a_{ij} \leq 0$ for $i \neq j$. (4) $a_{ij} = 0$ iff $a_{ji} = 0$. There is a standard notion of irreducibility among GCMs and the common term for it is "indecomposable". Now if you look at most books there is a standard basic classification of GCMs: An indecomposable GCM is of 3 kinds: finite, affine and another category which can be described as all-other-GCMs-that-I-know-little-about-so-I-will-bundle-them-together. There is also another classification based on whether the GCM is "symmetrizable" or not (the finite and affine GCMs are symmetric and hence symmetrizable). What I am looking for is a smart classification of the GCMs that are not finite or affine. For example here is a number of questions: 

I'm thinking of this as an "intersection," or "refinement" of the two complexes, maybe a "core" that has the most properties of both. I could take the trivial simplicial complex on the smaller number of vertices of the two, but this misses larger simplices. Better, I could take the largest simplicial complex $A$ smaller than both $S$ and $T$ for which there are injective simplicial maps $A\to S$ and $A\to T$, sort of as here. But this is not unique: 

$A$ and $B$ can't be compared by set inclusion. I can't think of any "good" construction of such an intersection, I can't capture all the similarities. For example, there is a simplicial map $A\to B$ that is injective on 1-simplices, but no such map $B\to A$, so $A$ could be considered "smaller" than $B$. But this seems roundabout. I'd be glad for any insight into why such a construction can / cannot work. Maybe I should look in a different category or use a different construction? Move to homology? My larger goal is to build a constructible sheaf valued in simplicial complexes. I know what its value should be at every stalk (some simplicial complex), but I'm not sure how I should be defining the sheaf on larger open sets that intersect several strata. 

EDIT: corrected a mathematical mistake pointed out by Jim Humphreys, also improved the format as to make things more visible. Again suggested by Jim Humphreys. 

For $SL(2, \mathbf{C} ((t)))$ the affine Grassmanian is defined as: $$SL(2, \mathbf{C}((t))) / SL(2, \mathbf{C} [[t]])$$ Now that is fine but $SL(2, \mathbf{C} ((t)))$ has smaller parabolic subgroups. Define: $$B = \begin{pmatrix} \mathcal{O}^{\times} & \mathcal{O} \\\ t\mathcal{O} & \mathcal{O}^{\times} \end{pmatrix}$$ where $\mathcal{O} = \mathbf{C}[[t]]$. Then: $$ SL(2, \mathbf{C} [[t]]) = B \left \{ 1, \begin{pmatrix} & 1 \\\ -1 & \end{pmatrix} \right \} B $$ Question: Why are people so much interested in the affine Grassmanian when it actually sits in a larger, equally well behaved projective ind-scheme (in our example above $SL(2, \mathbf{C}((t)))/ B$)? Both are flag varieties for the loop group so it seems natural to go with the full flag variety. 

Certainly for any choice of convex ordering you can pick out a basis of your simple Lie algebra. You do this by specialising the construction of PBW bases for quantum groups to q=1. (This construction can be presented without knowing about quantum groups). With your proposed formula for $E_{\alpha+\beta}$ as a commutator, I would encourage you to modify it by dividing by $p_{\alpha,\beta}+1$ where $p_{\alpha,\beta}$ is the largest integer $p$ such that $\beta-p\alpha$ is a root. This way you will get the correct integral form of the Lie algebra. See e.g. these notes of Bill Casselman. I don't know if the formula $E_{\alpha+\beta}=[E_\alpha,E_\beta]/(p_{\alpha,\beta}+1)$ holds for all $\alpha$ and $\beta$. Certainly it holds up to sign. If you make a further assumption that $(\alpha,\beta)$ is what I call a minimal pair, then this formula is correct, even in the quantum case, see Theorem 4.2 of arXiv:1210.6900. 

Recently I was watching a talk: $URL$ and at the end the lecturer gave a correspondence (I was having trouble with subscripts so changed the notation a bit): $$ \mathfrak{Q} (\lambda, \mu) \Leftrightarrow \mathfrak{M} (\lambda, \mu)$$ Between Quiver varieties and slices of affine Grassmannian. I would like to learn how this exactly works (like precise definition of both objects is a start!). If you have the time and the patience you can post a lengthy response here or you could just point me towards the right place to start reading on my own. Thank you! 

And if not what is the simplest counterexample? A counterexample would be an infinite sequence of surfaces: $\{S_1, S_2, \cdots \}$ and infinite sequence of strictly increasing positive integers: $\{n_1, n_2, \cdots \}$ such that $S_i$ can not be embedded in $\mathbf{P}^{n_i}$. 

You can take the real line as $(-\infty,x) \cup (x,\infty)$ stratified higher than $\{x\}$, for every real number $x$. But these certainly are all homeomorphic. Judging by this question and the Whitney embedding theorem, there are uncountably many different 2-dimensional strata of $\mathbf R^4$ (as there are uncountably many non-compact surfaces). With the weaker notion of "poset stratification" as in Lurie Appendix A.5, you can also do some finagling with the power set of a countably infinite poset (the strata can still be topological spaces, but their dimensions may not correspond to their stratum order). 

I am trying to calculate the Chern class of the tangent bundle of the sphere $S^6$. I am told that this is an interesting case, since $S^6$ is not a complex manifold, but it has an almost complex structure on it, induced by the octonions (and I would like to learn more abut complex structures and the octonions). The Chern class of $S^2$ can be found by using its complex structure, but that can't be extended to $S^6$. Apparently, one way of solving this is viewing $S^6$ in $\mathbb R^7$, then $\mathbb R^7$ as the "imaginary" part of the octonions, and the octonions as $\mathbb R^8$. With such a decomposition we could write $T\mathbb R^8|_{S^6}=TS^6\oplus L$ for $L$ a line bundle (the "real" part of the octonions), but I'm not sure how that works out. So my question is how I would find the Chern class through this complex structure approach. 

I will give the following positive answer: Let H be a split reductive subgroup of the split reductive group G of the same rank. Let WH and WG be their Weyl groups. Then every fundamental invariant of WH divides a fundamental invariant of WG. Unsatisfactionally, this proof will not give a bijection between fundamental invariants satisfying a divisibility condition. This includes all the usual examples of Levi subgroups of reductive groups, as well as some funkier examples such as Spin(9)⊂F4. Let PG(t) be the Poincaire polynomial $$P_G(t)=\sum_{w\in W_G} t^{\ell(w)}$$ and similarly for PH(t). Since H(q) is a subgroup of G(q), Lagrange's theorem, together with the formula for the order of a reductive group over a finite field, gives us the divisibility relation $$P_H(q)\mid q^NP_G(q)$$ for some positive integer N. (I've already cancelled the common factor of (q-1)r since G and H both have rank r). And as PH has constant term 1, we can strengthen this to PH(q) dividing PG(q). Once we have this divisibility relation for infinitely many q, this implies that PH(t) divides PG(t) in ℤ[t]. This may not be immediately obvious so here is the proof: Since PH is monic, you can use the division algorithm to write PG=qPH+r with the degree of r less than the degree of PH. For infinitely many prime powers q, |r(q)|<|PH(q)|. Thus the divisibility relation implies that for such q, r(q)=0. r now has infinitely many roots, so is the zero polynomial. Now let d be a fundamental invariant of WH and let ζ be a primitive d-th root of 1.Then PH(ζ)=0. The divisibility result we've just established implies that PG(ζ)=0 as well. Since PG(t) divides the product of te-1 as e runs over all fundamental invariants of WG, it must be that d divides one of these fundamental invariants. QED.
