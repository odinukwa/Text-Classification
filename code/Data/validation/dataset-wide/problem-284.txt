Use some of the electricity generated by the electric turbines to heat up the most important parts to keep them ice free so the turbines can turn. And waste heat rising from a multi story single building city could warm up wind turbines on top of the city. And if the wind turbines are designed to use rising currents of air, the air warmed up by waste heat from the city will provide a steady wind for them to use. 

$URL$ Calcium carbonate contains calcium, carbon, and oxygen. Portland cement is made by heating limestone (calcium carbonate) with other materials. On a lifeless planet with no limestone calcium carbonate and the other materials can be obtained by heating up rocks to melting or vaporizing temperatures and centrifuging the liquid or vapor to separate the elements and storing the elements separately until they are needed. Compounds may be synthesized by machines like 3-D printers that form chemical compounds element by element, perhaps. They would take elements from their storage bins as needed. Melting or vaporizing mountains of rock to reduce to elements would take immense amounts of energy. But the space colony will probably have fusion reactors to supply almost unlimited energy, and/or gigantic flimsy space mirrors to focus vast amounts of sunlight on small areas to generate energy. Thus if a lot of concrete for construction is needed on a lifeless planet the cement will be chemically synthesized. 

Air superiority is a thing because of logistics, not because a plane can beat it's cost in ground forces If I have 100 planes, then every potential target in your country needs to be able to defend itself against 100 planes because I can strike any of them. Since your country probably has thousands of targets I might strike, you do not have the option of putting ground forces everywhere. Your only option is to get your own planes, which is also your best option for attacking me. Aircraft don't have a massive advantage in battle simply because they are high up. If they could land and fight on the ground, as your angels can, they would not lose the real advantage of air superiority. If the angels are flying high, the demons can plausibly dodge the crap that gets dropped on them. If the angels fly low, the demons will throw stuff back and the angels may be significantly worse off than if they landed, folded their wings and assumed some sort of battle formation. 

In ancient times there were probably tens or hundreds of thousands of separate tribes and other groups on Earth. The Roman Empire conquered hundreds or possibly thousands of realms, some of them large nations but most tiny city states or tribes. And there were hundreds of other tribes in northern and eastern Europe beyond the Roman Empire that gradually consolidated into modern European nations over centuries. In medieval Ireland there where about 90 or 150 kingdoms, each having a small area and a small population, for example. 

80,000 to 96,000 time the brightness of the full moon would be about 20,000 to 24,000 lux, equal to: 

$URL$ If you consider it desirable for the farther star to be more than 0.25 times as bright on the planet's surface as the nearer star that the planet orbits, or if you want the star that the planet orbits to be as bright as the sun, then the other star will have to be too luminous to be old enough for its planets to be habitable for humans or have higher life forms. And since the two stars and all their planet should be the same age, the planet in question and the star that it orbits will also have to be too young for the planet to be interesting. Unless scientists note that the planet should not yet be habitable or have advanced lifeforms. Thus characters may speculate that advanced aliens terraformed the planet, or that the entire planet was moved from an older solar system into this younger solar system by super advanced aliens. And maybe someone will point out that the clock is ticking and there are "only" a few million years left until the brighter star swells into a red giant and all life in the system is destroyed. .............................................................. My Previous Answer. For scientific reasons I have reversed your star designations, making Star B the one that Planet X orbits and Star A the more distant star. If planet X orbits Star B but not Star A, Star A should be at least ten times as far away from Planet X as Star B is, in order for the orbit of planet X to be stable. If this is supposed to be hard science fiction you will need a more expert opinion. Of course the distance between Star A and Star B can be many times the minimum of ten times the radius of Planet X's orbit around Star B. If the distance between Star A and Star B is exactly 10 times the radius of Planet X's orbit around Star B, then some times Planet X will be exactly 11 times as far from Star A as from Star B. And sometimes Planet X will be only 9 times as far from star A as from Star B. The distance from Star A to Planet X will vary between 0.9 and 1.1 times the average distance. And since the amount of light planet X receives from star A varies with the square of the distance, that amount will vary from 0.826 to 1.234 of the average amount. If the distance between Star A and Star B is exactly 100 times the radius of Planet X's orbit around Star B, the amount of light that Planet X receives from Star A will vary between 0.980 and 1.019 of the average amount of light. Since that is a smaller range of difference, as a general rule you would want the distances between Star A and Star B to be as many times greater as possible than the radius of the orbit of Planet X around star B. But you also need the distance between Star A and Star B to be as small as possible compared to the radius of the orbit of Planet X around Star B. If you want Planet X to be interesting because it is habitable for Earth Humans, or has advanced multi celled life like trees and mammals, or has native intelligent beings. If Star A is 10 times as far away from Planet X as Star B is, which I think is the minimum distance for Planet X to have a stable orbit, it will have to be 100 times as luminous as Star B to give Planet X as much light as Star B does. If Star A is only as luminous as Star B it will give Planet X only one percent of the light that Star B gives planet X. If Star A is 100 times as far away from Planet X as Star B is, it will have to be 10,000 times as luminous as Star B to give Planet X as much light as Star B does. If Star A is only as luminous as Star B it will give Planet X only one hundredth of one percent (or 0.0001) of the light that Star B gives planet X. You didn't specify the desired ratio between the apparent brightness of Star A and Star B as seen from Planet X. You just said Star A (your Star B) should give Planet X enough light to make a difference. And you didn't specify whether you meant enough light to make a difference in the temperature of Planet X or merely enough light to make a difference in it's illumination. If you want Star A to shed as much light on Planet X as Star B does, then the ratio of their relative absolute luminosity must equal the square of the ratio of their relative distances from Planet X. If Star A is 10 times as distant as Star B it will have to be 100 times as luminous to appear exactly as bright in the sky of Planet X. If Star A is 100 times as distant as Star B it will have to be 10,000 times as luminous to appear exactly as bright in the sky of Planet X. If Star A is 1,000 times as distant as Star B it will have to be 1,000,000 times as luminous to appear exactly as bright in the sky of Planet X. Thus if Star A and Star B have to have anything remotely resembling the same brightness in the sky of planet X, Star A should have at least several times the absolute luminosity of Star B, and possibly up to millions of times the luminosity. Thus Star A would be much intrinsically brighter than Star B. Thus Astronomers would call it A and call the star that Planet X orbits B. Because of the high probability that the more distant star would be more luminous than the star Planet X orbits, I switched the designations of the stars from what they were in your question. Suppose that you desire star A to appear 0.0001 times as bright in the sky of Planet X as Star B. Then if Star A is 0.10 times as luminous as Star B, and 10 times as far from Planet X, it will appear to be 0.0001 times as bright from the surface of Planet X. If Star A is exactly as luminous as Star B, and 100 times as far from Planet X, it will appear to be 0.0001 times as bright from the surface of Planet X. If Star A is 1,000 times as luminous as Star B, and 1,000 times as far from Planet X, it will appear to be 0.0001 times as bright from the surface of Planet X. If Star A is 10,000 times as luminous as Star B, and 10,000 times as far from Planet X, it will appear to be 0.0001 times as bright from the surface of Planet X. Thus even if Star A appears only 0.0001 times as bright as Star B as seen from Planet X, it could, depending on its distance, be tens, hundreds, or even many thousands of times as absolutely luminous as Star B, the star that Planet X orbits. By comparison, the Sun has an apparent brightness as seen from Earth 398,110 times as bright as the apparent brightness of an average full moon. The apparent brightness of the full moon is 0.0000025 that of the Sun, so if Star B appears as Bright as the Sun from Planet X and Star A appears only 0.0001 as bright as star B as seen from Planet X that could still be about 40 times as bright as a full moon seen from Earth. The absolutely most luminous star known to science is R136a1 in the Large Magellanic Cloud, about 8,710,000 times as luminous as the Sun. The least luminous known star is 2MASS J0523-1403, about 0.000126 times as luminous as the Sun. That gives a luminosity range of about 69,126,983,000 times. That should be enough for any desired difference in the luminosity of the two stars in the solar system of Planet X, right? Wrong. If you want Planet X to be interesting because it is habitable for Earth Humans, or has advanced multi celled life like trees and mammals, or has native intelligent beings, Planet X must have enjoyed a relatively constant amount of radiation from it's sun, Star B, for billions of years, since Earth is believed to be relatively typical, and it took billions of years for those things to develop on Earth. Therefore Star B that Planet X orbits must have been a relatively stable main sequence star for billions of years in order for Planet X to be habitable for Earth Humans, or have advanced multi celled life like trees and mammals, or have native intelligent beings. And since both stars in the system would be the same age, Star A must also have been a relatively stable main sequence star for billions of years. When stars eventually leave the main sequence they usually change in ways that destroys all life on the planets that orbit them and may also destroy all life on planets orbiting other stars in the same star system. And what types of stars will remain stable main sequence stars for billions of years? Stars of late spectral type F (starting at maybe type F8), type G, Type K, and type M. Thus Star B, that Planet X orbits, and Star A, in the same star system, would both have to be somewhere between about spectral type F8V to M9V, which would limit the possible range of their luminosity difference. I believe the extreme possible luminosity difference between Star A and Star B would be about 25 times. But many scientists believe that stars from mid type K and all type M stars are not suitable for having habitable planets for various reasons. If that is correct the possible spectral types for Star B would be limited to about F8V to K5V. That gives a luminosity range of about six times for the difference between Star A and Star B. But since it is not specified whether Star A should have any habitable planets its spectral type can be between type F8V and type M9V. So if you want your story to be anything like hard science fiction you should find more precise figures for the various limits listed before making your calculations, if you want Planet X to be interesting because it is habitable for Earth Humans, or has advanced multi celled life like trees and mammals, or has native intelligent beings. Unless the stars in the star system are younger and should not have planets as advanced as Planet X seems to be. Perhaps super powerful aliens terraformed Planet X millions of years ago and seeded it with life forms billions of years more advanced than it had time to evolve naturally, or even took Planet X from its original star system and moved it into the much younger star system it is now in. 

Commonly useful magic is free, it's the custom jobs that cost money. Much like real world software, magic that everyone would find useful is available for free because sooner or later someone will do it pro bono. As for operating systems, so for Cure Light Wounds. But if you are a businessman, and you need something done that is rather specific and/or unusual, the magic script you need may not exist. So you contact the magic shop, explain your needs, pay for it, then they do the work and email you the magic script you need. In this case, the magic is inherently safe from piracy because only the paying customer wants it. 

With computers, the date will never be too long. So what if the year is 654,546,534,120,296,145? A computer can easily store and communicate numbers like that. And that far into the future, we could have computers implanted in our brains so we can do complicated arithmetic in our heads, remember everything and communicate as quickly as a wireless data transfer. Whatever problems exist in that year won't include the size of the number. 

Did you ever hear of the Endor Holocaust? You can find sites on the internet that argue for and against the Endor Holocaust, the theory that the Endor moon would have been devastated by the explosion of the second Death Star. $URL$ And what about the Yavin IV holcaust? What happened to the habitable and partly jungle covered fourth moon of Yavin when the expanding cloud of gas that resulted from the explosion of the first Death Star struck Yavin IV? Could any life survive on Yavin IV? Did the rebels have to rapidly evacuate Yavin IV before the shock wave from the Death Star struck the moon? And what about the deadly radiation emitted by the explosions? Would everyone and all life forms on the near sides of Endor's Moon and Yavin IV receive fatal does of radiation or perhaps even be instantly vaporized even at distances of thousands or millions of miles? The only way to know is to have someone do the calculations and see. In the meantime I would guess that it might not be safe for Earth and Earth life to blow up even distant Pluto. So maybe the explosion loving alien should take his super bomb into interstellar space and explode the planet buster in empty space. Thus he can see a very, very, very, very, very big explosion. If the explosion loving alien needs to see a huge object be destroyed, maybe he can go the Oort Cloud in our solar system (his fellow aliens would prefer he does it in our solar system instead of theirs). The Oort cloud can be considered to both be in interstellar space and in the outer reaches of our solar system. The Oort cloud is believed to consist of an inner torus shaped cloud of comets stretching from 2,000 to 20,000 Astronomical Units (AU) from the Sun and an outer spherical cloud that stretches from about 20,000 AU (0.32 light year) to about 50,000 AU (0.79 light year) or possibly several times that distance from the Sun. It is believed that the billions and trillions of comets in the outer Oort cloud may have a total mass of about 5 earth masses. It is believed that the inner Oort cloud contains tens or hundreds of times as many comets as the outer Oort cloud. So the bang loving alien can spend centuries, or millions of years, or however long it takes, to change the orbits of trillions of comets in the Oort could and assemble them into a planet large enough to satisfy his lust for explosions and then blast it with his planet busting bomb. And maybe that will be far enough from Earth that the radiation does not kill any Earth life. And maybe that will be far enough from Earth that the expanding sphere of gases will not destroy all life on Earth. And maybe that will be far enough from Earth that the expanding sphere of debris will not be thick enough when it reaches Earth to cause any extinction level impacts. Or maybe the alien will build not one planet but two planets that orbit each other. And when the planets are lined up with the inner solar system he will explode the planet that is farther away from the Sun. And the planet closer to the Sun might shield the solar system, absorbing radiation and shock waves and debris and creating a safe shadow that covers the planets of the solar system. Or maybe the alien will plant his bomb in the Sun, at one of the poles pointing perpendicular to the plane the planets orbit in. And his giant explosion might blast away a chunk of the sun the size of a planet and send it on its way out into interstellar space. But the planet sized chunk of material ejected from the Sun will be only a tiny insignificant fraction of the Sun's mass and the Sun will continue basically unchanged - we hope. It is certainly possible to create a very, very, very, big explosion on the Sun that would be very spectacular at close range (but far enough away to be safe, of course) but not be noticed at the distance of Earth. In any case the only safe solar system planet to blow up might have to be an artificial planet as far out in the Oort could as possible. 

Because it is full of air It is like trying to submerge a balloon, and the thrusters just aren't powerful enough. A long haul spacecraft needs to provide food and water and deal with waste, and this problem is solved by onboard farms, where plants and fungi absorb the waste, make food, make oxygen, and generally keep everyone alive. This requires a large volume of air. At the same time, the craft will be designed to be as light as possible, so the hull of the craft might not be very heavy. The end result is that it's overall density is 1/5 of water, so it's engines would need 4x it's weight in thrust to go underwater. But 4G is rather unpleasant and won't make you much faster due to fuel/reaction mass constraints, so the thrusters simply aren't that powerful. Edit: Since ArtisticPhoenix mentioned fuel, I thought I would look up the density of that. Liquid oxygen is slightly denser than water, at 1.141 kg/L, but liquid hydrogen is very light, at 0.071 kg/L. In the correct proportions, that's an overall density of 0.427. Now a spacecraft should be able to push itself underwater with that sort of density, but it is clearly not the right vehicle for the job. 

Try smashing the planet with a moon very tiny compared to the Earth's moon but larger than the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs. I know that's not what you want but your victims will be just as dead. Suppose that your target planet has a very small moon orbiting at a great though realistic distance. Suppose that the people of the target planet don't have many facilities on that small moon or consider it worth defending. Possibly they have a lot of important facilities on closer moons and orbital space stations a lot closer to their planet. And they might have super force fields around their entire planet and those close orbital facilities to defend against any attack. And giant orbital ray guns to blast any space ship that comes close to the planet and its orbital facilities. So the attacking space navy comes and blasts at the planetary defense shields at a safe range and the planetary defense ray guns keep them covered, firing whenever they get too close. And many ships duck behind the outer moon and pop out from behind to fire at the planet and then duck back into cover. And the planetary defenders think that's all they're doing. But some of the space ships are unloading parts for a giant space drive, a giant rocket or anti gravity engine or whatever. It took them months or years to design and build an engine so much bigger than any built before. And using tractor beams they are assembling it on the back side of the moon but pointed forward so that its trust will slow down the orbital speed of the moon. So they turn on the giant engine and it quickly slows the moon's orbit so that it soon has no speed relative to the planet and falls toward the planet under the gravity of the planet. It will take just a few days to smash into the planet, just as Apollo space craft took about three Earth days to "fall" from Lunar orbit to low Earth orbit. The defenders try blasting it with their giant space ray guns, but they can't vaporize away enough of the moon's mass in a few days. It will still have enough mass and velocity to cause an extinction level impact. They can't build a giant space engine to take to the moon and change its velocity and trajectory in the time they have left. They send ships with giant atomic bombs to try to reduce the mass and/or change the velocity of the falling moon, but those are all blasted by the attacking space armada once they pass outside the defense force fields. They're doomed. 

One useful alternative to lighter than air gases would be to act as a solar balloon: $URL$ A Solar balloon is black and absorbs sunlight, so the air inside it gets hot, so it becomes a hot air balloon that doesn't need a burner. The downside is that it only works during the day. You also get a lot less lift than hydrogen would give you, but without the technical problems that hydrogen would give you, like escaping and being difficult to replace. 

Plants already produce food from basic raw materials at low cost, and they themselves can reproduce. They make a great variety of foodstuffs and many people eat only plants. Yet there is still hunger. I don't think a 3D printer would change much. 

Most of the Royal Navy gets destroyed by a massive storm. This famously happened to not one but two Mongol invasion fleets sent to invade Japan. The Romans also managed to lose their fleets to storms several times. It was less likely to happen to the Royal Navy due to the fact that they had radios and weather forecasts, but they didn't have satellites or computers so it is still plausible that they could be blindsided by a storm. A storm could also hit the UK itself and destroy planes and infrastructure, gifting an easy victory to Hitler, should he be ready to seize the opportunity. Of course Hitler would still need a lot of ships, but he might be able to scrounge together civilian vessels and Japanese/Italian vessels to make it happen. 

$URL$ Since this was centuries before the earliest known examples of Germanic child monarchs, I don't know if Battarius inherited his leadership or earned it somehow. in the US Civil War, many thousands of men were commissioned as officers in the various armies and navies. And most of them were men almost old enough to be the fathers of the typical soldiers, who were mostly young men in their twenties. But a few of the officers were very old, and a few of them were very young, but somehow managed to command positions. Most Union soldiers in the Civil war were members of jointly controlled federal/state volunteer units. Volunteers would be organized into companies and regiments by states and territories. They would be mustered into federal service and then paid and supplied by the Federal government. The men would often elect their officers who would be commissioned by the state or territorial governments. The federal government only commissioned general officers or officers in the rarer federal units. The Provisional Army of the Confederate States of America was formed in a similar way. Because the majority of the Civil War units were such volunteer units, most of the officers, especially at first, commanded because their subordinates had agreed to obey them, often by elections. At the beginning of the war the officers and non commissioned officers were usually not imposed on the privates by outside authorities, but chosen by the privates from among their friends and members of their communities. During the Civil War, most companies had only one first sergeant, six sergeants, and four corporals in their tables of organization, and most or all of them had command duties. Thus it was much more impressive to be promoted to those ranks, especially corporal, than it is at the present time. For example, Thomas P. Gere (December 10, 1842-January 8, 1912) was a lieutenant when he earned the Medal of Honor at the Battle of Nashville on December 16, 1864, aged 22 years and 6 days. That's doing pretty good as a young officer, right? Actually Gere enlisted in the Fifth Minnesota Volunteer Infantry, and was mustered in January 17, 1862, and was promoted to first sergeant and then second lieutenant. His company was stationed at Fort Ridgely, Minnesota, when the Minnesota Sioux uprising started on August 18, 1862, and Captain Marsh and many of the men were killed trying to rescue civilians. This left Lieutenant Gere in command, age 19 years, 8 months, and 8 days. Lt. Timothy Sheehan (age 21) arrived with reinforcements before the Sioux attacked on August 20 and 22. Lieutenant General Arthur MacArthur Jr. (June 2, 1845-September 5, 1912) enlisted in the 24th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry and was commissioned a first lieutenant and adjutant August 4, 1862, aged 17 years, 2 months and 2 days. At the Battle of Missionary Ridge, November 25, 1863, thousands of Union soldiers ran up the ridge without orders to drive away the entrenched Rebels at the top. Lt. MacArthur was one of the leaders in that attack, carrying the regimental colors and planting them at the top of the ridge, age 18 years, 5 months, and 23 days, and was awarded the medal of honor. He was promoted to major January 25, 1864 aged 18 years, 7 months, and 23 days, and to lieutenant colonel May 18, 1865, aged 19 years, 11 months, and 16 days. MacArthur was thus called "the boy colonel". Henry King Burgwyn, Jr. (October 2, 1841-July 1, 1863) also became known as "the boy colonel" (of the Confederacy). He was commissioned lieutenant colonel of the 26th North Carolina in August, 1861, aged 19 years and 10 months, and colonel in August 1862 when still 20. Uriah Galusha Pennypacker enlisted in the Union Army in 1861 and rose from private to quartermaster sergeant. He recruited a company for the 97 Pennsylvania volunteers and was commissioned captain in August 1861, and Major in October. He was commissioned colonel August 15, 1864, and led a brigade. He was promoted to brigadier general, United States Volunteers, April 28, 1865, and after the war he became a colonel in the regular army in July 1866. Various sources said that Pennypacker was born June 1, 1844, making him a Major aged 17 years and 4 months, a colonel aged 20 years and 4 months, a brigadier general aged 20 years and 10 months, and a regular army colonel aged 22 years and 1 month. Other sources say he was born on June 1, 1842, thus making him two years older when he achieved those ranks. Charles Cleveland Dodge (September 16, 1841-November 4, 1910) was commissioned a captain in the 7th New York Volunteer Cavalry in December, 1861, aged 20 years and two months. He was promoted colonel August 14, 1862 aged 20 years, 10 months, and 19 days, and brigadier general USV November 29, 1862, aged 21 years, 2 months, and 13 days. He resigned in June 1863 but led militia against draft rioters in New York City the next month. Ulrich Dahlgren (April 3, 1842-March 2,1864) was commissioned a captain on May 29, 1862 aged 20 years, 1 month, and 26 days, and a colonel July 24, 1863, aged 21 years, 3 months, and 21 days. Many accounts of young Rebels claim that T.G. Bean recruited and trained two companies of recruits in 1861 aged 13 before joining the Rebel army 2 years later. But he was actually Thomas Greene Bush, born 19 august 1947, and he was about 16 years and 11 months old when becoming lieutenant and adjutant of the 62nd Alabama regiment in 1863, and 17 years, 8 months, and 15 days old when they surrendered on May 4, 1865. W. D. Peake (born December 22, 1846) enlisted in Company A, 26 Tennessee Infantry (rebel) and was promoted to sergeant sometime before the war ended in April and May 1865 when he was 18 years and 5 or 6 months old. Henry Weidensaul was probably born July 1, 1847 and enlisted in the 46th Pennsylvania Infantry in 1861. He was promoted to Corporal May 18, 1863 aged 15 years, 10 months, and 17 days, to sergeant October 1, 1864, aged 17 years, and 3 months, and to first sergeant on July 1, 1865 aged 18 years. There is a possibility that a James H. Deal became a Rebel lieutenant aged about 13 to 18 but there is no proof of his service. There is a story that a T.D. Claiborne was born in 1747 and became a captain in the 18th Virginia Infantry in 1861, a Major and a lieutenant colonel in 1863, and died in 1864. However, there also a statement that Captain T.D. Claiborne of the 11th Viginia was born December 25, 1835. John C. Delany was born April 22, 1848, and enlisted March 5, 1862, in the 107th Pennsylvania Volunteers and apparently promoted to corporal aged fourteen years, eight months, and thirteen days, sergeant sixteen years, five months, and twenty four days, first sergeant sixteen years, eleven months, and seven days, and second lieutenant aged seventeen years, one month and five days, and earned the Medal of Honor aged sixteen years, nine months, and fifteen days. Gustave Albert Schurmann was born February 4, 1849 and enlisted in the 40th New York Volunteers in 1861. He was apparently promoted to sergeant in 1863 around the time of his 14th birthday. An E.G. Baxter allegedly enlisted in the 7th Kentucky cavalry (Rebel) aged about 12 and was commissioned an 2nd lieutenant when aged 13, but I have not found any record of that officer. Musician Charles Edwin King was probably born on April 3, 1849, enlisted in the 49th Pennsylvania Volunteers September 12, 1861 aged 12 year, 5 months, and 9 days, and died of wounds on September 20, 1862, aged 13 years, 5 months, and 17 days. It has been claimed that he was promoted to drum major during his service. John Lincoln Clem (August 13, 1851-May 13, 1937) of the 22nd Michigan became one of the most famous drummer boys in the Civil War. He was promoted to the little known rank of lance sergeant on September 20, 1863. Thus he became a non commissioned officer aged 12 years, 1 month, and 7 days. A Charles Carter Hay claimed to have joined the 15th Alabama age 11 and to have been appointed a lieutenant and a captain, but there is no record of such an officer. Gilbert de Motier, Marquis de Lafayette, (6 September 1757-20 May 1834) was commissioned a Continental major general on 31 July 1777, aged 19 years, 10 months, and 25 days, though he didn't receive large commands suitable for a general until he was 20. So there are some examples of young leaders who people followed from history. 

Someone invents a device that shoots bullets out of the air This is obviously almost impossible for humans to do and it would be difficult to make a machine that could physically aim a gun that quickly. However it might not be impossible, and if it isn't a laser would be one way to bypass such defenses.
