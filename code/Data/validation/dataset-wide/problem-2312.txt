One animal with which people may get into trouble when they do not expect it, are the feral Burros & feral Horses found in the Red Rock Canyon area. These animals are very accustomed to people & may approach hoping for food (don't feed them, it is against regulations), so they are generally not a threat, however, I have seen mother Burros react quite defensively when approached & their offspring are nearby. Aside from that, they may be prone to bite or kick if startled. 

This got me curious, & using Expansion anchors in construction applications got me looking. While I couldn't find anything specific to climbing applications & submersion, I did find a reference to 304 or 316 stainless steel being used in submerged marine environments (harsher than typical freshwater) by boat builders. To my knowledge, no expansion anchors are available in 304 SS, so you would be limited to 316. I did come across this fastener selector tool which does specifically mention expansion anchors being used in submerged applications (in concrete). It is worth noting that even bolts installed in high, dry desert locations will need to be replaced sooner or later, so it is a good bet that the more extreme environment will shorten their lifespan no matter what you do. Also, maybe of more importance here, is making certain not to allow different alloys to come into contact with one another for extended periods. Do not use two different alloys for the bolt & the nut, & if you leave your hangers on the bolts when not in use, make sure that they are stainless steel also. Allowing dissimilar metals to remain in contact with water will result in Galvanic Corrosion. Which essentially means the rusting process will happen much faster. Just a thought, but you may want to be especially wary if the bolts are installed in sandstone with a high Iron content, as it seems to me that the Iron in the sandstone could react much more strongly with the stainless in a submerged environment. Anyone else have any observations on the effects (or non-effects) of Iron containing sandstone on anchor bolts? My two cents; give it a try. Maybe just very carefully inspect each bolt before use after a submersion. Edit: It may also be worth firing an email off to a manufacturer: $URL$ Edit: Edit: Just did, waiting for response. Edit(x3): Didn't hear back from Fixe, so I emailed Hilti customer service with the following question:

Snowshoe size is a key factor in getting the right amount of flotation. Generally, the heavier the person or the lighter and drier the snow, the more snowshoe surface area is required. You can follow the snowshoe chart here. 

Fire. As Kevin's comment said, carefully. I am surprised that was the only mention of fire so far. Benefit over "just use your body to dry clothes" The other answers take at least hours, sometimes days, and that is generally assuming you can use your body heat as a resource at all, as opposed to needing to heat yourself up as well. In my personal experience, if my clothes are wet enough that I want them drier, then I do not want to be sharing body heat. So, fire is both faster and more versatile for warming clothes, so if the conditions are bad enough, just make a fire. Details When I want to get warm and dry, I make a small fire. Small enough that it cannot flare up into a big one if I ignore it for a while, so that I can leave it while I work and keep coming back to it as needed; also small enough that I can get up very close to it. Large enough that anything held a few inches to a foot away for more than a few seconds starts to get hot. You can probably guess that hanging clothes over top of this fire is not generally a good idea, as it will get smokes and also drip water into the fire. On-Body Similarly to some other answers, I often dry my clothes on my body, but it is the fire doing the drying, not my body. In fact, after heating the clothes up, while they are on my body, the warm water then keeps me warmer too and it feels good. Warning!!! You must be very, very careful when doing this. If you stay close to the fire too long or get too close at all, obviously bad things will happen: depending on your type of clothing, it could melt, burn, or both melt and burn. Keep enough distance that you can get the fabric hot, but not nearly hot enough to ignite. I have caught clothes on fire before, but never as part of drying them, not even with 100% cotton clothes, though cotton usually ignites easily. When I step away from the fire after being close for 5-10 seconds using this technique, the wet areas of my clothes are at least warm, sometimes hot. If my clothes are completely soaked, then I often get them hot enough that I can see the water steaming off my clothes rapidly. But, another warning! Even if you do not get your clothes hot enough to burn, you can still be hurt by hot, steamy clothes. Multiple times, I have warmed up a wet pant leg or shirt that was not flat against my skin and gotten a surprise when I stood up and the material pressed back against my skin again, wet but hot. When doing this, I generally have to repeat often. Either because I'm very wet and each application of heat last long enough to get out only some fraction of the water, or because the conditions are wet and I keep getting wet such as when working in light rain or snow. This works well, but I cannot stress enough how careful you must be. Negligence will lead to injury. If you are getting cold enough that you are having difficulty feeling the heat, then you are very likely to damage yourself by overheating; please do not over-expose yourself to the fire due to lack of feeling after you have been over-exposed to the wet and cold! In this situation, you must get help. I have done this multiple times, but here's my best anecdote... One time I did this after being fully submerged under water; it was either late fall or early winter, and it was cold enough that there was some thin ice over parts of the water. After surfacing from the water, I chilled so fast in the breeze I have no doubt that I would have become hypothermic if it weren't for the fact that we had prepared ahead of time with a fire near the shore specifically for warming/drying on. Because of the fire, I only got cold enough to shiver for a while but was otherwise fine and resumed normal activities within an hour. Whenever I see people doing cold weather activities where water is involved (or could accidentally be involved) without a fire ready, it makes me cringe. Fires are an important tool. Off-Body Now, if your clothes are not on your body, you can still use the fire obviously. In this case, do not put them as close to the fire as you might while they are still on your body; since you will likely be leaving them there longer, they can be further away. Also, use fire-heated rocks to keep the clothes warm enough to dry faster. Be careful though that you do not heat the rocks too much. If the rock has heated up enough that I cannot touch it at all without burning myself, then I will not use it to warm anything flammable. Summary In short, and to quote Kevin's comment: "(Carefully) by a fire" 

So it sounds as though while submersion is okay, a volume of water collecting behind the bolt, freezing & pushing the bolt out or cracking the rock is their main concern. 

A similar caution should be taken with Desert Bighorn Sheep. Although you are unlikely to get near them, males will act aggressively if they feel they need to defend their herd. Black Widow spiders & Tarantulas are also present. Though neither are actively aggressive towards humans. One other thing to watch out for; the Teddy Bear Cholla. If you have an unexpected encounter with one of these, you will not soon forget it! Bits of them will, shall we say stick with you. 

I think the simplest answer is also the best in this case. This should work for (what I presume is) the majority of rationing cases. 

The wide array of answers here, and disagreements in the comments, only helps when I give you the dreaded answer that nobody likes to hear: It Depends. Everyone has their own opinions about what is important and what is not important. Fortunately for most of it, what it depends on is you. Safety (Generally, "Must Have") There are a very few things that are absolutely essential which you definitely should have for safety reasons, unless you are willing to risk your safety for reduced weight (I advise against it)... 

Personally, I think you should be okay with your boots. You will have to walk slowly, but you should do fine. It may be beneficial to walk around with a walking stick in spots and try to avoid the ice if you encounter it. I do not know what kind of snow you will encounter at Big White, but they do offer rentals at the Big White Ski Resort, if need be. Another tip I would suggest is that you follow the Daily Snow Report, just before leaving for Canada, so you can have information on the Big White Terrain & Ski Conditions. I would be more concerned about the temperature than the snow. I live near Vancouver and this year has been exceptionally cold for us and Kelowna is 271 km away from here by plane or 389 km by car. A curious side note: Australia Day is just around the corner! If you're Australian or not, come and celebrate everything that is great about 'Down Under' on January the 26th. Wear your best Australian gear and meet Boomer the Kangaroo at the top of Kangaroo run at 10am. More info here. 

A quick google search turned up a reasonable answer. The following looks like good general set of rules, but it may vary depending on where you are, which you didn't say. Source for the following 

It looks like a Burl. They are natural non-harmful (think of them like scar tissue maybe, resulting from injury or infection) deformities in the grain of trees. Both hardwood & softwood trees can develop burls. (FWIW, I'd guess based on the bark & needles laying in the folds of the bark in the first picture that this tree is some sort of conifer.) 

Get at the drier wood on the inside Try to dry out the firewood as best you can, if that is possible. Either way, make sure that you cut into the wood; as long as the wood is only wet on the surface, you can get drier wood on the inside. To get at the drier wood, you can use a bladed tool (generally knife or hatchet) to cut off the wet outer part. Also make sure you split the wood as much as you are willing to do; the increased surface area will help a lot toward getting the wood to catch fire. Use lots of tinder and kindling; as much as you can make Even more importantly is to use a lot of tinder and kindling. When I light in wet conditions, sometimes I spend most of my time making a pile of wood shavings with my knife. I make enough of them that I have a reasonably large pile to light, and plenty more to keep adding if the larger pieces are having a hard time catching. Have extra tinder on hand for the same reason, in case the shavings themselves are too moist, or in case the fire goes out and you need to re-start it. On top of your tiny kindling, keep working your way up to slightly larger pieces; do not suddenly jump from small kindling to very large pieces of wood. Some methods for more extreme wetness If you are trying to start a fire while it is currently raining, as opposed to after a rain, it can be even more difficult. I have found that the humidity and rain are sometimes bad enough that no amount of kindling will do: the tinder and kindling are becoming too wet simply by being in the wet air. When your resources are this wet, you need to use something that catches easily and burns hotter, like fat-wood, magnesium, or super-fine steel wool. You can even combine these things: my father likes to use magnesium and fat-wood together. Fat wood Fat-wood is a naturally occurring kind of wood which is saturated with resin. You can also make a home-made variant by soaking wood in flammable resins. It catches a spark or flame relatively easily, and it burns hotter and longer than normal wood. You then continue as before, working your way up with larger pieces of wood, once this has helped you get your start. Take some very small shavings off of it, and some larger shavings. You can even make toothpick-sized kindling and bigger if you're having a hard enough time. Usually, you make tinder and kindling from it then put what's left of your fat-wood piece away to help with more fires later, but if you need the fire fast or bad enough, or if it's a short trip or have plenty to spare, you can put what's left of your fat-wood stick in over your fat-wood tinder and kindling since whole fat-wood sticks help too. Magnesium Magnesium burns super-hot; many thousands of degrees. The magnesium for fire starting comes in a small block, and you scrape some of it off the block to make a small pile of scrapings/shavings. Then, usually a spark is applied by using a ferro rod; as long as the spark lands directly on the tiny magnesium shavings it should give you a super hot spot for a very brief time which you use to get your damp tinder and kindling lit. Steel wool Steel wool, the super-fine grade stuff, burns quite hot too. I once saw someone completely submerge it under water, take it out and shake it off for a minute, then drop a spark on it with a ferro rod. He then blew on it for a few seconds, and it was hot enough that kindling on it starting catching. Charcoal When conditions are very poor, my preferred method is to use charcoal. If I can get even a tiny spot on the charcoal to glow red, I can then blow on it to increase the size and heat of the red spot, then I hold a second piece of charcoal up to it so that it too can start getting hot; once the two of them are working together, it is easy to keep working up from there, possibly with even more small pieces of charcoal if the conditions are bad enough. This technique requires a lot of blowing. Be prepared to be exhausted after. Also, once it starts to smoke, try to turn away quickly to breathe, and be prepared to accidentally inhale some smoke that will choke you out for a moment. The up-side to this technique is that the charcoal burns hot, and you can keep forcing it to stay hot by continually blowing on it; so much so, that I have multiple times skipped kindling entirely and jumped straight from small pieces of charcoal to larger pieces of wood. Of course, lots of kindling is still helpful, and it will save some of your breathe. When all else fails, I get the initial charcoal red spot by applying a bic lighter to a sharp corner on the piece of charcoal. Counter intuitive method: use green wood This next one sounds completely counter-intuitive, but I have used it successfully. This one is back to wet conditions after a rain, not during the rain, and it only works if you have a nice, sunny day after the rain. Putting objects out under a bright sun, especially if it's mid-day, can help dry things out a lot better. Smaller, thinner objects are going to dry out even faster, and this is good for your tinder. Grab up a thin, live (yes, still green) branch from a tree. Scrape the bark away (if it is a kind of bark that is good for starting fires, then obviously use it as well), then start scraping at the inner wood. Try to keep the stuff you scrape off the wood to be as thin as you can possibly make it. I find it works best for me if I hold my knife perpendicular (straight up and down) on the wood and just scrape side to side, instead of whittling into the wood. Sometimes I even use the 90-degree corner on the back of my knife instead of using the actual blade, and I scrape this back and forth along the inner wood of the thin branch. I do this for a long time, building up as large a pile as I can. These ultra-thin shavings are so thin that, by the time I am done, the first half of what I worked on is much drier. But now it's time to make them even better yet; go spread this tinder bundle out in the direct sunlight for 10 to 30 minutes to dry them out even more. Because they are so super thin, they dry out very fast in the sunlight. That is why I use green wood instead of dead wood for this part; I have found that I can get the shavings even thinner than I can with dead wood. Once it dries out in the sun for a quarter hour or half hour, now it's dry wood and it's super thin which is great for tinder. With green wood, I can get the stuff I scrape off so thin that sometimes it looks fuzzy instead of woody. And since it is so thin, which is good for lighting, I have a few times gotten it to light after a rain even without the sun-drying, though don't skip the sun step if it's shining. Yes, this sounds crazy and counter-intuitive. I saw a guy do it on YouTube and thought "He must be crazy for choosing green wood," until he explained it and actually got a fire lit with it. I had to try it to make sure he wasn't pulling our leg, and it worked great! Conclusion Whatever you do, make sure you have multiple alternatives available to you. I keep multiple tools in my pocket-sized tinder box. It has a tiny piece of fat-wood, a few scraps of char cloth, a few tiny pieces of charcoal, a small chunk cut off of a magnesium block (spot reserved, it's not currently there), and a small ferro rod removed from its handle. Sometimes I have a tiny tinder-nest in there too from the afore-mentioned scrapings off a thin, green stick. With all of those options, it is rare that I need anything else to get a fire started even in wet conditions. 

Nettles should be blanched to destroy the formic acid before eating (Handle with gloves of course). Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a boil & prepare a bowl of ice water on the side. Once the water is boiling, plunge the nettles in the water for no more than a minute or so (the nettles should be bright green & not over cooked). Quickly drain the nettles & then plunge into the ice water. From here use them as you would any other cooked greens like spinach. You could use nettles in place of spinach in a spinach artichoke dip, as a pesto, as pizza topping, or marinated with garlic & olive oil and served over a steak or chicken breast. I also like them mixed in with pasta dishes. 

It has been a while since I actually did fishing on a beach, but when I do, it is always with someone. We usually get there early enough so we can get some bait for fishing (sea worms from under the rocks). For getting your line farther out into the ocean, you could go with either suggestion you mentioned. I could suggest getting a longer rod, as you would have better balance and movement than going into the water. Nevertheless, I would like to throw out a third possibility to you. If you are fishing with a friend, get him to hold onto your rod as he points it in the direction you would like to cast, keeping the bail open while you throw the line out by hand! What? Throwing the line out by hand! Take the slack part of you line and place yourself several meters away from your companion and start circling the end of your line over your head with the weights and baits. As the speed of your line turns faster, you should be able to detect an increasing buzzing sound around you. When the speed of your "lasso" is at its maximum, simply let it go in the direction you would like your line to travel in. Believe me this little trick will get your line much further out than any 14 foot rod. It works wonders. On occasion, I have done this without a friend, by simply placing my rod handle into a holder which I anchored into the sand. However I find that a friend holding your rod works better. 

Red Rock Canyon & Valley of Fire have very heavy human visitation, so any large predators are likely to be scarce (Mountain Lions & Bobcats). Coyotes are present, but unless cornered will not give you any problems. The mostly likely encounter with 'dangerous' wildlife you might have would be with Rattle Snakes. There are several species, some more aggressive than others, found in the Mojave & Great Basin regions, although they are not very active during the colder winter months during which you are planning on visiting, however may seek out warm areas near humans. I have spent several years hiking & camping in the Mojave & have only ever come across exactly 3 rattlesnakes. Also remember that rattle snakes will not always rattle, especially if cold. There are several species of scorpions as well, however the stings of most are really no worse than a wasp sting, unless you have immune system issues or a particular sensitivity. (There are wasps too). The scorpion present in southern Nevada with the most potential for a deadly sting is the Arizona Bark Scorpion, it is to my knowledge not native, but I have found them in Las Vegas, most likely an introduced population or a lone hitchhiker. Note the wide body & coloring for identification. Scorpions are also not very active in colder months, however may seek out warm areas near humans as well.
