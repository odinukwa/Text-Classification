Government control of all food. Without sufficient food an additional child cannot be kept alive. If every person goes to a government controlled distribution point every time they need food, the government has precise control over how much each person receives. If you want sufficient food for a new child you have to request it. If your child wasn't approved they won't give you food for them. Perhaps they would instead take the child and raise them as a ward of the state. If this pattern has been long established it may be culturally ingrained. People teach their children this is how it works. Everyone knows that if you try to have children without government approval they will be taken. If the past circumstances that alarmed the Elders included severe reduction of the places on the planet that will grow food, the government might have easily taken control of all of these areas. Perhaps the staple food isn't even grown at all but instead is a synthetic production. 

Long term survival of the species by means of cannibalism is simply not possible. Without any other mechanism to put energy in the system it is simply not sustainable. The stronger will eat the weaker and then the last remaining will starve to death. Although a vast population spread over a large area could take quite a while before complete extinction. Consider that even on Earth, with its countless species of life, there is no such thing as a self-sustainable ecosystem. For the vast majority of ecosystems on the planet, save for deep sea creatures, 90% of the energy actually comes from the outside - namely that is solar radiation, a.k.a sunlight. A simplified foodchain energy pyramid puts every step of the pyramid at an order of magnitude less energy content. Meaning that plant matter constitutes only 10% of all incoming solar radiation energy, primary consumers only 10% of plant matter, and so on. 

tend to have a harder time flowing past each other, and thus are more viscous. Some examples of real-life lava materials, in order of decreasing viscosity (again from this wikipedia page): 

Hotter planets will have less viscous lava This one is pretty self-explanatory, since the hotter the temperature, the less solid almost all materials tend to be. Also, from the Wikipedia page on lava compositions: 

"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." -Arthur C. Clarke (more info) In other words, you should treat magic like another form of technology. Other answers have tried to argue that using magic over technology precludes the need for both education and research, but in all magic systems I can think of: 

In just 4 generations, or 8 short years that population will be reduced to only 3 individuals, which will have quite the dilemma - breed or eat, presuming you still have members of both genders, and of with the prospect of no more food whatsoever. In reality it will be even worse, much, much worse than the theoretical worse, because younglings will have a really hard time taking down adults, and parents will have higher energy expenditures and less chance overwhelming another adult to feed themselves and their offspring until it is large enough to hunt. It will be far more likely that adults consume the young, because of the energy disadvantage their parents are put into. There will be a lot less additions to the population than the theoretical number and extremely slim chance than any newborn reaches maturity. In practice, it will be nothing short of a miracle if the population is not completely extinct in 5 years or less. 

One scientist referred to lobotomies as "surgically induced childhood," which would certainly be a solution to a criminal having too much intellect for their own good. 2. Brain-eating creatures In some universes there are creatures that feed upon the brains of humans, while leaving the rest of their bodies intact. For example, Mind Flayers in D&D or Ceti Eels in Star Trek both affect the brains of sentient beings in a very damaging way. However, this method has the greatest potential for getting out of hand and reducing the victim to a vegetative state, or killing them completely -- therefore, those inflicting the punishment would need to exert strict control over the creature that was unleashed on the victim's brain, stopping them as soon as their brain has been damaged enough. 3. Intellect-affecting spells If magic is a part of your world, a permanent variation of a Confusion or Curse spell could very effectively prevent their scheming. Another option is a spell of Bad Luck, which if powerful enough (and again, permanent) could effectively prevent them from making any significant intellectual breakthrough, thus foiling all their plans before they even happen. 

Forgive me science if this is too absurd. Disperse into the atmosphere molecules with 2 characteristics: 

Their atomic nuclei are unstable enough to be smashed together (nuclear fusion) if they impact other molecules in the air at velocities that a bullet pushing the air can cause. Make the energy released enough to smash the bullet. The new element produced by the nuclear transmutation is solid and strong enough to mostly contain the released energy (so that the energy release is localized and doesn't eg destroy the entire town). 

Summary If you are looking to make a lava lake that creatures can plausibly swim through, a mixture of super high temperatures and compositions of iron and magnesium will most likely yield the best results. 

If the people in the alternate reality in question have a basic knowledge of genetics: Females have only X sex chromosomes while males have both an X and a Y. The Y chromosome is inseparably connected to their spirit in a way that X chromosomes never are. Since these are the chromosomes responsible for developing a person's reproductive system, the reproductive contribution of a male is the spirit, where the female's is everything else. If they don't: To be honest, you probably don't even have to explain anything. Just state what happens as you did in the question and that'll be enough of an explanation on its own. 

Now, eliminate every other food source save for cannibalism. It will probably be worse than 10x decrease, for the sake of simplicity assume that a predator reaches maturity in 2 years, and all predators are cannibalized at that age, it would take on average consuming 1 member of the species monthly for 2 years, or 24 in total for the system to produce another "ready to eat" adult animal. Now, if you have a 24 fold decrease for every iteration, it is quite obvious that sustainability is entirely out of question, and you have an example population size, it is trivial to calculate how many generations it will take until extinction. Let's assume a rather numerous population of 1 million: 

Depending on the tech level of your world, I see a few different solutions being plausible. 1. A lobotomy (as mentioned by A.C.A.C. in the comments) reduces the amount of complexity a person's brain can handle, by simply cutting out a portion of the physical brain. Lobotomies were widely used as a treatment for mental disorders in the 1940s and 50s: 

Basically, even for viscous materials, heat tends to destroy any bonds between the molecules, allowing them to slide past each other more easily, and making the liquid less viscous. Chemical composition plays a big part too Viscosity can be defined as "resistance in the flow of a liquid." Therefore, materials with molecules that:
