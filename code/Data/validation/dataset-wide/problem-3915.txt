Find any $2n \times 2n$ matrix $A$ whose eigenvalues are $e^{\pm i \theta}$. Find a positive definite quadratic form preserved by $A$. In equations, we want $A P A^T = P$. Find an orthonormal basis for $P$, using the Gram-Schimdt algorithm. In equations, we want $S P S^T = \mathrm{Id}$. 

Someone should actually record the formula. If $p$ is a prime $\equiv 1 \bmod 4$, then $$\sqrt{p} = \sum_{k=1}^{p-1} \left( \frac{k}{p} \right) \cos \frac{2 k \pi}{p}$$ where $\left( \tfrac{k}{p} \right)$ is the quadratic residue symbol. Note that $\left( \tfrac{k}{p} \right) = \left( \tfrac{p-k}{p} \right)$, so every term appears twice. Similarly, if $p \equiv 3 \bmod 4$, then $$\sqrt{p} = \sum_{k=1}^{p-1} \left( \frac{k}{p} \right) \sin \frac{2 k \pi}{p}.$$ Again, $k$ and $p-k$ make the same contribution. These are usually both written together as $$\sqrt{(-1)^{(p-1)/2} p} = \sum_{k=1}^{p-1} \left( \frac{k}{p} \right) \exp \frac{2 k \pi i}{p}.$$ This is a formula of Gauss. 

Yes, it is possible. People who have done excellent tropical work with little Algebraic Geometry background include Federico Ardila, Michael Joswig and Josephine Yu. (I hope I won't insult any of these people by saying that they do not strike me as having much algebraic geometry.) However, I have had bad luck introducing people to tropical geometry without talking about valued fields, Grobner degenerations, toric varieties and the other algebraic technology. I can give a nice colloquium talk or write a nice expository paper where I gloss over this material. But this leaves the reader without an intuition to figure out which questions are reasonable to ask, or any idea of where nontrivial results might come from. This is especially true because so much tropical work right now is not solving specific problems formulated by experts, but in finding the definitions and theorems to make precise the phenomena which people have observed. ADDED I also like Ben's answer. There are parts of tropical geometry which use very serious algebraic geometry, but there are also parts where it is being used for motivation and intuition. You could probably get a lot of what you need from Cox-Little-O'Shea, Fulton's "Algebraic Curves" and some good reference on Grassmannians and hyperplane arrangements. 

Let $\Phi$ be a finite crytallographic root system. Let $\Phi^+$ be the positive roots and $\alpha_1$, ..., $\alpha_n$ be the simple roots. For $\beta = \sum c_i \alpha_i$ in $\Phi^+$, we define $h(\beta) = \sum c_i$. For $\beta = \sum c_i \alpha_i$ and $\gamma = \sum d_i \alpha_i$, we define $\beta \preceq \gamma$ iff $c_i \leq d_i$ for all $i$. Many sources state that $\Phi^+$ is graded by $h$. The nontrivial part of this statement is that, if $\alpha \leq \gamma$ with $h(\gamma) - h(\alpha) \geq 2$, then there is a root $\beta$ with $\alpha \leq \beta \leq \gamma$. Could someone give me a proof or reference to a proof, other than type by type check? To show that I haven't been completely lazy: Humphreys defines $\Phi^+$ and $h$ but doesn't state that $h$ grades $\Phi^+$, Bjorner and Brenti define a different, unrelated partial order on $\Phi^+$ which they call the root poset. Cuntz and Stump cite Armstrong Section 5.4.1 but it doesn't seem to be in there. 

Let $X$ be a smooth projective variety and $D$ a log-canonical divisor and let $U = X \setminus D$. I have heard the slogan "log-canonical is just as good as normal crossings for Hodge theory". This question concerns how to make that slogan precise as applied to the cohomology of $U$. If $D$ were normal crossings, then $H^{\ast}(U, \mathbb{C})$ would be the hypercohomology of the complex $\Omega^p(\log D)$ on $X$. Moreover, the spectral sequence of that hypercohomology would degenerate at $E_1$. I could compute the weight filtration on $H^{\ast}(U, \mathbb{C})$ by filtering $\Omega^p(\log D)$ according to how many poles my $p$-forms have along $D$. What are the analogous statements for a log-canonical divisor? Let me emphasize that I would like statements which are true on $X$, without passing to a resolution of singularities. 

The point of this answer is to point out some observations that do not fully answer the case of more than two Schubert classes. Let $\lambda^1$, $\lambda^2$, ..., $\lambda^r$ be the partitions, with the parts of $\lambda^i$ being $(\lambda^i_1, \lambda^i_2, \ldots, \lambda^i_c)$. We want to know the smallest $\mu_1$ such that $\sigma(\mu)$ occurs in $\sigma(\lambda^1) \sigma(\lambda^2) \cdots \sigma(\lambda^r)$. We have the following inequalities: $$\mu_1 \geq \sum \lambda^i_{j_i} \ \textrm{for any}\ j_1+j_2 + \cdots + j_r = r(c-1)+1. \quad (\ast)$$ $$\mu_1 \geq \left\lceil \frac{1}{r} \sum |\lambda^i| \right\rceil. \quad (\dagger)$$ When $r=2$, inequality $(\dagger)$ is the average of inequalities $(\ast)$ and is thus implied by them, but that isn't true for $r > 2$. For example, if $c=2$, $r=3$ and $\lambda^1=\lambda^2=\lambda^3=(1)$, then $(\ast)$ only forces $\mu_1 \geq 1$ but $(\dagger)$ forces $\mu_1 \geq \lceil 1.5 \rceil = 2$. Inequalities $(\ast)$ are all of the Horn inequalities which are of the form $\mu_1 \geq \mbox{something}$. (See, for example, this survey and note particularly Section 13 for the relation to Schubert calculus.) However, the example of $c=2$, $\lambda^1=\lambda^2=\lambda^3=(1)$ shows that sometimes condition $(\dagger)$ imposes an additional condition. My guess would be that $(\dagger)$ and $(\ast)$ are NOT enough to give the answer in general, but I don't have a counterexample yet. 

The answer should be that there are no non-constant maps from tropical curves of genus zero to tropical abelian varieties. By "should" I mean that there are a lot of definitions of these things in the literature and it would be frustrating to write an answer which is correct for every definition, but any definition which doesn't have this consequence is a "bad" definition. Here is why. A tropical curve of genus zero is a metric tree $\Gamma$. In particular, it is simply connected. So any continuous map $\phi: \Gamma \to \mathbb{R}^g/\Lambda$ lifts to a continuous map $\Gamma \to \mathbb{R}^g$, which can't obey the balancing condition at a leaf. One caveat: I could imagine someone making a definition (though I haven't see it) which would allow $\mathbb{R}$, with its standard metric, as a tropical genus zero curve with two punctures; $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ with the quotient metric as a tropical genus $1$ curve, and the covering map as a tropical map. This is precisely analogous to the analytic map $\mathbb{C}^{\ast} \to \mathbb{C}^{\ast}/q^{\mathbb{Z}} \cong E$ for some $q \in \mathbb{C}$ with $0 < |q|<1$. 

The standard notation is $\widehat{\mathbb{Z}}$. The names I know are "the profinite completion of $\mathbb{Z}$" and "$\mathbb{Z}$-hat". 

For $n=2$, the growth of $S(r)$ is actually significantly slower than i707107's bounds would suggest. I will show that $A_t = O(t r^2)$, not $t r^3$, and hence $S(r) = O(r^2 \log r)$. I can also establish the lower bound $S(r) > c r^2$, so $2$ is the correct exponent. Let $A(r,t)$ be the number of $2 \times 2$ matrices with $||A|| \leq r$ and $|\det A| \leq t$, $\det A \neq 0$. We will show $A(r,t) \leq C r^2 t$ and $A(r,1) \geq c r^2$ for some constants $c$ and $C$. The upper bound: We will count the number of matrices $\left( \begin{smallmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{smallmatrix} \right)$ with $0 < |\det A| \leq t$, $||A|| \leq r$ and $|d| = \max(|a|,|b|,|c|,|d|)$. Multiplying by $4$ then gives an upper bound on $A(r,t)$. We break up our count according to $GCD(c,d)$. First, let's count the terms with $GCD(c,d)=1$. Fix a particular $(c,d)$. For each $u$ between $-t$ and $t$, the equation $ad-bc=u$ determines $b \bmod d$. Combined with the condition $|b| \leq |d|$, there are only two values for $b$, given a fixed $(c,d)$ and a fixed value for $\det \left( \begin{smallmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{smallmatrix} \right)$. And, $(b,c,d,u)$ determines $a$. There are $O(r^2)$ choices for $(c,d)$, and $O(t)$ choices for $u$, so such terms contribute $O(t r^2)$ to our count. Now, let's do the case where $GCD(c,d) = g$, say $c = g c'$ and $d = g d'$. The equation $ad-bc=u$ is only solvable at all when $g|u$, which is for $O(t/g)$ values of $u$. In that case, $b$ is determined modulo $d'$. Combined with the inequality $|b|\leq d$, this gives $O(d/d') = O(g)$ choices for $b$. So, for each $(c,d)$, there are $O(g) O(t/g) = O(t)$ ways to complete it to a $(a,b,c,d,u)$ quintuple. The number of $(c,d)$ pairs with $GCD$ equal to $g$ is $O(r^2/g^2)$. So our bound is $O \left( \sum_g t r^2/g^2 \right) = O(t r^2)$. The lower bound There are $(6/\pi^2 - o(1)) r^2$ pairs $(c,d)$ with $GCD(c,d)=1$ and $|c|, |d| \leq r^2$. For each of these, we can find $(a,b)$ with $|a|$, $|ab| \leq \max(|c|, |d|)$ and $ad-bc=1$. So there are $(6/\pi^2 - o(1)) r^2$ matrices contributing to $A(r,1)$. (It is easy to improve this constant, but probably not worthwhile.)
