What you are carrying and where you are carrying it are very important in deciding what vehicle to use. If I am going on a bike camping trip where I know I don't need to deal with walking stretches (like stairs, steep hiking trails), I'm much more likely to take my Xtracycle rather than my short diamond frame bike plus trailer. If I have to negotiate areas where I will need to pick my bike up to deal with stairways, I will mix a trailer and panniers as neceesary. If I need to haul kids, I might choose the Xtra. If I need to go long distances and don't need to negotiate steep climbs, a recumbent with a trailer is a very comfortable operation. If you prefer to ride a recumbent bike and don't need a trailer, a Cargo Monster might interest you. Eugene's Human Powered Machines also makes heavier duty hauling trikes. You might want to consider an electric assist option as well. Clever Cycles StokeMonkey is an adaptation I've seen on Xtracycles before, there are other electric assist conversions out there. Lightfoot cycles also makes electric assist recumbent trikes. Many bicycle life-stylists have different bikes for different purposes. If you need to haul lumber, I would suggest a bike that can carry a long (8+ foot) aluminum utility trailer. If you carry lots of boxy items and want a the lowest center of gravity, you might prefer a long john like a Bullitt or CETMA cargo bike. Lightfoot cycles appears to make a cargo trike with a locker on the back, which might be appropriate if you're hauling valuables like medicines. Your terrain and weather will also affect your choice. Bicycles might handle better in snow than trikes, but you might prefer a trike with studded tires if you want to carry a load on plowed, icy streets. If you are out in the wilderness where you might need to handle power snow, slush, ice and gravel, you might want to consider a Surley Pugsley (with 4-inch wide tires) and towing a trailer. You might invest in multiple bikes as your tasks and seasons dictate. 

Eat more. Seriously. Any exercise will cause a little weight loss and if you're really looking to challenge yourself mentally then that means more than a leisure ride. That means more calories. You'll have to learn what the right amount to eat is to not lose weight and then you can decide if you want to eat more to put on weight. 

You can generally find them pretty cheap (not this model but other ones). They're incredibly durable. Relaxing for when you do want those roaming around trips, but can also be pushed for the fitness side. And learning a new trick or jump will burn less calories so you don't lose weight. Loads of fun too! 

What would be the best way to get in to the left lane? I've seen cyclists there so I know it can be done, just never seen the whole process. I'm thinking after writing this: 

I have a Trek 7200 (Alpha aluminum frame) and it has two water bottle holder mountings, the top braze-on on the seat tube seems to have broken from over-tightening and has sunk into the frame. These braze-ons are recessed into the body of the frame tubes, as if they were somehow attached from the inside. Is it possible to repair this braze-on? Is it something some super-glue could help with, or am I looking at a permanent wound? 

I follow behind, but some topics need to be reviewed before and during the rides. And also, for all our best intentions, the group gets split, or you coast ahead or they drift behind. I tend to review these points with my family or picnic group: 

I like the baking soda comment. Depending on your humidity, you might be developing a mildew smell, which can also develop in cycling jackets if you ride in the rain frequently, too. If you have a warm sunny day, and can turn the bags inside out, sunning them can also be effective. If your bag gets damp (inside) frequently, dry it out promptly and wad up newspaper in it, and that should absorb moisture from a bag (works for gloves and shoes.) Soaking in a saline and vinegar solution can cut mildew solution. You can add garden herbs like sage or rosemary leaves. If this is not effective, I would move up to some Simple Green solution next. If those solutions are ineffective, you could also trest a small section of the bag with a TSP (trisodium phosphate). TSP is harsh so use gloves, safety glasses. This is probably safer than washing with a bleach solution, but doing a test on a section to determine if how it treats your material. 

get into the left lane right before the shopping center intersection when its still 2 lanes. staying right in the middle of that left lane forcing cars to slow down behind you if there are any cars. (Of course only taking the lane when there is ample time for the car to slow down) Get over into the (right-most) left turn lane once across the shopping center intersection. 

Is it considered bad etiquette to ride a road bike through a small residential area? Not talking about a cheap bike and riding on the sidewalk but a nicer road bike at a decent pace. I don't want to upset anyone by cutting through their neighborhood but it would be a lot easier for my commute. 

Pretty sure while making the screenshots I figured it out but I'll ask anyways since I went through the trouble. I don't plan on taking this Left for a long time, if ever (I'll either go Pedestrian to get across here until I'm more confident or take a different route). But this is the most direct route from my place to work. The issue is the road goes from 2 lanes and then gets a right turn lane and a left turn lane into shopping centers. Then after that it expands further to have 2 left turn lanes, 3 straight lanes, and 1 right turn lane. That's where I need to make the left. â€¢ 2 lanes getting ready to expand with the turn lanes into shopping centers: 

Hygiene standards can be a very personal point of view. Whatever it takes to enjoy staying hydrated is important to recognize here. For example, the most interesting advice I saw posted for a century ride recently was to place cucumber slices inside your water bottle to counteract the bottle taste. I keep my metal and plastic water bottles clean just as I would with other hand-wash dishes, no extra effort. Having lived in southern California and toted water bottled thru the desert on extended camping trips, and drank the "salad water" out of metal canteens and plastic jugs in 100F weather...I learned not to worry so much about it. (I always let my new water bottles soak in a baking soda solution to get the plastic taste out.) 

I've ridden through two winters in the Pacific Northwest, and while our winters might not get as frigid, I have formed similar conclusions to our fellows, but I would like to frame my answer from more of a preparedness point of view. 

I'm no expert in racing or anything but the calves shouldn't be activated almost at all when cycling to my knowledge. You're not extending the calves at the bottom of the stroke and the amount of pressure would be insignificant unless you're deliberately extending the calves while on a very hard gear / slope. If anything this calf extension would be less efficient. Calves are a very difficult muscle to train and requires serious weight. If you see a cyclists with large calves its most likely from one or a combination of the following: 

This is best done by picking difficult challenges that you enjoy. It could be getting a BMX bike and working to learn one trick after another. It could be setting a speed goal for yourself that really forces you to push yourself. It could be any number of things. Just set challenging goals and surround yourself with others that will push you to reach them. 

I suspect you might have either a loose headset or handlebar stem. I would take it back to where you bought it and describe the problem. If it's recently purchased, they would probably fix it under warranty. 

It's worth noting that if you shower regularly, raising a modest sweat on your ride probably won't make you stink. Cotton t-shirts can be almost as bad as polypro for raising a funk, tho. And if you do sweat, cotton t-shirts become cold wet, clingy blankets. As you continue commuting to work your stamina and pacing will improve and you will notice that those hills won't make you sweat as much. Avoid sprinting to work, postpone that urge of for the ride home :-) 

I've commuted on 26" MTBs and I made one a bit hybrid style by not chopping the fork tube down and had a much easier time on it. My other MTB I didn't get an extended stem for and I found it less comfortable. Both bikes I outfitted with full sized fenders, rear racks and handle bar bags. I would start with getting to know SPD pedals and shop around for a second bike. SPD pedals take some getting used to, and if your ergonomics are not tuned in, you might be exposing yourself to lower back strain and visiting a chiropractor. You don't want a tour cut in half for back problems...or clipless might just not suit your style. (Clipless pedals sell quickly if you decide you don't like them.) Also consider buying a small pocket metronome if you don't already know what 90rpm feels like. Building a bike up or rebuilding a used one is great, it will make you very familiar with how to fix it and tune its ergonomics as you go extend your riding range. I second the recommendation for a cyclocross style bike if you don't like the idea of a touring bike. Keep the ultimate tour route in mind: doing lots of hills? Get a gearing suited for hills. Credit card touring and not carrying much? Then you might not want to go for a bike with fork brazeons. If you're going to be carrying full panniers on the trip, consider sturdy wheels. There's no reason you couldn't tour on a 26" cromoly MTB, so long as you've adjusted the ergonomics to suit long rides. 26" wheels are often sturdier than 700c wheels, on a properly built wheel, shorter spokes break less often. (BTW, I don't want to get into a flame over wheels, there are many factors I'm omitting.) 

My feeling The bike you chose looks odd to me but if it makes you happy it also looks versatile and fun. I could see taking to some trails and little jumps on it. Otherwise the more I write the more I'm inclined to suggest a smaller BMX bike like: 

â€¢ This is the main intersection where I need to make the left. So I need to be in the right left turn lane (2nd lane from left): 

First and most important is the depression. You should really go to a bike shop and hop on a few different bikes and styles. Try them all. The one that makes you feel giddy and excited is the one to get. Pleasure, smiling, laughter, and exercise all release endorphins which help depression. Get the one that will not only give you exercise but also make you feel great! This is also how you will know if it is comfortable and fits you. 

Even if you use a trailer, you would want to lock the trailer frame with a cable through your chainstay and seatstay. I have seen pictures of Pelican boxes bolted to to the sides of racks. Set and setting (as Timothy Leary has put it) is important for transporting valuables. I've parked in the afternoons at my grocery store and found people come up to their bikes and discover their backpacks stolen...but I don't discover that situation early in the mornings. Your best protection might be avoiding times or localities that attract thieves. If you have friends that can accompany you on a trip, this is also an effective method of preventing theft. I have gone shopping with my family and often someone stays with the kids and watches the bikes. Or, if we're toting a trailer that doesn't lock to the bike frame, someone will wait outside. Other tactics, even though these can inconvenient and possibly more expensive, would be to a) load your panniers into your shopping cart to keep an eye on them, b) plan your trips so that you don't chain a enriching stop before a risky second destination, or c) have the item delivered. 

â€¢ Finally, its a bit hard to see but this is what it looks like from the light at the shopping center in the morning. You can see there's very little traffic at this hour and I'd actually have to leave 15-20 minutes earlier by bicycle so there would be even less. 

As far as the pain you may have gotten a Shin Splint. If you're doing BMX or Off-Roading where you're frequently doing jumps and tricks then the calves will play a much larger role in your cycling. 

â€¢ This is the shopping center intersection. The light further in the distance (500 ft in actuality) is where the intersection is. Cars would typically get in the second lane (not the left into the intersection but the one after that) and then as they cross the intersection get over into the turn lane. You can see this is what the SUV is doing in the picture. I would think this would then be the safest way for cyclists to do it as well but would have to take that lane so cars getting into the left don't cross into me: 

I have not found that tire size, or tire tread has made significant difference to me, I have learned you cannot ride on a snowy shoulder, you want to ride on the least snow or ice possible, otherwise you might just slide into the gully. Studs don't help with snow, deep tread might. For plain old wet weather, I have had no trouble with road tires, I didn't get any advantage from knobbies, in fact I replaced my MTB tires with road tires. Good luck with your commute! 

One of my most useful bicycles is my 58cm 700c Xtracycle based on a Novara Xpresso cyclocross style frame. Lately, as the kids are getting bigger and my back isn't getting any younger: I crave a much lower top bar. I would consider a used mixte frame, a step-through frame, or other really low diamond frame. Recommendations for sturdy and faithful frame models appreciated. Ability to handle 3 rings and 8 cogs plus a chain stay bridge preferred. These areas would help me evaluate the frames I might find:
