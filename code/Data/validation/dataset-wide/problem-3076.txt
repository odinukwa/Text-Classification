According to this source, Carthage remained a minor Phoenician outpost until after the fall of Tyre to Alexander the Great in 332 BC. At that time many of the wealthy citizens of Tyre, having ransomed themselves from Alexander, moved to Carthage and began the constructions that led to it rapidly becoming the wealthiest city of the Western Mediterranean. If accurate, that would undoubtedly place the construction of the Cothon in the time period between 332 BC and roughly 240 BC. According to this additional source (page 85, 2nd column) there were two distinct harbors by the time of Scipio's siege during the Third Punic War, both of which were completely enclosed and sheltered. The term Cothon apparently derives from the name of the small island in the middle of the larger, military, harbour. It would seem likely that the smaller Cothon was built first, later supplemented by construction of the larger, though I cannot source this yet. Here is another translation of the second source above. Update: Here is a modern satellite photo of the two ports. 

The Royal Sussex did not participate in the Relief of Chitral (1895) The Royal Sussex participated in the Tirah Campaign (1897-8), but only after your ancestor's departure on Nov. 5, 1897; relieving 1st Battalion, The Devonshire Regiment, in the main column later that month (page 206, footnote 1). Of course in order to promptly perform that relief the Sussex would have had to be trailing the main force, and your ancestor likely was wounded or invalided as part of that maneuver - witness the length of his stay in England while his regiment remained on active duty. 

Prior to the clearing of Cherbourg Harbour in August, 1944, these figures would have been substantially less. In the immediate aftermath of Antwerp's opening another 10,000 tons of supplies were off-loaded in just 3 days, setting a minimum for the monthly capacity of that port at around 100,000 tons. I suspect the actual capacity was far larger. 

Frederick was at least as capable a battlefield commander as Napoleon, who was himself probably only the sixth best French battlefield commander of his generation, after Davout, Desaix, Lannes, Massena, and Soult. Aside: Napoleon never truly mastered the battlefield use of any arm besides artillery, and in battles personally directed by himself over relied upon it. It is impossible to imagine Napoleon personally winning a battle such as Auerstadt, and the tactical abilities of Soult and Davout stand out as the cornerstone of Austerlitz. Contrast this with his overwhelming mastery of Grand Tactics, exemplified by his nearly bloodless destruction of an Austrian army at Ulm. However there is far more to being a great commander than simple battlefield prowess. Frederick and Napoleon were both exceptional at recognizing and promoting talent; and at commanding the loyalty of subordinates. A commander simply cannot win battles without capable subordinates, and so the recognition and selection of those is vital for an officer at every level. The notion that a commander's abilities should be deprecated because of his subordinates' skill is backwards - the skill of one's subordinates should be recognized as a positive indicator of a commander's ability. One might argue that for an army commander battlefield skill might actually be a contra-indicator, - tempting him to interfere in the operations of more capable subordinates. Frederick and Napoleon also both possessed an exceptional "*coup de l'oeil", or eye for terrain, and the "moral courage" to make difficult decisions, in a timely fashion, live with their consequences, and carry them to a successful conclusion. Berthier for one lacked the latter by 1809 and nearly lost the opening campaign of that year in consequence. Additionally, both Frederick and Napoleon introduced significant changes to how the warfare of their generation was practiced: Frederick through his re-discovery of the oblique order of battle and introduction of the quick bayonet charge following a small number of opening salvos; and Napoleon through the Corps d'Armee and the staff system reporting to Berthier. Note the important distinctions through the very intentional use of the terms "battlefield commander" and "battlefield use". While tactical skill and personal courage on the battlefield are vital characteristics of a junior or regimental officer, being a successful commander of large armies requires talent in many more areas, which I have only hinted at above. Douglas MacArthur is twice (Bataan and Korea) ruined by his complete disdain for logistics, as exemplified by his personal disdain for Eisenhower (his emphasis): "The best clerk I ever had." Lee is ruined at Gettysburg by his lack of imagination and slavery to doctrine, becoming so predictable that Meade can reposition artillery overnight to Cemetery Ridge in complete confidence that the next day's assault will come there. 

The Royal Sussex Regiment Brighton War Memorial notes the following timeline of deaths and activities: 

The moral: Attempting to reduce complicated decision and policy decisions to simple aphorisms is always a mug's game. 

it seems clear that the date of effect was deliberately chosen to ensure that Australia was legally in a formal state of declared war against Germany prior to the Westminster Adoption Act taking effect. Update #2 This interpretation is reinforced by the signed declaration beneath the Act by the Clerk of the House of Representatives (my emphasis again): 

From the Online Etymology Dictionary entry the Latin is given as praesidentum (nominative praesidens) meaning "president, governor", from whence English derived it via the Old French "president". The OED lists several usages dating from the 1370's and 1380's for both the appointed head of a territory or district (sense 1) and for the appointed or elected head of a committee or group who then presides over meetings (sense 2). The 1374 entry in the OED (sense 1) is the oldest I saw there. 

Through the musket era, formed troops prevailed through achieving higher rates of fire. With rates exceeding 4 shots per minute for Wellington's Peninsular veterans, and claimed to approach 6 shots per minute for Frederick's Prussian Guards, a rate of 2 per minute (as in the video) is horrendously bad for formed infantry. Likewise it seems clear that the running pace is slowed by the reloading effort. And formed troops cannot run at speed or for more than a few seconds without loosing cohesion. The questions then becomes: Under what circumstances is it desired to reload while running, with a significantly reduced rate of fire? I believe that the only such circumstance is as described for the Virginia borderer in the question. When badly outnumbered and small in number, so that slowing will result in becoming surrounded, it is imperative to keep moving. Note that the anecdote mentions the chase lasting over several miles, so a steady jog as in the video is quite fast enough. Only in this circumstance can I see value in reloading while running. Such a circumstance would have been much more common along the Appalachian frontier than anywhere on a 18th or 19th century European battlefield. 

In Once a Patricia, the memoir of Lt. C. Sydney Frost as platoon commander in Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry in Sicily (July-August 1943), Italy (August-September 1943 & September 1944 - March 1945), and Netherlands (March -May 1945), almost no mention of casualties is made except for the occasional "We lost so-and-so." The three exceptions are: 

While the veracity of this site on the history of crime may be doubtful, it appears to be the only easily located English-language source 

Although the Japanese attack was unexpected in its timing, The US Navy was well aware: (a) that the Japanese were in the habit of attacking before a formal declaration of war; and (b) that a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor was both possible and likely to be devastating, having itself simulated such an attack several times over the past 15 years as outlined here 

It is impossible to ascertain for sure. Eleven gods of the Greek major pantheon all lived in various named corners of the mountain. Even Zeus resided on only the second-highest of the many peaks, with the highest, Mytikas, reserved as their meeting pace.) This suggests that the ancient Greeks were familiar with the terrain of the mountain. The summit height is less than the 10,000 feet altitude where an oxygen supply might be advised, and while technical competency (and helmets) are necessary for a few of the many peaks, ropes are not necessary for any of them. Several of the lesser peaks can be hiked up with only good lungs and strong legs. At least 10,000 climbers/hikers ascend at least one of the peaks every year. However, the first known ascent of (the peak of) Mt. Olympus was only in 1913. Just remember - if one is a god, making yourself either scarce or invisible when an inquisitive human comes nosing around is a trivial feat. 

So to address the specific question: By the time of King Alfred it was already legally unacceptable in England to employ deadly force for the resolution of impromptu arguments. Punishment varied by era and circumstance, from hanging to monetary compensation, to forfeiture of property and chattels to the Crown as well as gaol time (in exchange for a Grace Pardon). One was, however, allowed to defend oneself from deadly attack, though at times only if physically constrained so as to make any thought of escape clearly impossible. During the Plantagenet era there is overwhelming circumstantial evidence that, in general, juries crafted statements of facts found specifically to enable the finding of self defence for defendants regarded by the community as being of good character and substantial societal value. This practice disappeared after the Tudor legal reforms redefined trial juries, removing their evidence gathering power and beginning the modern practice of making them impartial arbiters of the facts. Note also that for peers of the land, trial juries were composed exclusively of other peers of the land. 

Condition 3 is apparently the best forecast they give for most Antarctic stations, partly because of the great speed in which conditions can change. Note particularly the temperature requirement. Northern Quebec and Alberta never approached those temperatures in the 6 years I lived there. Even with all our modern technology, it is difficult to maintain an Antarctic station through the long winter. The notion that a pre0historic settlement could have somehow transported sufficient fuel from (not Patagonia as it doesn't have trees; The Falklands maybe, or the Cape, or Tasmania) in order to survive even one winter I find absurd. Only our technology provides us with the luxury, and means, for such research. 

Read Hornblower series by Forester and Aubrey series by O'Brien for the Napoleonic period. O'Brien's description of nautical life is generally thought to be more realistic, but Hornblower is based on a real-life character whereas Aubrey is entirely fictional. Henty has (at least one) nautical book set in Elizabethan period: Under Drake's Flag. 

Hippocrates was fascinated by twins, but the concept and understanding of scientific research was different then from now. In this work, St. Augustine writes on Cicero's commentary to Hippocrates' observations and speculations regarding one particular pair of brothers, who might have been twins. When the very question is that old, I believe attempts to identify the first such is doomed to be mired in speculation, personal opinion, and the political correctness of assigning it to this culture or that. For the sake of completeness, here is an 1875 study by Francis Galton.
