For me the worst part of getting rejected for a job is feeling worthless, like I'm not good at anything. To fight that specifically, I recommend spending time with friends. If you feel comfortable directly telling them that you're having a shitty time and could use some encouragement, definitely do that. If you can, do something nice for someone. Email a friend you haven't seen for a while and ask how they're doing, volunteer for something if you have the opportunity - this doesn't have to be in person, if there are any communities for newbies in your field, join them and answer questions, heck, just offer to help someone with their bags. The idea is to remind yourself that you have something to offer. If you like doing anything creative, do that. If you can create something, whether that's a meal, a blog post, a set of shelves, a knitted scarf, a painting, that proves that you matter because now there's something where there used to be nothing. Like other commentors have said, distraction is a good idea too. Take a break and do something fun. With friends if everyone's schedules allow, if not it's totally fine to spend an evening watching netflix, playing games, whatever works for you. And you know, sometimes you just need to feel your feelings until you're done. Rejection sucks, it's okay to feel bad about it. Maybe you need an evening watching sad movies and eating icecream and just being sad until you get bored of it (being sad is actually really dull, it won't take as long as you think). Don't forget that the people rejecting you for jobs have tons of applicants for every job and they're not judging you personally, they're judging your resume/cover letter by taking a quick glance at it. I help review resumes at my work and I'm sure I've rejected good people who just had bad resumes. Even if your resume is great, someone else's might be fantastic and just happen to be perfectly suited for that particular job. A huge part of job hunting is luck and numbers. Heck, maybe your resume is amazing but the hiring manager wants to hire a friend of theirs, or doesn't like the school you went to, or you just happened to use their least favourite buzzword. 

The governing statute in the US is the ESIGN ACT (text of statute). Generally, courts have treated the situation as "if both parties treat it as a signature, then so will we" (section 1-303 of the UCC calls this "course of performance, course of dealing and usage of trade"). I used to work for a company where we dealt with the signatures and attestations; ESIGN is a bit complicated as the supporting regulations also require things like the electronic documents be readable and provable for at least 10 years. PDF/A is an attempt to make PDF documents suitable for long-term archival. 

When folks start discussing politics, you can always demurr and say you are busy, or that you don't want to talk about it. Debates do not exist to change people's minds, they are performed to score points amongst the faithful of your own side. This is why both sides are claiming "my guy won!" 

No. In large companies, these policies are always concocted by people far distant from the front lines. Neither you nor your boss will be able to change them. The closest you might get will be to redefine your job with a new title. This is why many companies have job titles like "Business Analyst 3" so as to provide different pay bands for different levels of skill/talent/ability. In the case of my current employer [1], the only way to get more than a 3% raise was to quit and then get rehired. This was something done by most of the developers here. In my case, the pointy haired boss liked to lowball new hires [2], knowing full well that raises were almost impossible to get [3]. Quitting to work as a contractor yielded a $30k/year raise for myself [4]. These policies lead to people whining "we can't get qualified people" [5]. They are really saying "we can't get people to work at the wage we are willing to pay" [6]. There is really nothing that you, or your boss, can do to change the policies, so you'll have to vote with your feet. Or decide that there are more important things than money [7]. In some cases, the appeal to remote authority (perhaps a "policy" or "mean" executive) is a way for your boss to say "no" without sounding "mean" to you [8]. The only way to deal with this situation is to always be ready to move on. Notes: 1 - It is a privately owned company in the Fortune 500. 2 - Married new hires would automatically get $10k/year more than an equally qualified single worker. 3 - Unless there was a policy that year saying "people getting more than $X don't get raises this year", then everyone would get a 3% raise. Even people about to be fired for cause would get 2% raises. 4 - When hired back, I didn't get to stay at the new level, but basically I get about $20k/year more than I did when quitting about 1 year previously. 5 - Our office makes products that need lots of business domain knowledge. Even after "bridging" (where my absense was ignored/bridged to be the same [for some benefits] as if I never left, at "6 years" I am the lowest "seniority" person in this office. Many people have been working for this corporation for up to 19 years. They knew I left for more money, and with a recent deathmarch, they need folks who know what the product is and what the business is. 6 - Generally, when CEOs whine about a perceived shortage of talent, they are lobbying the government to save the businesses from the free market; they want talent but without paying the market wages for such talent. 7 - In one co-worker's case, he values time off more than high wages, even though he is the highest paid developer here. 8 - In the worst cases, this sort of appeal is done because the boss does not like filling out the paperwork and uses this as an excuse to avoid work. 

Don't. Nothing good will come of telling your boss that he killed your motivation. You can tell him that you feel frustrated or that you're disappointed that someone else was chosen to lead the latest project, but you will not accomplish anything by telling him he quenched the last bit of your motivation. What he's likely to take from a statement like that is that you've given up on this company and that there's nothing he can do to make you happy so he shouldn't bother. If you do leave, I personally recommend staying neutral in your exit interview. Why burn bridges if you don't need to? Save the venting for your friends, stay professional while you leave. 

You kind of can't, you're going to get turned down for all sorts of reasons. That said, it will never hurt your career to network more. By networking I don't mean acting like some awful slimy stereotype of a salesperson, I mean going to stuff like meetups and user groups and trying not to be a jerk. If you're especially lucky you'll directly meet a manager looking to hire, but even if you don't it's quite likely that you'll meet people who know someone who is looking to hire and can put in a good word for you. It's not necessarily fair but people just trust a friend of a friend more than they do a total stranger. 

That depends on how you ask it. "Can you give me an overview of the interview/hiring process at _____ Company?" is perfectly reasonable, where "So, how much longer is this going to take?" will probably go over poorly. It's a completely reasonable question to ask, you just need to not be a jerk when you ask it. 

Whenever I have had a coworker who puts blame on me for helping him, I've stopped helping him. No matter how pleasant they are, blaming others is a sign of incompetence or malevolence: they aren't responsible for the failure - you are. It is possible that by using your name to his superiors, he could be setting you up for discipline, or perhaps he grew up believing that any failure could be waved away with a suitable excuse to parents & teachers. If he's setting you up for failure, keep this old joke in mind: 

In the event that you are not going to file for back pay, a smart company would uses these timesheets to more accurately estimate the amount of effort it takes to get jobs done. If managers continue to estimate it takes 4 weeks to get a task done, and the people working on the task all work 20 hours of overtime each week, then it really takes 6 weeks to do the task - and future estimates should be adjusted accordingly. 

In the banking industry in the US, letting your boss know you are looking for another job can get you fired immediately. One bank I worked for monitored phone lines (and bathrooms) and if you were overheard to be looking for another job, the security department would have your boss and an armed guard at your desk the next morning to help you pack your things and leave. While this bank is an outlier, the doctrine of "at will employment" in the US means that giving your employer "too much notice" can result in you being fired. In the US, 2 weeks notice is customary when resigning. It is reasonably common enough that when you give your notice that you will be immediately escorted from the premises, so that informing supervisors that you are "looking" can be very risky. It is my experience in the US that you should have all your personal possessions out of the office before giving notice. 

I can't say without knowing what field you're in. In my field, software development, that would be extremely unusual and probably a red flag. In other fields with high turnover, it could be normal to need new people immediately and to interview them ASAP. 

On the upside, it sounds like you have plenty of time to find a job with a company that can handle such complicated HR procedures as not rejecting candidates the interviewers wanted to move forward with :) 

Yes and no. I don't think you should worry too much about being laid off as engineer, but you should worry that the culture of your office changing. I don't think it's unusual for C-level execs to leave after an acquisition, the acquiring company already has their own C-levels and the C-levels at the acquired company may not want to take demotions to VP or lower positions. That said I do think you should worry that things will change in ways that will make you miserable and prepare for that. Like the other answer said, it is not possible that nothing will change for you. Things will change, the only question is whether they'll change in a way you can live with. If I were you I would start networking / looking for new opportunities now so you can find a new job quickly if it turns out the way things change at your current job doesn't work for you. Good luck! 

Just like everything else in software development, it depends. Question answered, right? ;) More specifically, it depends on what size of team you like working in and what kind of company you like working for. I think the team size thing is a bit of a red herring, the way the company is run can make just about any size team a great experience or a terrible one. 

No. Determining if the fit is going to work both ways is part of the interviewing process. I would have phrased it more along the lines of "well, this isn't going to work out for either of us, so let's stop wasting each others' time and call it a day." Time is the most valuable thing we each have. No one has more hours in a day than the next person - we all get the same 24 hours per day. Wasting another person's time isn't a polite thing to do. It is a denial of service attack on their life. Some people are more about being in charge, and it is quite possible that they were enraged that some puny subject would reject King Manager. Upsetting someone's dominance ritual usually leads to fights on the school playground, or in the ghetto. You'll also see them played out as "you can't quit, you're fired" with "you can't fire me, I quit" being shouted around. 

Bruce Webster coined the phrase "thermocline of truth" to describe situations like this. Eliminating the "information sink" requires political and managerial help from above the point where truth stops flowing uphill. 

In some cities/states, sexual orientation is a protected class like race or gender. In such a place, this is clearly a "hostile work environment". I would first ask the people to stop. If they don't, then start a diary with names and dates. Keep this diary at home, or in your purse/murse/briefcase. Read Corporate Confidential at home before approaching your boss or HR. HR does not work for you, their job is to protect the company. In the past, when I've been around such coworkers, I take 2 different tactics. One tactic (shame) is to turn it around by saying things like "really? You wouldn't say that about a black person would you? Or are you that bigoted?" Another (taking the bite out of the remarks) is to camp it up and set the dial to 11. Such as telling a man who is saying a homophobic remark something like "oh hun, you just haven't met the right man yet." It takes time to determine what works better for each person. 

Could mean anything, I don't think it's worth worrying about. You clearly have enough experience to get first interviews, so it could be that the employers found someone else with more experience or it could be a little while lie that HR tells you when they just liked the other candidate better. The thing with interviews is that they're fundamentally a crapshoot. To quote an excellent article about technical interviews (the whole thing is pretty long but well worth reading): 

Yes, it's a social custom. Somebody who goes to the trouble of buying a nice purse and taking good care of it doesn't want potentially gross floor grit staining it. It's also rude to move other people's things without asking permission. 

Whether you know this for a fact or whether you're assuming it based on your research, the way around it is networking. Go to local meetups for backend devs (if there aren't any in your city, starting one would look great on a resume), make a token effort to be friendly (offer to help tidy up and the organizers will love you), and you will meet people who either are hiring managers or who can introduce you to them. 

I think specific titles on a resume are less interesting than details about what you did, so you shouldn't worry too much about that. Everyone who has been in the industry long enough to be reviewing resumes as part of their job has seen bad developers with senior titles and great ones with junior titles. Just describe what you did on your resume and you'll be fine. 

Generally, GPA is something one would only include on resumes for the first 1 or 2 jobs out of school, and only if it is very good. There is a dissertation that I think may be relevant: Hiring and inequality in elite professional service firms (by Lauren Rivera). Your university library should be able to obtain a copy. I think it is one of the few sociological studies that actually measures what recruiters (in that tier of company) are actually looking for - as compared to what they say they are looking for. In general, partners and staff at the "elite" service firms look upon a high GPA as a proxy measure for "how meticulous" you are. Someone with a 4.0 would be perceived as "very meticulous" while someone with a 2.5 might be intelligent, might get the job done, but would be perceived as "careless". 

You cannot control what other people will say; you can only control what you do in response. Viktor Frankl put it: 

Generally, a "subject matter expert" is someone who knows the subject well enough to be writing books and teaching others. Many times, interviewers and recruiters ask you to rate your expertise on a scale of 1 to 10 - an SME would be a 10. Because USAJOBS is a US Federal Government jobs portal, I suspect that they're also looking for people who could satisfy the "expert witness" requirement in a Daubert hearing. 

I did this at a previous job and was dinged badly on my performance review one year for doing so. I was able to make some small and minor changes in our development process but those drove my boss crazy. That boss is trying to get me to come back and save their bacon, and of the folks who quit in the past 2 years (the other guys who quit had been there 10 +/- 2 years), some will never come back, one is already back and the boss is balking at trying to match what I'm making now. The new CEO has made some changes in policies - and these new policies have the potential to make things turn around. Simple things like a wiki (to keep track of developer knowledge) and setting up a build machine (to make builds repeatable) are well within the ability to do them as evenings and weekends projects and then present them as fait accompli. I had been there for 5 years and I was the short timer - everyone else had been there for 8-18 years. All of the business and domain knowledge was trapped in people's heads and there wasn't a way to store it to preserve it; when several key developers quit in the past 2 years , a huge amount of that knowledge was irretrievably lost. There are some studies on the conflict between status-seeking bosses and employees who want to help improve things, one of which is Reversing the Extroverted Leadership Advantage: the Role of Employee Proactivity. From the study:
