Brief answer (on tablet) When an oceanic plate is formed, the crust is hydrated by the hydrothermal vents systems at the ocean ridge where it forms (hydrated means that the minerals are altered to include water in their structure). When this crust is subducted in the ocean trenches around the Pacific, it is taken down towards the mantle; as these hydrated minerals heat up again, they release water. This water then lowers the melting point of the mantle above the descending plate, which melts to produce a basaltic/andesitic melt with a high water content - the water is dissolved in the magma. When this melt reaches the surface again, the high concentration of water leads to explosive eruptions as it comes out of solution. 

Pretty confident to answer No here. Tsunamis are caused by water displacement due to earthquakes; this has nothing to do with global warming. Any changes in density would be trivial, and although the water would have more thermal energy, this would not affect or be influenced by the kinetic energy of the Tsunami. The only way in which a tsunami would be made more severe would be that any sea level rise due to global warming would be added to the Tsunami height. 

It shows a pattern where the temperatures are dramatically lower where ice sheets have built up relative to today. Interestingly, a lower overall temperature means weaker mixing across latitudes, so some areas are actually warmer. Boston gets chilled by -20 according to the map. Also note the altitude effect. If the surface is raised by 1 kilometer, then due to the lapse rate, the temperature at the new surface will drop by 6.5 degrees. This is a very important factor in stabilizing large ice sheets. 

Alternative 2 The spatial dimensions and corresponding variables exist in the source file but are not denoted as and . Then each data variable (SST, in this example) needs to have an attribute that holds the names of the coordinate variables. 

TLDR; The precipitation values (and possibly some other variables; see below) need to be divided by 24.

Now, we extract time and space slices again (figure below). Green and blue indicate the slices, again. Here we see that the space-slice will be much easier/faster to extract then before. However, the extraction of the time slice will take more time.

Geology Geology deals with the solid Earth below our feet: composition of rocks, dating of rocks, plate tectonics, identifying natural resources below the ground. It might also deal with the composition of the solid part of other planets - but I am not sure about that. Physical Geography Phyical geography deals with the planet as a whole, including atmosphere, oceans, ground water, and partly 'what is living on the planet'. Climate modeling can also be considered as a part of physical geography. Summary Thus, phyiscal geography is broader than geology when it comes to the Earth surface and consideres also the compartments air and water. In contrast, geology goes deeper into the Earth. From my feeling, geology is more focussed on the past/history of the Earth, whereas physical geography is more about understanding what is happing now and what will happen in future. 

If hydrocarbons were primordial, then we would expect to find them mostly in areas where the mantle or mantle taps reach the surface - mid ocean ridges, and ocean island volcanoes. We don't. The major oil fields are located in continental extensional basin settings. There is plenty of evidence for mantle outgassing - including all volatile species such as hydrocarbons - in the first few hundred million years. Furthermore, on geological timescales the mantle is still undergoing vigorous convection and can be considered liquid. Is irrelevant. This is simply wrong, if referring to pores that can offer any support against pressure. The crust becomes ductile at about 10-15km, and the mantle at 60+km, meaning that conventional porosity cannot exist. See (1). For the Earth, outgassing was essentially completed billions of years ago, as we can see from isotopic evidence (and I suspect that the moon-forming impact didn't help). 

What you have probably seen in the movies, as used by the oil and gas industry is reflection seismology. This is where you shoot off a sound source (explosives, airguns, etc) and track the reflections of the sound waves from the various rock layers below the surface. At a smaller scale, there is Ground Penetrating Radar, good for a few 10s of meters at best, which is higher resolution and good for detecting voids. 

Well, one way would be to look through The rock forming minerals and see how many are represented. I strongly suspect that not all would be, so from that perspective the answer would be No. But from an inspection perspective.. For any given mineral structure, we can make changes by simply substituting various cations and anions as in pyroxene; for example, we can substitute Mg(2+) for Fe(2+). Or SiO4(4-) for AlO4(5-) - requiring other changes. So, assuming you had suitable equipment, you could find a naturally occurring crystal that was close to the desired symmetry group and tweak it with substitutions until it matched that group. Or more simply, adjust the pressure and temperature until the symmetry changed. There is a lot of phase space to explore. So from that perspective, the answer would be probably yes, we just haven't synthesized them all yet. 

What does 'nitrogen' mean? Nitrogen might mean gaseous $N_2$. It might also mean compounds, which contain nitrogen, such as nitrate, ammonia and ammonium. $N_2$ $N_2$ cannot be metabolized by most plants because it is to inert. You need bacteria or plants (e.g. Legume family plants) to perform nitrogen fixation. During this processes the $N_2$ is converted into bio-available compounds such as ammonia. If these plants/bacteria are not present, the $N_2$ is useless and does not increase the fertility. Nitrate and Ammonium/Ammonium Ammonium and nitrate can directly be 'used' by plants and soil bacteria. Therefore, if we provide these compounds, we increase the fertility. Summary Generally, 'nitrogen' does not increase the fertility of soils but depends on how it is bound - elemental or in a bio-available form. Therefore, 'nitrogen' does not necessarily increase the fertility. In contrast, nitrogen fixing bacteria do increase the fertility of the soil (also long as $N_2$ concentrations in the atmosphere are as high as present). 

General Information One major operational system for the measurement of deep sea temperature, salinity and pressure is the Argo program. Individual Argo floats are distributed in the worlds oceans. Their measurement data are scientifically evaluated and are available for public download. Additionally, several research institutions own gliders. However, I am not sure if they are also used operational for deep sea measurements. Argo floats Argo floats are large submerged buoys. They are made for profiling the top 2000 m of the world's oceans. The common depth of an Argo floater is approximately 1000 m. Approximately in 10-day intervals they sink to 2000 m depth and afterwards rise to the sea surface, from where broadcast their position and measurement data. Currently, more than 1000 Argo floats are active in the worlds oceans. The official Argo homepage is here. Here you find a more detailed description of the function of Argo drifters and here you can download drifter measurements. Gliders Gliders are one tool for measuring temperature and salinity on vertical transects (actually not a purely vertical transect). Some gliders can go below 1000 m. The disadvantage of a glider is that it needs considerable horizontal space available straight ahead of his direction of motion. A nice explanation and applications are given here and here. This is the homepage of the global scientific glider community. 

Quick and simple answer: A greater greenhouse effect. There is an equilibrium in place. CO2 weathering rates depend on temperature, so at lower temperatures, we see CO2 levels rise, warming the planet. At higher temperatures, higher weathering rates mean more CO 2 drawdown, so the planet cools. This is a very long term process. But this CO2 thermometer effect is believed to be the reason why we have had liquid oceans for all of known earth history. As far as the black body effect goes; this is correct - from the viewpoint of an observer at distance, Earth would 'appear' colder. However, this is because the emission height changes (see $URL$ ) for more of an explanation. Think of it as 'the height at which the atmosphere becomes IR-opaque' (although this is a simplification); the temperature then follows the lapse rate down to the ground. So raising the emission height raises the surface temperature. (NB late at night, add refs later..) 

You need to define what you mean by 'adding more sun'. I'm asuming you mean 'increase the solar constant'. The amount of water vapour in the air is, as a first order approximation, related to temperature - every degree of temperature rise gives us 7% more water vapour. So if 'adding more sun' increases the temperature then it automatically increases water vapour. Now, to add more sun without increasing the temperature, you'd have to compensate by doing something like painting large areas of land white; this would increase the Earth's albedo, reflecting the extra solar radiation. No temperature change overall, so no water vapor change. The only direct effect of the sun on water vapor is something entirely different - through photo-dissociation. This is where the sun's UV rays directly break up water molecules. However, in order to have an appreciable effect on the day to day concentration of water vapour, you'd need to replace the Sun with a much bigger and hotter star that blasted out far more UV radiation. The problem here is that everyone would die. So as far as the question can be answered, it would be no under any realistic scenario. 

Where to find the data The German Climate Research Center (DKRZ, Deutsches Klimarechenzentrum) hosts the Word Data Center for Climate (WDCC). You can search the WDCC via the CERA Database (cera-www.dkrz.de). Looking for ECHAM provides you with several sets of ECHAM model results: here. You get at least the ECHAM data for the second to fourth IPCC assessment reports and some more data sets. You need to have a login. It can be easily created. Information on the structure of the data at CERA You have projects, experiments, and data (sets). Projects contain overall information on the model setup, on the data producers, and on the validation. One experiment can summarize several data sets. For a coupled climate model this could mean, that the physical ocean, the biogeochemical ocean, the meteorology, and the atmospheric chemistry are saved as individual data sets, which are than summarized as one experiment. Experiments can have a doi (digital object identifier). Thus, they are easily citeable in scientific publications and long-term available. Access data at the WDCC You can directly download data via the web-interface. As an alternative, you can use jblob, which is a command line utility for downloading data from the WDCC. Jblob also has some options to pre-process data on the DKRZ servers prior to download it -- which might reduce your file size. For both access pathways you need to have a valid login. 

Actually quite interesting. Oxygen is made by the splitting of water, either by photosynthesis or by UV-based photo-dissociation in the upper atmosphere. In the case of photosynthesis, the reduced-carbon products must be buried in order for a net accumulation of oxygen to happen. In this case the oxygen effectively comes from water: (1) 2H2O + vis. light. -> 2H2 + O2 (Water to hydrogen and oxygen) (2) 2H2 + CO2 -> H2CO + H2O (Carbon dioxide and Hydrogen to carbohydrate and water. Carbohydrate is buried) And from UV-dissociation, we get (1) 2H2O + uv -> 2H2 + O2 (Water to hydrogen and oxygen, hydrogen is lost to space) The oceans weight over 10^21kg, most of which is oxygen, so there is plenty of mass there. Edit: Methane Photodissociation The reaction is effectively (in an oxygen free atmosphere): (3) CH4 + 2H2O + uv -> CO2 + 4H2 (lost to space) Note that without hydrogen loss to space, there is a limit on the amount of oxygenation that can happen, because the reduced carbon generated in photosynthesis has to be buried geologically. Estimates for the amount of buried reduced carbon are hard to find (carbonates don't count for this purpose). So the ultimate source of oxygen in the atmosphere would appear to be water, mostly. 

I can't see there being any physical cause - the water depths are too great for an ice mountain and the feature cross-cuts other geological features. Plus, it's not aligned with either the spreading axis of the mid Atlantic ridge or normal to it. That means that it is highly unlikely to be a fault or a hotspot track. Given that, some sort of processing artifact seems most likely. 

Note: If the coordinate variables are missing, then they can be created via the operator. If we want to add a grid definition to the source file then we need the source file's grid definition in the text file (see 'define grid'). 

is a text file. interpolate data I assume that we do a bilinear interpolation. This is done with the operator via: 

Species that impact visibility We 'need' the gaseous air pollutants to form secondary aerosol particles. The reduced visibility during winter and summer smog events is caused by these secondary aerosol particles (they scatter the light and, by this process, reduce visibility). The gaseous air pollutants might contribute to reduced visibility but their contribution is negligible compared to the aerosol impact. Contribution of different aerosol species The composition as well as the size distribution of the aerosol particles is important to determine the aerosol's optical properties. If you look into mass concentrations, a given mass of fine particles extincts more light than the same mass of coarse particles. If you look into composition (inorganic components), nitrate extincts more light than sea salt and sulfate. The extinction of organic aerosol depends on their composition (I have no idea which factors/species are relevant there). If you are interested in further literature on the impact of the particle composition on the light extinction you might look into Pitchford et al. (2007). I didn't find a publication which quantifies the contribution of different particulate compositions/species to light extinction for smog. However, Pitchford et al. (2007) deals with light extinction for calculating the optical thickness from model data.
