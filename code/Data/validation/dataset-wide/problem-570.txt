Personally, I just wear boots, and use toe clips or bare platforms depending on the size of the boots. 

As well as references to entire books on rubber and the process of vulcanization: 'Rubber Technology, edited by Maurice Morton, Chapter 2, "The Compounding and Vulcanization of Rubber," 3rd edition, 1987' None of these appears to have any kind of description of a single readily available material or combination of a few that could be mixed together to work; they all appear to be fairly intricate, specialized compounds consisting of a variety of ingredients. So I think that the 8oz can on Amazon is probably your best bet. I've heard some people claim you can just use regular rubber cement, but given that there are big cans of the "vulcanizing solution" readily available, my instinct would be to go for that. 

I have a brand new Titanium Boost 29er hardtail. The frame uses a PF30 BB and the BB shell is 73mm wide. I have installed the recommended RaceFace cinch PF30 bottom bracket with a Race face Next SL crank - 175mm arms and 32t single chain-ring. The problem is that the clearance between the chain stay and the crank arm is next to nothing. There is no contact yet but I am unable to run the recommended crank boot protector. 

Interesting and personal topic. I'll ignore your budget for now... Ok i make use of a Garmin Edge 1000 with a HR monitor. I like to monitor my HR by % of max rather than beats. Makes it easier when looking at zones thinking of it in %. For a indoor training on Zwift i use the Wahoo Kickr you refer to above. Now here it records in beats since thats what Zwift shows but whats good here is it supports Bluetooth and ANT+ Different tools for different applications. On the bike Polar works fine easy enough to upload and you can see tour zones, HR in beats or %. Garment n provides a few more options like routing, HR graph even these days on the edge 1000 and 520s. Coming back to your budget... The Wahoo kickr is a simple cheap option to use with your phone if you only using Strava. If your using other apps like Garmin connect, Polar etc a dedicated monitor and strap has more advantages. But you pay for those advantages. I guess flexibility and compatibility are the major things to consider. 

Run.GPS is mentioned in the list of apps supporting the Zephyr heart rate monitor. I haven't tried it; anyone who has, feel free to comment or edit this answer with more information. 

I know I should lubricate my chain regularly. I got some lube at my LBS; how should I apply it? Do I just drip some on one spot, and turn the pedals around a few times to spread it out? Drip it all over the chain? Do I clean the chain first? How can I tell if it needs lube, or if I've put enough on? 

My commute takes me along a fairly busy road, with 4 lanes of traffic and parked cars along most of it. There are no bike lanes, but in some places, it's wide enough that I can easily pass traffic on the right (which is legal in my state, as far as I can tell), and in some places, there's actually a whole extra lane on the right for a block or two. However, the conditions change from block to block. On some of the blocks, there is not enough room to pass safely on the right of cars, and there are some places where the extra lane on the right no longer exists across the intersection or is filled with parked cars. There are several times when I've passed cars on the right, either in a full lane or in the room between a lane of stopped cars and parked cars, and then realized after crossing through the next intersection that I need to merge back into the next lane. What is the etiquette of merging back into the next lane in such circumstances? There are a few possibilities that I've tried, and all of them seem unsatisfying in certain ways. 

Honestly i have 2 of what you describe with a few variations - for gearing you don't need more than 2X11. Light i would consider looking at a dynamo hub like SON 28. Rear rack look at Thule, bike pannier rack (use to be called Freeload). Suspension and dropper post these days come almost standard on most bikes and you don't need to go spend $7k plus to get one either. I would buy an out of the box bike and change that you want to change by sourcing parts from Chain Reaction Cycle or get your local bike shop to custom build you one. 

I have an Android smartphone, with GPS, accelerometer, 3G internet connection, and other features that seem useful for bicycling. Are there any good bicycling apps on Android? One app per answer please; feel free to answer multiple times. 

The manufacturer sells said "vulcanizing solution" in quantities of 25g tubes through 1 gallon cans, so you should be able to buy it in larger quantities. Indeed, a quick search of Amazon yield 8 oz cans (or slightly cheaper), and while I couldn't find it on something well known like Amazon there are other places that sell the 1 gallon quantity. However, as many of the reviewers on Amazon point out, an 8 oz can should be a lifetime supply, and won't dry up nearly as quickly as those little tubes. As far as what it is, that's a little harder to figure out. Checking the MSDS, we find only that it consists of 40-70% trichloroethelyne, an organic solvent. That doesn't really solve the problem, as that's just the solvent used. To address the question of rubber cement, if we follow your link to Wikipedia, we find that it's generally a non-vulcanizing cement, while the tire patch stuff definitely claims to be vulcanizing. Moving on, we can think about what the traditional solution to closely held trade secret formulas is. And the tool that was designed to solve that, though only does so imperfectly, is the patent system. Maybe we can find something in a patent filing. A quick check over on Google Patents yields something promising, Cold self-vulcanizing rubber compositions; however, upon reading the patent, it's a three part mixture, and the process involves things like "the rubber used is a natural rubber, partially depolymerized by mechanical working and peptization with diorthobenzamidophenyl." I don't know about you, but peptization with diorthobenzamidophenyl is not exactly something I feel like trying to cook up with common household substances in my basement. Reading further on, we find some further promising patents like Tire repair with cured patch or Tire repair by "patch only" method, but they all also involve discussions of the following form: 

I think that will be okay. Have a look if there are no spacers behind the rotor mount bolts - or if it's center lock see if there is a spacer behind it as well. Removing these may help. 

I have a bike which had a RS1 fork and a wheel with a required predictive steering hub. I have a second bike which has a Boost 110 front fork. Since both these hubs are 110mm wide, can I use the wheel with the predictive steering hub on the Boost 110 fork? I know it does not work the other way around since the RS1 fork does require the predictive hub. 

Continue to travel in the lane that will run out until it actually does, then stop and wait for a gap in the traffic before merging in. That can sometimes require stopping and waiting for quite a while, due to busy traffic. Signal to the left in advance of running out of the lane, check for a reasonable gap in the cars while still moving, and merge into that gap once I've determined it's safe, or fall back to the first option if that doesn't work. The problem is, this requires a good deal of judgement to tell when there's a good enough gap in traffic to merge back in, I can only glance back quickly and not make good eye contact with drivers in the lane I'm merging into since I need to be paying attention to what's ahead of me as well, and I'm not sure if I'm cutting people off too closely. Pass the cars on the right, then pull up in front of them at a stop light so I can take the lane when it turns green. This makes me feel like a jerk, like I'm cutting in line. Simply stay in, and take, the lane that doesn't keep disappearing. This is what I would do if I were driving a car. The problems are that I get stuck in stop-and-go traffic which slows me down, I have to breathe in the smog of trucks and busses in front of me as I wait, and I hold up somewhat more traffic as I don't take several of the block-long opportunities to make it easy for cars to pass me. Run red lights. This way, I can actually get into the lane I need to before I have to contend with cars. The disadvantage is, of course, that I'm running red lights. 

I can say from experience this does not work well at all. Although as mentioned above the chain does run through the shifting is dreadful. I tried it with a 10 speed shifter but gears would always have a spot where they would jump. Just get a 10 speed rear derailleur. You will be glad you did. 

If chain us not slipping then id say you have a busted freehub by the sound of it. Take the cassette off, remove the freehub inspect the paws check for excess grease or lack of. Otherwise look at a new freehub body. I had the same issue you describe last week. 

I haven't tried it myself, but according to the quite informative ICEBIKE website, sandals with layers of socks, including breathable waterproof ones, works quite well. 

VeloComputer appears to be an attempt at turning a phone into a complete cycling computer. Version 7, which is available for Android, uses GPS for measuring position and speed, and the accelerometer to measure cadence. They also sell Bluetooth enabled wheel and pedal sensors, for more accurate speed and cadence, though those seem to only be supported on Blackberry at the moment. I have not tried this; it looks interesting, though some of the reviews indicate that it's a bit flaky. Does anyone else have experience with it?
