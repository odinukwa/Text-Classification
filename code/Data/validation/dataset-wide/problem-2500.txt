To the first question, to go or not to go is a personal decision. Some may find little investigation in advance is necessary while others may need or desire awareness sufficient to overcome fears, uncertainty, or doubt. Others still may simply need enough facts to weigh cost/benefit or risk/reward. These value judgments are ultimately the responsibility of the interested person. You may share your experience, strength, and hope with those that welcome such. After which, your duty is exhausted. You may also share your fears, uncertainty, and doubt with others, if such is welcomed. However, ultimately the choice to act or not to act is upon them. And subsequently, their experience is their experience. To all those for whom you are not a teacher (that have not inquired or welcomed your guidance), you are imposing your values upon them. Such an act is proselytizing and the subject to an entirely different question. To the title question... 

As to gains, your premise begins with a fallacy -- that, "gains" (or progress, development, cultivation) are dependent on linearity. This premise does not withstand scrutiny because it presumes to the singular; that gains are not gains if they are do not fall within a specific succession of measurable intervals. Additionally, in this context forward and backward are value judgments. If we suspend judgment then "backwards" simply indicates gain of a different sort, which is entirely possible. However, it can not be substantiated that lack of effort results in regression (negative gains) simply because gains are correlated to effort. It is far more reasonable to assert that effort results in gain and non-effort results in non-gain. 

While your question appears rational, I will argue that it is not and conclude with an answer to the spirit of your question based on canonical sources. Your question is presented in two clauses. Therefore: First, I believe it is critical to suffer through a deconstruction of your reasoning. Second, as meditation is ill-defined here, this answer will presume the broadest non-technique specific definition inclusive of samatha and vipassana. Third, as I believe you have been exposed to a teaching out of context, I will attempt to rein in the exuberance of composition present in your question with some doctrine. 

What you have heard is not unreasonable. It is a teaching that desperately needs context. Linearity is a rational property (relationship or function) that represents directional succession of measurable intervals. Linearity is a concept present in math, art, science, logic, and music. In the broadest sense, for linearity to be rational, there must exist one of two conditions: 1) an origin and a destination or 2) an origin and a directional vector. In order for linearity to be captured or shared in any meaningful or actionable way, there must be rational measurement. Briefly, as to origin, it is generally safe to presume for argumentation in this context that the origin is the you of now. But this is not as trivial as it may appear. Because the you of now is not the same you of the now just a moment ago when you began this paragraph. "Is this you of the now more or less informed than a hypothetical you at another now?" Put another way, "How are the things unknown to you different now than at any other moment?" Or in the form of a koan, "What do I not know?" You are not static and thus neither is you as an origin. The now shatters the illusory origin and makes both destinations and vectors equally fantastic. All we have is now. There is also the notion that linearity is singular; that is, it cannot represent multiple measurements or states simultaneously. And briefly stipulating to quantum mechanics, it is certainly possible to argue the possibility of infinite, omni-directional linearity, but then if one has reached such a conclusion, such infinite linearity, when aggregated to now, is self-canceling; such that, linearity is again moot. 

The Path of Purification, Visuddhimagga 88-109 So, in conclusion, speaking to the spirit of your question: Cultivation and practice is both sufficient and necessary to (using your word) "make gains". Lack of effort may be a sufficient condition for unrisen unwholesomeness, but it is not a necessary condition. Can one lose or forget what one has learned? Certainly. But one may just as easily forget to apply/practice what one has learned without losing the learning. If one is judging outcomes, meditate on the difference between not knowledge and practice. 

"Being Nobody, Going Nowhere: The Foundation of Buddhist Thought", Volume 3, By Geshe Tashi Tsering, Ayya Khema 

To me that bears a striking resemblance to instructions for Buddhist meditation. The main difference -- the idea of God -- is a difference only if, as I say, you take very literally the typical anthropomorphic view of "God". But if you see past that -- and surely whatever God is, if indeed God "is", then "he" is certainly not an old white dude with a long beard sitting up in the clouds -- my view is that there is often actually very little difference between Buddhist prayer and Christian prayer. This is, of course, a minority view! (Which doesn't, on the other hand, make it wrong.) 

Does praying in Buddhism have a different meaning or purpose as compared with religions with a creator God? There are various points of view, depending substantially on the intent or state of mind of the person praying. I'll give you three of those points of view (POVs) From the POV of the typical Christian, it absolutely has a different meaning. For example, in Catholic Christianity, prayer is "the uplifting of the heart and mind to God" (from the Catechism). Prayers are typically done to, through and "in the name of" Jesus, one of the three "persons" in the single tri-une God. God -- the personal, omnipresent, omniscient, omnipotent, omnibenevolent creator of everything -- is front and center of Christian prayer. If God is not front and center then best case it's not prayer, and worst case it may even be seen as downright dangerous and at risk from the influence of evil spirits. The primary purpose of Christian prayer is to bring the creature into union with the Creator (worship, praise, and also intercession are all components in that). From the POV of the typical praying Buddhist, there is no such "fully featured" God, so again the meaning is clearly different. A common purpose is, as with meditation (which is very like, although not identical to, some contemplative forms of prayer), to help train the mind as part of the path to enlightenment. However, finally, from my POV, I think it is hard to overlook the marked similarities between Christian prayer and Buddhist prayer and meditation, if you see past the difference created by the (excessive) anthropomorphizing of the concept of God. For example, the first time I participated in a chanting session in a Zen center, I was struck by how similar it felt to the many times in my childhood when I attended a Catholic Rosary service. Many Catholics, especially post Vatican 2, have tried to stress the importance of saying prayers in one's own language and in understanding and meaning the actual words. But via Zen, I came to see the value in the almost mantra-like quality of the high-speed Rosary, and of prayers and hymns in languages other than my own. This Latin, for example, is beautiful to my ears, and spiritually uplifting: $URL$ For another example, look at this extract from the Eighth Letter in the 17th Century "The Practice of the Presence of God" by Brother Lawrence of the Resurrection: 

All that said, I'd find it hard to impossible to say just how much of the above theoretically possible harm is experienced in practice. I'd guess (but based on my reading of Ingram, Britton, and also Shinzen Young and others) that the third point is rare. 

Gosh, that's a heavy question. All I'll do is point you to some potentially useful material. I suggest you take a look at comparisons between the philosophy of Wittgenstein, and that of Nagarjuna. (Professional analytic philosophers may be knee-jerking like crazy here, but I'll persist.) The central idea that connects them -- if anything does -- is the idea that what you are asking sits outside the bounds of what language can express. It -- the notion of more or less "real"-ness -- is an example of what Wittgenstein referred to in stating "Whereof one cannot speak, thereon one must remain silent." Or, less exotically, I really do think that the movie "The Matrix" has something to offer here. When Neo asks Morpheus, inside the battle simulation, "So this isn't real?", Morpheus replies "What is real?" Put another way, why are you distinguishing between "virtual" reality, and "real" reality? Ultimately we have no idea what is "out there"; the only thing we do know for sure is that we are perceiving it. I don't know if that is of any use whatsoever :-) 

I recommend Sam Harris's "Waking Up" for a decent discussion of this topic in general, and of Poonja (Papaji) specifically. The relevant part of the book is Chapter 4 "Meditation", specifically starting on page 127 (hardback). Based on Harris's account, which is both respectful of Poonja but also healthily avoids being overly credulous, I'd say that the answers to your questions are:
