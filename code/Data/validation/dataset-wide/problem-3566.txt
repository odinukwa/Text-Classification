This kind of extreme weight loss program, as Larissa mentions, will have a negative impact on your body, and additionally will not be very sustainable. Based on your weight, and your description of your body, a far better path to achieve your goals will be starting a weightlifting program with a controlled diet. While your main goal may be a flat stomach, you'll find that you see the greatest improvements with lifts that incorporate many muscles, such as deadlifts, squats, or bench press. I won't outline a weightlifting plan here since you didn't ask for one, but know that these sorts of exercises will lead you to the results you seek. If you definitely need to lose weight, then keep your diet at a normal level as you begin to exercise; the deficit created by working out will lead to lost weight. I'd recommend, however, with your weight, that the best strategy would be to eat a little bit more, add some protein to your diet, and focus on muscle gains, as these will bring you closer to the body I think you're looking for than pure weight loss will. As a side note, you may have a normal amount of fat on your but just lack muscle underneath. Web MD offers a good summary of the role of stomach fat and explains how everyone has fat there to some degree. If you're in this situation, weightlifting is definitely the strategy to follow :) 

If you've seen benefits from it, keep doing it. Regardless of how it compares to other sorts of exercises, if it is working for you, then it is most definitely "valuable exercise". The only point I could attempt to make in support of your friend would be to say that running in place likely will not be as beneficial if you're trying to build up endurance directly applicable to running races, but in terms of general fitness you certainly are not cheating. As to where she might get the idea of cheating, I would say its because of what you said yourself, that running in place is "obviously less exercise". If you stick with the hard number of 10,000, then 10,000 steps of running in place will not equal 10,000 steps of running forward. She likely doesn't want you to think that you've done the equivalent of 10,000 steps forward, as in reality you have not. In short, keep doing your running in place, and continue to enjoy the benefits of it. Tell your friend that you're aware running in place is different than running forward, but that its beneficial for you; I would think as a fitness fanatic she would appreciate that people do what works for them. 

As baldy mentioned, this really comes down to what you feel comfortable with. If you feel fine exercising with food in your stomach, then exercise right after dinner if that works best for you, as you will enjoy the same benefits. The reality is, however, that most people aren't able to exercise at full capacity right after eating. The guidelines the Mayo Clinic sets are 

If you enjoy coconut water, feel free to drink it after your workout. It's a nice post-workout snack, as are drinks like Gatorade and Powerade, but these can all be substituted with a small meal instead. From your description of your fatigue, it sounds like a small meal would better suit your needs. There's a wide variety of options; I'm partial to a protein drink and a small bowl of pasta, but more oats could work, or energy bars, etc. If you can hold them down alright while working out, try them out and see if you feel better. Unless you're working out for substantially longer than your described workout the benefits won't hit in time, but you may find a sort of placebo effect kicks in when you eat. Generally it won't matter if you wait until after your workout though. A protein supplement will be best to take in proximity to your workout, but make sure you are also eating enough protein from others foods throughout the next day, to further aid your body in recovering. Depending on your diet, you may find it useful to drink another protein shake the next day to make sure you're meeting your requirements. You need to eat. As I mentioned in part 1, a small meal will be a great help in preventing your fatigue, although you'll always have a certain degree of fatigue after a tough workout. 

Based on your times, I'd recommend moving your goal to 1:40 per lap, and then go no faster than 1:38 on any lap. The idea of shooting for a specific time works because as you get tired, you still have that goal in mind, and can work harder to reach it for each interval. You start out well under your goal on July 30th, but even by the 3rd interval you're missing your splits. This type of pattern can lead to an acceptance of slower times on later repetitions, which makes it difficult to push yourself and get faster. By keeping your splits all at a constant pace, you'll have a better idea of how hard you need to go on the later intervals, and can adjust accordingly, rather than simply going at a pace which feels doable. You should also try to bring down your times more on the last 1-2 intervals, when the workout is close to being over. Shoot for a 5th interval at least as fast as any previous interval, and then shoot to beat that time on the 6th. These are the pieces you should be pushing on, not the 1st and 2nd ones. The last lap especially should be significantly faster; practicing this speed increase at the end will help to give you confidence in your overall endurance. 

It looks like you were dehydrated when you stopped exercising, and then regained that water weight over the two weeks. It would have required an enormous calorie surplus to gain back all that weight as fat, and unless you dramatically changed your eating habits, this would not be the case. What this means is that the muscle you gained from your workouts added up to roughly the amount you lost in fat; the good news is that this change is a great one to undergo. As you continue to work out, make sure to maintain a constant state of hydration; this will allow you to learn more from looking at the scale. While fully hydrated, if the scale shows a lower number, you will know that represents fat you lost, rather than simply lost water. As I mentioned, it looks like you didn't lose a great deal of weight over those 3 months, as your lost fat was replaced with muscle. This situation will be remedied naturally as you continue to work out; your body will stop building muscle at such a quick rate, and your weight will begin to drop more from the exercise. You've been doing great to keep up this routine, don't let your setback get to you. It looks like you've got a great mindset, and that will take you far in your weight loss journey. 

So this question comes as I lie in bed, legs aching, incapable of falling asleep. I worked out in the evening today since I couldn't get to the gym in the morning, and had a successful deadlift and squat session. My legs still hurt, however, and it's noticeable enough that I can't get comfortable in bed. Any suggestions for how to get to sleep after an evening workout? 

In addition to these sorts of foods for protein, incorporate grains into your meals for the carbs, and you can include fruits and vegetables for their nutritional benefits. Regarding when to eat these foods, it really depends on what works for you. If your stomach is comfortable with you eating before a workout, that works fine; generally, however, it works best to keep the meal before a workout light, and then consume more protein after. If you're working out at 5pm, this might mean eating a larger lunch and then nothing until after your workout; if you're working out at 2pm, you could eat a light lunch then an early dinner after. The important thing will be to be working out and consuming the right amounts of protein and carbs; the timing is of significantly less importance. Working out in the morning can be a great way to kick off the day, but in terms of whether its best for you, it again depends on what you're comfortable with. If you have enough energy in the morning to hit your numbers and work out with intensity, then go for it; if you're dragging yourself to the gym and performing a sluggish workout, it might be best to wait until the afternoon. The effective workout is what's important, not the timing of it. In addition, sleep is also important, so if workout out early will impact your sleep, it'd be best to wait until later.
