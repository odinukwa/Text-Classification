If you have horizontal drop-outs, you might also have threaded holes for "drop-out adjustment screws". These are M3 screws held in place with firm springs that allow you to finely adjust exactly where in the drop-out the rear axle rests. If you have adjustment screws set-up right, you can be assured that the rear wheel is straight by merely yanking it backwards with some force before tightening the quick-release. As others have indicated you judge the placement of the wheel by comparing the gap between the tire and the left/right chainstays. 

I've gone through a lot of gloves over the years and have to say that effective cycling gloves for cold weather are a really hard problem. No one glove can work for all of the cold temperature ranges. That is why Neil has several. As Neil said, wind is your enemy. This is more insidious than it seems at first because it means that you need gloves that block the cold air, but if they block the cold air, it means that they're also holding in moisture. Over time your sweat will make you miserable and give you cold hands no matter what you're wearing. The right gloves or combination of gloves will keep your hands warm but no so warm that they sweat too much. This is a tricky balance that is impossible to achieve with only one pair over a wide cold temperature range. 

The most practical solution I've found is to buy sports drinks in powdered form and mix them before the ride. This makes it easy to consistently dial-in the right amount of dilution (can't stand the stuff "straight"). Powdered gatorade has worked fine for me. YMMV. I think that creating a sports drink from scratch would be too much of a "science project"! 

At the risk of sounding snarky, I just want to add one thing to the otherwise excellent advice in the answers: motivation. Safety considerations aside, you don't really need any accessory to commute in bad weather. It is more a matter of how much discomfort you're willing to tolerate. "The gear" is not what is holding you back. Sure you can go all out and get full fenders with mud-flaps, waterproof panniers, appropriate lights, a cycling specific rain poncho, exactly the right gloves, splats, rain-pants, shoe covers, full-chain-guard, wax lubricant, seat protector, etc, etc. But what would that get you? You'll still get wet or sweaty and you'll have to maintain all this stuff not to mention lug it around-- or risk finding yourself leavinng work during a thunderstorm with all your rain-day-stuff safe and dry at home. My advice is to get fenders/lights to start with, then just make a commitment to commute in the rain. Eventually, as a result of an extremely uncomfortable commute, you might consider adding a thing or two beyond that and make carefully considered adjustments according to temperature, distance, speed, and portability. Generally speaking, you're more likely to stick to it if you do it no matter what with the expectation of a modicum of misery and discomfort. 

Having restored a number of old cheap bikes, I can tell you that the biggest problem is almost never the derailleurs/shifters. Usually these bikes have not been ridden much and have spent most of their time in a garage exposed to the elements. The biggest problems are rusted parts, poor lubrication, and horrifically bad tuning. Frequently, on a bike like this you're likely to find that it was never properly put together. Here's a quick checklist of things to go over that can be fixed economically: 

I understand what you're trying to do but why is it important? You're concerned about the amount of drag you get from the freewheel when you're coasting, this can't be very much. If the drag is so bad that when you push the bike by hand the pedals turn then I'd say something is very wrong. But if you're just feeling some small amount of drag that's OK. Why? because when you're coasting, you probably don't care if you have little bit of drag in the hub and you're probably going downhill anyway. The freewheel does its job when the pawls inside are locked with the hub, when the pawls are disengaged and you're coasting, you just have some slight friction from metal-oil-metal with no significant loading. This is why Sheldon Brown says it is not worth it to service the freewheel. Just buy a new or a NOS (new old stock) freewheel. Loosescrews is a good source for basic stuff. You might also be able to find a high-quality NOS Regina from the 70's or 80's (that might be worth servicing). 

I think the best approach here is one of convention rather than the physics of color sensitivity, in other words, consideration for what makes the most sense to an approaching driver. In north america, "slow moving vehicles" (such as farm tractors and Amish buggies) use an orange triangle with a red border. The point of such markings is to communicate to the driver what is front of them with as little cognitive load as possible. With orange, you more clearly convey "slow moving vehicle" or maybe "traffic cone". With yellow, the driver might have to have to think about whether that yellow blob ahead is a cyclist or traffic sign. That said, it doesn't matter too much. The important thing is to have significant contrast with the rest of the environment. One side-issue to keep in mind is that the time when visibility is most degraded is NOT at night. The worst time for visibility is at dawn or dusk, when there is enough light to "see" everything, but not enough light for good visual contrast between things on/near the road. For this reason, your most important safety device is a nice bright rear light. 

300 miles a week is extremely high mileage. Very few people can pull that off. I'm surprised that you feel you need to ask for advice. :-) That said the way the cyclists increase speed, like runners and swimmers, is to train with intervals. This means increasing your speed until you're at/near/slightly-above lactate threshold, holding it for a minute or two, then resting for short time and repeating this multiple times. The bottom line is that this is a matter of following a training program. At 300mi/week you definitely have the "base" down (far more than most folks), now you just have to practice intervals/speed-work. 

The gradient and length of your hill will influence how you handle it. Generally speaking it is good to maintain your momentum for as long as you can. Standing up is fine if you're intending to power up a short hill. If you're in it for a long slog, it is good to stay seated, put your hands on the flats, breath deeply and keep the upper body as relaxed as possible. Occasionally stand up and mash to break the monotony or force your cadence higher but you'll waste energy if you do it too much. It certainly is possible to be in too low of a gear (especially on a triple like you have). If you're spinning quickly and the steering is slightly wobbly, your gear is too low and you should try something higher and go faster. 

This has nothing to do with fixies except perhaps that people on fixies tend to awkwardly power through obstacles without unloading enough weight at the right instant in time. There is junk you can inject into your tubes, but that stuff is terrible and increases rotating weight. You don't need it. Also, this has nothing to do with tire quality. Your rim is pinching the inner tube, not something from the outside the tire. Suggest you increase pressure on tires and avoid potholes. If that fails to work, try fatter tires. It is OK to go beyond the pressure specified on sidewall. 

There certainly are tapes and gloves that help decrease road shock transmitted to the hands. The traditional cinelli cork tape is a bit too hard if you're sensitive to that. Bontrager makes a nice gel tape. I use it, but honestly I don't think it makes a whole lot of difference. IMHO, the core issue might not be one of sufficient padding at all. It could be your position on the bike, bike geometry, your back muscles and ultimately how much weight you're putting on the hands. Certainly give some new tape a try. If that does not work, I'd recommend having a fitting session with a professional so you can find your optimal position and bike-geometry. 

I think that advocacy organizations absolutely must operate at very local, municipal scales. Why? because every town is different and has its own unique physical, legislative, and cultural landscape. Some places struggle simply with basic acceptance of the concept of a bicycle on the road, others are concerned with expansion of sharrows/lanes/signage/parking dedicated to bikes, others still are implementing bike-sharing systems. I think in many towns you'll find the following categories of advocacy groups. Some are more active than others, but all of them contribute in some way to better cycling in general. These organizations are the ones that are doing the nitty-gritty work in the towns in which they operate. I am taking the word "political" somewhat loosely, some of these groups directly interface with governments, others work indirectly by influencing public perception or working towards specific causes which is perhaps even MORE critical to success in the long term than government interaction. 

Here's the difference between a track bike and a road bike in terms of geometry. What this translates to in terms of handling will take some writing... Track bike geom (Bianchi super pista) 

A protective covering is useful on the chainstay if it is prone to frequent chainslap. Other than that, I'd say that it is worse to try to protect your frame with tape than to just allow it to get an occasional nick and scuff. On a practical note, if you do get some paint chip on a steel frame it is a good idea to dab a little clear nail polish on it to prevent rust from getting started. Finally, if the frame is worth it, you can always have it professionally powder-coated when the time comes. It is like having a new bike. 

I sympathize with the problem. There are just some tire/rim combinations that are extremely difficult. You might have one of these. Some ideas... 

I've never heard of sweatbands, bandana's, or caps being problematic. Curious about what prompts the question? The only thing remotely similar that I have heard IS a potential issue is plastic sun-visors attached to helmets. Apparently these things can come loose in a crash and scratch/poke the face. But linings? No way. Here's a summary of what is involved in the helmet testing used to certify helmets for CPSC, ANSI or Snell compliance. Any issue related to hair or lining would conceivably be addressed by a "rolloff" test. However, in testing the helmet is merely strapped to a form that represents a head size. The standards have no indication related to what's under the helmet other than the size of the form (to test different size helmets). More complete description of testing here. If there is any design or safety accommodation for lining under a helmet, it would probably be addressed by the individual manufacturers, but I've never heard such a thing mentioned except that some helmets are better with ponytails. That said, linings of some form or another have been used widely since helmets have started to be worn. I'd like to know if anybody has heard of any real mishap related to linings under helmets. I suspect there is none. oh... looking further on the bhsi.org, I see there is an article on hair and helmets. 

Double check all hardware is in place and adjusted properly so it doesn't pivot over time. You might or might not be able to find a longer recessed nut to go into your fork hole and thus allow a spacer washer to position the caliper a little bit further from the fork. Replace caliper with something that will fit. It looks from the picture that you're using a dual-pivot brake? Sidepulls are a little smaller and might not interfere with the fork. Replace your track fork with a road fork that can take the brake you need it to take. 

It is a matter of both fit (frame-geom, saddle position, stem & cranks), practice, and gearing. Everyone has a max RPM after which they start "bouncing" and you'll find this RPM is even lower if you're at a relatively low gear. Assuming the bike fits you properly, raising your max RPM is simply a matter of practice. This can't be done at will in one session. It is a motor skill that has to be trained by drills and observed for progress. Informally you can try forcing yourself to ride at lower gears than you're used to. Over time your body kinematics will become more efficient and your form will improve (bouncing will start at higher and higher RPM's). A cadence of 100 without bouncing is achievable by almost anyone who tries for it. Elites on a track have motionless backsides at cadences of well beyond 150rpm. 

A racing bike will usually meet its fate in a crash. Most other bikes just die of neglect-- something wears out, user loses interest, things rust and/or get horribly out of fashion. If you're talking about how to keep a bike running for a VERY long time, that is possible if it is maintained meticulously (or not ridden). All parts can be easily replaced on almost all types of bikes. If not, then with some work contemporary parts can be retrofitted. The best resource in the world for this stuff is the late Sheldon Brown's comprehensive website. After the replaceable stuff, it basically comes down to the frame. Steel or titanium are going to be the most durable and they're repairable by someone with the right tools (for brazing lugs or tig welding). Rust will nail you on steel frames if the frame is exposed to harsh weather without a thorough clean-up afterwards. If you start getting rust it has to be dealt with or else it will get worse. Aluminum is less durable and more susceptible to fatigue cracks through years of use, tubing is thinner and more easily buckles (once something buckles, most people won't want to ride it). Carbon frames just aren't repairable AFAIK and they're usually crashed terminally in a race anyway. I don't see many carbon bikes from 15+ years ago. This could change in the future, but I doubt it. 

Except for differences in size (because women tend to be shorter than men), women's frames are no different than men's frames, really. Although "step-through" frames have typically been marketed as women's frames in the USA, they're ridden by both men and women elsewhere. This type of frame is very convenient for utility and commuter bikes in urban areas where one may want to mount/dismount without swinging a leg over the back of the bike. In other words, the step-through is not really a women's frame. It is just a commuter/city-bike design that is not as sporty looking as a proper diamond frame, but if you're wearing regular trousers or a skirt they're easier to deal with. 

+1 on mathews comprehensive answer. There are definitely more shoe options if you go with "mountain type" systems. However, a "competition grade" mountain shoe with a very rigid sole (like the Sidi dominator) will give you the benefits of a road system with the versatility of mountain stuff. I would seriously have trouble believing anyone who said that good rigid mountain shoes with a mountain pedals could put a road rider at any kind of disadvantage. 

I think it is important to keep in mind that the whole reason behind having a plan for nutrition on long rides is mainly to avoid bonking. You have to regularly consume carbs during long aerobic efforts. The reason for this is NOT because these carbs supply all the energy for the effort. They do not. These carbs make it possible for your body to consume fat as its energy source. Think of them as a "primer" that keeps the fat-burning going during an extended exertion. The exact amount, nature and timing of the carbs consumption seems to vary quite a lot (lots of different opinions). However, according to this, 40-60 g per hour seems to be the range that researchers have studied (that's about one "power bar"). The tricky part is that you have to experiment for yourself with finding the right nutrition for long rides. You don't know how much you need or what your limits are until you try it. The body needs a history of experiences to get acclimated to new challenges. Not enough water/food/sleep, too many hills, too much "racing", too hot--- any of these can cause a bonk on a long ride especially when one is attempting a personal best for either distance or speed. Bonking is not necessarily a ride-ending event. It just means that whoever it happens to will need to chill out for a while and eat something. Hopefully everyone on the ride will be cool with that if it happens. If the distance or speed is going to be very challenging for some folks, it is best to not be on a tight schedule. 

Drop handlebars have been around since the dawn of cycling. Generally speaking, a bike witha chaincase is likely to be a commuter and thus not likely to also have drop bars. There is nothing that prevents you from retro-fitting chaincase or dropbars, however.
