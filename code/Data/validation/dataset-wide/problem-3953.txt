The answers already posted are quite satisfying, I'd just like to add one more point of view (at the risk of making the thing more confused for the OP :). When Sobolev started solving PDEs, he did not have reasonable function spaces available: working in $C^2$ is a nightmare as soon as you want to do calculus of variations, and it is immediately clear that 'something is missing'. You naturally construct solutions by approximating them (with minimizing sequences, with smooth approximations etc. etc.). The original approach of Sobolev was: well, all I have is this approximating sequence, so THIS SEQUENCE is my solution, whatever that means. This was his original definition of 'weak solution'. As you see, he was dispensing completely with completeness, and working only with functions in a dense subspace. This is perfectly fine, and I'm tempted to answer to the original question with the paradox: completeness is not really necessary, even from a theoretical standpoint, since of course you can embed every normed space in a complete one. But this is very awkward; it is vastly more economical to 'define' the limit of your approximating sequence. Indeed, this procedure is precisely what is called completion. Working in a complete space makes it possible to take the limit of your approximation and define a solution as a concrete object. 100 yeasr later, we find this approach totally natural. I think this was one of the driving forces behind the universal adoption of complete spaces in analysis. 

To my knowledge the usual approach to define manifold valued spaces is to embed the target manifold $M$ in some $R^N$, then consider the space of all functions $u:\Omega\to R^N$ which are in $H^1(\Omega,R^N)$ and in addition take their values in $M$: $u(x)\in M$ for a.e. $x\in \Omega$. For a basic example of this approach see the paper by Brezis and Mironescu (On some questions of topology for $S^1$ valued fractional Sobolev spaces) where functions with values in $S^1$ are considered. You will agree that in that case a very natural definition is to put a priori the constraint $|u|=1$ on the functions. Of course, you end up with considering bounded functions only, but this solves most of the problems you are facing with your definition. 

Of course. When $\nu=1$, if you apply the operator $\partial_t-\partial^2_{xx}$ to the last integral you obtain precisely $f(t,x)$ so the equation is $$ f_t - f_{xx} = (\partial_t-\partial^2_{xx}) J_0^2 + f.$$ EDIT: you seem to know already the answer, so I stop here :) You edited your question when I was writing my answer... By the way, if you want to solve the PDE just set $ f(t,x) = e^{t} g(t,x) $ and the equation in $g$ is a homogeneous heat equation. This sounds like some textbook exercise, I musr say 

The review system for research projects in Italy (during the last few years; it is possibly going to change now) was based on comparing the opinions of two different anonymous referees. At some point the two referees have to exchange opinions with each other and reach an agreement, while remaining anonymous. In practice, this is achieved by channeling communications through a website based at a central location. I post my comments, the other referee can read them and post his comments, etc. Since we both know that our exchange is watched by some official at the Ministry, we feel some pressure as to not revealing our identity. I think this works pretty well, and should work also for peer review. Actually, several journals have already an electronic system for reports; at the moment it is a little awkward to use it as a communication tool, because of the many steps involved (the messages must be approved through the chain referee->editor->chief editor->editor->author or something like that), but it should be quite easy to make it faster and transform it into a supervised direct channel between referee and author. 

You should maybe clarify your question; what are the general definitions you are trying to compare, and what kind of result are you interested in? The first quantity in your question, which you call Sobolev, when $1 < p < \infty $, is equivalent to the following: $$ \|f\| _{L^p} ^p + \|\Delta f\| _{L^p}^p. $$ The second quantity in your question, which you call Beppo Levi, is equivalent to $$ \| \Delta f \|_{L^2}^2.$$ So for $p=2$ the first quantity controls the second one (after taking appropriate $p$-th and square roots). For $p\neq2$ the situation is more complicated but in general they are not comparable. 

Sure. Actually you have in addition the maximum principle (i.e. an $L^\infty$--$L^\infty$ estimate) which combined with the others gives a full triangle of indices for the Strichartz type estimates in your question. Even more, the strong decay of the symbol $e^{-t|\xi|^2}$ can be exploited for some gains in regularity. A short account is in the book by Wang, Huo, Hao, Guo "Harmonic analysis method for nonlinear evolution equations" (around p.35) link 

Dorian, aren't you messing up things a little? Surely you can expand any $L^2$ function in a series of eigenfunctions for the elliptic operator, but please notice that this simple fact already requires quite a detailed theory of elliptic operators on bounded domains. In order to prove the existence of eigenfunctions you must be able to solve the equation $Lu=\lambda u$, and if you want to use your expansion for regularity results, you need to study the properties of the eigenfunctions, their growth etc. But actually you are right, in a sense. It is indeed possible to prove existence and regularity of solution at the interior of the domain by using essentially the same methods as on the whole space. However, if you want to control the properties of the solution at the boundary, then this requires new tools. As a minimum, in the lucky situation of a smooth boundary, you can reduce to the case of a half space, but no less than that. If you are not convinced, think of the fact that some results cease to be true if you drop the assumption that the boundary is Lipschitz or satisfies some suitable cone condition. As you suspect, it is also possible to do frequency space analysis much in the same way as on the whole space, but I would not call this easy. There is a beautiful set of notes "Lectures on semiclassical analysis" available on the web, by Evans and Zworsky, see Theorem 3.17 there (they prove interior Schauder estimates using Paley-Littlewood, apparently following a suggestion of H.Smith). I repeat: this is interior regularity, the behaviour at the boundary is substantially more difficult. 

The question is vague (Denis is right) but it does make some sense. When looking at explicit solutions of nonlinear PDEs one frequently encounters singularities that remind of projections from some higher dimensional manifold (e.g. in Burger's equation). But I think the OP does not have a clear picture. Locally, working 'on' a manifold instead than on $R^n$ is essentially like changing coordinates in the equation. So usually you do not resolve nonlinearities, you just modify the coefficients of the equation. On the other hand, if you consider equations with values into a manifold, then sometimes a very difficult nonlinear term reveals to be a very simple geometric object, 'linear' in some sense. This does not happen by chance; your equation must have some geometric meaning. Best examples are harmonic maps (elliptic) and wave maps (hyperbolic). Some years ago, Serge Alinhac tried to develop a whole theory of 'geometric blow up': singularities in the solution which can be resolved by choosing an appropriate coordinate sistem in the target space. But I guess the results where not too satisfying since he abandoned the effort. 

I'd say the natural structure on $E$ is one of a Frechet space, given by the family of seminorms $\|f\|_{L^2(K_n)}$. Each local space generated by each seminorm is reflexive (Hilbert) so the resulting topology is reflexive. Then if you take the quotient by the closed subspace of constant functions you get again a reflexive space. Details in this nice set of lectures by Dietmar Vogt. 

The answers already given are quite complete and say it all, but maybe the OP was in search of a very simple explanation of what is happening. Let me try. You will agree that it is not necessary to work in the full generality of an n-th order equation; if we can do it for the first order case, it is easy to generalize by induction. Moreover, we can assume that the highest order coefficient is equal to 1 (just divide by it). So essentially the question is: let $u$ be a weak solution of the equation $$ u' + a(x) u = f(x) $$ on an open interval, with $ a(x) $ and $ f(x) $ analytic. Then we want to prove that $u$ is also analytic. A further reduction is possible: multiply both sides by $\exp (A(x)) $ where $A'=a$ and call $ v = e^A u $, $g=e^A f$. Then we are reduced to proving the same thing for the simple equation $$ v ' = g. $$ Is $v$ analytic if $g$ is analytic? A further reduction is possible! just call $ w=v-G $, where $G'=g$. Nice trick eh? we are reduced to the even simpler equation $$ w' = 0 $$ and our serach will be over if we prove the fundamental fact that any weak solution of $w'=0$ must be a constant function. Notice that the same chain of arguments applies if the coefficients are $C^\infty$ (you get that $u$ is also $C^\infty$) and if $f$ is just $C^k$. Now, in the greatest possible generality, if $w$ is any distribution on an open interval, with vanishing derivative, then $w$ must be a constant. This is proved in the following way: by definition, we know that $ w(\phi')=0 $ for any test function $\phi$. Fix a test function $\chi$ with $\int\chi=1$. Let $\psi$ be an arbitrary test function, define $$ \psi_1 = \psi-\chi \cdot \int \psi $$ and notice that $\int\psi_1=0$. This means that $ \psi_1 $ can be written as the derivative of another test function (guess which one?) $\psi_1=\psi_2'$ and hence $$w(\psi_1) = w(\psi_2') = 0 $$ by assumption. This implies $$ w(\psi) = w(\chi) \cdot \int \psi $$ which in the language of distributions means precisely that $w$ is equal to the constant $w(\chi)$ (notice that $\chi$ is fixed once and for all). That's it. 

There are many references at various levels of difficulty; it also depends on what aspects are you interested in. I cite out of memory, so beware of inaccuracies (which can be corrected according to your needs). A very good reference is Hormander I (The theory of linear partial diff. op), chapter VIII. The emphasis there is on the $C^\infty$ theory, with Hormander's own definition of WF as a limit. You cutoff the function near a point, Fourier transform it, then examine in which directions the Fourier transform decays fast and in which ones it does not. These last directions stabilize as the cutoff support tends to the point, and what remains is the WF set at the point. Further results, written in an even denser style, are contained in Michael Taylor's book on Pseudodifferential Operators. More recently, the concept has been generalized to include directions of Sobolev regularity and has found applications in nonlinear equations; there results are scattered in a number of papers (JM Bony wrote some papers on this). There are other points of view; an important one is the analytic wave front set. Here the accent is more on the algebraic aspects, since the set of all solutions to an equation or system of PDEs is studied as a whole. Here the best references are japanese, a good starting point being Akira Kaneko's book on hyperfunction theory, and continuing with the works of Kashiwara (including a book), Sato, Schapira. EDIT: I understand that an easier introduction would be helpful. You should try with section II.B of Alinhac-Gerard Operateurs pseudodifferentiels et Theoreme de Nash-Moser. It's very readable (assuming you read french :) 

There exists a plethora of inequalities relating weighted $L^p$ norms of a function and its derivatives. For instance you have the Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg family of inequalities $$\| |x|^{-\gamma}u\|_ {L^{r}}\le C \||x|^{-\alpha}\nabla u\|^{a}_ {L^{p}}\||x|^{-\beta}u\|^{1-a}_ {L^{q}} $$ which hold for a quite large range of parameters; note that here $\alpha,\beta,\gamma$ may assume negative values. You will not have difficulty in googling the vast literature on the subject (let me add that there is a recent paper of mine on arXiv with some improvements on this). 

I need a pretty standard interior regularity result for a second order elliptic operator of the form $$ -\nabla^b \cdot (A(x) \nabla^b v)+c v=f, \qquad \nabla^b=\nabla+ib(x) $$ where $A(x)$ is a bounded uniformly strictly positive symmetric matrix, $b(x)$ takes values in $R^n$ and $c$ is real valued. If the coefficients are smooth it is trivial to prove that if $f\in L^2_{loc}$ then $v\in H^2_{loc}$. The twist is that I need to assume as little regularity as possible on the coefficients, and precisely in the divergence form above. I would like to assume $b$ in the Lorentz space $L^{n,\infty}$ and $c$ in $L^{n/2,\infty}$, possibly with some smallness assumption on the negative part of $c$. Concerning $A(x)$ I think that continuity should be enough (see e.g. Theorem 17.1.1 in Hormander III which is pretty close to what I need), but I am ok with locally Lipschitz $A(x)$. Note that if you expand the divergence form you get some derivatives of $b$, but I would rather not assume anything on the derivatives of $b$. Now, it should be straightforward to write a proof but I am pretty sure that a good reference exists where this problem is studied in detail with sharp results. Any suggestion? 

I might be wrong, but there answer to you general question is 'no'. Take an arbitrary function with $L^2$ norm equal to one, then start an orthogonalization procedure (which leaves your first function fixed) and produce an ONB. You have no way to bound the sup norm of the first function. But your actual needs seem much more natural, and standard. For an ONB which arises as the eigenfunction set of a given selfadjoint, positive, elliptic operator $L$ of order $m$, you can resort to an elementary Sobolev embedding. Let $f_j$ be the eigenfunction corresponding to the eigenvalue $c_j$. Then the sup norm of $f_j$ is less than the $H^{1/2+\epsilon}$ norm of $f_j$, which is equivalent to the $L^2$ norm of $L^{\frac 1{2m}+\epsilon}f_j=c_j^{\frac 1{2m}+\epsilon}f_j$ which is exactly $c_j^{\frac 1{2m}+\epsilon}$. In general I think you can not do better than that. When $L$ is the Laplace-Beltrami operator on some compact manifold, or powers thereof, there exist much more precise results. 

You have probably already thought of this, anyway: a way to produce 'explicit' formulas for the Riemann distance is via the heat kernel $p(t,x,y)$ and Varadhan's $$\lim_{t\to0+}t\log p(t,x,y)=-d(x,y)^2.$$ This might be interesting since there is a business of computing heat kernels for elliptic operators, which in some cases can be locally interpreted as Laplacians in some metric. See e.g. Beals, or the results of Hulanicki and Gaveau. 

One way to partially answer your last question might be the following. To each $f\in L^2(a,b)$, first associate its Lebesgue primitive $F(x)=\int_a ^x f(t)dt$, then define $Tf$ as one of the four Dini derivatives of $F$, e.g. $$ Tf(x)=\limsup _{h\to 0^+}h^{-1}(F(x+h)-F(x)).$$ Then $Tf=Tg$ everywhere if $f=g$ almost everywhere, $Tf=f$ almost everywhere, and $Tf$ is continuous if $f$ is equivalent to a continuous function. Thus the map $T$ associates to all members of a class of equivalence in $L^2$ the same function, which is the continuous representative of the class when it exists. An additional advantage is that the method is 'constructive'. 

Let $X$ be a Banach space and $K:X\to X$ be a compact operator. If $I+K$ is injective then it is onto and hence the inverse $(I+K)^{-1}$ is bounded. What kind of qualitative or quantitative assumptions on $K$ are necessary in order to find an explicit bound on the operator norm of $(I+K)^{-1}$? In such generality, there is probably no answer (or there are too many), so let me be more specific and explain the situation I've encountered this. The Banach space is either $L^\infty$ or a weighted $L^2$ with weight $(1+|x|)^s$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$, these cases are all of interest. Call $H_0$ the operator $-\Delta$, $V\ $ the multiplication by a function $V(x)$, and $H=H_0+V$. This should all be properly defined but I leave the definitions aside so to accommodate as many additional assumptions as necessary. A standard procedure in spectral theory is to express the resolvent operator $R(z)=(H-z)^{-1}$ as a perturbation of $R_0(z)=(H_0-z)^{-1}$ through the formula $$ R_0(z)=R(z)(I+VR_0(z)). $$ Now the main step: assume we know that $VR_0$ is a compact operator and $I+VR_0$ is injective (this typically amounts to requiring that $H$ has no eigenvalues, or resonances). Then we can invert $I+VR_0$ and write $$ R(z)=R_0(z)(I+VR_0(z))^{-1} $$ which is a very powerful formula, but, alas!, not quantitative. Is there a way to bound the norm of the inverse based on any reasonable assumption on $H_0$ and $V$? Notice that the operator $K=VR_0$ is very explicit, one can write an explicit integral kernel and extract any kind of detailed information on it. Additionally, one can make any sort of assumption on the perturbed operator $H=H_0+V$ (e.g., about the distance of the eigenvalues from the continuous spectrum etc.) EDIT: I might add that in the example the main point is to obtain a uniform estimate for the norm of $R(z)$ as $z$ approaches the real axis, which contains the spectrum of $H$. Otherwise it might seem odd to look for an estimate on $R(z)$, which is already a well defined and bounded operator on $L^2$, with known bounds. But this procedure gives a reasonable definition of $R(z)$ also for real $z$, certainly not as a bounded operator on $L^2$ but on different spaces.
