Halos seem to be an artistic symbol to depict light. There are not really halos on people except in paintings unless of course you can see auras. I do not see auras. Here is an explanation of the symbology of light and halos. $URL$ the actual depiction of the Buddha happened long after cessation and nirvana. Here is more on that. $URL$ To me a question that still tantalizes me, how can I experience the consciousness that Buddha experienced? I don't care about halos, or titles or attainments, I will forego all of those. Just give me that mind that was in Buddha. That is all I really want in this world or another. Just let me see with the illumined mind, the mind that has experienced cessation, the bodhisattva mind that will not cease suffering until all sentient beings experience release. That is enough for me. Thank you for your question. Whether answer helped I am uncertain. But I know what is dearest in the center of my being. 

samatha is a term frequently used. No problem defining that. Passadha is not easily defined by web search. It appears and Portuguese and greek. here is a link referring to passadha referring to the eye center. $URL$ Perhaps there are other terms for passadha that are more widely used. 

Soto is the form of Shunryu Suzuki and even Dogen and one I am more familiar with. This tends to be different in application than Rinzai Zen in a very strict monastery. I only watched first 7 minutes where walking is quite ordinary. Perhaps someone who can watch the 2 hour documentary will share further insights. 

Life in between, existence in between, would be existence as well, or? So to give it a special notion, this rebirth as well, does not make much sense aside of possible willing to serve the everywhere common cultural aspect of untrained people in the teachings of the Noble Ones, that there is a lasting, independent spirit, searching for new body. As Upasaka Sankha Kulathantille told in his answere, there is no mind without matter, no being without object. That counts as well for the "non"-material states, which just have mind objects instead of classical matter as object. After each death, decay, a rebirth follows, moment for moment, as well for lager appearences of aggregating, which are common taken as living being. Many existences are very short or "fail" after boming into being in a womb, so that they are regarded as having come into being at large. There might be the mystery of this distinction be found. In folk perceptions there is no difference, exept of time and traditions in detail, within different countries and cultures and can be traced in western world as well, even in modern stories and movies, my person guesses. The "living being in search for becoming" accurs also in the Pali canon, thinking on the Karaṇīya Metta-Sutta and may serve here especially to catch all possible perception a person may have in regard of existence and living. 

It seems to be clear that Pureland practice focuses nearly exclusively on Jhana and refined becoming while teaching in regard of wisdom, incl. the explaining of Jhana and becoming seems to be merely total absent. Isn't the main aim, or general objected aim there a becoming in a refined sphere of being in the Immaterial World and joy in concentration their main focus? Of cause, my person is not really into those spheres of undertakings by the Westernland-seeker and those being, dwelling there. Maybe an answer: "No, just, merely uninstructed and not noted/know, practiced" might be proper.

I could tell you some pseudo zen wisdom that I have learned to spinoff after reading zen masters from the past. Study Dogen or Shunryu Suzuki. I especially like Zen Mind Beginners Mind the uses the term Beginners Mind in place of enlightenment. Enlightenent sounds like something that strikes like lightning. Beginner's mind is more like a sudden wind that stops you in your tracks, you look around, and nothing is there. But you experienced something without preconception. Maybe a glimpse of beginners mind $URL$ 

So all of Milarepa's black magic only leads him into a karmic mess that must unwind. So what is the benefit of creating Tulpas or thoughtforms or black magic when it only brings us deeper into the karmic mud? If you can imagine an enlightened master and he helps you to awaken, then perhaps there is some value in this practice, but be careful because what claims to be a master might only be someone to enslave you in passion. Be very careful. Some sites on the internet actually talked about creating women and men to be lovers with Tulpas. This is as foolish as following the desires in the body. It only leads to suffering. Ask yourself deeply what is your intention in this pursuit if you must pursue it. If it is only to satisfy desires, then you only sink deeper in the mud.

No, the practices are causes of the unconditional result of Nibbana. Things in the past or future do not even exist to ultimate reality. We can't understand this without practicing virtue and witnessing what really is in the present moment(mindfulness or Vipassana) moment by moment 

How does a mindfulness practitioner use judgment? I don't know if that is clear about how to judge or not judge in the Eightfold Path. Is it not clear because different Buddhisms disagree? 

If you are practicing to liberate yourself from your own habits that cause suffering then you could practice seeing your experience as it is in the present moment, moment by moment. You would intentionally focus your awareness on whatever aspect of your experience you are drawn to or whatever aspect of your experience that is the most appropriate to focus your awareness towards. Slowly you will begin to gain insights into how your mind and body works. This has the effect of unraveling the bad habits and reactions. When there are no more bad habits then you no longer suffer even when you are in pain because you no longer are reactive to the pain as it is just a feeling. I recommend that you find a insight meditation method and stick to it. Also, if you can, find a qualified teacher because it is extremely difficult to be a successful meditator without a good teacher. I hope this helps 

Thats what it's all about. When practicing metta I usually feel this profound sense of dignity I suppose because all my defilments are temporarily gone. The Buddha's teaching guides those who are willing to listen to dignity, selflessness and beyond. 

Fear can lead to anger and can also lead to lashing out at others in order to "protect" our self, as though it is vulnerable to another. And here are some of the precepts to deal with and overcome anger $URL$ 

I present the perspective of Zen through the eyes of Dogen to show a different shade of meaning of attachment and the universality of attachment and non-attachment as a precept of Buddhism $URL$ 

From what I read in several sources, the straightness of the back is not as important as the intention of the meditator. Here is where I was reading [CTRL F and insert "straight" in the search box] $URL$ 

It is my understanding from reading Dogen that everyone already has Nirvana within them and it is hidden by a mask and revealed through sincere practice $URL$ 

If you look at this through the Zen aspect of Buddhism and other aspects as well, creating a thoughtform if this is even possible would be a failure to follow instructions. In meditation following the breath and counting is a way to stop running after thought forms. Thought forms are as imperfect as imagination allows. Take someone on psychotropic drugs that sees things they do not see in regular life. Where does that come from is not important to the Buddhist as how to get back to the breath and the beginner's mind. Milarepa is an example of someone who could use black magic to kill people.$URL$ You can read about his black magic, but here is a more relevant detail, the outcome of his karma, remorse.
