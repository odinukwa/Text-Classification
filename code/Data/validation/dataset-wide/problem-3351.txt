I'd like to ask some Albanian speakers to say pairs of words which come as close to possible as differing only by one of each pair having "l" and the other having "ll". I'm trying to hear and reproduce the difference. Does Albanian have any such minimal pairs? 

The sixth letter of the Georgian alphabet is and all the resources I have describe it as being like English or IPA . But especially in the common word (goodbye) the sounds a lot more like an English than an English . So what's happening here? I can't seem to find anything mentioning approximants or semivowels in Georgian at all. 

This question triggered a memory of a thread in my favourite language blog. I couldn't recall exactly the name of the post of what words were discussed, but in my question for it I turned up another thread containing comments about these terms: 

Is this the case or is it more complex than that? I think I've heard it described as having three and a half genders too. How is this like and unlike gender and is it sometimes described as being another gender outside linguistics circles or do I have even that wrong? (Note that I'm specifically asking about nouns so please don't submit answers about pronouns) 

Though there are many theories grouping Korean and Japanese in the same family, none of these are widely accepted by linguists. Yet the grammars of these two languages are extremely similar in many ways: 

It's widely claimed that Japanese and Korean have very similar grammars despite their differences in (non Chinese-derived) lexicon. Whether they're actually genetically related can be regarded as an open question though the consensus has them in separate families but recognizes at least a strong Sprachbund. In assessing the extent of the similarities and differences I'm interested in Korean's adjectives. In the case of Japanese there is a class of adjectives that behave like nouns, they are called "-na adjectives". The second class of Japanese adjectives conjugate very much verbs and are called "-i adjectives". Is there a similar division in the adjective system of Korean, or is this one of the differences between the two grammars? 

Many native English speakers might also do some of these at least as typos or thinking faster than they write, but not 3. and probably not 4. Taken together I would expect you were a foreigner. My first impression from 3. is that you might be a French speaker. So even without pronunciation your syntax would give you away, as would any and all the many points where two languages can differ. (Vocabulary, pronunciation, syntax, exceptions to rules, intonation, contractions, idioms, etc, etc) (You seem to have excellent English by the way) 

There is a Malayo-Polynesian language in Bengkulu, Indonesia with about 350,000 speakers called Rejang, Redjang, or Rejangese. It has its own native Brahmic abugida. But I'm wondering if it also has a Latin orthography which is used to a degree equal to or greater than the native script. It could also be possible that all writing is in the national language, Indonesian, leaving Rejang as mostly a spoken language in modern times. Information in Wikipedia and the Internet generally is sparse. Some solid information on whether and to which degree Rejang is written in Latin script would be appreciated. 

It has seemed to me (though I might be wrong) that languages usually take either prepositions (English, German, Spanish) or postpositions (Japanese, Hungarian, Turkish). (Yes I know sometimes a different term is used as for Chinese but those come before the noun like in English). But I've noticed as I learn more about some languages that they have exceptions. For instance, English ago acts much more like a postposition than a preposition (though dictionaries traditionally call it an adverb). Georgian, which I'm currently learning, has most postpositions. But it also has გარეშე (gareshe), which can be used as both postposition and preposition. I've also read that it has some prepositions borrowed from Russian but I haven't learned any of those yet. So is this a case where "there's an exception to every rule" and most languages turn out to have a few instance of the opposite adposition to how they are usually classified, or have I chanced to bump into some of the rare exceptions? 

Are these modern Sanskrit speakers studied? Are they preserving a holy language or is it evolving like a real living language? 

A Saudi friend on our sister site, travel.stackexchange.com, was just telling me there is an isolated language in his country called "Fifa'a", but that nothing is written about it on the internet as far as he can find. I also can't find any information on it. But it seems to have some other spellings: Fayfa, Faifa, etc. He mentioned that some people regard it as a dialect of Arabic but others do not. He tells me it has a similar sound to Arabic but a totally different grammar. Is Fifa'a a dialect of Arabic? Where can I even read anything about it? 

If a property can possess a value along a scale then generally values toward each end of the scale are seen as opposites. Then there are properties which can have one of two values, which can of course be analysed as a special case of the previous. I'm sure some people analyse "male" and "female" to be antonyms, and people who would strongly refute it. They can certainly be argued against semantically. If two words are nouns then they need refer to objects having one property which has "opposing" values. Some nouns have more than one property capable of this. Others have none. 

Most minority languages written in the major Southeast Asian scripts (Burmese, Khmer, Lao, Thai) probably don't use spaces either, but I don't have details. Minority Southeast Asian languages using their own native scripts (Tai Lue etc) might not use spaces, but I don't have details. Other observations I believe scripts that had different final forms of letters, such as Greek and Hebrew used them to provide hints about word boundaries since spaces between words were not always consistently used in ancient times. 

I'm in Mongolia trying to learn some Mongolian and I've come across their cute word for "litlle", "small": жижиг. On previous trips through Turkey I recall learning a similar cute word for "little", "small": küçük. I'm no fanboi of the Altaic Hypothesis but it's pretty accepted here and of course there is lots of contact between Mongolic and Turkic to allow loanwords by some route. Though I would've thought this would be core vocabulary not usually borrowed. 

I should add that I'm aware some languages, like Japanese, have agglutinating typology for verbs but not for nouns, so those are probably not languages I'm interested in for this question. 

It seems that the tones are quite different but I believe these tend to change more freely between dialects so I would assume even more freely when borrowing to another tonal language. 

I've returned my language focus to Lao now that my travels through Asia have finished and I'm back home. There are not as many or as high quality resources available for Lao as for many other languages so I'm looking for some help to find some things I'm interested in for my investigations. I would like to find either or both a word frequency and syllable frequency list for Lao. Normally I make my own frequency lists but as Lao lacks word breaks creating a frequency list requires a good morphological analyser. Syllables are said to be unambiguous but I'm not convinced. I'm thinking about making my own syllabification algorithm but have not yet done so. If anybody is aware of a freely available "syllabifier" or morphological analyser for Lao, those would also be of interest.
