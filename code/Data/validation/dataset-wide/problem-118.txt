Pumping Out Supergreenhouse Gases Dichlorodifluoromethane, $CCl_2F_2$, or CFC-12, better known as Freon-12, alongside Sulfur hexafluoride $SF_6$ are two extremely potent greenhouse gases, thousands to tens of thousands of times more powerful, molecule for molecule, than CO2. That means that you can get a similar effect with much smaller atmospheric concentrations. Instead of parts-per-million you can have parts per billion and get the same effect. On Earth, you have $2.996×10^{12}$ tons of CO2 in the air, so to get the same effect you'd need only a few hundred million tons of the super-greenhouse gas. Our civilization outputs 10,000 tons of $SF_6$ every year as a byproduct of industrial manufacturing. A determined campaign to create more could easily output truly industrial amounts into the planetary atmosphere in a few years. Most of these gases have a lifetime in the atmosphere measured in the thousands of years, before they are disintegrated by reactions or by UV radiation, so unless you trigger a positive feedback, you'll have to have a generator forever outputting small amount of the gas to compensate for this loss-rate. Ending the Ice-age Since you specify that your planet starts off as a iceball wasteland with a narrow barely livable band around the equator, you need to do something about all that ice, since ice has a high albedo (reflects off heat) while ocean has a low albedo (dark blue absorbs better), so melting the ice would help push and keep the world outside of its ice-age. Additionally, being able to have more water vapor stay in the warmer atmosphere should contribute massively to the greenhouse effect (water vapor on Earth is reckoned to account for about 80-98% of the greenhouse effect, depending on whom you ask). The cheapest way is to simply cover your glaciers with a dark layer at the top to remove the albedo issue. This way, you amplify the solar absorption many-fold. You might have to periodically redo this to compensate for runoff. The next lowest level would involve building a vast number of fission reactors which are simply used to generate the largest amount of heat, with a pipe network gradually extended to melt the vast glaciers, in the same way some houses have electric bathroom tile-warming. Finally, if you have basic space technology, you can deploy light-weight reflector mirrors, but they'd still be stymied by the ice albedo issue unless you already addressed that. Dealing With the Mess Your ocean levels will increase tremendously, your glaciers will destroy the landscape as they melt, and the permafrost ground will collapse as it melts and it's battered by the ocean and runoff. Even under optimistic scenarios, it'll be centuries before the earth settles into a new stable configuration. 

Numerous synonyms for relevant terms, just like the Eskimos' alleged 40 words for snow. Consider the sheer number of synonyms for the word “steal”: Cloy, Do, Filch, File, Fleece, Give it to, Heave, Knap, and a dozen others. Or the myriad ways of referring to gallows: Chates, Crap, Gregorian Tree, Morning Drop, etc. Sets of replacement words for generic nouns and verbs: 'ken' meant 'place', 'cheat' meant 'thing', as in "bleating cheat" would be a sheep. "Fake a ken" meant to "rob a place." Most slang words are short (and sweet) 1 or 2 syllables at most, and yet are recognizably English: One can "snilch" or "york" at something and then decide to "fam" something, "milling" the victim if needed. Lots of derogatory words for upper classes, cops, women, various minorities, ugly people, you name it. You don't wanna come across as a "Twiddle Poop" for instance. 

"Nothing beside remains. Round the decay Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare The lone and level sands stretch far away." Any functional city has many moving parts, and moving parts wear out. Magnitude 9+ earthquakes can crack and twist the landscape itself, divert rivers and crush stone. Rivers can carve stone over the aeons. Temperature variations can microfracture stones. Moss and fungi can grow on the smallest crack in the hardest stone. Dust particles deposit and build themselves to tens of meters. Lands can be submerged, or sunk beneath the sands. Ice-ages can layer 3 kilometers of rock-hard ice on top of your structures and grind them into dust. So, what do all these reasons it can't be done that tell us about how to do it? 

It is hard to say for sure. We have the concept of a habitable zone (area around a star that allows for the presence of liquid water on the surface), but it may be that far more conditions (rotational axis stabilization by moon, active plate tectonics to recycle material lost to the oceanic abyss, presence of a Jupiter to shield us from the worst of the Late Heavy Bombardment, etc) need to be in place for life to evolve. It might well be that we are living on the only life-bearing-planet in the galaxy. That said, if it somehow happens that two planets are auspicious to life around the same star (and there's nothing to say it can't happen), it is possible, even likely, that both planets will eventually host life, if only because of meteoric cross-contamination (some meteor impacts blast rock from one world, containing live bacteria or spores, all the way onto the second world). Now, our ignorance is even deeper concerning the circumstance under which life becomes intelligent enough to be sentient. While there has been a historical trend on Earth towards more intelligence on average over the hundreds of millions of years ( brainless worms ---> foxes), it's far from clear that the high biological costs of intelligence are always outweighed by the advantages the extra smarts confers. We honestly don't know what fraction of planets with life on them go on to ever develop intelligent life. 

The evil enemy has us surrounded. They outnumber our forces, they have us outgunned. These helldogs have a trillion dollars/year for their war budget, and they can afford the fanciest toys, numerous mercenaries, the most advanced munitions, have overwhelming air supremacy, and are backed up by years of research and training. They are unlikely to show much restraint (save for not using nuclear weapons, we think their populist leader is allergic to them). We have the city of Lusom, population 3 million. We have close to 300,000 fighters in the city, and overwhelming support from the population (or at least that's what we think, it's not like we're holding elections, haha). We are absolutely ruthless about crushing dissent, and our troops are fantastically committed. No civilians will get out. We have also had years to prepare, execute spies, dig in, fortify, amass supplies of all kinds. The vile enemy has one (critical) weakness: a fickle public opinion. If we can but hold out for maybe two years, or cause upwards of 10,000 enemy casualties, we can probably get them to back off and run home. That triumph would cause the political situation around Lusom to change dramatically, as the demoralized allies of the evil enemy will surely collapse like a wet napkin without the big dog backing them. How do we make sure we can hold out in Lusom for 700 days? 

Build Solar Panels ... in SPACE Well, when you think about it, no matter what resources we use here on Earth, $\Large\textit{there is this giant}$ $\Large\textit{supersized storage place and}$ $\Large\textit{power station}$ (a large cloud of hydrogen which seems to have caught fire we call the Sun) a few minutes away at the center of our system. Think about it. The average whole-humanity consumption is about 16TW (in 2010), while the Sun shines about 174,000 TW on Earth alone, and about 3,846,000,000,000,000 TW more into empty space each second. That's an unimaginable amount of power, and virtually every Joule of it is wasted every second. So the best thing you could do for future generations is to start creating a large and ever expanding cloud of solar panels around the sun, and use that surplus to power a space industry to build more and more and more solar capture technology! The technology for creating solar panels is already with us. Technologies for mining the asteroid belt (for raw materials, to save us the pain of space launches) are being developed currently by private companies in the Western world. There is nothing technically stopping us from deploying a massive solar array in space, aside from the initial launch costs and the political will to do so. Space based solar power has numerous advantages over regular solar. It does not take up any valuable ecosystem from the natural wild areas. It does not suffer from intermittent supply due to night or weather. It does not get dusty, for the most part. The power can be transmitted wirelessly (and has been for decades) so with some modifications it could be transmitted from space as well Once the 'Dyson' cloud of solar panels is built, store antimatter There are now considerable technological difficulties with antimatter production & storage, but if the technologies for production and storage can be miniaturized and made significantly more efficient (right now we're producing antimatter by smashing atom beams together -- bit like trying to produce gasoline by shooting cannon into a methane chamber) it could be the most volume- and conversion-ratio-wise efficient form of energy storage we know of in terms of space-ship reaction mass. Furthermore, the construction process for the solar encasement will realistically take a few million years, so that gives ample time for science to advance and better magnetic confinement devices to be devised. Once the Dyson sphere is built, you can store your excess power as antimatter in containment fields, collossal flywheels, whatever. But our descendants will have zillions of times more power than we did before them. In fact, it's irresponsible not to do it. It's the only way we could have enough power to move out of the Solar system if we decide we don't like it here anymore, or the sun (billions of years from now) goes dark. Storing this energy in space will save you from having to carry this TO space with you. The saying goes that once you're out of the Earth's gravity well, you're energetically speaking halfway to anyplace in the solar system. Moreover, the exercise of building this massive space project will give mankind the much needed practice with building space-habitats and robust space vehicle, something that again you can only learn by being in space, not by saving every little watt on Earth. 

More maps here. Currently North Hemispheric powers account for over two thirds of global GDP and about 80% of global military spending. Is there anything powers in Europe and North America, armed with the power of all modern technology, can do to retain their global economic and military status given the coming ice age? 

Much effort went into creating sims, uploaded personalities obtained through destructive scanning of a person's brain. These efforts have largely been successful. Whilst officially banned in the civilized world, the practice has gained significant currency, and terminally ill rich people now routinely travel to Transnistria, where you can still buy bullets by the bucket, semi-sentient anti-aircraft missiles, and yes, get a (sometimes dubious quality) mind upload done with no legal hassles. The Sims are passing the Turing test with no issues, and for the most part (save for the occasional abomination), sound indistinguishable to living friends and relatives from the original. Increasingly, the sims are fighting to gain legal recognition as "Remnanters" - legal successors of the dead Person they used to be. However, problems soon crop up in dealing with identity. One can (and sometimes does) create multiple copies of the same uploaded personality. So Richie Rich travels to Transnistria, gets their brain "read" and creates a Richie Remnanter A, who is placed in an android body and walks the Earth again. A different version of Richie Rich, Richie Remnanter B, chooses to stay in a virtual environment running at 10x real-life speed. I have thought of 3 approaches: 

Any and all planets, even rogues would have had liquid range water. Unfortunately, this window lasted only a few million years. So the 4 billion year RNA -> NASA evolution we experienced here would have to happen about 1000 times faster, which is, um, rather unlikely. Furthermore, the same enriching process that would have created the materials for the star (supernovas) would still be going on, probably sterilizing all planetoids on a regular basis. Moreover, a planetoid even if it had formed superfast would not have had time to cool off to liquid water temperatures, especially since it would be getting blasted with warm CMB radiation from all directions. 

Note: To my mind, the obvious criterion for a good answer would be a listing of plausible actions (artificially sustained if need be, but keep it realistic) that would boost the total $biomass$ and $biodiversity$ to the max. I'm open to being convinced of better criteria. 

So does my (anti)hero need to sneak into a coal power plant after all? Or perhaps I could alter the setting a bit: How far into the future do I have to go to have renewables consistently (not just for a few minutes at peak production) and reliably provide a vast majority of the power being produced? The goal here is not a forecast, although I won't turn those away if you got them, but rather your sense of what would be plausible. 

Human organizations generally can achieve more than a single human individual, despite partial or complete non-overlap in incentive structures and strategic goals among the members of the organization. This is due to several factors. First, humans have limited attention span and limited capabilities to manipulate the environment per unit of time. When a task to be accomplished can be broken up into parallelizable chunks, organizations that have evaluators and enforcers can often produce results broadly aligned with the goals of the decision makers in a fraction of the time and with significantly better error correction than a single individual could. For example, it takes the combined efforts of thousands (tens millions if you work through the supply chains) to build a Space Launch System, and no single human can hold all that information in their mind. However, large human organizations come with significant downsides, sometimes due to incentive differences between the leader of the organization's goals and that of portions of their team, sometimes due to the limited capability of the leaders themselves who are after all human and cannot foresee the future, or may even be playing political games if they are more interested in maintaining leadership than in accomplishing the stated goals of the organization. This is why for instance large organizations have a very hard time innovating -- the upside for a potential innovator for undertaking a risky project is overwhelmed by the perceived downside if the project fails in the eyes of their manager. Most people are content to receive a salary and are risk averse, since most of the benefits from a major innovation would not accrue to them. This is also why creative people rarely thrive in large organizations, unless special measures are taken to shield them from the bureaucratic incentive structure (special innovation labs etc). Now imagine that you can build a human-like mind (a goal-oriented mind), but can expand the attention and reality manipulation capabilities without limit. Imagine an entire research or industrial complex run by a single vast mind with thousands of versatile manipulators. With proper protocols and subroutines, there would be no miscommunication, and a properly scaled decision maker could be aware of all the relevant factors available to the entity. Such an entity could be vastly more proficient at a particular task than any human organization. Seems fabulous, right? So what are some potential downsides? Well, if the organization does not have a clearly definable goal (i.e. it doesn't exactly know what it wants to do at the outset) the peculiarities of its problem-solving and pattern-detection algorithms might prevent it from seeing solutions that other differently designed minds mind find obvious. So, ask yourself. Does the solution to whatever the organization is trying to accomplish require combining multiple perspective and thinking outside the box? If so, having multiple minds will bring an advantage. Does the solution lend itself to the kind of scaling a super-human (but human-like) mind might be able to accomplish. Would a human-like mind somehow capable of controlling a thousand hands do it about a thousand times faster? If so, having a single unified entity might be a superior solution. 

Scarcity problems and computing power limitations The way I see it the main limitation towards limitless expansion of capacity right now lies with miniaturization and power consumption. We will have uses for near-AGIs as soon as they can exist, so the first near-AGIs will be pushing the envelope in terms of resources needed: That could mean one of two things: 1) The android's "brain" controller is actually not on scene, and thus subject to speed of light delay and signal interference. Imagine your robot police reluctant to follow the suspects into the mineshaft or the Faraday caged building before setting out a durable com relay network along the way. 2) High power usage. With a handful super-empowered AIs and cybrids running the world's financial systems and running their extravagant kit on Gigawatts of power, electricity is expensive for baseline humans and lower-level AIs as well, while new power plants take years to build, which is slow compared to how fast things are moving in the AI field. 

Such weapons exist and are called thermobaric bombs. They do rely on chemical reactions to trigger the overpressure blast though. Oh, and it doesn't blast out just the windows, the walls too... Sorry about that. A thermobaric explosive works by having the initial blast spread fuel in the targeted area, and then a secondary charge ignites the cloud. This achieves a longer burn and much higher temperatures than a regular plastic explosive. In doing do the high temperatures end up creating a devastating overpressure wave that does most of the damage. This is particularly effective in closed areas such as caves, bunkers or buildings. How does this work? Well, the easiest clue is the ideal gas law:
