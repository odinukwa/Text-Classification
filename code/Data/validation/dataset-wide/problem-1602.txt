The mass media appears to provide unrealistic portrayals of the human body. Does that contribute to the number of cases of anorexia nervosa or other eating disorders? 

The Suzuki method is influenced by the violinist Suzuki's observations of how children learn to speak their mother tongue. Some of the characteristics of the method are 

I've seen quite a few of these "tongue maps", showing discrete borders between taste zones and often conflicting setups, like these two: 

In the hidden-camera clip BEHIND THE VEIL: Never-Before-Seen Footage of Secret Mormon Temple Rituals we supposedly see never-before-seen footage of secret Mormon Temple rituals. A longer version of the Endowment Ceremony is also avaliable. While it might be hard to establish if these particular movies are genuine, is the movie an accurate representation of Mormon "secret" rituals? 

A common trope in popular culture regarding psychopaths is that they are above average to extremely intelligent. Granted, smart psychopaths make for a more interesting villain (or anti-heroes), but this seems to be a common assumption even in reality. In The Mask of Sanity (5th ed.), Dr. Hervey Milton Cleckley claims (p. 339): 

While the immediate effect of increasing focus at the expense of "lightness" is well established, there seem to be no studies supporting long-term vision improvement. In fact, companies selling this product in the United States are not allowed to claim any long-term effect due to the lack of formal clinical studies. According to Casewatch: 

Several online forums I've frequented have had discussions removed when suicide methods are mentioned. The reasoning have been that discussion about suicide themselves are suicide triggers. While it sounds plausible, and it's not that hard to find anecdotes, is there any research confirming that sentiment? Clarification: If you frequent suicide forums you are exposed to a constant stream of suicide information, so naturally that could probably give you that extra push if you are prone to self-destructive behavior. My questions is not about suicide websites or forums dedicated to suicide methods, who naturally attract people contemplating suicide, but whether discussion about suicide in other contexts also function as triggers. Example: On a nutrition forum, it's not unheard of threads shifting to discussing toxicity, and then someone mentions cases of suicide by overdosing on a compound. Are you justified in fearing trigger effects even in this context? 

Anecdotally, I can feel all tastes all over the tongue, more or less equally well, so I don't really understand what these map are supposed to indicate. Does the tongue have different taste zones as shown? 

The evidence can be found here. You just need to translate the article if you do not understand dutch. In vers 9 of this soera Allah made the promise that the quran will remain the same for ever! In vers 41 and 42 of soera 41 you can find the same message. Allah was/is aware that people will ask these questions thats why he did gave answers! You can not edit the quran because it has always been memorized, during the time of the prophet (p.b.u.h) and all the time till today. In the future it will be memorized as well by the will of Allah. Your question refers to the period 'since Muhammad (p.b.u.h)' but I can tell you that the quran was there way before the prophet was born! This has been mentioned in vers 22 of this soera 85 You can find some explanation of this vers over here. Maybe this will help: The Prophet, peace be upon him, recited and memorized the verses after each revelation and then presented the verses to his companions. They also memorized it and at the same time they learned the verses to their families who in turn learned the verses by heart. In addition to the memorization of the Quran the verses were secured by writing the verses and adding them to the correct chapter directly after a revelation by the literate companions. The writings, however, were not yet bundled together, because the Quran was still in the making, so that the existing chapters became longer and sometimes new chapters were added to the whole. In the end, 6,236 verses were revealed between the year 609 and 632 and the final Quran has 114 chapters. To ensure that the verses remained authentic, Allah ordered the Gabriel to repeat all revealed verses every year during the month of Ramadan. During the Ramadan of the year 632 the whole Quran was recited again but in a different setting. Gabriel first began by reciting all the verses to the Prophet, peace be upon him, then it was the Prophet's turn, peace be upon him, to recite the entire Qur'an in the presence of the archangel Gabriel. The Prophet, peace be upon him, died in 632 and in the same year Abu Bakr as-Siddiq was appointed as the first caliph. During his caliphate, the entire quran was written down for the first time and collected in a single book. This first version was based on the memorization of different individuals and on the texts written by the companions at an earlier stage. The companions used a very strict authentication and verification process to compile the first quran. After being convinced of the authenticity of the bundled copy, the first written quran was kept in the house of Abu Bakr. This caliph however died in the year 634 after which the book was transferred to the house of the second caliph, Omar ibn al-Chattab. He stayed there until he died. Then in the year 644 the original quran was transferred to the house of the daughter of Omar, Ḥafsa bint Omar. This was kept by her until the third Caliph, Uthman ibn Affan, requested the original copy. During the Caliphate of Uthman, the Muslim community grew explosively. Converts to Islam were not only found on the Arabian Peninsula but also beyond. Although this was a positive development, Uthman began to worry about the translations of the quran in the various Arabic dialects. The companions traveled throughout the Arab Empire and noticed that in some parts of Iraq, for example, the Quran verses were recited differently than they had learned. At the time the caliph was informed about this, he realized that this was not a good development. He was of the opinion that the authenticity of the quran was at stake. To stop this development, he ordered the destruction of all translations of the quran, written in another Arabic dialect. At the same time copies of the original quran, which was kept by Ḥafsa bint Omar, were distributed among the Muslims. Since then nothing has been changed to the quran. some more info: Those that have memorized the quran very well, have learned it on the traditional way (like in the days of phorphet p.b.u.h.). They write the quran on a wooden tablet with a handmade pen and ink. I have done it as well! You start with writing a part of the soera learn it and then you will be heard by the imam/master. After finising the complete quran, you start from the beginning again by writing, learing and hearing by imam (the imam is also checking the spelling during the first time!). You need to repeat this at least 5 times and there are also those that have repeated it more then 20 times. When you have done this you can say that you have memorized the quran, because when you start reciting the quran its like you see a mirror in front of you with the texts. This is the reason the quran version has not been changed. I do not think one can prove that the quran of today is the same as the first one with literature or other kind of evidence. But when you understand how the quran is being memorized then I think you will start accepting that there is only one version. If one is reciting quran incorrectly next to a person that has memorized it, he/she will correct him/her at the same time! Conclusion is that the quran has been perserved by those that have memorized it! $URL$ 

There is little limited research on if/how Gripe Water works. This literature review from 2000 looks at the evidence of how Gripe Water deals with colic (which may or may not be caused by intestinal discomfort): 

So, there have been mixed results from studies, but the Swiss study seems to be more statistically sound than the earlier attempts, and despite its large size, it found no evidence for nuclear power plants causing childhood cancers. 

These aren't the most definitive sources, but this doesn't seem like the sort of question that will be studied in a lab; my search for scientific sources was fruitless. 

It seems those who have a greater burden of guilt may find it more difficult, not less difficult to sleep. (I have only read the abstract to this paper, and it did not contain enough info to confirm the result.) 

This prospective study in the UK found a serious risk of neonatal necrotising enterocolitis amongst formula-users. 

In summary: the answer didn't come from the original paper, and is far more complicated than the newspaper might suggest with its cherry-picked anecdotes. The relationship between well-being and obesity is culturally dependent and socioeconomically dependent; an inverse association (and stigma) appears in Western countries, while a positive association exists Russia. There is a relationship between depression and obesity in the USA, and seems to be more likely to run from obesity to depression. There is an inverse association between obesity and suicide, despite the depression figures the other way. 

I am answering the current version of the question, which asks: 'Did Robert Putnam publish a study that found that diversity has "incredibly negative consequences"?' Robert Putnam did publish: 

Source. So, the claim that Sodium Fluoride was only used as rat poison prior to 1938 is false. Prior Art in Science The 1952 book A Survey of the Literature of Dental Caries by the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Research Council shows that there was a lot of literature already existing by the beginning of the 1950s. 

This is known as the Giant Impact Hypothesis or the "Big Splash". As remarkable as it sounds, it is actually is the scientific consensus of how the moon was formed. 

They go on to defend their hypothesis, but admit that standard clinical measurements of periodontal disease show no associations. (Instead, they recommend measuring antibody responses.) Again, their claims are heavily qualified. Conclusion There has been some interesting research tentatively suggesting that periodontal disease is closely correlated to coronary heart disease, with a mechanism proposed. That research has been criticised and (as of 2005), the science hadn't reached a consensus. Roizen published a popular health book in 2000 (which spawned a series of books and a web-site business) that claimed periodontal disease could cause an elevated risk of coronary heart disease, without considering the confounding factors. He made the leap that flossing would therefore reduce the risk. His book was promoted on Oprah and gained widespread attention from dental web-sites, but it was widely criticized by scientists as being exaggerated.
