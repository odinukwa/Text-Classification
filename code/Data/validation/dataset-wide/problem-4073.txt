I am looking for a reference to show how to obtain a priori estimate of the solution $u\in H^1$ and $u\in C^{2,\alpha}$ to the diffraction problem of linear elliptic equation. I looked at Ladyzhenskaya's book (section 3.16), but it only has a priori estimate for $u\in H^2$ and confirms the existence of a Holder solution. Gilbarg and Trudinger book has both estimates but not for the diffraction problem. Edit: The equation I'm considering is \begin{equation} \begin{cases} Lu & = & f & \mbox{in } \Omega \\ u & = & 0 & \mbox{on } \partial\Omega \\ [u]\vert_\Gamma & = & 0 \\ \partial_s(\alpha^{st}\partial_tu) + \left.\left[\displaystyle \frac{\partial u}{\partial N} \right]\right\rvert_\Gamma & = & g \end{cases} \end{equation} I assume $\Gamma$ is $x_n=0$, $[u]$ is a jump condition (I took this notation from Ladyzhenskaya's book), and $\displaystyle \frac{\partial u}{\partial N}$ is the co-normal derivative of $u$. $\Omega$ is an infinite strip. $Lu = \partial_i(a^{ij}\partial_j u) + b^i\partial_i u + cu$ $a^{ij}, b^i, c, \alpha^{st}, f, g$ are functions of $x$. 

I'm looking for a reference showing how to obtain a priori estimate for solutions to a linear second-order elliptic equation with Wentzell boundary condition in a bounded domain in $H^1$ space. The problem I'm considering is \begin{equation}\begin{cases} Lu = \partial_i(a^{ij}\partial_j u) + b^i\partial_i u + cu & = & f &\mbox{in } \Omega \\ Bu = \alpha^{st}D_{st}u + \beta^sD_su+\gamma u & = & g &\mbox{on } \partial\Omega \end{cases}\end{equation} Thank you. 

I'm considering the diffraction problem described in section 3.16 of "Linear and quasilinear elliptic equations" of Ladyzhenskaya and Uraltseva (1968). Let $\Omega$ be an open bounded subset in $\mathbb{R}^n$, and suppose the surface $\Gamma$ partition $\Omega$ into sub-regions $\Omega_1$ and $\Omega_2$ where $\Omega = \Omega_1 \cup \Omega_2$. For simplicity, I assume $\Gamma$ to be the surface $\{x_n=0\}$. Now suppose $u(x)$ satisfies the following condition in $\Omega_1$ and $\Omega_2$ \begin{equation} Lu \equiv \partial_{x_i} (a^{ij}(x) \partial_{x_j}u) + b^i(x) \partial_{x_i}u + c(x) u = f(x) \quad (16.1) \end{equation} and the conditions \begin{equation} u|_{\partial\Omega} = 0, \quad [u]|_\Gamma = 0, \quad \left.\left[ \frac{\partial u}{\partial N} \right]\right|_\Gamma = 0 \quad (16.3) \end{equation} on $\partial\Omega$ and $\Gamma$. Here the symbol $[v]|_\Gamma$ denotes the jump in the function $v$ as it crosses $\Gamma$. Also, $\displaystyle \left.\frac{\partial u}{\partial N} \right|_\Gamma = a^{ij} (\partial_{x_j}u) \cos(n, x_i)$, where $n$ is the normal to $\Gamma$. $u \in H^1_0(\Omega)$ is a weak solution of the problem (16.1) and (16.3) if $u$ satisfies \begin{equation} \int_\Omega \left[ a^{ij}(\partial_{x_j}u) (\partial_{x_i}v) -b^i (\partial_{x_i}u) v - cuv \right] \,dx = - \int_\Omega fv \,dx \quad (16.5) \end{equation} for all $v \in H^1_0(\Omega)$. Assume boundedness of the coefficients $a^{ij}, \partial_{x_k}a^{ij}, b^i, c$, the uniformly elliptic condition, and $f \in L^{q/2}(\Omega)$ for $q > n$. Suppose we already showed $u \in H^2(\Omega_i)$. In (16.5), take $v(x) = \partial_{x_s} \eta$ for $s \le n-1$, where $\eta$ is a sufficiently smooth function with compact support in $K_\rho$, where $K_\rho$ is a sphere inside $\Omega$ with center on $\Gamma$. Let $\Gamma_1 := K_\rho \cap \Gamma$. Substituting into (16.5) and integrating by parts we get \begin{equation} \int_\Omega \left[ a^{ij} (\partial_{x_s}\partial_{x_j}u) (\partial_{x_i}\eta) + \partial_{x_s} a^{ij} (\partial_{x_j}u) (\partial_{x_i}\eta) + b^i (\partial_{x_i}u) (\partial_{x_s}\eta) + cu(\partial_{x_s}\eta) \right] \,dx = \int_\Omega f (\partial_{x_s} \eta) \,dx. \quad (16.13) \end{equation} The author stated "On the basis of the conditions (16.13), we have $\left.[\partial_{x_s}u] \right|_{\Gamma_1} = 0$ for $s \le n-1$. I don't understand why it is the case. I'm new to this type and really want to understand it. Thank you. EDIT: Following John Jiang's comment, I did the computation out. Substituting $v = \partial_{x_s} \eta$ into (16.5) and integrating by parts the first term, we get (justifying derivatives of $u$ makes sense) \begin{equation} \int_{K_\rho} \left[ -\partial_{x_s}(a^{ij}\partial_{x_j}u)(\partial_{x_i}\eta) - b^i(\partial_{x_i}u)(\partial_{x_s}\eta) - cu(\partial_{x_s}\eta) \right] \,dx + \int_{\Gamma_1} \big[a^{ij}(\partial_{x_j}u)(\partial_{x_i}\eta)\big]\Big|_\Gamma \,dS = -\int_{K_\rho} f(\partial_{x_s}\eta) dx. \end{equation} The integral over $\Gamma_1$ vanishes by the hypothesis that $\displaystyle \left.\left[ \frac{\partial u}{\partial N} \right]\right|_\Gamma = 0$. However, I haven't seen why the tangential derivatives of $u$ across $\Gamma_1$, $[\partial_{x_s}u]|_{\Gamma_1}$ must be 0. 

It follows from Weil's rigidity theorem $URL$ that given any uniform lattice in $SU(n,1)$ with $n>1,$ it has no local deformations, in fact no non-trivial first order deformations. If $n=1$ then the the symmetric space is the real hyperbolic plane and there is a large family of deformations for surface groups. Now, if you don't require the lattice condition, then there may or may not be deformations. The case of a surface group is the most well understood (to me at least). It is a theorem of Toledo that a discrete surface group (here surface means closed, oriented and genus at least two) in $SU(2,1)$ which stabilizes a totally geodesic holomorphic hyperbolic plane in $\mathbb{CH}^2$ is locally rigid. But, surfaces groups which stabilize a totally real lagrangian hyperbolic plane in $\mathbb{CH}^2$ admit many deformations, these are so-called complex hyperbolic quasi-Fuchsian groups and their deformations are still far from well understood. Maybe Misha Kapovich (who posts here and is an expert) might add some more interesting comments at some point. 

Then, given any family of such structures over a pointed base $(B, b_{0}),$ there exists a Kodaira-Spencer map $KS: T_{b_{0}}B\rightarrow \mathbb{H}^{1}(X, \mathcal{A}^{\bullet}).$ Furthermore, if Condition A is satisfied, then there exists an open neighborhood $B$ of $0\in Ob^{-1}(0)$ and a versal family over $B$ giving a (germ of a) deformation of the structure on $X.$ Before closing, let me remark that while very powerful, for the scope of this question I'm not interested in algebraic techniques (say when $X$ is a projective) which circumvent this issue by constructing a global moduli space (or stack...). In particular, this problem probably can't be solved using geometric invariant theory, or any of the other standard techniques in algebraic geometry. I am insisting we stay in the category of complex manifolds, or perhaps the larger category of complex analytic spaces. I can go into more detail about the kind of problems I'm interested in, but to save space, let me stop for now and leave the question as it stands. I appreciate any references or insights anyone may have. 

This seems to have nothing to do with Kahler manifolds, at least not how you have stated it. Any $C^{\infty}$-complex vector bundle over a paracompact smooth manifold admits a Hermitian metric, by employing a partition of unity. The imaginary part of this Hermitian metric is a skew-symmetric, non-degenerate bilinear form on each fiber which makes that complex vector bundle into a symplectic vector bundle. 

Suppose $(X,I)$ is an almost-complex real analytic manifold where $I$ is a real-analytic almost complex structure. Suppose there exists an $I$-almost complex submanifold $M\subset X$ where this means that $M$ is a real analytic submanifold such that given a tangent vector $v$ to $M,$ then $I(v)$ is also tangent to $M.$ Suppose that the restriction of $I$ to $M$ is integrable. The question is: are there conditions under which this implies that $I$ is integrable on all of $X?$ I would be supremely surprised if the condition was empty, namely that this always implied that $I$ was integrable, although I wouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth. Nevertheless, a condition such as the restriction of $I$ to $M$ being Stein, or something of such a global nature, doesn't sound quite so ridiculous. I should add that in the exact situation I'm considering, $X$ is non-compact (it's topologically a ball) and $M$ is non-compact (also topologically a ball) and the restriction of $I$ to $M$ is Stein, and lots of other nice things you might dream it to be as a complex manifold. Edit: I've just realized that I need to add that $M$ is not of complex dimension one, otherwise the integrability of $I$ restricted to $M$ is a trivial consequence of there being no $(2,0)$-forms on $M.$ Thanks for any comments or ideas you might have.

The points in $S_X(n)$ come from $(x,y)$ with $x^2 \equiv \mp 1$ (mod $y$), so the problem is about the distribution of the values of $\pm x^3 + x$ mod $y^2$ for all $0 < x < y$ satisfying $x^2 \equiv \mp 1$ (mod $y$). Trivially, $S_X(n)$ can be replaced by 

I am working on the distribution of class numbers of real quadratic fields, and reduced the problem to something about a family of cubic modular equations I have not seen before. The situation is this: Let $n$ be a large positive integer, and define $S_X(n)$ $:=$ { $(x,y) \in \mathbb{Z}^2 : 0 < x < y < X,\ (x,y)=1,\ \pm x^3 + x \equiv 2ny$ (mod $y^2$) }. The problem is to find the least $X = X(n,r)$ for which the number of elements of $S_X(n)$ becomes greater than $2rn$ for $0 < r < 1$ (or to find a lower bound of $X(n,r)$ on average with respect to $n$). A very naive but somewhat reasonable guess is that $log(X(n,r)) >> rn$ for almost all $n$. Is there any reference or typical technique to handle this? p.s. 

$S'_X(n)$ $:=$ { $(x,y,\xi) \in \mathbb{Z}^3 : 0 < x < y < X,\ (x,y)=1,\ \xi y^2 - 2ny = \pm x^3 - x $}. so it seems that a family of elliptic curves appears in this problem (though it is not in a familiar standard form) and the distribution of the smallest integral points of these curves have something to do with class numbers; the larger the least integral points of the curves in $S'_X(n)$, the smaller the class numbers of real quadratic fields. 

The question is this; is there a complete characterization of all the f-vectors of regular triangulations? (other names for this can be: Delaunay triangulation, coherent triangulation, convex triangulation, Gale triangulation, or something else. It means the lower faces of a simplicial polytope.) A brief history is this. For each polytopal complex $\mathcal{C}$, its f-vector is defined by $\overrightarrow{f}(\mathcal{C}) = (f_{-1},f_0,f_1,\cdots,f_{d-1})$ where $f_i$ is the number of $i$-faces of $\mathcal{C}$. An auxiliary vector $\overrightarrow{h}(\mathcal{C}) = (h_0,h_1,\cdots,h_d)$ which is a linear transform of $\overrightarrow{f}(\mathcal{C})$ carries the same information as $\overrightarrow{f}(\mathcal{C})$. The Euler-Poincare formula is the only nontrivial linear equation that is satisfied by all f-vectors of the boundary complexes $\partial\mathcal{P}$ of $d$-polytopes $\mathcal{P}$ in general. If we confine ourselves to simplicial $d$-polytopes only, the famous Dehn-Sommerville equations are satisfied, which can be formulated in terms of h-vectors as \begin{equation*} h_k = h_{d-k} \text{ for $k=0,1,\cdots,d$.} \end{equation*} An immediate question is about its converse, i.e., characterizing all the possible f-vectors. There are famous results in this direction: 

The first two theorems say that any vector $\overrightarrow{a}$ can be the f-vector of some shellable simplicial complex whenever the sizes of $a_{-1},a_0,\cdots,a_{d-1}$ are 'reasonable'. ('reasonable' means that the h-vector should be an M-sequence or O-sequence.) The third one basically says that the size constraint(being M-sequence) and Dehn-Sommerville equations characterize the f-vectors of (boundaries of) simplicial polytopes completely. Therefore, in an expository manner we may write \begin{equation*} \frac{\{\text{shellable simplicial complexes} \}}{\partial(\{ \text{simplicial polytopes} \})} \sim \text{Dehn-Sommerville}. \end{equation*} My question is the analogue of this; \begin{equation*} \frac{\{\text{shellable simplicial complexes} \}}{\{ \text{regular triangulations} \}} \sim \;? \end{equation*} I've been searching for this, but nothing in this direction appeared to me.
