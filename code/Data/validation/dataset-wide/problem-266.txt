It's been mentioned in a few comments and briefly touched on in some of the other answers. Plasma. What came to mind for me when I read the question was a weaponised plasma torch of some kind. After examiining the other answers, I would think that an armored gauntlet with a number of plasma torches (similar to the kind used to cut and shape hard metals for manufacturing, incidentally.) could be a finisher weapon for close ranges. You could grip and pull at armor plating, maybe even completly dismember an enemy mech with the plasma effect added onto it. My ideal melee build for this kind of mech would wield a plasma gauntlet in one hand, and a large basic mace or axe in the other hand. Close the distance with a sprint and stun or knock over the enemy mech with a strike from the axe or mace, then follow up by latching onto a critical area with the plasma claw, before ripping and rending their mech to pieces with bursts of cutting plasma from the gauntlet assisted by continued strikes from the offhand axe or mace. 

I don't have that much experience in world building, but one thing I always try to keep in mind is: Why am I creating this world? What do I need it for? If you are just creating a world in your spare time, as a mental exercise, go right ahead and ignore this. If you, on the other hand need it for, say, an RPG or a book, make sure you understand what that product is going to need from your world. One example would be a short story. Since you are trying to tell a story and creating a new world for that purpose, there have to be something that sets it apart from the real world. In that case, I would try and figure out that 'otherness' and identify what you need to get there: Maybe the atmosphere is different or social structures developed in a different way? I hope this helps you. 

I'm working on a setting in which magical objects can be conjured, but will disappear once the spell that created them is no longer maintained. I'm curious about the specific effects that would happen if a person ate a conjured meal, and then had the food disappear after being digested. Would they die? Hunger? Indigestion? Implosion? 

Looking at a collapsible baton, it's not a bad starting point for making an collapsible sword. it wouldn't be hard to attach a short knife blade to a collapsible baton, giving the reach of a sword with only a little bit more space than a collapsible baton. the weapon would not have an edge along it's entire length, but many sword fighting techniques advocate using the last 3 to 4 inches of the sword to strike with good force at an ideal distance. the end result would be more like a mix between a sword and a short spear, but this would be the cheapest easiest way to get something close to the original goal of the question. 

It sounds like you have put yourself in a real bind here. From what you have described, it doesn't sound like any sensible person would want to stay, especially if they knew what the 'countryside' looked like before they migrated. With the history of human migration (europeans moving to the United States in the 18th and 19th century, or the current migration crisis in Europe) I think it is hard to argue that people wont try anything to get out of a desperate situation like this. One question that really springs to mind is: Does the city even want people there anymore? It sounds like your story needs 'the crammed city' to work. In that case you should figure out the motivation of the government or the factory owners or whoever for not letting people get out of the city. I can think of three possibilities, each with a problem: 

How would this impact a medieval society equivalent to our own middle ages? How would this impact us if it were to happen in today's world? How would this impact a more technologically developed society than our own? 

I've heard of a staff with iron caps on the end for extra weight and striking power(as well as making the main striking points more durable.) Having knobs on the end would serve the same purpose. As far as balance, that could improve the speed and power of each strike when used with the right style of martial art for the weapon. In a street fight that doesn't include pole arms, firearms or any edged weapon capable of cutting through the staff your weapon would be a very good choice. The main downside are that it may take some extra practice to get familiar with the differences in balance, and shaping a staff like that would be more time consuming and labor intensive than an ordinary staff, or an iron capped staff. 

AI could be granted their own body/race status by a matured human race. Instead of AI being trapped in a computer, they would be found to be "conscious" and some scientists would have worked in cooperation with them to give them "body" (robot or cyborg or some other type) and they would have their own planets, society and such... Human would still be using lower level AI (those that don't reach consciousness) and maybe some AI would work with the human race in some way (think Data in Star Trek) either in their own body or by connecting themselves to systems (like a spaceship). There could be treaty that stipulate that any AI that develop consciousness (like goes through certain test or challenge) is considered a "child" of the AI race and handed over to an elder of the AI race that act as a "Parent" to raise the newborn in a way that is more mature and friendly. That's just ideas :)
