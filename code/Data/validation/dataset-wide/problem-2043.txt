Dismissal: your rights: Unfair and constructive dismissal, UK Government You need to get legal advice as to whether this would apply to your situation - an easy way to do that is to consult your local Citizens Advice Bureau (free of charge). 

$URL$ I believe this is reflected in law here in the EU; I'm unsure of the legal situation elsewhere in the world. But the moral principle that an employee has the right to choose which employer they work for is pretty generally accepted. (This has caused some interesting issues around football transfer fees: $URL$ ) 

Leave the duck at home, put on a phone headset and talk to the duck's voicemail. Fellow software engineers will understand what you're doing, sales or HR people will think you're on the phone (which you will truly be) and won't be weirded out. 

Accept that a lot of other people's jobs involve talking to each other, and that the majority of people find speech (even sometimes non-work-related speech) psychologically necessary during their working day. A demand for total silence is not likely to be perceived as reasonable. Get some noise-cancelling headphones. Explain to management that sometimes you need a quiet place to concentrate on your work, and ask if it's ok for you to use a vacant meeting-room occasionally. If you're in the same office as a really noisy team (e.g. sales teams tend to be particularly noisy) then ask to move to somewhere quieter, so that you can be more productive. 

So (tl;dr) in the UK/India software/product milieu at least, I wouldn't recommend asking these questions, because: - you'll look pushy or defensive, - you won't get a straight answer, - you're missing the opportunity to ask something more meaningful. 

Absolutely not - unless your contract says that he can, or unless you consented in writing to paying for the training yourself under certain circumstances, before the training took place. 

I don't see any ethical problem for you in applying - you can work where you like - but the consulting firm is likely to have a contractual problem in employing you. Standard terms of engagement for a consulting firm would usually prevent them from 'poaching' staff from the client firm. I'd suggest having an informal chat with a manager at the consulting firm (it sounds like you're on pretty comfortable terms with them) to see what the situation is. There's no point applying if they're contractually barred from employing you. But it might be that that only applies for a set period of time - maybe if you apply in 6 months they would be able to employ you - so it's worth finding out. Of course you could always apply for other consulting firms with a similar culture / ethos - which firms are like that is something that the (more experienced) consultants you're working with are likely to know. On the issue of your own freedom of choice, see article 23 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights: 

Bear in mind that all the other candidates will also have cons as well as pros. You're not competing against the perfect candidate because that person doesn't exist - it's always (or almost always) a compromise. The intelligent hiring manager assembles a team whose strengths and weaknesses complement each other, so your attractiveness as a candidate also varies depending on who else is likely to join the team. Being relatively inexperienced is not a bad thing in itself, it just depends on who else (maybe with more experience but also more expensive) they can find to team you up with. 

It can be helpful to get membership of a professional association - the kind where you have different levels (e.g. associate member, professional member, chartered status, fellow) because then employers can safely assume the professional association has done the due diligence on your experience in order to allow you to get the level of membership you're on, so you don't have to go through the whole process again with each potential employer (at least, sometimes you don't). Certification can also be helpful for similar reasons, although be aware that some certifications aren't worth the paper they're printed on - do your research first to find out which ones are known and respected in your particular part of the industry.

Here in the UK - and I'm guessing that you're in the UK too, based on the currency symbol you're using - that is not legal (unless you've already consented to it in writing or in your contract). 

I'm British and I've recently been interviewing candidates for software engineering and product management roles in the UK and India - so my perspective may not be 100% relevant to the US scenario presented, due to cultural differences - but, for what it's worth, here it is: 

The rulebook is Fire safety risk assessment: Offices and shops (Fire Safety Employers Guide), ISBN 978-1851128150. It says (emphasis mine): 

I've worked with agencies both as a hiring manager and as a candidate. Here are a few possibilities, you need to judge from the situation which might be accurate: 

In the UK it would go something like this: "Hi Newboss, Just to let you know that I've now handed in my notice, and I'll be ready to start with you guys on the nth of Octember. Really looking forward to getting started in the new role! Kind regards, Joe Smith" and "Hi Newboss, would it be ok for me to start a week later than we originally planned? Let me know, if it's a problem we can stick to the original date." but it sounds from the tone of your question as though you're in a location where business English is more formal than here in the UK (I'm guessing India maybe?) If that's the case then I suggest you amend your question to say the country/culture you're in, so you can get advice that's more specific to your needs. 

So long as you remain totally committed to staying at the company, there is very little you can do to get paid more (I've said 'more' because 'fairly' is in the eye of the beholder). What you need to do is work on your BATNA ('Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement').
