Wilkie's proof of o-minimality of exponentiation tells you (without needing to assume Schanuel's Conjecture) that for each $k$ there is a bound $M_k$ such that any exponential polynomial $\sum_{i=1}^k c_ie^{\alpha_i x}$ has at most $M_k$ real zeros [assuming that the $c_i$ and $\alpha_i$ are real.] Perhaps Khovanskii's work gives an explicit bound on the $M_k$. 

We will always have ${\rm ZF}^M\supseteq {\rm ZF}$. The problem comes if $M$ contains nonstandard sentences--which is equivalent to the question of whether $M$ contains nonstandard natural numbers since we can identify formulas with their Godel codes. If there are no nonstandard integers, then they type of externl induction you are doing works fine, but if there aren't it might break down at a nonstandard stage. 

The classical example is ${\mathbf\Pi}^1_1$ sets of reals. We say that $X\subset \mathbb R$ is ${\mathbf\Pi}^1_1$ if the complement of the projection of a Borel set in ${\mathbb R}^n$. Any such set of cardinality greater than $\aleph_1$ has cardinality continuum. 

Some definitions: Let $(M,d)$, $(M',d')$ be metric spaces. For $f:M\to M'$, $x\in M$ and $r>0$, define $$D_r(f)(x):= \sup\{r^{-1}d'(f(x),f(y)): y\in M,\,d(x,y)\leq r\}.$$ Define the pointwise Lipschitz constant of $f$ at $x\in M$ as $\text{Lip}(f)(x):=\limsup_{r\to 0} D_r(f)(x)$, and say $f$ is pointwise Lipschitz at $x$, if $\text{Lip}(f)(x)<\infty$. My question is the following: 

The answer is that the reflexivity assumption cannot be dropped. The following simple example (due to Tony Wickstead) is a 1-normal non-reflexive space with closed and generating cone, where there exists a pair of elements without minimal upper bound: 

A characterization doesn't seem to exist, but Batty & Robinson does give one necessary condition to have this property. 

For the representations of abelian and compact groups we can go through the motions and show that this is indeed the case without ever needing to resort to this isomorphism of categories (take a look at the Peter-Weyl theorem for compact groups on wikipedia). However, for a unitary representation on a seperable Hilbert space of a separable non-abelian, non-compact, locally compact groups things become more difficult but still works. To get a result, the rough idea is as follows: We transfer everything to the category of representations of $C^\ast (G)$, and invoke von Neumann algebra theory to show that every such representation can be written as a "direct integral" of irreducibles and then transfer back to the category of group representations to conclude that every such unitary group representation can be reduced to a direct integral of irreducables. Details are in Chapter 14 of "Real reductive groups. II" by Nolan R. Wallach UPDATE: As Yemon pointed out things are not as simple as first thought, and what I remembered reading in Wallach is not what I actually read. 

Pillay and Scanlon gave an example showing Morley rank isn't definable in elementary extensions in: Compact complex manifolds with the DOP and other properties, J. Symbolic Logic, vol. 67 (2002), pp. 737–743. In a different direction Dale Radin showed the you do have definability of dimension in the standard model in: A definability result for compact complex spaces. J. Symbolic Logic vol. 69 (2004), pp. 241–254. 

As I recall, McAloon's method for proving that there are no computable nonstandard models of $I\Delta_0$ was to show that there are initial segments that are nonstandard models of PA. The usual Tennenbaum tricks can then be used to show that addition and multiplication are not computable. Additional Comment-- Here are references for McAloon's paper and the paper of Wilmers that proves a similar result for $IE_1$ the fragment of $I\Delta_0$ where you only have induction for formulas with bounded existential quantifiers McAloon, Kenneth, On the complexity of models of arithmetic.

Since your questions refers to infinite dimensional spaces and not specifically to Banach spaces, it might interest you that there are positive results for locally convex spaces. These all to a certain extent rely on the fact that in general lcs's, in contrast to Banach spaces, (for example, in Montel spaces or reflexive Banach spaces with the weak topology), one can have large compact sets. The main principle behind the results is that in the presence of compactness one can employ the finite dimensional case by reducing to projective limits of spectra of finite dimensional spaces. One possible reference is the Studia Math. paper of K. Astala "On Peano's theorem in locally convex spaces, 73 (1982), 214-223. 

The answer in the second case is even easier. In order to avoid circularity, define the Stieltjes transform of a measure only on the complex plane minus the real axis . Then the measure has support in a compact interval if and only if this transform has an analytic continuous over the real axis outside of this interval. This has suitable generalisations to bounded measures (i.e., with not necessarily compact support) and even to distributions where it is a kingpin of the theory of distributions as boundary values of analytic functions (Köthe, Tillmann et. al). 

The theory of the natural numbers with addition and $x\mapsto 2^x$ is decidable. One reference is the Cherlin-Point paper "On extensions of Presburger arithmetic". It can be found on Francoise Point's webpage: $URL$ 

This doesn't exactly answer your question but... If $A$ is any upper bound for the arithmetic degrees then $0^{(\omega)}$ is recursive in $A^{\prime\prime}$. Enderton and Putnam proved that there upper bounds with $A^{\prime\prime}=0^{(\omega)} $ Dave 

This was intended to be a comment to SJR's post, but was too long. Here is a proof that any formula that is preserved downwards in models of $T$ is equivalent in $T$ to a universal formula, from which we deduce that formulas preserved upwards are equivalent to existential formulas. Let $T$ be an $\cal L$-theory. Suppose $\phi(\bar v)$ is preserved downwards in models of $T$. Let $\Gamma(\bar v)=\{\psi(\bar v): \psi$ is universal and $T\models \phi(\bar v)\rightarrow \psi(\bar v)\}$. We claim that $T+\Gamma(\bar v)\models \psi(\bar v)$. If that happens then there are $\psi_1,\dots,\psi_n\in\Gamma(\bar v)$ such that $T\models \phi(\bar v)\leftrightarrow (\psi_1(\bar v)\land\dots\land\psi_n(\bar v)$. Suppose not. Then there is ${\cal M}\models T$ and $\bar a\in \cal M$ such that ${\cal M}\models \psi(\bar a)$ for $\psi\in\Gamma$ and ${\cal M}\models \neg\phi(\bar a)$. Let $T_1= T+ \phi(\bar a) + $ atomic diagram of $\cal M$. If $T_1$ is satisfiable there is ${\cal N}\models T$ with ${\cal M}\subset {\cal N}$ and ${\cal N}\models \phi(\bar a)$, contradicting the fact that $\phi$ is preserved downward. Thus $T_1$ must be unsatisfiable. Thus there is a quantifier free formula $\theta(\bar v,\bar w)$ and $\bar b\in \cal M$ such that $$T\models \theta(\bar a,\bar b)\rightarrow \neg\phi(\bar a).$$ Since the parameters $\bar a$ and $\bar b$ don't occur in $T$, $$T\models \forall \bar v\ (\phi(\bar v)\rightarrow\forall \bar w\ \neg\theta(\bar v,\bar w))$$ But then $\forall \bar w\ \neg\theta(\bar v,\bar w)\in \Gamma$ contradicting the fact that ${\cal M}\models \theta(\bar a,\bar b)$. 

Let $\alpha>0$ and $X$ be an $\alpha$-normal (meaning, for $x,y\in X$, $0\leq x\leq y$ implies $\|x\|\leq\alpha\|y\|$) ordered Banach space with closed generating cone $X_{+}$. If $X$ is reflexive, then every pair of elements from $X$ has a minimal upper bound, i.e., for $x,y\in X$, there exists some $z\in X$ with $\{x,y\}\leq z$, such that $\{x,y\}\leq w\leq z$ implies $w=z$. One can show this using Zorn's lemma and the fact that order intervals are weakly compact (since they are convex, closed and norm bounded, and the space is reflexive). 

I couldn't see any way of attacking this without reflexivity, so I started thinking about counter examples. Of course, all Banach lattices are immediately disqualified from potential counterexamples. The best hope I had for an example was something like $X:=\mathbb{R}\oplus_{1}C_{0}(\mathbb{R})$ with the (ice-cream) cone $X_{+}:=\{(t,f)\in X:t\geq\|f\|_{\infty}\}$, but every pair of elements turns out to have a minimal upper bound... 

Vi Hart is a master at doing the opposite: Presenting mathematics, which on the surface seems to be aimed at laymen, but is actually aimed at mathematicians in my opinion. Granted, those mathematicians might be young, and may not have realized yet that they actually are mathematicians. This video from her is actually fairly deep, while following Andrej Bauer's 8 suggestions above almost to the letter. 

The classical argument Andres mentions can be taken one step further to show that if every uncountable $\Pi_1^1$ set contains a perfect subset then $\aleph_1$ is inaccessible in $L$. This follows from the same fact for $\Sigma^1_2$-sets since, by the uniformization theorem, every $\Sigma^1_2$-set is the injective projection of a $\Pi^1_1$-set. 

I think the answer is no, but let me first give a precise version of the question (which I think Daniel's argument doesn't quite address). Fix some reasonable listing $P_0,P_1,\dots$ of recursively enumerable sets of polynomials. [See below for a ``reasonable" coding.] I claim that there is no algorithm to determine if $V(P_e)=\emptyset$. Let $K$ be the diagonal halting set. Namely, $K=$ {$e$: the $ e^{\rm th}$ Turing machine halts on input $e$}. For each $e$ let $P_e=\{p_0,p_1,\dots\}$ be the recursively enumerable sequence of polynomials where $p_i=0$ if the $e^{\rm th}$ Turing machine has not halted by stage $i$ and $p_i=1$ if has. Then $V(P_e)=\emptyset \Leftrightarrow e\in K$. Since $K$ is undecidable there is no algorithm to decide if $V(P_e)$ is empty. One way to code sequences of polynomials would be to let $q_0,q_1,\dots$ list all polynomials, and let $P_e$ be {$q_i:$ the $e^{\rm th}$ Turing machine halts on input $i$}. To get to Ian's setting we could view $P_e$ as the sequence $p_0,p_1,\dots$ where $p_{(i,j)\}$ is 0 unless the $e^{\rm th}$ Turing machine halts on input i at stage $j$ in which case it is $q_i$ and $(i,j)$ is some computable pairing function. 

There are certainly many other solutions. Here is a recipe for constructing them. If $S$ is a set (say infinite to simplify the presentation). We split $S$ into a disjoint union of $k$-element subsets $S_\alpha$. On each such subset we consider a cyclic permutation. We then fit them together to a mapping on the whole space. This clearly satisfies your condition. 

The result you mention uses the algebraic structure of euclidean space since it involves a form of uniform approxability of the set and its translates. However, there are many criteria for compactness which dispense with this, e.g., one which involves approximability by conditional expectations rather than translates (see, e.g., p. 295 in Bogachev, Measure Theory, vol. I) and so do not require an algebraic structure on the underlying measure space. There is, in fact, a considerable literature on compactness in $L^p$-spaces which goes back to the 30's. You might want to have a look at a recent article by Krotov in Sb. Math. 203:7 (2010) 129-148 which gives a brief historical summary in the introduction. 

Another way to do this is to use the Hensel-Rychlick version of Hensel's Lemma. This says that if you have $f\in {\mathbb Z}_p[X]$ and $a\in{\mathbb Z}_p$ such that $v(f(a))>2v(f^\prime(a))$, then $f$ has a zero in ${\mathbb Z}_p$. As in Jerome's answer we can find an integer $n$ such that $x=n+p^3\alpha$ where $\alpha$ is a unit. Let $f(X)=X^p-{x\over n}$. Then $v(f(1))=3$ while $v(f^\prime(1))=1$. Thus $x\over n$ has a $p$-th root. Indeed, the Hensel-Rychlick Lemma says you can find a zero $c$ with $v(c-a)\ge v(f(a))-v(f^\prime(a))$. 

This is really a comment, but I need a bit more space. If $\phi$ is a sentence of ${\cal L}_{\omega_1,\omega}$ that is $\aleph_0$-categorial, there is a complete first order theory $T$ in an expanded vocabulary such that the models of $\phi$ are exactly the reducts atomic models of $\phi$. The expansion is done in such a way that two structures will be isomorphic in the original language if and only if they are isomorphic in the expanded language. So your question is really the same as: For $\phi$ a sentence of ${\cal}L_{\omega_1,\omega}$ is ``$\phi$ is $\kappa$-categorical for all infinite $\kappa$" absolute? This is, as far as I know, still an open question. It is also open if ``$\phi$ is $\aleph_1$-categorical" is absolute. John Baldwin in his paper ``Amalgamation, Absoluteness, and Categoricity" addresses some issues around this. Here is a link $URL$ 

The proper framework for your question is the so-called strict topology on the space of bounded continuous functions which was introduced for the case of a locally compact space by R.C. Buck in the 50's and extended to the case of a completely regular space by several authors around 1970. It has the property that the dual is the space of tight Radon measures. In your case (locally compact and metric, and so paracompact), there are very strong results available, particularly in the direction that you are interested in---characterisations of compactness and convergence for families of measures. A central result concerns the relationship between weak compactness and uniform tightness of such families. You might start by consulting the article "The strict topology and compactness in the space of measures" by John B. Conway which appeared in the Transactions 126 (1967) 474-486. You could also look up the topic of Prohorov's theorem which is relevant to your query.
