An announcement like that of your management basically tells (to me) "you are free to secure your future any way you want, including getting a new job". Sending your CV to other companies and even going to interviews still does not oblige you to anything yet. However, you get valuable feedback and experience in interviewing and selling yourself on the job market. And since you still have a regular source of income, you aren't forced to accept the first job offer you get - you are free to be picky as yet, but if you get a really good offer, all the better. On the other hand, use the time you have to make up for your relative lack of experience. If you can list on your CV that even though you have no commercial development experience with technology or language X, but you have studied it out of passion in your free time, and/or did some pet projects, it certainly is a plus in the eyes of most potential employers. But even if you eventually stay at your current workplace, your studies will keep your brain in shape. Getting used to spending the day doing nothing useful will make you sluggish and demotivated in the long run. It is hard from this state of mind to get up to speed when the next project arrives. OTOH if you do spend your time practicing and learning, your manager will most likely appreciate your enthusiasm and may find a good use for the skills you acquired. 

In the European Union, you have to be careful that employees do not end up working longer hours than is allowed by the European Working Time Directive. Except in the UK (where you can agree to waive, in writing, your rights under the WTD) member states must ensure weekly working time is limited by law, or collective agreement and average working time should not exceed 48 hours for each 7 day period during the reference period of 4 months. Incidentally, in order to comply with this directive, employers in Europe are effectively forced to keep track of employee working hours. In the UK, I have known business to request that employees opt out of the WTD not so they can work longer hours, but to remove the requirement for hours to be tracked, reducing the administrative burden on both the employee and the company. 

Yes, in my experience this is common practice, but I don't think it is as deceitful as it first appears. You don't burn your bridges, either as a an employer or potential employee and sometimes, recruitment takes a while. You can genuinely want someone, but then find someone else is a better fit for business or operational reasons. Reading between the lines of what you heard from the VP and the recruiter though, I would say that all this means is that you are currently second choice on their list. They are probably waiting to hear back from someone (possibly via a different recruiter) with slightly more experience than you. You are probably their best culture fit, while someone else is their best experience fit. They want to keep you sweet because they are confident that you can do the job, even if it takes a little longer to give you the extra skills they think you need. They want to maximise the chance that you will still be available and interested if their first choice doesn't accept their offer. With respect to the recruiter, they are probably playing down your chances to stop the recruiter calling them every five minutes nagging them for an offer. They probably don't care about keeping the recruiter sweet, so depending on how aggressive the recruiter is, they might say anything to get them to stop calling. From personal experience, I have missed out on a number of jobs where people have very apologetically phoned me to say "I'm really sorry, I think you would have been great here, but we really didn't expect to find anyone who had experience with X, Y and Z.". People can be genuinely complementary and want you, but circumstances beyond their control might push them towards another candidate. Essentially, someone who can hit the ground running will usually be preferred over someone who will take a while to get started, even if they may end up being a better team player in the long run. So, don't give up hope, keep looking, and try to assume the best of people rather than the worst. 

At this point you should make it clear that focusing on the issue in project X was the explicit request of your line manager, not your own idea. Like "Well, my line manager requested we deal with an urgent issue in project X before completing project XX. X has some internal problems that can be solved only by end of week." From this point on, they can (hopefully) fight it out between themselves. In case your line manager backs up saying he didn't explicitly request anything like that, it may have been a misunderstanding etc., you should request a private talk with him asap to address the issue, however unpleasant that feels to you. You should make it clear to him that your successful cooperation depends on mutual trust between the two of you, but double-talk ruins trust. One of the possible outcomes may be that in the future you only take such requests from him in explicit written form. Or that before complying to such requests, you always go and double check with the mini-CEO. And this leads to the underlying problem, which seems to be an unclear allocation of responsibilities. Why is it that both the mini-CEO and your line manager can make decisions about the allocation of resources to projects, and prioritization of tasks? You should strive to make responsibilities clear in this respect. There should ultimately be one single person to make the call. Find out who that is, and listen to him/her from then on. 

In many places, a reference doesn't necessarily have to be from your last job, it could be from a previous job. If you are still employed, you can even use the justification that you don't want to warn your current employer that you are looking for another job. If not, you can still claim that a previous employer could provide a more objective assessment, especially if you are in the middle of claim for unfair dismissal. Finally, in litigious locations, employers are often reticent to provide references which include anything other than verifiable fact. In many cases they will refuse to confirm anything other than the dates you worked there, since even saying how many sick days you took could be considered disclosure of private information and open them up to the risk of a libel case. 

No, it is not acceptable to use pirated software to do your job, in fact it could lose you your job. In the UK, the use of pirated software would usually be considered gross misconduct and be grounds for summary dismissal, so as risks go, that's a pretty big one. As others have mentioned, the reason companies treat this so seriously is because the consequences for the company can be grave. In the UK, The Federation Against Software Theft (FAST) publicises the legal penalties and security risks for piracy and prosecutes both organisations and individuals on behalf of its members. They also promote the use of Software Asset Management to help companies avoid copyright infringement. Even using software provided by your company, if you know it to be pirated, could result in pretty dire consequences - it's not impossible that you could be considered to be a conspirator and personally liable. Under such circumstances, ethically you should report the infringement to FAST (in the UK) and any repercussions for this should be covered by whistleblower legislation. The situation in the US, or in any of the countries around the world whose legal system is based on the UK/UK models, would be pretty much the same. The specific laws, crimes and enforcement agencies would be different, but the essential principal and the ethics of the situation would be identical. 

I think you may be looking at it from the wrong end. It's not the profession / career which allows you to live in different countries, it's you who is making a conscious choice about this (and maybe rearranging your life and habits to support it). If you want to learn languages, just pick your favourite and start learning it today :-) Once you can talk a bit, you can leave for a trip abroad. Or even before. I got a scholarship to Spain during my uni years so I was lucky enough to spend 6 months there. I knew about two words in Spanish when I arrived, with a language coursebook in my pack, and spent many of my evenings studying. By the time I left Spain, I could speak fairly fluently. It was one of the best times of my life! As the example shows, there are lots of other possibilities apart from getting a proper job abroad, if you want to discover the world: 

Those that can't take you seriously will not join your company in the first place. But once someone joined, they will most likely be positive about you, to avoid cognitive dissonance if nothing else. Unless you yourself disappoint them, of course. If you introduce yourself to them like you do here, you set extremely high expectations, thus you have to be really really good to live up to your own promise. 

The important thing to get across to people is that as an intern you are already costing them a lot of money, so the extra cost of a little training could be small compared to value they gain in the short term from you having had that training. Using your example, if providing you with Methyl Salicylate handling training would mean that you could take the load off a permanent employee who is currently over-stretched, or allow someone else to provide even more business value than they are currently providing, you might be able to convince them to authorise the training. As with many things in business, you have to provide a business case for anything you want to spend company money on. You may not have all of the figures needed for a full cost-benefit analysis, but just having the discussion with your manager/mentor could be all that is needed to find other areas where a business case could be argued. 

A very powerful, but often overlooked way of discouraging excessive overtime is to offer people flexible working hours. If you have a system in place for flexi-time, then people are both careful to accurately record their working hours, so that they don't lose out on accumulating flexi hours, and mindful of the hours they are working. An example flexi-time system might have core hours of 10:00 to 16:00, allow an employee to accumulate up to 3 days (24 hours) of flexi-time, or go into one days flexi-time debt, but require that they take no more than 2 days (or 4 half days) of flexi-leave (time off within core hours) per month without taking annual leave. It may seem counter-intuitive, but psychologically, if you are getting close to the upper limit on the hours you can accumulate, you start thinking "if I work too many more hours, I'll lose them at the end of the month", so you start to cut down. 

I think you need to understand the different cultural background of people from Eastern countries (in the broad sense). In these cultures openly admitting a fault is seen as a weakness and personal loss, hence people try to avoid this at all costs and fight back at any perceived attempt to criticize them or their actions or decisions. Which of course does make it very challenging for people from other cultures to work with them and solve problems together, but this is just a given which IMO you need to understand. So if you want to continue working with them and succeed with the project, I think you'd better avoid any direct criticism, and try to frame it instead as an improvement idea, or try to give them subtle hints only and allow them to "invent" the great idea by themselves. In this way their ego will not be threatened and they can be made to accept new ideas. The obvious backside is that they will most likely take the credit for any success and any novel idea. If you can live with that, go ahead; if not, try to get out of this as soon as possible. 

And from your part, it would be better to give them examples and stories showing how your self-study improved your skills and experience in the past, and why you are eager to continue that. This may give a much more realistic picture of your skills and motivation to your prospective employer than telling you spend on average 1 minute or 3 hours per day studying. As well as this way you avoid the dilemma over getting committed into something you may not want to.
