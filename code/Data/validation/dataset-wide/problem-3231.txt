While the UK 'lost' the 13 colonies, it still 'possessed' Canada. Therefore it still had trade opportunities and defense commitments in North America, and similar arrangements in Australia and New Zealand. The character of these in particular is that they were sparsely populated by aboriginals, they were at a significant distance from the 'mother country', and they were colonized largely by 'their own people'. India doesn't fit this description - India already had both advanced social orders and had been 'civilized' for thousands of years. While the colonies were 'revolting', the British had other things on their mind, in particular the Industrial Revolution. Many of their more immediate concerns was the construction of steamships and railroads, dealing with the social costs of rapid industrialization, and restructuring the political order to deal with the emerging merchant and professional classes. In this respect Britain was trying to 'straddle the fence': they had both an external and internal focus. The colonial adventures were an attempt to secure raw materials, which often didn't work out as planned. Britain granted Canada 'independence' in 1867 - without much more than a ceremony and signing some agreements. In short, it didn't take even another 100 years to realize that attempts at ruling North American territories wasn't worth it. Much of this would have been due to the massive investments needed to, for example, built railroads across 3000 mile expanses of wetlands, plains, and mountains. While resources were there, manpower wasn't. Populating North American involved massive waves of immigration from nearly every other country on Earth, a process that continues to this day. 

One other book that offers a lot of insight is named 'Balance - from Ancient Rome to Modern America'. When I see books that expound at length on the fate of the US, the first thing I use to figure out whether it's a hack job is to look at how quickly the content turns into invective. I've found books that start on page one by blaming some group of evil people in the midst of a conspiracy, and it doesn't stop - ever. This is not one of those books. One point made in this book is that Rome never 'fell', it simply dissolved. It wasn't replaced by some other empire, as it fell apart it simply deteriorated into isolated chunks. However, there is a purported natural disaster that occurred around 535 AD, this is presumably a 'dark age' as the result of a volcanic eruption, probably in Sumatra. The few years after this event were known for starvation, cannibalism, mass migration, and other evidence of serious ecological disturbance. One point the book makes is that governments tend to get in debt, which simply gets worse over time. True for Rome, France at the time of the Revolution, most 'Western' countries today, and others. Generally the trends (as the book points out) are that government benefits become more generous, groups split up into more and more assertive special interest groups intent on protecting their privileges, and the sovereign state turns 'inward' - building walls instead of roads, excluding foreigners and expelling 'undesirables' instead of absorbing fresh blood from afar. As the US debt approaches the capacity of taxpayers to keep up, the credibility of the central government declines. In short, if you know someone that has cash, you believe them when they say they're going to do something. If you know someone is broke but can borrow money, you suspect they aren't going to attempt anything as ambitious as someone with money. If you know someone that is not only broke but in such hock that no one will loan them any more, you know they're basically trapped, and not going anywhere. This is the likely fate of most modern democracies. At some point people will simply quit believing government has the capacity to act. One would expect this to lead to moral decline, but other institutions tend to spring up to take it's place, and often these are religious. 

Debt between sovereign states (or separate currency unions) is a peculiar creature. We can take for example a late 1970s year in which Japan was pouring econo-cars into the US market, US car companies were in deep trouble, and it seemed like every VCR, TV, and eggbeater had a Japanese name on it. Due to the habit of Japanese not to buy foreign goods if they could avoid it, we had a trade imbalance, and this was 'funded' by 'borrowing money' from Japan. What this meant in particular is that the Japanese central bank would purchase US Treasury Bills, flooding the US and eventually global economy with Yen. If we look carefully at what that means, it means that the US printed paper IOUs furiously while the Japanese poured their efforts into making 'real things': cars, TVs, etc., and shipping these to us to consume. Japan currently holds about $1 trillion in US debt (China, at this moment, has about $1.3 trillion). If Japan sells this debt to Saudi Arabia, it would be most likely in exchange for oil - something 'real'. If Japan were to demand 'repayment', the only way that could be done is for Japan to purchase real goods from the US - aircraft, wheat, beef, oranges, CPU chips, lumber, or whatever. At that point, dollar denominated debt would be repatriated in exchange for dollar denominated products. Needless to say, anything bought from America is not produced in Japan. Presumably anything the Japanese could produce would never be bought from the US. Therefore, Japan would be creating jobs in the US if they demanded 'repayment'. Probability this will happen: zero. In short, if the US sells debt to foreign countries that 'protect' their domestic industries from foreign competition, they will tend to accumulate foreign debt which they will never redeem, unless they get in the kind of trouble where they need massive imports. Another peculiarity of all this is that the Japanese have been big savers. Therefore, the combined debt of the Japanese government and the American government are 'assets' to Japanese households. These 'assets' tend to be kept under the mattress, figuratively speaking. In short, money is earned, much of it is stashed away and never spent. One interpretation of what money is is that it stimulates production and consumption. Therefore, as the US spends money like water the restaurants are full of waiters pocketing tips that are using it to buy gasoline which the station uses to buy gas which the oil company uses to run refineries, etc., etc. If the wage earner chooses in instead to park it in a safe, it doesn't stimulate commerce. If it sits in the safe until the 20-something retires at age 55, that currency does not act as money over a period of, say 30 years. That is 30 years of potential vendors not working and not earning those yen or dollars. Therefore, as the US 'prints' money and puts it in circulation, foreign debtors remove it by 'saving' it in their respective central banks. This is also a problem within the US: wealthy people also 'hoard' cash, so to speak, rather than keeping it circulating in the economy to stimulate further activity.
