The terms - Intuition, Pure Intuition and Logical Form - at least in philosophy are associated with Kantian metaphysics; this reading is confirmed by: From the SEP article on Poincare: 

Hume argued that the 'understanding' or reason could not account for causality. He looked towards experience of the external world. Kant talks about his Copernican revolution: He says people were asking how do we get to know about things out there, he turns it around and assumes that objects out there conform to our intuitions (of time, space & causality), which are then presented to our reason. That is he locates time, space & causality within our mind but outside of reason. They are the conditions for experience: Had we not that, we wouldn't be able to experience anything. Chomsky does something similar when he posits the mind has a universal grammar, and it conforms itself to the particular language environment it finds itself in. A Kantean position, one level further up. 

He understands that the educational apparatus of the state by reducing the vigour and self-sufficiency of children, renders them as a burden on their parents; and this dual disadvantage is what calls 'murder'. Murder of spiritual & bodily vigour. So Rousseau, discoursing on the 'State of Nature', the first philosopher of this being perhaps, Hobbes, says that no philosopher has actually reached there. This is because they have mistaken both the essence of the State and the essence of Nature, and as in Platos Republic, set the State above Nature; or in some contemporary interpretations Nature above the State. What he asserts is for Nature to be immanent in the State - and thus the metaphor of Sparta. One might note, that the anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss in a footnote in his book Tristes Tropiques, pejoratively remarks on the super-literacy of Islam; which on reflection is at least as true of the Christian West. This whole story in some sense is a development of an argument in Platos Phaedrus, the myth of Theuth, which is generally taken to say that 'writing' as an educational innovation is prejudicial to learning which is in essence 'oral'. When one thinks of 'writing' as the technology of bureaucracy, that is the apparatus of the state, this is seen to be placed below the technology of the self, the one closer to mans own body, and of his own essence - 'speech'. Derrida, following Rousseau above shows how to dissolve this binary opposition & hierarchy in his essay Platos Pharmacy. 

Given that the other answers have given very good advice on the means towards philosophy, I'll concentrate, here, on the ends. Given the heavy representation of foundations in the philosophy of mathematics, it might be worth looking more broadly to at least find where you are situated in this philosophical landscape. For example, this article on the philosophy of Lautmon begins by saying: 

But he doesn't demolish metaphysics completely - he is providing a critique and a coherent grounding: 

Famous philosophers such as Kant or Heidegger were also academic philosophers. In my (limited) experience its standard practise that academics provide a bibliography/references to ground their text. However, it seems that the famous philosophers don't do this, unless the texts which I've seen, mostly online, have had this exercised. Is this actually the case? Does a secondary literature provide the sources that the Famous Philosophers neglect to provide themselves? Or is the standard practise of bibliographies a relatively recent innovation? 

The short answer is that the predicate you are using to extend PA is actually a new axiom appended to PA. So it is automatically true by definition. However before you add this predicate one should check its truth value in PA. If it is true, there is no point adding it. If it is false, then by adding it you are rendering the new system inconsistent. Hence you must choose a predicate that is cannot be proven to be true or false - that is it is independent of the axioms of PA. Now when you add this predicate, it becomes true by virtue of it being an axiom. Now, with your new axiom appended the language of PA becomes larger (there are more sentences) and Godels incompleteness still applies to this system (because it obviously contains PA) so there is a new sentence in the language of PA which is true (that is true in every model of PA) but which the deduction system attached to the theory of PA will not prove (here proof is purely formal - there is no neccessary connection with truth; truth is established in a model). Thus it is still incomplete. It will still remain sound: That is a sentence that can be proved - is actually true (that is true in every model). 

I'm just going to tackle your headline question on the distinction between abstract & concrete. The notion to tackle here, in computer science terms is in whats called type theory; its not neccessary though to go into great detail; and its useful to pursue an analogy with set theory here. A type names a set; the desiderata that specifies what this type entails is like the defining conditions of the set; the actual objects that satisfy these desiderata exemplify the type, in set-theory speak these are the elements of the set. For example: 

Information is a new paradigm to represent the world, as the clockwork universe was in Newtonian Physics. Bits are great for digital computers but they're nowhere near sophisticated enough for the structures found useful in Modern Physics. One should note, that chaotic dynamics in Newtonian physics and possible topology change at plank distances when the effect of Heisenbergs uncertainty principle coupled with GR show that information density at those scales are probably uncomputable. There is however a type-theoretic interpretation of quantum field theory that is an active field of research. Type-theory was originally instigated by Russell & Whitehead which uses classical logic, in its modern incarnation its Martin-Lofs Type Theory which uses intuitionistic logic and is the internal language of a (infinity,1)-Topos. Its also known in another interpretation as Homotopy Type Theory. Interestingly enough this connects to foundational issues in mathematics. Mainstream foundations use Sets as their fundamental structure - and are not geometric, here it is homotopy types that are regarded as fundamental and they are geometric. Notably, the theorem-provers Coq & Agda are both based on variants of Martin-Lofs Type Theory. Essentially this is merging logic, computer science, mathematical foundations and physics.
