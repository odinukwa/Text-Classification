neither. The heat death of the universe is a conceptual misundertanding about how the laws of thermodynamics apply to the universe as a whole. If you think the universe is a closed system, then heat death seems inevitable. However, there's absolutely no reason to assume the universe is a closed system. Certainly the observable universe has a boundary. This is the event horizon beyound the rest of the cosmos is unobservable. There is nothing to prevent matter and energy crossing the event horizon, so this doesn't constitute a closed system. Therefore, magic will neither accelerate or slow down the heat death of the universe, because there is no heat death of the universe. Unless, of course, there is a magic spell to make the heat death of the universe actually happen, then all bets are off. (That would require an enormously powerful magic spell, beyond anything any single magic caster or whole legions of them could possibly cast or even spell.) This does make sense, so forget it. Also, it turn the fantasy into some kind of science fiction, therefore, it's totally impossible! Anyone experiencing sleepless nights worrying about the heat death of the universe you can rest easy tonight. 

The Alien DoomFleet only has to tow a gigantic parasol or space sunshade into place above a planet blocking its insolation from its primary star. Once no ambient stellar radiation is warming the planet its temperature will fall until the atmosphere freezes out and the planet's surface is covered in a frozen layer of its atmospheric gases. The DoomFleet sends in armies of robots and evacuation equipment to scrape the frozen atmosphere off the planet's surface and transport to wherever they want to transport it. Perhaps to planets the DoomFleet's creators want to terraform. Freezing planets in this way is also an excellent way of exterminating the inhabitants of planets. Freeze, scrape and shift and a planet's atmosphere is gone. Not as spectacular as some methods, but guaranteed effective. 

Any set of forces capable of regenerating tissue damage and broken bones in seconds should be equally capable of resetting broken bones before the regenerative healing kicks. Since we're talking super-powers there might be a delay mechanism that halts bone regeneration until they are in the proper position. That way there is no likelihood of deformed. If regeneration results in deformed bones, there is an unpleasant and easy answer. Place the bones in the correct position, break them again without changing their alignment and let regeneration take its course. Ouch! The energetics of regeneration are a worry. It take a lot of energy out of the person to repair wounds and broken bones. Plus the area around the wound and broken bones could become very hot. If the person has super-powers, then they should be capable of surviving and/or enduring elevated temperatures. Otherwise they will need to regeneration themselves where parts of their bodies have been cooked. When someone with broken bones was undergoing regeneration this would be accompanied by the sound of grinding as their bones moved back into position and knitted themselves back together. Also, it should hurt like Hell. 

If the Solara Prime system has five worlds that are inhabited. This will create an interesting challenge for the beings on any one world arising from the presence of beings on the other four worlds. Although you suggest that the inhabitants of all five worlds are human, this does seem biologically and evolutionary improbable. George Gaylord Simpson has argued this in The Nonprevalence of Humanoids, Science 21 Feb 1964: Vol. 143, Issue 3608, pp. 769-775. This can be found here. A system with five different species of sapients would be a major cultural driver. This would cover everything from religion, philosophy, exploration, military conflict, science, and politics. The possibility of interacting with multiple sapients and their worlds would be a massive impetus driving the development of all five worlds. This would influence almost every aspect of their lives and cultures to a degree that can be barely imagined by the inhabitants of a planet with a single dead moon. Technologically speaking, this system of five worlds are all within easy reach of each other using chemical rocket propulsion. Earth's humans long dreamed on travel to their Moon. Solara Prime's sapients will be able to dream to four other worlds on any one of the five worlds. When solar electric ion propulsion systems are developed spaceships will be able to travel more easily and efficiently through and around this five world system. 

Source: $URL$ There are two main factors that mitigate against any organism developed gravitational-wave perception. Firstly, they would need to be surrounded by a continuous illumination of colliding black holes. Secondly, if they had LIGO-like receptors the things are too incredibly complicated, difficult to construct, and they're plain too big. This does overlook trying to perceive changes in size of the order of the thickness of a human hair over a length equivalent to a light year. A tad bit tricky? More like lots tricky. Perhaps an organism that is the size of a small planet living in a cosmic environment extremely rich in colliding black holes might, remotely conceivable, need to "see" gravitational waves, but it might be able to develop other sensory systems that could do the same job with less trouble and difficulty. Pity really. Gravitational-wave perceiving critters would be so cool!! 

While the experimental protocol involved in this research wouldn't pass most ethics committees, however if we assume aliens are ethically challenged in the way they conduct research, then this is plausible. It's all a matter of considering what sort of research is being conducted in these experiments. Basically we know humans are being kidnapped and transported to a terraformed planet. This process has been going since prehistoric times. So humans will have developed, initially, a palaeolithic culture. Presumably as things go on, their technology and culture will develop and various forms of civilization will arise. However, over time the civilization(s) on the terraformed planet will be supplemented by the continual arrival of more humans who will bring with them the latest developments of technology and culture from planet Earth. Possibly the humans on the experimental planet will have learned to expect this continued influx of new arrivals and adapted their cultures accordingly. Now we come to the crux of the matter. What is the nature of the experiment being run by the aliens? This by now should be obvious. It is an experiment in continuous adaptation and development of members of a sapient species, in this case humans, who have been transplanted in the environment(s) of a different world, in this case a terraformed planet. While it is not unreasonable to condemn this experiment on ethical grounds. It is, after all, being conducted without the consent of the experimental subjects and their descendants are forced to remain as inhabitants of the terraformed planet without any redress. This type of research does appear to be quite plausible and could be carried by almost highly advanced technological civilization where its scientific practices are more than somewhat ethically challenged. In conclusion, understand the science and you can understand the reasons for doing it. This makes it plausible. Not nice, but plausible. 

Assuming super-Venus has gone through a similar geological history as real-world Venus, then the main differences will be in its atmosphere and its consequent impact on the planet's surface. The atmosphere of Super-Venus will be significantly hotter and exert more pressure on the planet. This is due to a greatly enhanced greenhouse effect raising the temperature of the atmosphere. The impact of the hotter atmosphere and surface will cause geological features undergo greater amounts of plastic flow than happens to geological features on the surfaces of Earth and Venus. This should make its surface generally flatter. On the other hand, there will be significantly more volcanic activity. It is to be expected that super-Venus, like its real-world equivalent, will have lost its plate tectonics and there will be no continental drift because of its thicker crust and lithosphere. This means the planet will behave a volcanic pressure cooker kept under heat and pressure until it explodes. There will be a massive outflow of lava sufficient to repave the surface of the entire planet. This is the mechanism responsible for keeping the surface of Venus so young. It is probable that super-Venus may blow its stack more frequency. This again suggests its surface will be generally flat. Of course, mountain-like features that do arise are most probably volcanoes in the making. best to keep your seismometers handy to warn of any impending eruptions. In conclusion super-Venus may have a geography and topography very similar to that of real-world Venus only more so. 

This is more of a metamorphosis than shape-changing in the sense of an organism taking on the shape, appearance and form of another creature. To make this transformation scientifically plausible assume the man and the monster are different forms of the same organism. For the organism to transform this could be triggered by conscious volition where the organism can decide to change and does, hormonally either by taking hormones in pill form or as part of its 'natural' lifecycle. This approach will restrict the transformation from man into monster by only allowing the monster to be a humanoid creature no bigger than a gigantopithecus. So the transformation will change, say, a six foot man into a nine foot giant ape sized creature. This is not exactly the largish monster the OP requested, but it has been scaled to meet the requirements of hard-science plausibility. Most the transformation will take place in existing structures possessed by the organism in its normal human morph. Skin, for example, could change colour and form a scaly epidermis, while wattles like those of a turkey might form around its face and head. Additional hair could sprout. Teeth could be replaced by longer and larger teeth rather like baby teeth are replaced and nails grow into claws. Muscles could grow larger and more powerful. This would be effectively a hormone driven muscle building genetically innate program. The organism would need to consume huge amounts of food and nutrients to bulk itself up into gigantopithecus sized monster. Access to highly functional toilet system would be essential as the organism will need to expel quite large amounts of waste material as it undergoes its metamorphosis. Cleaniness and hygiene should not be neglected. The process of metamorphosis will take weeks as the OP correctly suggested. A man to monster metamorphosis of this kind would have to be custom built. Presumably, by biotechnologists using highly advanced genetic engineering based on a level of biological knowledge well ahead of 21st century life sciences. 

What are the most likely conditions for an organism, no matter how hypothetical, to be called a time fly? Firstly, it must look like a fly. Say, a common fly. Since flies tend to buzz around in an annoying manner, we can assume a time fly will do the same but utilizing a simple form of time travel. This establishes our second criterion. This is basically a time-shifting dipteran. This basic form of time travel can operate with the fly shifting into either the future or the past. Presumably with some compensation for spatial displacement due to the motion of a planet like Earth's orbit around the Sun, and around the galactic centre. Such a time fly will be even more adept at avoiding being swatted since it can shift to a point in time when the fly swatter isn't about to hit it. Accordingly a time fly will resemble a normal fly and it will be even more annoying than ordinary flies because its ability to switch forwards and backwards in time. 

While our round Earth looks, it's possible that a flat earth will appear curved to its inhabitants. This effect would be due to the refraction of light as it passes through the atmosphere. The simplest version of this atmospheric refraction model of a flat earth would be that this earth would curve upwards the further away from where a person was standing. It could be like standing in the centre of a bowl. Instead of a horizon everything in the distance would be effectively rising higher further it was from where you were situated. Please this effect depends on the science of optics as it was developed before the Michelson-Morley experiment. This answer hasn't considered the influence of a luminiferous ether on the refraction effects, but the OP devised how the ether affects light in his world it will be easy to adjust his model accordingly and determine how a refraction bowl view of the flat earth might look. Thermal differences in the atmosphere could create different degrees of refraction. Instead of uniformly curving upwards this could lead to a complicated affair curving both up and down in different places. This might be continually be rippling and undulating. A flat earth might seem to be unstable and changing in unpredictable ways. Imagine the landscape curving away either up or down and possibly rippling as if it was the edge of the sea. EDIT: Please note the original answer had "diffraction" instead of "refraction" as the cause of the optic effects described above. This error has been fixed.
