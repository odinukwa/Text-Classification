Maybe the following article by Soenke Rollenske (and refferences their), could be usefull for you: Some very non-Kähler manifolds: the Frölicher spectral sequence can be arbitrarily non degenerate $URL$ 

There are counter-examples, hope they answer your question completely, just take any non-simply connected $G$ and consider its action on $T^*G$. The simplest case is: Let $M$ be the cylinder $S^1\times \mathbb R$ with the symplectic form $ds \wedge dt$. Then the Hamiltonial $H=t$ defines an $S^1$-action on the cylinder. One more counterexamle. Consider just the action of $SO(3)$ on its cotangent space. Clearly this action is Hamiltonian. Let us take the subgroup $S^1\subset SO(3)$ that represents the non-zero element of $\pi_1(SO(3))$. Obviously all the orbits of the action of this $S^1$ on $T^*(SO(3))$ will not be contractible. So we see that in the case the Lie group is not simply-connected it always admits a "bad" action. 

For terminal singularities this will not work already if we apply pushforward to the canonical bundle. Indeed, not all terminal singularities is Gorenstein. A simple contre-example is $\mathbb C^3/ \pm 1$. 

Here is one example. Let $M^3$ be a hyperbolic manifold. Consider the moduli space curvature $-1$ metrics on $M^3$ modulo $Diff_0(M^3)$. This is a point. Conclusion: every diffeomorphism of $M^3\to M^3$ is homotopic to an isometry. 

Here is an explicit example. Denote by $E$ the elliptic curve $E=\mathbb C/(\mathbb Z+i\mathbb Z)$. Now let $B=C=E$. The involution that we will consider is $$(z,w)\in (E\times E)\to (z+\frac{1}{2},-w).$$ Notice now that this quotient is not a direct product anymore. You can see this by calculating $H_1(E\times E)/\mathbb Z_2$ and verifying that it is not $\mathbb Z^4$. Alternatively, you can notice that the quotient does not have a non-vanishing holomorphic volume form. Indeed if such form existed it could be lifted to $E\times E$ to a form $cdz\wedge dw$ ($c\ne 0$), which would give a contradiction since $dz\wedge dw$ is anti-invariant. 

Dear Common Crane, let me list several results and question going in the direction of your intuition (all the information below I learned from Sergey Galkin) 1) Theorem. Hirzebruch-Kodaira, Yau. A Kahler manifold homeomorphic to $\mathbb CP^n$ is biholomorphic to $\mathbb CP^n$. There is a nice exposition of this result by Valentino Tossati: $URL$ 2) There is a question of Wilson: If $V$ is a complex projective manifold of even dimension $n>k(V)$ and which has the same rational cohomology as $P^n$, is $V$ isomorphic to $P^n$? 3) In dimension 3 there are "four" complex projective manifolds with same Betti numbers as $\mathbb CP^3$ (these manifolds are $P^3$, the quadric, the manifold called $V_5$ and finally $V_{22}$. The first three manifolds are rigid, but the last one has six-dimensional moduli space of deformations). 4) Finally you can find some interesting recent development related to the question in the preprint $URL$ where you will as well find references for articles in 1), 2). 

The answer to this question is negative in dimensions $\ge 3$. For example, take a quintic in $\mathbb CP^4$ and consider its blow up $X$ in $10^{100}$ points (just to be safe). Then the space $H^1(X, T_X)$ will be huge, since it parametrises deformations of the blown up variety and you can move points as you wish. So there will be non-zero $u\in H^1(X, T_X)$ so that you map is trivial. Note that when you blow up the quintic $H^{2,1}$ does not change. Also, this trick with blow ups will not work for Kahler surfaces as is explained for example, in appendix 1 in $URL$ 

Let me give a version of the question in the comment: Let $X$ be a curve of genus $g$ with a real separting involution, and conisder the map $Sym^n(X_+)\to Jac^n(X)$. For wich $n$ is this map surjective? Or, in other words, what is the minimal number of poles of a meromorphic function with poles in $X_+$ that garanties that zeros can happen at any collection of points? This sounlds like a very nice question. In the case $g=1$ you can always take $n=2$. Also for any $g$ you sould take $n>g$ because $Sym^g(X)$ maps to $Jac^g(X)$ with degree $1$. Added. The notation $Sym^n(X)$ means the symmetric power of $X$. Let me explain also why what is above is a reformulation of the original question. Indeed, a divisor $\sum_i x_i-\sum_i y_i$ on $X$ is a divisor of a meromorfic function iff it represent zero in $Jac^0(X)$. So if we want to chose arbitraly zeros $x_i$ of a meromorphic function $f$ keeping the poles $y_i$ in $X_+$ it is enouth to know that $\sum_i y_i$ can take any value in $Jac^n(X)$ (to cancel the point $\sum_i x_i$). This is eactly the condition that $Sym^n(X_+)\to Jac^n(X)$ is surjective. 

Hurewicz theorem says that for a simply connected space $X$, $\pi_2(X)\cong H_2(X,\mathbb Z)$. So $\pi_2(K3)\cong H_2(K3,\mathbb Z)\cong \mathbb Z^{22}$. Here is a link: $URL$ 

What you want almost works, but with a little twist. The group $SO(3)$ is acting on $F_2$, so that there are two orbits that are $\mathbb CP^1$ and all other orbits are $SO(3)$. More precisely, $F_2$ can be seen as a compactification of $\mathbb R_+\times SO(3)$. Indeed, $F_2$ can be seen as a compactificaton of $(\mathbb C^2\setminus 0)/\pm Id$, and $\mathbb C^2\setminus 0\cong \mathbb R_+\times SU(2)$. Here $\mathbb R_+$ means positive reals. Details. Each Hirzebruch surface $F_n$ can be obtained by a quotient construction from $F_1$. Recall, that $F_1$ is the surface that is obtained by a blow up of a single point on $\mathbb CP^2$. I.e., we "replace" a point on $\mathbb CP^2$ by $\mathbb CP^1$. Of course we all know that $SU(2)$ is acting on $\mathbb CP^2$ fixing a point and a line at infinity (just take the usual action of $SU(2)$ on $\mathbb C^2$ fixing $0$ and extend it to the action on $\mathbb CP^2$). When we blow up $0$ on $\mathbb CP^2$ the action of $SU(2)$ extends on $F_1$. Now, $F_n$ can be obtained from $F_1$ by the quotient, $F_n\cong F_1/\mathbb Z_n$, where $\mathbb Z_n$ is the group of scalar matrices generated by $e^{2\pi i/n}\times Id$ acting in the standard way on $\mathbb C^2$ (and hence on $F_1$). Finally, notice that in the case of $F_2$ the corresponding group $\mathbb Z_2$ belongs to $SU(2)$ (since $det(-Id)=1$). And since $SO(3)\cong SU(2)/\mathbb Z_2$ this explains, hopefully, the construction. Of course all this is completely classical, but I can not give a reference from the top of my head. 

This is the question. Is it known that a symplectic $4$-fold with $b_2>1$ should have a homology class $C$ with $C^2<0$? 

One can even define a holomorphic (i.e. integrable almost complex) structure on this Grassmanian. To give the definition it is easier to consider instead $Gr_2^{-}(E^{n+2}_{2})$ which is obviously the same object. Definition. We will identify the Grassmanian of two-planes with a part of the quadric in $\mathbb CP^{n+1}$. Namely, let $\mathbb C^{n+2}$ be the complexification of $\mathbb R^{n+2}$: $\mathbb C^{n+2}=\mathbb R^{n+2}\oplus i \mathbb R^{n+2}$. Let $x_1,...,x_{n+2}$ be the coordinates in $\mathbb R^{n+2}$, so that the quadratic form corresponding to the metric is $x_1^2+...+x_{n}^2-x_{n+1}^2-x_{n+2}^2$. Let $z_1,...,z_n$ be the complexified coordinates, and let $Q(z)=z_1^2+...+z_{n}^2-z_{n+1}^2-z_{n+2}^2$ be the complexified quadratic form. Now, consider the quadric cone $Q(z)=0$, in $\mathbb C^{n+2}$ ($z=x+iy$, $x,y\in \mathbb R^{n+2}$). Notice that $Gr_2^{-}(E^{n+2}_{2})$ is naturally is an open subset of the projectivisation of the cone $Q(z)=0$. Indeed, for any pair of orthogonal unite vectors $x\perp y$ in $\mathbb R^2\subset \mathbb R^{n+2}$ we can associate a complex vector $z=x+iy$, $z\in \mathbb C^{n+2}$, satisfying $Q(z)=0$. The line $\lambda z\subset \mathbb C^{n+2}$ is independent on the choice of orthogonal unite vectors $x,y$ in $\mathbb R^2$. It is easy to see that the complex structure constructed this way is invariant with respect to the action of isometries of $\mathbb R^{n+2}$ on $Gr_2^{-}(E^{n+2}_{2})$. PS holomorphic structure in local coordinates. In order to present a bit more explicitly the above complex structure on the Grassmanian we can proceed in two ways. First is just to take some meromorphic functions on the quadric and see what kind of function we get on the Grassmanian. Simplest meromorphic function would be $\frac{z_k}{z_l}=\frac{x_k+iy_k}{x_l+iy_l}$. Now if you take an isotropic two-plane spanned by two unit ortogonal vectors $x$ and $y$, the value of the above function on the plane is precisely $\frac{x_k+iy_k}{x_l+iy_l}$ (where $x_k, x_l$ are the corresponding coordinates of the vector $x$, and $y_k, y_l$ are $k$th and $l$th coordinates of $y$). So, this tells you how to construct lots of meromorphic functions. Second way would be to define explicitly the operator $J$ on the tangent space to a point of the Grassmanian. Recall that the tangent space to a Grassmanian of $k$-planes $V\subset \mathbb R^{n+2}$ at point $V$ is $Hom(V,\mathbb R^{n+2}/V)$. In our case $dim V=2$ and $V^{\perp}\cap V=0$, so the tangent space is can be seen as $T_V=Hom(V,V^{\perp})$. We want to find a natural $J$ on $T_V$. The best thing to do is to find $J$ that is invariant under the action of the stabiliser of (oriented) $V$ in the orthogonal group. This stabiliser is $SO(2)\times SO(n)$. Denote by $I$ the operator $V\to V$ that rotates $V$ by $90^0$. Now we can define $J$ as follows: for any $A\in Hom(V,V^{\perp})$, $J(A)=AI$. Obviously $J^2=-Id$, and $J$ commutes with $SO(2)\times SO(n)$. Finally note that $J$ and $-J$ are the only two operators that satisfy these properties. PPS. The metric The space $Gr_2^{-}(E^{n+2}_{2})$ is a symmetric space, it has a metric such that for each point $p$ there is an isometry fixing $p$ and inducing the map $-Id$ on $T_p$. To define the metric we just use the fact that $V$ and $V^{\perp}$ are Euclidean spaces and there is a unique up to constant quadratic form on $Hom(V,V^{\perp})$ invariant under $SO(2)\times SO(n)$. This defines you a metric on $T_V$. The involution fixing $V$ and preserving the metric is given by $V\oplus V^{\perp}\to -V\oplus V^{\perp}$ i.e. it is $-Id$ on $V$ and $Id$ on $V^{\perp}$. One place to read a bit about symmetric spaces (and plenty of other interesting things) is section 2.1 in the Donaldson's Lectures on Lie groups and geometry: $URL$ 

This inequality is not true. Consider the rectangle on $\mathbb R^2$ with vertices $(\pm 1, 0)$, $(0, \pm \varepsilon)$. Then on the left you have $2\varepsilon(4-8/\pi)$ on the right you have approximatively $4\varepsilon^2$. 

Just to give one more refference, there is now a new proof of this theorem that does not use the deep result of Taubes, the proof is elementary and 8 pages long: $URL$ 

I will just consider the simplest example, maybe someone will give the answer in complete generality. So let $M=\mathbb CP^n$. Then $4n-2c_1(M)(A)=2n-2$. This means that we are in good shape. Basically we can take for $X$ and $Y$ any complex submanifolds of $M$ satisfying your condition. Indeed in this case for a generic point $p$ in $\mathbb CP^n$ there will be $deg X\cdot deg Y$ lines that contain $p$ and intersect both $X$ and $Y$. I assumed $X$ (or $Y$) is not zero dimensional, in which case there is only one line and also that $X$ and $Y$ are in general position, but this does not matter for GW, of course. 

This answer is rewritten and include more details First of all I highly recommend you the article of Paul Biran From Symplectic Packing to Algebraic Geometry and Back available on the page $URL$ , especially theorem 3.2. Your question basically asks "what is the symplectic cone of $\mathbb CP^2$ blown up in a finite number of points?" This question was answered by Paul Biran (check theorem 3.2. from the above article), though the answer is not 100% explicit. Also, it is known that the symplectic cone of $\mathbb CP^2$ blown up in up to $9$ points coincides with the Kahler cone if the points are chosen so that the resulting surface has only $-1$ curves (in particular it is Fano if the number of points is at most $8$). This permits one to answer your last question (that is done below). In fact Kahler cones of Fano surfaces rather classical objects and all basic questions about them can be answered. I would like to add that from a certain conjecture from algebraic geometry - Harbourne-Hirschowitz conjecture, it follows that the Kahler cone of $\mathbb CP^2$ blown up in a very generic collection of points coincides with its symplectic cone (Literately this conjecture says the following : any integral curve with negative self-intersection on the blow-up of $\mathbb CP^2$ at a set of points in very general position is a smooth rational curve with self-intersection $−1$. In order to deduce the statement that the symplectic cone coincides with the Kahler one you have to use SW theory). Habourine-Hirschwitz conjecture is open even for $\mathbb CP^2$ blown up in $10$ points, and the famous Nagata conjecture is a partial case of it. Now let us answer the last bit of the question. The class $2H-E_1-E_2$ is not symplectic. The symplectic cone of $\mathbb CP^2$ blown up in $2$ points coincides with the Kahler cone of $\mathbb CP^2$ blown up in two points. And $H-E_1-E_2$ is a rational $-1$-curve on this surface, while $(2H-E_1-E_2)\cdot (H-E_1-E_2)=0$, so $2H-E_1-E_2$ is not ample, and hence not symplectic. 

A little comment. A divisior D defines an embedding to the projective space of dimenison $h^0(O(D))-1$. Now for two algebraically euivalent divisors D and D' this dimension can be different. For example you can consider a curve of genus g. Then for a canoncial divisor you get an embedding to $P^{g-1}$, while for a generic divisor you get $P^{g-2}$. If you a happy to call two embeddings to spaces of diffent dimesnion algebraically equivalent, than the answer to your quesiton is yes. Overwise it is no. 

The answer to this question is no. Let me explain why, the explanation uses two facts. 1) The complement to the collection of $4$ generic lines in $\mathbb CP^2$ is not $K(\pi,1)$. Indeed, it is not hard to see that the fundamental group of this complement is $\mathbb Z^3$. At the same time the complement has homotopy type of a $CW$ complex of dimension $2$ and if it were $K(\pi, 1)$, it would zero cohomology in degree $3$, while $H^3(\mathbb Z^3)=\mathbb Z$. 2) There exist line arrangements in $\mathbb CP^2$ that contain $4$ generic lines, but at the same time their complement is $K(\pi,1)$. For example, you can take the arrangement given by $6$ lines $x=0$, $y=0$, $z=0$, $x=y$, $y=z$, $z=x$. The generic four lines in it are $x=0$, $y=0$, $x=z$, $y=z$. Proof for No. Taking the above arrangement throw away from first the line $z=0$, second the line $x=y$. Hence at the first or second time we will pass from an arrangement whose complement is $K(\pi,1)$ to the one whose complement is not $K(\pi,1)$. End. You can check that the complement to the above $6$ lines arrangement is $K(\pi,1)$ either directly, or you can use, for example the theorem of Deligne, that tells us that the complement to a complexification of a real simplicial arrangement is $K(\pi,1)$. (in our case real simplicial means that the $6$ lines are real and they cut $\mathbb RP^2$ in triangles.) Here is the reference: Deligne, Pierre Les immeubles des groupes de tresses généralisés. (French) Invent. Math. 17 (1972) 

Take a complex nilpotent or solvable group $G$ with the right action by a co-compact lattice $\Gamma$ and conisder the quotient $G/\Gamma$. On this quotient right-invariant $1$-forms give a subspace of $H^{1,0}$. The group $G$ is acting on $G/\Gamma$ on the left and if it would presrve all the $1$-forms, $G$ would be abelian. Torsten Ekedahl expained that what is following IS NOT CORRECT (the article of Hasegawa tells something different) In fact, the simplest example of this kind is given by primary Kodaira surfaces ($URL$ they have two holomorphic $1$-forms. These surfaces are described as quotinets of sovlable groups, for example, in an article of Keizo Hasegawa $URL$
