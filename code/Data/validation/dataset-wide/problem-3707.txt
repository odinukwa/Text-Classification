Have you ever trained for a triathlon? I find that triathlon training programs incorporate even levels of training in three different disciplines -- running, biking, and swimming. At various times in my life, I've had to cut back on running due to overuse injuries and during those times I tried to focus more on swimming, sometimes even doubling the workout (not something I would recommend for everyone). For good beginning triathlon training programs, this site has more than one to choose from: $URL$ The programs are free. So, if you're looking to cut back on running, both biking and swimming may be good swaps. From personal experience, I know that swimming doesn't always feel as challenging of a workout as running, but to get around that I recommend a few things: 1) A music device designed for water (my favorite is the Swim iPod: $URL$ Nothing like stroking to the beat of your favorite tune to pick up your speed and take out the monotony. 2) Swim training aids ... from paddles to fins, they can take the monotony out of swimming and make your swim more challenging. I've always had good experiences buying from Swim Outlet ($URL$ 3) I don't know if you check your heart rate when you run (to make sure you're working at your target rate), but if you're looking to improve your cardiovascular fitness while swimming, you should probably do the same. Keep in mind that your heart beats slower in the water and you should adjust your target heart rate accordingly. This article has more on the topic if it interests you: $URL$ As always never stop improving and never stop having fun, but exercise at your own risk whatever form it may take. 

In Faster Road Racing, by Pfitzinger and Latter, there is a section about cross training. They make a point whereby your MaxHR for different activities is in fact different. If I recall correctly, they also noted that the MaxHR achieved by cycling was not as high as that for running - you you can expect to "max out" at a lower HR. 

Exercise is the answer, as well as a change of diet - everybody stores fat differently, in different places. An important thought to bear in mind is that you don't get rid of fat in certain areas by targeting that region - ie, crunches will not shift that stomach fat. In terms of burning the fat, cardio is a good route to go, or weightlifting, or a mix of the two. 

As user19362 said, choice of clothing is very important when you are exercising. By wearing a jacket when the temperatures are elevated, your body will not dissipate heat as efficiently as it would if you were not wearing a jacket (sweating cools the body via evaporation, and you will be trapping the moisture under your jacket). This is not a good means for losing weight, although you may end up sweating more, you are losing water weight only, which is actually very important when you run - you need to stay hydrated! You could end up dehydrated, feeling faint, or suffer illnesses due to the heat. If you are looking to lose weight by running, given your other posts on the matter, ensure that you are eating healthily during the day (all meals), and ensure that, by running, you are producing a daily calorie deficit (burning more than you are taking in) - this means your body will start to burn other fuel sources (stored fat/sugars etc). However, this is not a message to cut back the food you eat - ensuring you have good daily nutrition is paramount. Do not be put off if you do not see results straight away - the loss of weight through exercise can be slow, but you need to stick at it to see results! All the best, I hope this has helped :) 

Chicken and Fish! Especially fish. Fish contain great deal of "good" fat and lots of protein. When you get hungry snack on nuts, protein shake, or protein bar. Lots of veggie. If you need rice, eat brown rice. I know it taste like plastic, but the best way is to put some scrushed seaweed seasoning on top (not too much). It'll make it taste better. 

I recommend push ups and crunches. 100 push up is a really popular workout for short period of time. One Hundred PUshups my man, give Plyometrics a good try it will not dissapoint you =) . i am not sure if this is considered spam but here is a simple 15 min workout link Plyo Please let me know after Plyometric what you think about working out HARD please =) 

I have seen fitness programs that focus six days of workout per week, and following three or four weeks have an entire recovery week. The term "recovery" is misleading, because you still workout six days a week, but it's just on a lighter weight. I am wondering why or if this week is needed. 

If you combine Plyometric sessions while maximizing the cardio side of it with minimal rest time, you can achieve high lung capacity. The small window of rest with these sessions will increase your heart rate and force your body to adjust to the right breathing pattern (of course done w/ moderation and safety in mind). Plyometric is considered a must in all athletic training. Soccer players recovering from ACL surgery participate in Plyometric to get back into competition shape. Plyometric will increase your performance in any sports including running if it is done right. 

What you are experiencing is a phenomenon that is related to cardiac drift - whereby if you were to run at a constant pace, you would see your heart rate increase over the run. This is due to the stress experienced by the body with prolonged exercise. However, the alternative is that if you keep a constant heart rate, then you will see the pace come down in order to keep the effort the same. As you run, you start to deplete your muscles of glycogen, up to a point at which you may notice your heart rate increase markedly - signalling depletion. You can improve your performance, resulting in heart rate stability, by running aerobically - that is, at an easy, comfortable pace (less than 75% HRMax). This allows for your muscles to adapt, resulting in more economic running - which is reflected by a faster pace for a given HR. So, to an extent, you will always see a tail-off in pace, or an increase in HR, however consistent aerobic training will have a marked effect on stabilising your pace. 

You will be surprised the benefits you will gain by running slower - you'll be exclusively working your aerobic system. Unless these partner-runs are replacing any hard workouts (tempos, intervals, etc.), then you may end up doing yourself more good than you realise - on the basis that easy running provides a good base. 

I think it depends on whether or not you want a chunky muscle body or a lean and ripped muscle body. I am not a body builder, nor have I ever trained to be one, but I have skimmed through the diets that some of them follow and I don't ever recall seeing fried eggs on those menus. In fact, typically they do eat a lot of eggs in the form of egg whites, but little to no egg yolk. If you're really serious about developing a muscle body, I recommend you train yourself to start incorporating egg whites into your diet. You can even buy them by the carton at most grocery stores. I've listed a few links to some articles that may interest you on this topic: Ava Cowan's Diet Plan (you'll see egg whites on the menu): $URL$ She doesn't describe how she prepares the eggs, but I doubt she fries her egg whites in butter. Recipes from Monica Brant (many include egg whites): $URL$ Lots of ideas here that don't involve frying: $URL$ I myself am a big fan of the Egg White Frittata. Below is a recipe I've never tried, but it looks quite good: $URL$ You'll find a lot of new and interesting diet strategies out there these days, but you asked about eggs, so I'll stop here. As always, exercise (and diet) at your own risk and see a doctor if you're concerned about your health or the diet you're about to follow. If you decide to stop eating fried eggs, with or without the yolk, I think most doctors would be okay with that. For further proof that frying may not be all that healthy, you may want to read this article here: $URL$ 

In terms of post-running nutrition, there are a lot of thoughts surrounding this - but there is one major theme, ensuring that you have carbohydrates to replace the energy you have used (refuelling), and protein for muscle repair (I can see that you already have eggs, and milk, which is good!). In terms of recovery, it is often touted that a 4:1 (or sometimes 3:1) carb:protein ratio is optimal, and that the protein should be consumed within an hour of finishing the run (as this is the time that it will have the most effect) - however, the body can only make use of so much protein per hour (based on your body weight), and different sources of protein act over different timescales (milk protein, for example, acts over a longer timescale than whey protein). Resources on websites such as RunnersWorld cover these topics. So, having established the composition of what you should be eating - it's a case of working out a good way of having a wholesome breakfast that incorporates this! As you run before breakfast, which naturally means your body is depleted, you must definitely ensure that you have carbs (porridge, etc) otherwise you may feel sluggish towards lunchtime as you increase your distance. Here is a nutrition section from RunnersWorld, $URL$ Here is an article for joint-health $URL$ Here is an article outlining the timings for protein intake $URL$ As you are just starting out running, these sorts of articles will help you on your way - I hope this helps, and all the best! 

Instead of doing consecutive push ups do them by sets of 2 or more. So if you can only do 20 at a time rest between sets. Do different types of push ups to increase endurance to your overall chest. Chest muscle requires time to heal so do chest once a week and make sure you give it good amount of rest time. Keep at it and make sure you keep track of it. Write them down how much you can do and compare them week to week. That way you know what you are capable and throwing in extra rep if you can each week. Eventually, you'll increase the amount you can do. Here are a list of different types of push ups you can do: standard shoulder width, wide, military, triangle push ups, plyo/clap push ups, decline, single arm push ups... If you want to build chest muscle + endurance there are types of push ups that focus mostly on slow movements and 4 seconds count down and 4 seconds count up with max rep. In addition you can mix slow movement push ups w/ standard once consecutively. That way you are confusing your chest muscle and increase peak performance. 

Is there a way to measure how much protein a person should consume per day based on their body weight? The objective is to burn fat and maximize metabolism.
