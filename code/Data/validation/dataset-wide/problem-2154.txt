Sure, that's fine to do. You could use a registered e-mail service like RPost. Send it to him (again) and send it to HR. RPost tracks delivery and viewing. $URL$ (I don't work for or have any relationship with RPost. But it's a handy service I've used in the past for stuff like this). 

7 pm really is too late. In recruiting firms, some staff have to start the day extra early to cover for applicants in multiple time zones. They want to go home and relax and enjoy a few hours' peace, just like you do. Aside from that, if you have a strong insistence on only dealing with the phone calls at that time, you're going to make the process painful for everyone else, INCLUDING the employer's staff -- who ALSO want to go home and leave work at work. I can't imagine a recruiter trying to get availability from you for a phone screen or interview, and the recruiter spending two or three days relaying that information between you and the client because you only want to take calls at a certain time. What's even more frustrating to think of is if the recruiter sets things up but has to contact you at the last minute because of scheduling changes with the client (it happens about 15% of the time)... and you're not answering calls. If you're the least flexible person in the process of moving toward a job, the recruiter and client may find no shortage of other applicants who may be less qualified but a whole lot easier to work with. 

You are no more obligated to inform managers of other opportunities as they are of informing you on other candidates. And we certainly can't tell you what to do. You may get two offers coinciding during the same span of time, or one will come and the other will take longer. Pick the one that will suit your lifestyle and needs, and be aware that money's not everything. Thank the other manager so that the next person in line can get the job, and good luck. All of this assumes that you have a formal offer - in writing. 

I share your pain! Ugh. It's a frustrating situation. I spent six months looking for a new opportunity. There were many presented, but I didn't feel that many of them were the right one, and that's why it took so long. With many of them, it was a process of hurry-and-wait. Hurry to get a phone interview. Wait for the next step. Some did a phone screen, and then had budget changes. Others had a long approval process for new headcount that had to be decided by an overseas office, and of course this little factoid didn't jibe with the recruiter's statement that the company wanted a new person "right away". I'll incorporate Starlight's suggestion. For a certain period of time, you really don't want to close any doors. But at some point when it starts to feel absurd, (i.e. YAY! It's interview number six!!!) I'd just stop responding to e-mails and phone calls. There's no benefit in being beaten into submission before you can even start the job. By this I mean a process where it's obvious you're being strung along. Some companies are looking for people who are desperate, because when a desperate person actually starts the job, he or she won't balk at "surprise" additionally unpaid responsibilities, or "surprise" salary cuts, or similar. It's just not a good place to start for a job where you intend to stay a while. Don't get stuck on one opportunity's potential. Keep digging on others. But if it's prolonged, do yourself a favor and take a break for a few weeks if it's starting to get you down; then you can come back refreshed. Best of luck. 

You should use the address of the registrar's office, because this is the only department that an employer would potentially be dealing with. Lots of employers don't even do the job of checking educational credentials themselves - they use a service with people who are experts at getting that information, and the staff at the service will likely have the required contact information already. Much of what you put on the application, beside the name of the school, is just a formality. 

This might warrant a write-up in the employee's HR file for creating or contributing to unhealthy or unsanitary conditions within the workplace. It's no different than bringing one's personal issues to work, or committing a crime there because it affects the morale of everyone around. So, get a paper trail started. 

No, it's not okay to lie, because your reputation is important. Guard it with your life. Reputation has to do with things that you do, but also things that you allow your client to do that may cost you later on, in terms of professional liability. You can't be forced to do the work. Remember that. You can also specify the conditions under which you'll be willing to do the work. In this case, you have a high-risk feature that your client wants to be done in a certain way. To an extent, that's fine. Your client's not asking for anything illegal or unethical - just stupid. So here's what you do: 

At any moment of the day, you can go to the "Gigs" section on Craiglist in any major city and see so-called "opportunities" for worker-bees with startups. Most offer low or no pay and a whole lot of promises, just as the OP here is attempting to do. They come, and they go. These posts have been on Craigslist for years and years. Any person with an inkling of their own self-worth is not going to help line the pockets of OP and the bosses, and then still have to worry about their own life expenses after doing so. It's worse in major cities, where twenty-somethings can't even afford to live on their own due to the high rents. The freelancing idea introduces risk. All it'd take is one 1099 employee getting hurt on the job; the state gets involved, decides that ALL of them are not "independent", and demands some tax money from the still-struggling business, and it's all over. Perhaps a better approach would be to actually pay the people what they're worth, which might involve making pay cuts from OP and the management. It's unrealistic to leave all the struggling to the people on the bottom - if you're not looking to share the weight, they won't either. 

Before you concern yourself about getting out of the work, take a step back for a second. Obviously, you're qualified to do more complex work than tech support. That's good. But you aren't assertive enough, or it wouldn't have gone this far. The real problem is that when you got asked to do something beyond your job description, you accepted it without demanding more pay. In short -- with all due respect -- you have marked yourself as a "sucker". If you were running a business, you could simply charge more, or have the power to decline the work if a client refused to pay a higher rate. But in this job situation, the boss has the power to fire you for something not even in your job description. And unfortunately, you have created this situation for yourself by being passive and demonstrating that you are okay with being abused. It may prove to to be very, very difficult at this point. I don't get the idea that negotiating with your boss is going to work. You may be able to go to HR or your boss's boss in order to explain your case. If they ignore you, or tell you it's going to take a long time to figure out, or that there's no more money (but expect the same work) you'll probably have no choice but to find a new job. If you're ready for more money and challenging work, take a programming job! (yay!) The NEXT time around, don't volunteer so much if you aren't sure the company is willing to pay for it. If you are asked, "do you know how to do XYZ?" and it's not on your job description, play as if you are dumb unless it's clear that you will be paid what you're worth. 

If I were you, I'd consider a criminal restraining order against A. Considering the pending charges, and the fact that you witnessed the incident and have to work in close proximity, it's probably more than justifiable with a judge. Your health AND livelihood are at risk until this gets worked out. This is the least you can do to protect yourself. When A can't show up to work because of the restraining order, allow A to do the explaining and you just go on with your life as best you can. 

So if this is the case, then apparently no one is interested in "saving" an underperforming team member, and the OP is going to have to either dig herself out, find a new job, or wait around to get fired. 

They are pushy because often they're trained that way. Especially the newbies. Some are trained to work by a script, in which they ask you how your other interviews are going EVERY time you have a conversation. In this scenario, they're actually looking for new leads. It's not you. Newbie recruiters work hard, get paid little, and have extremely high turnover; they may get a little financial reward for being the person who finds new opportunities. Another version of this is them asking for references way early in the process. They're going to use those contacts for "mining". As for making a decision on your offer - don't fall for the total BS line that you won't have much time. It's no different than watching infomercials and having the announcer say, "Act now!" Of course, the recruiters want you to make a decision in their favor, and the sooner you do, the sooner they can get paid!!! 

Translation: You're a lukewarm candidate that may get a "pass" with certain clients of ours who barter in soft skills more than technical competency. Please allow us to keep you on a short leash, while you pass up opportunities while thinking that us telling you that we like you means we're actually thinking of you first. Conclusion Every recruiting company has some spin to keep applicants from being turned off. This is a "nice" one that hints of some kinship between you and the recruiter, but still it's an industry that's all about placing bodies to make money. Don't get stuck on one person's half-promises!!! 

You may have to cut your losses. In the context of the game, your co-worker all about making the interaction convenient to himself, and he has a problem with any other outcome. I don't know exactly what game you're playing (WOW?) but as a former WOW player, I understand that part of group-type interaction in such games simply requires each player to be logged in and "available" when someone announces some group-type fun. After an announcement, some people will make it in time, and others will miss out (including anyone who was even a little distracted at the moment) -- and that's just the nature of the game. You asked him to not whine about something he can't control, and he had a hissy fit. In my opinion, you enforced a very healthy boundary for the sake of the group (the guild). There's nothing to apologize about. If he won't speak to you on a friendly basis at work now, just let him be. Acknowledge that his short fuse is something that's been cultivated long before you came into the picture. It's awkward, indeed. But it's not your job to try to coax him out of his self-imposed exile. Maybe he will snap out of it, and maybe he won't. I'd say that you just do your best to not add any fuel to the fire - specifically, this means that if anyone at work asks about the obvious rift between the two of you, you take the high road and avoid disparaging him. Sometimes hands-off is the best you can do. 

It was thrown at you AFTER you started work, and after your other employment prospects were told you'd taken a job You risk losing your employment if you don't sign it You are an individual party, being challenged by a business (I presume) with lots more money than you. It severely impedes your ability to have any financial livelihood or ownership outside work. 

Ask her - in a better situation, what would the environment in the office be like? How would she feel? (if this applies) Would the business process in the office be any different? What are obstacles that are preventing that? Devise a plan of action to get through the obstacles. Start with low-hanging fruit. She may need some external counseling. Make her accountable for doing the work to get through the obstacles. (This part goes in her HR file). You may unearth other obstacles along the way - be prepared to re-prioritize if need be. 

Okay, so you were heated. Breaking away was the right approach. But instead of telling him to stop, you could have just got up and left. That way, he would not get MORE defensive by way of you giving him an order. Food choices are becoming as work-inappropriate as religion. "Vegan" is a touchy word! (Substitute it with Christian, Muslim, Democrat, Republican, or LGBT, and you get the same outcome). If you are going to apologize, apologize for not getting up to leave. Don't expect anything from him, as he apparently felt quite strongly. And never, never get into such a conversation again - bite your lip; change the subject. "Oh my, how about those Lakers?" lol 

Bring your personal laptop, and hotspot (or tether your phone) and find something to do in that time. Don't attract attention (social networking). Look as if you are occupied. Study some new technologies that interest you, and do some tutorials. But avoid doing "project" work on their dime. The agency can't do anything, nor can the manager because the clearance process is out of their hands. So don't be a pest. Be patient, and collect your check. This is par for the course. 

That person doesn't work for you. Unless you are in a marketing or PR department where reviewing this material is part of your job, leave it alone - you are overstepping. You don't want a reputation as that person in the office who's a pain in the rear. 

First, I'm going to assume your e-mail address won't change -- so that's always an alternative. Do what Chris G said. But if you're paranoid about missing the phone call, get something like a Google Voice number, and put that on the CV. It will forward incoming calls to your new number. Voila!
