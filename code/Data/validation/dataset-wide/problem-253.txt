Your question seems to be assuming a behind-the-scenes scheming approach (not necessarily meant in a bad way; whether it is good or bad is a matter of opinion). Your question can be answered more simply if you are willing to take a more direct approach. If your king is of reasonable power, he can directly contradict or even war against whatever he opposes. Other answers here have already mentioned kings who fought against the catholic establishment, so I will skip the rest of this case. The one case which is under-represented here is the powerful king who can do whatever he wants. Fortunately for me, this case does not need much explanation: the king is powerful enough that he can do whatever he wants. There are rulers in history who have done exactly this, religiously. Generally this was not used to remove the dominance of religion overall; instead it was used to change the dominance from one religion to another, or to another form of the same religion. Notably, in Egypt and Japan the rulers claimed that they, themselves, were gods. That might be an oversimplification in Japan's case, which I am not as familiar with, but my layman's understanding is that the Japanese emperor was revered as a deity. In the case of the Egyptian pharaohs, however, it was fairly simple: pharaohs could just pronounce that they, or someone close to them, was a god and this was to be accepted. This was likely accepted with lip-service only by many people, no matter how powerful the ruler, and we do have historical accounts of people who refused to pay such lip-service to their rulers. One such famous account even ended well for the subjects: Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon demanded to be worshipped, but Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego refused, stating that their god would be with them. The king, furious, had these three thrown into a large, super-hot furnace (reportedly so hot that it killed the guards who threw in the prisoners), but they were protected by a fourth figure who could be seen walking in the blazing furnace with them. The king, astonished by the miracle he witnessed, did a complete 180 and ordered everyone to worship the god of the Hebrews. So everyone went in short order from worshipping whoever they were worshipping before, to worshipping the king via his statue he set up, to worshipping the god of the Hebrews, all in short order because of royal degree. Power reigns in a land lacking in mutual respect, neighborly love, and honor/kindness. In such a place, whatever the entity with the power says is what goes. 

The answer is rather simple, and it lies in our very humanity itself. Humans all have different opinions and reactions. 

A capital starship could be hardened against EM attack by hardening it literally; just add more mass. Taking your examples, I am assuming you are not including EM of sufficient power and focus to be used as a gun for destroying your ship outright (ie: high powered laser to blast through your hull), but rather for jamming, overloading via EMP, etc.. Just put enough mass on the outer portions of your ship and it will block practically all of the energy. It could be something like lead, but it could also just be water. And it does not have to be the outermost part of the ship either; it just needs to outside of where the delicate things needing protection are. You could surround only specific compartments if you wanted to: the bridge, datacenter, and a few other things. Attenuation is the reduction in intensity of the light beam (or signal) with respect to distance travelled through a transmission medium. The beauty of this is that it absorbs a broad frequency spectrum. If my understanding of faraday cages is correct, they will have a much shorter spectrum over which they work. What you need to do is decide which EM frequencies are likely used in your scenario then check to see how far they penetrate into various substances. The penetration if deep enough (not blocked trivially) may be measured in some "half-distance" (analogous to radiation half-life) type of unit, generally attenuation coefficient. So if a certain EM frequency you are worried about has a half-distance of 1 meter in water (based on its attenuation coefficient for that EM frequency), then 1 meter of water will block out about half of it, 2 meters will block 75%, 4 meters 87.5%, and so on. So you put your bridge in the middle of your water reserve so that you have 15 meters of water surrounding you and you block 95% of the energy. At that point, if a few percent of the energy at some frequency left over is still a concern, you use some other method to absorb, reflect, or otherwise deal with the remaining bit. Such as the faraday cage mentioned by @cypher designed for the frequencies you are worried about that are still getting through a little bit. 

Though a true answer lies after, I will start by answering your question with a question to put my answer into perspective: Mock question 

The Generic Answer That addresses the body of your question. But the title, and some aspects of the body, also seem to be asking a more general question: If there were some utopian website that did exist, and if that website's principles were applied to physical, real-world governance, could the real state likewise be a utopia? The answer to that question would be a bit different. Since we have no first-hand records of any people documenting any nation in a state of utopia, and I know of no large groups of people who even collectively agree about how to bring about a utopia, it is difficult to know. In fact, it might be impossible to answer this question: if we cannot even agree how to bring about a utopia at all, even in theory, then is it even possible to discuss how to transfer the principles from one medium to another? I'm not sure. 

The way your question is set up, it does not sound like planet B would become a molten core at all. If planet A surrounds B in the manner described, B will be gravitationally pulled outward by A, the gravity will reduce B's pressure inward, not raise it. If you are thinking that A's gravity is so strong that B is fully pulled apart and is itself hollow, a hollow molten core pushing outward along the inner wall of the hollow planet A because the hollow cavity is large enough and A's crust thick enough for that much gravity, I don't think that would happen either, and even if it did then B would not be a separate planet anymore but rather would be part of planet A. Explanation The pressures within our planet which contribute to our molten core would not be possible if it were not for the fact that all the rest of the world is sitting on top of it. In the case of your hollow world, nothing will be weighing upon planet B. Planet B can be considered a normal planet just like any other, and therefore treated as any other with its own normal geology, with the exception that it has the inner wall of another planet overhead. The following assumes A is roughly spherical with a roughly spherical cavity which itself is centrally located within planet A. Now remember, even though the center of mass of A is at the center of its hollow cavity, B is being attracted to the matter of planet A, so it is actually being attracted outward. For a sufficiently large planet A, this could even result in a planet B rolling around the inner cavity wall of A. For a planet B stabilized at the center of mass of A such that it is suspended in the center of the cavity, increasing the gravity will not pull B apart. If you increase A's gravity sufficiently, it would merely pull B out of its stabilized position with the entirety of B "falling" out toward some random direction and leave you with something more like the previous paragraph before this one. Caveat That said, there is a catch to what I said, something that might still be close to what you are after, in a way. If B settles down (down is subjective here; I am meaning toward the surface of a sphere halfway between A's outer surface and inner cavity surface), and if A's crust is sufficiently thick that B can undergo similar geological activity within A just as our core does in Earth, then it could still become molten given the right conditions. However, there are now a few issues:
