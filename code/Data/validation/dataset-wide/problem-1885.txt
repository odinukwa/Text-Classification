The keys would be how well can you give the context of what was the project, what made it hard and what did you learn from it among other things. The interviewer is seeing whether or not you'd speak negatively about the project or a past employer, how well do you know your weaknesses, what have you done about them and how would you handle this situation should it happen again in the future. There are more than a few mines you could hit here that lower your chances of getting the job. 

Yes, though be careful about phrasing your justification for deserving a higher salary. If you state that their currently employed designer is worse directly that could backfire on you. There may be various replies that are worth being prepared to see like if they suggest having a performance review at various points would that bring you down or would you hold firm? Just something to consider. 

To take the US example a bit further, if you were planning to get in under an H1-B visa, these tend to hit the cap rather quickly. H-1B Cap Reached Today; Didn't Get In? Too Bad notes for April 5, 2013: 

If you want to appear difficult, you could go this route. The company wants to know what kind of rates you expect so that you aren't sent on jobs you'd turn down because they don't compensate adequately. If you make $60,000/year and a job comes up that pays $15,000/year there is little chance you'd want that job and though this is why they need to know an expected salary. 

Some companies may deal in national secrets that if you are outside the US could be a violation of various export/import rules. Thus, if something had to be shipped to you but couldn't leave the physical US, this creates a problem now doesn't it? While you could come pick it up, what if the border doesn't let it outside the country? At the same time, another factor here is if you had to show up, how long would it take to get you there? If you are flying from Chicago to New York that is one thing, but Lima to New York could be a bit harder to arrange. 

Yes, I know various non-technical people that do a lot with LinkedIn as some may maintain groups, send messages or use it as away to build themselves up. After all, look at the Influencers on LinkedIn and most of business people or celebrities and not the IT gurus. 

The recruiter means that they intend to maintain a relationship with you by giving you a phone call or e-mail in a few months to see where you are. Perhaps at that time you could want to explore opportunities or require their services to fill a position where you currently work that could be a win-win. 

Could you work in questions rather than instructions in your work conversations? From How to Win Friends and Influence People that may be useful here, particularly #4: 

If you know that a deadline will be missed, I'd suggest informing your manager as soon as possible and see what course of action is recommended. Perhaps there will be a power struggle or something else here, but there may be alternatives. There is also the question of how do deadlines get handled within the company as I've seen everything from everyone in the company help meet the deadline to deadlines are just hopeful dates that don't mean anything. 

Depending on your geography, reputation, plan and other things, I could imagine a wide range of possible answers. If you are in the top .0001% of programmers worldwide, I'd think it may be possible to get companies bidding to have you come to them. However, if you aren't in that top ballpark, don't have a big network and don't have a niche you may have issues. 

You communicate what you mean by "learn fast" in giving examples of where you've done this. What evidence do you have for that claim? Do you have proof of this or do you just believe this without any proof that would convince someone? Be careful how you handle critics as that may cause more issues since if someone is a little hostile to you that you offer childish antics? What you state here is what will be used here. You aren't the administrator of this site so be careful of how mighty you think you are. 

I see this as a question of how creative, adaptable and persistent someone is in handling the case of what does work versus what should work. There can be steps taken to solve a problem that in some cases may need to be handled differently. To give an example from Software Development in regards to fixing a bug. If the bug is found in a testing environment, I may have a process of reproducing the bug, looking for various solutions, making a short list of options that I hand to a manager to determine which makes the most sense from a business perspective and then implement the fix, test it, get a code review and then commit to the version control for the next push. However, if there is a bug found in production that has to be fixed immediately, I may change this approach as I may not have time to do things with so much bureaucracy to it. I may jump into finding the bug, changing the code, get it reviewed and then pushed into production in an expedited way. The question has a few pieces to consider as there is something to be said for how big of a change is there, what caused the change to be done and what was learned from this new approach. 

Yes that would how I'd interpret that. Check your employment agreement to see if there are clauses about "moonlighting" or what you create outside of working hours as in some cases this may be owned by the company. 

How to Win Friends and Influence People has some ideas that I'd suggest you carefully consider these ideas: 

On the first point, I'd consider more carefully what are you really wanting for a fix here? Are you wanting there to be another "All Hands" meeting where your praises can be sung just because you feel left out? I could see setting up a meeting with the manager and asking, "Why didn't I get mentioned in the All Hands meeting?" so that you could see how are you perceived as you describe yourself here as the hardest working person that deserves some kudos. To say that they are wrong for leaving you out is ignoring what view they may have had in seeing things from a different angle. Have you considered that while you may do a lot this is what the company sees as "normal" from you that may not be the same as what is expected of others? A conversation with you asking questions to see their perspective would go over way better than being the baby that wants attention and feels slighted here. On the second one, this I see differently. Your direct manager told you, "You are doing better than everyone else," and somehow that isn't good? Really? You may want to consider having the conversation about what company recognition programs are there, what you want on a regular basis and how close are you to being promoted. Econ 101 management is somewhat old but still relevant about gaming the system. % Authorship may not be as big a deal in some ways as some people may reduce the amount of code by removing code smells that how is this accounted for properly? How are design decisions rewarded if it is just the amount of code that counts at the end of the day? On the last point, I'd ask the manager, "What do I have to do in order to be promoted?" so that you can get an answer of what skills are they wanting to see as perhaps it is different than your perspective.
