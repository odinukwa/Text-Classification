I know many folks who have a small mirror attached to their computer monitor so that they can see people who walk up behind them. These mirrors are usually small and come with a self-adhesive strip that attached them to the corner of your monitor. They can be very inexpensive. It seems perfectly normal to me. And I've never heard anyone say that it was inappropriate. I suppose in some offices it would be frowned on, but none that I've ever seen. 

Well, they say "there are no stupid questions". So from that point of view you can ask anything. But I'd be shocked if a tiny company would commit to, or even comment on, future years' salaries in anything other than extremely general terms. In my experience, five years is an eternity for this size company, and nobody would try to predict salaries that far out. You might hear something like "We tend to pay market rates." I wouldn't expect much more than that. Of course who knows what the market rates might be in five years? I've worked at a good handful of small startup companies. If you came to me with that question, I'd say something like "Well, that depends on lots of factors - some of which are in your control, some of which are in my control, and many of which neither of us can control." Then I'd point out that you should work as hard as you can in order to give you the best chance at the best salary and that this was pretty much the only part you could control. In larger companies, I might review the company's formal process for determining and granting raises. I'd describe the meetings, the reviews, the levels of approval, etc. But I'd never give you numbers, that would be foolish. And in most cases, since the numbers are derived from annual budgets and budgets are seldom set up far ahead of time, I couldn't know the numbers anyway. So if you are looking for hard and fast numbers, I'd suggest that you not waste your time. 

You are seeing this as a two-sided coin. Either you work hard or you enjoy your life. In most cases it's easily possible to do both. When I was younger, I worked a lot, attended school at night, got ahead, and still enjoyed my life tremendously. I love my family, love my life, and I loved my work as well. It worked out very well for me in my career and I wouldn't change a thing. Perhaps being let go from your previous job hurt so much that it has made you wary that all employers will spurn you. Thus you decide to work just as much as required and no more. You can probably continue to do that and have a decent career. Or you can decide to take a chance that your current employer is right and that hard work can get you ahead. As always, it's your choice. 

Send your resume. And send a cover letter stating your salary requirement. As always, the cover letter should mention the job you are applying for, why you would be a good fit, and should convey your excitement about the possibility of working for the company. As @Lilienthal correctly points out, when there isn't a specific job posting, your cover letter would instead talk about the kind of profile you have and how your skills and experience would be valuable for the company Basically, the employer's website is indicating that they want to be sure you include both your resume and salary requirement. They aren't saying that's all you are allowed to send. And if you decide not to include your salary requirement, they will almost certainly reject your application. 

A consulting gig should be all positive. There is no need to sound negative if you are there to help them understand if "innovation" is for them. If it is - that's positive. If it isn't - it's a positive thing that they have learned that about themselves before wasting any time or money. Condescending is an attitude - don't have that attitude. Consultants/Contractors should never badmouth their former clients! Your next potential client will simply suspect that you will do the same to them once your contract is over. Don't be that guy. 

Just having a friendly discussion will often give you the answers you need without having to be so direct and so negative. 

Reading through your question leads me to believe you already know what you want to do. You want to leave, but want to wait for the 1-year mark before doing so. So go ahead and do what you know you want to do - the offer is on the table. I'm not sure that waiting for the magic 1-year mark makes any real difference. 5 months won't really matter to future hiring managers. If it were me, I'd just resign now, and give an appropriate notice period to your current employer. It could be hard to give your full attention to your current job when you know it ends in 5 months or less. Whatever you decide, think about this - jobs aren't static and situations change. If a team member leaves unexpectedly, others may be required to pitch in and help for a while. Even in your new company it will be unrealistic to expect everything discussed during the interview to stay the same forever. A 3-5 year grooming period might well turn into an 8+ year period if your acquaintance decides that she isn't as eager to retire as she thought. A comfortable work week might turn into a 70 hour position if your acquaintance decides to ease into partial retirement now and require the Director of Operations to pick up the slack. And your personal situation changes, too. Going into a job requiring weekend work may be fine in the beginning, but a change in the family situation may mean that no longer fits your needs. These things happen. Jobs change. People change. We need to be able to deal with it as it happens. 

In my part of the world there are many thousands of agencies who would be happy to help. A quick Google search should easily find many. 

There's no real way to know for sure. It's possible that asking questions in private and without the lecturing tone would have gone over better. That said, she was there almost 7 years longer than you, and presumably has more insight than you did. If you were still working there, you could have spent more time with her and learned more about the company as it actually was. 

In one company, prior to my exit interview, I specifically asked who would be allowed to see the notes the HR rep was making. I asked if I mentioned individuals, would they read my comments. Her answer was "No". The comments were for her and wouldn't be shared with the individuals. They would be summarized, and the overall thoughts and tone might be shared with relevant managers. If a pattern of problems were detected with individuals, the appropriate managers would be notified, and a discussion could take place. But I was assured that my specific comments would not be shared with the named individuals, and the summaries would not have my name attached to them. These things tend to be locale-specific (and perhaps company-specific). If some comments have been made about you during exit interviews that have led to repercussions, you should call or walk over and talk with HR to find out what specific rights you may or may not have here. The HR reps will almost certainly know what is permitted and what is not. If you are simply trying to get a general sense of the issues and tone (without needing to see the verbatim comments), HR can almost certainly provide that for you. Rather than just asking that the comments be forwarded, ask if you can have a meeting to understand the issues being conveyed.
