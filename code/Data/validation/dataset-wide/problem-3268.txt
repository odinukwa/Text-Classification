President Johnson in 1963 still had never won a national election. He had never even competed in a national election as head of the ticket. Now he was President, Leader of the political machine which Kennedy had built; only the Kennedy's hated him. So five days after President Kennedy was shot; on Nov 27, 1963; as the entire country mourned, on national TV, in his first address to a joint session of congress; President Johnson ties the legacy of the dead president and the 1964 civil rights bill to his own campaign for President. 

Washington Employed many spies in the Revolutionary War. The most successful of which was the Culper Spy Ring, none of whom were ever apprehended. Captured Documents, first hand accounts of preparations or British actions from spies were all actionable information. Sources:. George Washington Spy Master.

source On the smaller case.. The encircled (A) means the shell has been fired once. The two adjacent punch marks are given for each subsequent firing. So this shell has been fired 3 times. This was a way the English designates there shells, so it's an English shell. The C.FFF has to do with the Charge load. It was fired with full charge, loaded with cordite again all 3 times. Can't really make out much more.. On the larger case.. I can't match up any symbols. 

So It's true that FDR didn't know what he was doing economically. But it's also clear with 20/20 hindsight that Hoover and his consensus of respected economic experts didn't understand the economy either. What's also clear was FDR understood what he didn't know and was fast to make corrections when his policies failed. Hoover took years to question his failed policies. Not until re-election pressures forced his hand did he alter his economic approach in 1931. 

Short Answer.. There was no naval arms race in the 20's, on the contrary both Britain and the United States would enter into parity agreement which would call for significant naval draw downs from 1922 - 1937. Nobody!. Well, Nobody without an agenda, thought their would be a war between the United States and Great Britain. There were a few people on both sides of the Atlantic talking up the threat in an unsuccessful attempt to get more funding for their own Navy's, both of which were on the precipice of a large draw down from the political majorities of both countries. Great Britain politically powerful Navy was not happy about accepting parity and massive draw down. The United States Navy also had it's supporters talking up the need for American to fully fund parity with the British Navy. Both efforts were unsuccessful. Great Britain, certainly did not desire a war with the United States. Great Britain was weary of war, and her politicians were unwilling to support the existing British Navy much less finance an arms race. The United States leadership balked at funds even approaching parity with what the British were willing to spend. The United States and United Kingdom had just concluded WWI(4/6/1917 - 11/11/1918) where they were close allies against an existential enemy. The friendly governmental relationships between the two nations paled only in comparison to the close cultural historic and business relationships of the two peoples. For the years (1900, 1913, 1928, 1935, 1938, the UK was the United States largest trading partner. More than half of all US annual Exports during the interwar period went to the UK see Table XXIV - 1 ) The US banking system and that of the United Kingdom were tied together with many hundreds of millions of dollars in loans. There was no naval race in the 1920's. As I said before, World War I ended in November 1918 and all the great sea faring nations had large Wartime Navy's. Great Britain owned half the dread naughts on the sea at the end of WWI. The challenge wasn't to build larger Navy's, the challenge was to disarm in an organized way to ensure stability. Before an arms race could occure, the five greatest sea faring nations got together to ensure their would be no "possibility of an Naval arms race". The United States Secretary of State (Charles Evans Hughes) calling all the major Naval powers to the(Conference of Washington 1921-1922) 

In many languages, the general term for distilled spirits (whisky, brandy etc) translates in modern English to 'Water of Life'. 

Christianity in particular arose out of the Roman period when most people were trying to figure out the nature of the universe in lieu of any scientific evidence. When Christianity was coming into being there were innumerable religious sects throughout the Roman world, all competing with each other. By chance Christianity was the sect that grew, but the reason people believed in it was because it was an answer. In the modern world educated people take scientific knowledge for granted, in the ancient world this understanding did not exist, it was inconceivable. Without the ability to come to an accurate understanding people developed mythology. 

This is something that I've been researching for the past few weeks and have found a few answers, but I assume I'm missing a few of them. Basically, the question is this: In which ways have modern historians defined our current era? Not sure how to tag this one if mods could do an edit that'd be great. Edit: The duplicate that was proposed seems to be asking about the distinction between the classical eras historians have defined we are currently living in. Whereas I'm interested in any and all definitions that historians have proposed, which may be more esoteric and obscure than the obvious ones like 'modern' and 'information age' 

I've been reading about the Warring States Period in Li Feng's 'Early China', and I don't know if I missed a passage but I can't seem to figure out why the period was so violent. I've been searching via Google but still I seem to be getting a lot of information on the dynamics of war, but not exactly why the wars happened in the first place. So a few questions about that: 

Moving backwards in time, can all of the religious families be isolated to their own common ancestor? If so, what are the religious ancestors, and in what regions did they arise? 

This question may need some work, but I'll do my best.. I remember hearing a while back that much of the history of India occurred in isolation. Without knowing whether this is strictly true, it got me to thinking about parallel social traits that have arisen independently in different regions of the world. One of the more interesting social traits is religion. We know that religion is ever evolving, breaking into further sects and so on, and we know that most people throughout history have had a tendency to ask 'why'. So my assumption is that if you take all of the religions which exist today and trace their lineage backwards, you'll find a set of ancestors of 'religious families' which came to be independently of each other. So what I wonder is: 

(-1-) The reason why the Sarissa Pike requires larger formations was because of it's length. It was twice as long as a normal hoplite spear. In a typical phalanx any foe approaching the phalanx would be faced with layers of spear tips to contend with. The longer spear's advantage was in part due to more layers. The longer spear meant people in the fifth row could use their spear tips against a closing enemy. But this required their be a fifth row of spearmen. Larger base formations meant slower overall units, which were less flexible, more susceptible to difficulties with terrain, but they were also heavier, better protected, and better able to smash smaller enemy units matched against them on even terrain. 

I'm going to chime in because I have a point to make I've not seen presented, and it's a great question. (1) Roosevelt was better educated and read than most Americans. (2) This allowed him to recognize the Nazi's for who they were earlier than most of the people he lead. I would say that Roosevelt was an interventionist firstly because he was better informed. Roosevelt was fluent in German and French. He could both read and write the languages. Most of what Americans knew about Hitler and the Nazi's came from the American Newspapers or the sanitized version of Mein Kampf which was translated and sold in the US in the late 1930's. Roosevelt read both the original German version, and the new English translation of Hitler's first book. 

Personal Attacks Washington’s and Jefferson’s political views were diverging through the time the US Constitution was being ratified Sept 1887 - June 1788, but after Jefferson accepted a position (Secretary of State) in the Washington Administration(March 22, 1790 – December 31, 1793) their discord would become personal, even to the point of being considered Treason (*). (*)At the time neither Alexander Hamilton's Federalists nor Jefferson's Republican Democrats favored a loyal opposition two party system which we have today. Working inside of the government, to sabotage the government was widely seen by Federalists including George Washington as Treason, giving aid and comfort the the nations enemies. 

Winfield Scott George McClellan: (1861-1862) John Pope(1862) Ambrose Burnside (1862-1863) Joseph Hooker(1863) George Meade(1863-1864) Ulysses S. Grant 

Also the emperor was not the primary target of the coup. The primary target was the surrender speech which the Emperor had recorded earlier and which were to be played on the radio to announce the already agreed upon surrender to the Japanese people. The conspirators believed if they could stop the recorded broadcast they would win supporters to their cause and ultimately for his own good, gain control of the emperor without directly confronting him which would have been political suicide. Soldiers claiming to have a higher understanding of the Emperor's beliefs was not uncommon among Japans solders refusing the orders of their superiors. Such a soldier directly confronting or threatening the Emperor would have been very uncommon. Anyway not a very well thought out coup. 

As a hobbyist in fine alcohol I'm curious of both the earliest known reference to this phrase, as well as it's likely origins, but the best I can come up with is 'likely much earlier than the Medieval period' from Wikipedia. 

I'm more of a social historian than military historian, but if I understand correctly war between two factions is almost always a struggle for power. Is that the case? Are there examples of wars started for other reasons? Edit: There were some comments about the vagueness of the term power so I'm going to try to be more specific about it. By 'struggle for power', I mean: 

I've read detailed social history on Scotland which goes back to about the 16th century, and it would seem like some of the poorest Scots of that era sometimes lived in housing which was as modest as mud / dirt huts. If I'm understanding correctly the medieval era saw a very gradual rise of the town and city, or in other words civilization, so my assumption would be that early medieval society may have been closer to tribal and very primitive. In any case, that brings me to the question of how people in early medieval Europe housed themselves, with Scotland as my case study. How did people in the current state of Scotland house themselves in the early medieval period? 

As far as I understand it from David Christian's 'Maps of Time', civilization is a direct function of population density. When groupings of people in any given geographic area can no longer support themselves via hunting/gathering, they need to intensify their ability to extract resources from the region, which results in agriculture, which results in a more sedentary lifestyle, which results in food surpluses, which results in civilization. So the answer to your question is likely something like: there were no populations dense enough yet to necessitate the need for robust agriculture, which would form a complex social structure, which we deem as civilization Tying it in with the ice age is something that I'm not as clear about. I wonder, though, if the diminishing of the ice age produced conditions where people could more easily thrive and see population growth, which led to the various agricultural revolutions you mention. 

I understand that this sounds even more vague than the term power itself, but that's exactly the point of the question. I wonder if you can reduce human conflict to power conflict. 

I'm not clear on number one being the case, and if it is I'm not sure which played a more prominent role in drinking alcohol. Did most people drink alcohol to avoid getting sick, or were they just drunks like us?
