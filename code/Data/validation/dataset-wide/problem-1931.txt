But get approval from management as they may not support that policy. Many people don't care about water enough to refill so they wait for people like you that do care enough about water to refill. Consider it your contribution to office hydration. 

I recently got a take home test. It was full blown application that needed to connect to a socket server that had to simulate a slow feed. Client had up update dynamically, be able to cancel the feed, and write and read XML. I kind of want to learn sockets anyway as I am thinking about using them for a poker server I am writing. I wanted to learn XMLreader and XMLwriter. At first I thought forget it. But then I saw it as a chance to prove what I can do. I don't have a CS degree so I miss some theoretical stuff. They asked what are the 3 pillars of OOP and wanted to say who cares. My message is people that want the job should complete the test. 

In many jurisdictions yes it matters. In US you can only get unemployment if you were laid off. With layoffs a company may be required to pay a higher unemployment tax. On a resume they may trust a layoff was not a performance issue on your part. If they have your resignation and then have a layoff I suspect they would not include you in the layoff as no benefit to the company that I can think of. If you suspect the layoff would be with some severance benefits then you can hold off for a layoff but you have an offer in hand so you cannot really hold off. 

If what you state is accurate then you did nothing wrong and VP over reacted. At this point it sounds like you are collateral damage and they don't care. VP is clearly not going to take the blame. You might survive but you should start looking for another job. 

If you have lost your spot then you have lost your spot. Your boss may have wanted you back but there must be an open position to put you in. If all positions were full then it would have been polite of HR to tell you that but that does not always happen. You shopped around and put yourself at risk. You have communicated to them that they were likely not your first choice. Things may have changed since you boss said "summertime got closer". I would wait a week and send an email to both. 

You don't have job offer so right now so you don't have a salary to negotiate. When you get an offer it will either be acceptable or not. If not make a counter. You are not really in a position to argue your worth in the market. They know what they pay their people. They know the market. Don't lecture them on the market. If they are low balling you they may accept your counter. A good company will have a pretty tight pay range. If you perform and move up and then your pay increases. If you like the company and the offer exceeds or meets your initial expectation then just consider going with it. 

I doubt the the next set up cubicles is shushing for no reason. If you are having a quite conversation IN a cubicle it should not carry over to the next set of cubicles. If are talking across cubicles that is not good cubicle etiquette. Go to the cubicle or pick up the phone. For sure the next group should not have to hear your personal conversations - if the next set of cube knows you went to the game last night then yes they can expect quiet. If everyone did that you would not even be able to talk on the phone. I worked in a group where one pair would talk all day long across cubicles and it filled the whole room. It was just rude. We asked them to stop and they did not so we went to management. We had a guy that would take every phone call on speaker at max volume and the whole room would have to hear every word. Rude, pick up the phone and understand you are in a cubicle. If everyone did that it would it would have been a roar in the office. If you are having quite conversations in a cube and by the time it gets to the next set up cubes it is just a muffle then yes they need to mellow. If you are having conversions across cubes business or personal then that is rude. If you are in an office where everyone is OK with it then fine but this is a whole group and they want to work. If you are marketing and need to have open exchange then they would not have moved you in next to accounting. 

Don't mean to beat up on you but your depiction of programming knowledge is naive. Syntax is easy. Look up syntax is easy. What is hard to know is what to look up. When would you use a Task versus a Thread? LINQ has been around a few years but I bet it was not around when you were in college. When would you use EF versus SQLLINQ versus raw TSQL? Have you used message queue? I code C# full time for the last 10 years and I don't know all the features. 4 years ago I was full time ASP.NET. I am not up to speed on any of the new stuff. It would take me a month to get up to 1/2 speed and 4-6 months to get fully up to speed with the new stuff. Employers are demanding the new stuff because consumers are demanding the new stuff. Consumer may not know what asyc is but they know when the UI freezes. I suggest you drop the attitude and come up to speed on the latest features. 

Yes you should report your actual degree. To not do so is fraud. Just because it is a term they might not know is not a reason the change. Let them have the chance to ask you or look it up. If you use Bachelor to give the impression of a 4 year degree and they look at your resume and discover it is 3 year degree and you did not accurately report the degree you will be immediately eliminated as a candidate. 

Conspiracy to distribute a schedule 3 is breaking the law but it is not up there with dealing heroin. Plead out with no jail time would have a minimal impact on many people. But it went down as a felony. A felony is going to hit harder in some professions. For example law, medicine, and IT. Reason for IT sensitivity is that you have assess to data. And you could wreak havoc. If they ask you need to tell them. Even if they don't ask maybe you should tell them. A friend of mine had a DUI and the new employer did not ask but when they tried to put her on the insurance policy the DUI came up and she was dismissed. Look for stuff that stays away from enterprise data as that is going to be very protected. Not really Java but games. But working in games is brutal. Look for stand alone apps. Not something to put on the resume but during the interview process you might ask about hiring polices and background checks under the guise of how long does it take. Requiters talk to each other and you don't want to get flagged as a felon. Give yourself a chance to get out without showing your hand. I don't really know what the right answer is here. Just trying to give you some ideas. 

Clearly you need to introduce yourself. They need to know you are a person of authority and this is your role. In addition to the content the to and cc is equally important. Make sure is it directed to the appropriate parties at the supplier (not just support). Find out who the sales rep is and CC them - they need to understand this is potential sales problem down the line (or already). CC your manager and any other appropriate parties on your side. 

It is in your best interest to have this cleared up. Don't volunteer a preference. If asked just say "I can work in either department (say department not manager to not make it as personal). I would like to have clear direction." 

Just tell A "you have been selected". Just tell B "you have not been selected". If B asks why then "I felt A would be stronger for this task". If B feels they are as good then no good could come from debating it with them.
