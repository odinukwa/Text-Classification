It would be probably safest and most effective if you could demonstrate that this truly horrible email signature they think highlights how impressive they are actually makes them look completely unprofessional and amateurish. Bonus points if you can tie it back to the one thing that really matters to a corporation (money) and come to the table with something better. I can't imagine it would be difficult for you to get feedback from your friends and colleagues on the topic, nor would it be overly difficult to redesign it so that the worst parts (the very over-sized Microsoft App partner image and the 2015 partner of the year finalist image) are eliminated/changes into simple urls, or sized and placed more appropriately, instead of in the style of a tween who just figured out how to make a MySpace page back in 2003. "Look, I'm getting a lot of negative feedback about our email signature from potential clients/customers, and I think it's costing us money... for example, [provide some documented examples]." To help get you started, some feedback from a few IT professionals on your company's signature: 

No Sharing the "answer" to a company's programming test isn't very considerate. They're probably still using it. It you wanted to come work with me you'd have to write a program to solve a certain problem. I would then be irritated if you shared the problem and your solutions in a Googleable place, because it dilutes the value of that test from 'can code' to 'can Google'. You can ask and you probably would get away with posting it without asking. But is it that hard to write something of your own you can be proud of? 

So, really the problem is loud behavior from a senior colleague. If you have a look through most of the question on this site that ask "how do I complain about this behaviour", the key missing competent is usually "have you talked to the person you're complaining about"? So talk to them. State that you found they were being too loud and you couldn't get on with your work. Perhaps ask that they book a conference room next time. Perhaps you've tried talking to them and it didn't work. Perhaps this a serious problem and you don't feel able to resolve it on your own. Talk to your team leader. Someone was being to disruptive for you to work, this is your team leader's problem. Incidentally, don't jump above your team lead. It won't be appreciated by anyone and it misses the possibility that your team leader is probably the best person to have that informal conversation with the director of IT. Even if this is a matter for formal bureaucracy and complex hierarchy navigation, your team leader is better placed to manage that for you. I'm not really in a position to judge, so this comment may be nonsense. But there is the possibility that to fit in your workplace's culture you need to be capable of chilling out a bit on the afternoon before a bank holiday weekend. 

If you decide to get involved anyway, a subordinate approaching a superior is a likely fruitless approach anyway, so don't take that approach. A better approach would be to be approach one her peers, or friends, or superiors who is thinking straight and appraise them of the situation. These people are much more likely to be able to influence the drunk in question, so pass the task off. Much more likely to have the desired effect, less risky, and possibly even something that will be appreciated and/or remembered in the morning. 

The blunt and direct approach is the one I favor, and it works wonders for me. "Uh... I'd really prefer to talk about this when I don't have a hand on my penis, if you don't mind." Usually it gets a chuckle, occasionally it gets an ~"oh, of course," but it always ends the conversation, and no one's had a problem with it so far. 

Confirm your verbal resignation in writing now. If your employer disputes the validity or existence you don't really have much of a leg to stand on, but they might not bother. This problem gets harder every day you leave it. You and your employer can always mutually retract it. 

Yes. Linkin is the Facebook of shameless self promotion. Write a post that links to the news story. Add self-promotional text to that post. 

I'm making assumptions. If the agency is UK based and actually employing you, that's different, and it's your business to take it or not as long as it's at or above Â£6.70 an hour. I also don't know how upwork works, but I imagine (for the users who lack their own limited company) you're self-employed it's additional income you declare. Or maybe in practice people don't declare it, but HMRC will notice if this becomes your full time gig. 

This type of recommendation would probably be better termed as an introduction. It will get your resume, and possibly you, as a candidate, in front of a hiring manager, but that's all. In some cases, that's actually pretty valuable, in some cases, it's pretty meaningless. Once you or your resume are actually in front of the hiring manager, this kind of recommendation won't do much, if it does anything at all. You should consider that as well - job interviews ought to be a two-way thing. The employer is determining whether or not to make you a job offer, but you should also be evaluating the employer to determine whether you want to work for them or not. This is not just introducing you to a potential employer, it's also introducing a potential employer to you. As to feeling uneasy about this, don't. Knowing a guy who knows a guy is the way the vast majority of hiring (and for that matter, the world in general) actually works. When done well, hiring someone for a job is a mutually beneficial arrangement, so in providing this introduction/recommendation, the people in your network are helping you out, but are also helping out the person they're introducing/recommending you to as well. Once you get more job experience in your career field and develop a larger professional circle, you'll be a part of that too. You'll know both people who are looking for jobs, and people who are looking to hire ... why wouldn't you want to help both out by arranging an introduction? 

Proceed as usual. Giving early notice is a bad idea for a host of reasons already covered on this site. In your particular case: it's unclear whether your offer is solid offer yet. What would do if it fell through and you had to remain at the place you've essentially already resigned from? No. Terrible idea. Your notice should be enough to handle any subsequent handover, that's what it's for. Perhaps you could encourage your colleague to document things (or document things yourself) rather than just teach you, to make it easier for the next guy to pick up. 

It's not a completely horrible question. I can imagine it drawing out the candidate's beliefs about process improvement, prioritization, deadlines etc. I would use it as an opportunity about how I think work should be prioritized (Asking the hypothetical boss whether they communicated that this was the most important thing to them). Also, I'd talk about my beliefs about continuous improvement (Adding this situation to my hypothetical retrospective board so we could make sure it doesn't happen again). I'd also use this as opportunity to discover what they would do about an unreachable deadline. The thing is, these are my talking points, rather than a direct answer to the question. They're personal to me. Rather than just providing a witty answer, I've moved the conversation to the things I want to discuss. The things that advertise me, and things I want to discover about my prospective employer. You've asked this questions because you see interviews as a series of questions you have to pass. They're not, or at least they shouldn't be. In the end, they'll hire the person who communicates that they're the best candidate, not the person with the snappiest answers. Write down the things you'd like to communicate in your next interview. Then look up some common interview question and practice "hijaking" the conversation. 

Since no one's come out and said it plainly (yet), I'm going to come out and say that this is a request you would be well-advised not to make. Put yourself in your manager's chair, and imagine an employee coming to you with this request. When I do it, the first thought that pops into my mind is wondering what the [expletive] is wrong with the person who wants to come to someone else's workplace and sit quietly. This is followed very quickly by wondering what the [expletive] is wrong with the employee making the request (because there's gotta be something wrong with someone who's with someone like that, right?), and all kinds of scenarios to try to explain or make sense of this extremely odd request come tumbling through my mind, the first one being that this could be a symptom of an extremely abusive and controlling relationship... and I wonder if maybe I ought to put in an anonymous call to the police or a battered women's hotline. Granted, I am a bit paranoid and cynical, so maybe if you approach your boss, his first thought won't be that you're a wife-beater, but I don't see any way around him thinking you very odd for asking. And then what happens if he agrees to your request and all your coworkers see your fiancee coming in on a regular basis, and sitting quietly in corner? Sounds like a spectacular way to fast-track yourself into the position of the office weirdo and invite all kinds of gossip and the like about you and your fiancee. And of course, were he to grant your request, what about your co-workers? I'd love to have someone I'm having sex with "sit quietly" in my office with me while I work. Wink, wink, nudge, nudge. "I swear, she won't make a sound, and I'll be a much happier employee as a result. No? Well, then why is one of my coworkers getting special treatment and being allowed to hang out with his girlfriend when he's supposed to be working?" There's just no good way for this to turn out if you make the request, so don't make it. The better approach would probably be for her to find a hobby, learn a new skill or visit public places, like normal people do when they don't want to sit home alone and be bored or lonely. Libraries, museums, parks, pubs/coffee shops, visiting the local tourist attractions, even something like MeetUp or volunteer work would be normal, healthy reactions to not wanting to be home alone, as opposed to this idea, which at best will only result in people thinking you two are weird, at best. 

Are you contracting or are they employing you? Have they sorted out pensions, benefits, national insurance, employers' liability insurance etc in employ you? Since this arrangement is in $s, I doubt it. They probably expect you to be a contractor or self employed. This is complex and it seems like you don't have a great understanding level of this currently. You should expect to be getting "paid" much more because you have your own employer side tax to pay and benefits to purchase. This is not where the complexities of working for yourself end, but it's genuinely not worth getting into unless they're paying you more in the range of double what you'd like for a normal job. Just forget it and move on. I know it sucks, but keep looking for a normal job. 

If they won't tell you who they are, or leave a message, it means they're making a sales call. That's why they won't tell you; they know you won't put them through if they do. You're acting as a call-screener for your boss, so this is expected behavior to a large degree. (Wasting your time, rather than your boss's time.) So, the short answer to your question is that when they won't tell who they are or why they're calling, that tells you what the call is about - a sales call that you're supposed to be preventing your boss from getting. (Wasting a technical resource for this purpose strikes me as gross mismanagement of resources, and not good for your personal career development either, but that's a separate issue.) You can't really prevent this kind of caller from calling, or calling back, unfortunately. (If you could, everyone would do it, and telemarketing calls wouldn't be a thing.) The best you'll be able to do is dissuade some of them from calling back by making it clear that your manager is screening sales calls and will never be available to take their call. When they dodge your question about who they are by ask when the manager will be available, respond by telling them that the manager does not accept sales calls or unscheduled calls from unidentified parties. 

Calm down. There's no need to bomb the recruitment agency. You encountered a bad recruiter, just don't field their calls. Having said that, as a recent graduate your CV probably does suck and you would do well to respond to critics in an adult manner (not like this). Incidently, the reason they want .doc CVs is so they can edit it. I would stick with pdfs. 

1 phone interview, 1 face to face interview. Hiring the right person is a thing you don't want to mess up, for obvious reasons. So it can be tempting to think that the thing you need is more time. "you'd probably already know whether you want to hire the candidate after the first interview, but a second one can be nice" - I will stop you there. You're right, after reading a cv, doing a phone interview you probably will end up knowing in the first five minutes of the interview. More time would be "nice", meaning it has low marginal value. Your time is valuable. You should have someone from the team interviewing. This person has actual work to do, and it's unhelpful for them to stretch out the time they have to spend away from it. Incidentally, if you don't have this problem because no one from the team is at the interview (just HR say), cancel that interview, you are wasting everyone's time. The candidates' time is valuable. To hire good people you must respect their time. People have to take time off work to do interviews. Unless you want to actively filter out competent professionals with a host of opportunities to choose from (presumably in favor of the desperate and inferior) you cannot ask them to take multiple days. This means no "evaluation days", you are not Google (I mean, unless you are google). This means no "nice" (aka low margin value) second interviews. Moral of the story: Get good at interviewing so you can distil that first interview into something really useful. Respect both your employees' and your future employees' time. Also, as a general point, you don't need to actively try to catch up with the bureaucratic inefficiencies of large corporations. 

Alcohol makes people act erratically and distorts perceptions and memories, which adds risk, especially for men. 

That last one is probably the best approach for all involved, so that's what I'd advise you do - dial back on the extra work so that management starts to feel the consequences of being understaffed and has time to make the needed adjustments, because the other options create a much more rapid change in your department's ability to do work, and that tends to go badly for everyone involved - management and the employees. 

Without knowing more specifics about your situation, any declaration about what you should do is going to be guesswork, at best, but those are basically your options. Personally, I'm strongly inclined to option 5, if for no other reason than the fact that every other option requires additional work, exposes you to additional risk, and comes with basically no reward - you resolve the behavior one way or the other, and... get to go back to doing your job without having someone stab you in the back while you're doing it. But maybe your situation is different, and you're (for example) vastly overpaid, so the job is worth fighting for, or hard-pressed to get another job, or whatever.
