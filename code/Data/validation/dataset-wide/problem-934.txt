It is fine-grained variety of calcite either Travertine or Tufa. Travertine is a form of limestone deposited by mineral springs, especially hot springs. Travertine often has a fibrous or concentric appearance and exists in white, tan, cream-colored, and even rusty varieties. Tufa is a variety of limestone formed when carbonate minerals precipitate out of ambient temperature water. It goes by several common names: Tecalli, Mexican Onyx, and Mexican Marble. 

Here is a map of seismic hazards for the United States from the United States Geological Survey. Link. 

The divisions in the geologic time scale have evolved over time. Its origins can be traced back to Nicolaus Steno in 1669 described two basic geologic principles. 

It looks like a piece of chert and maybe related to nearby limestone formation. What state/province and country did you find it in and where (in a stream, along a road or railroad, or hiking trailing? 

Your stone is most likely glass or quartz based on the scratch test. Coloration is odd which is also why I say glass or quartz. Your stone could also be glass. Take it to a jeweler who can measure the refractive Index (RI). RI value will tell you conclusively what it is and you won't damage your stone. Pale colored topaz, beryl and corundum (sapphire) typically are uniform in color so your stone does not match. I've seen similar color pattern in fluorite but it would have been scratched by the pumice. 

Your rock looks like quartzite, metamorphic rock derived from a rock that was previously a sedimentary sandstone with gravel to cobble size pieces of quartz. There is quite abit of metamorphic rocks around Easton, PA. Reference: Geology map of Easton, PA. 

Upper Mississippi river near St Paul Minnesota is closed December - March. US Army Corp of Engineers is responsible river navigation in the United States. From winonapost.com, (from 2015) the article states that all vessels need to be south of Lock and Dam 9, near Lynxville, Wisconsin. Sounds like the upper river is closed so locks can be dewatered and maintanence performed. My guess is most of the Mississippi river remains open to navigation south of Wisconsin during the winter.

To get maximum value, you need to clean the specimens, and if you have the tools and patience, carefully trim the specimens as needed. I use eBay as a loose guide for going prices on mineral specimens. Double terminated 

Metal oxide minerals like tantalite (tantalum) and columbite (niobium) often form placer deposits within basins and drainages. The placer deposits are a secondary ore deposits created by the weathering of tantalite/columbite bearing granite and the transport of heavy sands by water and gravity. Based on this information, a good approach to prospecting for tantalum / niobium would be collect dark/black sand samples from stream beds within a granite mountain range and to collect samples from riverbeds flowing out of mountain ranges with exposed granite. Larger rivers with steep terrain can carry heavy sediment further away from its source area. Example: Sawtooth Mountains in Central Idaho are a large granite batholith complex.. Salmon river and its tributaries would excellent areas to look for placer deposits (except of course most of this area is designated as National Forest land.) 

I'm pretty sure a more rigorous answer deserves to come along, but I can give a simple overview of some of the important factors. Cleavage planes have to do with bond strength and bond geometry. If there isn't a plane of bonds that can be cut through, then you won't get cleavage. When a mineral is fractured, the fracture "wants" to take the path where the total energy required to break all of the bonds along that path is at a minimum. In Halite, you can "cleave" a perfect plane through weaker ionic bonds (the geometry works, and the bonds are weak). In quartz, all of the bonds are of the same strength (strong silicate bonds), and the geometry of the mineral is such that you can not find a plane that will cut through all of the bonds, therefore the fractures must "wander" creating the conchoidal structures. In mica, the cleavage planes form between the silicate sheets. The silica bonds are strong, the the sheets are held together by weaker ionic bonds. 

When reading older papers how should I interpret the use of "Late Tertiary" and "Early Tertiary"? Would these periods equate to Paleogene and Neogene, or was there a different accepted boundary age between the Late and Early Tertiary? 

I am going to assume that you are referring to recent new stories with titles like "Rare Diamond Confirms That Earth's Mantle Holds an Ocean's Worth of Water" (Scientific America). These articles are referring to research published in Nature: Pearson, D. G. et al. (2014). The researchers found an inclusion of ringwoodite inside a diamond. Here is a quote from the Nature article about the paper... 

This doesn't mean that there is a liquid ocean of water within the transition zone. There are minerals that are considered "hydrated" because they contain hydroxide ions. Examples of these are the serpentine group and micas. Ringwoodite can contain hydroxide ions within its structure, and these ions are the "water" that was measured. If you were to lower the pressure, and increase the temperature, the water would be liberated from the mineral. The point is that there are not huge oceans of liquid water within the mantle of the Earth; the water is locked up in the structure of certain minerals. There are interesting implications from this research discussed in the Nature News article about the research. Nature News Article 

When learning to distinguish between siliceous and calcareous samples you should use a handlens. Look for quartz, feldspars or micas. Quartz clasts may be frosted, or you may be able to see conchoidal fracture. Calcite will be very soft compared to both feldspar and quartz, and should fail to scratch copper (or at least not scratch it very well, while a quartz rich sedimentary hand sample will scratch glass. For really fine grained stuff, there are times when you may need to use the context of site where the sample is from if you don't have HCL. There can be sedimentary rocks that are made up of siliceous clasts that react with HCL due to calcite in the matrix, so HCL can be misleading. I've even found that some mudstones and limestones can have an organic odor. Lastly, there are structures that can suggest if a sample is siliceous or calcareous. Styolites would suggest non-siliceous while thermal alterations like liesegang banding would suggest siliceous. The more samples you tackle, the easier it gets. 

Your pebbles are most likely are quartzite. Quartzite (from German: Quarzit) is a hard, non-foliated metamorphic rock which was originally pure quartz sandstone. Sandstone is converted into quartzite through heating and pressure usually related to tectonic compression within orogenic belts. 

It is agate. By its appearance, shape and color, the agate matches common agate found in Brazil. This is a common color for agate so the piece might be from another location. Cut and polished Brazilian agate is commonly sold around the globe. 

Your rock most likely contains common opal or chalcedony (cryptocrystalline variety of quartz). You will be able to scratch opal with a sturdy steel knife blade but not chalcedony. 

You have three pieces of cryptocrystalline quartz commonly called chalcedony or agate. The lower left piece appears to have druzy quartz crystals. 

Himalayas represent a huge area with a complex geological history which I suspect has large areas that have never been adequately mapped to allow for an ore deposit evaluation. Nevertheless, placer gold might be found within any region of the Himalayas. Placer gold deposits are an accumulation of gold formed by gravity separation during sedimentary processes of the gold bearing host rock. Reference: $URL$ Many granite bearing mountains containing quartz-feldspar porphyry dykes/veins associated with elevated concentrations of sulfur and arsenic can be found in many parts of the world. I would assume these deposits would also found in the Himalayas. Reference: $URL$ 

Your specimen is smoky quartz (black) and orthoclase or microcline feldspar. The combination of smoky quartz and feldspar is a common granitic mineral assemblage seen around the world. Your specimen looks very similar to quartz and microcline specimens from the Rocky Mountains in Colorado. Two specimens from my personal collection from central Colorado. 

Base rock is most likely quartz or feldspar. My best guess is that your specimen is a pseudomorph. I think it might be quartz or feldspar psuedomorph after amphibole or pyroxene. As for location, you would need to find a matching specimen online or in a museum. In mineralogy, a pseudomorph is a mineral or mineral compound that appears in an atypical form (crystal system), resulting from a substitution process in which the appearance and dimensions remain constant, but the original mineral is replaced by another. The name literally means "false form". Here is Talc after quartz from Germany. www.irocks.com 

Your rock is mostly anthracite coal. You best diagnostic test is density. Coal even anthracite is generally the least dense rock that has no visible porosity. As for the colors, coal typically shows a large range of surface sheen colors but due a number of impurities like complex organic compounds and metal sulfides. 

Some chemical reactions are very improbable due to elements involved with in a specific environment. Consider: Cubic zirconia (CZ) is the cubic crystalline form of zirconium dioxide (ZrO2). It is not found in nature because there are no stable environments for formation where Silicon is absent. Zircons are formed instead. (zirconium silicate (ZrSiO4). 

Minerals that commonly form in the mantle of the earth are naturally going to hard to find at the surface regardless of the chemical position. Volcanic mineral assemblies require a volcanic activity which is typically limited to plate boundaries and isolated mantle hot spots.
