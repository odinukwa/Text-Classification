What I did is Leaks inverse demand function $p=a-bq$ And $q=q_1+q_2$ And since marginal cost is constant c, then cost function is $cq_i$ First of all, I find Cournot equilibrium outputs $q_c$ I obtain by the profit maximization problem $$q_c=\frac{a-c}{3b}$$ for both firms. Secondly, since firm 2 also has a choice $q_2^* >> q_c$ Then let’s assume that $q_2^* = \frac{a-c}{2b}>>\frac{a-c}{3b}=q_c$ Then in order to obtain Stackelberg setup, by backward induction method Let’s calculate $q^*_1$ which is the firm 1’s quantity when firm 2 chooses $q_2^*=\frac{a-c}{2b}$. $$\pi_1=(a-bq_1-b(\frac{a-c}{2b}))q_1-cq_1$$ By FOC, $$q_1^*=\frac{a-c}{4b}$$ And $$q^*_1<< q_c$$ Thirdly I calculated profits for four cases Case 1: firm1’s quantity and firm 2’s quantity are both $q_c$ Then both firms’ profits are equal and equal to $\frac{(a-c)^2}{9b}$ Case 2: firm1’s quantity is $q_1^*$ firm 2’s quantity is $q_c$ Then, Firm 1’s profit =$\frac{5(a-c)^2}{48b}$ Firm 2’s profit =$\frac{5(a-c)^2}{36b}$ Case 3: firm1’s quantity is $q_c$ firm 2’s quantity is $q_2^*$ Then, Firm 1’s profit =$\frac{(a-c)^2}{18b}$ Firm 2’s profit =$\frac{5(a-c)^2}{12b}$ Case 4: firm1’s quantity is $q_1^*$ firm 2’s quantity is $q_2^*$ Then, Firm 1’s profit =$\frac{(a-c)^2}{16b}$ Firm 2’s profit =$\frac{(a-c)^2}{8b}$ Now let’s look at the part (A) I construct the following table Table So as it is seen, only $(q_c, q_c)$ is Nash equilibrium. But $(q_1^*, q_2^*)$ is not Nash equilibrium. Next let’s look at the part (B) I construct tree in this case. Tree When we look at the table, First of all, it is for firm 2, In the left hand side, since the payoff of $q_c$ is greater than the payoff of $q_2^*$, the firm 2 will choose $q-c$. In the right hand side, since the payoff of $q_2^*$ is greater the payoff of $q_c$ for firm 2, then the firm 2 will choose $q^*_2$. Now, as for firm 1, if firm 1 choose $q_c$ then it knows that its payoff will be $(a-c)^2/9b$. But if firm 1 choose $q^*_1$ the its payoff will be $(a-c)^2/16b$. So the firm 1 will decide to choose $q_c$. That’s SPNE is $(q_c,q_cq_c)$. That is, $(q_1^*,q_2^*)$ is not SPNE. 

How do we resolve the equity-premium puzzle? When should a government subsidize trade to resolve the Myerson-Satterthwaite bilateral trade problem? Is there really a feasible Walrasian auctioneer for [insert market here]? 

Famous labor economist James Heckman made the argument that given money for investing into educating people, we should invest into young children, and pretty much only that age group, because they have the most periods of time to compound human capital over time, and arguably get the most benefit from it. $URL$ Obviously it's a pretty strong argument, and I was wondering what sort of research in the literature you might find important that takes the stance against this sort of idea. My intuition tells me that we'd want to smooth investment into all sorts of age groups of people for some sort of externality reason. 

Forgive me in advance if this is already familiar. I'll be talking about stability of equilibrium the way I (briefly) learned it. Let $\xi^j(p)$ denote the excess demand for good $j$ given price $p$. $$\xi^j(p) = \sum^m_{h=1}\left( x^j_h(p) - e^j_h \right) = x^j(p) - r^j$$ For $m$ households/consumers, $e$ being an endowment to a household, and $r^j$ being the total resource available of good $j$. We say the rate of price adjustment over time $\left(\frac{\partial p^j}{\partial t}\right)$ is proportional to excess demand. For either of your market clearing prices $p^*$, we then know that $x^j(p^*) = r^j \ \forall j \implies \xi^j(p) = 0$ Otherwise, $\xi^j(p)> 0 \implies \text{excess demand} \implies \frac{\partial p^j}{\partial t} > 0$ $\xi^j(p)< 0 \implies \text{excess supply} \implies \frac{\partial p^j}{\partial t} < 0$ Out of the three equilibrium you have up there, we'd probably want to find one that was locally stable and say that's where the market is more likely to realistically go. Steady state $p^*$ is locally stable if $\exists \epsilon > 0 \ \text{s.t.} \ \forall \ p(0) \in B_\epsilon (p^*)$, an open neighborhood with radius $\epsilon$ around $p^*$, then we have $p(t, p(0)) \rightarrow p^*$ I don't want to fuddle this too much with math (particularly when you linearize the system and have to deal with eigenvalues/eigenvectors), so let's just take a look at your supply and demand curves above. We can peruse the math on our own time. Case A: Let's say you are at point A, your nice equilibrium. Suddenly there is a downwards quantity shock and you are now to the left of $q_A$. Since there is excess demand, the change in price over time should be positive, so the price will rise, and you will arrive back at point A. What if you are shocked to the right of $q_A$ in the short run? Now there is excess supply and price over time should fall. If you were still above $p^*_A$ at this point, you will arrive back at point A. Otherwise price will fall all the way until you reach point B. Case B: We know what happens with a shock to the left of point B now. What about to the right? If point C looks like a global minimum of the supply curve from what it looks like, then any shock that gets you before point C gets you excess demand, which means the price will rise and you will arrive back at point B. Case C: To the right of point C, there is excess supply, and prices will fall back down until you reach C again. None of these equilibria seem globally stable. It seems C is not locally stable on the left, so I wouldn't say the market would hang out there for very long. Points A and B are locally stable, but it seems B has greater room to get shocked and still move back towards B. So for this scenario, I personally like B as your long run equilibrium. If you had extra information about how shocks in the market happen (how often, variance, etc.), it may allow you to describe what percentage of the time you stick around at each equilibria, and you could describe an aggregate equilibrium like that as well. 

We have two firms with identical cost structure compete in a market Demand function = $p=a-bq$ And $q=q_1+q_2$ They are identical in every way. However, firm 1 maximizes profit and firm 2 maximizes revenue as long as shareholders are satisfied, which he achieves by keeping profits nonnegative. Both firms have constant and equal marginal cost c. So I want to find the quantities that they will choose. ——— What I did is... For firm 1, $$\pi_1=max[(a-b(q_1+q_2))q_1-cq_1]$$ FOCs for $q_1$ $$a-2bq_1-bq_2-c=0$$ So $$q_1={a-bq_2-c\over 2b}$$ For firm 2, $$max [(a-b(q_1+q_2))q_2]$$ FOCs $$a-bq_1-2bq_2=0$$ $$q_2={a-bq_1\over 2b}$$ So, $$q_1={a-b({a-bq_1\over 2b})-c\over 2b}$$ $$q_1^*={a-2c\over 3b}$$ And $$q^*_2={5a+2b\over 6b}$$ —- The question says that “* firm 1 maximizes profit and firm 2 maximizes revenue as long as shareholders are satisfied, which he achieves by keeping profits nonnegative.*” Because of this sentence, I am exactly not sure about my solution. Especially for firm 2. I’m confused at this point. Please tell my mistakes. Thank you. 

Case 2: $p \cdot x \geq p \cdot y$ and $y \succ x \ \forall p$ Similarly, pick the same $p$. $$p \cdot x \geq p \cdot y \implies \sum^s_{i=1} x_i \geq \sum^s_{i=1} y_i$$ $y \succ x \iff y > x$ by monotonicity but then $\sum^s_{i=1} x_i < \sum^s_{i=1} y_i$ which is a contradiction. 

Two kids at school are arguing over who owns a cool video game cartridge, and the schoolteacher, a ruthlessly practical social planner who knows that kids can only enforce so much AND that the game is worthless to either kid except in its full cartridge, does not believe in sharing; she demands that the one of them buy the other's share of the game off of the other. She tells each kid that they will privately submit two values to her, $b_1$ and $s_1$ for the first kid and $b_2$ and $s_2$ for the second. Here $b_i$ is (supposed to be) the maximum willingness to pay for the other agent's share of the game, and $s_i$ denotes the minimum price each agent would be willing to sell their share of the game for. She starts to propose a mechanism: 

I have multiple question. (1) when John doesn’t work in the underground economy at all , t=0, how can I find the optimal value of $l$ and consumption bundle and his utility. (2) And when john work in the underground economy, t>0, how can write his optimization problem? Can I say that $l=0$ for t>0 by using the equation (1) in the picture? And in this case, when he is not fined, which way I can find his optimal consumption bundle and his expected utility? (3) finally, I would like to derive an inequality in order to describe for which parameter values John elects to work in the underground economy. And how can I decide whether John is willing to work in the underground economy or not if m and w increase by the same dollar amount ? Sorry for not posting my answer, because I am not familiar with such a question, my answer is really trivial. 

A rough guideline: You already know the first case. At $q < q_c$ (competitive quantity), we have $$S(p) > S(p_c) = D(p_c) > D(p)$$ This is assuming you have "normal" (monotonic) assumptions on the supply and demand curves, which are pretty important to this proof. Notice that $S(p) = q_s; D(p) = q_d$ and in this case $q = q_s < q_d$, that is, there is a shortage. At any higher price $p_0 \in (p, p_c]$, there is a Pareto improvement. A new seller will sell at this higher price and there will exist some buyer willing to still buy it. The other case is analogous. At $q > q_c$, now $$D(p) > D(p_c) = S(p_c) > S(p)$$ You can use a similar argument as Varian's. At any lower price, there will be a buyer willing to buy the good and a seller still willing to supply the good. 

So this may be a good place for you to start. For an article that is a little more recent/available online, you could look at extensions of the original work in this area, such as bundle pricing for homogeneous items (Grigoriev et.al., no date), or this article correlated valuations for the items (Chen and Ni, 2017). 

There are two firs in the market. They produce perfect substitutes at cost $c(y_i)=y_i/3$ for i=1,2. The demand function is $p=1-(y_1+y_2)$ Consider the Cournot competition where firms simultaneously produce their respective outputs. However firm 1 has the opportunity to announce the output it will produce to firm 2 before the firms have produced any output. How can I find the equilibrium quantities? ———————— What I have done... For basic case, Cournot equilibrium For firm 1, $$max[(1-y_1-y_2)y_1-(y_1/3)]$$ FOCs $$1-2y_1-y_2-(1/3)=0$$ $$y_1={2-3y_2\over 6}$$ For firm 2, $$max[(1-y_1-y_2)y_2-(y_2/3)]$$ FOCs $$1-2y_2-y_1-(1/3)=0$$ $$y_2={2-3y_1\over 6}$$ So, $$y_1=(1/3)-(1/2)(2-3y_1/6)$$ $$y^*_1=2/9$$ $$y_2^*=2/9$$ For Stackelberg eqn in basic cases First firm is mover first $$max[(1-y_1-y_2)y_2-(y_2/3)]$$ FOCs $$1-2y_2-y_1-(1/3)=0$$ $$y_2={2-3y_1\over 6}$$ For firm 1, $$max[(1-y_1-y_2)y_1-(y_1/3)]$$ $$max[(1-y_1-({2-3y_1\over 6}))y_1-(y_1/3)]$$ FOCs $$1-2y_1-(1/3)y_1-y_1-(1/3)=0$$ $$y_1^*=1/5$$ $$y_2^*=7/30$$ I just find only Stackelberg equilibrium and Cournot equilibrium in basic cases. But I cannot find the part that I write above. How can I solve this part? Thank you. 

Consider an oligopoly between two identical firms producing a homogenous good with constant marginal cost where firms face linear market demand. $B_i(q_j)$ denotes firm i’s best response given the output by firm j for i,j=1,2 and $i\not= j$. Let $q_c$ denote the Cournot equilibrium output choice where firms choose output simultaneously. Assume now a Stackelberg setup, where firm 2 observes firm 1’s choice before making its own output choice. Consider the following pair of strategies in the Stackelberg setup: firm 1 chooses $q_c$. Firm 2 chooses $q_c$ if firm 1 chooses $q_c$ otherwise firm 2 chooses $q^*_2 >>q_c$. (A) show whether or not the pair of strategies described above constitutes a Nash equilibrium in the game. (B) show whether or not the pair of strategies described above constitutes a subgame perfect equilibrium in the game. 

Note that $$+ e\frac{\lambda - \theta}{[-1-\lambda]}$$ actually simplifies to $$ - e\frac{\lambda - \theta}{[1 + \lambda]} $$ rather than with $\lambda + \theta$ in the numerator like you had. So the solutions has $$- e \frac{1 + \theta}{1 + \lambda}$$ instead of what we have above. The difference between the two is: $$-e\frac{-1 - \lambda}{1 + \lambda} = e$$ 

You can do a similar thought experiment for bidding lower. If you bid lower and win, then what you pay doesn't change from bidding the proposed strategy. If you lose when you would've lost anyway, then nothing changes. If you lose when originally you would've won, then you're taking a relative loss again. So there is no outcome that makes you better off by unilaterally deviating from the proposed strategy of bidding $b_1^*$. You can extend this to realize it is a dominant strategy for all players to follow this line of reasoning. What about with three players with two winners? Three players with one winner? This question is really just a weird extension of a second price auction. If you understand that, that will help, but otherwise, try following the intuition above and re-reading your solutions given to you. 

I have also following budget set $$B=\{x=(x_1,x_2)\in R^2_+ \mid 2\sqrt{x_1}+x_2\le y\}$$ where y is income. Assume that there are two stories. The agent can shop in both of them. The first store has a quantity discount on good1 as described above. And a fixed unit price of good 2. $p_2=1$. The other store charges fixed unit prices, $p_1=2$ and $p_2=1/2$ respectively. Assume that income y is 6. How can I write the feasible budget constraint for utility maximization $U(x_1, x_2)=x_1x_2$. And since there is two stores, how can I write Lagrangian function for calculation of the optimization problem. I know I have to write my trials. But I cannot write properly any budget constraint and Lagrangian therefore, I cannot post my solution. Any help is appreciated. Thank you. Edit 

I solve this question in this way. But I am exactly not sure about my way. Please share your ideas with me. I will be happy if say something abou my solution. Thank you. 

Usually in cost minimization problems where the production function is a constraint, there is a set quantity to be produced that then leads to minimizing cost with respect to that. Here in this profit maximization problem, you have a minimum amount of production required of both goods, which I find interesting. We can note the objective function (profit) is linear, and therefore concave and differentiable. The constraints are more interesting because the Cobb-Douglas form is not necessarily concave, namely when the exponents sum to more than 1. So you can ask yourself when the constraints will be convex (they are certainly differentiable). These ideas are related to the sufficient conditions for an optimum. A solution exists by the Weierstrass Theorem (constraint is compact and the objective function is continuous). To look at the first order necessary conditions, we can omit your last two equalities since they don't add anything. We take: \begin{equation} \begin{array}{l} \max_{q_{x}, q_{y}, l_{x}, l_{y}, k_{x}, l_{x}} \quad p_{x}q_{x}+p_{y}q_{y}-w(l_{x}+l_{y})-v(k_{x}+k_{y}) \\ \text{s.t.} \\ q_{x} - k_{x}^{\alpha}l_{x}^{\beta} \leq 0 \\ q_{y} - k_{y}^{\gamma}l_{y}^{\delta} \leq 0 \\ \end{array} \end{equation} Form the Lagrangean: $$\max \quad \mathscr{L} = p_{x}q_{x}+p_{y}q_{y}-w(l_{x}+l_{y})-v(k_{x}+k_{y}) - \mu_x (q_{x} - k_{x}^{\alpha}l_{x}^{\beta}) - \mu_y (q_{y} - k_{y}^{\gamma}l_{y}^{\delta})$$ (note the signs in front of the Lagrangean multipliers) Then, in place of the derivative with respect to the multipliers, we have our constraints with complementary slackness conditions. We take the other constraints as well. $$\frac{\partial \mathscr{L}}{\partial \ ( \cdot )} \leq 0 \quad ; \quad ( \cdot ) \geq 0 \quad \forall ( \cdot )$$ $$\text{constraint} \quad ; \quad \mu_{(\cdot)} \geq 0$$ And from there you can move on to solve the system, but you may find yourself in a weird spot because we haven't been able to establish uniqueness. 

Two firms are in a market together. They produce a product. Total revenue from sales is $y=K+L$ K is the amount of capital L is the amount of labor These two firms each specialized in supplying one of inputs and the cost of the input supplied is incurred by the person providing it. For capital, the cost is $K^2/2$ and for labor, the cost is $L^2/2$ And they share revenue from their business equally. I need to find firstly that if eac is interested in maximizing his own profit, then how much of each input will they use, and how much profit will each make. And secondly, I need to find the profit maximizing level of inputs for whole business. As a result, I need to compare what I have found in both parts. ———- my solution For firm 1, $$max [1/2(K+L)-K^2/2]$$ FOCs: $1/2-K=0$ So $K=1/2$. He use 1/2 unit of capital. And his profit is $\pi= 1/2*(1/2+L)-1/4=1/2*L\ge 0$ for $L>0$ Similarly, For firm 2, $$max [1/2(K+L)-L^2/2]$$ FOCs: $1/2-L=0$ So $L=1/2$. He use 1/2 unit of labor. And his profit is $\pi= 1/2*(1/2+K)-1/4\ge 0$ for $L\ge 0$ ======= And I have tried to find the profit maximization for entire business $$max[(K+L)- K^2/2-L^2/2]$$ FOCs; $1-K=0$ so K=1 and $1-L=0$ so L=1 And profit $= (1+1)-(1/2+1/2)=1>0$ Now, all parts of my solution are correct?
