"Free will by a newbie" I think that our actions are determined by our genetics and environment and I don't believe in a "separate mind or soul" making choices. I believe it is all contained in our brain and our mind is one and the same as our brain. However, lets consider a possibility that our complex brain has evolved higher order functions that include a "choice engine". The engine has evolved as it can give people a survival edge to act differently given the same environment. The engine is a set of complex interacting and self modifying algorithms obeying all the law of nature. The unique thing about the engine is that given any set of inputs it does not give the same answer every time and nor does it give a random answer. It's rules allow it to make a considered choice. At this point, I don't think we can construct such a machine, but that doesn't preclude its existence in our brains. Humans need to "invent" a "choice engine" in a super computer and demonstrate that it's choices are neither random nor pre-determined. In fact they will have to have two of them side by side and show that they produce differing results with the same input without randomness. The other point worth mentioning is that if there is no free will and all is determined, we are still unlikely to ever be able to make accurate predictions beyond statistical probabilities (i.e. certainties) that will be useful. So where does one go with determinism, if we'll never be smart enough to pre-determine anything that is even slightly complex - say what direction will a microbe travel in a solution in a petri dish. Obviously, that doesn't change how "true" determinism is, but it also makes it a rather useless truth. I listened to an excellent radio podcast last week between 3 neuroscientists (BBC In our Time - Neuroscience). They describe the brain in 3 sections, in increasing order of evolutionary development and from low to high function. The inner brain, nearest the spinal system, deals with motor functions and direct response to sensory input. This is the "reptilian" brain, dealing with simple stuff. It's the engine of a machine. No free will going on here, just survival impulse. The next layer is the "mammalian" brain that deals for more complex sensory input, interpretation, learning, emotions, etc. Sort of stuff that makes a chimpanzee so human in its behaviour. The last layer is the surface areas of the brain, uniquely human. Here is where the human high order functions happen. This is where "planning", sorting through large amounts of data and distilling this into strategies far more complex than "man kill, man make fire, man eat" - the most commonly given example is, what college shall I go to? It's not a low order impulse driven decision. It's a high order, complex decision, based on many variables, where the variables themselves are not senses and are not definitive. Indeed, the variables will change - you might change your opinion based on your mood on a particular day. Because of all of this complexity and variability, the decisions taken ("free will?") are not easily predicted not easily replicated. If they can't be predicted and replicated, then, even with deterministic physics at the ultimate root, this can be considered "free will" - at least its a candidate for free will. So my "newbie" definition of free will is "actions that cannot be predicted and are not random". I suspect this is full of holes and tautology, but I like it for now. 

The inscrutability of reference is the thesis that for any natural language L, there is no fact of the matter about what the referring expressions of L refer to, or about what the predicates of L have in their extension. One way Quine arrives at this conclusion is through the 'proxy function' argument and I find it very confusing. Here's how I understand it. Suppose we have a language L and that M is a manual that takes all the sentences in L and assigns things as referents to the terms occurring in L sentences. A proxy function is a 1-1 function that takes all the sentences interpreted by M and assigns new objects to the terms in those sentences. So if M assigns x to some term t, a proxy function will assign p(x) to t. The referents of singular terms in M are replaced with 'proxy referents', predicates refer to 'proxy properties' and relations are reinterpreted from 'xRy' to 'the proxy of x bears R to the proxy of y'. 

There are infinitely many ways to do such assignments, let's pick one interpretation and call it 'T'. So far this seems straightforward.* It is claimed that the new translations in T, can have different ontological commitments from the M translations. This is also straightforward, as I think the example above illustrates. Here's what I don't understand. 1-It's further claimed that (e.g. here and here) that the T & M sentences (in the example above and similar examples) have the same meaning and the same truth conditions. How? The circumstances that make the sentences true in the above example are not the same circumstances and the referents are not the same. Even if a sentence is made true by two models, it does not follow that the models are identical. Quine's notion of stimulus meaning, ''...just that set of total neural stimulations that prompt assent on the native’s part to the query ‘S?’ or that elicit an utterance of ‘S’ all by themselves.''(A.Ahmed, QL1), does not seem helpful here. A person may assent to one interpretation of the sentence in the above example but not the other. Hence they do not have the same meaning. 2-Even if this procedure shows that sentences with different referents have the same meaning and truth conditions, why does this prove that there are no facts about what words mean? Why can't you say that some community uses interpretation I for the sentences of their language and some other language community use I* for their language and there is some fact about whether the set of I & I* referents are the same set. Why does the proxy function argument establish the ontological indeterminacy of reference instead of just epistemic limits on our knowledge? *(This is a brief and intuitive explanation not a rigorous one. Still I hope it was 'clear enough'. If not, there are formal statements of all this in the literature). 

So are you saying that our math and geometry is universal?, that that is the only way to understand reality?? Are you saying that space is reduced to Einstein's formulas and all entities in the universe have to abide to them ? That there is no other way?? Theres no better way ?? Will there ever be a right way?? Are you saying that the human mind is the only "objective" witness to reality ?? How do you know that ?? Kant is not presenting idealism to replace your realism, he is just saying that you make no sense when you say: 

I believe that none of the answers understand Kant or Idealism in general. Please understand: Kant is NOT trying to disprove objective reality. A naive approach to idealism is to think that, and then to conclude that it tries to disprove all our dear science. For example when you say: 

So, look at your keyboard again. No, there’s no keyboard there. You are “looking” at a representation inside your head, like in a flat screen, where you only see the results of the analysis made by your mind. Please note that the question is not whether the keyboard exists or not, but what are you expecting as a keyboard outside your mind? 

First detach yourself emotionally from all your research and understanding, then see that Kant can not possible be trying to disprove that, because that assumes that Kant has a concept of "real existence". Kant is not assuming a well defined concept of objective reality, you are. If then you reply: " but his reasoning is not valid vs the reality of Science", then you still do not understand. Do not try to understand idealism / kant by comparing it to your realism. Open your mind: Start with OUT the concept of objective reality. I will make a futile experiment to try to explain what PLATO, DESCARTES or KANT said: Lets start with your concept of reality as it pertains to that keyboard under your hands. The problem you need to recognize is not in the keyboard, but in what you used to know it is there. Note that the keyboard didn’t pop in your mind as soon as it was built. It appeared in your mind after you saw it right ? a) THINGS are IDEAS The first problem with all these was noted by PLATO. He realized that things do not pop in our minds by themselves, they appear after a collection of perceptions: Rectangularness, number of keys, color, angles of the sides…. He called these: “IDEAS”. You agree that you cannot describe your keyboard with out using ideas right? b) IDEAS do not exist in the "real world" The problem with such “IDEAS” is that they don't exist. There aren't any perfect squares, circles, straight lines, or points in space in the experienced world. What do you mean with a points in empty space in the first place? What is a line between to points in space? A single point moving in space ?? See that those are not "real" things by themselves. c) IDEAS do not make things REAL For one thing, none of these “IDEAS” belong specifically to your keyboard, they are general. These “IDEAS” have no connection with the keyboard. You can think about the keyboard whether the keyboard still exists or not. IDEAS have nothing to do with it. Also they apply to other keyboards. I bet if I replace it behind your back with the same model, you will not notice that your "real" keyboard is not there. So if you use IDEAS to define your KEYBOARD, and IDEAS are not real, how come you say the KEYBOARD is real ?? d) IDEAS do not come from REALITY You will say: IDEAS are learned from reality. Thats why I use them to define reality and Einstein and Euclid had discovered the right ones. All observations attest to their veracity and if the are wrong, only Science can correct them. ... so if you think that keep reading... The problem with that is that it doesn’t take much to notice that, the result of 1 + 1 = 2 is not learned. The concept of parallel lines was not "discovered" by Euclid. These all started 2000 years ago precisely when Socrates noticed that even an illiterate understands that parallel lines do not cross at infinite. It’s obvious you will say. Well, again, perfect parallel lines do not exist. Where’s the obvious in that? No one has gone to infinity and verified that parallel lines do not cross. So, why do we see that they don’t so clearly? Why do illiterate people can understand that ? If geometry invented that it should be able to change it, but it can’t. We can’t just come and say: From today on, parallel lines cross at 100 meters, deal with that. No matter how many Euclidean geometries you find, or how many times the postulate is discredited. f) IDEAS make your mind So, the real problem is: Where did squareness, the number 3, parallel lines, and all those things came from, if they don’t exist in nature, they don’t belong to objects, and, at least some, we didn’t learn from experience or science? Kant is just saying that, as unbelievable as it might sound, our mind has these things "a priori" to be able to think. Those are like the alphabet, but not the story. At first glance it sounds ridiculous, but, at varying degrees, it’s undeniable: We could not have deduced many of these “IDEAS” from nature, simply because they are required to define nature in the first place. g) THE UNSOLVABLE? PROBLEM So here lies the problem: If your reason uses all these hard-coded ideas to present you the real world, we need to see the real world with no reason, to get the "real" thing. Now you see the problem? Now tell me again that :
