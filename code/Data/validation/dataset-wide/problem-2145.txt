I would monitor HOW OFTEN I do this. Just in case. Per person whom you ask (this sometimes matters). You may want to also take a look at how often you do this compared to others. And - if there's a significant difference - why. I would first search/research/try my own ideas for 20 minutes (or a bit more if the problem is larger). I would phrase my question appropriately, so others would know I've done my due. I would ask on SO sometimes, rather than in the office. I would try to come with simple rules for myself: when to (NOT) ask. 

Let's verify if they do then If they do NOT, do you want to change that or do you want to move? If you want to change that, I'd recommend changing their perception (thanks @BrianD for idea). 

Steps to help him stay From all my experiences, as an employee and as an employer, a decision for firing is made well before the "termination warning is given". However since other answers focus on "can't help him", let me offer you precisely the steps to help him. Let me say also this: I tried them, and they didn't succeed, my colleague was still fired. He was given an extension though and his firing proceeded in a way that made the team know more about it. Some of us chose to look for other jobs. Good luck to you. 

So, assuming it's (perhaps!) not just that junior who has this misconception; assuming your fears are about your promotion (will my boss think like this junior? will my other colleague fighting with me over promotion will tell the boss that I keep needing help in my tasks?); assuming you still want to ask for help (for reasons you do it now)... 

There's no defense, in a practical sense. There's been no written offer; and if there was one and the company reneged, your friend would have to go to Japan or hire an attorney there for any legal recourse - which is out of reach for most people. At this point if he's doing work for them, and there's no employer-employee relationship, then he needs to invoice for any further work and get paid as a contractor until the visa situation works out. Otherwise, he's letting them know he'll do work for nothing in return, and will probably never see a cent while they string him along until he tires of it. In short, there's some likelihood that he's being scammed. 

Current trends. Technology "clusters". For example, any Angular, jQuery, or Typescript development implies an understanding of Javascript. What the acronyms mean. (For a developer) If you don't grasp bigger-picture concepts like client-server, multi-tiered development, web services, SOA, and REST, as of the current market out there, this will be to your detriment. What interests you? Certain technologies might put a lot of money in your pocket, but it's not rewarding if it's boring as hell. What's going to be around for a while (i.e. how much support the technology has) because it's pretty stupid to wrap one's self up in something that will become obsolete quickly. Your own ability to integrate these technologies and actually make them useful. Some people just don't move that fast. What you can learn at low or no cost. Some technologies are just astronomically costly if you consider trying to teach yourself. 

If you're asking here, I'm going to guess that you haven't figured out that you must set yourself apart from the thousands of other people who graduated with your same degree and maybe even the same G.P.A. What is your practical experience in your field? Why should an employer hire YOU vs somebody else? These aren't questions that get answered in a college classroom. They are personal to you and you alone. You have to convey these same answers on a resume and during an interview if you expect to get anywhere. I had a close friend once whose whole spiel after graduating was, "Hi, my name is XXXXX, and I'm a recent UCLA grad, and I'm looking for a job." To which the prospective employer would reply, "Great. What do you DO???" My friend was completely lost - the degree was in Poly Sci, and I presume my friend learned a lot about a lot, but not necessarily what a person with such a degree would "DO" to create value for anyone else (i.e. a company). If you're giving the same response, now you know why you're not getting anywhere. Best of luck! 

Don't worry. Trust in your skills. If your company values politics and self-selling more than skills, consider moving. Unless there are people you like working with, that's usually a good reason to hang around for a bit longer. Enrich them if that's what you want or need (perhaps a new language or framework to get that promotion or move to that other promising company?) Evaluate your boss on whom he promoted in the past. Self-sellers? Smooth-talkers? Boot-lickers? Hard-workers? Tech wizards? X technology gurus? Then re-evaluate your chances. 

Monitor yourself. Set simple rules when you would ask, when you won't. Keep priorities of the job in mind when asking or asked for help. Weigh in how often you ask / are asked, how much time you / others spend on helping. Compare it to your rivals if you're worried about them overtaking you. Do your due for problems before you ask for solutions / help. Phrase your questions so other know it. Double-check that it's not an easy question, perhaps test how much your peers would take to solve it. Don't mind the junior, his comment may come from simple excitement, that this mighty senior, whom he has enshrined, has things he doesn't know and perhaps can be reached in time. 

Talk to manager about your doubts - ask why is he fired, honestly tell you don't see the reason. Protest his firing, if you strongly feel it's unjust. Ask for better conditions for him. Him having someone having his back speaks well of him, even if he is incompetent. You may give the manager a pause, a cause to rethink. If he pauses and then still goes with "fire him", then you know decision has serious reason and was made already. If the amount of work he was given seems unreasonable, verify that with other people. Ask them if they also think that. Tell to your / his boss that that's a bad move and it makes other people afraid that same will happen to them. Perhaps add "in light of talk about company going for sale people wonder how many staff we are to lose prior to acquisition". This is something that I honestly am hesitant to add, may hurt you and others if played wrong. Get your colleague to profess what he wants. You should know if he wants to stay or not. BEWARE! People almost always say they want to stay, while few months later, in new job, they almost always say they are better where they are now and staying would have been a bad move. How much of it is rationalizing and how much is truth, you may never know. In my cases they really seemed happier. Carefully weigh in that if you succeed and he stays, this will cause stress. He went through "termination warning" and had Damocles' sword above his neck. It's not gonna go away like that. So, your help doesn't stop on "him NOT getting fired". Consider it likely you'll end up diffusing several situations later on, where he (or management) over-interprets some words, actions. It's a large responsibility. 

IMHO, the names of these firms don't hold a lot of weight. What matters more is the type of work you've done, technologies used, transaction volume, and how much money or resources your work affects. Lastly, this is all underlined by how well you can communicate what I'm describing here to a potential employer or client. 

How many of these colleagues have been relevant in your life since you graduated? That determines how interested you should be in what they're thinking. They don't show up and do your work for you; they didn't interview for you; they don't live in your skin, and have not shared your circumstances. They don't pay your bills. Let's also not overlook the fact that anyone having a more senior position might not be enjoying the same quality of life as you. Titles are deceiving, but you don't know how any of these people are living at home. If "manager" or "director" means getting calls at 2 AM when stuff is misbehaving, or living out of a suitcase, who's actually doing better? Live and let live, and others will usually do the same for you. Don't buy into a perceived pecking order. Do your job, get along, and go home to your real life. As for those introductions - just do you. 

Absolutely! This is no different than listing relevant skills that are related to the position. If employees already on the "inside" can increase your chances of getting the job, why not? Do this ONLY with referrers who can vouch for your business experience. Don't do this if you've been referred by Grandma or Uncle Skip. 

It's probably not the work you're doing, but the stature of the businesses you're doing the work for. If you've done most of your work for mom-and-pop businesses, AND it's freelance, AND most especially if you didn't work in the office, it doesn't lend itself as credible if you worked on-site for a easily researchable company. You might look into certifications (even online) to prove your value. 

Let's start with a simple question: Is this about promotion? You mentioned cut-throat promotions right after this passage: 

I won't give you warnings about risking your job and so on. Others have given aplenty, that's one. Two - I think you yourself know your work environment well enough to know what will be risky and what won't. I believe that software tester and software programmer who have real skills, will be hired. There's huge demand. 

If my friend is doing demanding work, I may not ask, despite him most likely having the answer, unless circumstances are really favourable. Bosses look for people who get the job done. If they get others help it's OK, as long as lower priority task doesn't pull folks who work on higher priorities. So... don't pull others to help if they do work more crucial and don't BE pulled to help while your task has priority... unless circumstances really show this is how it should be. Competition in IT EDITed after @Cantalope's comment: 

Verification on the surface may actually suffice - that is, you may have your answer after round of brief conversations in the kitchen or during company after-party. Informal setting, simple question, done. "do you think folks like X or Y would admit they have a problem or they don't know the answer? I was wondering lately how we as a team stand on ." "I think X dislikes admitting to not knowing for he believes that makes him look weak. Would you agree?" Later just distinguish if he agreed with "he has this problem" or "it makes one look weak". Changing their perception needs to start from putting "asking for help" and "getting their input" on same level. First has ramification of you being weaker (to some!), second (usually!) implies THEM BEING GOOD ENOUGH to be asked. I usually use both, so the message is clear for everybody around me, that I consider them same. After a while, if I ask somebody for help in X, everybody knows the guy is good with X. Feel free to also employ pre-reviews, especially if you guys do code reviews. Get one technically sound person to pre-review your code and ask what can be done better. Follow on his advice. Then get him to review that code. Guaranteed approve, most of the time. Changing their perception is about showing them the power coming from being liberated and not having to pretend to know it all. Focusing on real job, getting shit done, using THEIR knowledge for it without care if this makes you look weak. Freely admit that team makes you stronger. Thank for good idea here or (jokingly) for "being of use there with this nifty test trick". Is this about reputation? How often you ask? How often you are asked? How much time you spent on "your due" before asking? How much they do? If you ask series of questions without doing basic research, your reputation may take a hit among your peers (not to mention folks lower in hierarchy). If I'm unsure how difficult problem I'm facing, I sometimes do a round and ask (in passing, marking I'm after quick-and-incomplete-on-the-fly-answers). If most of my peers seem to have no inkling about the issue or all are pointing to local expert, I know it's not just me. If some had, I can see if I need to improve here. Which leads to... Have you ruled out rusted (while basic) skills? Perhaps it was an easy question? Recently a very mature junior (older guy, changed careers, very deep learner) told me about seniors in his new workplace. Despite Java 9 coming out and Java 8 being out there for years, they never bothered looking at it and they keep saying how difficult it is. When he coded few things with Java 8, three of them rushed to his screen to look. He slowed down, coded this again so they would see how he did this, proposed he could show something about it if they wanted and generally never made a fuss, but he told me that it was a somewhat bitter-sweet feeling. So, while from your story it doesn't seem to be the case... double-check it. Perhaps your question is generally perceived as easy material? I had a few times asked for things that were easy to find and few moments with Google would've answered me equally well as my unfortunate co-worker who had to spent several minutes with me. I was quite embarrassed later when I found how easy was to find this in Google. Happens to the best among us, I think. Don't get me wrong here. Nobody knows everything. Having rusted skills is a natural thing. But so is being perceived weak - especially by those, who see those skills as a must-have. If in your job, coding is perceived as primary skill, and your coding has rusted (cause you are an architect for instance and are rushed from meeting to meeting), this will change how you are perceived. Deservedly so - strictly on coding-meter you are weaker than you were. Now couple this with bussiness-as-usual and you're too busy to spot this and too busy to fix this. So you ask for help more, because you know others may help much faster than it will take you to re-discover how this or that worked... Similar loss of credibility follows if you deemed an out-of-comfort-zone question too time-consuming while it wasn't (not doing your due before asking). Summary 

If I were you, I'd keep looking. I'm sure that if you'd received a formal offer letter, you would have shared that information with us. A formal letter would have the information you're asking about. Lacking that, and the fact that the job is seasonal, your information might have been thrown into a pool of other applicants deemed qualified as hire-able but as "overflow".. i.e. they get a high demand, then they call you; if they don't get busy, then you just don't get called back. If you've pressed for information and received a B.S. answer, expect B.S. behind the scenes. Sucks! 

There are more factors, but HR is not my line of work. I've been on the independent consulting side, and this information has actually helped me to make sure I priced my services in the right range. You can actually find certain organizations' service agreements with the agencies published online, such as here, here, and here. These examples (real documents!) include the markups, and the last one is extremely detailed. 

I deal with this myself. What works well is to enunciate the separate syllables of my first name, and to give a deliberate pause between my name and the word following. It breaks the "default" cadence of people hearing but not really listening. 

The above list applies to most languages. It'd be pretty useless to hire you if you still had severe deficiencies with any of the above. 

Umair, I don't know where you're located but if involving legal authorities is an option, that's one way. What sticks out worse is your comment about "Pessimistic approach towards payment collection due to fear of losing clientele". That tells me that your management doesn't know how to run a business. And because they don't know, you are hurting by way of slowing creeping into debt. I won't say "quit your job", but I'll say its definitely time to consider your options. You can't change the management.
