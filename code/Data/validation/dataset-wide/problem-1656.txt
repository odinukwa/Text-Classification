The earliest reference to the concert being for the purposes of tuition I could find online was from this bible.org page, which in turn references the book "Perhaps I am" by Edward Bok. 

Countries party to the agreement are self reporting, and not done by inspectors searching the country for weapons. If a country does not declare a chemical weapon cache to inspectors then they do not know about it. Countries party to the agreement are allowed to manufacture small amounts of chemical weapons (100 grams) for "research, medical or pharmaceutical purposes" According to some, new chemical agents are not banned under the agreement and are allowed to be produced by countries party to the agreement. 

Their claim for economic power shifting to Asia is an imaginary axis that shifted from the Mediterranean into Northern Europe, then in the middle of the Atlantic, before finally settling in the United States, and that it will continue to shift westward, with no sources or reasoning given. 

The study, when removing the pile of citations at the end, is only 2.5 pages long, significantly shorter than most scientific studies Of the 11 citations, 8 of them are in reference to studies that say that chemical sunscreen may cause skin irritation, one in reference to a single study regarding the effects of SPF-50 sunscreen and malignant melanoma, and two saying that there has never been substantial evidence that these waves can be imprinted on water. There is not a single citation in any part of the study after the introduction The author seems to want to make very sure that we know that he is skeptical of the science at the beginning, while also making sure to let us know he is a believer at the end. The sample is statistically very insignificant, only including 24 people, not controlling for race or skin type, only choosing participants who did not have medical conditions that would make them more vulnerable to exposure to sunlight. The author refuses to perform a double-blind study for ethical reasons, which seems like a convenient excuse to not provide comparison data. 

In terms of the type of weapon used in Mass Shootings, to illustrate the differences in definitions, I found three different reputable sources online that each reach different values. Statistic seems to present a number closer to 51%. Mother Jones puts it at 49.6%. CrimeResearch.org says that 76% of mass shooters have a handgun on them during the event, but count any event where the shooter is in possession of a handgun, regardless of whether or not it is used. 

The earliest I could find as a source for this quote online was in the talk page for Wikipedia's article on Adolf Hitler. 

While there is no direct video evidence of Mr. Shabazz at the protest where he said the quoted lines, there is evidence of Mr. Shabazz holding antisemitic, pro-radical Islamic positions. Mr. Shabazz claims that he is not antisemitic. However, he nuances this by being an advocate of the theory of Black Hebrew Israelism, a theory that states that some African Americans are descendants of the ancient Israelites. Shabazz takes this theory further and believes that modern day Jews are imposters. 

Deagel.com has been predicting a drastic reduction of the population of the United States for the better part of a decade. While their previous predictions are not available on their website, The Internet Wayback Machine has been cataloging the page since 2007. (Note that the predictions for US GDP values follows a similar pattern, but are not included here) 

Increasing the Standard Deduction Both plans propose to approximately double the Standard Deduction. The Standard Deduction is only used if someone does not Itemize their deductions. Again, without knowledge of Trump's tax return, we can not confirm, but it is highly likely that Trump itemizes his tax return. In 2013, 93.5% of filers making over $200,000 a year in income itemized. Since Mr. Trump is a billionaire real estate developer, it is very likely that he is well above this range and also itemizes. If he itemizes, this change has no impact on the amount of taxes that he pays. If he does not (and it is highly unlikely this is the case) this will reduce his tax burden. 

This source, and others online claim that the quote has come from one of Hitler's speeches to the Reichstag (German Legislative Branch), with some attributing it to 1939. The full text of all of Hitler's speeches to the Reichstag are available here, and a Google Translation of the 1939 speech (the only one not available in English) is available here. 

The tweet by Donald Trump was picked up by a number of news sources, including by Business Insider, The Chicago Sun-Times, Newsweek, and Politico, among others. None of the news sources have provided evidence of Trump publicly indicating that he believed Gillespie would lose. Some sources even call into question the truth to the statement. 

Instead of commenting on the existence of scalar waves and their purported ability to block UV rays, I investigated their own website to determine what their proof of this supposed finding was. Scrolling down to the bottom of the research page on their site provides us with this section. 

Furthermore, the Titanic was not the first, nor would it be the last, ship to sink due to icebergs. Wikipedia provides a non-exhaustive list of ships that have confirmed to have been sank with icebergs. A web archive of icedata.ca provides a larger list of confirmed and suspected sinkings due to icebergs. Nor would it even be the only ship to sink due to icebergs with a name similar to "Titan". The same source listed a Titania (note the slightly different spelling from Titanic) sinking due to an iceberg in 1880. 

The Express Tribune directly correlates this attack with the release of a movie entitled The Innocence of Muslims, described by Wikipedia as 

He even links to that article while claiming the statistic, which either means a misreading or deliberate attempt to deceive. The New York Times, for the most part, seems to be backed up by the Department of Justice, who keeps track of homicides by gun type. 

A single spent fuel rod is several orders of magnitude more radioactive than the radioactive waste produced by the manufacture of Wind Turbines for an entire year. 

This belief allows Mr. Shabazz to claim to not be antisemitic by claiming that the group of people commonly known as Jewish are not Semites, and therefore his speeches against this group are not antisemitic. 

However, even if you do not come to a settlement with the IRS, they are required to leave a certain amount of your wages. 

Behavior of spent nuclear fuel in water pool storage This report was put out in 1977 regarding the protocols and safety of storage of spent fuel rods within pools. The report itself is very long, but after skimming through it for about a half an hour there are a couple of things to point out. 

However, even at the worst point of the collapse of the Soviet Union's population (which was actually after the collapse of the Soviet Union as a whole) the population dropped from approx. 290 million to 285 million. This is a far cry from their projected 80-90% depopulation projection, and their entire thesis is based on several extremely radical presumptions. 

According to the Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center, yes he did. There is no direct video evidence that Mr. Shabazz said the lines in question, but positions previously espoused by Mr. Shabazz are in line with the quote. 

In the 2015 movie The Big Short, the character of Ben Rickert, played by Brad Pitt, makes the following statement to two investment bankers. 

Gun Violence Archives brings this into greater clarity with their statistics for 2018. They use the "4 or more injuries" criteria to define a mass shooting. By this count, they have 103 mass shootings as of 24 May 2018. However, by using the more strict definition of "four or more victims murdered with firearms, within one event, and in one or more locations in close proximity", the count is at most 10. However, of the 10 you have 

The events of the video are of an angry mob setting fire to the Sarhadi Lutheran Church in Mardan, Pakistan from 2012. No one was killed. 

(1) There is very little information on this Volkswagen, and it seems to be an aberration. Searches for similar cars return prices in the $10,000+ range. 

Before I begin, obviously, IANAL. Some of my sources will come from law advice websites that also have that disclaimer. 

General Lemay was not rejoicing over the death and destruction in North Korea during the war, as the tweet would have you believe. The quote is regarding objectively verifiable (and later proven to be exaggerated) facts about casualties during the war itself. General Lemay was describing that he had proposed a different plan of action at the start of the war, that was rejected because it would result in too many civilian casualties, and then lamenting on the irony of the war eventually killing a large number of civilians in a more drawn out conflict. While we can not know for certain, it is possible that Lemay's plan would have reduced the number of civilian casualties by bringing the war to a swift end. 

In terms of eating uranium, chances are that if he did, in fact eat Uranium, he did not eat enough of it to cause any lasting impact on his body. Ironically, the primary danger of eating uranium is not radioactivity, it is toxicity. According to the CDC... 

What is a mass shooting? There are some events, like the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, and the Columbine High School massacre, where everyone can agree that it should be considered a mass shooting. But what about this incident in Saginaw, Michigan, where 5 people were shot at a house party and no one was killed? Or this event in Madison, Alabama, where 4 people were shot and no one was killed? The Wikipedia article on Mass Shooting points out the huge issue in the definition of Mass Shootings. 

With the exception of the two school shootings, the Waffle House shooting, and the Car Wash shooting, many of these wouldn't even be considered mass shootings under this more restrictive definition. Some only hit the 4 deaths mark due to including the shooter, some take place in multiple locations, some involve family members, and some are possibly gang-related. 

Forbes, in it's "Winners and Losers" article after the Senate bill passed, included the President in its winners section as well. 

IT WAS VERY CLOUDY ON THE DAY THEY DID THIS TEST! I'm not surprised at their results at all and there is nothing notable about this study at all. They did a test with water on a cloudy day and were excited when only 1/3 of the people got burned. Honestly, I'm surprised the number is that high at all considering the weather. 

2. All radioactive waste is not created equal. The article uses "tons of radioactive waste" as if all waste is interchangeable. To quote Comparing the Amount of Radioactivity Found in Radioactive Wastes 

Einstein was also asked to write a congratulatory letter to Tesla in honor of him appearing on the cover of TIME Magazine in 1931. Einstein wrote 

Swimming in the pools is actually a fairly standard practice among workers servicing spent fuel pools. Divers are used to inspect the submerged fuel rods for damage, and are protected from radiation by the water itself. As it turns out, water is actually a very good radioactive shield, and divers are safe as long as they don't get too close. On August 31st, 2010, a diver servicing the Leibstadt nuclear reactor accidentally handled a radioactive piece of tubing on the floor of the pool. The diver was very deep in the pool and did not hear his radiation alarm go off upon picking up the object and putting it in a transport basket. The worker received a large dose to his hand, but was otherwise OK. As can be seen from the report, there was no loss of life or serious injury from the incident, and it appears that this was a case where the diver had picked up a piece of debris from one of the fuel rods and moved it with his hand. 

Corporate Tax Rate Both plans would reduce the Corporate Tax Rate from 35% to 20%, although the Senate plan delays this reduction until 2019. For business, this is a major boon, although (as the next section will detail) it is unlikely that most of Trump's businesses will be impacted by this, although for the ones that do, this will substantially decrease their tax burden. 

Mr. Shabazz has also advocated for theories that the U.S. government and Jews (presumably what he describes as "fake" Jews) were responsible for the 9/11 terrorist attacks. 

Under the article is a long note explaining their reasoning for the numbers of the United States (and Western European nations to a lesser extent). An immediate red flag is raised in the first paragraph, where they state in no uncertain terms 

They start with the assumption that any numbers released by the United States Government is a lie, and work from there. This conveniently allows them to ignore any data provided by official sources that conflicts with their results, a hideous combination of No True Scotsman and Cherry Picking. The explanation then veers suddenly off into a paragraph regarding the Ebola Virus, and asking readers to imagine a hypothetical scenario where the virus grew to Pandemic levels, infecting hundreds of thousands or millions of Americans. This entire paragraph ignores basic facts about the virus, including its transmissibility, its total mortality, and the fact that even the worst recent Ebola outbreak only killed 11 thousand people in Africa, a continent with much lower standards of hygiene. Of course, all that doesn't even matter because 

Factbase maintains a list of tweets made by Pres. Trump and allows you to search tweets made by the President. There are no tweets prior to the Virginia gubernatorial election in 2017 that are critical of Gillespie. Propublica maintains a list of tweets that were deleted by Donald Trump and only one tweet mentions Gillespie. 

Story 3 : The Cartoonist The man in the story is named as Harry Teller. A google search for "Harry Teller" Titanic only brings up references to the episode in question. A google search for "Harry Teller" cartoonist bring up no relevant results outside of references to the episode. Similarly, the supposed painting predicting the sinking is shown in the episode. While it's entirely possible that the painting was destroyed, there are no news references to a painting made prior to the Titanic sinking. This story seems to be wholly invented for the purposes of this episode. 

No where in any of these speeches does the quote appear. Furthermore, the way that Hitler talks about the Jews in his speeches is in direct contrast to this quote. 

The context of the quote is to make it sound like Einstein was complimentary of Tesla and respected him. However, the relationship between Tesla and Einstein was very contentious and they appeared to not get along at all. Tesla wrote a poem, "Fragments of Olympian Gossip" that directly calls out Einstein by name
