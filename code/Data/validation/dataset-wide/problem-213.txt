Secrets Most secrets are worthless, but if a character knew the truth about a person in power and how to prove it, the target would be susceptible to blackmail. "Fermat's Last Theorem," which Fermat claimed to have a proof for, would have been worth 6 million Kroner before 1995. Buried treasure is good, but compound interest is better: burying gold would not be as lucrative as access to interest earning accounts. Skills Skills have been covered by other answers, but FWIW, IMHO leadership has changed so much in the last 100 years that what it means to be a leader today is very different from what it meant historically. Charisma and publicity are probably a better bet. 

Saltgrass has not been mentioned yet. It grows in salty water, and excretes solid salt from it's leaves. Additionally, livestock can graze on it. After much experimentation, the culture follows the following recipe: 

Mafioso "It'd be awful if something happened to that lovely daughter of yours... I'm here to clean up this mess and protect the people of Italy-town." People who pay are paying "taxes", and people who don't get harassed by your thugs at night. The transition from this to governance is pretty short, though the profits of sin may prove too tempting... Warrior "It looks like the [neighboring city-state] wants our fields for themselves, our men for their army and our daughters for their slaves. [lets fear build] Let's take the fight to them!" Depending on how you play this one, you could get 2 city-states in one go. You could also lose both, depending on how clever/cut-throat the neighbors are. Capitalist From sugar to silk, there are always opportunities for actual profit. If you employ half a town with a new enterprise (filling the vacuum left by the dearly departed royals), you become the de-facto leader. The only remaining duty to fulfill is practicing diplomacy with the neighboring city-states, though you've done nothing to bolster your legitimacy as a ruler. The primary role of government in that time period was ensuring the safety of the citizenry. Make a threat seem real (or perhaps there are real threats) and then fix the threat. 

In a single generation? Probably not going to happen, if we're looking for a realistic total deconversion here. Give it a couple thousand years of silence, though, a dark age that destroys the paper trail necessary to verify the stories, a rising standard of living and education, and interactions with a society that doesn't share their religious views where they both have an incentive to play nice, and I think you might see it eventually fade away. Of course, it depends on the nature of the deity. What I describe would work in a sys-admin in the sky scenario. But if the deity exists within the same world as everyone else, that could make things more interesting. They'd have to find a way to escape detection for all that time, which could play into a "What if God was one of us?" trope. And if the deity fails to escape detection, well, there's all that hard work and waiting gone down the tubes! 

Absolutely. The human brain is nothing but a chemical computer, after all, and it's this chemical computer that gives rise to the mind. For me, the problem of causality is a watertight argument against any notions of duality. Once one embraces monism, I feel that the possibility of transferring one's consciousness to other substrates becomes obvious. Since dead organic matter as we know it now tends to spoil over the course of centuries, I think an intermediate step may be necessary if we're going to realistically make this happen within the next 50 years. I think mechanical bodies would be a better bet in terms of durability and longevity in storage. And if things end up taking longer to develop than planned (they almost always do, it seems), the mechanical bodies wouldn't necessarily have to house the consciousnesses controlling them. They could be "thin clients" (or "thin avatars" in this case, I guess) for the consciousnesses still in the megalithic computer on the "lifeboat." That would allow the survivors to then build organic bodies using what's available on whatever planet they end up on. Of course, cryogenics is another possibility. But that would be very energy-intensive compared to just making hyper-durable robot bodies that would remain switched off for most of the trip. My money would be on the robot bodies. Totally a possibility, because space is cold and most of the trip would be done with solar sails or something else of similar efficiency, as @bowlturner pointed out in the comments below. Note that you wouldn't need 3 million robot bodies, of course. You'd just need enough to allow everyone who needs to interact with the physical world to be able to do so. More is better to a point, but 3 million seems like it would be excessive. For technological paths that would likely lead to the vision you have here, look at neuromorphic computing and biocomputing. Again, due to the fragility of organic matter, I suspect biocomputing may be a dead end for transporting consciousness over the span of centuries. However, I also suspect it would prove to be very useful when it comes time to start creating organic bodies on the new home planet. Not sure if this has enough hard science for you, but hopefully it's helpful all the same! 

This isn't my field, but the exchange between o.m. and Shion got me thinking. When o.m. says that you would need a planet-sized mass, that isn't correct, right? Gravitational force is a function of mass vs the square of the distance. So, if you want earth-like gravity at the outer sections of a ship centered around a massive object, and your ship's radius is 1/100,000 that of the earth (so about 63m), then your massive object would only need to be 1/10,000,000,000 that of the earth. Now, I seem to recall reading something about the concept of inducing a black hole with a relatively small mass by compressing it to a tiny size. The context involved scientists using a nano-scale black hole as a perfect mass to energy converter. In other words, something that would let you turn anything into energy, by feeding in mass and capturing the energy that gets ejected back out. So, perhaps, in theory, you could create a tiny black hole with the mass of a smallish asteroid and build a ship around it. The event horizon would be too small to see, let alone be a danger, but you would have to figure out how to move it along with the ship, without any part of the ship being close enough to be damaged by it's gravity. This would also make maintenance an issue, as the closer you get to it, the more intense the gravity gets. From 1G at your main deck at 63m, you get 4G halfway to the black hole at 31.5m, and 16G halfway from there at 15.75m. Another concern with this idea is that it makes your ship incredibly massive for its size, which means you need a lot more fuel than you otherwise would. That said, if you can also use the black hole as an energy source by feeding it with whatever material you can get your hands on, it may not be too bad. Haven't done any math on this though. 

Wow! So many answers without mentioning any of the positives that women bring to the table. To be clear, there are feminine men and masculine women and this answer deals just with the advantages of typical and stereotypical women. Endurance Many answers have claimed without justification that women have less endurance than men. The truth is, women have plenty of endurance for the purposes of military activities. In fact, women hold all of the records for super long distance swimming. Risk Taking Behaviors Since women tend to take fewer risks, one would expect said fighting force to more rapidly evolve tactics that involve avoiding stupid risks, much as modern (after 2000) warfare is much less risky than its World War era counterpart. Culture Military culture has long suffered from toxic masculinity. There are real positives when soldiers obey without question, but creating that outlook is often just a high stakes power struggle. One might expect more good ideas to filter up the ranks in an all-female military. Equipment Smaller soldiers need smaller boots, smaller flak jackets, smaller weapons, smaller meal portions and smaller camp accouterments. The idea that a military wouldn't right-size their equipment for their soldiers is ludicrous. Fewer materials means lower costs, so each soldier will be able to travel just as far or further for a marginally lower logistical cost. War by Other Means War is kinetic diplomacy. If a country is more worried about its daughters going into battle than it was about its sons, one would expect the balance between diplomatic, espionage and military spending to find a more intelligent distribution. Babies Every military has a minority of war fighters and a majority of medical, administrative, logistical and research personnel. There's no reason that soon and recent mothers cannot carry out lower risk tasks during the 18 months per child that a pregnancy takes. 

One solution I don't think I've seen anyone else bring up is to not include the location of Earth in the ship's data. If there is nothing on board that would help locate Earth, then there's no target to redirect to. Don't even have to lie, just make it part of generation 1's agreement to not bring aboard anything that would help locate Earth. You might also need an odd route so that a path can't be traced back simply, and the ship would have to avoid saving data about this early maneuvering. Not sure how plausible this sort of maneuver is. I'm also not sure how much info would need to be censored to prevent future researchers from figuring out Earth's location by looking at simple things like old movies and books, and searching for planets that might fit the description. Of course, the farther from Earth you go before someone starts trying to find it, the less likely it will be possible. You could also send off a beacon of some sort ahead of the ship that would land on the destination planet in advance and which would contain any missing information about Earth, so that after the mission is successful, future generations could locate Earth for whatever purposes. 

Others have discussed code-breaking or code-making, which would certainly be useful, but my first thought was more direct: Artillery One of the early projects in computing had a goal of pre-calculating shell trajectories to support targeting in the field. This is the ENIAC project. I expect a modern laptop could generate the firing tables needed by artillery operators in a fairly short period, giving our side a massive advantage in being able to target artillery quickly in the field. Even if our protagonist knows nothing but basic programming, he should be able to go to the mathematicians working on these tables and coordinate to crunch all the numbers at a speed that would seem like magic to them. 

It's a scary fungus with incomprehensibly complex interactions, but ants are far simpler than humans. Perhaps rabies gets some DNA from Ophiocordyceps unilateralis or vice-versa. One could never hybridize the two because one is a virus and one is a fungus. 

It sounds like you want a situation where the disaster of a volcano is imminent, and so manageable as to be routine and not a disaster. Bad news, it's not a disaster. Agreeing wholeheartedly with Will, pyroclastic flows blow things up. Here you should read 'things' to include, especially, shield volcanoes. Since water is the usual ingredient in causing a pyroclastic flow on a shield volcano, you're doubly safe because the atmosphere is really boring 50 miles up - it doesn't rain on Earth even 5 miles up. If you did, somehow, manage to have some sort of highly porous rock that connected an ocean to a lava flow, and manage to keep not only that flow going uphill, but not going so much as to destroy your preposterously high volcano, you have another problem. You've minimized the size of the pyroclastic event which means that the volcano erupting 450 km away is barely worth talking about - the fiery, noxious gasses will be dispersed, cooled, and somewhat neutralized by simply existing in the atmosphere in view of the sun. If, instead, you're worried about lava (which is far more likely, given that it's a shield volcano), tons of people live really close to active volcanoes, but your volcano is huge. If lava managed to flow for the hundreds of kilometers from the caldera to the edge where humans lived (wildly unlikely), the odds of a human seeing the flow are minuscule unless the humans literally ring the entire volcano, including the riverbeds where the lava is likely to flow. In other words, your volcano is too big to make the disaster routine and imminent. 

So you take a "no limits" weight lifter and a regular weight lifter of identical absolute strength. "No Limits" would be able to lift about 250 lbs while "Regular Lifter" would be able to manage a little over 200 lbs. No Limits would probably be in a lot of pain until the muscles they wrecked were repaired, while Regular Lifter would just have tired muscles. Fatigue also appears to be another such limit. Your "no limits" people would be able to walk and run for ages, given that their "cores" would be constantly repairing the damage being slowly done to their bodies. They would also be able to forgo sleep without experiencing permanent brain damage. But the healing might take a while if the relative speeds of natural healing processes apply, however accelerated they may be. (Brains are really slow and hard to heal.) And they would probably still get dingy and hallucinate due to the toxins building up in their brains. 

A religion is a social organism, so a successful religion will have to balance its own needs with the needs of its followers. From my own experiences with and observation of religion, I think these are the core elements: Contradiction/Ambiguity Times change! If your religion is too concrete and too obvious about what it means, it runs the risk of falling by the wayside. Christianity has survived as long as it has because of the ambiguity and contradictions it contains. This allows people to build whichever version of your religion best suits the time and place they find themselves in, which increases the odds that one such version will end up surviving for centuries. The only "timeless truth" is that which does in fact stand the test of time. There's no way to tell for sure what that will be, so don't try to pin it down. Just make sure your religion can be interpreted in such a way that it encompasses whatever it may need to encompass. Growth & Maintenance Make sure your religion has elements that encourage its numeric growth, as well as elements designed to maintain current members. The Christian Bible has The Great Commission as well as verses like Hebrews 10:25. Scientologists are given the edict to "clear the planet" and famously persecute ex-members. Having regular meetings and events will help build strong social ties between members and make it harder for them to leave. Good Advice Most successful religions actually impart good advice to their members that ensure they'll experience greater success than a regular schmuck would. Christianity has stuff like "whatever you do, work at it with all your heart" and "do everything without grumbling or arguing." Some of Scientology's material reads like lifehack articles with batshit crazy stuff mixed in. If your members are not successful in life, your religion won't be either. Note that this doesn't necessarily have to be monetary success: Christianity gained a lot of followers in its early days due to the crazy quantities of courage it imparted to Christians as they were being thrown to the lions. In Rome's socially stratified society, lower-class people demonstrating impressive degrees of internal strength was very notable and persuasive. Powerful Members Related to the above point, but it deserves its own bullet because getting a high-profile member will raise your religion's profile. Christianity had Constantine, and Scientology has Tom Cruise. And early on, having members who are an asset to your fledgling religion rather than a drain can be very useful. You can either make your members powerful via good advice and social support, or you can obtain members who are already powerful. A mix of both is best. Meaning Your religion has to scratch an itch other things don't scratch. It has to offer catharsis and meaning. The primary value proposition of religion for a lot of people is that it frees them from the work of having to generate their own sense of meaning. Give them rituals, symbols, holidays, practices, or whatever else they like. Give them an outlet for things they can't necessarily let out in other spheres, and give them good rationalizations that let them feel they're simply misunderstood by a misguided world rather than the other way around. They're going to need some pleasure to balance the whip of your religion's good advice. Whatever you do, though, keep it simple. Otherwise your religion will be unlikely to achieve mass popularity. 

Not an expert, but I believe you can get a simple form of black powder from just charcoal and saltpeter. You need just the right type of charcoal, so that might take some experimentation to get right, but it's essentially burnt wood, so it should be easy to experiment with. Saltpeter can be obtained from human waste, so while distasteful, it's certainly doable. But this isn't something they could do on the fly, they would have to have been working on this for a long time already, but maybe they have just perfected their mixture and so you can still get some drama of them rushing to mix a big batch from their stockpiled saltpeter and a big effort to make the 'right' charcoal, followed by very carefully attaching a make-shift bomb and laying a trail of powder Wile-E-Coyote style so they can ignite from a distance. 

Actually, I think you might have a better shot with the opposite of famine. A post-scarcity world would have little or no incentive for war or conflict. I'm not sure this would work by 2020 if you're similar to Earth, but if you diverge enough, maybe. First step would be nearly free energy, so you're probably looking at an early acceptance of nuclear power, possibly followed by breakthrough in cold fusion (perhaps hastened by the cheap fission energy). Next, you need robotics advanced enough to replace all physical work performed by humans. So, you have a society where dirt-cheap energy is used to gather materials and mass produce every item a person might want, with no human interaction. Pretty much all wars are fought over resources, so that eliminates most war alone. Don't need to steal from a neighbor if you have all you could want. Another cause of war is ideology, which is where you get a lot of difficulty. I'm not sure it's possible to stop people from killing one another over things like religion or sports teams or whatever differences of opinion. One dominant ideology with totalitarian control might be able to do it. Or perhaps you could provide channels for conflict that don't qualify as war. Or perhaps you just lobotomize everyone, or at least indoctrinate them from an early age.
