It is not necessary to lay cables across the sea floor at all, it is only necessary to hang a cable from an antenna buoy on the surface and run it down to the underwater 4K TV. That way, atmospheric rules for radio propagation can be taken advantage of while still having a bandwidth that would be impractical underwater even with heavy multiplexing. Alternatively, merpeople could use laser communication between antenna buoys and their seafloor buildings, taking advantage of water's blue-green transmissive frequency band, and achieve a high bandwidth that way without cables. However, we could expect frequent interruptions by floating debris unless lasers were multiplexed and separated. Finally, if merpeople's structures were floating and anchored rather than on the sea floor (which might make sense for a mammalian, air-breathing species), then a rooftop antenna and a cable would be all that is needed. 

I have a series of weakly interconnected magical realms, in which there is limited movement between the realms. The technology in these realms varies from the medieval to the early 1800s. There is also magic very similar to that of the Ars Magica RPG system, however, I do not expect this to influence the answers to this question much, if at all. In many, but not all, of these realms, slavery is legal. In some realms, despite its legality, it is not common, while in others it is very common, and slaves may make up over 50% of the population. Slavery may be for life, life until the slave can purchase their freedom, or for a certain duration (typically 20-25 years) after which the slave must be freed or the owner is enslaved as a penalty. There are variations as to the rights a slave has, from none (other than that a slave is a chattel of a certain value) to being guaranteed a certain minimum level of subsistence and the right to life. In one particular small mountain-city realm of about 31 square kilometres, with early 1800s technology, slavery is legal, slaves have no rights, and slaves make up about 10% of the population, but slave-trading to nearby realms - quite a lot of them, given that the mountain moves about each day - is big business. While the slaves that are sold out of the mountain realm fulfil all the roles that slaves can be expected to fulfil, in the mountain realm, since agriculture is almost non-existent due to its climate, most slaves are employed in domestic services, manufacturing and service industries, which is to say simplistically that they can be house, factory, labouring, shop or sex slaves. There are also some slaves with professional skills. Slaves may be born slaves - the owner of a slave woman typically (this is the case in the mountain realm) has the power to decide whether her offspring will be slaves or free on an individual basis. Free people may sell themselves to clear family debts, or may be sold to clear otherwise unsecured personal debts that are sufficiently in default. The realms the mountain realm visits includes some where slavery is legal but non-existent, and some where slavery is illegal, as well as many where slavery is legal and common. However, the new goddess-queen of this realm is anti-slavery, having experienced life as a slave in some other realms on her way to the throne, and wants her kingdom to have nothing more to do with slavery. The Goddess-Queen is an absolute monarch. Her word is law, and she answers to no-one but recognises that she must at least consider public opinion if she wants her kingdom to flourish. What would be the best way to abolish slavery in this kingdom? Over how short a time period might this be accomplished? Please take into account what would happen to any freed slaves, how slaves, slave owners and slave traders might react, and how the society would have to adjust. In addition, since it is likely that the neighbouring realms would not be simultaneously changing their laws, how might relations with these realms change? 

If technology is "around" the same as today, and the artificial humans have red blood and other human fallibilities not common to computers, then the artificial humans would probably be the product of bioengineering. This would require a more advanced knowledge of the life sciences than our own, though probably not by more than a century. As to the cost of creating these homunculi, I would expect that the R&D cost would be quite high, on the order of billions of dollars over a great many years. After all, it is a very difficult matter to explicitly modify an organism that evolved essentially by random changes. This would have required sequencing the entire genome, understanding just how the telepathic types affect non-telepath minds, and understanding how to alter the human genome to counter the telepath's effects. However, once a package of viable modifications has been created, copying these changes to human embryos would be significantly easier and cheaper, probably on the order of thousands of dollars each. It would be a fiddly procedure quite like cloning, where the nucleus of an embryonic cell is replaced by that of the clone. Another alternative is that (eventually), the homunculus women would bear homunculus offspring, and so the homunculi would be self-propagating. A third option is that the homunculi are asexual or sterile, and they are produced by implanting an embryo into a human woman or by use of an artificial womb. Considering that the former would effectively be commercial surrogacy, there could be a cost of around US$100k-300k per pregnancy. However, if artificial wombs existed and could be used, their development would conceivably also cost billions, but individually they might cost on the order of tens of thousands to millions each, and each artificial womb's pregnancy might cost thousands of dollars in consumables and power. They would likely have a paid doctor overseeing them, but if the homunculi were mass-produced, one doctor would b able to oversee dozens of artificial wombs. 

I came up with the concept for just such a ship once for an RPG. It did not require any "antigravity" to make it float either. CONCEPT The basic premise that allowed the ships to fly and navigate was that there was a magical "keel" material that would easily move back and forth along one axis, but was very much harder to move in any other direction, though somewhat less difficult to turn. Thus, by holding the keel material in a particular attitude and pushing, an entire assembly could be made to gain in altitude and manoeuvre under wind power. The performance parameters of the airship would depend on the amount of sideslip that the keel material allowed amongst other things. The ship itself, as I envisaged it, would be a hull shaped like a boat-tail rifle bullet within which cargo and the keel mechanism would be housed, with masts that hold the sails. It made sense that there would be masts on all sides of the ship, from two extending laterally. to three in an Y (upright or inverted), or four in an X or a +. Masts may also be duplicated moving back along the hull, thus 4 or 6 or 8 with two sets of masts, or 6 or 9 or 12 with three sets. The masts would carry spars, sails and rigging that would catch the wind. A Lateral-only mast plan would have the advantage that the masts would not interfere with landing greatly, while two sets of X- or inverted-Y- masts could act as landing gear if they were properly rigged and reinforced. MANOEUVRING The ship would be controlled by using two or more independently controllable keels, mounted in gimbals fore and aft at a minimum, though the more keels there are, the more stable the ship. Since the keels move easily in only one direction, and resist movement (relative to their environment) in other directions, steering can be accomplished by properly angling multiple keels. With both keels pointing slightly upwards, the thrust provided by the wind will cause the ship to sail along in level flight. Angle them further upwards, and the ship will climb, and angling them down will cause the ship to descend. Angling the fore and aft keels up and down independently can cause the ship to pitch, and angling the keels sideways can cause the ship to sideslip or turn. With more keels, say 4, the ship can also be made to roll. There would be issues of stability that would require constant trimming of attitude, though this need not be accomplished by the crew; the gimbals could be equipped with damped pendulums that would hang downwards in the local gravity, and could be used to automatically keep the ship in the correct attitude, and might even provide automatic banking so that centripetal forces would not lead to objects sliding across the decks, but would automatically bank the ship. Like any sail-and-wind-powered ship, there would be issues of wind speed and direction, necessitating tacking or wearing in order to sail upwind, and affecting military tactics. In such ships, altitude would be as important a factor as being to the windward of an enemy, as it is a factor common to both sail and our self-powered flight that altitude may be traded for speed. By reducing sail in order to reduce drag, and descending, a ship's speed will increase significantly, and speed can also be traded for altitude. Navigators will also have to consider local wind conditions, including updrafts and thermals, though they would typically have lesser tactical implications than altitude and wind direction. LANDING Landing would be a matter of descending, shedding speed by furling sails and correctly angling the keels (extra keels beyond 4 would help here) to create additional drag, and allowing the keels' inherent side-slip to gently lower the ship to the ground. Take-off would be a little more complicated - there would need to be landing gear that would be retracted to allow the ship to float freely long enough to gain sufficient headway for the keels to provide enough lift to climb. COMBAT Weapons Considering the weapons that these ships might carry, Age of Sail had as its best weapon system black-powder smoothbore muzzle-loading artillery. The shot used in this period was initially stone or iron round shot, and progressed to explosive-shell round shot with time-delay or impact fusing. It would also be reasonable to suppose that we could have black-powder gravity bombs with time similar fusing. Rocketry existed in the AoS, but was lightweight and inaccurate, and used primarily for night-time signalling. Weapon Emplacement Given the complexities of air-to-air combat with smoothbore open-sighted artillery, we could expect that most combat would occur either at roughly equal altitudes with artillery broadsides fired from long cannon or short carronades, or at high/low altitude, with unguided bombs and downwards-firing guns against high-angle guns. It would be possible to mount a smoothbore artillery piece so as to be able to fire steeply downwards, but this would require ramming the bore with a tightly-fitting wad over the shot to prevent the shot from simply rolling out. In addition, the gun would have to be loaded horizontally, then tilted downwards and primed in an rear-facing flash-pan or flintlock before being run out. A downwards firing gun would require a rather different gun carriage, which would allow the gun to be run in and out vertically yet still remain secured (We don't want a loose cannon) and able to be tilted for loading. The breeching would involve counterweights so that running the guns in and out by hand would be possible. Downward-firing guns would be slower-firing and heavier than broadside-firing guns or upwards-firing guns. Armour In the AoS, the primary armour material was wood, though some ships had double timber hulls with the space between filled with stone; these were less successful. AoS naval ships could have very thick wooden hulls, often several feet thick, yet this armour was also a liability, as shot that penetrated the hull would be accompanied by a spray of splinters which caused more crew injuries and fatalities than the shot itself. Short barrelled carronades capitalised on this, firing large, relatively slow (and short-ranged) shot that maximised splintering and crew casualties, as paradoxically faster, smaller, longer-ranged shot caused less damage to both ship and crew. Ironclad wooden ships occurred near the close of the AoS, and were nearly invulnerable to roundshot, driving the development of ogival shells. In the AoS, there were also varieties of shot designed to maximise damage to an enemy ships rigging, including bar shot and chain shot. As much combat would occur on a level or high/low, warships may be designed with diamond hulls that would more readily deflect shot from the same level or from above/below, though to be most effective, the ship would have to be rolled to present the plane passing through the points of the diamond toward the projected trajectory of the incoming shot. This may be effective in 1 on 1 combat scenarios, but in a massed battle, the flat faces of the diamonds would be more of a vulnerability than a defence, and it could be expected that heavy combatants designed for massed combat would have round cross-sectioned hulls, those being most likely to deflect a shot coming from any trajectory Battle Formation In the AoS naval battles, a common formation was the line of battle, with ships lining up so that if an enemy did manage to "Cross the T" (to pass in front - or less effectively astern - of an enemy ship with its broadside facing the smaller, less heavily armed bow or stern aspect), only the lead or trailing ship would be particularly vulnerable. To extend the line of battle from 2 dimensions on the sea to 3 dimensions in the air, we would have a wall of battle, with lines of ships stacked so that the broad side of the formation would face the enemy, most commonly vertically or horizontally, but angled walls would have their place in some combat situations. Neutralising Enemy Ships In combat, an enemy ship can be neutralised in several ways:
