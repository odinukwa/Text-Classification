James K gave a good answer to this, but I just want to add that if the Sun was unmoving relative to the center of the Milky-way, it would fall towards the center along with your object. The sun orbits within the Milky way with tangential velocity about 230 km/s. It's rather pointless, but we can compare mass and distance and find the sweet spot where the gravitational pulls are equal on your object to the sun and towards the center of the Milky-way. The mass of the center of the Milky-way, where, the center is everything that draws your object towards it, not just the big black hole at the center, precise numbers are impossible, but a rough estimate of 200 billion solar masses can be used. That might be low, but close enough. The sun is roughly 26,000 light years from the center. Using the inverse square rule, the distance would be the square root of 200 billion, or about 450,000, and divide the distance (26,000 light years) with that number and you get about 1/17th of 1 light year. That's the sweet spot where the two gravitational tugs would be equal. This demonstrates the uselessness of gravitational strength at astronomical distances. Take the Moon for example. It's under greater gravitational tug from the Sun than the Earth, but it still orbits the Earth (or, you could say it orbits both), but stronger gravity doesn't govern the hill sphere. It's fun for calculating "how long would it take to hit the surface if I dropped it from . . . 1 light year", but beyond the occasional fun calculation, there's no real practical use. With 3 bodies the equation gets much more exotic, especially if one is orbiting the other and you add a 3rd and you want to know which way it would fall. The truth is, it would fall towards both, slowly, but if it got close enough to the sun it could get a gravitational kick, sending it further away for a time. Total energy is always conserved, but calculating the movement of that 1 smaller object with both the sun and a uniform massive center is a more complicated. 

Other scientists have pointed this out as a reason why funding for astronomy because, in time, it could play a role in saving our species. Stephen Hawking, for example. So you're not the first to think about this. 

As others have said, the full moon (date and time) is set by when the center of the Moon passes over or under a line that passes from the center of the sun through the center of the Earth. That gives the full moon a precise time, to the minute, that's the same everywhere on earth, provided you adjust for timezone. The "over or under" is important, cause mostly the Moon doesn't orbit in the same plane as the Earth's orbit, so it's usually above or below that line drawn from the sun through the center of the Earth. If it's near the Spring or Fall Equinox and they are more lined up, and the Moon passes very close to the line, then it passes through the Earth's shadow. In the sense of being a full circle in the sky, the Moon is never that, because that would require the Moon be in the Earth's shadow. That's why full moon's often appear wider than they are tall. A full moon often appears like a squashed ball, not a circle. Because by definition, a full Moon is full East to West, but not North to South. It remains within about 6 degrees of full North to South all the time, so that's generally ignored. But, unlike the new-years countdown, which happens one hour later for every timezone, the full moon moment happens the same time everywhere on Earth, day or night and whether the moon is visible in the sky or not. Unlike sunsets, most of us see the full moon as lasting the entire night and perhaps, even back to back nights. The specific minute of the full moon doesn't strike most of us as particularly relevant. "The moon is full tonight" is still a perfectly good thing to say, and "The moon was full 10 minutes ago, dang we missed it", would frankly be a strange thing to say, unless you wanted to catch it at Moonrise or Moonset - which can make for some great low to the horizon moon watching. But, if we look at the full moon as the night when it's fullest, then you have up to a 12 hour difference, depending on longitude, because night begins 12 hours later on one side of the globe, than on the other. (And the moon moves across the sky, so this takes a bit longer than 12 hours, but lets not get into that). Now, if you wanted to get silly-fussy and you wanted to know when the Moon would appears fullest to you. That's not an official fullest time, but that does change slightly depending on your longitude. It takes about 3 1/2 hours for the Moon to cross the Earth's diameter, so when it appears fullest varies by about that much time, depending on where you are on the earth and if the moon is visible. Our eyes can't detect a change in fullness that occurs over a 3.5 hour period. It's too small, so this is kind of an irrelevant point and not astronomically relevant, but if you wanted to define the moment when the Moon is visually fullest, not just the moment when it passes over or under the line through the center of the Earth, that would give you about 3.5 hours of variation from one side of the Earth to the other. I've never heard of anyone who felt that distinction was of particular use. The correct answer is that the astronomical full moon happens the same time everywhere on Earth. The point of view answer can give you variations of up to 12 hours if you consider full moon starting on the rise of the full moon during the night of the full-moon, or 3.5 hours if you fuss over the precise longitude of Earth as the measuring point of when the Moon appears 100% fullest. But those are point of view answers and not astronomical answers. Officially The Moon is full everywhere on Earth at the same precise minute. 

There is Methylamine in Jupiter's atmosphere. Saturn's too. This research study mentions "bands" of it. This one also discusses it. 

So, as the matter from the disk tries to fall inside the black hole, if there's too much matter, it can't all squeeze inside at once because mostly, black holes are quite tiny and the pressure and magnetism shoots a lot of the matter back out, primarily through the middle of the magnetic field lines. That's a kind of simple explanation anyway. Correction is welcome. 

When a system is mutually tidally locked with a nearly circular orbit, then it's very stable. If there's no tidal locking or one way tidal locking like Earth-Moon, then there's a tidal bulge that leads or follows the moon and that creates a force that can slow down or speed up the planet and push the moon away or draw it in closer. With tidal locking, there's no leading or following with the tidal bulge, so the orbit is less prone to change. There's always some orbital variation and some orbital energy converted to heat due to no orbits being perfectly circular, but mutual tidal locking is still a very stable orbital system with less change than most, as long as there isn't a 3rd party forcing change, such as a debris cloud creating drag or outgassing or orbiting close to a massive body that saps energy from the tidally locked orbit. No orbits are stable forever, and considering all the factors, Pluto and Charon are close enough that they exchange some atmosphere and as the sun grows more luminous over time, that exchange will probably increase, and likely both are losing mass slowly over time due to the solar wind. This very gradual loss of mass, I would think, would cause the orbit to expand, but very slowly. With no loss of gas by the solar wind, the Pluto-Charon orbit should very slowly contract due to tidal forces from the sun and some orbital energy being converted into heat, but both of those effects are very slow. Mutual tidal locking is for the most part a very stable system. Hope that wasn't too long, but that's the gist of it. My answer could probably be improved with some math and some linked references but that would make it even longer. 

Too long for a comment, but it's an incomplete answer. The gravity waves detected were from a stellar mass binary black hole merger, sometimes abbreviated bbh for binary black hole. The two black holes are thought to be about 36 and 29 solar masses with a final combined mass of about 62. So, roughly 5% of the black hole mass turned into into gravitational wave energy.

I don't think this is a bad question, and I think Pela is essentially correct, the effect is very small. Dark energy doesn't expand objects, for example, cause those are bound together, but dark energy should expand space between the sun and the earth though the effect is tiny. If we take this number, 68 KM per second per 1 million light years (link below), that's 245,000 KM per hour per million light years or about 1 KM every 4 hours per lightyear. With 63,000 Astronomical units per light year, between the sun and the earth, we can expect the earth (assuming it's in a perfectly stable orbit around the sun - which it's not, but lets say it is), a velocity of 1KM/30 years. And that's over the age of the universe. The earth/sun is only 1/3rd the age of the universe, so dark energy has accelerated the earth maybe 1 KM/90 years velocity since the formation of the solar system. That's a pretty small push. A velocity change of a bit a meter per year over the age of the solar-system. The effect of the solar wind and the Jupiter and Venus orbital tugging are probably greater than that. Source: $URL$ Now, over a few billion years, a small velocity change of 1 meter per year would add up - so I think dark energy is part of the solar system's long term orbital calculation. I might be wrong on that, but I think it has a measurable effect over billions of years even in distances as small as planetary orbits. But would it save the earth - I doubt it. The sun's heating up accelerates over time. It will at some point in the future, move too fast and get too hot for the earth, so, we'll have to save ourselves, either by moving the earth or terraforming mars, or building space colonies or some combination of all 3. The good news, we have tens of millions, maybe hundreds of millions of years to figure that stuff out. Dark energy has been useful though. It's probably kept us from crashing into Andromeda and/or the great attractor - however far away that is. Certainly delayed those collisions (We're never going to crash into the great attractor, I gather, thanks to dark energy), and crashing into Andromeda, when it happens, might harmless anyway, but I'm just kind of thinking out-loud. I do think it's a good question as there probably is some small expansion due to dark energy between the earth and the sun. If my numbers are wrong, I welcome correction.
