If God exists (the Biblical God as you mention), then there are certain conditions for you to be in harmony with God, a presumably beneficial condition for your life path. If those conditions aren't met, then the consequences are documented to you beforehand, and they are dire. It helps to be true rather than false in life. 

WE ARE DIFFERENT. We are not only governed by the laws of physics, for when we act with awareness, we have personal agency. No psychologist or neuroscientist has pinned down the origin or seat of consciousness. The simplest conclusion is that it transcends (strict) observability because it is the subject itself being observed and this forms a contradiction. I really wanted to answer this with my robot voice. EXTERMINATE. 

Yes, power on one axis/being would simply be distributed in time on the other. Given that they are eternal as well as infinite, the more likely scenario is that they're wise enough to negotiate the boundaries are. Since there is a documented story of one such infinite being gaving rise to another being, that is the likely trajectory of Man if and when He/She completes their journey of Knowledge. 

Yes, it is possible. Modern science biases itself on observation -- a powerful basis for an ontology of the world, but not infallible. You can start there, in epistemology and solipcism. I'll also give you this little nugget: empiricism is highly dependent on measuring instruments. However, every instrument implicitly encodes an ontology -- a model of the world. The problems of this should be self-evident. 

Reading Deleuze and Guattari's Anti-Oedipus, I am unclear on the nature of the Body without Organs. Most literature seems to describe this body as a phase space in the mathematical sense of the term, i.e. as consisting of all possible configurations of organ-machines into assemblages. This leads to the following characterization: Since D+G propose a materialist theory of psychology, the unconscious must 'experience' the world through the body's organs, which in the language of D+G means that all of our experiences (in the phenomenological sense of the word) can be characterized as machines 'grafted onto' our body parts, which they refer to as organ-machines. For example, the baby's mouth connects to the mother's breast to gain milk; this experience takes on the form of a machine: the mouth machines connects to the breast machine. The objects involved in these experiences are 'partial' in the sense of only existing in the unconscious as components of the machine, rather than as objects in of themselves. Hence the it is not really the mother's breast, but merely a breast, that is contained in the aforementioned machine. Since each such machine involves the body's organs into some machinic assembly, it can be identified with an 'organization of the body' or a point in the phase space (Body without Organs). The 'location' of this point is then recorded, with D+G's multiplicitous sign-systems consisting essentially of multiplicitous coordinate systems on the phase space. Two questions follow: 

The only "evidence" is by induction. The Law of the Eternal states that anything that can exist, will, given eternity. Posit: YHVH is the continuously-emanating singularity that we know as the Big Bang. As it is a singularity, it, perforce, incorporates other gods or demi-gods encountered within the Hebrew calendar (including the Christian one). Couple this with the actual first-hand reports and observation from the Jewish Orthodoxy, then you have sufficient evidence by induction. 

There is not actually an infinite regress. There is a long, subtle, and biologically ancient regress that you have adapted to unconsciously and simply called it you. But the interesting point, is that what you call "you", is shared at some point, at what your partner calls him/herself. That is, that long chain is connected to your listener's chain. That is what the purpose of dialog is: to continue working each others way down each's respective chains of causal thought until one reaches and creates through linguistic feedback the point in common in which you agree. Call it a shared "cultural meme", but consider that since your perception and cognition systems evolved along similar paths, it actually gets down to shared genetic ancestry. It's very much like the correspondence of physics and math. There the universe co-evolved with consciousness, so that there is a point in common that makes the universe have sense and not be simply and blandly arbitrary -- which would otherwise be its nature. 

Is the presentation of the disjunctive synthesis as a series "either.... or.... or... or..." a series of equivalent means of describing the 'location' of a particular body-organization in different sign-systems? Does the illegitimate use of the disjunctive synthesis then consist in restricting such to some finite set of sign-systems? How does the unconscious contain the Body without Organs? How can it contain all possible configurations of organs, since this is of course an infinite amount of information? 

To summarize, so far I have found two understandings on the BwO, neither of which seems completely reasonable. a. The BwO is a phase space (or attained phase space) for what D+G call the various "organ-izations" of the body, i.e. the various configurations of body parts into desiring-machine assemblages. Disjunctive synthesis operates at each configuration in the BwO (point in the phase space) to link together the representations of that configuration in the various sign-system. So for example we have "either a hand or una mano or la main or die hand or..." b. The BwO is an 'image' of the physical body as an undifferentiated mass, where every body part is in a state of quiet. The disjunctive synthesis attaches to each body part representations of all attained assemblages containing that part as an organ-machine. So for example we have "either a resting hand or a hand touching something or a hand touching something else or a hand making a rude gesture or..." Which of these is what we are going for in Anti-Oedipus? Buchanan remarks off hand that the "disjunctive synthesis... is functionally equivalent to Althusser's interpellation" - a statement that I can't quite make heads or tails of. 

The problem of your question is the idea of "nothing". What is nothing? Is it some black blankness? Where does that come from? Is it absolute 0? From whence does this order come from? The only answer to your question is to posit a Quantum Sea of Unknowability. It is neither nothing nor any particular thing. Consider it like heat or Hiesenberg's Uncertainty. Or, you can view it like S in physics describing Boltzmann's Entropy where S = k log W, where W is the number of states, in the case of the universe is probably something like infinity, but you also don't know the base of the log, and k (the Boltzmann constant) is a bias in present science in favor of the atomic model of matter. So, in the end, you can't actually quantify it. Get it? 

Some statements can be bullshit in the sense that the presenter is merely giving you a "word salad". He's giving you the option to eat it or not. It's much like the fortune program on Unix. It just gives answers, to no particular question. 

Communism (and the understanding by Marx) is such a different type of organization, that it cannot be studied from a classical perspective. Few academics have really understood the core difference between communism and socialism, for example, or if they have, they have not commented on it. To really understand it, you have to see the "State" as a type of organizing force (from above), that is simultaneously the individual himself -- an esoteric thing that is akin to a meta-consciousness, and the people within it akin to cells of that body. So there is no taxation, just as there is none within your body -- it is built to maintain itself. 

In Holland's Introduction to Schizoanalysis, the author states that Desire produces the Real analogously to the production of evidence in a courtroom: Desire structures and invests our perceptions. Consider the ardent natural scientist, completely convinced that only the hard sciences can offer 'true' knowledge. Can we accurately say that this person's reality is 'produced' in the sense of their investment of Desire into the scientific mode of knowledge? In short, does Desire produce reality in the sense of determining how we organize and percieve phenomena? 

If we resolve the problem of information overload by simply calling the BwO the 'attained' phase space or as consisting of those configurations which have been 'experienced', then it would seem we have a fairly cohesive picture: At the climax of the desiring-machine or equivalently, the experience, e.g. when the baby has had its fill of milk, the connective-synthetic bonds dissolve and their energy records a 'memory' of that experience in an (indeterminate) code of representation. Yet this seems to clash in some respects with the language D+G use to describe the recordings, specifically how they are "on" the BwO. We could instead take the BwO to be an image of the body as an undifferentiated mass, or equivalently at the point where every organ is in a state of quiescence; the disjunctive synthesis would then attach to each quiescent organ the phase space of possible (or attained) assemblages grafted onto that organ. For example, we have the series "either resting hand or hand-object A or hand-object B or hand-object C...;" all of which are written in parallel on the BwO's hand, so to speak.
