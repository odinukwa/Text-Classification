With modern running shoes, especially if you buy the same brand/model, there really is no need to break them in any more. It is only if you change models and/or brands that your first runs in them should be shorter, but that is in case your feet rub different in the shoes than in the ones you are used to. So it isn't so much your shoes but your feet that need the adjustment period. Walking in them won't really do much (At least IMHO, as I have never seen studies on it), since walking in a shoe and running in a shoe will have different stress/rub points. I would just hit the trail with them, but make them shorter runs to start until you know how your feet feel in the shoes. 

Especially in running, I am a firm believer in "If it isn't broken, don't fix it". The whole movement of Chi/Pose and extreme minimalist shoes has grown out of a misconception and bad application of "heel striking". Heel striking does not mean that your heel touches first, it has to do with where your foot is when the majority of your weight falls on it. Many top distance (5k and up) runners are mid to forefoot strikers, but if you look at slow motion video of their strides, their heels appear to be (and are) touching first. However, their legs are not straight in front of them, but slightly bent, and when their weight settles on their foot, most are somewhere between the mid and forefoot, as their body travels over the planted foot. If you really want to try VFF shoes, I would definitely wait until after your marathon. Transitioning from somewhat minimalist shoes like your Brooks to VFF is going to take a while, and you don't want to still be transitioning or stuck "between" shoes going into your first marathon. 

It's not the heat loss through the head that you are feeling(The whole 90% of heat loss is through your head thing is a myth), it's the cooling effect of the cold air on wet skin. A cap will help prevent that, but it's not going to do much for actual heat retention until you start getting into the neoprene caps, which are designed to be warmer than traditional latex caps. So yes, they will help some, but if you really need a warm cap then look at some of the thicker, neoprene rubber caps. 

I have recommended this plan before, and the simple reason that I continue to do so is that it works. On many levels from recreational to highly competitive. 3-2-1. Take whatever distance is your longest achievable. For this example we will use a 10k run, and theoretically this is as far as you can currently run in one shot. To complete this run takes you 45 minutes. This would be the 1 of the 3-2-1. For the other runs, the 2 runs will be 30 minutes each, and the 3 runs will be 15 minutes each. Don't worry about pace too much, just run easy. Hard will come later, and as you get more fit, your pace will naturally increase of its own accord. Structure it along the lines of short (15 min), medium (30 mins), short, medium, short, long (45 mins), day off. This gives you a starting point of about 33k or so for a week. You want to gradually build this up, usually a 5-10% increase in distance every couple weeks depending on training intensity, your own tolerance, things like that. This is where your own personal monitoring comes in, you should be able to feel if the last week left you beat up, or if you feel good enough to add a little extra training. Initially you'll want to just concentrate on building up distance to where you could complete the 80k run. This may take a year, it may take 5, just depending on how you react to the training, and how much attention you pay to things like rest, recovery, nutrition, equipment, etc. Once you are at the point where you can complete the distance, then you can start looking at adding in speedwork and other higher intensity workouts to be able to compete the race, rather than just complete it. 

Weightwatchers foods aren't too bad, and they are one of the better alternatives as far as preprepared foods. Mostly the problem comes in with high sodium and sugars to make it palatable and extend shelf life. When you say you aren't able to cook, you mean you don't know how, or don't have the facilities for it? If it's the former, I would recommend just getting a recipe book, and finding some dishes that you would like to try. Figure out how to cook them, because fresh food is always going to be better than prepackaged. One of the tricks that I use is that I will spend an hour or two on the weekend cutting up veggies, grilling chicken, etc. That way during the week if I need a quick dinner I can take a pita, dump in chopped up chicken, chopped up veggies, and some tzatziki that I get from the store, and I have a tasty quick dinner. 

There are some benefits, however there are also some attendant risks with isometric exercise. First, isometric exercise doesn't really build much strength overall, they really only build strength in that one position. They can help maintain strength that you have already developed, however and it can be very useful in a rehabilitation type setting. These types of exercises (Since there is no motion) won't really help speed or athletic performance either. What they can do very well, is increase the effectiveness of stabilization muscles, as they are forced into greater and greater recruitment to sustain the isometric contraction. There is also some recent evidence that it can help to lower resting blood pressure. They can also be useful exercises if you have a lowered range of motion due to disease (arthritis) or injury. These types of exercises do raise blood pressure during the exercise, and if you intend on doing them, be aware of intensity and not holding your breath, as these are two other factors that can also raise your blood pressure dangerously. 

Your triceps are much weaker than your biceps, and/or you are using too much weight for your level of training. Lower the amount of weight, and try again. If you still have trouble, that points to #2: Your form is wrong. Get a trainer to look at your form and make sure that you are doing the exercise with correct form. 

I assume that you are using the grip with your palms facing forward, palms facing inward will tend to emphasize the biceps more than the lats. The visualization that works for me, rather than thinking of "pulling" from the elbows, is thinking of "squeezing" the elbows to the body. Stand up, and place your hands and arms in the position that you would be in if you were about to do the press part of a clean and press. (Palms should be forward). Now, squeeze your elbows into your body. As you do this, your chest will probably push out a couple inches, that's ok. That is the ending position of a pullup. Now, resisting the motion with your lats, push your hands and arms upward until they are over your head. That is the motion that you want for your pull up, and that should give you the feeling of lat activation through the entire exercise. 

This is very much an individual question, as everyone has different requirements and reacts in different ways to fluid and food intake when running. It's just very much trial and error to find what works for you. However, what you can do is start tracking your runs, time of day, how you feel, what you ate, things like that. Over time, you will get data such as "Ate right before run, felt really bad", or "Took gatorade, cramped up". Once or twice isn't really significant, but if you consistently cramp up or feel bad after doing something, you know that you shouldn't do that during a run. The other thing is being able to tell what your body is telling you, such as if you are really tired, and should postpone or cancel your workout or if you are just kinda blah and should work out anyway. That will also show up if you track how you feel in your journal. There's a lot of ways to go about it, but the biggest thing is just analyzing different situations and how your body reacted to it, to be able to know that when X happens, Y will follow soon after.
