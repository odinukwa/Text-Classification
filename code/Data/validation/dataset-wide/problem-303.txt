The Shire. As you can see from the image, the breed is tall enough for a human to crane himself upwards to see its face. The tallest on record was a gelding named Goliath, who stood 19 hands (76 inches) tall at the shoulders until his death in 2001. The Shire belongs to a type called the "draft horses", and they have a great capacity for pulling weight. But if I were to breed a Shire with an Ice-Yakut (I'll work on the name later), the foal would be of an intermediate size--anywhere between 13 and 17 hands tall, larger than an Ice-Yakut but still smaller than a Shire. This Ice-Yakut/Shire hybrid will... 

If we ignore that then there is no further answer to be provided, since the leftover question of what would happen to society is very opinion-based. A more realistic scenario would be a world-wide EMP. But the problem of the question being mostly opinion-based is still there. 

EDIT: Bridgeburners pointed out that since it's time dilation by velocity and not gravity you have to take into account that it is a more difficult scenario and the perceived time changes strongly depending on the observer. I did not properly clarify that this might not be the effect you were going for. 

One of the recent talks regards expanding our cities to colonize the oceans, which many find to be more feasible than colonizing another body in space. So far, we have not gone as building a permanent, metropolitan establishment, but when that comes, some issues obviously need to be addressed. Fishing and greenhouse farming have been considered, so finding food is not a problem. Other problems are not so straightforward to solve. In the maximum depth of 350 feet, pressure is added, perhaps close to human tolerance, so what our main facilities need is an architectural shape best suited to withstand that kind of pressure. By choosing the three basic shapes--pyramid, box and dome--which one suits maximum? In relation, glass does not react well to added pressure, either. That's why deep-sea diving submersibles have thick windows that are small in area and/or circumference. At a maximum depth of 350 feet, would a window in a permanent underwater city also need to be small and thick, too? If so, by how much? Certain materials withstand pressure differently. Roman concrete has this unique ability to harden as it gets older and keep water out, which may explain how it has survived the past 2,000 years. Would this work in a marine city with a maximum depth of 350 feet, or would something else make for a more durable foundation? Another problem is how to get a constant supply of oxygen. I could personally suggest planting each main facility with a chimney tall enough to break the surface, but is that feasible? If one wants to spend the rest of his life beneath the surface, he would prefer to be dry. So how does one open and shut doors without drowning the entire corridor in the process? The one final issue is finding fresh, drinkable water. I have no idea how that could be accomplished. How would all those listed issues be addressed and solved? 

Simulate printing the message. The scientist could do absolutely anything here and I have no way of predicting what specifically will happen. Predict with perfect fidelity all second and higher order effects that will happen as a result of (whatever happened in step 2). Make recommendation 

You have here a machine that can accurately simulate the next several decades after printing that message, but not the next several minutes. But even assuming that it can simulate the scientist as well doesn't fix things. If the machine can accurately predict what the scientist can do, then the scientist doesn't have to destroy the machine, since what the machine predicted was that the world in which it printed that message is the ideal one, not necessarily that the world in which it was destroyed is. The scientist does whatever they want to, and either the computer simulated the scientist's reaction correctly, in which case this leads to the good outcome, or it didn't, in which case the simulation is flawed and the scientist shouldn't be making decisions based on it in the first place. 

The premise of your question is flawed It would mean that you have such a huge radiation density that it would most likely severely effect any living thing. Blocking (or jamming) wireless transmissions is not that difficult, but already takes a lot of energy if you do it locally. If you want to block every wireless transmission everywhere that'd be insane amounts of energy being pumped onto the earth. Probably more than the suns, since the atmosphere blocks most of that radiation. If you want to block wired transmissions you'd need even significantly more than that. You would need insane amounts of radiation on every frequency from 1Hz to 100GHz. Most of the frequencies are not very reactive with biochemistry, but some are. And also the frequencies used in current day technology are effecting biochemistry. Most of those are used so little no actual harm comes from it, but the amount of energy your proposed radiation would mean would destroy a lot. And it would also boil water, probably. (WLAN: 2.4GHz, microwave: 2.455GHz) I think even if you would ONLY have EXACTLY the frequencies we use for communication the side-effects of the radiation intensity on biochemistry would still be destructive. To conclude: Society would probably not exist anymore since everyone dies of cancer, radiation poisoning and other things. 

Have alternate plausible explanations for how they got the information. The British interception of the Zimmerman Telegram is a good example of how this can be done. In WWI, the British intercepted a telegram sent to the German embassy in the United States, and upon decrypting it, determined it to contain information that if revealed to the U.S. might get them to join the war. Specifically, it was an offer for Mexico to ally with Germany and invade the U.S. in the event that the U.S. joined the war in Europe, along with plans to engage in unrestricted submarine warfare. However, the telegram was sent over a U.S. cable that the U.S. didn't know the British were tapping, and encrypted using a cipher the Germans didn't know had been broken. The British needed a way to share the telegram with the U.S. and convince them it was genuine, without revealing either of those facts. Since the British knew the contents of the telegram, they knew that it would have been forwarded to Mexico using a lower-security cipher. The British had broken that one too, and they didn't care as much if the Germans discovered that. So they bribed a Mexican telegraph agent to get a copy of that version, then decrypted it and sent the plaintext version to the U.S. along with an explanation of how it was decrypted. Since the U.S. telegraph offices would have copies of the ciphertext version, they could decrypt their copy and compare with the one supplied by the British to verify its authenticity. So at this point, the only thing that might suggest that the British were tapping those lines or had broken the original cipher is the question of why they decided to steal the telegram from the Mexican office, but that's something they might plausibly have done without knowing the contents, so they were able to safely share the information with the U.S. embassy. 

It would work (within reasonable limits) There is always side-effects to tampering with brain-chemistry. If it was the best for the brain to simply work faster then why would it not have evolved that way? Of course you burn a lot more calories, but there is other stuff, too. Hormones might be released and you get into emotional distress or you could have long-term effects like depression or dependency. Differing results Let's take current day drugs that work with brain-chemistry in different ways. Marijuana as an example. It does different things with every person. Of course the main tendency is to calm them down and make them hungry, but for some rare people the same strain causes panic attacks, paranoia or even psychotic episodes. (note: marijuana is a rather weak drug and is comparably not that dangerous) Body chemistry imbalance Also the side effects do not even have to be psychological or neurological issues, but can make your body chemistry go nuts and cause an imbalance in other organs causing them to malfunction when effected to severely. Physical limitations Then there is also the hard limits of the body. In the human body a signal travels about 128 m/s. So even if you were to enhance the speed in which neurons fire you wouldn't greatly increase that speed. If a signal is supposed to travel 20cm in your brain it would at least take 1.5ms to reach the destination. You can not enhance the 'computational power' indefinitely. Conclusion There are already methods to enhance focus, but they all have side-effects to some extend. None of the methods can boost indefintely. You could argue that an aliens physiology might be better "boostable" and with futuristic technology it can work to much stronger extends, but even then it will have its limitations. There is no inherent issue with "boosting" biochemistry. Just side-effects and limitations. 

As others have pointed out, you can't spontaneously apply a new mutation to every virus (or whatever) at once. If one population of the virus evolves into a lethal strain, the new strain needs to start infecting the human population from scratch. But suppose that the original strain, while otherwise harmless, weakens the immune system in a specific way that prevents it from being recognized as a hostile body. This is beneficial in of itself, since it allows the virus to remain in a host indefinitely, and not harmful to the host as long as no other illness exists that takes advantage of the weakness. But suppose that after this original strain has infected the entire population, a new strain mutates in such a way that it becomes lethal after some incubation period. The lethal strain still needs to spread normally, but because everyone is already infected with the original strain, their immune systems have already been modified to ignore the new strain. If it's airborn, it'll spread extraordinarily quickly, even once it turns lethal and quarantine measures are put into effect. Presumably, there would be a few places that are isolated enough to keep the disease out, but most of the world would be helpless to stop it from infecting the majority of the population. 

The brain is not one big module with a single task. It's a big cluster of semi-interdependent modules each working on their own - and sometimes conflicting with one another (e.g. mental disorders). (for reference: Robert Kurzban's "Why everyone (else) is a hypocrite") This structure implies that the mind and personality are not as simple concepts as you might think. You can not easily define what makes a person or a personality. And you can not transfer that from one person to another person without entirely rewiring the "host" brain. You also can't transfer modules as the connections of modules need to work in specific ways with other modules - maybe the other brain doesn't have these. A brain only consists of structures it needs. There is no "free space" to be taken by something else. You can't just cram more stuff in there. Especially not twice as much - like transferring another personality in there. The basic premise of your question is contradicting science. Therefore no one can give you any scientificly valid answers to your question. If you want to write about that, you can make up something fictional. 

Normal people may not care about scientific advancement, but fortunately, we don't need to rely on them, even in a democracy. In the U.S., for instance, a lot of funding comes from the National Science Foundation (NSF) and National Institutes of Health (NIH), as well as a few Department of Defense groups, e.g. DARPA. Let's take the NSF as an example. Each year, they request a budget from Congress (in 2017, it was about 0.2% of total federal spending for the NSF) and give them a high level overview of how the money will be spent and examples of the sort of impressive things NSF funding has supported in the past. But then once the NSF has its budget, qualified people decide which research grants will be supported, so even if a research project only has long-term benefits, it will still get funded if it's a promising idea. Another major source of funding comes from industry. In addition to in-house research, companies will sometimes send funding to academic researchers working on topics relevant to them. Even if they won't be the only ones to benefit from the research, they don't need to invest any time or employees into the project, so if they have the money to spare, it can be a good investment. (It also buys goodwill from potential future employees.) And finally, a base level of funding comes from the universities themselves. Undergrad tuition pays salaries, and offering solid research funding will attract good professors to the institution. The average citizen may look at something like a particle accelerator and say "That will magically create a black hole and kill us all". A congressman may look at it and say "That won't have any practical benefits before the next election". But the NSF people will look at it and think, "That may reveal information that will open up new avenues of research in 50 years" and fund it. The more short-sighted people just need to know that funding "Science" has always paid off before, so if we show them that it has, they'll keep funding it. (That came out as a bit more cynical than I intended, but if I'm being honest...) The average citizen of a democracy doesn't necessarily understand or even care about specific research projects, but as long as you have a good research infrastructure in place, they don't need to as long as they're interested in having technology continue to advance. 

As Raditz_35 pointed out: You could argue either way. But: The technologies do have a similar basis - the robotic parts, but cybernetic stuff has a lot more to do with making those things part of your body. There is medical and neurological components, too. You can't just implant robotics into a person. Currently the two fields are closely entertwined, but this would not have to be, as you could imagine cybernetics to be illegal. To conclude: Without advanced robotics you can not build advanced cybernetics, but cybernetics is not something that simply follows robotics as there are lots of other things that come into play.
