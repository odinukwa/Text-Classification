The paper is long and careful, and in any scientific field of classification, there is a huge amount of work and thought and discussion that is sometimes difficult for those outside to understand without the necessary background. The last two sentences of the abstract read: 

I would like to know more about how the image was processed. What does it look like before the uniform disk is subtracted - is the radio emission from the region around the planet actually as strong as the planet disk itself, as this image suggests? If there is a reference for this image I'd also like to read it! In the mean time, it really is beautiful! The image is sometimes paired with the following image, taken here from Science News. 

In a close-orbiting binary pair, a small but significant fraction of the light from each star falls upon the other, and the result has to be carefully modeled to simulate the observed spectrum of the system as it rotates. One effect is that each stars radiation will non-uniformly heat the surface of the other star and alter its thermal radiation, but here I'm asking about light from one star being scattered or diffusely reflected by the other. How is this scattered/reflected light calculated, and roughly what is the spectral reflectance? Of course each star will be different, so one example or maybe two would be sufficient. We often treat stars as blackbodies as an approximation, suggesting that stars have low albedo, but at some depth the electron density will be high enough so that the plasma frequency reaches visible wavelengths, increasing reflectivity, though that may be too deep to matter. 

I don't see anything about this data that strikes me as unmeasurable with even say 1970's technology if done carefully. The signal is huge, a distinct, broad (about 19 MHz centered at about 87 MHz), several percent (almost 0.6 K) deep dip in an otherwise Rayleigh-Jeans regime blackbody distribution. In 20:20 hindsight, it seems to me this could have been detected a long time ago. Question: Am I missing something, or is this discovery remarkable not only for it's far reaching implication, but for its simplicity, elegance, and the fact that it could have been discovered quite a long time ago with '60's or '70's technology?

The intuition in the question seems to be that if stars get lighter and this makes orbits widen, maybe the same effect explains why the universe "widens". Stars are converting some of their mass into light, but this is a small fraction: the efficiency of fusion is about 0.5-1% of mass into energy. And many stars will not burn all the fusible matter in any case. Brighter stars also tend to lose mass through stellar winds, reaching rates up to $10%{-6} M_\odot$ per year or above. Starlight tends to escape galaxies, while the stellar winds mostly feed the interstellar medium. Most mass hence remains in the galaxies and stellar activities cannot explain their accelerating expansion. The small amount of escaping starlight and very hot gas does make galaxies a bit less strongly bound in clusters, but it is small compared to estimated dark matter halo masses and (maybe) infall of intergalactic gas. 

The idea of removing material from the sun for either fuel or to lengthen its lifespan is called "star lifting". Various hypothetical methods have been suggested, including heating parts of the atmosphere or squeezing it using magnetic fields. My own tentative suggestion is to combine these with chaos control to manipulate turbulence into making coronal mass ejections in desired directions. The problem is not just that the sun is hot (5777 K at the surface), but that the stuff that is easy to scoop up with a huge magnetic field is a fairly sparse plasma - you don't get that much material despite the vast scales. Of course, you may want to compress the plasma into a smaller and more convenient ball, but now the ideal gas law tells you that it will heat up proportionally - to get a cool hydrogen ball you will need to bleed off all that heat slowly. Which is why I think Dyson spheres are probably the easiest way to start. 

Brown dwarfs are heavier than Jupiter (jupiter has mass 0.000949 solar masses), although about the same size. Their compositions are fairly similar, with brown dwarfs depleted in deuterium if they are heavy enough (it is burned over a few million years after formation). Adams & Laughlin modelled the collisions of brown dwarfs, mainly to estimate whether two dwarfs could merge to make a star heavier than 0.075 solar masses that would begin hydrogen fusion properly. They found that this could happen, and not too much mass appears lost as they splatter into each other if it is a somewhat glancing collision. Obviously, a near glancing hit might just scatter some of their atmospheres but not stop them. Jupiter would likely behave the same. The result would be a heavier brown dwarf. It would be heated significantly by the energy of the merger, which in turn would make it expand to a larger size until it cooled down. Jupiter would also contribute deuterium so if the dwarf was heavy enough it would further heat up for a while. Given Jupiter's minimal mass compared to the 0.075 limit it is not likely it would be enough to turn the new object into a red dwarf. 

I see this kind of projection of the celestial sphere into 2D frequently, usually with an image of the milky way galaxy or cosmic microwave background. This particular image shows the path of visible transits of the inner solar system planets across the sun as seen from locations outside of the solar system from the Motherboard article At Least 9 Exoplanets Could See Earth With Present-Day Human Technology which links to: R. Wells, K. Poppenhaeger, C. A. Watson, R. Heller; Transit Visibility Zones of the Solar System Planets, Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, stx2077, $URL$ Question: What is the 2D elliptical projection of the Celestial Sphere called, and how can I make one? Is there a python-friendly package, but more importantly, is there a mathematical expression for this transform? 

The most recent and farthest-from-earth telescopic observations that I know of are from the New Horizons spacecraft and it's Long-Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI), a 208 mm (8.2 inch) diameter Ritchey–Chretien telescope equipped with silicon-carbide optics and a cooled silicon CCD imager with a resolution of about 1 arcsecond: 

What I'm looking for is a graphic that shows in a general way the best available telescope resolution vs wavelength throughout the entire wavelength spectrum. So for example, there might be two very high resolution peaks aroud

Is there an established distinction between a geyser and a cryovolcano in the context of cold solar-system bodies such as the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, or Kuiper belt objects (e.g. Pluto)? Both can lead to spreading of new water across the surface, and both can result in plumes of water vapor above the surface. Do they have distinctly different mechanisms? 

Heres more python than you can shake a telescope at. I just used @RobJeffries' algorithm. This is just a python script, the real answer to the question is @RobJeffries' answer and I've just scripted it. The mathematics behind generating statistically uniform distributions is explained very nicely there as well. Python is below the plots. You can see on an X-Y graph they thin out at the top and bottom. The 3D plot is live, you can use your cursor and move the sphere around. Of course not HERE :-), but in your own python window if you run the script. 

The sun is within a few parsec (15-25 pc) of the galactic plane, slightly above. The thin disk of the milky way (containing ~85% of the stars and gas) has a density going roughly like $\rho_0 \exp(-|z|/300 pc)$, while the thick disk (older stars, a few percent) has a scale height of 1000 pc instead. So if we want to move up (galactic north) above 90% of the star density we would have to move ~680 parsec, and going down 720 parsec. At this point at least the view would be splendid, but there would still be a fair number of thick disk and halo stars above and below. The disk has a scale length of 2.5–4.5 kiloparsec (kpc) and the sun is about 8 kpc away from the core, so we are already outside nearly 90% of the stars (not even counting the bulge). The radius is commonly given as 15.5-27.5 kpc, so we are 7.5-19.5 kpc from the nearest edge and 15.5-27.5 kpc from the far edge. If we count the dark matter halo the distances get even fuzzier. The virial radius (a rough measure of where most mass is inside most of the time) is 200 kpc, so we are basically 200 kpc away from that distance in most directions. 

Black holes can orbit each other (we know this from the gravitational waves from their eventual mergers) and there is no particular reason against a small black hole passing through the ergosphere of a large black hole. The main problem is avoiding a merger. The the two-black hole spacetime has no analytic solution and numeric simulations are messy, but a merger will definitely happen if the event horizons overlap. In any case, a rotating black hole has an ergosphere with an equatorial radius of $2GM/c^2$ and event horizon somewhere between this and the limiting radius $GM/c^2$. If we use the extremal case, then we can presumably just barely fit in nearly an identical mass and rotation black hole in the ergosphere. More likely a much smaller black hole could fit in. The direction of rotation would matter for the dynamics, since counter-rotating black holes would tend to coalesce (see this page for a plot of the relevant radii and where the innermost stable circular orbits are). A single black hole passing through the ergoregion would not be able to perform the Penrose process, but we can imagine a binary black hole pair that is ripped apart by tidal forces and then presumably the remaining hole would be ejected with a lot of energy. So, yes, we could get fast small black holes this way. In practice this system would lose a lot of energy through gravitational waves, making it likely that the holes would coalesce anyway. The exact limits require numerical relativity simulations to estimate, and this one would be a tough one. (Note that the gravitational waves also carry away energy, up to 1/8 of the total mass of two equal-sized holes merging, but this energy is very hard to capture. Penrose did note in his classic paper that Misner was first in proposing black hole mining using a variant of this.) 

note: as pointed out in the comments below, the third line is at 866.2nm, not 855.2nm - this is suggested to be a typo - the '855' number also shows up on this ESA page. The high resolution spectroscopy only seems to operate between 847 and 874nm, and "three isolated Calcium lines" are used to measure radial velocity. Do all stars have enough calcium in their atmosphere to produce strong enough features to measure the radial velocity so accurately? I had thought that there are some stellar populations have very little besides hydrogen and helium in their atmosphere. Are these always emission lines or absorption lines, or will there be some stars with one and some of the other? What fraction of stars simply won't have significant amounts of calcium? 

In December 2017 LORRI captured the images below of two Kuiper belt objects. From the February 9, 2018 NASA News item New Horizons Captures Record-Breaking Images in the Kuiper Belt: 

From the linked question: People have fanned out over South America and South Africa with telescopes with cameras and GPS clocks and have attempted to watch the shadow of a roughly magnitude +13 star cast by a rock in the KUIPER BELT pass over the Earth! Early Twitter reports reported clear skies and images of the Omega Centauri star cluster. There is a Twitter hash tag for these events, #mu69occ. Here is a 500 millisecond exposure from a few days before the occultation. The short exposure time is necessary to resolve small scale debris from the main occultation. 

Below is a small GIF made from a small subset of images contained in the original 36MB GIF found at $URL$ as I just found in the Sky and Telescope article Asteroid Florence Has Two Moons. Although it's tempting to interpret the image as an optical image, I belive this is pulsed-doppler data from the Goldstone Deep Space Network center. I am guessing that one axis is range (delay) and the other is doppler shift. Still I can't figure out the geometry that would produce an "eclipse" (in this case the moon passing behind the larger asteroid) with it disappearing so "far" from the asteroid. Could someone help me out here? Is one axis delay (time) and the other doppler shift? One can start with this description but there is more to it than is discussed there. below: "A radar image shows asteroid 3122 Florence and tiny echoes from its two moons. Here is an animation that shows them more clearly. The direction of the radar illumination (and thus the direction toward Earth) is at the top." From here. NASA / Jet Propulsion Laboratory. This is a small subset of the frames contained in the original 36 MB GIF, and the size has been decreased by a factor of 2 in order to fit in SE's 2 MB limit.
