Steven Drennon asked an intriguing question - one I've been trying to research myself. Of course, it's difficult because of the mountain of propaganda Gaddafi has been buried under. I can't offer a definitive answer, but I can help fill in some of the blanks. First, under Gaddafi Libya boasted the highest or second highest standard of living among African nations. That fact alone speaks volumes. Ironically, I was able to verify that claim via the CIA World Factbook. Of course, Libya's quality of life probably doesn't look so good in the current edition of the CIA World Factbook. It's also worth noting that people from other African nations flocked to Libya in search of jobs and a better life. I remember reading the most ironic propaganda piece - the author dutifully denounced Gaddafi as a tyrant before reporting on the ripple effect of Libya's destruction: people from neighboring nations could no longer seek jobs or better living conditions in Libya. There was reportedly little overt racism in Libya under Gaddafi, though the CIA-backed rebels were widely accused of murdering black people. Libya under Gaddafi certainly wasn't the hell hole many Western "journalists" described it as. German model Vanessa Hessler, who dated one of Gaddafi's sons, described the family as "normal people." She was fired for not toeing the party line. 

Certain targets were ruled out for various reasons. The Emperor's Palace in Tokyo was ruled out for having essentially no strategic value (despite having high psychological value). Kyoto was ruled out at the request of the Secretary of War, Henry L. Stimson. This produced a final list of five targets: Kokura, Hiroshima, Yokohama, Niigata, and Nagasaki (as a substitute for Kyoto). The final choice of Hiroshima was for entirely mundane reasons: on August 6, it was expected to have the best weather of the five targets. 

Historically, there weren't multiple Portuguese colonies in South America. There was just one. The Portuguese governed Brazil as a single unit since 1549, when the failed Captaincies were merged. This became the Viceroyalty of Brazil (1775), the Kingdom of Brazil (1815, still ruled by the Portuguese Crown), the independent Empire of Brazil (1822, when Pedro I rebelled against his father, the King of Portugal), and finally the current republic (1889). In contrast, the Spanish colonies were governed as multiple independent areas. 

Although the two formations look similar, the pike square was developed in a very different tactical environment than the phalanx. The phalanx and the maniple were developed in an environment where the primary weapons were swords, spears, and occasionally slings. Cavalry was rare, and was typically light cavalry used as skirmishers or to protect an army's flanks. Infantry was the supreme fighting force, and the maniple and phalanx were both developed as a counter to infantry. The phalanx and the maniple were both employed offensively: to push against the enemy's formation and break it. The Renaissance, on the other hand, was the tail end of a period when heavy cavalry was the dominant force. Ranged weapons such as bows, cannon, and early handheld firearms were common, and infantry were considered a "yes, we've also got some of them" force by many commanders. Tactically, the job of a pike square is to provide a defensive formation: to keep enemy cavalry away from your artillery and to keep enemy cavalry and infantry away from your arquebusiers (see: pike and shot). The job of breaking the enemy formation was given to the other elements of the army. 

As others have mentioned, early peoples could have "borrowed" fire from natural fires, typically caused by lightning strikes. However, a more dependable source of fire was provided by simple tools. Rubbing two sticks together to produce heat that eventually ignites dry tinder is a common technique taught in survival classes even today. Flint is also a well known fire starter.

Before NATO invaded Libya, the media were trying to generate hatred for Colonel Gaddafi. One night while sitting in a WiFi cafe, I saw something on the news that got my attention. It was claimed that Gaddafi ordered some of his pilots burned alive after they refused his orders to bomb rebels. My question is simple: Can you offer any details, particularly the date of the broadcast and the name of the channel or news affiliate that broadcast it? A similar lie alleging that Iraqi troops removed babies from incubators was circulated before the invasion of Iraq. It is well documented by many sources online. However, a Google search doesn't reveal a single clear source that discusses the story about the Libya pilots who were allegedly burned alive. The story was broadcast on national TV, then fell off the map. It's possible that this story is buried among the thousands of Google hits you get when typing in general terms like Libya + pilots + "burned alive." However, I've had no luck so far. Anyway, do you know of any references to this story? If not, do you remember seeing this on the news? If so, would you remember any details, such as the approximate date or channel? 

First of all, you should have detailed what did you mean with the term "modern era". If this is related only to the post 1991 period, then there are numerous examples. Here is a list of some of such examples: 

When Potemkin replied that this was out of the ambassador's competence to decide whether to transfer a message from the Soviet government to the Polish one, Grzybowski said that the note should have been delivered via the Soviet embassy in Warsaw, Potemkin responded that there already had been no Soviet ambassador there. Then Grzybowski admitted, that he didn't have communication with the government but kept stating that the government was still in Poland and fully functional. After Potemkin's offer to use Soviet communication channels to deliver the note, the Polish ambassador responded that this (the suggested use of the Soviet channels or assistance) would have been repugnant to "the dignity of the Polish government". Long story short, Potemkin and Molotov were forced to sent a courier to the Polish embassy and to give the note to someone there (probably a doorkeeper) in return for a receipt before the Polish ambassador left Potemkin, lest he forbids the doorkeeper to sign the receipt. Please note, that this story was taken from a book published by the International Democracy Fund, which had (the fund ceased activity just a couple of weeks ago) a strong affiliation with various Soros and the US government financed entities, so it would be hard to dismiss that as a "communist/Russian propaganda".
