I can only offer fragmentary facts I have read but cannot cite sources. I was told by university lecturer years ago that there survives an Ancient Greek 'history of philosophers' that mentions one philosopher of that time of whom the most interesting thing to be said about him was that he owned the complete works of Plato, indicating that this was very unusual even for philosophers. A lot of the time people learned more by 'talking to someone who had talked to Socrates'. In Latin (hence not strictly Greek, but Greco-Roman culture was closely intertwined) there is a word 'librarius' which can be translated 'bookseller', although I have read that the librarius's profession involved copying out the books as well as selling them. This suggests there were businesses that specialised in disseminating books for profit, although as other have said, there was no copyright law so authors did not have the same kind of connection to them that modern authors do to their publishers. There was also a custom among educated Romans that if they wrote a book they invited people they knew to attend a reading of it. The Roman historian Tacitus tried to end each chapter with an epigram, apparently to signal to the audience at the reading when to applaud. Other Roman writers complained about how boring the reading of a book by its author could be. One Roman money lender whose hobby was writing histories was said to be notorious for compelling those unfortunate enough to be in debt to him to attend his readings of his histories. 

This is 63 cents/day. The RDEU was considered NOT appropriate for long time use, since it was nutritionally insufficient. The WPA set these guidelines to attempt to help families budget as economically as possible. The figure of $1,260.62 was set as the minimum for a family of "small means" to purchases only proper food housing and clothing, but not cars, tractors, better housing or save for their children's education. National Income Distribution and Poverty Rates According to Michael B. Katz and Mark J. Stern in Poverty in Twentieth-Century America, through the usage of a reconstruction of early poverty data proposals, the level is lower: 

Abolishing serfdom is important for creating a middle class. An very early and well developed legal system protecting personal and property rights First European Nation State Henry VII wins the War of the Roses in England, begins the Tudor dynasty in 1485. Financial innovation The UK did not invent many of these things, but its strong legal system allowed them to flourish, such as contracts, equity, mortgages, joint stock and limited liability. Private companies were able to use joint stock with the permission of the monarchy to finance trade and settlements in British colonies. An example is the British East India Company.

Magellan's wife and children weren't hostages for use as insurance or blackmail. The King of Portugal was attempting to kill Magellan. He destroyed the family castle in Portugal, sent assassins after Magellan and even sent ships after the fleet to stop the voyage. The location of Magellan's wife, Beatriz Barbosa, during the voyage is not clear from the couple's correspondence but it seems most likely to be with her father at their family home, not at court under the watchful eye of the Spanish king. Her father, Diego Barbosa frequented the king's court, so of course it seems possible that her father was helping to keep an eye on her safety and that of their young son for the king. 

There are usually some people who get a feeling of superiority from taking the cynical line, so in this case someone may well say "Of course all the talk of justice, patriotism, standing up to aggressors etc. was phony, it was really all about control of Antarctica's untapped oil reserves." However, while that might be about 1% of it so far as the UK and Argentine governments were concerned, I doubt it was important as: -Wikipedia will confirm that the argument over the Falklands goes back to the eighteenth century. Britain. Spain and France all had claims to them, which Spain asserted by force in the 1770s and Britain reversed, again by force, in the 1830s. Thereafter Spain's successor Argentina kept up a theoretical claim but probably did not dare to start a war over them while Britain was a much the stronger world power in the Nineteenth and early to mid Twentieth Century. For most of this period no one knew or cared whether there was oil or other minerals buried inaccessibly under Antartica. The argument was genuinely about the islands themselves. -In the 34 years since the Falklands War neither Britain nor Argentina has seriously attempted to exploit its Antarctic territory commercially, suggesting that any hope of being able to do so was a very remote one and hardly worth the risk of a war on either side. It proved a disastrous gamble to the then military Junta ruling Argentina, who brought about their own disgrace and downfall by starting and then losing the war. I was later told by someone in our Ministry of Defence that at the beginning they did not really think Britain could succeed in recapturing the islands, yet the Thatcher government took the risk, knowing it must be their political ruin if they lost. Surely neither government would have gambled their existence over the very distant prospect of possibly one day being able to get something of value out of Antarctica. -I am British and was aged 18 or 19 at the time Argentina invaded with very little warning and temporarily seized the Falklands by surprise. Most people subsequently followed the news of the dispatch of a British naval and military task force to the South Atlantic and their eventual victory. The War did divide people, but most in Britain who I spoke to who supported the war did so because they saw it as standing up to aggression and/or hurt national pride. I remember trying to explain to a puzzled New Zealander why we had fought for remote islands that previously most people in Britain had scarcely known existed. I said he would probably understand why many of us were angry at the surprise Argentinian invasion if he ever woke up to learn that a foreign country had seized by force some equally obscure islands far out in the Pacific over which New Zealand claimed sovereignty. Whereas the people I encountered in Britain who opposed fighting to recover the Falklands seemed to be of two types: the type of committed 'leftie' to whom their own country is automatically always in the wrong, plus at least some of those old enough to have lived through the World Wars and remember what is was like when their own family or families they knew lost people killed. What I do not remember is anyone caring much about the Antarctic territories. 

Enclosure is one of the causes of the British Agricultural Revolution, but it causes mass unemployment. The unemployed people often sought work for low wages in the Industrializing Northern England. British Agricultural Revolution 

(Note: "Collapse" should be taken to mean a loss of complexity. "Dissolve" means an increase of complexity. My definitions don't make great sense, but I feel we need some) The number one reason states collapse or peacefully dissolve and are added to other states, including military reasons is: The inability to adapt and react to change, or more commonly known as Gross Ineptitude, Mismanagement and Political Corruption There are many theories concerning how and why this occurs. First the WHY This is not the best source, I apologize, but the conclusions we can draw from it will be pretty much the same. 

In Greece, Mesopotamia, Carthage, Egypt, Rome, slaves were widely traded and used in a chattel slavery system for economic purposes. The slaves did not typically have rights and could be very poorly treated or even killed. Highly skilled slaves were treated better and more likely to earn their freedom, because threats of violence alone cannot make someone be a good business manager, trader, artisan or craftsman. Slavery was very profitable, but it was not economically efficient. This seems a bit paradoxical. EDIT-this had a confusing error equating slaves and serfs: Slavery is the most efficient if you use a manorial form of agriculture, even though it is less efficient than free labor farming on small farms. (Meaning that tenant farmers and serfs, as not technically slaves, are less efficient than slaves. In other words, people must own their land and own what they produce to be productive or they are disincentivized. Slaves are made to be productive through violence, which can't be used on a serf.) The proof for this idea comes from the numerous emancipations of serfs or slaves throughout history. Agricultural production will fall by nearly half in the first few years as a result of the upheaval but will soon recover and greatly overtake the past production levels if land ownership is implemented. In civilizations where land is the measure of wealth, there is a tendency for the wealthy to buy up all the land. Rome for example divided its official class structures by the amount of land someone owned. When Rome started winning many wars, there was a greater and greater gap between rich and poor, and the rich were able to establish a plantation system (latifundia referred to in the other answer). So, therefore, even before industrialization, slavery is less efficient. It's more of a status symbol for the elite to make it just efficient enough for them to have plantations. Debt slavery is also economically inefficient. In the American colonies, the consistently poor were sold into slavery to the lowest bidder for short periods of time, a year to five years, prior to the invention of poor houses. There was limited charity and government aid, but some people needed long term assistance. It was a consistent problem that these slaves would not be able to bring enough income for the master and thus were often very poorly treated, not given enough food and basic clothing. The intention was to improve the lot of the poor person who was likely begging for food in the street, but the system obviously failed. It makes a bit of sense that those who are poor have low earning potential, since many would be elderly or suffer from disabilities. For what its worth, the Romans actually did ban debt slavery. Broadly allowing it probably has really negative economic effects, such as increasing parasitic lending practices and bad business investments. 

Don't know if Al Qaeda was conscious of it or not, but 11 September 1683 was the all-time high water mark of the advance of Muslim armies into Christendom, when the Ottoman Turks stood outside the walls of Vienna. They were defeated and driven back the following day, 12 September 1683. I also don't know if it is significant that 12 September is of course a date in the Western, Christian calendar. Muslims do use it for convenience for secular purposes. However, they have their own lunar month based calendar used to determine date of Ramadan etc., in which year 1 is the year Mohammed moved to Medina (where he established the first Muslim government). 

Size of population. Egypt (and China) have had long-running linguistic continuity, despite periodic invasions by outsiders, as their fertile river valleys have long sustained such dense populations that an incoming minority of foreign conquerors was more likely to be absorbed into the much larger native population, and eventually adopt their language, than vice versa. It is easier for a population to adopt a language related in grammar, sounds and vocabulary to the one they previously spoke than a completely different one e.g. Latin could be relatively easily adopted by Gaulish Celtic speakers because they are related Indo-European languages. Ditto Semitic Arabic by Coptic Egyptians whose language while not technically Semitic was related to it, both, together with some other languages such as Berber, being part of what is called the Afro-Asiatic family of languages. 

Shaving was hard before the invention of metal knives. I regret I do not now recall the name of the book but I read in one book about Ancient Egypt, which had pictures to prove it, that in very early times, I think before 3,000 BC, when pre-literate Ancient Egyptians scratched or coloured pictures, as they sometimes did, they showed their men, who were not naturally as hairy as other races, with unimpressive small beards, which are probably all that grew naturally for them. From the Bronze Age, which roughly coincided with the appearance of literacy, Egyptian men were portrayed clean shaven. Men of some foreign nations, often also distinguished by their style of dress and other features, may be shown with beards, sometimes probably to conform to a stereotype to identify the picture as being of a Syrian or whatever. It seems the Ancient Egyptians therefore adopted shaving around 5,000 years ago, almost as soon as it was easily possible once they had sharp enough metal implements. Thereafter, they stayed clean-shaven pretty well as long as their civilization lasted, so for the next 3 thousand years. That would be remarkable for other societies but less so for the Ancient Egyptians, who once they found a style that suited them tended to stay with it for an amazingly long time. A sketch survives from Deir el-Medina, the village of the workers on the royal tombs in the Valley of the Kings in the New Kingdom (c 1550 - 1080 BC), probably made by one of the workmen in his spare time, of a man wearing the an Egyptian Royal Crown, looking slightly overdue for a shave, with bristles ('five O'clock shadow' we may now call it) showing on his chin and cheeks. In other words one of the workmen was probably being slightly naughty in showing the King caught not looking at his best, and differently from the formal and invariably respectful portraits that the painters and sculptors of the Royal tombs had to produce in their day-jobs. 

I have a case of an 18th century white man referring to his nationality as native American, meaning he was born in America. This is on his census form. Was this usage common? For clarity: I'm asking because I was able to uncover a lot of material that seems to suggest that the usage became quite common later in the 19th century, although this seems unusual to me for the 18th century. I am interested obviously how a term with a long history of usage by white Americans could be transferred to American Indians, that's not part of this of question. 

One example is the Russian population in Kazakhstan. (The USSR transferred large populations around, so this is probably not the only example.) Settlement started in the 19th century, but increased in the 20th century. According to Wikipedia, by 1917, 30% of the population was Russian. 

One reason that is often cited is the system of indirect rule used by the British. In the American colonies, the colonist were first of all, mostly from the UK. Americans have many similarities to the British even today, but there are cultural differences too. The American colonists were mostly allowed self-rule as long as they paid taxes to the king and traded only within the British Empire. (The economic system was mercantilism, so these trade arrangements with the British were exploitative.) The laws put in place in the US were thus appropriate to the needs and will of its people. In Ghana, or the "British Gold Coast," most people were native and only a few British people lived there to administer the colony. These administrators wrote the laws of Ghana and put them in place. The British appointed leaders for the people. These weren't the best leaders for the people, but who were the easiest for the British to manipulate. In many instances, the British are known for bribing tribal leaders to make indirect rule more effective and more peaceful. This most likely occurred in Ghana and contributed to problems of corruption after independence. 

I apologise this is nothing like a full answer. However 'The Periplus of the Erythrean Sea'[which roughly means, the Indian Ocean] written in ancient Greek but during Roman times, most likely 1st Century AD, translation available by internet search, is a practical account of trading ports and routes known to Greco-Roman merchants, what was bought and sold there, dangers en route etc. This contains quite a lot of information about trading to India and a little about Burma, but says no ships are known to have sailed further. It mentions 'a city called Thina' somewhere further inland from which silk is brought by traders. This is probably a garbled reference to China. The Romans did have silk as a luxury good, so must have had indirect trade with China as the only producer at that time, through 'middlemen'or a series of middlemen. However, the Romans were often in conflict with the Parthians and Persians, whose empires tended to be in the way of direct land travel from the Mediterranean area to China. I am sure I have read of other, clearer references to China by ancient Greek or Roman authors, but do not recall which ones. My recollection is that they knew it was there and was a large, civilized country, but had little other hard information. 

You could call it a 'large scale protest' that following the Presidential election held on 6 November 1860, I assume once the votes were counted and reported by telegraph it was known by 7 or 8 November that Abraham Lincoln had won, the state legislature of South Carolina voted on 9 November to declare Lincoln's election a hostile act and its intention to secede from the Union, hence the Confederacy and Civil War. 

Urban renewal projects defined by Wikipedia as "a program of land redevelopment in areas of moderate to high density urban land use" started in the 19th century with two very different rationales. In London, they were motivated by a concern for public health and in Paris, they were motivated by a concern for the aesthetics of the city. Today it seems that urban renewal projects can have many disparate motivations, although all share a post-modern and capitalist logic in my opinion: road construction, removing urban blight, increasing tourism, historical preservation, promoting mixed development and more efficient use of city spaces, promoting ethnic integration, increasing the tax base or economic development, etc. (Feel free to argue that this makes no sense. I'm not sure it has any "logic") I would like to know if the historical development of urban renewal has been roughly similar internationally in the 20th century or if in some parts of the world it has been commonly used for different reasons in some places than in other places? If it has been different, what might be the reasons? I am wondering if the reasons might be to address more practical concerns or if they are more commonly due to the cultural differences, the differences in popularity of art movements or ideology (ideology-fascism, capitalism, communism- can strongly influence art and building choice). 

Korea was also an important power but it was subjected to constant invasion and wars with the Mongols, China and Japan. It also had a policy of isolationism.
