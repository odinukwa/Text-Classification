tl;dr That's a really good question, and even just a few years ago we didn't really have anything approaching a conclusive answer. However, an analysis of mitochondrial DNA extracted from human remains recovered from the Xiaohe cemetery was published in 2015, and we now know that the answer is complicated, but that most of the early populations probably arrived from the steppes of southern Siberia at some point in the early Bronze Age, rather than as European settlers travelling the Silk Roads to China. 

The reason I mention this is that the article includes links to the datasets used (i.e. the lists of names of people in those groups) on GitHub, which might be of use to you in your research. 

The main source for information about the death of Herod the Great is the historian Flavius Josephus, who was writing more than a generation after the death of Herod. Josephus states that Herod's death occurred between by “a fast” and the Passover. He also says that on the night of the fast there was a lunar eclipse. Now, there were four lunar eclipses that occurred in the likely time frame: 

is, perhaps, a step too far. It's worth noting that the article you mentioned is from a politics site, rather than a history site, although the author is herself an historian. 

Most people who worked the land in medieval England lived in village communities. These medieval villages were associated with a particular Manor, and a manor could occasionally have more than one village in it. A number of these villages have been excavated, and we have particularly good evidence from a number of deserted medieval villages where the sites have not been damaged by later development. In fact, as a result of the knowledge accumulated from years of archaeological excavations, we can now not only say something about the development of the homes in these villages, but even about the furnishings that they contained. In 15th Century England (as with most of the medieval period), most people who worked the land were serfs of some degree (i.e villeins, smallholders, or cottagers), but as a result of depopulation in the 14th century (largely as a result of the Black Death) land was beginning to be worked by free men (due to the shortages of workers, people were able to demand greater rights to the land they worked). People of all these groups seem to have lived together in the villages, and the evidence (for example from Wythemail in Northamptonshire) increasingly suggests that they lived in relatively spacious, well-built, multi-roomed houses. Whether you could leave the land and head to the city depended on your status. villeins were tied to the land, and could not leave. However, the status of "villein" was changing through the course of the 15th century, and by about 1500 it had effectively died out in England. Smallholders and cottagers had greater freedom of movement. 

That's a really good question. As far as I know, there isn't yet a definitive answer, although I haven't kept fully up to date with the subject in recent years.. In Care and Conservation of Manuscripts: Proceedings of the First International Seminar on the Care and Conservation of Manuscripts Held at the University of Copenhagen 25th-26th April 1994, Ogmundur Helgason observed that: 

The Conquest of Normandy ================================= The conquest of Normany that you referred to in the question actually happened under Richard's successor, King John. John has a good claim to the title of England's worst ever king (and there's some stiff competition!). Philip captured much of Normandy in the campaigns of 1202-1204. As with so much else in his life, John was not up to the task of defending Normandy. He was even less successful in his later attempts to retake the Duchy. The loss of Normandy effectively broke the Angevin Empire which had been Philip's goal from the start. John's failure earned him the nickname "John Lackland". 

Presumably, in this case, New Granada referred to the former Republic of New Granada. I'm always cautious about uncorroborated newspaper accounts, but if the New York Times correspondent was correct in his belief, then Peter Smith continued to practice as a doctor in New Granada (which by that point was known as the Granadine Confederation) until at least 1860. 

This was the action for which Goodman was awarded the Victoria Cross (hence the link to the London Gazette from the Wikipedia page). Lastly, it's worth mentioning that the incident was reported - with varying degrees of detail - in a number of contemporary British newspapers. One example was the Illustrated London News of Saturday 20 January 1855: 

Now, the increase in longevity is by far the greatest in the early modern humans of the Upper Palaeolithic. At this point in human development, there are a more older adults than younger adults in the death distribution for the first time. Obviously, this is significant in terms of human development. But the study didn't examine Neolithic samples. 

Lictors were Roman civil servants. They were recruited from the ranks of the Roman Plebeian class. Livy described them in the following terms: 

But despite all the above examples, the "large scale counter-intelligence-turned witch hunt" you describe in the question seems to be very much the exception rather than the rule. If we look further back in history, in 17th century England only one torture warrant seems to have been issued in the years leading up to the English Civil War, and none during it [Thomas & Leo, 2012, p31]. Other than that, there was just the Witchfinder General, Matthew Hopkins - which was an actual "witch hunt" rather than a war. I did an online search looking for examples of torture being used to extract "confessions" to implicate innocents during the American Civil War and the American War of Independence, but couldn't find any examples at all. Obviously, it is probably impossible to prove that it never happened, but it certainly seems it wasn't carried out on a large scale. Torture was certainly used in France during the Reign of Terror but, for the most part, that wasn't during a war, and so would seem to fall outside your criteria. 

Even with the high resolution image, the detail of the hieroglyphs is difficult to make out on a mobile phone screen, so transliteration & translation is probably out of the question from me for now (not to mention the time involved). I know that translations were published by Alan Gardiner (probably through the Egypt Exploration Society). They may also have been included in Breasted's Ancient Records of Egypt, and possibly even now be available online. However, I did a quick Google search, and found that the hieroglyphs have been transcribed, transliterated and translated into French on the abydossethy.net website. (A brief review of their site suggests that they have done this with most, if not all, of the surviving texts from the Temple of Seti at Abydos). 

That gives a total of just under 8000 statues. The army was completed in about 11 years (construction of the mausoleum took longer), so they were producing, on average, about 700 sculptures a year. 

Lincoln's brother-in-law also notified the chairman of the Illinois State Whig Executive Committee, A.G. Henry, about Lincoln's decision. Henryy wrote to Secretary Ewing on 24 September 1849. He said that Lincoln: 

Personally, I suspect that Silbury Hill may provide an insight into the question of why other large-scale prehistoric monuments were built. At the beginning of the Bronze Age most of the population was involved in some form of agricultural work for most of the year. However, at certain times of the agricultural year there is less to do than there is at others. We can infer from residue analysis that they had alcoholic beverages. It seems reasonable to conclude that, then as now, the combination of young people with time on their hands and easy access to alcohol is likely to lead to social problems. At the same time, there is the natural desire (which we have already seen with the Neolithic long barrows) to place a mark on the landscape. Something that says: "This is our place. And we are here for the long term". Given these drivers, it is possible to see many of the early large-scale monuments as communal projects, intended to set their stamp on the landscape, while also ensuring that idle hands were occupied. Some "authority", whether that was an individual "leader", or a group of "elders", or a group of wives desperate to get their husbands out of the way, or something else entirely, decided that they should build Long-barrows; causewayed-enclosures; henges; stone circles ... Silbury Hill may just have been the largest of these projects where, perhaps, the journey was just as important as the destination. Although that interpretation is consistent with the evidence, it remains just one possible interpretation. However, it is one that I find persuasive. 

Studies of early population movements have also been carried for Wales and Scotland. These have revealed similar patterns of migration to those seen in England. The 1536 'Act of Union' between England and Wales effectively made Wales a region of England. This seems to have had the effect of making migration easier for people living in Wales. There is even evidence of relatively large-scale migration from Wales to Scotland in the period immediately after the 1536 Act [Williams, 1987]. Evidence for the Scottish highlands is, unfortunately, relatively scant. However, a number of studies (for example, [Houston, 1985], [Jones, 1986]; and [Whyte, 1997]) have demonstrated significant levels of mobility in lowland Scotland in the pre-industrial period. The sources that I've listed below are by no means meant to be exhaustive, but they should give a good flavour of what we know about pre-industrial migration patterns in England, Scotland and Wales. 

Many of the excesses of the Albigensian Crusade are well known. For example, the massacre at Béziers, where the Cistercian Abbot and Papal Legate Arnaud Amalric allegedly told his men: 

The Third Crusade ========================== The Third Crusade was a response to Saladin's capture of Jerusalem. King Henry II of England and King Philip II of France ended their endemic conflict with each other in early 1189 in order to jointly lead a new crusade to the Holy Land with the goal of recapturing Jerusalem. Henry II died on 6 July 1189, and the command of the English contingent passed to his successor Richard I. As part of the peace settlement between England and France, it had been agreed that Richard would marry Philip’s sister Alice (or Alys) on his return from the coming crusade. In late 1190, both kings had arrived on Sicily, en-route for the Holy Land. Relations between the two men were always fractious, and the situation was not improved when, early in 1191, Richard broke off his long-standing betrothal to Alice and announced that he would marry Berengaria of Navarre. Richard made matters worse by claiming that Alice had been Henry II's mistress, and that she had borne him an illegitimate son. To safeguard the progress of the crusade (or, at least, to ensure that he could not be blamed for its failure), Philip agreed to accept a 10,000 mark payment from Richard in lieu of Alice's dowry. This dowry had included the lands of Vexin, and the strategic fortress at Gisors. I believe that this is probably the agreement between Philip and Richard that you referred to in the question. The crusade itself didn't go particularly well for Philip. He contracted dysentery during the siege of Acre which seriously compromised his health. He failed to achieve the military glory which he had sought, as his exploits during the siege were easily outshone by those of King Richard. He also lost a key ally in the person of Philip, Count of Flanders, who had died during the siege. This last was also politically significant since it threatened to undermine the Treaty of Gisors, and Philip used this as a reason/excuse to return to France in order to settle the succession in Flanders. Obviously, this meant breaking the vow that he had taken when he took up the cross, and Richard was characteristically blunt about it: 

I'm not sure that it is possible at this distance to say with absolute certainty what the members of "Murder, Inc." called themselves - if, indeed, they had any internal name at all. It may very well be that the sources simply do not exist. However, given that caveat, we can certainly say something about how "Murder, Inc." was known to different groups, in particular to journalists and to members of US law-enforcement, and what those groups believed the members of "Murder, Inc." called themselves. We also have some reports from witnesses and informants who stated that the group was known to them as "the Combination". 

One of the things that set the Pisonian conspiracy apart from the plots and conspiracies that preceded it in the reigns of earlier emperors was its scale. Our most complete account of the conspiracy comes from Tacitus (Annals, Book XV). We know that there were at least 41 people involved in the Pisonian Conspiracy. There may well have been many others, but according to Cassius Dio, Tigellinus allowed others to go free in return for substantial bribes: 

Getting accurate numbers is going to be problematic. Firstly, as you might expect, not all the records have survived. Secondly, a large number of those who were killed were never recorded in the official records of the Inquisition in the first place. It should be made clear from the outset that claims of tens of millions of deaths as a result of the Inquisition - even over a period of several centuries - is simply mathematically untenable. For example, Spain had a population of about 7.5 million at the height of the Spanish Inquisition in the sixteenth century [Elliott, 1989, p223]. To place those numbers into further context, the Black Death killed an estimated 20 million people in Europe, or just under half the population, in the period from 1348 to 1352. 

We know that Richard was a warrior who genuinely loved to fight. Perhaps more importantly, he was also very good at it. He was an excellent general and he was courageous, frequently defeating much larger forces with relatively small bands of knights. He shared the hardships of his troops on campaign and led from the front in battle. But he lived in a time and place, in which these were all considered to be desirable qualities in a king. He was also noted for his piety, reported to be generous, and the evidence suggests that he was also merciful. We've seen evidence of this mercy in his treatment of William Marshal, but we also see it in how he dealt with his brother John after his treachery. Oh, and, according to the chronicles, he also apparently loved poetry and music (he supposedly wrote a poem called “No man who is imprisoned” which still survives).
