If you can afford gears, buy them. Having an uphill section at the end you will want to shift up in order to make it easier. Going the oposite direction you will also like the ability to go to a smaller gear to get a little more speed downhill. Looking at the pictures linked, it seemed the that the single speed have a rather small rear cog compared to the geared bike. If you can't handle shifting rapidly you can always leave it your geared bike in one speed, but at least you'll have the option of chaing it for those morning where you feel weaker or have less energy. 

I think you are confused between tubular and tubeless. Tubular tires are "all in one" tire where the inner tube is sewed inside the tire. Tubeless tires look like regular clincher tire and hooks in specially designed rims; these tubeless tire and rim provide an airtight seal so they can be inflated without an inner tube. Regular clincher tires are very similar, but require an inner tube to contain the air. So a tubeless tire does require a hooked rim, but they are not tubular tires. Additional detail : clincher tires can be installed in tubeless rims with no problems. 

I don't think they are related and I don't think clip-less pedal will change anything. It's probably age or lack of running training that make it harder to run. Anecdotal evidence : my friend is running and cycling pretty fast, but I can only cycle fast, I'm an abysmal runner. He runs multiple times a week while I rarely run more than once a month. Think of triathletes who run and cycle pretty fast, if cycling would be bad for running, they wouldn't be able to do both of them at that level. 

Yes Of course it's possible, you just need to find a telescopic seat post on the market that is longer than the one you have. Your measurement of your post might be a bit off though, I'm guessing that from your 28.x measurement, and the fact that I don't think 34.2mm is a seatpost size... not one that I'm familiar with anyways. In which case chances are your post is a 34.9mm, not a 34.2mm, and that something like this will do the trick: 34.9mm EXTRA LONG EXTENDABLE SEAT POST 530mm-730mm(21"-28") TELESCOPIC ALLOY 

My first suspicion would be the alignment on the wheels, if they are not properly aligned then they will wear, but I'm not certain what you can do to adjust the alignment on that trailer. Check the dish of the rims and also make sure that they are true, this may affect how the alignment and how the wheels roll and wear. If the tires are only wearing on the insides, then rotating them is definitely an option. Swap the tire around on the rims so that the unworn side is on the inside, this may affect how the tires grip the road if they are directional, but you might lengthen their life a bit longer by evenly wearing out the tire. 

I'm always worried about pinching my tubes when installing them, I've done it loads of times, especially when installing really tight tires. You can pinch a tube just enough to get a slow leak, so you're right to wonder if that's a probable cause. It could also be the valve as @Blam suggests, especially if it's a schrader valve tube (same valve type as car tires). Another likely culprit is the rim of the wheel itself. Does the rim have a proper rim tape/rim strip on it? If your rims aren't properly taped, then when you pump your tires up to pressure you can actually puncture the tube on the spokes, or cut the tube on the spoke holes, depending on how many walls your rim has. Check to make sure your tube is protected from the rim. Rim Strip $URL$ Simple Ruber Rim tape/strip 

The big thing is : you have a very subjective human riding the bicycle. Even if a study shows that for X leg length you need Y crank length, if the person riding the bike think that Z cranks feel better or feel faster, what can you do? That is mostly why there is so much debate, because everybody is different. Also people want different things from their bike, some want minimum maintenance, while other want minimum friction. Some people want light wheels, other want stiffer wheels. Some people don't mind lubing the chain after each ride, while other will do it one a season. 

Even if the error is 5%, it's still a power meter. I would get it fixed either to use personnaly or to sell it. 

In almost every slope you will hit a speed "sweet spot" where the gravity pull and drag from the wind will cancel each other out, this can be at 70 km/h for a 8% slope in aero position or 15 km/h for a 2% slope on an hybrid bike. 

All these are hard for a car to keep up, sure you might annoy some pedestrians and might be illegal in some places, but it's still better than having the crap beat out of you. 

Google Maps has a Bicycling overlay that can help you. It does have a few indication that states what type of road you have : 

I fear that you won't be able to replace the wheel with exactly the same thing since they seem to be generic wheels built for this bike. You can try the dealer you bought them from, they might have a replacement available or you can look for a different set elsewhere. In that price category you might have to buy a set (front+rear wheel) thought, but at least that means they will match.

When you stop however, do not stop beside the car at the front to the line, you never want to be in a vehicles blind spot. Pull up just ahead of it and make eye contact with the driver so he knows you're there. If the first car in line is signalling to turn right, then stop just behind them and wait for them to turn in front of you before proceeding to the front of the line. Motorists are supposed to shoulder check when turning right at intersections to check for cyclists, but it's my experience that most motorists don't even know that bikes are allowed to ride on the road, so always drive defensively. 

The answer is NOBODY. Jones is the only manufacturer of the closed loop H-bar. After nearly a year of searching for a cheaper alternative I finally just bit the bullet and ordered the bar from Jones. It would have been better if I had ordered it sooner instead of holding out in hopes of finding an alternative manufacturer, I really got dinged by exchange rates for waiting. 

You're not going to be able to buy just the floor stand without the clamp unless you chance to buy one at a yard sale or on ebay, you might be able to contact Park Tool and ask them if they can send you just the floor stand without the clamp as a replacement part, but I doubt it for that particular stand. My advice would be to just buy the new stand, amazon sells them for $90 less than their listed price. And you can get them for even cheaper than that on ebay. Then you can keep you bench mount for spare parts or just leave it where it is and have two stands. You could try building a floor stand out of chain link fence parts depending on the size of post you need to fit the clamp. The cheapest solution would probably be to buy one post (or borrow one from a local school) and a floor flange, and either bolt it to your garage floor (permanent) or to a big piece of thick plywood (which will eventually break). I don't recommend looking at getting piece of plate steel like the PRS Deluxe stands have, because I've looked into it before and the size plate you's want would cost almost as much as a new PCS stand would. If you can get anything free by chance or from a junker/someone you know then that's a bonus. But like I said, I think you'd be better of just to buy a new stand. 

One big difference is where the force is applied. In a conventional pedal, you press down using the ball of you foot. In a foot-long pedal you would have to center the axle so the pedal stays level, but that would mean that the force would be applied by the middle of your foot. You would be losing the power and flexibility that your ankle can bring. Being clipped in the pedal also has many power and security advantages. Does your footlong pedal in your scenario has a way of being clipped ? In that case you still need strong shoes with a sole, so why have that big of a pedal when you can have a single smaller point of contact ? 

Maybe you can use a shipping service from the US to re-ship the new keys to you, but I'm assuming that you have to send the lock in, and have them ship it back ? If that's the case, a new lock would probably be cheaper. 

It's a little more than 100$, but you could have a Garmin Edge 20 for 130$. Maybe wait a little for a special or something*. According to the post it's a good little computer and I personnaly enjoy using their Edge lineup. (* the website has a 10% anything coupon with their partner, might be worth a look, that would bring the Edge 20 to 117$, might not work for everything thought) 

This means how much energy was delivered to make the wheels turn. As Daniel R Hicks mentioned, calories in that case mean how much "food" energy your body burned, which will always be higher than the energy you give to the wheels. 

So you might check those dedicated lanes. An other option would be to use Strava's Global Heatmap where you can see where people are cycling the most. You can't really see what you want exactly (dedicated lanes), but coupled with Google's map, I find it's a good start to plan a ride. 

When you put a new chain on a worn cog they won't necessarily mesh. The new chain will have some "wiggle room" to slide around in and possibly even slide laterally enough that one of the sharpened teeth can pick up a link, which on a single speed can put enough force on the one side of the link to pop the pin out. My question for you would be, how worn was the cog? If the cog is fine, then how loose was your chain? A loose chain can just as easily jump the teeth and break. 

The first thing you need to recognize is that you literally have less than half of your original stopping power. Riding without a front brake puts excess strain on your rear brake. You are very dependant on your front brake for the majority of your stopping power, especially when trying to stop quickly, as momentum will load your front wheel while decelerating and lift weight off of your rear. Rules for stopping effectively with only a rear rim/disc brake: 

It's easy to determine that you're obviously losing your braking power due to heat generation. But hard to pin down exactly what's wrong without actually looking at your bike. There are a couple of things that could be going on, which could be a result of a mechanical issue, or an operational issue. Mechanical Issue First of all, your m615 brakes are only middle of the line, they aren't intended for extreme downhill (check out the Saint line), but even still, 30 seconds isn't a very long time before failure. There are a number of questions I would ask you in the shop;
