I think you are exactly right, we do have to clarify this for ourselves. Don't we replace all the cells in our body every tens years or so? Maybe not our brain cells. And some cells have a much higher turnaround, the lining of our lungs and digestive tract are constantly being sloughed off and replaced, I think. But we nevertheless carry with us the feeling of mental and physical continuity. The individual qua individual can't find a "me" or an "I". We have to credit Hegel with this insight. The self-definition of the self as self comes when we encounter the other, and the object in general. We have to come against limits to begin to define ourselves. Then the question is whether the "Bildungsroman" of lived life is enough. This Bildungsroman-process is our education, and the hard knocks we take in life, the education of Spirit/Mind. But in addition to this it seems we have to cast ourselves forward, we need an intention toward the future to maintain the "me"; this we see really in Nietzsche, and the Heidegger of Being and Time, and in Sartre too. The background here is Schopenhauer, and maybe Kierkegaard too, I am no so familiar with Kierkegaard. But it's complicated in that we tend to fool ourselves into thinking we are unique when in fact we are not. We are captured by the "They", Heidegger, or by our instincts, Freud, everything we think WE are is merely the product of total mediation (Frankfurt School) It's not really our thought, it's something we heard on the news or some such. When we say "me" or "I" this is a self-reification. And as Adorno said, in all reifications there is a forgetting. We tend to forget not only the history of our life and education, but the totality of the world that is wrapped up into us. It is sadly possible to see ourselves today merely as a reified object for sale on some market, the job market or the love and sex market. The human in us is crushed down into an object to be marketed, and ultimately to be thrown away. This sort of alienation away from the fullness of Being is kind of ceasing to be. So now we are lost again, where is the "me"? The existentialists are probably right that we can (we must), in an atomized world, for our own mental health, and even if it is a fiction, transcend the in-itself by some projection forward (goals, whatever). Even if it is a fiction, we hold ourselves together and organize ourselves by being in and for "ourselves". The loss of self-organization, or the loss of the necessary fiction of the organized self or me, would be the ceasing to be, or psychosis. It's not so much the physical body, since we discharge and replace the physical body all the time. The end of the self-narrative projected forward would be the ceasing to be. P.S. The problem today is that the pressure for the narrative is all on us. Society and religion used to provide "the" story, now under postmodernism and in a porous world, we have too many stories, and life is short. The need for the personal story would be less if there could be "our" story, but this would require a less atomized world. We can hope that existentialism is only a solution for this present time in our history. 

Yes, power on one axis/being would simply be distributed in time on the other. Given that they are eternal as well as infinite, the more likely scenario is that they're wise enough to negotiate the boundaries are. Since there is a documented story of one such infinite being gaving rise to another being, that is the likely trajectory of Man if and when He/She completes their journey of Knowledge. 

WE ARE DIFFERENT. We are not only governed by the laws of physics, for when we act with awareness, we have personal agency. No psychologist or neuroscientist has pinned down the origin or seat of consciousness. The simplest conclusion is that it transcends (strict) observability because it is the subject itself being observed and this forms a contradiction. I really wanted to answer this with my robot voice. EXTERMINATE. 

The issue is that "rational" implies the constructs of reason, while "logical" implies sound premises as well. A Christian is rational to believe that Jesus will save them if they believe in him, but they are illogical in that no one told them they needed to be saved in the first place. 

Generally and in most practical usages I've come across, it means that a particular kind of (generally unstated) "science", namely, empricism, can't answer (because they rely on something subjective or "on faith"). This is the problem with both religion and science: they both favor their own methods and cannot or do not breach into each other`s domains. 

Austria (Vienna) to me is the classic case study here. One of the characters of great interest, Karl Lueger. This man knew how to get elected. He knew how to appeal to the petit bourgeoisie. There is very little new under the sun. It's just amazing how this one city in the late 19th Century, early 20th century continues to have its influence on the world. The number of imporant figures who passed through Vienna before , and in the early years after, WWI is astounding. Lenin was there. Hitler. They all got an education of sorts in Vienna. But this is just the tip of the iceberg of the figures who passed through. Even today I watch Austria for trends, because it is small, and it can change quickly. What I think we have here is a limitation of consciousness. A circle is drawn, permissible news is inside the circle, and many times a busy public has no idea what is outside the circle, unless they put in an effort. When we speak of the press and propaganda, usually I think of a central authority which can control the content. Of key importance is what is left out. On the other hand, the major players in the commercial press are also centralized today. The fake news talk came from Trump I think. I am sure someone will correct me if I'm wrong. Trump got his education from a man named Roy Cohn, and to know the great and highly unusual character and lawyer Cohn is to know Trump. Cohn was capable of creating a storm of contradictions, one simply could not penetrate it. And it worked, until it didn't work, but for a long time it worked for Cohn. Is the American press good? Is it doing it's job for the American public? No, of course not. But it is not as bad as Trump says it is. The normal operation of the American press is to titillate the public but not to really rock the boat. We don't want people to stop shopping. So fake news seems to be a charge, like an indictment of the press, but it sticks at least a little bit because there is some truth to it. Who is the philosopher here? Probably Baudrillard. The news is written, for the most part, before it happens. The story is ready before the event even happens. We also have Marcuse, the totally administered society and individual. After saying all this, however, it must be pointed out that many people who care to find the truth (or something close to it) can find it. They may not want to find it. It may not all come out at one time, but they can find it. And finally, regarding America, we are a big country. It is just hard to fool everybody all the time. 

I suppose the latter point it the most difficult because you can't test the theory until it either totally fails or doesn't in which case you don't know if you've reached the end of your test. But in practice, there are other resources which allow us to evaluate. We often, for example, simulate theories in our head. The meaningfulness of this simulation will be a factor of the sophistication of the theorizer, but this is overcome with this simple truism: that a society can't generate a theory that is more sophisticated than society itself. 

If God exists (the Biblical God as you mention), then there are certain conditions for you to be in harmony with God, a presumably beneficial condition for your life path. If those conditions aren't met, then the consequences are documented to you beforehand, and they are dire. It helps to be true rather than false in life. 

I see you've been taken by the Christians who conflate Jesus with God. You mustn't allow this. The Jews, who know the language of God, do not accept Jesus as God and that is significant. The Christian idea of everything in the Bible being the word of God is nonsense and has created several schisms in the journey of Man. It was very clear in the Commandments, for example, that we were to erect no false idols (like the crucifixion) or put anyone before God. Since Jesus didn't exist then, then this commandment is unambiguous and important to understanding to how to receive understanding about Jesus. Putting faith in Jesus has denied Christians receiving any revelations whatsoever. Their theology hasn't engaged since Luther. They have made themselves, effectively, robots for Jesus, while they act flagrantly against the commandments, seeking out and killing people ("Let he who has not sinned fire the first bullet"). The only explanation for this is Satan himself. 

Well there is a link between these two philosophers. I first read about it in a book on Wittgenstein by Robert Fogelin on Wittgenstein. Probably this book, but it's been so long ago I don't exactly remember. Title: Wittgenstein Author: Fogelin, Robert J., Publication Date: 1976. So you may want to start with the Phenomenology of Spirit, which Fogelin mentions, I believe. $URL$ Here are some notes of J.N. Findlay on the The Phenomenology of Spirit: $URL$ Brandom has done some work on the two: $URL$ Beyond the Phenomenology, a general book by W.T Stace on Hegel, and it is perfectly fine to start with Stace. $URL$ Also, there are works by Hegel himself on Internet Archive, including the Encyclopedia translation by Wallace. Another interesting work and with good scholarship: "The Communist Ideal in Hegel and Marx", by David MacGregor. $URL$ This old, old book by the German professor H.M. Chalybaus gives a flavor of the time: "Speculative Philosophy From Kant to Hegel". Which is available in English on Internet Archive. $URL$ This quote by Findlay is worth remembering I think: "Hegel's thought, properly understood, has a place for all the nominalisms, pluralisms, formalisms, materialisms, subjectivisms, mechanisms, structuralisms, and so forth, to which it might seem opposed, so that there is indeed some sense, and not mere absurdity, in identifying it with philosophy itself, rather than with a special philosophy". JN Findlay, in Hegel The Essential Writings by F. Weiss. 

Yes, it is possible. Modern science biases itself on observation -- a powerful basis for an ontology of the world, but not infallible. You can start there, in epistemology and solipcism. I'll also give you this little nugget: empiricism is highly dependent on measuring instruments. However, every instrument implicitly encodes an ontology -- a model of the world. The problems of this should be self-evident. 

The reason is thus: immateriality has an unbound number of degrees of freedom in which to solve the massive constraint problem that is life itself, whereas materiality is bound to it`s matter and the history (some would argue design) of substantia. To say "incorruptible", however, isn't quite right. It's just that, because of the unbounded nature mentioned above, it can rebound back to it`s purity quickly. I would say animals are equally incorruptible, however. As to why our thought should be unique to humans, the Bible remarkably has the most interesting answer: the apple. Sugar is the substance that creates the extra force in the brain that allows it its extra step of self-awareness. What was the first thing Adam and Eve did after eating it? A: Knew that they were naked. Now presumably, it takes more than eating sugar for that self-awareness to occur otherwise other animals would exhibit these qualities This is where Jewish theology is a bit more sophisticated: it took also the act of disobediance. Going against the perfection of God by eating from the Tree which was explicitly forbidden was the act that some Jewish texts cite as the source of our freed-thought. 

I have erased some of my over-the-top comments and I am writing a short answer really to put Barinder's question back on top again because it was a good question. My feeling is that Nietzsche is writing an anti-philosophy, and that he would suggest that we humans operate on the level of the instincts. The only check on this would be the true ascetic aristocratic mode of being. The true aristocrat was after land and he was a warrior, not a thinker. Rarely will you find an aristocrat and a thinker in one person, though Descartes had the misfortune of running across one with a very cold library. Aristocrats fight for what they want, and they satisfy their instinctual urges without any qualms, but this requires a warrior spirit and this requires a fit body, and this may require a somewhat asetic life. We philosophers (who know our Nietzsche) are called to give up our thinking, and our word play to to become this kind of "philosopher-aristocrat", if you will. This is very much Nietzsche's version of the philosopher king, not Plato's. The second point would be on Descartes' "I", and whether perhaps Nietzsche had studied some Buddhism (idea from Schopenhauer?), and that Nietzsche began to question the idea of the "I" in Descartes (i.e. Buddha would say no "I", no ego, it is not to be found). At any rate, if Buddhism worked to calm Schopenhauer's Will, it would actually defeat Nietzsche's larger project of turning man into an instinctual doer, with the only possible check against the gross display of instinct being the temperament of the true aristocrat (the ascetic, warrior temperament, not a life of luxury and gluttony). Of course, Nietzsche could not actually "insist" on anything it seems to me, at bottom, his philosophy or anti-philosophy says all facts are interpretations, and this is itself an interpretation...so this is doing, instincts and not thinking, with all the problems and benefits that come along with doing and not thinking. 

The only "evidence" is by induction. The Law of the Eternal states that anything that can exist, will, given eternity. Posit: YHVH is the continuously-emanating singularity that we know as the Big Bang. As it is a singularity, it, perforce, incorporates other gods or demi-gods encountered within the Hebrew calendar (including the Christian one). Couple this with the actual first-hand reports and observation from the Jewish Orthodoxy, then you have sufficient evidence by induction. 

True and False are neither axioms nor expressions, they are results of the calculus. An axiom is an expression that forms a basis of a logical construction. An expression is set of symbols/words within an (implicitly or explicitly agreed-upon) grammar. True and False, then, are the (potential) results of an expression that follows a "compatible" (i.e. agreed-upon), logical grammar. In that grammar, I would take the words "true" and "false" both as symbols and as the common conceptual meaning (despite the ability to make a twisted grammar which would create the opposite). In any case, they are the end point, not the beginning. The source of your confusion is the internalization of (the premises of) science as the beginnings of your reason -- a historical construction that you've accepted as your point of departure in relating to the world. There it just assumes True the "object", and more tacitly, the objects of reason. Ditch science for a moment, if you are able to, and you'll find that you float in something more primordial, the mystery itself, of which logic came.
