As for the nut tool. I used to have an and had some difficulty but life got a lot easier when I switched to a . One of the guys I climb with is pretty much a guru at removing these things and he uses a (He got it after the gear review came out). I have tried it and didn't find it any easier than mine though. See answer 1 

Parachute cord aka paracord comes in basically 6 major types based on weight limits of 95 lbs to 750 lbs. Type 3 has a weight limit of 550 lbs and is referred to as 550 paracord. Usually when someone says paracord they are referring to 550 paracord. For bear bags and tying tarps and tents and securing gear 550 paracord works perfectly well and is cheap and readily available. On Military grade 550 paracord the sheath has a weight rating of 300 lbs and has 7 inner strands that are each made up of 3 braided strands. Most commercial 7 strand cord has 2 lines twisted to make each of the 7 inner strands. You can also find commercial variety with a different number of inner strands. If you are looking for something other than 550 paracord the major questions to ask are what diameter do you need and what strength. Almost any where you go from 550 paracord it will get more expensive. For comparison Mammut is a company that makes climbing rope and rates their rope all the way down to 2mm (which is rated for .85kN) and 2mm is usually around $.10/ft. For your uses 550 Paracord will probably work best and be cheapest. 

Well does it? Or does it only grow on one side? Or does it grow only on the side further from the equator? Is there any truth to this old adage? 

Aggressive Climbing shoes are often also referred to as Cambered. The Arch of the foot and/or the toe point downward. Non-aggressive shoes have a flat bottom. Images compliments of rei.com. Some people will use the term aggressive to mean tighter as well, but I have seen that to be less common. You want your shoes to be crazy tight, regardless of their shape. Also, the more aggressive the shoe, usually the longer break in period and the more painful. This shoe is tilted but you can see the bottom is pretty flat. It is "non-aggressive" 

and doing a little more research after the same can be seen in the official map for another run that crosses the bridge available here (the elevation map in the bottom right shows the same drop between ~17.5 and 20 miles when the route is south of the bridge's half way point). 

Why would this be? Is it a coincidence that the dividing line appears to be right in the middle of the bridge? Are such anomalies common? 

Approaching the bridge area all is well, we have height mapping data that matches where the road it. The height data is following the land not the road so moving onto the bridge you initially see the downwards curve of the riverside not the upwards rise of the road. At a certain point the height data stops, so the last/nearest point with data is used for the altitude reading. You can see this in the trace as a flat line. In the middle of the bridge that point is no longer the nearest, son on the first trace a point on the south side is so its altitude is used (see below for why we think the details here differ on the second trace). This causes the precipitous change in the chart. Again there is the flat reading, as there is not real altitude data so that nearest point is used as a best guess. Once there is altitude data available, it again follows the land not the road and you see the rising curve of the river bank. Once beyond that curve we are no longer elevated above the land by a raised section of road and the trace is again following both the lay of the land and the road. 

Extra information as per the comments below: I'm using a TomTom GPS watch and their standard web interface. I have had a thought and will review the raw data from the device when I get home to see if the anomaly is there too or introduced in later analysis. I don't know what the data sources for the other graphs were. 

On a recent run which crosses the Humber Bridge my GPS watch seems quite confused by my altitude as I crossed the bridge, as if there is an 8m shear drop half way with the south side being lower. You can see this clearly on the graph plotted after uploading the watch's data: 

I've always just used tape marketed towards climbers (including Metolius brand tape) and reused the gloves, applying more tape as needed (although I have friends who make new gloves every time). Gloves last me almost a whole season in this fashion, so I don't worry about price too much. Other athletic tapes don't always work as well, for some reason, but there may be exceptions. $4 isn't totally unreasonable, IMHO 

The old advice is to "Take nothing but pictures, and leave nothing but footprints". Almost any amount of memento-taking is going to lead to some kind of impact in anything but the most isolated of areas. The details of what is and isn't legal are going to vary with the exact area you're in -in the US, Wilderness Areas, a national forests, Bureau of Land Management's land, and state forests, all have different governing bodies and different sets of rules. Even different national parks are allowed to set their own rules. But I think they all prohibit you from taking mementos. And, besides all that, I find that in this age of social networking and photo sharing sites, a handful of good pictures can capture the experiences of my trips better than physical stuff does, although that's purely subjective. 

Disclaimer - I should mention that my answer only applies in the context of the original question. I'm discussing my experience rappeling in a rock climbing context, using a dynamic single or half rope, a "stich-plate" or tubular belay device, and an autoblock backup (not a prussik). I can't speak to rappeling in caving (where the gear would be different) or in rescue situations (where you'd be rappeling with the weight of 2 or more people) Actually, rappelling down a wet rope is about the same. Its just that everything else in climbing becomes more dangerous when its raining. :) I live on the east coast of the US, and we get rain pretty frequently. There's about a 30% chance of scattered thunderstorms nearly every day, and rain is just a fact of life. I get rained off a route maybe once a year. While I can't say I enjoy it, actually rappelling down a known rappel route in the rain isn't all that bad, especially if you can stay tied into a rope system the whole time (i.e, you don't have to scramble unroped along a ledge to get to a rappel anchor). The rope dynamics don't seem to change all that significantly. I always rappel with a regular tubular belay device and an auto-block backup, and I usually rappel with the device in "high friction" mode. (note - I also use a 9.8mm or thicker rope) I would think that the rope would get slipper-ier, but it seems like the ropes get thicker and heavier when they're wet, so maybe that counteracts it some (my rope is supposedly "dry treated", but gets fatter anyway). What is more dangerous 

As mentioned in the other answers and comments the altitude is not coming from the GPS readings. Because satellites are essentially on the same plane (relative to the sideways difference in their locations) altitude calculations have such a high error range that (at least on consumer-grade phone/watch style devices) they are at best general indicators. For this reason, again also alluded to in other answers/comments, reference map data is used instead. There is effectively an altitude difference of the road either side of the river, the south side is lower at the point that the height mapping data becomes available than the north side at the point that the height mapping data becomes available. The available height data is the issue - in the sources used there is nothing (not even a reading of the riverbed height) for the bulk of the bridge. The data used only contains data for land that is at least mostly permanently above water. If you look at the trace either side (I didn't notice this before) you can see it going down as if it is following the river floor not the road height. Where this is no data the height of the closest point with data is used. The closest point with data switches about half way over which is why there is a sudden change, because as per point 2 there is is difference in altitude between those last points with altitude data. 

Having talked about this to a couple of people offline who have some experience with mapping, we have a working theory (though I'll not accept my own answer unless+until others confirm these ideas). 

as we cross the half way mark going south ~4.88Km in and the reverse ~19.10Km in as we head back north. My first thought would be to just assume a fault in the watch's calculations, but I remember noticing the same signature in another trace of the route from a previous year when doing a little research before the run like so 

Exactly the same occurs in reverse on the return leg of course. The two half-marathon traces I included seem to be using slightly different map data. On the trace taken from my trip the riverside is an obvious curve and the "no data" section is shorter. On the other trace the altitude data stops closer to the sides of the river so the flat parts of the trace are longer. Also it seems that instead of using the nearest point on the map for which there is data it is using the last point visited for which there is data, so the sudden change in altitude occurs when altitude data "appears" again (near the sides of the river) rather than half way between the points where there is data, so near the end of the bridge the traveller is heading towards rather than in the middle of the bridge. The trace on the full marathon PDF is a little different again because the traveller never goes further south then the bridge exit, immediately turning under the bridge to join the other carriageway to go back north. Comments? This seems to make sense in our heads at least... 

You're framing this as a question of "how much will this hurt my climbing"? I wonder if you could use this down time from actual climbing as a chance to focus more on pure climbing specific strength training, and possibly come out of the whole process a stronger climber. Something I tend to do is all but quit route climbing in the winter, and take it up again in the Spring. In that "down time", I'll still boulder once a week, and incorporate some climbing specific strength training. I lose a lot of endurance, but gain some strength, and usually come back in the Spring as a slightly stronger climber. If you keep your strength up, endurance will come back in a month or so. If you already have rock rings and a pullup bar, have you thought about doing the official rock ring training plan: $URL$ ? Metolius published a 10 minute workout plan that includes finger strength, pullups, lockoffs, leg raises, all climbing specific stuff. It all done from a hanging position, so it shouldn't tax your lower body, and it would build a lot of climbing specific strength. And since you're planning on not climbing as much anyway, you could try and hit it a couple times a still have several rest days (at least for your upper body). You might actually come back stronger after the marathon, and be able to train endurance on routes on top of a better base of strength. I feel like something like this (10 minutes of pure upper body strength training a couple times a week on rock rings), plus one gym climbing session a week, would integrate with your marathon training. But you'll have to listen to your body as you go. 

Sorry for not giving a single recommendation, as in many situations in climbing, there are multiple options, and its important to know what the tradeoffs are. Carabiner As per usual, you want to make sure your carabiner is loaded along its spine. That is, longways. So, one end of the carabiner will be running through the leg loop or belay loop, and the other end will have both strands of the autoblock coord. What I do I place my autoblock on my main belay loop, then extend my belay device with a PAS. The rope runs down between my legs, and I can use either hand to control my descent. My autoblock is made out of coord that I measured and cut specifically to be too short to catch up in my extended belay device.
