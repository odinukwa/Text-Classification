Face value is the value of the item immediately, without regard for the future. For example, the "face value" of a $20 dollar bill is 20 dollars. I remember this because it is, literally, written on the face of the money. The present value includes a valuation of the future of that money. If I can use that \$20 bill to obtain something else, such as risk-free bonds, then the present value of that $20 bill can be much higher, it might be worth many times that initial face value. Here's a simple formula showing one of the possible relationships between the two terms: $$Present \ Value = \Sigma_{t=0}^{\inf} \ FaceValue * i ^ t $$ Where t is the number of periods in the future you are looking, and i is the risk-free bond rate I mentioned already. If you have a sharp eye, you will notice we have assumed that people value all periods (today, tommorrow, etc.) equally. This is probably false, but simplifies things for now. More complex assumptions are available, (and more complex formula!), but the idea remains the same. 

Terrorism is noted to have an impact on the performance of several major economic and financial indicators, at least in "small" countries like Israel or Spain. The idea that it could influence the price of gold is not unreasonable. I note that the physical consequences of terrorism are relatively small and localized in terms of physical and human capital- not to diminish the loss of those who suffered. I simply mean they are small in comparison to say, the broad and sweeping consequences of a simple 1% change in US interest rates. However, consider that the reaction in financial markets could be composed of a combination of the following: 

Number of buyers Price of complements or substitutes Customer tastes and preferences Consumer income 

If you are looking for more complex articles, Heckman in particular studies this, but it is econometrically heavy for undergraduates. Note that there are two different effects you are asking about. First, you are looking for an economic explanation or model of why people find themselves regretting the amount of work they are doing after the fact. Depending on how you define regret, this can be modeled by allowing the agents to be surprised by their own mortality or other statuses. They will, after the fact, wish they had not valued the money so highly! Secondly, you are looking for agents who explicitly value money tomorrow more than today. Awkwardly, the literal interpretation of this will not get the behavior you are looking for. If agents actually valued having money tomorrow more than today, they would never spend money and only save it! But, it is perfectly possible that agents value the money in the future too much, just not more than today. If this still describes what you are looking for, you should take a look at inter-temporal choice, particularly hyperbolic discounting. 

Terrorist attacks function as a signal that safety and security of capital is lower than previously believed. Humans may have behavioral tendencies to overreact to large, public events. 

I understand the economic evidence towards language unification is probably very positive. But I would note it may have some negative effects on research and development. Establishing a single language lowers the diversity of human language possibly playing a role in learning and technological growth. It may also lower the value of some types of language-important leisure time. Outside of our field, beliefs about this particular subject are rather strong. $URL$ 

It is not surprising, therefore, to see movement of human, physical, and financial capital in response to terrorist attacks being realized. 

Yes, there is some evidence that immoral behavior, as exemplified though political corruption, is bad for economic development. The body of literature is large and to the extent that I am familiar with it, some corruption can "grease the wheels" and hasten development. In general, massive amounts of corruption is seen as a serious hinderence to development. $URL$ Also, I think that the utilitarian ideal suggests that all else being equal, more wealth and consumption is better. This implies that economic development carries a moral weight. That is to say, an ethical society should develop economically, to raise the standard of living and reduce suffering. 

There are two circumstances where there are no gains from trade that I am familiar with. However, there are always non-negative gains from trade in the standard model. If a trade was bad, the countries simply reject it, it is a consensual trade. First, if the opportunity costs are equal between the two countries, there is nothing to gain from specialization, the countries are identical and there is no benefit from producing the good abroad rather than at home. Second, if both countries are entirely interested in only one of the goods, there can be no appreciable gains from trade. Suppose they produce nothing but gold or dung. Then both countries only produce gold, and regardless of their comparative opportunity costs, they cannot be incentivized to trade that gold for any amount of dung. 

Becker has a very widely cited paper about crime that generally defines the literature, here. To examine your proposal, increases in productivity generally lead to higher wages in the legal sector, but could easily increase crime rates if they disproportionately increased the returns to crime. No agent modeling or network theory is needed for this to an accepted idea in the literature, but you're welcome to explore it if you think the consequences are somehow divergent from what I've outlined here! Furthermore, the actual task to -verify- his theory is very difficult. To search "the literature", I would search within the body of papers citing this particular Becker paper. 

The behavior of any theoretical agent requires a traditional proof. These are the only ones fit which such a proof can be done, and serve as comparative benchmarks or predictive models. Explaining, and/or empirical evidence is needed for any real agent, because they can't be "solved". 

The market for lemons. Paper is here. The example most commonly given is used cars. The result is market failure. 

Assuming the products are substitutes (to some extent), and are distinguishable: an increase in price of the higher quality good will increase demand for the lower quality good. The reverse is also true. The intuition is that as the price of one good increases, all else equal, people prefer to abandon it in favor of the substitute. You may find yourself switching from traditional pig bacon to so-called turkey bacon as the price of pig bacon increases, for example. This happens even though most people believe turkey bacon is of lower quality than traditional bacon. Sometimes high and low quality products do not substitute, they may be too different to serve the same purpose. For example, consider parachutes. Some fabric is high quality for parachutes and will be used. The low quality fabric for parachutes may never be used (no burlap parachutes!). If you cannot distinguish the products from one another, in the short run, the chance to get a good (at random) from the combined high/low quality market has a price somewhere between the price of the original high and low quality goods. The larger the proportion of high quality goods in the market, the closer the price will be to that of the high quality good. Speculatively, when the products cannot be distinguished you might have a "market for lemons" in the long run. That is, eventually, high quality producers would choose to cut costs and produce lower quality products instead. The consumers have no incentive to trust the new mix of products, and eventually the market fails or converges to the low-quality price. 

Since you understand the graph, let us note for casual viewers that the supply curve is perfectly flat. As such, we can see clearly the area of the consumer surplus, (the triangle between the equilibrium $p*$ and the supply curve) is 0. So the producer surplus, (and profits) are zero. Intuition: The scenario must be one where the entire quantity demanded can be satisfied without having any diminishing marginal returns. Marginal costs and average costs across the industry must be flat along the relevant range. If you assume a linear production function, you may get this result. 

The tradeoff between work and leisure has been extensively studied. I would start with the wikipedia entries on labor supply: 

I would note that the value of a stock is highly speculative and prone to herding effects. Let's say today the stock of company X is worth $100 dollars, but the price is subject to fluctuation by chance, investor decisions, and real improvements in company X. When the stock price of company X goes up to \$101 tomorrow, an uninformed investor may reason that informed investors know something about real improvements in company X and have bought into it, driving the price up. As a result, the rational, but uninformed investor also buys company X. This behavior persists even if the price increased by random chance because it is possible that the price increase is legitimately due to improvements in the company. A critical thing about this is that the investment good is not the same on each day. In the first period it is a "good with no known information". In the second period it is a "good and a positive signal". You are paying extra for the attached signal, whether or not the signal is accurate.
