This first aspect of Dunbar's Number specifically identifies a "stable social relationship" as one where every person within the group knows everybody else and how they're related. This can't be done with social media which is intrinsically anonymous in nature. The important aspect to understand here is that Dunbar's Number has more to do with the quality of the relationship than it does the quantity of relationships. You will meet thousands of people in your lifetime — but how many of them do you actually remember? 

EDIT Raznarok got me thinking (a good thing on this site, right?). In the beginning, the primitive society would benifit by a few, insignificant things (tools, utencils, broken glass...). At the end, it would speed things up considerably (wait, you mean that machine cuts wood? What do the rest do!). HOWEVER, "considerably" is a relative word. The technology we enjoy today was fundamentally developed ONLY during the last 150 or so years. If you assume Clarkean Magic such that the entire power infrastructure, buildings, tools, etc., did not decay, then you might reduce that 150 year period to 25 (at a guess). BUT, compared to the thousands of years it took to get to that 125 year savings, my estimate drops from 99% to 98%. It's still pretty insignificant. 

1 Please forgive me for forgetting the quasars and blazars are believed to be special cases of black holes. Mentioning them at this point in the text is improper as the OP was asking about "what if we can't harvest black holes?" If you can't harvest black holes, you can't harvest quasars and blazars, either. However, I didn't bother to rewrite the paragraph because I suspect y'all'll understand my point (and, having found a good reason to write "y'all'll," I couldn't pass it up). Cheers. 

In an effort to help you rationalize/explain your universe, if gravity operated not on the inverse-square law, but on (for example) an inverse-cubed law. Planets and stars would on average be smaller, but the force of gravity would decrease much more quickly with the distance from the mass. This would allow for bands of mass between planets (maybe, see below) and more mass between stellar systems. However, the faster gravitic drop-off would mean planets would all orbit closer to their suns, so there might not be anything between them anyway. Worse, there's nothing you can do about planets sweeping the gas into themselves as they orbit. Finally, the amount of mass you're talking about, even at its thinnest to keep it breatheable, would mean you couldn't see even your nearest planetary neighbor. Heck, you probably couldn't see your own moon. You might not even be able to see your own sun (if you can, it would be as a lightened smudge in the sky). It would be a very dark universe. 

17.73 * (0.25 hours + 0.05 hours) + 15.10 * (1 + 0.05) = 21.174 hours. Dang! That's fast! This suggests it takes a LOT longer to either absorb a human, move to the next human, or both. Let's say it takes 0.5 hours to absorb, then what is the average get-to-the-next-human time? 32.83 * (X + 0.5) = 27,000 X = 821.92 hours or, basically, two weeks. The Thing must really like instilling fear in humanity because taking two weeks to get to the next course in the meal is a long honking time. Answer: The Thing can take over Earth and most of Alpha Centauri in 27,000 hours 

You have actually created a circumstance were people are unlikely to believe in or practice astrology because it would be in competition with an established religion that has physical proof of its reality. Practitioners of astrology on your world would be quickly labeled blasphemers and driven underground. People are people so why should it be, You and I should get along so awfully (Depeche Mode) However, for your story to be realistic it must reflect the nature of living, reasoning, mistake-making beings. My own faith seems quite obvious and easy to believe — to me — but there are billions of people on the planet who don't understand it, don't "get it," and there are even those who don't want to. But to really make this behavior clear, let's look at it in a completely secular way. People know and understand the power of the State. It's there, every day, in the form of governors (prophets), legislators (apostles), bureaucrats (evangelists), law enforcement (bishops), laws/ordinances/regulations (scripture), etc. (illustrative association with religious titles is my own and only meant as a simple example. No offense is intended.) We believe in this power, it is manifest, and even does good for people on the earth (police protection, welfare, etc. And yet, there are multiple political parties because people have different beliefs in how government should affect people. No matter how well government manifests itself for the good of the people, there's always someone who wants to change it, replace it, or circumvent it. When we're impatient we violate the law and speed, when we're greedy we violate the law and defraud, we risk being caught by this very real, very organized, "religion." For people to be believable on your world, you must accomodate those who, in the face of manifest power, will nonetheless seek to fulfil their own desires. They are outlaws in every sense of the word. People with divergent beliefs, mixed interpretations, etc. Some (call them "anarchists" for lack of a better word) who simply want to reject the manifest authority in favor of their own (or, quite often, in favor of simply wanting to be left alone). You'd be surprised over the number of people who simply want no responsibility, who reject any and all authority no matter how obvious, how manifest, because they want to just do their own thing. So, I understand that you don't want astrology in your world and, frankly, you've created as good a situation as I can imagine to avoid it. But remember, "people are people." There really isn't a way to stop them from believing in and practicing what they want. If you force your story otherwise, it will always read a little flat. You need to find a balance, because good and evil will always exist together. 

This is so utterly unrealistic that it's making angels weep. Few women can have 17 children in their lifetime, and of those who can, I'd bet almost none want 17 children. Add to that the fact that people die... a lot... and I'd bet reality is less than 10% of these results. In fact, it might be less than 5% of these results. 

Certainly not. There are quasars and pulsars and nova and heaven only knows what other sources of energy are out there. Quasars and blazars1 may be a bit too rare to be practical. It's like always having to drive a 40 mile round trip to get gas in your tank. Pulsars produce a ton of energy and are more frequent. In the long run, suns may have the lowest collectible energy density, but they're so honking common that practicality wins out over efficiency. In reality, your people would use a variety of sources. A passing quasar for a quick top-off would never be missed — but a star if you must 'cause it's right over there. 

I make no claim that any of the previously used reasons to traipse around the world would be suitable for a couple. 

I'm not going to try to address all of the societal impacts. That's way too broad. What I will do is disagree with my predecessor answers. People will become much less prone to death. Life is Cheap Taking away a life would become a much more frequent method of punishment because it doesn't matter nearly so much. Further, havind died the first time and having lost decades if not most of a lifetime, the threat of a second round of capital punishment becomes much more real. In our world today there are a great many people who believe capital punishment as a deterent is a failure. They're right. Criminals have nothing to lose and the threat of death isn't actually that strong. It is a way of permanently removing from society someone who has proven themselves a constant and irredeemable threat to society. Now we can take two lives. Capital punishment means something because, having lived through it once, you have a dang good reason not to risk it again. It's the ultimate fine for misbehavior. Risk is for Suckers People in general become much less risk averse. Climb that cliff? Why not? Ride that rickety roller coaster? Sure thing! Play Russian Roulette? How much is in the pot? Knowing that you'll live through it the first time means you can easily and willingly take all those risks, even if they're not your risks. Unprotected sex with Aids? Who cares? Inconvenient baby? Just dump it in a trash can... it'll resurrect. As much as we aspire to nobility, the majority of humanity takes the path of least resistance: no responsibility, high selfishness. It's suddenly worth the risk to rob the 7-11 or mug the mayor. It has no more risk than losing the lottery. Life will truly become cheap... at least among the first lifers. Except for the 2nd Lifers... They'll be Paranoid The people who have resurrected once will become so risk averse it might actually change the economy. They'll do almost anything to protect the one life they have left, now that they know personally that it will end. In other words, the world will become just a little itsy bit like The Purge, where the 2nd lifers are barricaded in safe houses and the 1st lifers are out in the streets shooting everything in sight. (Maybe not quite that bad, but you get the gist.) After all, who cares if there's no risk? 

@ShadoCat is correct that this question will eventually be closed, but I'm going to refrain from my own instinct to do so because methinks the following needs to be said. Earth is only a conceptual reference So very many questions about living in a low-G environment come with the baggage of our Earth perspective. For example, you just arrived to colonize the Forest Moon of Endor. This is the usual perspective... how do I deal with my Earth-based body, construction techniques, perspective, etc? But let's assume that you evolved on a low-G planet. You'd walk around just fine. You'd build buildings, mine ore, etc. just fine. Why? Because you'd find solutions that work just dandy in your environment — just like we did. And that's the point. Earth doesn't and shouldn't represent some mental block in terms of how to work with different gravities. It's only an issue when you're talking specifically about humans within a short period of time. Because if enough time passes, humans will adapt to the new gravity You only need the metal boots if you want to somehow retain your Herculean Earth-based muscles. In reality, you would quickly learn to adapt to a lower strength requirement. Each passing generation would grow more accustomed to it. The eventual result would be muscle atrophy that makes walking on the low-G world completely normal. The same is true for facilitating everything we do. Mining means taking smaller bites and moving less material because you don't have the leverage of Earth's gravity. Big deal! You'd think we all want to jump off the planet for a heavy-G world because the mining would be simpler. (I'm not convinced that would be true, BTW.) The simple truth The simple truth, as unsatisfying as it may be, is that humanity would adapt. We're actually quite good at it. No magic. No high technology. I wouldn't be surprised if the first generation born on the planet were able to walk, run, and play without issue at all. If this doesn't work for you If this answer doesn't work for you, then we need to act to avoid its closure. That means narrowing the question (telling us about tech level, the size of the society, the needed industries, etc.) and reducing it from a "let's throw spaghetti at the wall and see what sticks" fishing-for-ideas question to a "this is my idea, will it work?" question. Narrow is the name of the game. The more focused the question, the less likely it'll be closed.
