OK so i am in a scenario that an enemy has a railgun and i can only rig a walker with ERA protection. How effective an ERA can be against railgun? ERA - Explosive Reactive Armour $URL$ 

Assuming that the human race survives long enough for us to answer all questions from how life began to the end of the universe, how would human race proceed when they are able to reach the theoretical limit of questions. I will accept theoretical answers 

We know its impossible to get that kind of armor with the current technology, so what i want is that what could we achieved with near future technology to come at least near it. The main goal for the armor is that it could at the very least survive an encounter against magicians who uses 5 basic elements Fire, Water, Earth, Lightning and Wind SO is there in anyway to achieve the above specifications with current to near future technology? What i had in mind is that the Non Newtonian fluid has multiple function such as being non newtonian to be able to resist? blunt blows, coolant and power storage to mitigate the problem of protection and power issues which can severely hamper the operation of the armor. I don't know how this can be achieved but that is one idea from my mind If not then What kind of technology would it need to be able to achieve the specifications above realistically? 

Assuming that you are flying in a powerarmor with the help of magic to assassinate/kill flying sorcerers/Forward Observers/officers. The rifle that will be used in this question will be McMillan Tac 50 shooting a modified .50 BMG bullet that has 90% reduction to air resistance and bullet speed has been modified to 1500m/s. Recoil has increased by 130%(I dont know how hard the recoil will be with the increase speed of the bullet(since faster bullet means probably more gunpowder used and thus has more recoil) Maximum altitude is 24000 feet with the help of oxygen supply from power armor How will it affect long range accuracy while shooting at this speeds 15km/h 20km/h 30km/h 45km/h 60km/h 120km/h or higher accurately shooting something at this distances 250m 500m 1000m 2000m 3000m 4000m 5000m~ also how hard is it to shoot something downwards assuming that you are 24000 ft in the air and your enemies are like 18000-22000 ft below you using the same gun and cartridge? Is it even possible to shoot and kill/heavily damage a person that is flying/riding at speeds of 30-90km/h without the help of tracking computer installed in the scope? 

Yes they can, the metallurgical and smithing techniques required to create steam engine has been achieved(bronze age), however you need to do it in time of Pythagoras or other great mathematicians as it is the time where proper measurements was universal. The hole in this answer would be who had the eureka moment and thought of this(Other is the probability of romans early application of gunpowder to warfare and economy) Perhaps the power of volcano(Etna or Vesuvius) shed light to how powerful steam can be? And no its not a powerful steam engine but it can still probably be used to power looms or smelter house 

In movies, novels, fictions and mythologies, it is quite often told/seen/heard that the blood of the gods are that of gold. I want to know how does gold colored blood works in biology, what are its chemical compositions, what makes it gold? 

ok so we have a world with an Aerial Navy with magic included. I mean Aerial battleships, Airborne Aircraft Carriers and all other sort of ships we can imagine flying in the air, mobile battle fortresses, Floating islands, Rocket planes, flying magicians with Wings. Situation The situation is that The whole world will be at war and those 10 nations are the primary participants on it with an emerging threat that is a kaijuu that will escalate into world crisis threat(This Kaijuu will be ignored in favor of the ongoing war, but the nations will keep it in mind but it will be a bit too late too react as they will face it as an world crisis level kaijuu that is almost immune to sorcery based and magic based attacks this includes strategic weapons) devastating south africa, middle east, south western Russia, western china and India. Gods won't interfere with the Kaijuu threat but they will provide information on its movement. Objective What Aerial navy tactics that can be developed and used that is analogous military doctrine from our world in the scenario stated above. Nations in comparison 

These 2 can be carried on an airship of your made, and dropping the nuke to the target is a big NO due to the fact that your airship can't go up high like Enola Gay can. What of the two options is feasible enough to be carried on a flying ship with enough range (2-7 kilometers preferably) with the minimum size of 155mm. Notes 

Ok, so we have an aerial ship that is propelled by thrustless levitation and propulsion. Considering it how much weight do they need and design to able to resist wind speed of 100-180 nautical miles per hour? assuming winds can come from headwind and tail wind of the ship size dimensions are from 60 meters to 800 meters 

USA (Before World War 1) UK Germany (Before its defeat in world war 1) Imperial Japan China Russia(Before the Red October Revolution) Austria (Before its defeat in world war 1) Italy Australia Canada 

What kind of scientific effect is needed to have thrust less propulsion and levitation plausible and make floating and moving battleships/castles possible since anti-grav engines will disrupt local gravity and make things haywire. Usable within earth-like atmosphere, If you've watched Last Exile, you might know what kind of floating and thrust mechanism they were using since it is all reactionless drive from their flying fortress to capital ships. I need a good explanation on how it would work. All materials will be used can be found currently in earth, you can include radioactive materials as well... must not overly harmful to humans Less technology more on physics/science theory is much more appreciated I don't really care what technology it is but i need to know how will a thrustless propulsion and levitation work. Please something that is theoretically possible with or w.o current technologies but plausible in physics. IT MUST NOT GENERATE THRUST! IT IS THRUSTLESS FOR A REASON. "Capable of exerting mechanical force with no observable physical reaction(Propellers and Thrusters)" NO SAILS Doesn't involve Gas filled ships! Consider Steampunk level tech My 1 idea for thrustless levitation is false gravity repulsion field, basically if gravity pulls you down, activating that technology should do opposite, instead it will counter the gravity and push you up in theory but then again theres no opposite "force" of gravity so i don't know if that is plausible with physics. Theres negative mass for levitation as well, inducing negative mass to a matter. 

AS the title says, Neutron and Proton bombardment as a WMD and how would it work? I've tried researching it but i can't find concrete answers but it is viable as a WMD. What would necessitate its use in ground and orbital warfare? 

"The Church of Violence" you need to achieve all 7 before 50 years(Your probable time of death) Your first course of action will be the total destruction of both crusading army and jihad army during a battle of massive proportions including all supplies, leaders and its support structure. This should buy you 1 to 5 years of free action anywhere in the continent to further your agenda and goals focusing mostly on the common and poor folk. From then onwards what would be the probable step to achieve the 7 objectives in 50 years time The magic in this world are that what can normally be read on books or typical D&D game with more powerful magicians capable of destroying battalions of troops. Normally only magicians can beat magicians. 1 out of 50 people in this world are magicians. It is said that the magicians pulls of their magic from their belief, you on the other hand believe that it is not. YOu can expect little magicians joining your church however these magicians that you will breed will be a different kind one as you'll be able to teach them how does the world works. Technology wise you can manufacture things that your are capable of thinking of, from simple clothing to flying ships(arks) of several kilometers long give if you have enough matter for the re constructor to use, with the atomic re constructor doing the hard work of production you should be able to at least shock and awe anyone you come across i mean you can raze cathedral down with your giant 'rod' of steel. Everything you produce you can store it on your time space watch. The hard part on the watch is that it doesn't tell time.... Not to mention your control over the orbital cannon is something that should be used wisely and strategically. It is not something you want to squander as you need to preserve the shock effect of firing it to your enemies. I mean you can turn a battlefield into a fiery wasteland in no time, any one survives that or sees that will be sure to be awed and scared of you and certainly will follow you ot of fear. YOu can even make nobles grovel down to you just to prevent you from firing at their territory. You destroying an army is enough to ensure of the compliance of any one who is able to see your deeds. Also you must remember, you're the weakest human in that world. YOu dont have magic, you dont have the ability nor the capacity to survive in such landscape, you'll use your technology on hand to achieve the goals, but the paramount of all your goals require you to have the most powerful influence or at least someone of influence that is capable to swaying masses. And also your church doesn't shy away from violence.
