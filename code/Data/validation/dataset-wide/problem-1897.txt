You can't put all mistakes in the same bucket. A "your" when it should be "you're" does not warrent reporting unless it is in a contract. A SQL injection vulnerability on an outward facing server then yes report it. If in doubt ask you're boss. 

The easy solution is just don't do it anymore. There was a case where a guy that just worked maintenance for a sports team and he posted a trade was stupid. It was in the contract could not publicly bad mouth the team or management, he got fired, and it held up in court. 

Could be you have an architect that likes it to be his idea? And it looks like you like to get credit. Not a good combination. I have had more than one architect that was like that and the best bet is to just let it be their idea. You can say what what do you think about this and if they say OK then thank them for their idea. We had this controlling boss and one team member had it down to an art form. He would pose a question and then propose like his second or third option and give a hint as to his number one choice. Then the boss would come back with number one and take all the credit. 

It is not something that is typically appropriate but it kind of depends on the context. If it is was about syntax or stuff you can learn with practice then no. Let's say is was about a compiler design where if you have not been through the formal theory is not something you would readily pick up then maybe. But need to deliver with tact. Let's say you were at an accident scene and practicing bad (harmful) first aid and I was a Dr. To shut you down and get on with business I would say "Where did you go to med school?" 

I am really hoping the manager called you aside more to inform you and not to reprimand. Yes that is not a flattering statement but to me it is objective and you are asking how to deal with her? If she went through your email and did not have an approved business purpose then her finding it is her problem. Her reaction is her problem. If she had authority to go through your email clearly you would not have done that. Her going through you email is a problem and you should tell your manager. Don't approach her. She has already called you a bully and will likely consider any approach by you as bulling. 

You should talk to your supervisor. Tell them this man makes you very uncomfortable and what he has done and tell your superior you don't want to help this man. Use the term sexual harassment - that usually gets an employer's attention. If the supervisor says you must then talk to his supervisor. If that does not work you can just refuse to help and see if you get fired. As for the direct question of "Can I refuse to help him?" Yes you can refuse to help him but if you don't have permission from your supervisor then you could get in trouble or even fired. If the store can refuse to service to this man is another question. 

This might be better on startups.stackexchange.com Getting pushy is never a good sign. But that may just be their style. IANAL (I Am Not A Lawyer). Once (if) you get a written offer then have it reviewed by a lawyer. Stuff you want to look for is not being part of the down side. If you are offered outright equity and the company is sued then you could be exposed. Again IANAL. With stock options you take a risk of they dilute the stock. I don't know the right term but you want an option on an absolute portion of the company. Another risk is the company generates a lot of cash and they never go public so your options are worthless. Ask about funding. Can they afford to pay you for 2+ years. Even if you come up with a drug that works trials are very expensive. I would ask for a business plan. Clearly you want a salary you can live on as face it most startups fail. I summary ask for a firm offer and if you like it then have it reviewed by a lawyer. Accept it is likely the start up will fail but you will also get some experience you would not have gotten with a safe route. It appears you have skills that you can find a job. 

I could not pull it off but a buddy of mine used to present idea number 2 as something he could not quite figure out with a weak number one. Every time boss next day boss would come back with number 2 as a life saver. We called the boss number 2. 

The problem is that many people would consider it deceptive. I guess this is splitting hairs but I would not actually call it a hack. Web pages do it a lot so I can get how you feel like it is mainstream. Many company web sites do it. I bet recruiter agencies even use it to get hits on job listings. If you are just using synonyms then yes I get it seems harmless enough but enough people will not think so to make it not worth it. 

This is not a good situation but unless he doing this at work or you have a work policy he signed / agreed to then this is not a work issue. Say he was a member of a hate group most people would find offensive unless it violates a policy he agreed to then work cannot do anything about the post. Many companies have a policy about cannot defame the company on public media. I suspect some policies include cannot defame or harass co-workers on public media. If you are "at will" employment then you can be fired without cause. If you are somehow protected he could argue this is non-work activity and there is no policy against it. That said there does not need to be a specific policy against for a company to act. You probably don't have a policy against urinating in the parking garage and if someone did they would be disciplined. Take it to HR. I am just saying they will need to think about how to handle this. Any reasonable HR should address it. You might want to talk to you boss first to get his / her take. Your boss may chose to speak to his boss. I don't think confronting him directly is the correct approach here. A direct confrontation is maybe what this sicko wants. Where he is posting may have a policy against this. If so contact them. 

The PIP is not directly related to your raise. The raise was based on past performance and the PIP is more about current performance. It is really more about perceived performance unless the company has some good objective performance measures. Since you are the only automated tester it is perceived performance. You may be correct on multitasking but now is not the time for that debate. Ask for very specific goals in writing for the PIP so you have better chance of passing. If you just let it be the PM's perception of your performance then your chances are not good. The PM will need to justify firing to HR. Asking for less hours and less pay is more tricky. I think you need to get through the PIP first. When she says you need to multitask tell her yes I can multitask but when learning a new technology it is more efficient for me to focus on that. 

Contact a non-reference is definitely bad form. Tell the non-reference you did not get the job is definitely inappropriate. They should not even share that even AFTER you have been informed. Contact a non-reference is bad form. Even if you are going to do it why the office lady? Even if you gave them the general number they should have asked to be connected with your listed reference. 

"Have you made a decision?" If no, ask "Is there a time frame?" If no, "Thank you for the opportunity but at this point I have other offers I need to consider". 

You were given bad code and no documentation. If deadlines were missed multiple time then 1 week is not reasonable for you to recover. No documentation is a management problem. If you don't even know what the Small Slice is supposed to do then you cannot come up with a good estimate. I would make three lists of modules 

Consider starting with a conversation or simple inquiry on the hours seem off. Tell him his hours seem off and you need them confirmed. Have you had any conversations or email on the matter in the past? If it is a formal written notice then you need to get legal / HR in involved. Then as far as wording it "these hours seem wrong to me - unless you can provide proof then I will not approve them". 

Based on edits: I wanted to tell my superior, that I have decided not to pursue this opportunity. Is there any harm in telling my supervisor? Can I gain anything? What possible purpose is there to tell your supervisor you are not going to pursue an opportunity the supervisor was not aware of in the first place? Right now your supervisor considers you a loyal employee. Telling them you declined an offer is only gong to make them question it. They are certainly not going to consider you a more loyal employee. It would come off a veiled threat in my mind. If my wive told me she did not have a ring on when she went to the park for run and a guy asked her out and but she said no do you think I would find that comforting. I would be like why do you need to tell me that. If a girl flirted with me at the park and I did not ask her out do you think me telling my wife that would comfort her? Her thought would be why were you even approachable? Have you asked other girls out? 

If you call the hotline with very general description of discrimination they won't have anything specific to address. If you provide specifics then management will figure out it is you. Management is aware. I would let them work it out. If management is incompetent then calling them out is not going to help your career. HR gets know the number of minorities and receives write-ups. If they cannot do simple analysis they are incompetent. 

You may need to complete this task as an individual contributor to demonstrate your skill and ability to take orders. He has explicitly told you to only work on the small piece he has given you. I don't see that pushing for more right now is the way to go. He is clearly not ready to give a new employee architect and team lead. How long will it take you do complete this task? If it is a long task and you don't think you can wait until the end then approach him directly. Tell him you had a bigger role in your previous job and feel like you can contribute on a higher level. You edited that this is only a two week task. Just do the task and see how it plays out from there. Not the time to convince an unsupportive manager that you need more responsibility.
