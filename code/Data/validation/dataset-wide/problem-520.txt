Most likely duplicate but I cannot find it. In the free hub / free wheel you have pawls that are the coast / drive mechanism. Most likely they are gooked up or just plain broken. Some are serviceable and some are not. FREEHUB SERVICE You can also search on youtube. Or just take the wheel to a bike shop. You might be able to free it up with a bit of WD40. Remove the wheel and spray it down the axle. As for worth fixing. If it is just a service it would be like $40? But you take the risk the service does not fix it. You can get a cheap wheel for less than $100. No shocks makes it more worth fixing in my opinion as you have less other stuff to go wrong. If other than that is runs OK I would fix it. 

Look for city or touring tires. Road in bicycle means more of a racing tire. A tire like this go pavement and packed nicely Travel CONTACT. Almost all manufacturers will have tires like this. A road type tread in the middle but a little grip on the edges for if you do sink a little. Great answer from Batman (+1) but I don't think the Gravel Plus is an optimal tire for the needs you state. One it does not come in a 26 but you did not state that in the original question. The Gravel Plus is a relatively light race inspired tire. I commute on cyclycross that I also ride on light trails and I was buying the most roady "cyclocross" I could find and was burning through them every 6 months because they are soft light race inspired tires and not designed to be run on the street. I finally figured out to look in touring / city with a bit of tread. Yes a 25mm pure road tire will sink in gravel. But don't get a 25mm tire. Get a tire the width of your current knobby or slightly less. You stated you have 26 X 2.1 now. If you sink a bit now then stay at that width. If you don't sink then I would drop down to 1.75. 

It takes a volume of air to seat a tubeless. Even if you lube the tire it takes a volume of air to get it to pop onto the seat. Cannot deliver that volume with my floor pump. At the shop they remove the core to the presta and have this conversion tube they put over the open stem with a compressor on the other end. 

Carbon is more resilient to this the type of stress then most people give it credit for but still it is NOT recommend for even 2.38 lb lock. When you land a jump that 2.38lbs is a decent force. If someone dropped the lock on your head from a foot a it would hurt. You will even see recommendation from the manufacturer not to even mount a carbon frame directly on a rack. I mount my lock on the handle bar stem. Even if it is a carbon stem it is replaceable. Down on stem . Down and cross bars 

I know it is not cheap but if you are going to try spikes then go for some good tires that come with spikes and save your existing for summer riding. The base is imbedded in the tire so it has an anchor. As for if it will work for you? I think you just need to give it a try. Clearly studs will help. Again not cheap but a mtn bike with bigger studded tires would be your best bet. 

Check if Specialized will sell the pin stripe kit. But I would not recommend it. Tape over the old would be difficult and not sure it would stick. Remove the old could damage the bike. I would learn to like white. Consider bright green bar tape, seat post, and saddle. 

I try to not wash cycle shoes. I have found a boot/shoe dryer to be effective with odor. The old style without a fan seems to work better for shoes. Leave the dryer in for a day and cook that bacteria. No I don't have medical information the dryer gets hot enough to kill bacteria but it seems to work. It gets rid of the odor and the next time they get wet they don't seem to stink up as fast. And a fresh set of socks with every ride. According to this link you can kill odor bacteria with heat Foot odor 

A head light addresses cross traffic and head on traffic. Too often vehicles are looking for vehicles and don't see a bike that is in plain site. My experience is that yes a strong flashing light in daylight helps being seen. I live in a large city that is not particularly bike friendly and I definitely feel it helps. I took these picture through my truck window in full sunlight at 1:00 PM. This is 400 lumens. A light is a safety tool. On cross streets and driveways don't assume the vehicle is going to stop and don't assume they see you. I wait for the vehicle to stop and I wait for them to look at me. With a light they don't just see you better it is easier to tell they saw you. They will hesitate on the light and then typically make eye contact. I feel like the super bright makes a difference. They don't just see you - you get their attention. I know you ask about daylight but at night a powerful light puts out enough light for vehicles to see your light from a cross street. You might think I don't need a $100 600 lumen light to see the road and at low speeds you don't. The higher power lithium ion led lights we have today I feel are much more effective for be seen. 

When you land you tend to go out the front rather than the back. You pretty much never land in perfect alignment and even if you do you get pushed around. If you land front wheel first the rear wheel is going to come around and only get worse. When the rear does touch it will be out of alignment. As you absorb with your arms you only get more forward and go out the front. If you extend your arms and put you weight back as far as you can you have to take the whole hit. Your body is not in a position to help absorb the landing. Rear wheel first the font is pulled into alignment and front steers so the front (can be) in alignment when the wheel touches even if the bike is not yet in alignment. Also legs are longer and stronger than arms to absorb the shock and can stay in position on the bike. Even if you are way rear wheel early you can shift weight forward and your body is in a position to absorb the landing. 

This has gone a few hours with no answer so will give it a try. Consider spend too much. There is the purchase cost and cost of maintenance. Low end bikes commonly refereed to as BSO (bicycle shaped objects) don't last long and are expensive to service. With a BSO you get custom (as in bad can't replace) components. Many bike shops will not even work on a BSO. You need to get up into named brand components (e.g. Shimano and Sram). Looked used and less movable parts (no suspension and no gears). My trash (as in lock it on the street) commuter is a bike is a single speed name brand I got used for $400 and was $1200 new. Mile for mile it is as cheap as you are going to get. New I know an $800 bike is way more than $300 but if you are going to ride it more than a few hundred miles it is cheaper. Trick is find the guy / girl that bought an $800 bike and did not ride it and is selling it. Yes people want to get 60% to 80% of what they paid but used you can get it for 30%. Minus the lights and tires this is a bike I got used for $400. Mile for mile I don't think you can do better. I have put 4000 miles on this bike and two set of tires and two chains. 

This is sooooooooooo wide open. You lose like 1/3 rolling it out the door. Condition matters more than years. If it 10 years old with some out of date components that matters. But 3 versus 5 does not matter. I buy used nice bikes and never pay more than 1/3 retail. Sometimes you can get a new bike for 80% retail at end of season. I could sell every used bike I own for what I paid for it. If you are using it for a year then used. If you know nothing about bikes then you might get ripped off. High end bikes lose value faster. A $200 BSO is not going to lose 1/3 out the door but it is still not worth $100. Best value is picking up like a $1200 bike for $400 or even pay $400 for a $900 bike. They are cleaning out the garage. 

Any bike is going to flex when you pedal The harder you pedal the more it will flex So first the question is if it is flexing too much Inspect both the wheel and frame for any damage or weakness If the wheel is not centered then it will rub on one side first Make sure it is centered If it is centered and no excessive flex then the tire is too large If you cannot get the tip of your pinky finger between the tire and frame then you most likely don't have enough clearance 2.1 is extra-ordinary if the bike want not built for it - that is cross I have a pure mountain bike that tops out at 2.1 

Bicycle parking is a convenience but it is never a factor in my decision on if a ride my bike. Worse case I lock my bike to the smoking bench. At my gym I have a secure bike room so I will ride my nice bike. But if I did not have the room I would still ride my beater. Now a good bike route is a factor. If you want to encourage biking then work with the city on bike routes/lanes. 

On that style of bike saddle in the lowest position is OK. On the size cart you are right in between. Ask the shop. Hopefully they will let you ride both. 

Yes that is as single speed freewheel and those two pieces should not stick There are some serviceable freewheels (White) but they are expensive Pretty sure you need to replace the freewheel Based on the rust it looks old If you remove it from the bike and it sticks then for sure you need to replace it You can try spraying a lubricant in the grove but most likely the bearings are shot A freewheel is like $30 and it takes a special tool to remove Take it to a bike shop If you buy the freewheel from them the often install for free or a small fee Or check youtube for videos on how to do it yourself The removal tool for a single speed is like $25 so not worth it unless you are going to do it a few times And if you are going to replace the freewheel then it is good practice to also replace the chain As Brian stated this can also happen from a chain to tight. Chain should have a little play. And crank the pedal a few revolutions - some times the chain can be more tight in certain positions 

Pretty sure Shimano SPD Shimano SH56 SPD Cleats Multi Release You need to match to pedals and it looks worn out 

With the horizontal dropout the axle can shift. You pretty much need the nuts to get a tight enough grip. But I suspect people have used quick release on a single speed. So Sheldon states an enclosed cam is good enough - not good enough for me. I am not buying the historical reasons as I see new bikes with nutted horizontal dropout and still QR on the front. If they were doing it for historical reason they would nut front and rear. At some point you need to trust that he manufacturer did it that way for a reason. I have never seen a manufacturer with QR on a horizontal drop out. The other factor is alignment. I typically tighten the non drive side first and tweak the drive side for chain tension. The other factor is the axle size. On my single speed the axle/skewer is much larger. I have never seen a nut on the smaller size and never seen QR for the larger size. 

Mountain bikes in general are going to have a more seat post out compared to a road bike as that is the frame design. Mountain bike have a sloped top tube and road bike flat or slightly sloped. If you are using the bicycle as designed then it should not be a problem. Don't buy a small frame if you are 6 foot and put a monster seat post on it. Mountain bike also have bigger diameter seat tubes - typically 31.6 versus 27.2. As stated by chored there is a minimum insertion distance. 

Down hill is where you need to be very careful as easy to go out the front. But down hill the rear wheel is already unweighted by the angle so you need to use the front just be careful. 

Trek has road, hybrid, and mountain bikes for kids. Guardian specializes in kids bikes. Look for a small frame and 26" or 650 wheels. Some kids are not going to like drop bars. You can put road tires on a mountain bike. Go like 32mm+ for kids as they are going to hit pot holes and jump curbs. A bike they like is what is most important. I usually buy used but in kids I don't find as good of deals as I do in adult. A bmx is not going to be the most efficient road bike but it is strong and they can bmx in it and it fits a broader size range. You might find a nice one used. Stay away from cheap BSO but some times you find them at garage sales for like $40. 

Sounds like you are getting slack during the ride. This will happen with new cables but if you get it every ride something then else is going on. My thought is that your barrel adjuster is not holding. Does it look like this? The barrel adjuster should have a lock nut or something to hold it in place. Mark the position with tape or a marker and see if it moves during the ride. The M 191 is a lower end Shimano but you should certainly expect much better performance than this. And congratulations with getting up to 20-25 miles a day. 

None of the answers mention tubeless tires. A tubeless tires has no tube so no tube to pinch. The primary purpose of tubeless is for lower pressure. Need both tubeless rims (wheels) and tubeless tires. Can get conversion kits for regular rims. Tubeless comes in fully tubeless and tubeless ready. With tubeless ready you need to use a liquid sealant. Tubeless ready is a more common. 

That would be a single speed chain as it is internal gears. The first tool you need is chain lube. The second tool you need is a chain stretch tool. It is hard to wear out a single speed sprocket. Don't assume you need a new one. Take the wheel to the shop and ask them what tools you need. 

They typically use S&S couplers But compared to the time to break and assemble a rack is less tedious. You also have folding bicycles But the don't perform as well a regular bicycle A break down bicycle is going to have better performance but takes longer for break down and assemble Break down and folding bicycles are more expensive On a regular frame you are not going to get much benefit from a full disassemble compared to just removing the wheels. Beyond that lower the seat and maybe spin the bars 90 degrees or remove it. A full disassemble and assemble is hours of work and something I would want to do in a shop with a full set of tools. 

It is a very minor dent but horizontal mid tube is not a good spot. Creasing a tube does reduce the strength. A hard landing or hard bump is where that would likely be the first point of failure. Even if that section has lost 50% strength it would take a lot for the bike to fail. The rest of the frame is there and even 50% strength on that section is a lot as most bikes will take a lot. If you land hard enough to bend that frame you are probably going to crash anyway. Frames that break or bend were typically crashed hard. If your body landed on the top tube that would be the first point of failure but if you land on the tube hard enough to bend it then ouch. Once you stress aluminum past the yield point it does fail rapidly but not technically catastrophically (it does bend not snap), Look at this video for the just ridding along (jra) scenario. That dent is like the opposite of the jra scenario. But is shows you that it takes a lot. Notice once it deforms then it fails petty rapidly - that dent is the start point for the deformation. Pinkbike Visits The Santa Cruz Test Lab Video In summary I ride it but I just don't ride it hard and don't do jumps. It would take a hard crash for it to fail. I don't foresee any scenario where it fails on a ruff section and causes you to crash.
