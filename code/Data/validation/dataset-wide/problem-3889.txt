Consider an elliptic curve. This is $\mathbb{C}/\Lambda$ where $\Lambda$ is a lattice. As a real manifold this is a two dimensional manifold. Therefore, if we want to have an etale cohomology theory compatible with the real cohomology theory the dimension should be two. 

I've got a new criterion for comparing Galois reps which are four dimensional if we know the kernel of the residual representation mod $5$ (or any large odd prime) and the Sato-Tate groups (should be same for each one) are connected. Note that we don't need to have a large residual image, so this applies to a different set of representations than Faltings-Serre. It also doesn't use a large tower, making it stronger and more efficient than existing variants of the Livne method. What I don't have are some good examples: the one I was working on when I discovered this method really requires a criterion that works for $p=2$, which is a lot more complicated (and I don't have a handle on yet). So does anyone have some Galois representations to compare lying around meeting my critera? The kernel of the residual representation may be hard to determine on the automorphic side: I'm working on ways to fix that. 

Sato-Tate has a much more general form in random matrix theory stating that the Satake parameters are distributed as the eigenvalues of some random matrix in a compact Lie group related to the Zariski closure of the image of the associated Galois representation. The measure is just the Haar measure on that group. This applies to abelian representations, and recovers Hecke's equidistribution result. 

Let $G$ and $H$ be groups over the ring of integers $R$ of a local field $F$ with finite residue characteristic $p$. Suppose we have a surjection $\phi$ from $G(F)$ to $H(F)$, and another surjection $\bar{\phi}$ from $G(k)$ to $H(k)$. Is this enough to conclude the image of a parahoric in $G$ is a parahoric in $H$? 

When considering the heat kernel of a Schr\"odinger operator $$- \Delta + V(x) $$ where $\Delta$ is the standard Laplacian on ${\mathbb R}^n$ and $V$ is a nonnegative potential function that has nice behavior at infinity (proper, grows polynomially), one usually sees the term $$e^{-tV(x)}$$ and the asymptotic expansion of the Gaussian integral $$\int_{{\mathbb R}^n} e^{-t V(x)},\ t \to 0.$$ If $V(x)$ is homogeneous, namely, $V(rx) = r^\alpha V(x)$, the above integral is just a power of $t$ (in particular, no log term). However it seems that in more general case when $V(x)$ is not homogeneous, for example, when $$V(x, y) = V_1(x, y) + V_2(x, y)$$ which is the sum of two homogeneous polynomials of different degrees, the expansion may have $\log t$ terms. Question: What is the general form of the asymptotic expansion of this integral as $ t\to 0$? 

I think the recent work by Huagui Duan and Yiming Long $URL$ showed the existence of at least two closed geodesics. 

Suppose $F: {\mathbb C}^N \to {\mathbb C}$ defines a singularity at the origin (for simplicity one can assume that $F$ is a quasi-homogeneous polynomial). Suppose it is nondegenerate, i.e., $dF(z) = 0$ only at $z = 0$. Let $D_i \subset {\mathbb C}^N$ be the divisor defined by $\partial_i F$. My question is: is there a natural condition on $F$ to guarantee the following (or can we prove the following under the nondegenerate condition): For any $I \subsetneq \{1, \ldots, N\}$, $F$ doesn't vanish identically on (any component of) the intersection $$\bigcap_{i \in I} D_i.$$ 

Consider the Lagrange multiplier $$F(x, t, c) = f(x) + t( g(x) - c).$$ If $g$ satisfies your condition and $f$ is generic, then one can show that $$S:= \{ (x, t, c)\ |\ \nabla f(x) + t \nabla g(x) = 0,\ g(x) - c = 0 \}$$ is a 1-dimensional manifold. Its intersection with $c= a$ or $c= b$ are the critical point set of $f|_{g=a}$ and $f|_{g= b}$. This implies that (if $a$ and $b$ are generic), then the mod 2 counting of the two critical point sets are equal. In your counter-example, the $g = 0$ slice corresponds to a so-called "birth-death" which is not generic. 

While trying to prove one property of commutative rings with units I can't prove one fact without assuming existence of infinitely many different prime ideals or elements. I tried to test if it was the neccesary assumptions, but I failed, since I don't know any "toy"-examples of such rings. I know only one example of this kind ($\mathbf{Q} [x]/ (x^2) $ ) but it's not a domain. So, Are there any infinite domains with finite number of prime ideals? If no, then are there any infinite domains with finite (but nontrivial) number of prime elements? I am interested in noncommutative examples as well. Sorry if this question is too elementary. 

You can think of finiteness conditions from other point of view. Suppose you have some category (say, Set or Top) which have both "nice" objects and "pathological" objects. Then, it is natural to ask if there is a subcategory ("smaller" one) in which every set is "nice". That way, if your only goal is to study a single "nice" space you can study it's properties in subcategory and conclude something about larger one. To study "smaller" category you need it to have some "nice" properties, like being cartesian-closed or something. That way Comp is "nice" subcategory of Top where you can use a lot of toopological constructions. Now suppose, you want to study Von-Neumann universe of all sets. The only other, "smaller" von-neumann universe you can build is universe of heredetarily finite sets. That way $H_\omega$ is a "nice" sub-universe of $V$ where you can use almost all constructions fro mset theory (the only axiom which isn't true in $H_\omega$ is axiom of infinity). But original question was stated not in the form "Why "niceness" properties are important" but "why finiteness conditions are important". Given that an answer to first question is much more understandable, we can say that finiteness conditions are important because all known "niceness" conditions are finiteness in nature. So , for example following "niceness" condition in Top which doesn't look like finiteness condition is in fact equivalent to compactness: $X$ is "nice" iff for every topological space Y projection $X\times Y\to Y$ is closed. This situation ("niceness" conditions are hiddenly "finiteness") because almost all categories we study are set-like, so given a "nice" sub-universe in set-like category we can construct an induced "nice" sub-universe in Von-Neumann universe $V$ and the only nontrivial von-neumann universe is precisely $H_\omega$. So, finiteness conditions are important because every regularity property in set-like category arises from a refularity property in universe of sets $V$, and the "best" regularity property in $V$ is a condition of being hereditarily finite so any good regularity property is esentially a finiteness condition. Also note, that most of named finiteness conditions are actually "heredetarily finiteness" ones, they are usualy inherited by sum sub-objects.
