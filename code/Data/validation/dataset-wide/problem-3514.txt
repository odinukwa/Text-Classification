The Laffer curve merely describes the relationship between tax rate and tax revenue. It assumes that workers are most motivated to make money when the rate is 0%. It also assumes that as the rate increases, their motivation decreases. These two assumptions are the basis of the shape of the graph. It would therefore be understood, based on the two aforementioned assumptions, that at a 0% rate, the total income of the society is of large magnitude. But the graph neglects to depict this. All in all, I think the graph neglects to depict three thrings: 

let j(x) = behavioral curve let a(x) = a perfect bell shape = (1/50)(-(x-50)^2) + 50 let a(x) = money collected at x% rate of total income-- j(x) = (1/100)(x) (j(x)) a(x) = (1/100)(x) (j(x)) (100)(a(x)) = (x)(j(x)) (100*a(x))/(x) = j(x) ---substitute the equation for the perfect a(x)--- (100*((1/50) (-(x-50)^2) + 50))/(x) = j(x) 

Are my graphs accurate? And, if they are, are there preexisting graphs that describe the relationship between workers' income, workers' behavior and tax revenue? or is the Laffer graph the only one of the sort? 

And most importantly, doesn't it make more sense to say that the rate at which people are discouraged is not constant? 

Now, if one would argue that the Laffer curve should not be bell shaped, and rather should have constant slopes, we could deploy my graphs to show the absurdity of that assumption. The only society that can support a Laffer curve with constant slopes would be in a society where those taxed don't lose motivation to make money. This was, I believe, shown to be an impossibility during Communism in the USSR. Because it is a given that society becomes less and less motivated to make money the more they are taxed, using may graphs we can show that the Laffer curve must have changing slopes. I graphed a society with indifference to the tax rates using my equations. It can be found this link: $URL$ I was playing around with my graphs, creating different situations each depicting different worker behaviors and I noticed I was unable to choose a behavioral situation, (the orange curve in first situation above and green one in the second), where the tax revenue curve (the purple curve in first situation above and blue one in the second) would be a perfect bell shape like Laffer depicted in his curves. So, I decided I would work backwards. I would first draw the tax revenue curve and derive the formula for the associated behavioral curve. This requires simple algebra. 

Possibly, eternal rapid growth is not possible. Possibly, 1% growth in real GDP per capita (correcting for population size and inflation) is an achievement when you're already rich. However, in the sense that some might expect growth to be slower, it can be pointed out that a large number of workers are not trained for post-industrial jobs, and this limits the possibility of the various companies in the economy to effectively deploy those available human resources. These workers may become "discouraged" (stop looking for work) not be counted among those actively seeking employment. Also, there is an argument that rapidly reduced cost of leisure is causing many men to play video games (for example) and work less. If they are not actively seeking work, they are not counted as "unemployed". Also, increasing industrial concentration tends to reduce competition, which negatively impacts the competitiveness of those firms internationally, thus negatively affecting both employment and growth (while positively impacting profits, at least in the short-run). Other similar arguments are at times packaged together under "situations in which higher inequality is bad for growth". 

A great many things can be said on the question. But it might be worth pointing out that people have been building stuff for a very very long time, so maybe 1% productivity growth is not a bad result. The most difficult is anti-corruption. You could compare the free press + independent judiciary + empowered investigative authorities within specified limits + free elections ... with the approach of President Xi, whose name is now entrenched in the Chinese constitution. However, it seems that you're more interested to motivate a specific theory. So perhaps you could develop that and come back with a question that is more aligned to what you want to know. For example, you could be additionally descriptive about what it is about Tesla's operations that might have broader lessons in construction? (Note that Tesla makes cars, not ports, not bridges and not roads.) 

If a biotechnology advance lowers the production price of corn from 3.50 dollars a bushel to 3 dollars, then farmers who do not have access to this technology now must sell at 3 dollars without enjoying any of the productivity gain, a reduction in income of 50 cents a bushel. In considering the potential truth in the statement in the textbook (with respect to the context of 2018), one must focus on the question of "who is hungry?" and not "how much food is there?" There would be more food, but the distributional effects would be negative on those most likely to be hungry. Who is hungry? Many of the people who are most likely to be hungry are poor farmers, who would simply receive a lower price and thus have less economic resources to obtain goods and services on the market. 

The workers' income and how it changes as rates increase, the behavior of the workers as rates increase, (this is similar to but different than the first neglect), and the basis of the Laffer curve shape. 

So, I decided to first graph the behavior of the workers as the rate increases, which would then affect the amount of revenue the government took in (which, when graphed, is the Laffer curve), and then, just for fun, I included the disposable income. The x axis is the tax rate and the y axis is money amount-- in the United States, dollars. All y values are arbitrary. You could see the graph here: $URL$ Because the behavior of the workers is arbitrary, any depiction of their behavior would be sufficient for my purposes. Therefore, if you click on the link, you can see two different situations graphed, each situation for a different type of behavior. (For simplicity, I disabled the graphs for the second situation). Situation one: The orange curve is the total income of the economy before taxation, the purple curve is the tax revenue and the black curve is the disposable income. Situation two (not enabled): The green curve is the total income of the economy before taxation, the blue curve is the tax revenue and the red curve is the disposable income. The total income curves are shaped like they are because as the tax rate increases, society works less, (or is less motivated to make the same amount of money), and as a whole, has less total income. The tax revenue curves: Because, number one, as tax rates increase, workers are motivated to make less money, and, number two, the rate at which they make less money is increasing, the value of tax revenue does not increase at a constant rate. In fact, after a certain rate (changing depending on the behavior of the workers) tax revenues start to decrease. 80% of 60 dollars is more than 90% of 43 dollars. The tax revenue curves are, in essence, the Laffer curve. And lastly, the disposable income curves are simply, 

When graphed, j(x), the behavioral curve, has a constant slope. (You could see it here: $URL$ We said before, "Because, number one, as tax rates increase, workers are motivated to make less money, and, number two, the rate at which they make less money is increasing, the value of tax revenue does not increase at a constant rate." I assumed that the rate at which people are discouraged is not constant. Clearly, if the Laffer curve is a perfect bell shape, I was wrong. But was I wrong? Would it make sense to say that a worker is discouraged the same amount between rates of 5% and 35% as they are between 50% and 80%? Doesn't it make more sense to say the rate at which they are discouraged is changing? If we assume yes, can we disprove Laffer via using may three graphs-- namely, you can't use a perfect bell curve because it leads a constant rate of discouragement? My questions are: 

So they can set their own monetary policy for good reasons such as to improve macroeconomic stability. So they can set their own monetary policy for bad reasons such as to print increasingly devalued money instead of engaging in better macro management. So corrupt people can print and/or otherwise control monetary within their country. So other countries will not control the value of the monetary instruments used in the country. Because they don't like Uncle Sam or the Fed. Because they don't trust EU bankers. 

You don't have to apply a single continuous function as required in many textbook applications. Theoretically, you could say something like "beyond production level x, some other factor kicks in which begins to apply pressure". So, below production level x, f(x) is the function, and above production level x, the total cost function is the sum of f(x) + g(x). This is still a somewhat simplistic and theoretical representation, but for practical applications could be updated with some variety of parametric or non-parametric approaches. For example, perhaps some social media platform succeeds quite a lot in reaching 1 billion users under economies of scale production conditions, but then its per unit costs rise a lot beyond some threshold, for example due to: concerns related to privacy, data localization, spread of fake news, speech which promotes violence or hate against individuals based on ethnicity or religion, etc. Each of those concerns would enter as an essentially separate cost function into the overall production activities of the company. (In terms of pro-competition concerns, it would be arbitrarily easy to not apply such rules to start-ups with size under one thousand or one million users, etc). 

GDP is a statistical indicator which is an estimate of production that has already occurred, or an estimate of the current or future level of production. The units are generally nominal, or adjusted by some variety of methods to correct for different changes in price levels across a changing production structure (e.g., more smartphones, less typewriters). So I'm not sure if this involves confusion or disagreement about the precise meaning of "GDP", or a misunderstanding about the sequential order of logic. Specifically, the order in time is 1) production occurs, 2) there is a measurement indicator intended to reflect the production which actually occurred. For an example of how this could be important, consider the following example. Production increases equally across all sectors by 5%. However, a change in price levels can differ from one sector to another. So using some methods the statistical indicator called "GDP" will increase by precisely the same 5%, and according to other methods of calculating GDP it could be different from 5%. Conceptually, differences in these methods might be straightforward to understand in principle, but implementing the methods can become complicated, and there is liable to be some "art" in determining which method is most appropriate for measurement, or for the use of the statistical indicator called "GDP" depending on the specific application. For example, if exchange rates are very important, such as in trade analysis, "real GDP" could be less important for knowing the effects on the overall budget situation of the government or the cost of capital in the financial system.
