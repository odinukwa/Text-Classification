Even if the rate of interest is unchanged, a greater amount of debt implies more interest to pay. This effect holds by definition. A greater debt-to-GDP ratio might increase interest rates. The magnitude of this effect is controversial. The example of Japan in recent decades (high debt ratios, low nominal yields) demonstrates that the effect is not very large, even if it exists. 

Invoice or dirty price: what you actually pay; and the clean price, which is the dirty price less accrued interest. 

There’s any number of ways the price can end up lower, and short of questioning everyone involved in trading that day, we have no idea what really happened. I will now give an example how intuition about supply and demand can be misleading. Imagine that Acme Inc. traded yesterday at \$10. The next day, market makers set the price around that price, with a bid-offer spread. There is no trading. Then imagine that at 10 am, Acme announces a successful lawsuit against it by the plaintiff Wile E. Coyote. The market makers are shocked, and drop the mid of the bid/offer prices to \$5, and still there is no trading. Meanwhile, retail stock traders who did not know about the lawsuit saw the new price, and rushed to buy. 100 customers buy 100 shares each for the market makers, who are happy to sell out of inventory. From the persepctive of an outside observer, we saw 100 retail traders rush to buy shares - and the price fell by half. 

Could a country that controls its central bank (e.g., Canada, Japan, United States) replace its debt with money issued by the central bank? Could the ECB do the same thing? 

As originally written, parts of the question are unclear. We do not normally calculate the government debt of two countries together, they are calculated independently. Adding up debts across countries can be done, but the debts are quite oftenly in different currencies, so that would need to be taken into account. The standard for government debt calculations is to add up the face value of all debt emitted. Yes, this does not take into account the differing interest rates, but one can usually find out the average interest rate. So in your example, both countries have debts of \$100. (As an example, the U.S. Treasury has a webpage on “The Debt to the Penny”, with the total face value of debt; Link to FAQ. Per issue data is found in the reports available here: link to Monthly Statement of the public debt.) One could look at the market value of government debt, but these data are not usually provided by national statistics offices. Financial data providers (bond indices) have this, but the data often misses out short-term debt, and non-marketable debt. 

Yes, it’s the uncertainty. If you tried hedging the currency, the hedge would be generally such that there would be a loss that offsets the interest advantage. (This is known as covered interest rate parity. In oractice, there is a spread that causes behaviour to deviate from that -the currency basis. So you can lock in a small spread, but it is typically on the order of 10 basis points or less. During a financial crisis, the basis can get relatively large.) If you do not hedge, the volatility in the currency rates over one year is normally greater than the interest rate differential. Buying a high interest rate currency is known as a carry trade. It is profitable until it isn’t. For an example, look at the Japanese yen in the early to mid-2000s. In that period, Japanese interest rates were the lowest in the developed world. It was thus a popular currency to short. It would then have periodic bursts where its value would shoot up, forcing shorts to cover. 

The government just consumes within this model, as is similar to other standard DSGE models. Therefore, its consumption (G) never has an effect on productivity. Imagine a wartime situation where the government is buying goods that are used to provision the army; the goods are consumed, but will not help develop the domestic economy. If you wanted to simulate government infrastructure spending raising productivity within these models, the government infrastructure build would have to be added to business investment (raising the capital stock). The "real government debt" constraint says that although the nominal level of debt is fixed, if future taxation policy is expected to be "too low" relative to the nominal stock of debt, the price level will rise now. This the Fiscal Theory of the Price Level. The governmental budget constraint is used to determine the formal relationship between the expected primary surpluses and the real value of current government debt (effectively, the current price level, since the initial nominal debt level is fixed). With regards to your examples, even if debt due was greater than GDP, the situation can be sustained. (We have seen debt-GDP ratios greater than 100% in a number of countries, including Japan at present.) Most of the debt will be rolled over into new debt. That is, in year 2 of your example, the government could just borrow the nominal amount equivalent to two tons of corn, and roll over the debt from year one. (This is possible since these are models of monetary economies, in which nominal claims - money and bonds - are used in exchange, and not just goods themselves, see below.) The issue with sustainability is whether the debt/GDP ratio will tend to infinity. If transactions were barter transactions with real goods, you could then have "real debts" which are payable by goods (corn, say). What the limits are for paying back debt depends upon your assumptions about the payment system. Normally these models assume simultaneously clearing of all transactions in a period. However, if we assume that there are multiple transactions possible within a period (and we are only simulating the aggregate), the government in your example could borrow corn from some members of the private sector, and then use that to pay off other lenders, and then repeat the process until the entire debt stock is rolled over. If that is assumed not be posisble, the government would have to lengthen maturities, so that only part of its debt stock needs to be rolled over, and the previously described procedure is again possible. Having debt with multiple maturities is avoided in DSGE models due to complexity concerns, but it would be necessary if the payments system was restricted like this. 

I would note that there is a similar question already: link to question on interest rates and inflation I would summarise the answer there as follows. 

As comments above note, they are regulated and certainly want to be seen as good corporate citizens. Furthermore, although hydro is largely renewable, they do not have infinite power generation capacity. They do not want to run their system near capacity constraints, as that would cause brown outs. However, they also have a financial incentive. BC Hydro exports power, and they will be able to charge more for that power than they will get from regulated consumer uses. (Otherwise, why export?) The less consumers use during peak hours, the more peak hour sales they can make. 

The question as it stands now contains points that are debatable. So I will just attempt to answer a similar question; the question could be revised in response. There are a number of other questions on QE that offer some background. 

The yield-to-maturity is similar to an internal rate of return, so the calculations need to take into account the timing of cash flows. So your example calculation 10%/.90 = 11.11% does not work. (That is known as a simple interest convention, which I think is sometimes used in the Japanese bond market.) The calculation form depends upon the coupon frequency of the bond. For an annual coupon, if we denote the yield as y, then the price of the bond equals (convention of \$100 equals par): $$p = \sum_{i=1}^8 \frac{10}{(1+y)^i} + \frac{100}{(1+y)^8}.$$ However, I do not know what “required return” in the question refers to (a true internal rate of return?). You would need to find the price of the bond using that “required return,” and then work from the price equation to get the yield. 

The answer therefore ends up: what is the effect of inflation on how the central bank sets policy? This is the subject of monetary economics, and is an open-ended topic that cannot easily be answered here. In practice, we often see the central raising rates as the expected rate of inflation rises. Since they are worried about expected inflation, they do not automatically react to every wiggle in measured inflation. For example, a central bank may not react to an oil price spike. (Reactions varied during the 2008 oil price spike, with the ECB hiking, and the Fed not.) 

If you want to focus on the real world, we need to realise that the savings equal investment (S=I) is an accounting identity. That is, it always holds, no matter what. Importantly, it holds on any time frame, which means that every single transaction will obey it. (You would need to imagine an extremely short-term national accounts that reflects just one transaction.) Therefore, there is no conceivable set of transactions that break the accounting identity, assuming that the accounting is done correctly. The supply/demand relationships in the real world are trickier. Production of goods could exceed "demand", as the excess ends up in inventories. However, we could pretend that the increase in inventories was planned, and so once again production equals demand. The money supply/demand relationship just tells us that the private sector allocates between "money" and "bonds", but that appears to be another accounting identity. (I am unsure about that statement, and it may take a few steps to get to that point. Since all financial instruments end up being held by some entity, presumably supply and demand have to match.) In other words, accounting identies always hold, and that is independent of what any particular model says. If we return the model, "equilibrium" is an assumption/solution technique to find a solution to the systems of equations. That is, within the IS/LM model, the market balance conditions determine the solution. If we change the model, we might get difference conditions to determine the solution. Since a mathematical model is not the same thing as the real world, we should not say that real world behaviour is directly related to the mathematics. That is, it is unclear if it makes sense to ask whether the real world reaches "equilibrium", without defining what real-world phenemona define "equilibrium." Instead, the test is whether the mathematical model (whose solution is defined by "equilibrium") offers useful insight to real world behaviour. 

The seller of the bond (more likely, its bank) will get a deposit ("money"). The Fed gets an asset (the bond). 

Show that the clean price falls as yield increases, and vice-versa (by inspection of the clean price definition). Show that the relationship between price and yield is one-to-one, i,e., for any yield, there is a single price. (This is not obvious, but I think this is a standard result for discounted cash flows where all future cash flows have the same sign.) Show that if the yield on the bond equals the coupon rate, the clean price is par (for any date). Yield/price conventions were chosen precisely to get this behaviour, but one would have to validate depending on the convention. We should see that a lot of terms cancel out to get the desired result. This step requires the most algebra. We turn to your original statement. We assume that the clean price is below par. (We use (2) to show that this price is associated with a unique yield. Not sure whether this step would be necessary.) This is less than the price when it is trading at par; we apply (1) to show that this implies that the yield is greater than the coupon rate. 

If you look at the chart, the biggest fall in the ratio after 1980 was during the late 1990s. There was a brief fiscal surplus, and growth was relatively strong. There was a technology boom, along with the tech stock bull market/bubble that generated a lot of capital gains taxes. (The Clinton administration raised taxes earlier, which was also a factor in the surplus.) (In a comment, you asked about the 2000s. During that period, the ratio rose, but that can be partly traced to the increased defense spending that happened. Once again, there’s too many moving parts in the budget and economic growth to give a simple explanation of how the ratio moved.) 

I looked at that video only briefly. Trying to interpret what that interviewee said would be an opinion-based answer, which this site wants to avoid. I will instead try to answer the question without referring to his comments. In my opinion, I have serious doubts that the economist in the video could offer a convincing explanation of what he said. Note: it is incorrect to refer to future entitlement spending as a “debt”. At most, it is a “contingent liability.” A debt is a financial claim, held by an owner. An inability to distinguish between debts and contingent liabilities is a signal that he is an ideologue, and not a reliable source. This also means that the 200+ trillion debt is a worthless figure, as it would need to be held in context against future tax revenues as a capitalised asset - which will also run into the hundreds of trillions of dollars. (1) The linkage between “the promise to pay” on currencies large existing debts and contingent liabilities is presumably the threat of inflation or hyperinflation. In the case of a hyperinflation, a currency is often withdrawn from circulation, and so it cannot be used to pay for things. However, I cannot name a serious body of economists that treats hyperinflation in the US as a possibility under current policy settings. (2) A promise to repay on currency is just a promise that it will be redeemed at par value by the US government. This means that banks can convert currency to deposits at the Fed (“reserves”) at par. Although this is just converting one US government liability for another, it does distinguish currency from other tokens that might circulate (foreign currency, gift cards, etc.). For an individual, since they do not bank at the Federal Reserve, it gives them a right to exchange currency at par for a bank deposit - or to settle tax payments. From the perspective of Chartalism (or neo-Chartalism), the “promise to repay” derives its importance from the fact that currency will be accepted at par to settle future taxes. The prospect of the need to settle taxes is what gives currency its value. Although settlement at par seems natural, it was not always the case. Pre-Federal Reserve, cheques (check in American spelling) drawn on other banks with weaker reputations would not settle at par. That is, you might need to write a cheque of \$110 to settle a debt of \$100 at another bank. The “promise to repay” (and payment system regulations) mean that these “internal exchange rates” disappear.
