While training to be a teacher, I was trained by... you guessed it... another teacher. The difference was the experience level and qualification. Once can split workout-types into two groups: 

Set: Check form and breathe in to brace core (1 second) Lift (1 second). Lower (1 second) and breathe out. Return to 1. 

Bodyweight skills definitely have an upper limit, unlike weightlifting which is limited only by how many plates will fit on the bar, leverage can be varied quite a bit, increasing the difficulty of these skills. Progressive resistance makes you stronger. It does not matter if this comes from varied leverage, or extra weight. Both bodyweight and barbell training will help you gain muscle but for example with squat you cannot add more resistance with bodyweight to develop raw power. Also, its well established that for barbell training, if done correctly at high intensity, will stimulate more muscular growth than bodyweight exercises for the same muscle groups. There are many stories of people who don't weight train and end up lifting very large amounts their first time out, due to body weight skills. Here is a video of Ross Enamait deadlifting 495lbs (at 170lb body weight) with no deadlift skills and a primarily bodyweight-only training routine. Simply, it's going to take me too long to develop the strength to squat 495lb if I go down the bodyweight-only route compared to if I were to go down the barbell route. 

You look like you are trying to gain weight for whatever reason. Most sources state that when losing or gaining weight you should aim for a 0.5kg change per week. However, it is highly individual and you should diet plan to eat 10-15% above your Total Daily Energy Expenditure and then measure your weight change. Make sure your breakdown of protein, fat and carbs is sensible and you are exercising regularly.

This routine is comparable to a 6 day, +1 rest day, push-pull-legs (PPL) routine but instead of pushing/pulling, the focus is on hitting every single muscle group twice over the week in the super-compensation period. Your Question: Is the Rock's routine suitable for a beginner? It is not optimal, a beginner should really focus on a compound lifting routine to build strength (like starting strength, 5x5 stronglifts) before moving onto a PPL or body split. That way you will be able to get significant noob gains and then hit progressive overload on your PPL/split without stalling too much. Is it suitable for you? I will edit my answer once you provide the information I asked for the comments. 

Short exercises I can do of a morning, without specialist equipment, that will specifically help me with balance and both flexibility and strength in my legs and back? Look to reddits r/bodyweightfitness for more help with these but here is a list of the recommended exercises: Leg Work (progression) 

To insinuate that after such a short time doing weights with very minor resistance that your are now "big" could be construed as insulting to people who would hack off a limb to put a inch on our arms/legs/chest/back within that timeframe. As correctly pointed out, you have a "pump". This happens in a major way during exercise and lasts afterwards to some extent as you repair your muscles and build more. The only way to track progress is with a measuring tape and you are unlikely to see any major change in your body shape while working out as the change is so minor. It is worth noting that psychology plays a big part in self-perception here, always get a second, third and forth opinion (reddit's r/progresspics can give you some indication/help). Thank you for setting your targets clearly. Those goals are achievable but you need to understand what the 'real world' implications of those goals are. Goal 1: Smaller Figure How to achieve: Monitor your calorie (and macronutrient) intake and simply eat less than you use up. Websites like IIFYM.com can help you set your target calories and apps like myfitnesspal help you track daily. Goal 2: Toned body How to achieve: This is achieved with increasing muscle size and decreasing body fat. Tone is a myth, it simply doesn't exist, you only have fat and muscles. To achieve the "toned" look you need to have a balanced program of lifting weights and cardiovascular exercise (Ask here for a program if you want!). Pair that with a diet to reduce your body fat percentage and you will get the "toned look". Side Note: Soreness This is called DOMS (Delayed Onset Muscular Strain). Basically, you did something your body isn't used to and your body is working overtime to repair itself, it is not a injury; if you go for a 5 minute run you may notice that the ache vanishes as blood pumps round your system. Keep training, warm up and cool down properly and they will pass with time. 

The world standard is 320kg (705lbs) and these are equipped (belted). So technically, yes. Based on the information provided you can achieve a 600lb deadlift at your bodyweight without the use of steroids. As a general rule of thumb, you need to 'eat big' to 'lift big', a large calorie surplus will significantly help you progress your strength rapidly. 3 years to double your deadlift without eating at a surplus is very difficult and most of the people in this weight class weigh more and then cut before competition to hit their weight class. 

In the aforementioned article (Kolata, 2016), Dr. Hall, an expert on metabolism at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, is quoted for stating that the researchers involved in the show knew “[the contestants] will have a slower metabolism when the diet ends”. Following the show, Dr. Hall released an article that fully details the magnitude of dietary restriction and exercise intervention that the contestants experience. The findings of “Diet versus exercise in “the biggest loser” weight loss competition” (Hall, 2013) concurs with many of the points previously discussed here with respect to the contestants maintaining and continuing to attempt a diet that was known to not sustainable in the long term. Using simulation, Dr. Hall showed that the weight loss that contestants craved could be achieved by less drastic methods, thought the time needed to achieve and maintain their goals successfully would be in the domain of years and not months as was suggested by the competition. Other Relevant Studies Those who are successful at maintaining weight lost often experience positive associations with their new, lower weight. On TBL it is clear that negative associations with food can and have developed which might raise the probability of longer term relapse. The psychological symptoms for those who have been successful at long term maintenance of weight loss (Klem et al., 1998) are those of positive general mood and self-confidence, with many involved in the study stating that is was easier to keep the weight off. In this study, it was entirely down to those involved to decide how much weight they wanted to lose and at what rate. Next, the body takes many years to respond to the change needs it has placed upon it. A recent study (Wing and Hill, 2001) found that the period that it takes for your body to adapt to new diet and exercise regimes is longer that that expected; the chances of long term success of keeping weight lost off also greatly increase after keeping weight off for more than 2 years due to continued adherence to diet and exercise strategies, low levels of depression and dis-inhibition, and medical triggers. This may go some way to explaining the reasons for relapse when the average cycle time for a diet and sustain is 1 year. A study of resting metabolic rate (RMR) by the National Weight Control Registry (Wyatt, 1999) of those who have reduced their weight concluded that in at least some reduced-obese individuals there does not seem to be a permanent obligatory reduction in RMR beyond the expected reduction for a reduced lean mass through rapid dieting. This is supported by additional analyses of resting metabolic rates among formerly obese subjects (Astrup, 1999); this analysis concludes that formerly obese subjects had a 3-5% lower mean relative RMR than control subjects; the difference could be explained by a low RMR being more frequent among the formerly obese subjects than among the control subjects. Whether the cause of the low RMR is genetic or acquired, the existence of a low RMR is likely to contribute to the high rate of weight regain in formerly obese persons. The metabolic rate is known to scale with body mass, which can be broken down into fat-free-mass and fat mass. Studies (Weinsier, Schutz and Bracco, 1992; Cunningham JJ, 1991; Fukagawa et al., 1996) agree that changes to the amount of fat-free-mass a person has directly affects their metabolism but the level which other factors affect metabolism: fat mass (FM), gender, age and hormone levels (Leptin, triiodothyrionine (T3), and thyroxine (T4)) is still not completely understood. A study by the American Society for Clinical Nutrition (Johnstone et al., 2005) investigated the effects of these secondary factors, concluding that both FFM and FM are significant contributors to the basal metabolic rate. However, it also found that leptin, gender and T3 levels are not statistically significant in determining the BMR. One important factor to consider is the research conducted as part of the Minnesota Starvation Experiment (Keys and Drummond, 1950). A follow up study published in the American Journal for Clinical Nutrition re-created the MSE but in an improved environment, utilising the Biosphere facility to investigate if the findings of the MSE, that during starvation the body drastically changes its metabolism, were accurate. The results of this study (Weyer et al., 2000) were that six months after exit and return to a normal diet, body weight had increased to pre-entry levels; however, adjusted metabolism was still significantly lower than in control subjects. The study by Weyer et al. concluded that in lean humans metabolism adaptively decreases to account for “Starvation Mode” and in response to sustained (>5 years) energy restriction. On average, those involved in the biosphere study lost 15% of body mass on a nutritionally rich diet which points to fat-mass (FM) being lost and not significantly lowered levels of fat-free-mass (FFM). However, it is also worth noting that the average change described to BMR was 180kcal, broken down by the study to indicate that the reduction attributed to changes in FM and FFM were equal to those attributed from a reduction in fidgeting. (~60kcal ea.) Effect of Exercise on Changing Metabolism Strength training has shown, especially for men, to contribute to a rapid improvement in RMR (resting metabolic rate) (LEMMER et al., 2001). An earlier study of 50-65-yr-old men also agrees with these findings that the BMR can be improved with resistance exercise (Pratley, 1994). A 2001 review concludes that “More recent research demonstrates that resistance training may positively affect risk factors such as … resting metabolic rate … which are associated with diabetes, heart disease, and cancer” (Winett and Carpinelli, 2001). In addition to the findings that resistance exercise improves RMR, cardiovascular training has shown to be effective at maintaining weight loss (Pollock et al., 1998). However, other analysis of TBL show indicate that exercise alone would not have a significant impact on RMR compared to that of changes to diet, an analysis of the show simulated that exercise alone was predicted to decrease RMR by only 1% versus baseline whereas dietary changes alone was predicted to suppress RMR by 25%. Conclusions (TL;DR) Examining "The Biggest Loser" (TBL) it is clear that the contestants are taking part in a weight loss exercise program that makes it harder to maintain long term. The detrimental physiological and physical impact on the contestant’s bodies sets them up for long term failure. This matches the 6 month re-test data that was gathered on the RMR and weight of those who took part. Studies have found that by completing a doctor-recommended weight loss regime that is driven by the individual (as observed in the national weight control registry) that sustained weight loss/lost is more likely to prevail. Pairing a sensible weight-loss/maintenance program with resistance exercise can help the body in bringing the BMR back to normal levels for a person’s build following a diet, provided that there has not been significant fat-free mass (FFM) lost. TBL's target market is those who subscribe to the “all-or-nothing” principle of dieting that became popular after the millennium. With contestants providing entertainment through their extreme ‘journey’ viewers are sucked in to watching the show. One can assume If the weight loss was 0.5kg per week with 1 hour of exercise per day, instead of its current format, many would not tune in. TBL feeds the growing trend of “fad diets” which promise huge results in very little time, often misrepresenting facts to sell a product or service to appeal to modern expectations of immediate gratification. For real, sustainable long-term weight loss the conclusion is a simple one. Sensible weight loss targets combined with a mild 10-20% calorific deficit and regular varied exercise will lead to sustained weight loss; post-diet, balancing exercise and diet will lead to an easy weight sustain.
