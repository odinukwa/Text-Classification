There is a more geometric way to explain Felipe's answer. To compute the degree of a closed subvariety $Y$ of projective space, of dimension $n$ say, you intersect it with $n$ different hyperplanes in sufficiently general position (with respect to each other and also with respect to $Y$), so that the result is a collection of points, and you add up the number of points. This is the degree of $Y$. In other words, degree has three properties that serve to define it: (a) it is additive with respect to unions (EDIT: of distinct varieties of the same dimension, say, to avoid scheme-theoretic issues). (b) the degree of a point is one. (c) degree is preserved by taking sufficiently general hyperplane sections. (I could omit the caveat sufficiently general here is I was willing to work with scheme structures, and not just varieties). (It is then an exercise, using these conditions, to relate the degree as defined this way to the degree defined via the Hilbert polynomial.) Now if $Y$ is the image of $X$ under the emdedding given by $|m A|$, then the intersection of a hyperplane with $Y$ pulls back, under the isomorphism $X \buildrel \sim \over \to Y$, to a member of the linear system $|m A|.$ (This is by the very definition of the embedding given by $|m A|$.) When you intersect $n$ such divisors, the number of points you get is then (m A)^n. (Because intersection is invariant under deformation of the cycles being intersected, you can replace all the divisors by the linearly equivalent divisor $m A$.) 

One has the finite flat group scheme $\mathbb Z/p$ over $\mathcal O_{K_{\mathfrak p}}$ (I write $K_{\mathfrak p}$ for the $\mathfrak p$-adic completion of $K$, and $\mathcal O_{K_{\mathfrak p}}$ for its integer ring), as well as the finite flat group scheme $A[p]$. Giving a $p$-torsion point over $K_{\mathfrak p}$ (and hence in particular over $K$) is the same as giving a closed embedding on generic fibres: $(\mathbb Z/p)\_{/ K_{\mathfrak p}} \hookrightarrow A[p]\_{/K_{\mathfrak p}}.$ Raynaud's results imply that this extends to a closed embedding over $\mathcal O_K$: $\mathbb Z/p \hookrightarrow A[p],$ which is another way of saying the that the non-zero $p$-torsion point has non-zero reduction. Just to see concretely what can happen in the situation when $e \geq p-1$, suppose that $K = \mathbb Q$ and $p = 2$. Then we could have a map $(\mathbb Z/2)\_{/\mathbb Q_2} \hookrightarrow A[2]_{/\mathbb Q_2}$ which extends to a closed immersion $\mu_2 \hookrightarrow A[2].$ This would correspond to having a 2-torsion point in the kernel of the reduction map. (Note that $\mu_2$ has a non-trivial point in char. zero, which collapses down to the identity in char. two.) [Added in response to unkwown's comment:] The point is that one can form the scheme-theoretic closure in $A[p]$ of the image of $(\mathbb Z/p)\_K,$ which is some finite flat subgroup scheme over $\mathcal O_K$ which is embedding as a closed subgroup scheme of $A[p]$ (by construction: we formed it as a scheme-theoretic closure). And it has $(\mathbb Z/p)\_K$ as its generic fibre (again by construction). Now when $e < p-1$, Raynaud's results show that this finite flat group scheme has no choice but to be $\mathbb Z/p$, and so we get a copy of $\mathbb Z/p$ embedding into $A[p]$, extending the original embedding of generic fibres. Thus the order $p$ point in $A[p](K)$ reduces mod $p$ to an order $p$ point. But if e.g. $p = 2$, then this scheme-theoretic closure could be $\mu_2$. Now the non-trivial point ($-1$) of $\mu_2(K)$ specializes to the trivial point in char. 2, and so when we have a copy of $\mu_2$ inside $A[2]$, the non-trivial point of $\mu_2(K)$ lies in the kernel of the reduction mod 2 map. 

Here is a complete proof: as remarked in the answer by Norondion, we can reduce to the case when $C\_1 \rightarrow C\_2$ is generically separable, i.e. $k(C\_1)$ is separable over $k(C\_2)$. Let $A \subset k(C\_1)$ be a finite type $k$-algebra consisting of the regular functions on some non-empty affine open subset $U$ of $C\_2$ (it doesn't matter which one you choose), so that $k(C\_2)$ is the fraction field of $A$. By the primitive element theorem, we may write $k(C\_1) = k(C\_2)[\alpha]$, where $\alpha$ satisfies some polynomial $f(\alpha) = \alpha^n + a_{n-1}\alpha^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 \alpha + a_0 = 0,$ for some $a_i$ in $K(C\_2)$. Now the $a_i$ can be written as fractions involving elements of $A$, i.e. each $a_i = b_i/c_i$ for some $b_i,c_i \in A$ (with $c_i$ non-zero). We may replace $A$ by $A[c\_0^{-1},\ldots,c\_{n-1}^{-1}]$ (this corresponds to puncturing $U$ at the zeroes of the $c_i$), and thus assume that in fact the $a_i$ lie in $A$. The ring $A[\alpha]$ is now integral over $A$, and of course has fraction field equal to $k(C_2)[\alpha] = k(C_1)$. It need not be that $A[\alpha]$ is integrally closed, though. We are going to shrink $U$ further so we can be sure of this. By separability of $k(C_1)$ over $k(C_2)$, we know that the discriminant $\Delta$ of $f$ is non-zero, and so replacing $A$ by $A[\Delta^{-1}]$ (i.e. shrinking $U$ some more) we may assume that $\Delta$ is invertible in $A$ as well. It's now not hard to prove that $A[\alpha]$ is integrally closed over $A$. Thus $\text{Spec }A[\alpha]$ is the preimage of $U$ in $C_1$ (in a map of smooth curves, taking preimages of an affine open precisely corresponds to taking the integral closure of the corresponding ring). In other words, restricted to $U \subset C_2$, the map has the form $\text{Spec }A[\alpha] \rightarrow \text{Spec }A,$ or, what is the same, $\text{Spec }A[x]/(f(x)) \rightarrow \text{Spec A}$. Now if you fix a closed point $\mathfrak m \in \text{Spec }A,$ the fibre over this point is equal to $\text{Spec }(A/\mathfrak m)[x]/(\overline{f}(x)) = k[x]/(\overline{f}(x)),$ where here $\overline{f}$ denotes the reduction of $f$ mod $\mathfrak m$. (Here is where we use that $k$ is algebraically closed, to deduce that $A/\mathfrak m = k,$ and not some finite extension of $k$.) Now we arranged for $\Delta$ to be in $A^{\times}$, and so $\bar{\Delta}$ (the reduction of $\Delta$ mod $\mathfrak m$, or equivalently, the discriminant of $\bar{f}$) is non-zero, and so $k[x]/(\bar{f}(x))$ is just a product of copies of $k$, as many as equal to the degree of $f$, which equals the degree of $k(C_1)$ over $k(C_2)$. Thus $\text{Spec }k[x]/(\bar{f}(x))$ is a union of that many points, which is what we wanted to show. 

I believe that the answer is yes, and that this may have been one of Grothendieck's motivations for developing the general theory of flat descent. (If I remember correctly, in the first (?) expose of FGA, in which he explains flat descent, Grothendieck has a reference to work of Cartier involving descent in the context of inseparable extensions, and I would guess that it is a reference to this Cartier, or Frobenius, descent. Can anyone cofirm this?) To put a connection on $E$ is to extend the action of $\mathcal O_X$ to an action of $\mathcal D_X$, the ring of differential operators generated (in local coordinates) by $\partial /\partial x_1,\ldots,\partial/\partial x_n.$ (This is not the same as the full ring of differential operators in charateristic $p$.) The $p$-curvatures generate an ideal in this ring; I think it is just the ideal generated by $(\partial/\partial x_i)^p$. So if $E$ has vanishing $p$-curvature, the action of $\mathcal D_X$ factors through the quotient by this ideal. One can now interpret this information in terms of descent data. A precise description is given in Prop. 2.6.2 of Berthelot's book D-modules arithmetiques II; Descente par Frobenius. 

Let $f = t x^2 + y^3 + t^3$ be the equation of the elliptic curve, so that your hypersurface has equation $z^5 = t^2 f$. When you have an equation between monomials like this, there are always some elements of the normalization that are easy to write down. In this case, one has the element $w := z^3/t$. Note that $w^2 = z f$ (which shows that $w$ lie in the normalization) and $w^5 = t f^3$. If I'm not miscalculating, this shows that by adjoining the element $w$, you make your surface non-singular everywhere where $f \neq 0$, and it was already non-zero already in the region $t \neq 0$, so adjoining $w$ is enough to cut down the singular locus to the intersection of $f = 0$ and $t= 0$. Unfortunately, I'm not practiced enough at these kinds of computations to go further. 

Obivously, if the Hilbert class field $H$ of $K$ is abelian over $\mathbb Q$, then $K$ (which is a subfield of $H$) must be abelian over $\mathbb Q$. So suppose that this is the case. In general, there is then a maximal subfield of $H$ that is abelian over $\mathbb Q$; call it $F$. It certainly contains $K$, and is called the genus field of $K$. By class field theory $Gal(F/K)$ is a quotient of the class group $Cl(K)$ of $K$. Which quotient? At least when $Gal(K/\mathbb Q)$ is cyclic, it is the maximal quotient on which $Gal(K/\mathbb Q)$ acts trivially. If $K$ is quadratic then $Gal(K/\mathbb Q)$ acts on $Cl(K)$ by inversion, so $F/K$ corresponds to the maximal 2-elementary abelian quotient of $Cl(K)$. In particular, in this case $F = H$ if and only if $Cl(K)$ is an elementary abelian 2-group. (E.g. $\mathbb Q(\sqrt{-5})$, whose class group is of order 2.) 

Here is a sketch of an argument which directly uses simple connectedness of $\mathbb P^1$, and is related to the simple connectedness of rationally connected smooth varieties mentioned by Sandor in one of his answers. The idea is to treat the $\mathbb P^1$s in $\mathbb P^n$ as analogous to arcs in a topological space, and to make a lifting argument (just as one does in the basic topological theory of covering spaces). Let $Y \to \mathbb P^n$ be a finite etale map. Fix a base points $x \in \mathbb P^n$ and a point $y \in Y$ lying over $X$. If $x' \in \mathbb P^n \setminus \{x\}$, there is a unique line $L$ joining $x$ and $x'$. The preimage of $L$ is a disjoint union of curves $L'$, each mapping isomorphically to $L$ (by simple connectedness of $\mathbb P^1$), and we can choose a unique $L'$ containing $y$. Now let $y'$ be the point of $L'$ lying over $x'$. The map $x' \mapsto y'$ (and of course mapping our original point $x$ to $y$) gives a section to the given map $Y\to \mathbb P^n$, which is what we wanted. Added: Here is one explanation of why the map $x' \mapsto y'$ is algebraic. Let $\pi:Y \to \mathbb P^n$ be our given etale map. First note that $x' \mapsto \pi^{-1}(L)$ (where $L$ is the line joining $x$ and $x'$, as above) is a morphism from $\mathbb P^n \setminus \{x\}$ to the Hilbert scheme of $Y$. Now picking out the connected component $L'$ of $\pi^{-1}(x')$ containing $y$ is a morphism from our given locally closed subset of the Hilbert scheme to the Hilbert scheme, and so altogether we see that $x' \mapsto L'$ is a morphism. Finally, mapping $L'$ to $x'$ (which can be described as forming the intersection $L' \cap \pi^{-1}(x')$) is again a morphism. So altogether we have a section $\mathbb P^n \setminus\{x\} \to Y$. One way to show that this extends as a section over all of $\mathbb P^n$ (by sending $x$ to $y$) is just to repeat the whole process for a different choice of $x$, and glue the two resulting sections. 

One heuristic is the following: if one imagines that the residue at $s = 1$ of the $\zeta$-function doesn't grow too rapidly, then the value is a combination of the regulator and the class number. I don't know any reason for the regulator not to also grow (there are a lot of units, after all!), and hence one can imagine that the class number then stays small. This is part of a general heuristic that in random number fields there tends to be a trade-off between units and class number, so especially in the totally real case, when there are so many units, the class number should often be 1. I learnt some of these heuristics from a colleague of mine who regards it more-or-less as an axiom that a random number field has very small class number. I think this view was formed through a mixture of back-of-the-envelope ideas of the type described above, together with a lot of experience computing with random number fields. So the answer to your question might be that it is a mixture of heuristics and computations. Incidentally, in the real quadratic case, it is compatible with Cohen--Lenstra, but I think it goes back to Gauss. Also, there are generalizations of Cohen--Lenstra to the higher degree context, and I'm pretty sure that they are compatible with the class group/unit group trade-off heuristic described above. 

In $SU(n+1)/U(n)$ there is a natural basepoint, the coset of the identity, which is fixed by the action of $U(n)$ (thought of as acting on the quotient by virtue of being a subgroup of $SU(n1)$). Since $U(n)$ fixed this point, it acts on the (complexified) cotangent space to this point, and the problem is then to understand this representation, and in particular, to decompose it into two pieces, the $(1,0)$ piece and the $(0,1)$ piece. Now the tangent space is ${\mathfrak su}(n+1)/{\mathfrak u(n)}$ (here I mean complexified Lie algebras), and so we have to decompose this quotient under the adjoint action of $U(n)$. It has dimension $(n+1)^2-1-n^2 = 2n,$ and in fact it will decompose as the sum of the standard representation of $U(n)$ direct sum its dual (or equivalently, its complex conjugate). One of these representations will give the $(1,0)$-subbundle of the tangent bundle, and the other the $(0,1)$-subbundle. Dualizing (to pass from tangent to cotanget) will give your answer. (I am not going to actually stipulate which is which, just because I'm likely to blunder while tracing through the constructions and the duality; but it shouldn't be hard to work out if you sit down with pen and paper.) [The following is added in response to the comment below, asking for the movitation behind the above calculation; hopefully it is of some help:] Since we are looking for an $SU(n+1)$-equivariant splitting of the (co)tangent bundle, it is enough to look for a $U(n)$-equivariant splitting of its fibre at the $U(n)$-fixed point. (This is a manifestation of the very reason that $U(n)$-reps. give rise to equivariant bundles on the quotient.) At that fixed point (the identity coset) the tangent space is ${\mathfrak su(n+1)}/{\mathfrak u(n)}$, just because it is the quotient of the tangent spaces at the identity of the corresponding groups. Since this has to split into two complex conjugate halves under the $U(n)$ action (we know that is breaks up into a $(1,0)$ and $(0,1)$ part), each of dimension $n$, it's not hard to guess what they must be. A little computation in the Lie algebra ${\mathfrak su(n+1)}$ confirms the guess. Maybe a general lesson to be drawn is: when trying to compute a $G$-equivariant bundle on $G/H$, it is enough to compute the $H$-representation on the fibre at the identity coset; indeed, passing from $G$-equivariant bundles to this fibre is the quasi-inverse functor to the one (implicitly) alluded to in the introduction, which associates a $G$-equivariant bundle to an $H$-representation. [The following was added in response to the question about equivariance and transition functions in the comments:] Dear Dyke, Let me hide behind Ben's answer, and leave the expression of equivariance in terms of transition functions as an exercise. (Note that, while it is in some sense routine, as Ben indicates, it may also be painful, because if $G$ acts transitively, as in your example, then you won't be able to choose the affine opens on which the bundle is trivialized to be $G$-invariant, and this will complicate things.) Instead, I'll note the following: when you describe a vector bundle by transition functions, you are giving a bunch of open sets that you glue together to get your space, and then the transition functions tell you how to glue together the trivial bundle on these various opens into a bundle on the space under consideration. But the $G$-equivariant set-up gives a different way to think of the bundle: on $G/H$, since $G$ acts transitively, we just take the trivial bundle at the base point, and then move it around by $G$ to get a bundle over all of $G/H$. The only thing is that this is overdetermined (unless $H$ is trivial); there are lots of ways to go via an element in $G$ to a given point. This overdeterminacy is all encoded in the fact that $H$ stabilizes the base-point: so what we have to do is say, if we take our vector space at the base-point, and then move it around by an element $h \in H$ (which doesn't actually move the base-point at all), how we identify the ``moved space'' with the original space. In other words (making this heuristic precise) we have to describe an $H$-action on the vector space at the base-point. Ergo, $H$-representations correspond to $G$-equivariant vector bundles on $G/H$. So in this context, transition functions are not a very natural way to think about how the vector bundle is constructed; a more representation-theoretic view-point is the way to go.
