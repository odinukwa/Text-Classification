This makes immediately clear why A⇒□A is valid in Kripke modal logic, while □A⇒A is not; if A is a theorem (and our logical system is sound), this means that 

Whether or not the coin has been tossed, the probability is just a model of how you expect events to turn out, or to have turned out, based on the information you have. Without having information about the result of the coin, it does not matter whether or not it has been flipped yet. The probabilistic model which assigns probabilities based on different amounts of information remains the same, and so is agnostic of time, in the same way that Newton's equations predict the same behaviour for an apple that is dropped from a height of 1m in similar conditions both for yesterday and tomorrow. Probabilities are best assigned relative to one's experience of the world. In the Sleeping Beauty problem, the princess' experience of the world is biased by the sleeping drug. Although an undrugged observer may experience the coin as being fair, Sleeping Beauty's experience of the frequencies of the coin are different. At issue is the fact that Sleeping Beauty experiences the events of and with different frequencies relative to a control observer. Without additional information, Sleeping Beauty could rationally assign different probabilities to the outcomes of the coin, because we are deliberately skewing her experiences. Furthermore, while Sleeping Beauty knows we are skewing her experiences, this does not affect the experiences she will have as a result of the skewing. She could rationally infer that we perceive the coin to be fair, and also that she would perceive the coin to be unfair. Thus, even before engaging in the experiment she could assign a prior probability of 1/3 to , at least for her own purposes. Sleeping Beauty simply experiences a different probabilistic ensemble to ourselves, and so obtains a different frequency, in a manner not totally different to how different observers moving at different speeds will perceive sounds to be at different pitches due to the Doppler Effect. And similarly to shifting pitches of sounds, we can obtain a unifying probabilistic model, which does not assign a definite probability to the event , but which describes what probability each agent could rationally ascribe to the event depending on what ensemble their conscious experiences will be subject to. 

while your premises are essentially statements of fact about the same issue, not asking whether life is inviolate or not, or whether different stages of fetus are life or not, or whether life's inviolate-ness trumps a woman's choice, or not. In the last line of your final question, this premise/conclusion is directly stated: "the only real issue on the table: life". You did write in your third paragraph "if a foetus doesn't yet count as life, then no such rules apply." but you don't ever address that issue after that. You also don't address the other non-premise questions I mentioned in the above paragraph. So sure, if your premise is right that killing fetuses is always wrong and "the only real issue on the table", then you are right... that that is your premise. 

The similarity to circular reasoning is, I think, in the cycle of conditions.† The classic example is drawn from the novel Catch-22, with respect to Orr being allowed not to fly anymore in the Allied campaign in Italy during WWII. Without commenting on whether or not these premises are valid propositions in themselves, the structure of that Catch-22 is as follows: Orr will only be relieved of pilot duty if he is crazy; but if he were crazy, he wouldn't request to be relieved of pilot duty. We may analyse this by: 

When one says "the majority is always wrong", what does one mean by this? Do we mean that the majority is incapable of making perfect decisions (supposing for the moment that it is possible for an external agent to objectively measure the excellence of decisions)? That with universal sufferage, a large portion of people will make their decision based on very badly imperfect information? Or some other criterion? And if they make decisions which are somewhat bad, how do you propose to put into power individuals who, on average, make better decisions? The problem with autocracy, and the modes of gaining power in societies tending to autocracy, is that the only thing that it consistently selects for is aptitude in gaining and retaining power. The only cases where "gaining and retaining power" is beneficial for "a nation" — that is to say (albeit acknowledging my democratic and humanistic bias when I say this) the people living in that country — are when the general well-being and contentedness of the subjects play a significant role in the ability of the dictator to continue to govern. That is to say, in a dictatorship which is weak, and which must accomodate the masses, or fall to a coup d'état. A democratic form of government is the logical (and also the historical) progression of governments being forced to accomodate the wishes of the citizenry. You could, of course, remark that the main selection pressure for career politicians in a democracy is also their ability to obtain and retain power. The question is then: what is necessary for them to do so? Different democratic systems have many failings, but the worst of them — suceptibility to lobbyists or commercial interests, being prone to personal conflicts of interest, and so forth — not only apply to officers in a dictatorhsip as well, but are the sort of problem that we would categorize as corruption, that is to say, a failing to attain the intended standards of the system. A benign, honest, and strong dictatorship is conceivable of course: otherwise you wouldn't have thought to ask the question. However, concievability is not the same as probability, or reliability. Historically, we seem to find the conditions for a strong dictatorship to be benign rather... rare. Furthermore, "benign" does not entail "well-informed", any more than "popular" does: a ruler who is well-meaning, or even well-informed in some matters, can be badly informed in other matters. For certain ethical and moral priorities, such as those espoused during the enlightenment in Europe — freedom of movement and settlement, freedom of speech, and so forth — a democratic form of government is the best general scheme that we have found to enact those priorities. This is not to say that these forms of government are perfect for achieving important objectives (such as, perhaps, ensuring the integrity of the environment), but we have no experience with any other form of government which is more reliable for meeting those objectives; and (to make a rather bland understatement) dictatorships have an extremely spotty record for achieving them. 

I agree that these are all problems where you have multiple people with different life prospects and chances of survival and resources to consider. However in this case I don't follow what you are saying about the fetus. It does seem to me that it would be relevant how important you considered the fetus' status to be. 

Again this is a complex scenario that doesn't have one answer from logic, but I wouldn't disagree that limited resources need to be allocated, and it makes sense to have a "disinterested expert" select - although the criteria are again going to have to be chosen, probably based on some grey areas. This is an interesting example though because here you have two different families facing death competing for limited resource that the medical establishment (and legal system) controls, deciding who is likely to live or die. However in the abortion case, you have a pregnant woman's choice of whether to abort a pregnancy, and are proposing that the legal system declare the fetus as inviolate life and deny her that choice (which risks her own life, in some cases greatly or, in rare cases, even certainly) about her own potential future child and her own life, with no one else involved. And there is also the situation to consider that the result of illegalizing abortion is not the prevention of abortion, but causing women to get dangerous black market (or improvised) abortions instead. 

This is an excellent question. There is no reason why group homes for old people ought avoid similar disrepute as group homes for children -- abuse, neglect, and a thousand other human evils are certainly visited upon some of those people, too. Maybe we just care about old people less. Babies and children are cute and seem to have promise, whereas old people, well, I think we (as a society) often just wish they would die already or otherwise go away. Plato thinks old people who have aged out of the breeding program ought to just be able to enjoy the small pleasures of a life well-lived, at the state's expense. 

My answer would clearly be: no. Hijacking is a loaded word. You don't explain how this argument from adverse consequences would work, but I assume you are suggesting that the pro choice movement is suggesting that a foetus is not inviolate life because unwanted pregnancies have bad effects on women's lives? I don't think I've ever heard anyone argue that, so no. And I don't agree with your premise that the "only real issue on the table" is "life", so no. I think the comment that goldilocks made about this "begging the question" is accurate: you seem to have unquestioned premises that a fetus is "inviolate life", and that that trumps a woman's choice about whether to bear the child or not. All your conclusions on the question of abortion rights seem to just be direct consequences of assuming those premises to be true. If we instead start with a premise that, just to pick another arbitrary example, that the ancient Roman attitude that a child isn't a person yet until a year after birth is instead our premise, then we'd have very different "real issues" and very different conclusions. Postscript: To respond to your comment by explain why I think you're "begging the question" here. I don't mean this ad hominem, or to suggest you're intentionally doing this. Begging the question is where your conclusion is essentially the same as the premise you start with. The questions you stated were: 

The notion of the 'successor' is usually supplied by some axiom scheme such as Peano Arithmetic, in order to assert that there exists the integer zero, and a successor to any integer. Even if we set that aside, how do you propose to obtain an exhaustive search of all of the integers for possible divisors of 3, to ensure that there are exactly two such divisors? In practise, we reduce the search space to the integers 1, 2, and 3, because we may prove that multiplication has certain properties of monotonicity with respect to the total order defined on the integers by extending a < a+1 transitively. This is as much axiomatic as the sort of reasoning that allows us to infer that any finite list of primes is incomplete. Conversely, because we may reason axiomatically to obtain a procedure of bounded length to find the divisors of any positive integer, we can also reason axiomatically to obtain an algorithm which is guaranteed to halt (and with a bound on its running time) for any list of primes a further prime which is not contained in the list. The fact that we cannot demonstrate by exhaustion that every prime is smaller than some prime afterward, is not any more problematic than the fact that we cannot demonstrate by exhaustion that any of the integers larger than three can be a divisor; they are the same sort of statement. Generally, the only reason why any sort of "numerical experiment" could be used to ascertain any facts at all beyond mere existence theorems is because we adopt principles, either axiomatic or intuitive (that is, pre-axiomatic), which allow us to infer certain consequences from an investigation of only a finite search space. For instance, by investigation of a finite search space, we may show that 3 has at least two factors; but to show that it has no more is a universal statement, not an existential one, and so requires axioms which allow us to infer universal statements. And without principles which assert the existence of certain objects, even existence theorems cannot be proven. 

For this to be well-defined, one would need to define "life" and say what "rules" one means, as well as what stages of "foetus". 

It seems to me that there is no one right logical answer to this. It's about culture and moral codes and law and circumstances more than it is about logic. For example, someone might argue that a country that put a mother in such a situation and won't relieve it is at cause in threatening the survival of these children, and a mother put in this situation might be morally justified in considering sacrificing one to save the rest (although one might hope she'd orphan the child rather than kill it, etc). 

1,000,000/1,000,000 stars. It speaks to philosophical ideas like proportionality and beauty. Plus, like, half a dozen other ideas. 

I think the confusion derives from the language(-game?) embedded in the question itself: can something that is limitless be bound by limit? You don't even need to ask the ancillary questions if you can't answer that one. It seems our use of language is already defining-down or hemming in the idea of 'growth without bound' by yoking it to 'somethinghood,' the ontological status of an object, which necessarily has limits. An omnipotent god both can and cannot do all of those things you said since saying a thing 'cannot not' do something is, in fact, imposing a restriction upon omnipotence. "All" is necessarily the union of can and cannot. In fact, I think we probably need to invoke tetralemma here, since infinite can surely bust any law of excluded middle, n'est pas? To talk about the truth of infinite power, we must say that: can, cannot, both can and cannot, neither can or cannot. Mahayana helps. 

I would suggest the opposite: that a pregnant woman is typically the person most interested (and most expert) in the life of the fetus inside them, even in cases where they choose to abort. Expertness and interest are themselves subjective or at least not-clearly-defined terms, as is their degree of relevance. Your "Life and choice matrix" just seems to graphically show the result of your postulates that a fetus is life and that life is inviolate and that the inviolateness of life trumps a woman's choice. 

This makes more sense, although in some (or even many) cases I think this is what is done. That is, there is also a grey area about the definition of life when someone seems to be in a coma, or brain dead, etc., and this does determine transplant decisions. Also, many medical decisions and attitudes are even formed based on how old a healthy person is, and the quality of their remaining expected lifetime, or the chances of them surviving a procedure, and how long and how well they are statistically expected to live after a procedure. These don't define the patient as "not life", but they do affect how much we invest in them, and whether we "let them die" in favor of others, or even just in favor of the time and resources and money of the medical industry. 

By request of , here are my comments unified as an answer — It seems likely to me that such a logic might not exist, or might be too limited. A possible obstacle.    Consider the classic proof by contradiction of the fact that the square-root of 2 is irrational. Let 

One criticism that you might make is that you could always make a model for NBG in some other set theory in which there are no proper classes. (This is essentially what you point out with inaccessible cardinals). Because one can always extend beyond any one model in which there is a largest cardinality, one can say that in the subject of mathematics — not in any one model, but in the discipline as a whole — there is no absolute infinite. But of course, if you do not fix any theory whatsoever, nothing whatsoever can be absolute. Non-standard models of the Peano Axioms subvert our usual notions of the natural numbers, so that we could not even say with any confidence that there is an absolute notion of a natural number. There isn't even an absolute notion of what it means for a cardinality to be infinite, if you allow the changing of models as you like. You can remedy this by fixing some class of set theories you wish to discuss, but this is just fixing some particular theory — a theory of set-theories — in the same way that selecting NBG or ZFC would be fixing a theory; your answer will depend on what theory you fix. In order to give any sort of answer, you must fix your domain of discourse sufficiently to give an answer. So depending on how you want to fix the terms of your question, the answer is either
