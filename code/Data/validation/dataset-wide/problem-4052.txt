The new edition of SGA3 by Philippe Gille et Patrick Polo provides a connected example due to Raynaud. It is in SGA3 Exposé VIA Exemples 1.3.2 (2) and you may find it at $URL$ This example is $2$-dimensional, but it is easy to modify it to get a $1$-dimensional example if the characteristic of the base field is at least $3$. More precisely, let $G$ be defined by the equations $X^p-tY^p=Y^p-tZ^p=0$ in the additive group $\mathbb{G}_a^3$ over the field $\mathbb{F}_p(t)$, $p\neq 2$. Then $G$ is a connected group scheme of dimension $1$ whose reduction is not a subgroup scheme, as may be seen by following step by step the arguments of loc. cit. 

Nice question! Maybe Jacobsthal's function might interest you. If the $a_i$s are all distinct primes, and the $A_i$s are the non-zero residue classes modulo the $a_i$s, the best known bounds for Jacobsthal's function, due to Iwaniec and Vaughan, will definitely help your $k$-variate case. The relevant publications are: H. Iwaniec, On the error term in the linear sieve, Acta Arithmetica 19 (1971), 1--30. R. C. Vaughan, On the order of magnitude of Jacobsthal's function, Proc. Edinburgh Math. Soc. 20 (1976-7), 329--331. 

The density Hales-Jewett theorem implies that there cannot exist perfect magic hypercubes of fixed side length $k$ and arbitrarily high dimension $n$ whose cells are filled with the consecutive numbers $1,2,\dots,k^n$ and for which the numbers in cells along any geometric line sum to the magic constant $\frac{k(k^n+1)}{2}$. For, take the cells with numbers $ 1,2,\dots,\left\lfloor\frac{k^n}{2}\right\rfloor $. This always has density about $1/2$, and so by the density Hales-Jewett theorem, will contain a hyperline for sufficiently large $n$. But no $k$ numbers from this set of density about $1/2$ can ever sum to the magic constant. 

Let $X$ be a projective complex K3 surface whose Néron-Severi-group is generated by two classes $h$ and $l$ such that $h^2=4$, $hl=1$ and $l^2=-2$ and $h$ is ample. One sees that such a surface exists using the surjectivity of the period map for K3 surfaces. General theorems about linear systems on K3 surfaces imply that $h$ is very ample and embeds $X$ in $\mathbb{P}^3$. Since $l^2=-2$, $l$ or $-l$ is effective. Since $hl=1$, it is $l$ that is effective, and it has to be the class of a line in $\mathbb{P}^3$. This line is a $-2$-curve and may be contracted to a node. Let $f:X\to Y$ be this contraction map. Since $Y$ is a singular K3 surface, if it were possible to embed it in $\mathbb{P}^3$, the degree of the embedding would necessarily be $4$, but this is impossible as no line bundle on $Y$ has this degree. 

Nice question! For a point of view from the perspective of Goldbach's conjecture, perhaps one can consider also Theorem 3.7 of "The Hardy-Littlewood Method", 2nd edition, by R.C. Vaughan. 

The following is for a finite board (the question actually assumes an infinite board). For an $N\times N \times N$ board, wouldn't $2N$ rooks suffice? The idea comes from adapting the checkmate with two rooks for the two dimensional case in which the two rooks alternate rows and force the king to the last rank. For the three dimensional case, for each $y$ with $1\leq y \leq N$, place one rook at $(1,y,k)$ and another at $(2,y,k+1)$. Then, for $y$ going from $1$ to $N$, move the rook at $(1,y,k)$ to the square $(1,y,k+2)$. Again, for $y$ going from $1$ to $N$, move the rook at $(2,y,k+1)$ to $(2,y,k+3)$. Each for loop over $y$ involves moving, alternately, the rooks with $x$ coordinate $1$ by increasing their $z$ coordinate by $2$ units, or the rooks with $x$ coordinate $2$ by increasing their $z$ coordinate by $2$ units. We alternate, so that a for loop in which the rooks with $x$ coordinate $1$ are moved is followed by a for loop in which the rooks with $x$ coordinate $2$ are moved, and vice versa. Eventually, either the rooks with $x$ coordinate $1$ or the rooks with $x$ coordinate $2$ will have $z$ coordinate $N$. The effect of this is that a subset of the squares guarded by the rooks form a "floor" of two layers that keeps moving upward. So if the black king is between this "floor" and the top of the $N\times N\times N$ cube, it gets pushed to the top face. The "floor" must be moved upward in such a way that it never becomes disconnected, so that the black king can never escape to beneath the "floor" through some gap. For an infinite board, @Noam Elkies has already mentioned $5N$, so the following is not an improvement: the "ceiling" (and the other walls of the $N\times N \times N$ cube) can be formed by placing $N$ more rooks at $(N,y,N)$, for each $y$ with $1\leq y\leq N$, and $N-1$ more rooks at $(x,1,N)$, for each $x$ with $1 \leq x \leq N-1$, and $N-1$ more rooks at $(x,N,N)$ for each $x$ with $1 \leq x \leq N-1$. 

Olivier Wittenberg and I are curious about the following : Let $S$ be a smooth projective complex surface. Are the self-intersection numbers of integral curves on $S$ always bounded below ? Or can $S$ contain integral curves with arbitrarily high negative self-intersection ? 

Let me explain why the statement is true. Let $i:B\to A$ be an injection of noetherian rings and $\mathfrak{p}$ be an associated prime of $B$ : it is the annihilator of a nonzero element $f\in B$. Let us first localize at $\mathfrak{p}$. More precisely, replacing $B\to A$ by $B_{\mathfrak{p}}\to A\otimes_B B_{\mathfrak{p}}$ , it is possible to assume that $B$ is local with maximal ideal $\mathfrak{p}$. Let $I$ be the ideal of $A$ generated by $i(f)$, viewed as an $A$-module. Since $I\neq 0$ by injectivity of $i$, it has an associated prime $\mathfrak{q}\subset A$. This means that there is $a\in A$ such that $\mathfrak{q}$ is the annihilator of ai(f). Note that $\mathfrak{q}$ is also associated to $A$, and let us check that it has the required properties. As $\mathfrak{p}$ annihilates $f$, $\mathfrak{q}\cap B$ contains $\mathfrak{p}$. Since $\mathfrak{p}$ is maximal, $\mathfrak{q}\cap B=\mathfrak{p}$. 

I apologize in advance if this question is not of sufficient level. Define a perfect magic hypercube of side length $k$ and dimension $n$ to be one in which the cells are filled with consecutive integers and the sum of numbers over cells in any geometric line is equal to the appropriate constant depending on $n$ and $k$. From the density Hales-Jewett theorem it follows that for fixed $k$, there cannot exist perfect magic hypercubes of fixed side length $k$ and arbitrarily large $n$. My question is: what are simpler ways to prove the nonexistence of perfect magic hypercubes of fixed $k$ and arbitrarily large $n$? Thanks very much. 

Let me give a counter-example, where $f$ is moreover proper (see Piotr Achinger's comment), but $Y$ is not normal. Let $X$ be the affine plane over a field $k$ and let $\tilde{Y}$ be the blow-up of the origin in $X$. We choose two $k$-points $P_1$ and $P_2$ on the exceptional divisor, and consider the variety $Y$ constructed by gluing $P_1$ and $P_2$ transversally. There is an induced proper and birational morphism $f:Y\to X$, and the contraction $c:\tilde{Y}\to Y$ is nothing else than the normalization of $Y$. Moreover, we have the following exact sequence on $Y$: $$0\to\mathcal{O}_Y\to c_*\mathcal{O}_{\tilde{Y}}\to\mathcal{O}_P\to 0,$$ where we denoted by $P$ the common image of $P_1$ and $P_2$ in $Y$, and where the last arrow is given by the difference of evaluations at $P_1$ and $P_2$. We get a long exact sequence in cohomology (here we use that, the cohomology of $c_*\mathcal{O}_{\tilde{Y}}$ coincides with the cohomology of $\mathcal{O}_{\tilde{Y}}$ because $c$ is finite, and that $H^1(\tilde{Y},\mathcal{O}_\tilde{Y})=0$): $$0\to H^0(Y,\mathcal{O}_Y)\to H^0(\tilde{Y},\mathcal{O}_\tilde{Y})\to H^0(P,\mathcal{O}_P)\to H^1(Y,\mathcal{O}_Y)\to 0.$$ Every global function on $\tilde{Y}$ is constant on the exceptional divisor (as it is proper and integral), and hence descends to $Y$ showing that the first map is an isomorphism. As a consequence, $H^0(P,\mathcal{O}_P)\to H^1(Y,\mathcal{O}_Y)$ is an isomorphism, and $H^1(Y,\mathcal{O}_Y)$ is nonzero. 

Just a two cents worth here. :) Chess itself might perhaps not be too mathematical, but the chess evaluation functions of any chess-playing computer program seems like a mathematical object. After all, these are maps from the set of chess positions to $\mathbb{R}$ and they are bound to satisfy various properties. Given any two chess programs that are both strong and might be expected to be decent (in terms of current technology) approximations to objective truth, one might probably expect them to be "close" in some meaningful way that one could perhaps attempt to define. 

The description of the Hilbert scheme of complete intersections (obtained by taking in an iterative way open subsets of grassmannian bundles, as explained in the answer above) may be found in part 2.2 of my thesis $URL$ If the distinct degrees are $\delta_1<\dots<\delta_r$, at the $i$-th step you construct a grassmannian bundle corresponding to choosing the equations of degree $\delta_i$ up to multiples of the equations of lower degree, and you remove the closed locus where your equations do not define a complete intersection. Note that this space is smooth. It is not complete unless $k=1$. However, the construction above provides an explicit compactification if $d_1\leq d_2=\dots=d_k$. This compactification is studied in part 2 of arXiv:1111.1589. The Picard group of this Hilbert scheme is easy to describe (its rank increases by one with each grassmannian bundle and it is not changed when removing the small closed loci).The class of the discriminant in this Picard group (i.e. the degrees of the discriminant) is calculated in arXiv:1009.0704 Théorème 1.3, building on Gel'fand, Kapranov and Zelevinsky's work. 

Hi there, If you're only interested in heuristics, then if you replace $89$ by $x$, fix $m$ and $n$, fix $\pm$ to be $+$ or $-$, fix one of $a,b$ to be $2$, and let the other variable range over primes less than $x$, then it is in the right form for the Bateman-Horn conjecture to be applied to. See for example, P. T. Bateman, R. A. Horn, A heuristic asymptotic formula concerning the distribution of prime numbers, Mathematics of Computation 16 (1962), 363--367. (Say $a=2$, $b$ ranges over primes less than $x$, $m$ and $n$ are fixed, and $\pm$ is $+$. Then one can use the case of Bateman-Horn for two polynomials simultaneously, one polynomial being $z$, the other one being $z^n+2^m$.) Then depending on which other variables you want to vary, you can apply Bateman-Horn to each case like this. Don't know how accurate it would be for $x=89$ ! But it should be more accurate for $x \rightarrow \infty$. The usual caveat about this still being a conjecture applies.
