As a rule no, while sulfur and nitrogen compounds from industrial and vehicle exhaust have an immediate impact and a relatively fast deposition cycle and thus are extremely location sensitive carbon dioxide is relatively long lived in the atmosphere and too plentiful in discharge to be heavily effected by the environment of discharge, assuming direct atmospheric discharge. If you pumped carbon dioxide discharge into water instead of the air then the atmospheric concentrations would be greatly effected by location, specifically temperature and algal uptake rates. 

These are identifiers that can indicate advance or retreat, either current or historic, but at a glance there are no definitive signs of any long-term trend in the glaciers' behaviour. This is chiefly because glaciers advance and retreat on a seasonal basis so a particular feature may be the product of one winter of heavy snow (some years ago) or one very hot summer. 

Could be Jet which is a mineralised form of coal, it also reminds me of several pieces of salt mineralised charcoal I have that I found on beaches in New Zealand. 

I can't be definite but my three best guesses are Travertine, Agate and maybe Halite, if it fizzes in mild acid it's Travertine, a form of Limestone, if it dissolves in hot water it's Halite, or Rocksalt, otherwise if it's more or less inert it's probably Agate, an amorphous silicate. I find Halite unlikely, the other two are probably pretty equally likely in that location. 

The first thing to note here is that the zircons you mention in your question are the only thing we have dating from the Hadean: no known Hadean continental or oceanic crust have been found to date. So, all informations come from these zircons. What do they tell us? The rare earth element (REE) composition of these zircons (and in particular the zoning of said REE inside the mineral) suggests that they formed in a magma derived from the melting of a continental crust (Wilde et al. 2001). Their high $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$ composition also indicates that the magma was at some point in contact with liquid water (also Wilde et al. 2001): both continents and oceans were present in the Hadean. The presence of liquid water already implies cooler temperature than what was previously thought (Valley et al. 2002). With regards to climate per say, the Lithium composition (high concentration, light isotopes) of the zircons (Ushikobo et al. 2008) have been interpreted as evidence of an intense chemical continental weathering. This weathering could have several explanations but one possibility retained by Ushikobo et al. 2008 (see also Sleep 2010) is a CO2-rich atmosphere with surface temperatures above 50°C. 

Best guess based on texture more than anything else is Chert, we have a lot of honey coloured chert in my neck of the woods but I'm not sure if it's as common in the north hemisphere. 

Surprisingly enough most of the figures I could find were actually about thermal output but back working the figures, and assuming I read the formulas properly (not guaranteed I'm afraid) it looks like 5-7 litres per second is the ballpark average gas flow based on fifty years worth of data from several fumarole fields in the central North Island of New Zealand. I have no idea how representative that figure would be of fields elsewhere. 

I would have expected to find something here but there isn't a guide to ceramics there that I can find. This article and it's references may give you some guidance though. Found a limited table in this that will probably help too. 

1 part per billion is 1x10^-9 kilograms per kilogram so to convert a kilogram per kilogram ratio into a parts per billion figure divide it by 1x10^-9. 

It looks, to me, like nothing so much as polished Mookaite, that is agatised coral, mostly found in Australia, the various lines through it are actually coral growth-rings fossilised by silica saturated ground water. 

As a preamble, let me say that I don't know remotely enough on galactic dynamic to know if a supernova could have possibly been close enough during the Ordovician for Earth to be affected by a gamma ray burst, nor do I know enough about geochemistry to know if there are ways to detect such an event in the fossil record. That being said, the questions that I'll try to answer are: do we need to invoke an extraterrestrial event to explain the Late Ordovician glaciation? does the taxa selectivity of the extinction event support the GRB hypothesis? So let's look at the different hypotheses on how the glaciation occurred, the original conundrum being: how could a glaciation occur when mid-Ordovician $p_{CO_2}$ is believed to be up to 14 times Quaternary level? Brenchley et al. 1994 suggested that the Ordovician ocean circulation changed from a system having warm saline bottom waters to a system with cold bottom waters (i. e. a thermohaline instead of an haline circulation), which triggered a phytoplanktonic bloom, which then decreased atmospheric $p_{CO_2}$ and provoked an eutrophization of the ocean. Kump et al. 1999 argued in favor of a tectonically derived $p_{CO_2}$ decline: with the Appalachian and Caledonides orogenesis came an increased weathering which decreased $p_{CO_2}$. Of course the two hypotheses are not mutually exclusive since increased weathering also means increasing nutrients in seawater and therefore increasing primary productivity. Another question is which groups went extinct during the glaciation: recent studies show that acritarchs (the most diverse group of phytoplankton known for that period) did not suffer from these events (Vecoli 2008); oppositely benthic group such as crinoids or brachiopods did (see Sheehan 2001 for a review); some pelagics groups such as graptolites and nautiloids did suffer as well during the event while some other didn't (radiolarians for instance). In summary there is no clear pattern, but there is also no reason to think that there was a preferential extinction of surface organisms over deeper-living ones. So, does that answer the question: no; but it seems to me that GRB doesn't explain better the event that unfolded during the late Ordovician than other hypotheses (namely the ocean eutrophization and the continental weathering). Does it discard the hypothesis of a GRB: no; but since there is no direct evidence that it indeed happened at that time, and that we can explain the Ordovician events without, it seems, to me, more parsimonious to think that it didn't.

Okay have a look at this article it may be some use, it's the Journal of GeoEngineering, Vol. 8, No. 1 April 2013 Pgs 27-32 so you may be able to get a hard copy if the link fails, it talks about clay core dams and seepage calculations thereof, including phreatic pathway estimation. If I remember correctly rock fill in earth dams is treated as earth for the purposes of working out seepage lines etc... as it is generally small enough (particle size), relative to the dam as a whole, to have little or no effect on total mean permeability. 

There are a number of publicly available proxy records for sea-level/temperature curves, I'd start with Google Scholar if you want refereed articles but a straight Google search can give you good results if you use the right search terms, like "sea-level over time" gave me some useful results; I'd recommend the Wikipedia result as most useful to you. 

Given that it's a quarry then at a guess the grass is growing over areas that are cut into the bedrock more deeply than the non-grassed areas, this means that there is a trench that holds a little more soil and water than the relatively bare rock outside of the cuts like a cropmark but smaller and more extreme. 

Macrostrat is (or in fact will be) what you are looking for I think. This database is still in development and is apparently only available through the website as a beta so far. It only seems to cover the US, Australia and New Zealand to this date but you can search for specific formations. From your example, here is a screenshot of the result I had while looking for surface outcrops of halite: 

You can find gridded topography and bathymetry data, freely accessible, on the website of the NOAA. For instance you have the ETOPO1 dataset here. Once you downloaded it you can work it out with your favourite GIS software or GIS-supporting programming language. The equations to calculate the volume based on the gridded cells is given on this page from the NGDC website. 

From reading the literature on the subject, my impression is that we don't know that much on the subject, primarily due to a scarcity of measurements. My understanding is that the first and only year-long time-series was made at the Drake Passage in 1979 (e. g. Whitworth & Peterson, 1985) by the ISOS programme (International Southern Ocean Studies). In addition to that NOAA's WOCE (World Ocean Circulation Experiment) added yearly data from 1990 to 2002. According to Rintoul & Sokolov 2001 and Rintoul et al. 2001, most of the variability south of Tasmania is due to changes in currents north of the ACC itself. Cunningham et al. 2003 show that the moderate interannual variation in baroclinic transport they observed seem to be coeval with variations in the location of the Polar Front (it moves north or south on a 90km range). But overall the variability seems to be relatively low, and the ACC relatively steady. White & Peterson, 1996 showed an interesting phenomenon that they called the Antarctic Circumpolar Wave: it is a "wave" in the ACC circling the globe in ca. 8 yrs with a period of 4yrs at any location and it is defined by anomalies in sea-suface temperature, sea-level pressure and sea-ice extent. However no evidence for corresponding anomalies in volume transport was showed, to my knowledge. So, to summarize, as far as I can see: 

Given the preponderance of young volcanic rocks in your part of the world I'd be inclined to go with Ignimbrite as my first guess. The picture you have supplied looks almost identical to samples I have at home of welded ignimbrites from the Taupo Volcanic Zone. The black inclusions are likely to be Pyroxene phenocryst in a groundmass of what was at one point white hot volcanic ash. 

Not one that I can immediately see, in order to derive a per cubic metre figure (m^-3) you need to know how many cubes of soil you have in a given column unit, that requires the depth of the unit in question. 

I know in New Zealand we have a number of soils you can't raise dairy herds on because the nitrate in their urine strips too many nutrients too fast, to the point where one can tell where the cow urinated a couple of weeks ago because that patch of grass is dying from several different deficiencies simultaneously. My understanding is that dairy cows are, hands-down, the worst farm animal for this because they stand still when voiding and dump up to 15 litres of moderate-high nitrate liquid waste at a time which all goes effective straight down through the soil column robbing it of nutrients along the way. On the other hand there are also some soils, generally in more arid areas, where nitrate doesn't migrate right through the soil column at all but concentrates in the subsoil as a visible, white, salty, horizon. As a rule the more water retentive the soil the longer water soluble compounds like nitrate will take to work down into the ground at a given water input. There are also some chemical interactions that will bind nitrate and slow it down more than you might expect we need study them in my soil fertility papers but I can't think what they are right now. But to answer your question, usually soluble soil ions (which nitrate is) move on a timescale of days, weeks or maybe months, but not decades. We wouldn't need to apply slow-release nitrate fertilisers annually if it didn't migrate through at least the top-soil relatively rapidly. 

In addition to what @Michael said, one can add that the claim that "geologist date rocks by the fossils they contain and date fossils by the rocks in which they are found" is misleading: are some rocks being dated using fossils? Yes. Are some fossils being dated by the rock they are contained in? Yes. But they are not the same fossils or the same rocks in both cases! An example using marine micropaleontology (both because this is what I know best, but also because this is the discipline in which biostratigraphy is the most commonly used): some marine sections (not all) have unique sedimentary properties that allow the use of geochronological tools, or the use of magnetostratigraphy. But those sections are in practice a minority, so what we do is that we use the "good" sections as references: on those, we look at abundant microfossils having a clearly marked first and/or last occurrence, as a bio-datum. And then we use those datums on the other sections to estimate their age. Eventually other microfossils are found on those sections and therefore their age are estimated this way. But those microfossils won't be used to date anything. 

I can make arguments for half a dozen or more things but the most likely are Agate and Calcite, try a drop of dilute vinegar on the surface, if bubbles form then you have a Calcite, or at least a reactive Carbonate Mineral, if it doesn't react then the most likely answer is Agate or another amorphous Silicate. I say these are the most likely purely on the basis of the commonality of those minerals generally it could be something really odd but I don't enough about the specific mineralogy of South Wales to start on those possibilities. 

Inverse problems deal with creating theories based on observed data, as opposed to making predictions about the real world based on existing theoretical models, so the "results of the measurement of observable parameter" is a confusing way of saying "the real measurements being used as data". Parameter simply refers to the value being measured. An example would be if you have a forestry block and you want to understand why some trees are preforming better than others; you'd measure a whole group of variables that formed a set of parameters, one of which might be "tree health" based on say height, girth, leaf activity, and transpiration rate and another that's "soil fertility" based on key nutrient levels, particle size distribution, bulk density, and water holding capacity. The relationship between those two parameters then lets you formulate a theory that you can apply at other sites that you know the "soil fertility" of to predict the growth of trees there. In the real world you have to test your theory with what in my GIS classes they called a "Ground Truth", that's where you go out and measure the parameters of a different real world site being used for the same crop and see if your theory accounts for the results at that site (we did them to confirm the relationship between satellite readings and on-the-ground data). When you've done this at a number of sites and the measurements all conform to your theory you can start applying your model as a predictive formula for sites not yet in use. 

This is a very minimalist example of course, it only draws the coastlines (as a line by opposition to drawing the continents as polygons, that would allow a more advanced colouring scheme but the projection to mercator of polygons is more complex, as Antarctica creates problems). 

The Silurian Period is now known to have undergone several significant positive $\delta^{13}C_{carb}$ excursions, namely the early Aeronian, Late Aeronian, Valgu, Ireviken, Mulde, Lau & Klonk events (see e. g. Cramer et al. 2011; Gradstein et al. 2012). It seems to me that those excursions where mainly studied in the context of chemostratigraphy and not paleoclimatology, though. Is there any hypotheses on what could have triggered these excursions? How come the short (ca. 24 Myr) Silurian be so unstable has to have so many significant excursions?
