From within an Epicurean point of view, given the existence of power and empathy, there is not a problem here. The bullet-pointed question is on point entirely, but 'when someone in pain dies' is outside the relevant frame of reference, unless that person is you. The release from pain of other people is not something that you can consider. How could you judge the balance of their pleasure and pain? Why would you try to do the impossible? You are competent to judge your own suffering, and the odds are that objectively considering it, the balance is not no negative you would rather not exist, unless you have honestly rid yourself of the natural human bias toward existing. But if you are really there, dying is in order. Epicurus would care nothing about the suffering of the dead person, before or after his death, except to the extend that it affects himself. He is not a utilitarian, he is a hedonist, so there is no aggregation of all suffering or pleasure, only the given suffering or pleasure of each individual who has to choose to act. A hedonist still needs to be concerned with others' pleasure or pain because pleasure and pain travel between individuals, and ideas like fairness and safety require communal action to avoid mental anguish. Others' suffering pains many people. The work on oneself that would protect one from that is the Stoic way, which Epicureanism rejects as too hard to be sensible. Suffering others also often decide to spread their pain around. So removing the opportunity for both seems like a reasonable way to reduce the odds of being victim to either of these effects. That would increase the degree of one's own happiness. The idea that the release of others from pain would be good does not rely on their having value of their own. It is enough that humans are constructed in a way that borrows pain from others and that pain encourages bad decisions and rash actions that can cause others pain. Since we are others' others, we will be doing some of that borrowing and suffering some of that transferred aggression and poor judgement. 

Any natural language allows introducing new words defined entirely by context clues. One is allowed language moves like "We call one such as him a 'neebledy gitner'." Where no one has seen this sequence of letters used this way before its introduction, and what specific aspects of 'one such as him' are germane to the newly named status of 'gitnerhood' or 'neeblediness' remains to be determined entirely by inference. I can form a nonce-word at will without marking it out in any way as a newly minted word, and it will be understood. Speakers will just incorporate it into their lexicon provisionally for the duration of the context, and for that period, it is a valid word. These words do not follow any formation rules or usage constraints beyond those of normal words, and they do not remain a permanent addition to the language. So even if you allow for adding words by parsing a formal definition, or by allowing a generic form in a specific context, there is no single grammar that produces all and only English words. The list changes by the minute. If there were some true definition of all English words, it could not possibly accommodate this level of flexibility, where words are temporarily or locally valid simply because we use them, but the exact same lexeme elsewhere would not be valid, for lack of a proper introduction. 

The first and second paragraphs contradict one another. If Person A did not expect fairness or balance, awareness of it not being present would not cause any pain. This person therefore harbors expectations which offend their own standards, and they are therefore a (mild) hypocrite. Person A needs to be honest about this 'nature'. Adequate analysis of the existing hypocrisy would probably discern the right approach. But as stated, the premises are just internally inconsistent. 

People who talk about qualia are sure they are facts. If they are something intermediate between facts and values, much of their importance evaporates. In the latter case, since values are clearly negotiated, one can fall back on Wittgenstein to resolve the problem, by injecting the perspective that qualia are just artifacts of the social value of definitions. If red is an experientially defined parameter of our interpretation of sensory data to which we train our reactions, and not a quality, then all red things have in common is a social agreement about their likely physical effects on human beings, and not a real common content to our experiences. So to the degree qualia exist and have value, this has to remain unrelated to them. 

You seem to be re-deriving Aristotle's Four Causes: material, efficient, formal and final. Vaguely, material causes are what make up the object's state (it is made out of this kind of matter in this kind of motion), efficient causes are the chain of effects that lead to its current state (it has come from this previous motion because of these physical laws), formal causes are the meanings it has taken on in getting here (it was put into that form by these choices to put it in these categories), and final causes are the reasons it has gotten here (it ultimately serves this purpose). I have a chair made of wood and glue, by lathing and joining, to play the role of a chair, because people sit. I think that once you solidify the ideas it becomes obvious the four have to be simultaneous, presuming determinism or otherwise. You can ask which is more basic, and try to decide between idealism, materialism, process philosophy, and Deism, but none of the four comes temporally prior to the other three. You can claim that all final causes precede all efficient causes, for instance, but the specific final cause of this chair did not precede the specific efficient cause of the last stage of its assembly. If someone startled me in assembling it and I beat them over the head with it, then its final cause was to be a weapon and not a chair. Likewise something's material cause precedes its efficient cause, in a general sense: The wood has to be there to be lathed and assembled. But the specific material cause of this chair does not precede the efficient cause -- a different glob of glue could hold the last leg on, so the chairs exact material cause would not be exactly the same. The question turns into a matter of scale and perspective, rather than actual logic. In general final and formal causes recede into the future as they get farther from the immediate instantiation. Things take on meanings and purposes and then retain them until the object itself is actually changed. Material and efficient causes recede into the past, as things come out of apparently unrelated things and become more noticeably themselves via processes that roll forward in time. 

This is far from an actual answer, but it suggests support for the idea. If a construction were to proceed here, a few first steps would be: 

We aren't civilized enough to set rules about war, we are only civilized enough to punish behaviors that we find repugnant, afterward. We would like to believe that we have control over the behavior of human beings at their worst. But obviously, U.S. soldiers in our very most recent war committed severe breaches of the supposed rules of war, e.g. at Abu Ghraib, for which we then had to make reparations. And those were not even soldiers in combat, making unfortunate decisions due to unbearable pressure. They were just bored prison guards. Being able to set accounts into balance after the fact is not the same as having actual control. The Salic code of weregeld did not end revenge killing centuries and centuries ago. It made it unprofitable for the clans that did it. But that did not stop anything. Killing for revenge still goes on, not just in France, but everywhere. Rulers do not really have control over their subjects -- no human being really has control over another human being. We like to think that we have established control over the emotional excesses of our fellow human beings, but this is only a rationalization. So obviously, if we chose to replace war with something else, real war would happen in an unsanctioned manner anyway, and we would end up having hypocritical clean-up mechanisms that then 'undid' it. Given the dramatic cost of modern war, and the fact that we still engage in it anyway, it is not clear that an additional 'wrapper' mechanism that made it even more inefficient, would do anything productive at all. 

Passive-aggression is a hypocritical brainwashing strategy. In this case you are talking about a passive-aggressive claim against a debt that can never be repaid, as an attempt to garner compliance from the child, or praise from others that they feel they deserve and are not getting. This has nothing to do with sacrifice. A genuine sacrifice does not result in a debt. If you do something and will try to collect on the debt later, that is investment, not a sacrifice. Sacrifice, etymologically means 'making holy' usually returning something to a state of holiness. Its most basic form (symbolized in holocausts of atonment or in Salic weregelt) may be the recognition and repayment of a debt, or its release (forgiveness in Germanic laws -- for-given-ness, the state of having had enough given for it). To the extent that debts, when mishandled, become lies that put one in a state of sin, debt is a model for sin (Forgive us our Debts...). But a real sacrifice never creates a debt. It can only resolve one. 

So 1 is false, but 2 is not necessarily true. Something can be dependent in common on several things at once, and sense-data depend both on the sense and on the origin of the sensation. There has to be some point in the process of apprehension where data enters the mind. The 'stuff' at that point is sense-data. It is perceived directly, but it originates partly outside the mind, or it could not be entering. To assume entirely otherwise -- that nothing enters the mind -- puts the tree in the mind, and takes you down Berkeley's path to where there is only one mind. If I and you both perceive the tree, and the tree is in the mind, one or both of us does not exist. This conception is from before modern theories of probing perception suggested that perceptual information flows both ways, to meet in the middle. The mind makes the guess that the red is likely, and queries the sense for validation or rebuttal. In that case the 'red' is entirely inside the mind, but the test criteria for redness still uses facts from outside of it, and those become the sense-data, but not exactly in Russel's sense. Theories that do not allow for the mind taking an active role in apprehension, by asserting assumptions about qualia, generally fail to explain why we really perceive the exact same physical data in different ways in different contexts. 

I think of their positions as being related the same way different degrees of political liberalism are. Locke is a Reformer: Much of Locke's thinking pays attention to ongoing agreements. He imagines states/professions/religions all have a built-in implicit contract. It is not his place to find a foundation for science because science already has a contract according to which it has implicitly agreed to proceed. He is simply pointing out that the 'wording' in that contract may not be as clear as everyone imagines, and that things would be better if it were squared away. Hume is a Radical: Hume wants the world to be based entirely upon a common underlying structure, and sees everything built upon other structures as not having any inherent value just by already being there. For him, the 'agreement' upon which science proceeds is useless if no one knows exactly what it is, and the vocabulary used to approximate it even fails to make complete sense. 

I would agree that these are goals with very different qualities, and suggest that both are stale. If you take 'Perspectivist' aspect of the 'Art of the Self' seriously, then both 'good' and 'amorality' seem to be the wrong way to look at things. Acknowledging the equal goodness of multiple perspectives is not dissolving or removing morality, it is making it into something with more dimensions. The 'transvaluing' person is not 'amoral': 'Beyond' is not just 'without'. It is easier to get rid of morality by moving backward rather than forward. It is a lot more work to move beyond the known and given sets of values into some situation where they all remain, and can be compared, recombined, etc. (It is likely to be impossible. But possible is just a valuation, and is not necessarily good.) Yet to find a 'good', by folding all of these up into a single metric is doomed. It means ultimately that you have chosen a given set of values and abandoned some future perspectives to form a static standard. Part of the point of looking at the reversal of valuations over time is to show how power is a dynamic. I necessarily remains fluid, and it does not choose for things to be 'good' without eventually spoiling and becoming 'bad'. There is no 'good' or 'bad' outside relation to some aspect of context and personal nature that is not fixed. I still hold by the notion that for all the political dressing, Nietzsche is all about aesthetics. Very good art, codified and repeated, is eventually 'good' yet ineffective. You can claim there is some definition of effectiveness that rolls up all the previous definitions of good in art, but then you cannot state it before it changes. 

Question 2. Can we believe certain scientific theories/results even if we personally don't understand most of the concepts/theories ourselves? Why? Isn't this similar to how people put their "faith" in god? Aren't we placing our "faith" on the experts? We can trust a scientist the same way we trust a plumber, instead of the same way we trust a priest. We trust the plumber to handle the pipes right and make things less leaky -- we trust the scientist to handle the observations right and make things less nonsensical. This is less about essential faith, than about trust that human beings are well-intended and generally effective. We trust the priest to put the work of both these people into a larger context, which is often based upon psychologically appealing essential articles of faith, and help us to balance our responses to all of their products. Unfortunately this isn't something you can get wrong, it is only something at which you can be ineffective. Ineffective religions deploy cognitive dissonance manipulations to create conflict, because conflict works to their advantage -- it is easy to put dramatic conflict into context and therefore seem effective. At the same time religionists habitually do something important that cannot reasonably be judged by others. So religion often develops an undue arrogance about itself and readily encroaches on domains where it has no business. Again, there are bad religionists, religion is not bad. 

Accepting death does not remove the terror or excitement of the unknown. And what lies beyond death is always unknown. So I do not see how one could really support Query 1. The devoutly religious and some psychedelicists claim to have put this fear to rest, but they then seem to become attached to the process of dying in a positive way. So they are still affected by their own feelings about death. Whether it is a negative or a positive feeling, thinking about death continues to have a 'frisson'. To me Query 2 seems to contradict Query 1. If one has lost an obsessive attachment to death, one's life should suddenly be all about death? I think a lot of people who are leaving us become less self-centered and quite concerned with those surviving them. 

The need for money is part of an existing social contract. If you do need money, you have signed onto that contract. You cannot be both within and outside the contract. You need to set it aside entirely if you find its central tenets morally objectionable. Money is not what you need. What you need is a means of using your own attributes to support yourself. If you want to morally disconnect from capitalism, that cannot involve money, since the value of money is clearly embedded in the system as a whole. There are people who have taken this seriously and established a parallel social contract that insulates a sense of value based upon some other criterion from the need for money. Communities like Ammana and Oneida, various tax-resisting Quaker Meetings during the Vietnam War, and the Shaker communities are historical examples. A living example is the Rainbow Family of Living Light. Such communities do not use money among themselves. To manage this, they have to maintain a buffer between themselves and the economic community. They usually institutionalize this buffer in the form of 'sovereign' land in unincorporated areas that is never allowed to have a monetary value assigned to it. It is too far from public services to involve real estate tax, and it is either free of claim because it is hereditary and has not been sold for an extended period, or it is kept in an endless limbo of mortgage that is never allowed to build equity, so it is insulated from the income tax. It is held in common and not passed down, so it avoids inheritance, which is the other point land that is not sold might be assigned monetary value and have taxes extracted. This freezes this part of the means of production outside the capitalist system. Those who hold this land may or may not allow you to join them on the assumption you will find away to contribute to the welfare of the community as a whole and that will offset the work involved in maintaining the insulation from capitalism. Since the rest of our social contract is tied to taxes, this involves leaving the legal system and having some alternative means of government, that you may or may not find adequate, logical or fair. So to some degree there is a risk of a more genuine form of slavery. But you are generally free to leave with nothing and return to the capitalist system through charitable institutions.
