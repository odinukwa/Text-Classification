The standalone forms act as nouns and can take cases, while the clitic forms can be suffixed to words like verbs and prepositions, but take no clitics themselves: 

Note that there is no use at all of vem as a simple relative pronoun ‘that/who(m)’ in that list. There are some interrogative pronouns, like var ‘where’ and vilket ‘which’, that do also function as relative pronouns, but vem is not one of them. It is worth noting that vilket, which does function as a simple relative pronoun, is not used like ‘which’ in English: its antecedent is invariably a clause or some type of more or less clearly defined notion, never a simple noun phrase. This is somewhat similar to (but still distinct from) the difference in English between restrictive and non-restrictive usages of that and wh- words (see StoneyB’s comment above). This is also why only vilket (neuter) is used relatively: the commune vilken would not make sense with reference to an abstract notion. In cases where vilket is used, the simpler relative pronouns may not be used, just like the corresponding cases in English can only take which, never that. Or to put it in different terms: cases where English can use either ‘that’ or ‘which’3 can only take som in Swedish, while cases where English ‘that’ would be ungrammatical must take vilket in Swedish: 

Using Wikipedia’s examples of the nouns bwrdd (m.) ‘table’ and bord (f.) ‘table’ with the inflecting adjective brwnt ‘dirty’: 

Quenya also has specifically emphatic pronouns that presumably really emphasise the subject. These are made up of the stem e- with the (non-shortened) clitic form of the pronoun suffixed; so the 1sg. form is enyë. These are also used with the endingless verb form, as can be seen in this direct quote from the song Namárië (‘Farewell’) from The Lord of the Rings, which uses the 2sg. future (-uva-) of the verb hir- ‘find’: 

One would think that as long as one of the two vowels are closed, then a diphthong could be formed. However, if a diphthong consists of two closed vowels with the same roundness, like the following 8 diphthongs, then they rarely occur: 

For those with être, the past participle agrees in gender and number with the subject. For example: . (She came) Ils sont venus. (They (male) came) Elles sont venues. (They (female) came) 

Main problem In French, past participles that take avoir are not inflected to agree with the object in gender and number, except when the object is placed in front of the verb. Is this phenomenon found in other Romance languages? How did this phenomenon originate? How is the agreement of the participle in Old French? This page seems to have some clues. How is this phenomenon in Spanish and Italian? 

According to WALS chapter 136, the languages are divided according to their words for the first and second person singular pronouns. The M-T languages are the languages which have an /M/ sound (or similar sounds) for the first-person singular pronoun and a /T/ sound (or similar sounds) for the second-person singular pronoun. The M-T paradigmatic languages are the languages where the /M/ and the /T/ sounds occur in the same position, i.e. you can find a common pattern. German 

Late-closed refers to those that are open in Vulgar Latin and then became close, in terms of the syllable (not the vowel). Usually they only have one , so the syllable was open until the final vowel was lost, causing to be shifted to the now final syllable (second chain, ). capillum > cheveux Short i in Latin becomes in Vulgar Latin. Only long i is preserved as in Vulgar Latin (the lengthening is basically gone). For example, . Therefore, the answer to your question is, quoting you: 

Notes: 1 It is perhaps worth noting as an aside that where Swedish and Norwegian have only one relative pronoun, som, Danish has two, distinguishing between der (lit. ‘there’) used only as a subject, and som used as either subject or any other constituent. 2 As in English, the default relative pronoun som ‘that’ cannot be used directly following a preposition: *med som ‘*with that’ is as ungrammatical and nonsensical in Swedish as it is in English. 3 I am counting the difference between restrictive and non-restrictive as belonging to the same case type here; so even if one may sometimes be preferable to the other because of the level of restriction inherent in the relative clause, they are still nominally interchangeable. 

Both bwrdd ~ byrddau, bord ~ bordydd, and brwnt/bront ~ bryntion/bryntion inflect for number here, but the article is uninflected. Apart from the regular gender inflection of adjectives modifying feminine nouns being subject to soft mutation, brwnt also has a specifically feminine form bront. 

(Though some of those strike me as being highly unlikely to ever be used; indefinite plural possessives are rare in general, and I don't believe I've personally ever had any need to use one with the word snabel-a at all.) 

When a standalone pronoun is used as the subject of a verb, however, the verb takes no personal ending of its own: the pronoun is only expressed once. Instead, a simpler, endingless form of the verb is used, which only distinguishes number (the singular and plural forms are known; the dual form is not known). The singular is the bare inflectional stem, and the plural is formed by adding -r.1 

Yes, it would be utterly incorrect to use vem in this case. The default pronoun to use as subject or object in a relative clause in Swedish is som.1 In all the Nordic languages, vem ‘who(m)’ is used in three ways: 

However, some of the forms did not have the yod, e.g. VL. *sequis > Sp. sigues. What is it that caused the raising of those forms? 

The above phenomenon is also found in other Romance languages such as Spanish and Italian, with their own versions of avoir and être. However, what seems to be unique to French is that the participles that take avoir agree in gender and number with the object when the object is placed in front of the verb. For example: . (This is the car which I bought) The participle is inflected to agree with the subject (la voiture) which is feminine. 

When Latin evolved to French, the vowel /u/ fronted to become /y/... except in Latin "VRSVS" /ur.sus/ > French "ours" /uʁs/, in which the vowel /u/ was kept. I do not think that the /rs/ environment kept the /u/, because we can see Latin "DVRVS" /du.rus/ > Old French "durs" /dyrs/, where the "u" is changed anyway. Usually, front vowels tend to be unrounded and back vowels tend to be rounded, but this sound change seems to have violated this rule. 

Background (skip if you know French) In French, to generate the past tense, you use the past participle of the verb, attaching in front a conjugated form of avoir or être. For example: 

I am aware that probably there is no answer as to what exactly caused the fronting and the "VRSVS" exception, but mere guesses would be fine for me, as such sound change violates the rule that front vowels tend to be unrounded. 

Conclusion The fact that we can have a column "common" is what makes those language M-T paradigmatic instead of M-T non-paradigmatic. 

All forms of the Latin verb "FACERE" that went to French had a "c", but it has disappeared in all forms of the French verb "faire". In FACIS > fais, the "c" completely disappeared. In FACIUNT > font, the "c" also disappeared. In FACIAM > fasse, the "c" became "ss". I have noticed that some of the instances of "c" in the Latin forms are followed by a yod. Perhaps this is the cause of the difference. However, the "c" in FACIUNT is also followed by a yod, and it also disappeared. I am seeking an explanation of the evolution of these forms, and I would also prefer to have a step by step evolution of those three selected forms above. 

There are not many examples of verbs with actual third-person subject endings, but there are many with explicit subjects, and these all have the endingless forms as well: [laurië] lantar lassi (‘[like gold] fall the leaves’, aorist of lanta- ‘fall’), mornië utúlië (‘darkness has come’, perfect of tul- ‘come’), etc. So even though I haven’t been able to find any sources that say this in so many words, I think it’s safe to say that the system of only adding personal pronoun clitics to the verb when there is no explicit subject holds when the subject is a noun phrase rather than a pronoun, too.   Notes: 1 This endingless form is also used when negating verbs. Generally, Quenya is loosely based on Finnish, of which Tolkien was a great fan, and this is no exception: as in Finnish, negating a verb involves conjugating a ‘negative verb’ and leaving the main verb in an impersonal form that only distinguishes number (in some tenses); for example Finnish ole-n ‘I am’ vs. e-n ole ‘I am not’ and Quenya cára-n(yë) ‘I make’ vs. ua-n(yë) cára ‘I do not make’. In Finnish, however, an explicit subject does not cause the verb to be in the endingless form, so it is minä olen, not *minä ole. 2 Final -i regularly yields -ë in Quenya, so tulë is the expected outcome of *tuli. This historical sound change is also taken piecemeal from Finnish. 

If you’ll accept non-natural languages, one such case would be J.R.R. Tolkien’s conlang Quenya. The general system of conjugation in Quenya is that the ‘verbal endings’ that show person and number are really just clitic and optionally shortened forms of the personal pronouns. They are thus not really verbal endings at all—they can also be added to other things, like prepositions. They have standalone forms (with optional lengthening of the vowel when stressed) and clitic forms (long and short); nominative/accusative is not distinguished. To give a few pronouns to work with (listing standalone, stressed standalone, long clitic, short clitic): 

/ɥu/ /uɥ/, which does appear in Cantonese. /wy/ /yw/ /ɰi/, which does appear in Korean. /iɰ/ /jɯ/ /ɯj/ 

नर (nara) This is from Proto-Indo-European *h₂nḗr. Cognates include Ancient Greek ἀνήρ, genitive ᾰ̓νδρός, whence English andro-. नरक (naraka) According to hi.wiktionary: 

I am seeking an explanation for the development of the forms of Spanish "seguir" from Latin "SEQVI" (Vulgar Latin: *sequire), especially the irregular forms. Especially, why did the "e" become "i" in the first syllable in some forms? I have read that it is because of the yod that follows it, causing the vowel "e" to be raised to "i". For example, in *sequivit > siguió (pretérito tercera persona/preterite third-person): 

Splitters There are actually splitters. In the Cantonese language (my native language), there was a historical splitter around a century ago, in which the high flat tone was split into two tones (53 and 55), with unpredictable rules. This caused some homophones to lose their status as homophones and helped to distinguish the meanings. The splitter has re-merged in Hong Kong Cantonese (my dialect) so I do not even know which words were pronounced 53 and which words 55. Adding extra information So how do languages deal with the increase in number of homophones? In Chinese, many thousand years ago, most morphemes consisted of a single syllable. However, as the language evolves, homophones arise, and the Chinese formed compound words from the monosyllabic words, solving the problem of homophones. In Spanish, which evolved from Latin, the word for "heart" is "corazón" while that of Latin is "cor". Such a simple word is lengthened in Proto-Romance already, by adding "-tione". cor -> *coratione -> corazón 

I apologize for my formatting. It is hard to do this in a neat style. If I had included every step, the 4 sound change chains above would take a whole page. In words This wikipedia page has detailed the causes quite well. Basically: 

According to SAOB, snabel-a is quite regular: like other letters of the alphabet, abbreviations, etc., a colon is used to separate the stem from its desinences, and the forms are: 

This is more of a bit of musing than a proper answer, but it could be the reason that at least the first two have this seemingly irregular stress pattern. Concúpiscent and concúpiscence don't sound oddly stressed to me at all—in fact they sound perfectly acceptable and normal, despite the fact that I'm quite sure I've never heard anyone say either word. Concúpiscible, on the other hand, sounds downright bizarre. Like you, I could find no other parallel for an -Vscence/-Vscibility word having the stress on the syllable before the -sc-, so it puzzled me that I find concúpiscent/-ce so normal-sounding. I tried to figure out what pattern made -úpiscent sound perfectly normal—and it finally hit me: magnificent and its ilk! The -ficent suffix is etymologically unrelated, of course (apart from stemming from Latin participles), but it is phonetically /ˡVCɪsənt/ with antepaenultimate stress, just like what we find in concupiscent. And unlike more closely related word like reminiscent and dehiscent, there's no base verb *concupisce to show where the stress should go. So I would theorise that perhaps concupiscent/-ce, wherever the stress originally lay, may have retracted its stress due to phonetic similarity with words in -ficent. That doesn't account for concupiscible, of course, and I'll admit that I'm stumped there. Looking through a reverse dictionary I cannot find a single other word ending in -cible that has preantepaenultimate stress—it seems to be totally irregular and counter to all logic. 

Welsh is another such language, to some extent at least. Nouns and adjectives do not inflect for case; most nouns and a subset of adjectives inflect for number; the majority of adjectives do not inflect for number, though. All adjectives inflect for gender. There is no indefinite article, but there is a definite article. The definite article has three different forms, but like English /ə ~ ən/ and /ðə ~ ði/, the forms are based on phonological environment, not morphological form:
