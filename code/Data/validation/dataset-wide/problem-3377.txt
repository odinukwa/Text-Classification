I there a resource that lists the phonemes that are used in different languages? I would prefer a ranking of the most common phonemes within each language like in this example: German: 1 /ɛ/ 2 /ə/ ... 15 /x/ If no explicit ranking is available, grouping ("very common", "common", "rare") within each language would help to. The more speaker a language has the more important is this ranking for me. My goal is to identify phonemes that appear in many words of many languages and phonemes that are rarely used across all spoken languages of the world (weighted by number of speakers). I want to find a set of phoneme of which one could construct a language who's words are easy to pronounce for as many people on earth as possible. 

Addendum 2 (March 2018) I think I better tell you the context. (What do I want to do with this list?) I am writing a fantasy story. There was a small group of aliens traveling through space, and they got lost. They had technical problems and they stranded on a planet that turned out to be our planet earth. This happened thousands of years ago, and all humans on earth are descendants form this small group, and all languages spoken on earth today derived form the language of this small group of invaders. I want to construct a language, that could be the proto-language of the first humans on earth. My second goal is to make this language as easy to be pronounced by everybody on this planet, as possible. I want that people from China find it as easy to pronounce as people from Saudi Arabia, from Russia, from the USA, from Namibia, and so on. I think that i don't need a set of common phonemes to combine, but a set of very common syllables, because even wide spread phonemes can be hard to be pronounced, when you use unusual combinations. I want to try to build an artlang that is made of common syllables, and this is why I am looking for the most frequent spoken syllables on earth. btw: When two syllables are similar, I want to count them as identical. For example the english words "I, eye, ay, aye" and the German "Ei" are all the same syllable (/aɪ/). 

An important addition. Cecily Clark (Clark 1992) argues it is incorrect to ascribe such changes solely to "widespread scribal ignorance of the English language." 

(pp. 28-29; emphasis mine - Alex B.). Sara Pons-Sanz (2015) traces this idea back to Björkman 1900. As for Scandinavian influence on English vocabulary, I strongly recommend reading at least Part IV. Scandinavian Influence (pp. 171-221) in Durkin 2014, Borrowed Words (Philip Durkin is the chief etymologist of the OED, by the way). One very important thing to remember - as Durkin reminds on p. 192 

After all the comments above, there's not much left to say. I didn't really want to post it as an answer but the quotes from Bhat 2004 (since you wanted references) are too long for a comment. "Interrogative proforms are used primarily for obtaining information from the addressee regarding an unknown entity, and hence the speaker can provide only a general indication of its identity. He is therefore forced to use a general term for referring to it. Even when interrogative pronouns have some of their extended uses like testing the knowledge of the addressee, there would still be a need to use a general term." and "Proforms [...] are general terms that are used for carrying out different functions like (i) identifying the participants of an event by locating them with reference to the spatio-temporal location of the speech act participants (or indicating the location, time, manner, etc. of the event itself in a similar fashion), (ii) referring back (or forward) to other expressions that occur in the utterance or in previous utterances, or (iii) indicating the scope of a question, negation, or exclamation. They are generally made up of two different elements of which one indicates the function of the preform (demonstrative, interrogative, indefinite, or anaphoric (relative) ) and the other one denotes their category or scope (person, thing, place, manner, quality, quantity, etc.)." "All proforms share a set of general concepts and hence expressing a general concept can be regarded as the first set of their main functions." 

Ranging position. The syllable. This number tells you how often this syllable can be heard when one million words are spoken (which means, that frequent words are repeated many times and therefore theirs syllables are counted more often) Take a dictionary of all German words, where flexions of the same lexeme are distinct words (run, runs, ran and running would be listed as four different words). Count how often the syllable appears in this dictionary (the dictionary itself contains 365.530 different German words.) 

I'm not interested in the 4th column. English: $URL$ This list has only 3 columns, where #1 and #2 are identical with the first two columns of the German list. Columns #3 is the same as the German col#3, but in the German list you have counts per million, in the english you have percent, which is just another representation of the same thing. How would I use those lists to create an all-language-list? In the english list I would convert the numbers in column 3 into counts per million like in the German list. Then I need the number of native speakers per language. Such a list can be found here: $URL$ As you see, English had 360 million native speakers in 2010, and German had 89 million native speakers in the same year. So I multiply the (converted) english numbers by 360, and multiply the numbers in columns #3 of the German list with 89, and then merge both lists. If there are syllables used in english as well as in German (like [ɪn]), I add both wighted numbers. Then I sort this list again by those numbers. The result is a list of the most frequent syllables of the German and English spoken part of the world. And because I am interested in the most frequent syllables, it is safe to ignore rare languages, among which you will find all languages, that not have been studied. And to give you an example what I am not looking for: $URL$ There you find numbers of digrams and trigrams, but this are not phonetic syllables! 

As you may know, quite some of the IE languages know preverbs, who may modify the meaning of a verbal root. I would like to know more about the interrelation of the various preverbs found in these languages, especially the connection between the ones existing in Sanskrit (called upasarga there) and the ones that still exist in modern German (rather called Präfix, Halbpräfix or Präfixoid there). Is anyone aware of and could supply sources that either directly compare these descendants of PIE preverbs or single publications that give information on the ancestors of the Sanskrit upasargas and the German prefixes? 

As a student of mostly dead "classical" languages, most of the "linguistics" I did encounter, was and is historic linguistics aiming at a reconstruction of a postulated "proto"-language, predating the known and handed down languages, which again predate the spoken languages of today. Now, while from my perspective of a semi- to quarter-linguist it makes perfect sense, that linguistics should focus on language as opposed to literature (or: "art", as esoneill put it), already the question struck me as quite absurd (regarding my experience), since the linguistics I know does not only not focus on spoken language but even near-totally suppresses any reference to "language" as something spoken rather than written. This is, of course, because of the fact, that written evidence endures much longer than the sound of an utterance and so is the only available data for this sort of historical linguistics. Still, sometimes even here, stress is laid on the spoken languages. Of course not so much in what concerns "proto"-languages, but there are, for example, attempts to reconstruct the phonology of (Vedic) Sanskrit and it is quite well known that Classical Sanskrit never was a spoken language at all. (Incidentally, this holds true for most of the "classical" Indian languages). This kind of reverses the modern approach to languages, reflected in the answers already given: spoken language is here only appended and ancillary to the written. 

I have never seen a serious linguist claiming that Armenian didn't belong to the IE family (it is a satem language). Where did you read that? I strongly recommend chapter 16, Armenian, in Fortson 2010 textbook, esp. parts "The Introduction" and "From PIE to Classical Armenian", pp. 382-393. It's a good idea to read it thoroughly! Also, have a look at $URL$ (it's a chapter from an excellent etymological dictionary of Armenian lexicon inherited from the IE) Some of the claims you made are in fact incorrect (e.g. words for relatives; also see Basic Words from Wikipedia, posted by Daniel Briggs): Arm. mayr ‘mother’ Arm. hayr ‘father’ Arm. khoyr ‘sister’ Arm. eġbayr 'brother' Arm. dowstr 'daughter' Arm. taygr 'brother-in-law' (cf. Sanskrit devar-) Arm. nu 'daughter-in-law' (cf. Greek nuos, Old Church Slavonic snuxa) some other common examples are: Arm. kov ‘cow’ Arm. tun ‘house’ Arm. em ‘I am’ Also, it's a good idea to compare Armenian with Greek: Arm. get 'water' - Greek hydor Arm. ayr 'man'- Greek aner Re: numerals, your assumption is also wrong; here's a quote from Matasovic 2009 (Winter 1992 is of the same opinion): "Here are the numerals from 1 to 10: mi, erku, erekc, čcorkc, hing, vecc, ewtcn, utc, inn, tasn. Although this is not obvious at first sight, their forms are inherited from PIE (*smi-yo-, *dwoh1, *treyes, *kwetwores, *penkwe, *(k's)wek's, *septm, *h3ek'toh1, *newn, *dek'm)." 

It may be of interest to note, that کندن shows a root-dualism. The Old Indian form of the root is khan, similar Pāzand χandan. So, the New Persian words χān/χāne, "house" derives from the same root as kent. This shows, that it is quite plausible that a word denoting a place to live should derive from the root "to dig". On the other hand it maybe explains, why you did not find any use of the word kent in Persian. 

IPA and IAST serve different purposes, as their respective names already suggest. IPA is an alphabet for phonetic rendering of speech (in the broad sense). To use it on Sanskrit we would have to agree first on how Sanskrit is pronounced correctly or have different renderings depending on traditions of pronounciation (Is, for example, भ् an aspirated stop or breathy voice? Is Visarga ः pronounced as kind of an echo of the preceding vowel with h inserted or as a velar fricative?). Also, for example, the letter Anusvāra would be represented by different symbols depending on its pronounciation which again depends on the surrounding letters. Furthermore, we would not be able, to distinguish different spellings if they are (supposedly) pronounced the same, as संधि vs. सन्धि. This being stated, doesn't it (at least for most indological purposes) seem much easier to use IAST, which as the name suggests is a system for transliteration of Sanskrit? That means, we have a one-to-one correspondence of symbols in Devanagari and IAST, which does neither add nor remove any information that is preserved in the original text? 

Have a look at the following book: Keller, Rudi. 1994. On language change: The invisible hand in language. London: Routledge. 

The term "set phrase," when used in the broad sense, will include anything but free combinations (Cowie's classification above); semi-, quasi-, and full phrasemes (Melchuk's classification). For example, Mel'chuk 1998 says the following: "People speak in set phrases, rather than in separate words, hence the crucial importance of set phrases. At the same time, set phrases, or PHRASEMES, represent one of the major difficulties in theoretical linguistics as well as in dictionary making" (Mel'chuk 1998: 24). 

As for OE beginnan, two explanations are possible. 1. Scandinavian influence (Dieter Kastovsky, e.g. Kastovsky 1992 specifically mentions OE beginnan): However, there is no direct evidence to support this hypothesis but we may have some indirect evidence. First, even though we can find OE beginnan, another verb was much more common – OE onginnan, until it was superseded by ME beginnen around the fourteenth century. An interesting similar case could be the development of OE ongean (> PDE again). The ODEE (ed. Onions, 1966) says “the native forms in aȝ-, ay- did not survive beyond XVI, being superseded universally by forms in ag-, derived from Scand. and appearing first in northern and eastern texts XIII.” More information about the chronology of this change could come from the development of OE giefan (> PDE give). The ODEE mentions that the non-patalal variant appears c.1200 and that the regular ME forms yive, yeve etc. “prevailed in southern and midland writings till XV.” So, the remark by darkgamma that "the etymology is off and the chronology is wrong by a few hundred years" is irrelevant. However, the biggest problem is the apparent lack of a Scandinavian (Old Norse) cognate, and I'm by no means the first linguist to notice this. 2. (Analogical) leveling: However, there is no conclusive evidence to support this, either. We have to remember that even though it is “inherently irregular,” it is a “fairly systematic process” (Hock and Joseph 2009: 152; emphasis mine - Alex B.), which means we should be able to find other examples – very few but they should be out there. Cf. Hogg 1992 “with the degree of allomorphic variation noted in §7.41, it would be expected that there should be considerable analogical levelling and extension” (Hogg 1992/2011: 269) and later he claims that “[a]mongst strong verbs there appear not to be clear-cut examples [of analogical levelling – Alex B.] in OE” (p. 270; emphasis mine - Alex B.). However, in our case this would contradict the directionality of Mańczak’s seventh tendency of analogy, which states that “the forms of the present more often bring about the reshaping of other tenses than vice versa” (as cited in Campbell 2013: 265). Examples of levelling (strong verbs, West Saxon): OE gyllan – geal – gullon, cf. PDE yell (yelled) OE gyldan – geald – guldon, cf. PDE yield (yielded) Also, the analogical levelling hypthesis cannot explain why OE onginnan > ME aginnen was superseded by ME beginnen. To conclude, as Pons-Sanz 2015 writes, "In the end, it is up to the linguist’s judgement and his / her willingness to accept the Norse derivation of a term without a formal Norse imprint that determines whether or not it will make it to the list of medieval English words with a Norse etymon. This, of course, is a serious problem for historical linguistics, given the central place of many Norse-derived terms in the English language."
