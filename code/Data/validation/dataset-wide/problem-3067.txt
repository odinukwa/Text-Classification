The PPSh-41 and PPS are not particularly remarkable submachine guns, not much better or worse than contemporaries. It isn't the gun itself which excelled, but how many were made: 7 million during the war. This is more than twice production of MP 40s, M3 grease guns, and M1 Thompsons combined. The only equivalent gun is the Sten gun which was cheap, brutal, and awful. 

The Germans conducted Operation Himmler, a series of fake Polish raids into German territory. SS and SD troops, wearing Polish uniforms, would attack and vandalize German border positions and towns. To add authenticity, they'd leave behind dead bodies in Polish uniforms, usually prisoners from concentration camps. Hitler used these fake raids as pretext for his invasion of Poland in a speech on Sept 1st. 

The Winter War provided a clear and relatively cheap lesson for the Soviets: they had to change and change fast. Had they not begun those changes in 1940, better training, professional military leaders, better winter equipment and training, the Germans may well have entered Moscow and Leningrad in winter 1941. As poorly as the Soviets did, they were able to stall the Germans enough to throw off their very optimistic timetables. Still, this didn't stop yet another purge of the Soviet military leadership before and during the German invasion. 

The use of a magazine like a conventional gun suggests why the "electric revolver" is a revolver. Rather than have a power pack like most sci-fi and real directed energy weapons, presumably each cylinder held its own lethal electrical charge fired in a ray out the barrel. Putting aside how they manage to focus and direct electricity over 70 meters of air (we've barely fired that out) there's the problem of packing a lethal charge which can jump that gap into a bullet sized package: basically a AA battery. If you think the battery on your cell phone sucks, imagine it with with 1920s low density battery technology that was 10 to 100 times lower than we have now. Before you get excited, they weren't lasers. They were just a very strong camera flash in a gun form. The magazines contained disposable flash bulbs. Their intent was to disable the optics on spacecraft. 

The invasion had to happen as quickly as possible for other reasons. The Western Allies were already fighting in Italy. Delaying the invasion of France meant that fight would be left unsupported. It would leave dozens of fully-equipped US divisions sitting around on the British Isles doing nothing. The invasion relied on surprise, and every day that went by meant another day that the timing and landing site could be compromised. Every day that went by also meant the Germans could pour more concrete, plant more mines, and generally strengthen their Atlantic Wall defenses. Despite Allied advances in the Battle of the Atlantic, U-Boats remained a threat. An invasion of Europe would cut off their bases on the western coast of France. Waiting a year meant more shipping sunk. Meanwhile V-2 rockets were raining down on London. The launch sites were in Northern France and the introduction of mobile V-2 launchers made stopping them by bombing difficult. Once launched, a V-2 could not be stopped. The British wanted these launch sites overrun ASAP. To add urgency, the Germans had plenty of things nastier than explosives they could load into the V-2. Radioactive material, poison gas, chemical and biological weapons. They could use the V-2 to rain destruction down on Britain. In 1944 Germany still refused to use such weapons, but it was not known how long they would restrain themselves in the face of the advancing Soviets. 

I don't have the book referenced in the article, but the report from the International Commissions Of Inquiry is online. It mentions several "reports" (really rumors) in more detail. 

First, I believe the OP is referring to a fourth atomic bomb. There were three constructed and used during the war, though one was a test rig. 

UPDATE! I may have found the genesis of this story. Norway 1940: Chronicle of a Chaotic Campaign states... 

Here is a blog post analyzing something close to the incident you describe which contains links to many articles, blogs, videos and reports on the subject. For example... 

To narrow down this answer, I'm going to pick June - August 1944 to highlight the differences. The Western Front is mired in the Normandy bocage and the Eastern Front is fighting on the open steppes of Ukraine and Poland. These two pictures sum it all up. Normandy bocage. Source 

They were not looking to get themselves involved in the fighting, nor to impose a new peace by force; that would go from peace keeping to war making. They weren't looking to be an occupying force nor enforce a Pax Romana. Resolution 770 upped the ante by declaring the war in Bosnia a violation of Chapter VII of the UN Charter which prohibits UN members from attacking each other. A violation of Chapter VII allows the UN to use military force. UNPROFOR's mission expanded over the coming years. It began by protecting Sarajevo airport to allow humanitarian shipments (Resolution 758). A few months later it added protecting and escorting humanitarian aid convoys. In April 1993 Resolution 819 added safe areas, eventually including Sarajevo, which UNPROFOR had to protect. Finally, they had to monitor cease fire agreements. All sides, especially the Bosnian Serbs, interfered with this mission. Yet Sarajevo airport remained open and relief supplies got through. However, the safe zones were not adequately protected. Bosnian Serbs continually tested the UN's resolve by taking UN hostages, seizing weapons caches, and brazenly ignoring UN demands. The most obvious violation was Sarajevo, still under siege. It all culminated in the Srebrenica massacre when thousands of Muslim men and boys were massacred while the UN troops on the ground were too few to stop them, bound by rules of engagement from calling in support, and overrun. After this UN failure, NATO intervened. They had previously been enforcing no-fly zones and making limited, reactionary air strikes. Now they began Operation Deliberate Force to provide air support for UNPROFOR. In September 1995 NATO aircraft struck hundreds of Bosnian Serb targets including air defenses, armored vehicles, and artillery pieces. After the peace agreement, UNPROFOR was relieved by IFOR, NATO's [Peace] Implementation Force sent to enforce the treaty consisting of 60,000 NATO soldiers. This was later replaced by a NATO-led Stabilization Force (SFOR) until 2004 when it was replaced (mostly in name) by EUFOR Althea. My conclusion is the UN bureaucracy was not ready to conduct a military campaign against an adversary that was not playing by UN rules. In their attempts to avoid escalating the conflict they failed to give their troops the means to conduct their basic missions. The Bosnian Serbs prodded UNPROFOR in a series of escalating incidents, learned their limits, what lies they would believe, and how to tie them up diplomatically. The safe zone massacres finally cut through international hand wringing and allowed NATO and the UN to provide their peace keeping forces with the clear ability to retaliate and enforce the UN's demands. It's a shame it took three years and tens of thousands of lives to work that out. Additional Reading 

First because most cities in France are much smaller than cities in the US. Compare a list of French cities by population with the same for the US. There are 11 cities in the US bigger than the 2nd largest in France (Marseille at ~855,000) and 34 bigger than the 3rd largest (Lyon at ~500,000). Second, it does have big Atlantic coastal cities... by French standards. 

Edith Cavell Was A Spy After All Edith Cavell was a British nurse in occupied Belgium during WWI. She was tolerated by the German occupiers as a nurse by helping wounded on both sides, even though it was technically in violation of German occupation law. But she was also smuggling Allied soldiers caught behind the lines out of the war zone via Holland. Cavell was arrested by the Germans and charged with harboring Allied soldiers as well as accusations of using her status as a nurse to spy on the Germans. She confessed to harboring, not to the spying, and was swiftly executed. While there was discussion of pardoning her for her honesty and medical service, the Germans, generally, saw no problem with executing the enemy to protect their soldiers and state. General Moritz Von Bissing, Military Governor of Belgium who signed the warrant for her execution, said... 

I'm going to draw heavily on United States Army in World War II The Western Hemisphere - Guarding the United States and Its Outposts. I would argue the US Army was very quick to adopt radar, just a few years, but events unfolded faster than they could fully integrate their lessons. Rapid Modernization and Expansion In 1941, the US military was still undergoing a rapid modernization and expansion started just a few years before. Everything was being upgraded. New equipment was just being delivered. Everyone was having to very rapidly adapt to the new technology and tactics of WWII. Not everyone adapted well. This report on the state of the Panama Canal defenses lays it all out. 

Then there's the Soviets. They had been asking for a second front for years and were not happy with merely an invasion of Italy. To delay further meant further straining the alliance. A delay might mean the Soviets would seek a separate peace with Germany, and Germany could then turn its full might to defending against invasion. In summer of 1944 the Soviets already had the Germans on the run. If the Western Allies delayed their landing there was a real danger of the Soviets conquering Germany before the Western Allies leaving Germany and all of Eastern Europe under Soviet control.
