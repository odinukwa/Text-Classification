Has anyone examined the relationship between qualia and the fact/value dichotomy? Consider a functional description of pain: Those who disagree with functionalism, typically do so because it leaves out the "what its like" of pain, which also just happens to be what makes pain a bad thing instead of a good thing. Similarly, what makes me prefer maple walnut ice-cream over strawberry ice-cream is the "what its like" of the taste of maple walnut for me, i.e. the qualia of walnut. My questions: 

A common idea in Empiricist schools of thought is that ethical questions can never be based on factual data. Consider Hume's "is-ought" problem or the Logical Positivist notion that ethical statements were non-sensical. It seems to me that this could be easily addressed by the following approach: 

It seems to me very easy to explain care for the dead as an evolutionary spandrel, i.e. an unintended side effect of naturel selection: 

As an after thought, one of my favorite Sci-fi short stories discusses the idea that while logic is indeed subjective, we learn classical logic at a very young age and once we grow into adults, we are incapable of unlearning it. If we were to somehow come across non-classical logics at a very young age, we would be capable of all sorts of superhuman feats. The story is of course, just sci-fi, but I do find the idea compelling. 

Going through the article and looking at the youtube video provided in the OP, it seems that the authors are using purely behavioral criteria to make the claim that their program experiences emotions. In particular, this line stands out: 

Locke and Hume both criticized the indivisibility argument, see the IEP article on the topic. From their point of view, thoughts are divisible, so either a different basis has to be found for why mind and body are different (Locke), or there is no difference between them (Hume). Hume in particular subscribed to the bundle theory of self, the mind is just an illusion constituted by the collection of memories and sensations that a person experiences. On the other hand, one can argue that this criticism of Descartes is unfair, since although divisible in time, thoughts are not divisible in space the way bodies are, and that might be what he was alluding to in his indivisibility argument. 

But modern democracy doesn't work unless there are parties or individuals opposing those who are in power, so is this a unavoidable flaw in democracy? I know that Plato discussed similar conflicts of interest in democracy, but have any modern philosophers discussed similar flaws to democracy? There are many critics of Modern democracy (Habermas for example) but from what I see they all consider that a purer, more authentic form of democracy is possible. Has any contemporary philosopher argued that democracy is inherently flawed, in the same way that Marx has argued that Capitalism is inherently flawed? That democracy cannot be reformed, and some other for of government is necessary if one truly wants to achieve the greater good for society as a whole. 

In the case of stealing from rich companies and giving to the poor, how do you draw the line between companies rich enough that you can steal significant amounts from them without them noticing and those which aren't rich enough or big enough? It is impossible. If you are willing to steal from a large company, then per the categorical imperative, you should be willing to steal from a small Mom & Pop business as well - but that would cause immediate harm to the small family that owns that business and depends on it for survival. So as you can see, your principle can't become a universal law, and per Kant's categorical imperative, is therefor unethical. 

Personally I think that there are many arguments against both terrorism and conventional warfare, but that the biggest argument of all is that no one should make the decision to sacrifice another's life for a cause, no matter how good the cause. If one chooses to risk or sacrifice their own life for a cause, so be it. But the moment someone starts making that decision on behalf of others, both terrorism and conventional warfare loose any legitimacy whatsoever. 

How do hardline libertarians like Nozick and Rand consider the question intellectual property and monopolies through patents? On one hand, it seem to me that they would support the concept, given the importance they place on the freedom to do as one pleases with one's property, and on the freedom to enjoy the fruits of one's talent and labor as one sees fit. On the other hand, restricting free-enterprise through patents and government enforcement, and thwarting free market mechanisms by maintaining monopolies through intellectual property rights seems to go against the general gist of libertarianism. Think of how pharmaceutical companies avoid competition by maintaining monopolies through patents, or how government enforcement was used by corporations to shut down Napster and other peer-to-peer networks. The case of patents is particularly intriguing: If I can deduce the principles of how to construct a device or a medical treatment based on my observation of its working, my knowledge of science and engineering, and my sheer talent, why should I be prevented from constructing a similar one and marketing it? Isn't that an artificial constraint on my freedom to create? Again: I am not interested in a general discussion of these ideas, I am specifically asking how would strong libertarians like Nozick or Rand address this issue? Would they agree that companies have exclusive rights to their intellectual property and patents, or would they take a more anarchic, everyone should be free to do work as they please stance? 

You are correct in assessing that the problem of other minds and Chalmers are similar almost to the point of being different variations of the same fundamental question. In fact we can use an amusing reformulation of the two questions to see to both the similarity and elucidate the difference between them. One could restate the hard problem of consciousness as given by Chalmer using the concept of philosophical Zombies. The hard problem becomes: (a) "Why aren't we philosophical zombies?" While the problem of other minds becomes: (b) "How do I know that everybody else isn't a philosophical Zombie?" The difference between the two now becomes apparent, because it is possible to give a negative answer to (b) while still giving a partially positive answer to (a): "Everybody else is a philosophical Zombie, but at least I am certain, thanks to my subjective experience, that am I not one. From this we can see that the two problems arose in attempted refutations of different, almost completely opposed world views. The problem of other minds discusses the challenges of refuting solipsism (the principle that I am the only mind in the world), which is one step away from subjective idealism (my mind is all there is, there is no external world). Chalmers on the other hand, formulated his hard problem of consciousness as an attempt to refute the physicalist worldview. The impossibility of describing subjective experience in terms of physical variables for him is strong evidence of dualism. To summarize: the two problems are very closely related in that they are both hinged on the difficulty of physically explaining subjective experience. However the two problems are different in that they address completely different issues regarding the mind-body problem. 

GÃ¶del was a member of the Vienna Circle, whose philosophical position as a group was Logical Positivism, or Logical Empiricism. The SEP article on him states that among his philosophical views were realism, rationalism, and Platonism. These all seem to be in radical contradiction with the Logical Positivists anti-realism, empiricism and general disregard for metaphysics. How is it that Godel could hold these views while being a member of the Vienna Circle? 

The Church-Turing-Deutsch principle is a stronger version of the original Church-Turing thesis, that states: 

Descates is trying to prove that we are not in a simulation or dream. He cannot prove it using observation or the senses, since any simulation or dream would mean that what we observe or what we sense is fake. That's the whole point of simulations, dreams and hallucinations: We cannot trust the senses. So instead he tries to prove it using reason and logic alone. That is, he is using a rationalist Approach to prove a fact without having to resort to empirical data. Here's another way of putting it: The skeptic says: "It is possible that everything is an illusion" Descartes responds: "I will show how that is not possible by proving the existence of something without referring to any sense data or observations, using reason alone." 

The psychological arrow of time: The fact that humans can only perceive time as moving in one direction and can only remember the past not the future. The thermodynamic arrow of time: The second law of thermodynamics, that systems move in the direction of increasing disorder (increasing entropy). The cosmological arrow of time: The direction of time moving with the expanding universe. 

Wittgenstein and Russell both moved away from Logical Atomism, and it is generally considered to have failed as a theory of how language connects to truth. However, as an IT person, when I first came into contact with Logical Atomism, its ideas were so obvious and intuitive as to be almost be trivial. I can see the ideas of Logical Atomism embodied in the way programming languages are structured, in the way specification and requirement documentation is written, and in the way legal documents are written. The format of the Tractatus may have seemed weird at the time, but now it is familiar to anyone who has to deal with business documents and complicated installation and user manuals. 

You can never prove that it is immoral. Immorality is only relative to the ethical system chosen. You can however argue, that even for a consequentialist, slavery can still be immoral. 

Some fanatics would respond to your question with: "Exactly, murder isn't wrong." Consider cult leaders who ask their followers to commit mass suicide, or reports from Syria of parents sending their children on suicide missions. However most people who consider themselves religious still consider murder to be a bad thing. A secular response to this is that religious people subconsciously don't really believe in God, even if superficially they think they do. Freud, in "The Future of an Illusion" argues that religious belief is a neurosis, that belief in the supernatural and in an afterlife is just mankind's neurotic reaction to the fear of nature and death. People fool themselves into believing, but only because deep down inside they don't. A related idea is discussed in Plato's "Phaedo": Socrates explains why death is not to be feared. Cebes then points out that if this is the case, then there is nothing wrong with suicide. Socrates agrees that there is an apparent inconsistency, but then argues that it is up to God to decide when we die, not ourselves, hence suicide is wrong. Presumably, the same reasoning applies to murder as well. One might also argue from a strictly utilitarian view point: Killing a child might be good for the child itself, since it will go straight to heaven, but that is offset by the pain and sadness caused to its family, so the net result of murder is still a negative one, and is therefor bad. 

Popper thought that this problem could be solved: It should be possible to tell the difference between (a) reasonable auxiliary hypotheses which help confirm a theory, and (b) unreasonable auxiliary hypotheses which are simply desperate attempts to save a theory which is false. Others, however, believed that it was impossible to completely separate the auxiliary hypotheses from the main hypothesis being tested (See Duhem-Quine thesis). In the above example, one might respond that we are already using Newtonian mechanics to figure out the number of planets in the solar system, so treating the number of planets as an independently testable hypothesis is wrong, and it can't be examined separately from Newton's laws. Kuhn was one of those who saw auxiliary hypotheses as inseparable from the main thesis, and they were all bound together in paradigms (For example Newtonian mechanics is one paradigm, Quantum Mechanics is another, etc...). He argued that these paradigms were driven as much by sociological and historical reasons, as they were by falsification and purely empirical evidence. 

I've always assumed that when Marx said "Religion is the opium of the masses", he meant that religion is a tool used by the ruling classes of the time to dominate the lower classes. But when reading the full original quote: 

Just to complement gonzo's answer, as an illustration of analytic philosophy being more of a method and not really a school of thought with any number of basic positions. Look no further than the fact that Alvin Plantinga, a Christian apologist, and Roger Scruton, whose main work is a defense of the political right, see themselves as analytic descendants of Russell and the LPs, while at the same time there are things such as Analytic Marxism and Analytic Feminism. 

The definition of information you mention is about loss of uncertainty, but more specifically it is about the amount of uncertainty lost, which corresponds to the amount of information gained. There is more uncertainty in the throw of dice than there is in a flip of a coin (1 ou of 6 vs 1 out of 2) , hence a signal carrying the outcome of roll of the dice carries more information than a signal carrying the outcome of a coin toss. From wikipedia: 

Here you are touching on the problem of freewill: A libertarian (one who believes in absolute freewill) would say that such an NPC didn't have freewill and therefore didn't qualify as truly sentient. A compatibilist, believes that agent has freewill as long as it is free to act according to its own internal motivations. In the case of your preprogrammed NPC, they have freewill according to compatibilists, since they are acting according to their own internal motivation, instead of being driven by outside forces. Whether, a compatibilist would make the next step of saying that your NPC is therefore sentient or not depends on who you ask. Daniel Dennett a well know compatibilist would say "yes they do", since he believes that strong AI and sentient robots are possible. 

The argument against functionalism from knowledge In my mind the most detailed argument for why functionalism fails to explain consciousness was provided by Frank Jackson (Jackson, Frank (1986). "What Mary Didn't Know". Journal of Philosophy 83: 291â295). In his original argument, Mary is a Neuroscientist and the sensation in question is color. I will illustrate it with a variation where Mary is a Dentist and the sensation in question is tooth pain, since it is more plausible in my opinion: 

First of all, there are many forms of equality: Racial equality, gender equality, equal opportunity, economic equality, etc...you seem to be mostly concerned with economic equality. Second, based on your wording, you are conflating equality and fairness, which are not the same. In fact many would argue that fairness and equality can be contradictory: Is it fair that all employees get the same pay, even though some work harder than others? Your utility example (better form me to have 2 utility points even if someone else has a 100, than for all of us to each have 1 utility point) echoes John Rawls difference principle. John proposes the theory of Justice as Fairness, discussed in his book "A Theory of Justice". Here, I will quote the SEP article on John Rawls: 

Most entry level philosophy courses tend to focus almost exclusively on Western Philosophy. They also tend to follow a historical narrative that follows the evolution of western thinking, as opposed to studying ideas in themselves as they relate to each other, regardless of who/when they were discovered. For example empiricism is mentioned mainly within the context of British Empiricism, ignoring Indian and Arabic schools which embraced empiricism centuries before Locke or Hume. Similarly, ethics and values courses mention Kant, Mill and then Rawls, and relegate Confucius to Asian Studies and Chinese philosophy courses, when many would argue that his contribution to ethics are just as important. In an era when the vast majority of the earth's population is not of Western decent, this attitude seems dangerously anachronistic, in a way justifying the accusations of cultural imperialism that various contemporary non-Western thinkers make when defending their own ideologies, values, and worldviews. Have there been any anthologies and textbooks or university departments and courses that have tried to overcome this by addressing philosophy as a unified whole? Courses that approached philosophy in an ahistorical topic based way and then brought up the relevant ideas from different geographical and historical contexts? Can we move from a specifically Western Philosophical canon to a more comprehensive and cosmopolitan canon?
