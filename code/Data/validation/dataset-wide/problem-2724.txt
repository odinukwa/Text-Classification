(As a preliminary, it's not "luck" that the belief is justified. The perceptual evidence is the justification in both cases - it's just luck that the belief described is in fact true.) I'd say responding to the cases by looking at what we mean by justification is a pretty standard response to the Gettier cases, and projects like Goldman's Reliabilism or Dretske's Relevant Alternatives restriction can be read as being more strict about what it might take to count as sufficient justification for knowledge claims. But this makes justification the central puzzling question; is justification in a knowledge attribution strictly stronger than justification as "good reason to believe", or stronger still than "reason to hold with a certain credence value"? Do we have a standard notion of justification simpliciter to appeal to? Gettier's cases make a strong argument to the effect that the "True Justified Belief" explanation of knowledge is at best a partial explanation in the absence of a more fine-grained account of (1) what justification is, and (2) the particular role of justification in knowledge. 

You're laboring under a false presumption if you think there's such a thing as a book which will tell you what it is philosopher's do that doesn't include a description of how basic formal arguments work. In a sense, that is how philosophers "do philosophy". To that end, though, I've been greatly enjoying the book The Philosopher's Toolkit. You won't be able to avoid reading about some basics of formal argumentation, but it's proven to be quite good at summarizing the methods. 

Not quite. It's a little easier to read if we make the sets explicit. Let curly braces denote any set, where the name of that set is inside the braces. For instance, set x is {x}. The set's name, followed by a colon, indicates the set's members (separated by commas). Hence if a, b, c are members of set x, we can show this as {x: a,b,c}. Subsets are members of a set. Hence if a law of nature is "any set of worlds that has a subset ", then this is {x: {}}. Let's say that a law of nature at the actual world can be denoted by Li. Then the set of all laws that hold in the actual world (i.e., the world we currently live in) is { L: L1, L2 .., Ln }. Let {} be the set of worlds in which the laws in L and only the laws in L are true. By Van Inwagen's definition, a law of nature just is the set of worlds {Wa} for which is a subset, or {Wa: {}}. That's all. It may still be possible that a different law not in L holds for some other possible world, but then that law would not be a natural one. For instance, say {} is some set of possible worlds for which { S: S1, S2 .., Sn } are not in the actual world. Then S can still be in the set of possible worlds {Wb}. All this means is that if { Wb: {}, {} }, then Wb would still count as a law of nature just like Wa would. { Wc: {} } would be excluded as a law of nature, even if it overlaps with some members from . That is, say a is the actual world, b is a possible world for which all and only L hold true, and c is a possible world where all L and some S holds true. Then any W with members a, b, and c can have the subsets { X: a, b }, { Y: b, c }, and { Z: a, c }. If these were all the possible worlds that exist, then W and X would be natural laws, but Y and Z would not. 

It's unproblematic that such a system can in fact be constructed using Natural Deduction technology to be a logic that properly extends Intutionistic propositional logic. The question is, what additional power does this kind of implication connective give us that we didn't have before? Might it be possible to derive some unusual consequences (such as a collapse into inconsistency)? I'll have a think about that and edit this answer if I can come up with anything. 

The Stoics argued that the correct approach to Passions, being emotional states of being where the mind is specifically moved to act in a way contrary to reason, nature or virtue, is to recognise them through a life of practiced philosophical self-awareness and to thereby be equipped to resist their influence. This seems very much in line with eastern ideas of mindfulness. 

Empiricism in its most general form is the claim that all we can possibly know about the world and the laws which govern it are those things which we can directly apprehend by our senses. Hence, the very idea that objects continue to exist, unchanging, when no one's observing them, or that it is a law of nature that any event must precede and cause another, cannot be observed and can neither be known. This is a very rough approximation, because you asked for it. Kant's argument against this, can be roughly (again, very roughly) approximated as follows: any presumption that our senses can provide us with any information about the world, already must assume that the sense itself is caused, or it would be unable to provide us with real knowledge. Thus there is at least one law of nature which cannot be observed, defeating the general claim of empiricism. I'm not confident that this kind of stripped-down explanation can really deliver a accurate account of what Kant attempted in this argument, but as long as you're aware of the limitations and dangers in trying to eliminate the details here, it should suffice. For reference, see the IEP entry on the topic, which gives slightly more detail over the version I've tried to provide here. 

No no no no no. No. Points and places do not work that way. An element of a set X is considered a point when one defines a topological space over that set. The point is not itself created any more than sets themselves are created - what happens rather is that one brings to the table an additional series of subdivisions of the totality of elements we're interested in to serve as a Topology, and it is in virtue of the subdivisions we accept that we consider something a point. Is it possible to define a topological space that might totally trivialize all the points and collapse any kind of distinction there? Of course it is - the topology can simply consist of the full set X and the empty set as the only partitions it admits. But this isn't an act of creating new points - rather it's just a conscious choice to filter out any other more fine-grained forms of individuated sets that might form a more interesting or complicated basis for our topology. What you seem to be doing is asserting without proof or clarification that one is confined to viewing all forms of topology within the confines of a two-dimensional and discrete case. But mathematicians have a logical technology that lets them work around the difficulties of standard first order theory with reference to Neighbourhoods. The language of Set theory allows us to identify and characterise subspaces, within which individual points can be quantified over as part of the open sets that make up the topology over our space. Since these subspaces can be individuated in set theory and reasoned about, the functions we appeal to can act without fixing on particular points that we want to position in exact places without thereby giving up on the idea that the topology is itself composed of individual points. So with a language of continuous functions over topological spaces, there is indeed a way to describe spaces using our discretely based language that do not collapse into point singletons; moreover it's an immensely rich language that gives us access to such a diversity of ways of explaining the spaces we find ourselves in and the surfaces we find ourselves on. The key is not assuming that the only two things that matter are everything and nothing. 

The denial of u1's antecedent, "if you study, you will graduate" is certainly not implied. However, using u2's construction in english often (not always) indicates that the exact same word to be taken in a stronger sense. Rather than "if not", we read this stronger sense as "if and only if not". To illustrate, rewriting both examples to use the more familiar logical indicators results in the following clauses: 

In the spirit of providing an answer to your question rather than adding to the pile of everyone's favorite philosophically-minded movies, please a take a moment to review The Cognitive Science Movie Index. Although the aim is CogSci and not philosophy specifically, it could be argued that all cinema is anyway always already a reflection of philosophy. Since you mentioned Waking Life specifically, and indicated your interest was directed more at movies with explicit or more immediately relevant themes and concepts, The Index will likely be right up your alley— Waking Life is included in the list as well, and there is a severe amount of overlap between the fields. The site was originally referred to me by Rob Goldstone at a conference on just such a crossover, regarding the concept of cognitive penetration. I'd recommend to anyone interested in this question, adding your own finds to the list and helping it grow. 

I believe your analysis of "logic" is in error. Logic isn't the study of reasoning as such (which is the domain of Psychology) but rather the study of validity (or equivalently Consequence). Validity isn't constrained by human reasoning, but by the world. We have theories of logic, which we construct in our attempts to process the world and help us to make something intelligible out of what we encounter and observe, but validity itself is something we theorize about and that we latch on to by virtue of our evolutionary adaptation to it, rather than something we as human agents either have as a cognitive tool or as an inherited trait. God might well be beyond the scope of human reasoning, but that alone isn't sufficient to support the claim that God is beyond logic, which would require the further premise that God is not part of the world. 

"Fallacy spotting" seems to be in vogue at the moment, but remember that accusing someone of committing a fallacy is just a way of saying that person has failed to provide a logically valid argument. Applying false premises to a validly formed argument is not fallacious, it simply means the argument is not sound, which is also to say that the argument fails. So to assert that another's argument is ridiculous and hence wrong with no further supporting evidence may be true or false, but as a single premise there is no further argument and cannot, by definition, be fallacious. 

I'm not terribly good with economic theory, but it seems a little unjust that no one was able to step up on this one last year. Still, it deserves an answer. ... If we took only the reason that "a [flat] tax contributes to the welfare of the Netherlands", then it's fairly obvious that this is not a capitalist concern, and certainly doesn't pick out enough of a difference between individuals by the definition you've provided, that "Everybody should be rewarded [by] their [...] contribution." That tricky word you included "equally", in reference to capitalism, means to say that each person should receive some benefit equal to their contribution, not equal to everyone else. It gets problematic once you include that clause which states the Netherlands will be benefitted "because there is a direct relation between someone's contributions and his net reward" (emphasis added). My concern here is that when I look up "flat tax", it does seem to imply equal treatment in the strictly capitalist sense, specifically because it rewards greater productivity in just the way that your question claims is the reason it benefits the Netherlands on the whole. There's no sense that this involves anything other than a very capitalist sort of view. ... So honestly? I think you're absolutely right. Your guide's answer 'D' may have simply been a typo, and you should check with the author or editor. The question's also a bit wonky without the text it's taken from to define what kind of tax it means by saying "flat tax." I'm inferring the meaning from the definition that your question gives. However, if it's taken to mean a strict flat marginal rate, then it ceases to have the same capitalist qualities - but then it would satisfy choice A, not D. So I can't really say. On the other hand, can any version of the "Flat tax" possibly be utilitarian? That's an entirely different question, and one I'm not really capable of answering. I'm inclined to say that it could be construed as utilitarian, but only on the premise that capitalism benefits all at the expense of the individual. Yet that still presupposes capitalist justice (by your definition) as the motivating reason. 

Propositional functions seem to be understood in terms of formal relationships between the different parts of a properly logical symbolic language. The problem we might have now is as to what, strictly speaking, we ought to say about the foundations of proper logical structure and the idea of a logical particle, and you're right to point out that without some sort of model theory, Propositional functions seem completely mysterious. There doesn't seem to be any particular consensus on what Russell had in mind in terms of what they really are (see the SEP article on this issue). But reading Russell as a Structural Realist may give some clues as to how someone trying to renew his philosophical project might be able to think about the nature of propositions and propositional functions. Russell's Principia stipulates what logical statements there are and how they relate through his axiom systems. A Structural Realist might say that when we engage with the world, what we are engaging with is its axiomatically systemic nature, which we take to be "the same as" our logical language. We build and work with axiomatic theories of the propositional structure of the world by relying on Principia's specifications of logical structures. And as such, ontology is strictly subordinate to logical specification. Actually, structures are "out there" as realized in the empirically observed world too (in as much as the idea of an "out there" makes sense in Russell's metaphysics; it would be probably more technically accurate but much less charitable to say the structure is "just there"), but in order to further evaluate some structure as an object, we would need to logically situate it inside another axiomatic theory to give us its objects and functions. (This can in principle be done, since Type theory is hierarchical, but the behaviour of higher types or a type/category of "fictions" isn't very well specified by Russell's theory) The question of "what we say" about propositional functions and individual bare particulars beyond what prior specified logical axioms can tell us would be thus easily answered: "nothing at all". (The structuralist strategy and some consequences of it for maths received much more attention after Paul Benacerraf's arguments in "What Numbers could not be" (1965)) If this is what we're committed to, we can still get propositions and propositional functions out of it at the end, because that's how logic seems to work, but their identities are in some sense parasitic on how the world is "organized" into facts. Had the world been radically different, with more complicated types than we currently think there are, the identities of propositions and propositional functions might also have been different. That may be a step too far for anyone looking for logical structure to serve as a stable foundation. (all quote marks are scare quotes, and not necessarily Russell's own terminology.) 

That Second Part of Your Question I Nearly Glossed Over The reason we see so much prior philosophy in training isn't because we make no progress, but because they're proven training materials. There is no yardstick to measure what counts as progress in philosophy by. We're not really in the business of inventing new ideas (that would make us artists), and certainly not in the business of making new predictions. If there's any progress in philosophy at all, it's individual. Progress for a philosopher can best be measured by every new perspective he or she can bring to bear on any concept. But insofar as humanity comes up with new false concepts, such as linking race with behavior, or justice as the majority opinion, or pain and joy as unreal— we'll be there. Not so much defending something known to be true, but tearing down everything false. Just don't blame us if we pull down everything wrong in the world, and then find out there's nothing left behind it.
