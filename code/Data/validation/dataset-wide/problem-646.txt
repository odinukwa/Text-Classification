Based on the spec on Bikepedia, I bought a 68x113mm, and finally got around to going to the bike co-op yesterday to replace this. Much to my annoyance, when I got the old BB out, it turns out it was in fact 118mm, as suggested at the forum post I linked in my question. I've accepted Nathan's answer since it's a good generic guide to figuring out your BB length, but I've added this update for anyone looking for the specific BB size for the 2010 Tricross just so it's on the record. 

Not to be trite, but: Get out there and ride! I just tried out a 29 Plus mountain bike a few months ago, first time on a MTB in years. Felt really weird and disorienting at first, so I just rode on smooth gravel pathways for a while. Once I started feeling a bit more confident in it, I started going out of my way to run over small rocks, twigs, branches, etc., to get a feel for how the bike responds. Quickly built up to "cinder-block" size rocks (breeze-blocks if you're in the UK). It was really fun "relearning" - it's the first time in a long I've felt like a little kid on a bike. There's no rush, nobody's going to appear out of the bushes to laugh at you when you decide to go around a larger obstacle that you're not yet confident rolling over. It's not clear from your post what your level of experience is, but if you're feeling really nervous and cautious, just ride on a pavement for a few days. Try rolling off curbs (check for cars first!). Try rolling along on some grass. Have fun with it! 

Try this: remove the pedals, clean the threads with an old rag, apply a small amount of grease to the threads. Put them back in and tighten up quite firmly. See if clicking disappears. I find I have to do that every 2-4,000 km or so. Don't forget left pedal is threaded the opposite of "normal". 

Echoing Chris's comment, if "well-suited" means you're literally wearing a suit jacket, the backpack may make the back of the jacket sweaty and/ or crumpled. However, 5km is a VERY short bike commute, so if you take care to smooth the jacket back under the backpack after putting it on, and ride slowly on the way to work, you'll probably be OK. As a point of reference, I ride 25-27km each way to work with a backpack, averaging about 25km/h. However, I wear bike shorts and jersey and I'm sweaty mess by the end. So I definitely wouldn't want to do it in a suit. If I had to do it in a suit and couldn't shower at work, I'd drop my speed to about 15-18km/h on the way to work to not be totally sweaty when I got there. If you want minimize the likelihood of jacket crumpling and back sweat, you could think about getting a large shallow front or back basket that you could carefully fold the jacket and lay it in. It won't have time for the wrinkles to settle in in just 5km. Also, Chris makes a good point about trouser hem: make sure you get some pants straps or clips to keep your trousers away from the chain. Even a single light brush against the chain will leave a nasty grease smear on anything other than black trousers. One more thought: most people who dress formally for work have a small number of jackets that they pair with a larger variety of shirts. Could you leave your jacket(s) at work, ride there in just your button up shirt and trousers, reducing sweating greatly, and then just put the jacket on when you get there? 

If you haven't already done so, I would try tightening it back up all the way, then unscrew it again, just to see if that loosens it up. I had something similar happen a while back while using a CO2 canister. Couldn't get the thingamajig to press in, so after trying to manually press it in with my thumb, I then tried pushing on it with the side of the CO2 canister at which point it simply snapped off. Then it wouldn't hold any air and I had to walk about 2 k in bike shoes to a LBS. 

Since posting this question I went on a tour for a few months which involved flying with my bike twice. Both times it was packed in a cardboard bike box from a bike shop. It may have been unclear in my original question, but my question was specifically about the disc rotors, not how to pack a bike in general. When searching elsewhere I found there was lots of info about general bike packing, e.g. remove the rear derailleur wrap it in padding, use a dummy axle for the fork, etc, but I didn't find a lot of info on disc brakes. Anyway, to be safe I removed the rotors, interleaved them with sheets of clean paper towel to avoid contamination (so three sheets total), then sandwiched them between two squares of press-board, which I then wrapped with duct tape. This may indeed be overkill but I'm sure it can't hurt. To keep the torx screws safe, I put them back in the holes they go in and screwed them in a few rotations. When I put the brakes back on I did not use any special alignment tool or torque wrench, I just used the torx driver on my multi-tool and put them in by hand. 

I had the exact same issue on my bike last year. Drove me crazy. Only happened when pedaling and rate of clicks depended on cadence, was not changed by gears. Turned out to be slightly dry/loose pedal threads, i.e. where the pedal spindle threads into the crank arm, not the inernal bearings of the pedal itself: 

My drivetrain has 10,000km on it at the moment and the chain and cassette are more than due for replacement. The middle chainring looks badly worn to me and I'm going to replace it as well. I'm wondering if I should replace the large and/or small chainrings as well, particularly the large which is more expensive than the other two combined. The photos below should show the wear on all three chainrings. I'm hoping someone can offer advice on the large/small chainrings based on the photos. If it helps, of the 10,000km on these chainrings, I would estimate less than 500km of that is on the smallest ring, and probably less than 2,000km on the largest ring. I'm mostly a middle-ring rider. Thanks. Middle and Large Chainrings: 

From some quick reading about removing/installing thru axle wheels, literally all the guides I see are describing quick release variants of the thru axle. Does it mean anything that mine is not quick release? Does that indicate poor quality/ cheapness? Or is it just that fat bike axels are rarer due to their width and not many quick release variants exist? If I remove and install it with a normal allen key, how concerned do I need to be about the torque rating (80-120 in lbs)? Can I just put it in to finger tight plus a half turn or something like that? Or should I buy a torque wrench for this? I don't want my wheel popping off (too loose), but I also don't want to crush my carbon fork (too tight). Maybe there's a metal internal sleeve to prevent the latter. I just removed it and checked the tightness before doing so, and I would call it on the tighter end of what you could do with a standard allen key. Can I replace this with a quick release axle? If so, what are the measurements that matter in picking a replacement? The specs for this bike say 150mm fork spacing, but the axle itself has three numbers: L=198mm, TL=9mm, TP=M15x1.5. 

You could try a DIY custom fiberglass tool compartment for that area. Take a block of styrofoam, whittle/ carve it into the perfect shape to fit that area for your specific bike/bottle combo, then use that as a mold to wrap 1-2 layers of fiberglass around (using a fiber glass repair kit from automotive store), then cut the end or top off that, and you have a container for the space. Figure out how to waterproof the seem around the cut, add velcro straps to your seat and down tube. For the repair kits, you can buy them from automotive stores or Amazon and a small repair kit probably includes enough fiber to do a small project like this. The kits I have in mind are in the $20-40 USD range. Example: Resin Cloth If you wanted it to be a little more slick and/or lightweight, there are also DIY carbon fiber kits and carbon fiber mold kits. You're looking about 3-4x the cost of the fiberglass kits. 

Recently, after mis-reading "35-65 PSI" on a tire sidewall as "35-85 PSI" (in retrospect the unusually huge range should have tipped me off), I inflated a tire rated for 65PSI max to 80PSI. A few minutes later it blew off quite violently, giving me quite the fright. Now I'm nervous about using the tire again, wondering if it will blow off again more easily now, etc. So my question is a) would you generally continue to use a tire that has blown off a rim once or is best to chuck it, and b) what aspects of the tire and rim would you inspect and what are you looking for to determine if it's safe to keep using the tire? The one I mentioned looks like the rubber around the bead is a little roughed up but not terrribly so. I'll add a picture when I get home. Thanks. 

Are the mounting posts and position for road disc brake calipers the same as or similar enough to mountain bike disc calipers that you could put a set of road disc brakes on a mountain bike or vice-versa? I'm aware that this generally requires road brake levers, and that you also need to make sure any drop bar levers are compatible with your derailleurs. However, my question here is narrowly about how you would convert the brakes of a disc-equipped mountain bike to something drop bar compatible. If that can be done, what are the downsides to be aware of? 

As some of the comments pointed out, saying something like "it's not economically viable to bike" is sometimes a cover for "I'm scared to bike" or some other concern. Lots of ppl are scared to bike for various reasons. Scared of being hit by car, or the more self-conscious fear of trying out a new physical activity in a public sphere, or just unsure about how to plan a new route by bike (I know someone at my work who bought a nice bike but then procrastinated for months on riding to work because she didn't know how to get through our downtown core and onto the main bike path to work), etc. Also, many ppl may feel they don't know if they're going to like cycling and may not want to make the big investment to figure it out. I.e. what if they spend $500 on a bike, try it a few times only to discover they hate it, and are then out the cost of a bike? If you encounter someone in any of these situations, and know/trust them well enough, consider loaning them a spare bike if you have one for a few days to try it out. Also, offer to ride with them if you can rework your route to do so. You can show them how to plan a route (bike layers on Google maps, etc.), how to ride safely in traffic, use hand signals, etc, making them feel more comfortable riding. And they get to test out biking without an immediate financial commitment. 

The big black dial is your standard inline cable tension adjustment, so yes, the same as a normal V-Brake. Based on the description here, it appears the red dial is the "Speed Dial" adjustment outlined below. If I understand correctly, this is for changing modulation so the same lever can be used with either linear pull cantilevers or disc brakes. 

Velib makes the most sense for you. The use case you outlined is exactly what bike shares were designed for: short point to point trips where you don't necessarily expect or need to take the exact same bike back with you. Check out the prices: 

I just got a new bike with SRAM Level Hydraulic disc brakes. After riding it home, I noticed both the front and rear brakes have a silver linchpin holding something in place. It almost looks like it's holding the pads in place, but also kinda looks like it's supposed to be removed. 

Echoing Daniel's question in the comments above, when you're doing your twice-weekly air top-up, and you first connect your pump to the tire, and before you start pumping, what does it read? That will give us an idea of how much air they're losing between each top-up. Also, I'll second Chris's suggestion of larger tires. Going to a 28-30mm tire will make them way less likely to pinch flat, much more forgiving of not being at "ideal" pressure, and the ride will be way more pleasant (less harsh). The small downside is a slight reduction in efficiency, but unless you're racing somewhat seriously, I wouldn't worry about that, and for a 6 mile commute that really shouldn't hurt you. If it helps put your mind at ease, my commute is about 15 miles each way and recently I've been mostly doing it on 42mm all-road tires running around 50PSI. They're definitely a bit slower, but we're talking like 2-5 minutes reduction on a 60 minute one-way commute. Going from 25mm to 28mm on a 6mile commute, I'd be surprised if you could measure a 30 second reduction in average commute time. 

If this helps at all, I used a set of Marathon Plus tires on a cross-Canada tour last year (8200km), plus a bunch of commutting, totaling about 11,000km. I did not get any flats at any point, but by the end of that distance, the rear tire was pretty bald and I decided to stop using it. Here's a picture of the tires around 10,000km, front tire on the left rear on the right. I consider the rear tire bald here since the part actually contacting the road has none of the factory tread remaining. 

Interesting question! Embrocation sounds very gimmicky to me but I don't race. I wonder if the effect is like drinking hard liquour when you're cold, which a lot of ppl think warms you up. In reality alcohol is also a vasodilator, pushing blood to the surface of your skin and making you feel warmer. This is contrary to what your body is trying to do in cold weather, which is maintain core temperature. So arguably, vasodilation could be a good thing in a controlled and not-too-cold scenario, e.g. cycling in cold weather, where you want your muscles and skin warm, and are not concerned about hypothermia. But it's probably to be avoided in seriously cold scenarios, although at such times you're probably no longer relying on embrocation for warmth but instead full-on thermal leggings or snow pants. 

(your bridge in red, two bike friendly bridges in purple) Zooming in on the right hand option, and going to streetview, it has a separated two way bike lane which is quite pleasant: 

Can you service (i.e. fully remove and replace) a Square Taper English Threaded Bottom Bracket without removing the chain and/or front derailleur? Ditto for other BB types if the answer varies by BB type. Picturing it in my head, the drive side crank arm will take the chainrings and therefore chain with it as it is pulled, but the front derailleur wants to keep the chain where it is. If you manually pop the chain onto successively smaller rings, and then right off the smallest one as you pull the crank arm, then I think the chain will just hang off the derailleur, out of the way, giving you full access to the BB. Am I missing anything? Thanks. 

I wouldn't do it myself, but for what it's worth, I met a buy biking across Canada last year on a Cervelo TT bike. He was pretty out there though. He was a former bike courier who decided he wanted to do a bike tour then get into time trialing, and rather than buy two separate bikes for the two tasks, he just bought a TT bike. Repainted it with a hatchet motif, swapped out the fork for another carbon one that had mid-fork eyelets (I'm guess Specialized Tricross), put front panniers and some frame bags on the thing, zip-tied a hatchet to the frame and off he went. You can check out his setup here: $URL$ So it can definitely be done. Whether you'll enjoy the ride as much as your buddies who are on touring bikes or even just endurance road bikes, is another question.
