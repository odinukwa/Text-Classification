A commutative analogue of the conjecture that the only projective D-affine varieties are homogeneous spaces is a generalization of Harthshorne conjecture. The latter (famously proved by Mori) characterizes projective spaces as the only smooth projective varieties with ample tangent bundles. It is expected that the only smooth projective varieties whose tangent bundle is big and nef are homogeneous spaces of reductive groups, this conjecture is apparently due to Demailly and Campana-Peternell. 

Let $X$ be a complete smooth curve over $\mathbb C$ and $A=Jac[2]$ be the group of 2-torsion elements in the Jacobian of $X$. Is their a relation between: 1) The $A$-torsor of $\theta$-characteristics and its decomposition into odd and even parts. 2) The projective action of $A$ on sections of ${\mathcal O}_{Jac}(2\Theta)$, where $\Theta$ is the $\Theta$-divisor, lifting to a Heisenberg group action. 

Let $\mathcal M_m\subset M(2,\mathbb Z)$ be the set matrices with determinant $n$. The modular group $\Gamma$ acts on $\mathcal M_m$ from the left and we have the following finite set as a set of representatives of the orbits of this action $$\mathcal M_n^*=\bigg\lbrace \begin{pmatrix}a &b\\ 0 & d \end{pmatrix}:ad=m,0\leq b\leq d\bigg\rbrace.$$ Consider the modular equation $$\Phi_m(X,j(z))=\prod_{M\in\mathcal M_m^*}\left(X-j(Mz)\right).$$ It is straightforward to prove that this is actually a polynomial in two variables $\Phi_m(X,Y)$. Zagier shows in his notes, p. 71, that the leading coefficient of $\Phi_m(X,X)$ is invertible if $m$ is not a square. He also demonstrates that $j(z)$ is a root of $\Phi_m(X,X)$ if and only if $z$ is fixed by some matrix $M$ with determinant $m$. Zagier proceeds to show that for $z\in\mathfrak H$ a complex multiplication point of discriminat D, i.e. $Az^2+Bz+C=0$, $D=B^2-4AC$, $(A,B,C)=1$ the folowing two statements are equivalent: 

The group $SL(2,F)$ where $F$ is a local nonArchemidian field is hyperbolic. Various generalizations of the notion of hyperbolicity have been studied in the literature (I've seen terms like "hierarchically hyperbolic", "relatively hyperbolic" etc.). Which of those classes do groups of the form $G(F)$ where $G$ is semi-simple of higher rank fall into? 

Let $G$ be a complex simple simply connected algebraic group and $Gr_G$ be the corresponding affine Grassmannian (it is well known that $Gr_G$ is homotopy equivalent to the base loop space $\Omega K$ of the maximal compact subgroup $K\subset G$). Let $H=H^*(Gr,k)=H^*(\Omega K,k)$ be the cohomology ring where $k$ is a field of characteristic $p>0$. The computation of $H$ by Yun and Zhu in their paper "Integral homology of loop groups..." shows that the commutative $k$-algebra $H$ has a divided power structure, at least when $p$ is not too small. Can this be seen from first principles? In particular, is it related to Cartan's divided power structure on homology of a commutative simplicial $k$-algebra? 

Thus if $0\neq z \in \mathbb C$ is a root of $\Psi_n(x,x)=0$ then we must have for some $\omega$ and $M=\bigl(\begin{smallmatrix} r & s \\ 0 & t \end{smallmatrix} \bigr)\in S(n,3)$ \begin{equation} z=\gamma_2(\omega)=\gamma_2(M\omega) \end{equation} and consequently by the fourth paragraph \begin{equation} \frac{a\omega+b}{c\omega+d}=\frac{r\omega+s}{t} \end{equation} where $a,b,c,d$ are integers such that $ad-bc=1$ and $ab-ac+cd-a^2cd \equiv 0 \ (\textrm{mod}\ 3)$. Hence $\omega$ is a root of a quadratic equation with integral coefficients, and if $n$ is suitably chosen, then the middle coefficient will be divisible by $3$. Conversely if we can find $\bigl( \begin{smallmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{smallmatrix} \bigr)$ and $\bigl(\begin{smallmatrix} r & s \\ 0 & t \end{smallmatrix} \bigr) $ with these properties, $\gamma_2(\omega)$ will be a root of $\Psi_n(x,x)=0$ On the other hand the roots of the equation \begin{equation} x^3-j(\omega)=0 \end{equation} are \begin{equation} \gamma_2(\omega),\ e^{-2\pi i/3}\gamma_2(\omega)=\gamma_2(\omega+1),\ e^{2\pi i/3}\gamma_2(\omega)=\gamma_2(\omega-1) \end{equation} If we could guarantee that the only common root of $\Psi_n(x,x)$ and $x^3-j(\omega)$ is $\gamma_2(\omega)$, then we would know that $\gamma_2(\omega)$ and $j(\omega)$ had the same degree. But if $A$ is not divisible by $3$, $B$ is divisible by $3$ and \begin{equation} A\omega^2+B\omega+C=0,\ (A,B,C)=1. \end{equation} then it is easy to see that the numbers $\omega + 1$ and $\omega -1$ satisfy quadratic equations whose middle coefficients are not divisible by $3$. Therefore $\gamma_2(\omega)$ is the only common root and we are done. Finally, my question is this: given $\omega\in H$ such that $\omega^2+3\omega+\frac{9-D}{4}=0$ where $D\equiv 5 \ (\textrm{mod} \ 8)$ and $D<0$ is not divisible by 3, how can I find $n\equiv -1 \ (\textrm{mod}\ 3)$ and $M\in S(n,3)$ such that $$A\omega=M\omega$$ holds for some $A=\bigl( \begin{smallmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{smallmatrix} \bigr)\in\Gamma$ satisfying $ab-ac+cd-a^2cd \equiv 0 \ (\textrm{mod}\ 3)$? 

Is there an analogue of Kac-Weisfeiler conjecture (a theorem of Premet) on the power of p dividing dimension of an irreducible representation for Lie algebras of Cartan type? Benkart and Feldvoss mention this as an open problem (Problem 10) in their 2015 survey, but they don't seem to state a precise conjecture. 

Does Hochschild cohomology of a cocommutative Hopf algebra over a field of positive characteristic have a natural divided power structure? If not, perhaps a certain natural extra structure on the Hopf algebra would yield one? 

The parametrization \eqref{2} can be deduced, quite laboriously, using Weierstrass elliptic functions and the product expansion for $\Delta$. However, when we clear the denominators, equation \eqref{1} (possibly) becomes an identity between modular forms and such identities should be easy to prove using the fact, that the space of modular forms has a finite dimension. Can this be done? What can we say about $\Delta(2\tau)$? It is a modular form with respect to some group? 

Is every vector bundle on an algebraic torus $T=({\mathbb A}^1\setminus \{0\})^n$ over an algebraically closed field trivial? I am primarily interested in the case of a characteristic zero base field. 

Let $X$ be a smooth closed subvariety in a complex projective space and $Z\subset X$ be a generic hyperplane section. Lefschetz hyperplane section Theorem says that the restriction map $H^i(X)\to H^i(Z)$ is an isomorphism for $i<dim(Z)$ and injective for $i=dim(Z)$. I am interested in examples when it's also an isomorphism $i=dim(Z)$. This is equivalent to saying that Fourier-Deligne transform of the intersection cohomology sheaf of the cone over $X$ has less than full support in the dual space (then this support has to be the cone over the projectively dual variety $X^*$). This is so when $X$ is an even dimensional quadric; are there other examples? 

I have a question which is fairly elementary, but first I must provide relevant context. Without it, my question would seem rather arbitrary and scarcely interesting. Note also that my question can be answered without reading what follows. Let $j(\omega)$ be the modular invariant, $\Gamma$ be the modular group and $H$ the upper half-plane. Define $\gamma_2(\omega)=\sqrt[3]{j(\omega)}$ using the cube root which is real on the imaginary axis. Let $\tau\in H$ satisfy \begin{equation} A\tau^2+B\tau+C=0,\ (A,B,C)=1. \end{equation} By Class field theory the value $j(\tau)$ is an algebraic integer of degree exactly $h(D)$, where $D=B^2-4AC$. Since $\gamma_2(\tau)^3-j(\tau)=0$ one would expect the degree of $\gamma_2(\tau)$ to be $3h(D)$. But it turns out that, if $(A,3)=1$ and $3\mid B$, the degree of $\gamma_2(\tau)$ is also $h(D)$. Now I indicate how this result can be proved. Set $\varepsilon=e^{-\frac{2\pi i}{3}}$. It can be shown that for $\bigl( \begin{smallmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{smallmatrix} \bigr)\in\Gamma$ we have \begin{equation} \gamma_2{\left(\frac{a\omega+b}{c\omega+d}\right)}=\varepsilon^{ab-ac+cd-a^2cd}\gamma_2(\omega). \end{equation} This implies that $\gamma_2(\omega)=\gamma_2(\tau)$ if and only if $A\omega=\tau$, with $A=\bigl( \begin{smallmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{smallmatrix} \bigr)\in\Gamma$ satisfying $ab-ac+cd-a^2cd \equiv 0 \ (\textrm{mod}\ 3)$, except when $\omega \equiv e^{-\frac{2\pi i}{3}} \ (\textrm{mod}\ \Gamma)$, in which case $\gamma_2(\omega)=0$. Next define \begin{equation} S(n,3)=\bigg\lbrace\begin{pmatrix} r & s\\ 0 & t \end{pmatrix}:rt=n,r>0,(r,s,t)=1,3\mid s,0\leq s <3t \bigg\rbrace. \end{equation} Let $\omega$ be in the upper half-plane $H$. Consider the polynomial \begin{equation} \phi_{n,\omega}(x)=\prod_{M\in S(n,3)}\left(x-\gamma_2(M\omega)\gamma_2(\omega)^{-n} \right). \end{equation} It takes some work to show that the coefficients of this polynomial are invariant under $\Gamma$, and therefore rational functions in $j(\omega)$. After additional work we conclude that they are in fact polynomials with integral coefficients. In this way we get a polynomial $\Phi_n(x,y)\in \mathbb Z[x,y]$ such that $\Phi_n(x,j(\omega))=\phi_{n,\omega}(x)$. Applying a suitable substitution we obtain another polynomial $\Psi_n(x,y)\in \mathbb Z[x,y]$ satisfying for all $0\neq z \in \mathbb C$ 

Is there a theorem (or theorems) that can be thought of a real analogue of Weil conjectures? One can replace the finite field by real numbers and Frobenius by complex conjugation; counting points can perhaps be replaced by Euler characteristic or a more refined invariant of the set of real points. Of course, Lefschetz fixed point formula can be applied here, but is there something more specific one can say? 

It's a toric variety, for which intersection cohomology is computed algorithmically, see e.g. De Catldo's lectures. 

Let $\Gamma$ be the modular group and $\mathcal M_n$ the set of all primitive matrices with determinant $n\geq1$. Recall that a primitive matrix has relatively prime entries. The modular group $\Gamma$ acts on the set $\mathcal M _n$ from the left. The representatives of the orbits of this action can be chosen as $$S(n)=\bigg \lbrace \begin{pmatrix}r &s\\0&t\end{pmatrix}:r>0,rt=n,(r,s,t)=1,0\leq s<t\bigg\rbrace.$$ One encounters this, for example, when studying the modular equation $\Phi_n(X,X)$. Cf. Zagier, p. 68. Now consider a generalization of $S(n)$, namely $$\mathcal{S}\left(n,d\right)=\bigg\lbrace \begin{pmatrix}r &s\\0&t\end{pmatrix}: r>0,rt=n,(r,t,s)=1,d \mid s, 0 \leq s < dt\bigg\rbrace.$$ These sets arise from the study of modular functions for certain subgroups of $\Gamma$ and their transformation equations. My question is this: is there some set of matrices $\mathcal M_{n,d}$ and a subgroup $\Gamma_{n,d}\subset\Gamma$ such that $S(n,d)$ is a set of representatives for the orbits of the left action $\Gamma_{n,d}\backslash\mathcal M_n$? 

There are various definitions of boundary of a hyperbolic group. Which of those generalize to semi-hyperbolic groups (in the sense of Alonso and Bridson)? The example I have in mind is a semisimple group over a nonArchemedian local field.The answer I'd like to get is something like a nonHausdorff space which is a union of partial flag manifolds $G/P$ (which can be described as the quotient of the complement to $G$ in the De Concini-Procesi compactification by the right action of $G$).
