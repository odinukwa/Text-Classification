You can do rock, ice, and glacier travel in any order, or learn any subset of these skills that you wish. They overlap a lot, because they all involve a lot of the same roped climbing skills and anchor building skills. First aid training is great, but this is really more of a general life skill. Even if you take a wilderness first aid course, you're more likely to use the skills when you're in your home or at work. 

Freedom of the Hills is a book about mountaineering, not rock climbing. They overlap somewhat, but they're basically different things. Rock climbing can mean a lot of very different things: climbing on top-rope in a gym; lead-climbing in a gym; outdoor sport climbing; and outdoor trad climbing (which has different roles for the leader and follower). Mountaineering is basically an extension of hiking, and mountaineering includes lots and lots of different types of skills and activities. Some of these you can learn on your own, but others (e.g., self-arrest with an ice ax) you're better off getting professional instruction in. All forms of rock climbing (with the exception of free-soloing, which is probably not something you should try as a beginner) require a climbing partner, so no, you cannot learn rock climbing all by yourself. 

Freezer bag cooking eliminates the hassle and environmental impact of washing your pot and dishes. You simply boil the water in the pot, then pour it into the ziplock freezer bag where the ingredients are. You eat out of the bag, so you don't need to carry separate dishes that are heavy and have to be washed. If you're using this technique, then the only criteria for a cooking pot are size, weight, and cost. You don't have to worry about even heat distribution, cleaning off burned food, or the pot material leaching into your food. If you have the bucks, titanium is optimal. If you use an alcohol stove with clean-burning alcohol, you don't get all that black soot on the pot, either. It may take a little trial and error to find a source of alcohol that burns cleanly. Alcohol stoves are also really nice because the fuel is lightweight, and if you spill or leak fuel, it's inoffensive and relatively nontoxic, and evaporates completely. I find that about 6 oz of fuel is enough for me for several days. The only reason I use any other type of stove anymore is if I'm snow camping and need to melt snow. 

I'm signed up for an AMGA single-pitch instructor course (to learn how to teach other people single-pitch climbing). One of the pieces of gear we're supposed to bring is a 30 meter static rope "for setting up big 'v' anchors." I don't own one, and the instructor says I can borrow one, so it's not a problem for me, but it makes me wonder why this would be considered such a fundamental piece of gear. If I'm understanding the application correctly, the idea would be to extend the anchor so that a toprope doesn't have to go over the lip of a cliff, or allow the construction of anchors in which the pro is widely spaced. I would normally have used 1-inch webbing for this purpose. Why would one prefer a static rope rather than webbing for this purpose? It's more expensive, and a 30 m length would not be useful for other applications such as canyoneering. What are the pros and cons? 

So any sunglasses are better than nothing, polarizing sunglasses are quite good, and sunglasses with both a polarizing filter and a UV filter are better. However, you may have a very difficult time finding out whether the glasses you buy really are what they claim to be. 

"Unlikely" is not the same as "won't happen." You're going to the White Mountains in California, so call the ranger station in Bishop and ask them. They will probably tell you that bears do exist there, so the probability is not zero. "It seems quite difficult to me to keep food at least 15 feet above the ground and 10 feet horizontally from a tree trunk. That's almost 5 metre!" This is absolutely not exaggerated. I've had a mother bear keep me awake all night while she and her cubs worked on getting my food down from a tree. This is exactly the reason why bear canisters were invented, and are legally required in many areas. They're basically 100% effective, whereas bear-bagging often fails. If you really don't like the extra weight of a hard-plastic canister such as a Garcia, you could buy something lighter like an Ursack. However, the Ursack is not legal in all areas. Ask the rangers before you go. The Ursack is actually supposed to be less effective against rodents than bears. It's made out of woven kevlar fibers, and the weave is rough, so small rodents' small teeth may be able to get in the gaps in the weave. 

So-called "sports drinks" such as Gatorade are miracles of modern marketing, surpassed only by bottled water. They are expensive and contain large amounts of sugar. If you're hiking long distances in high temperatures (say 40 C or 105 F), then you have a long list of hazards to worry about, one of which is getting low on electrolytes. Higher on the list would be dehydration, sunburn, and getting lost. I only do this kind of hiking once in a while, but when I do, I usually try to do as much of it as possible in predawn hours, and to protect against sunburn I bring a hat and wear a long-sleeve shirt and a pair of long pants. If you get in trouble in these conditions, it may be a good idea to find shade, rest until sunset, and then hike out in the evening when the sun and heat aren't life-threatening. In conditions like these, some people tend to get muscle cramps, which may be a symptom of electrolyte imbalance. If you're prone to this, it may be a good idea to carry a couple of the little tiny salt packets they give away at restaurants, and maybe some salty food such as crackers. 

Lightweight nylon mesh running shoes are great for hiking in dry conditions. You will be more efficient hiking in them than in heavy boots. However, if there are places where you have to slog through lots puddles, shallow streams, etc., you may have problems. You can take your shoes off and do creek crossings barefoot, or if you're concerned about hurting your feet, e.g., on broken glass, you can take off the socks and inserts, cross while wearing the shoes, and then reassemble on the other side. This works fine if you have one or two wet crossings in a day, but may be totally impractical if the conditions are more wet in general. Once your socks are wet, you're almost guaranteed to get blisters. For these reasons, a pretty versatile minimal set of shoes to own would be one pair of running shoes plus one pair of goretex boots. The boots will also work in snow. You could talk to a podiatrist or physical therapist about your ankle and knee problems, but a lot of these folks are not basing their advice on evidence-based medicine. The choice of shoes is not likely to have much effect on your knee problems. The solution to the ankle problem may just be to strengthen your ankles, or you may find that boots with ankle support help. 

I have the John Long book on climbing anchors and also a couple of others that describe the subject more briefly (Pesterfield, Traditional Lead Climbing, and Freedom of the Hills). When it comes to constructing a redundant anchor, they all seem to describe a process in which you place several nuts and/or cams and then use a cordelette to connect them together and equalize them. However, I came across this online: 

I use a loop of 6 mm cord 5.5 m (18 ft) in circumference. Buy some larger amount of 6 mm cord, because the price for the pre-cut cord is a rip-off, and you'll end up going through this stuff for Prusiks and various other uses. You will of course need a little extra length in order to tie the bend. There is no way to say what is the amount of cord needed for a 3-point anchor, because it depends on how your gear placements are situated. Mine is long enough maybe half the time. The other half of the time, I use slings to add extra length at one or more of the pieces of gear. If you're extremely confident that your gear placements are bomber, then you can get away with a somewhat wider angle between the different strands, which lets you get by with slightly less cord. If some of them are not that great, you can pamper them by lessening the angle to decrease the mechanical advantage, but that requires more cord. If the pro really sucks, then you might want to consider an equalette setup, which will give you perfect equalization. Perfect equalization is never possible with the sort of anchor shown in the photo (but it's what I normally use because it's simple to set up). 

If you want waterproofing available to put under you, I would just bring along a 2 mil thickness of plastic for use as a ground sheet. This will be much lighter and cheaper than the same square-footage of goretex. That thickness will tend to get torn on a long trip, so you may want to bring a little duct tape for use in patching it. 

Can people recommend books or online resources on self-rescue for roped climbing? As a beginning trad leader, I think I should have a basic understanding of topics like how to escape a belay and how to rappel with an injured person. I have the book by Fasulo, and I'm finding it difficult to understand. The book presents lots and lots of complicated setups and scenarios, including lots of information that seems mainly relevant to aid climbing, which I don't do (although I realize that aid-climbing techniques could become necessary for self-rescue when something goes wrong while free-climbing). I would prefer more of a "dummy's guide to self-rescue." I will probably also pay for professional instruction on this, but I don't think I'll retain much from a day of instruction unless I prepare by studying up on the topic as much as possible. 

I bring a very small pocket knife with me when I'm backpacking (or whatever they call the activity in Europe...?) As you say, it's convenient because it combines several tools in one. You don't really need three big, heavy pieces of silverware. What works for me is a spoon as my main thing to cook and eat with, plus the pocket knife for tasks like cutting slices of cheese. You don't need a fork. Do you really need a can opener and bottle opener on this type of trip? Cans and bottles would be heavy to carry. My pocket knife has a pair of scissors on it, which can be used for tasks like cutting nails, opening packaging, and cutting moleskin. A knife and scissors are also helpful for certain first-aid operations, such as cutting strips from a shirt to make bandages. Some people in some situations carry a big, huge knife. I suspect that this is often out of insecurity about their manhood, or because they're imagining some reality-TV fantasy where they tie it to a stick to make a spear for killing lions and tigers. If you have to fly to get where you're going, don't forget to put the pocket knife in your checked luggage, or you'll have it taken away from you at the security checkpoint. Small pocket knives are also easy to lose while hiking, so I tie a piece of string to mine and girth-hitch it to my belt loop when I have the knife out of my ditty bag. 

There has been a clear tendency for climbing grades to inflate over time. You can really see this, for example, if you look at the climbs at Tahquitz Rock that were originally used to define the Yosemite Decimal System. For example, The Trough was the original definition of 5.0, but Vogel and Gaines (2001) call it 5.4. Climbing gyms are a relatively new invention, and most climbing gyms are not that old. Therefore it seems natural that there would be a tendency for gym ratings to be soft, compared to outdoor ratings at long-established climbing areas, which may have been assigned at one time and then resisted inflation. The most inflated ratings I've ever seen are at the gym Sender One in Santa Ana, California, which opened a year ago. We're just talking about different types of climbing, which aren't comparable. Routes in the gym often have "jug" holds, which you almost never see outside. Outdoor trad climbs are often crack climbs, but the gyms I've been to don't even rate their cracks. Gym routes are super safe because they have many bolts, no ledges, no loose rock, and so on. The consequences of a fall in the gym are zero, whereas outdoors a fall often is a more serious thing. I'm conservative on multipitch climbs because they're committing; gyms don't have multipitch climbs. In general, I'm willing to attempt stuff in the gym that I would never try outdoors. Gyms want to stroke the egos of their customers.
