Without knowing the price, I can't say definitively, but all my instincts say to pass on this one. It's probably too big for you, objectively better frames are likely comparatively cheap, and potential component compatibility issues won't exist with newer frames. 

I don't think there's anything particularly unique to your situation to warrant specific diet recommendations. Eat carbs while on the bike, eat what your body feels like when you're off the bike. You're not self-reporting any actual issues you're having like feeling weak or tired, or having trouble achieving weight goals (e.g., gaining, losing, or maintaining) or fitness goals. So what makes you feel compelled to change something? 

If you can't feel it with a fingernail, the crack probably isn't in the carbon. Another trick is to whack the tube with a quarter over and around the crack. Do the same at a similar location that doesn't have a crack. If there are any differences in sound, the frame has probably sustained damage. For what it's worth, I bought a bike with very similar circumstances in December. I used a piece of tape to mark the beginning and end of the crack, so I can watch for any expansion. No movement so far. 

It's impossible for anyone to give firm answers to any of these questions without more detail. Get in contact your LBS. However, my gut reactions: 

There's already a cacophony of answers, but their detail obscures the simple response to your question: no, a heavier bike will not help you get fit easier than a light bike. Simply put, you will output the same amount of power independent of the weight of the bike you are riding. On a heavier bike, you will just go slower than you would have otherwise on a lighter bike. Update: The one counterexample to this is if you participate in group training rides. If you ride on a heavier bike than the rest of your group, assuming you keep up with them, you're (probably) getting a better workout than you would had you been riding on a lighter bike. However, the difference isn't as much as advancing to a more strenuous route with a faster-paced group. 

To avoid accidents in the future, the first thing you should do is properly learn to use your front brake. The front wheel will not skid under reasonable cycling conditions. Other than that, you'll over time develop a sixth sense of how safe the road conditions are. Just pay attention to the corners and watch out for dips, debris, puddles, and the camber of the turn. 

Wheel locks are an implementation of this idea. They simply prevent the rear wheel from turning, which is effectively the same thing. Again, any thief with large enough bolt cutters will be able to effectively sidestep the problem without hassle. But worse than that, the odds of your bike being stolen while being immobilized like this are still orders of magnitude higher than locking your bike to something with a U-lock. Any thief can merely pick up the bike and run off with it (which is more doable than you'd think) or toss it into the bed of a pickup and be gone. And that's simply what it comes down to. Locking the drivetrain doesn't provide any additional mechanism that a prepared thief wouldn't already be able to work around, and, while better than leaving your bike totally unlocked, is still far less safe than a U-lock. 

My cousin recently bought a recumbent bike (well, I suppose it's technically a trike) and has been having a blast with it. I'd love to encourage her new hobby and get her an accessory for it as a Christmas present. Unfortunately, I know next to nothing about recumbents and what might be useful to have. So, recumbent riders: what would you love to have or what do you find useful when you go out for a ride? Update: My problem, specifically, is that I don't know what make/model of recumbent they have. So I'm looking for accessories that will work with all (or almost all) models. Not necessarily accessories that are exclusive to recumbents in particular. 

Brooks recommends applying a layer of proofide to the bottom of the saddle. However, you should not wipe this layer off after it sets. Just leave it on, and it will protect the underside. Personally, I also recommend fenders for a bike that you plan to use frequently in the rain. This will also drastically reduce the amount of water that splashes up into the underside of your saddle. However, only a "permanent" full-size fender will really provide this protection — removable ones don't protect the seat tube, and the spray from water hitting that is the primary source of the water that gets under the saddle. 

I'm not aware of any established best practices other than "as close as possible, without any rubbing through a full revolution of the wheel". 

Pain in the ass, and waste of money. As of the last time I checked, you can't track them directly (there'd be no way for you to receive a signal from a battery-operated device 5mi away), so you need to sign up for a recurring monthly service. On top of that, they chew through battery pretty quickly, requiring a recharge every few days. Contrast that to just buying a decent set of locks. If you need to lock up your bike in the same place every day, get a thick $80 chain and a cable for the front wheel. If you need something lightweight to carry around you, a $50 u-lock is going to be a reasonable level of protection. If your bike is worth more than a few grand, you're absolutely crazy to leave it outside at all. 

If you feel a lot of friction pulling the cable out or installing the new one, you should replace the housings. This will take a little bit more time (45m) and some more money (housings: $10, bar tape: $15), but is still pretty easy to do. Unwrap your handlebars and re-insert the brake cable, replacing the old housings as you go. Wrap the handlebars back up, and you should be all set. If the nub end of the brake cable isn't being gripped by the brake lever, or the piece to do so is missing, you will have to reinstall a new brake lever. This will be a good bit more expensive, and will also require that you re-wrap the handlebar tape. Best of luck! 

Marin county, just north of the Golden Gate Bridge, has some absolutely beautiful cycling. The climb up Hawk Hill isn't too long, and offers some amazing views of the city and the bay. The Paradise loop goes through Tiburon via gorgeous windy coastal backroads and doesn't have too much climbing (the Camino Alto climb can be skipped). Mount Tam feels like an endless climb, but the views from the top are simply breathtaking — all along Ridgecrest you can see the ocean and Stinson Beach on your right, and the San Francisco bay on your left). I'll be doing the Roasters ride this Saturday or Sunday. 

9 miles should not require any changes to your diet, excluding extreme temperatures or excessively mountainous terrain. Your knee hurting is likewise not normal. Your bike may be a poor fit, or you may need to learn to use a lower gear: spinning the pedals faster, with less force required on each stroke. Neither fatigue nor knee pain should be an expected outcome of a short, low-intensity cycling trip, particularly for someone of typical university age. If either of these persist, I would strongly recommend consulting with a physician. 

I like to use an excellent power calculator to answer questions like these. Play with the numbers, and you can see the exact effects on wind resistance of different rider positions or changing the type of tire. In short, at race speeds, wind resistance requires by far the most power to overcome. It ends up being anywhere from 85%–90% of your overall power expenditure. For example, with that calculator, it takes a fully-crouched 150lb rider somewhere around 650W to maintain a 35mph pace. Remove air resistance entirely and it only requires an astonishing 50W. At the same power output (650W), with no air resistance, the same rider could reach a ridiculous speed of 475mph. Sheldon also covers the topic, providing an excellent cost–benefit breakdown for various aerodynamic improvements. And Wikipedia makes the claim that "lowering a bike's weight by 1 lb… will have the same effect over a 40 km time trial on flat ground as removing a protrusion into the air the size of a pencil". 

I wouldn't. Track frames are purpose-built for racing at a velodrome. Your tri frame will have a much lower bottom bracket. This can easily result in a pedal strike on the banked corners of the velodrome. Pedal strikes on corners with a fixed gear are bad; since the drivetrain is always turning, it will cause your rear wheel to jump perpendicular to the track surface. This will throw you into the bike on your left, and cause a spectacular crash. Not as bad is that your frame has vertical dropouts instead of horizontal ones. Horizontal dropouts are made such that any loosening of your rear skewer bolts can only cause the wheel to move further into the dropouts. With vertical dropouts, any slip can potentially result in you losing your wheel. 

Sorry to hear about your bike being stolen. Good luck finding it (check Craigslist ads and/or eBay) or replacing it! Thanks to Sheldon Brown for the image. Update: As an addendum, if you lock up your bike at the same location daily, you can use a much heavier chain lock to lock up your bike. At work, I use that lock through the rear wheel and the rear triangle, and I have a cable that I loop through the front wheel and attach to the chain. The chain lock is prohibitively heavy to carry around regularly, but if you leave the bike at the same location frequently, you can simply leave the chain lock and cable there as a permanent fixture. Update: My use of a chain and cable lock at work. 

The general consensus I've seen is that you should expect to be cold for the first twenty minutes of cycling in the winter. If you're dressed warmly enough that you're not cold for the first twenty minutes, you'll swelter. If your ride is under twenty minutes (this is just ballpark), you can simply dress warmly and remove clothes once you arrive at work. However, I suspect your ride is around twenty minutes long (given your description of a few miles). This gives you the unfortunate choice of 1) be warm initially but sweat towards the end of the ride, or 2) be cold initially but reach a comfort temperature right as you arrive at work. I'm not sure there's a good solution if your ride happens to be right around this long. You might try dressing lightly enough that you're comfortable by the time you reach work, but try to get your temperature up before leaving by sitting next to a fire or a heater vent. 

You seem like you want three different bikes all smashed up into one, and the result is not going to be good. First, the time trial frame is not intended to be a track frame. If you're going to race at the track, use a frame and components that are designed for the track. For starters, the time trial frame will have a lower bottom bracket, dramatically increasing your likelihood of a pedal strike, which can be disastrous. Second, bikes at the velodrome are not allowed to have brakes. Period. You will also likely not even be able to mount brakes on the Planet X Track frame. Third, a belt drive won't really improve the reliability of a track bike. Track bikes use significantly thicker chains due to not having to fit between tightly-packed cogs in a rear cassette. Having raced a few years at velodromes, I have yet to see anyone snap a chain. Fourth, you probably won't even be able to install a belt drive. Belts can't be disconnected/reconnected like chains can, so you will have no way to route the belt through the frame to mount it around the chainring and cog. Fifth, aero bars are explicitly disallowed from any mass-start events at the velodrome. Unless you only plan on riding pursuits, you will need standard drop handlebars. My advice? Save the creativity for your second bike. The fact that you have to ask this question tells me it's probably your first build, and you're very likely to end up with a frankenbike that's not actually what you were hoping, not race legal, and likely not even possible to build given the requirements / parts you've named. 

My cable adjusters always seem incredibly hard to turn, sometimes requiring the extra leverage of a wrench. I'm looking to replace them when I overhaul my bike and replace my current groupset. Does anyone have a particular favorite, or are they all basically the same? Since others have asked, this is a 700C road bike, and I'm looking to replace the inline adjusters, not the ones directly on the brakes and derailleurs. 

What's above the rear wheel for vertical shocks to mount to? It's pretty clear from the provided picture that the fulcrum for the rear wheel is near the bottom bracket. An upward force against the rear wheel will cause it to lift, reducing the distance between it and the mount point of the shock, allowing the shock to resist that movement. 

Drafting behind a group that's already in a paceline is one thing, but drafting behind some random commuter is a great way to get into a wreck. A random commuter isn't going to necessarily know to (or want to be compelled to) inform you when he/she is slowing or needing to make a sudden movement. And are you really getting any benefit whatsoever from drafting behind someone going 15mph? What's the point? 

TLDR; I chased down a bike thief and caught her. Turns out she's a juvenile. She claims she mistook the bike for her own. The police say if we press charges, nothing will likely come of it because it's a he-said/she-said situation. What should I do? Last night, my beloved racing bike got stolen off of the front of a Muni bus in San Francisco. I'd been watching it like a hawk, and saw it as it happened. The driver did too. He yelled, "Your bike!" and opened the door for me, I dropped my stuff and took off after the thief. She was obviously having trouble keeping her feet on the tiny Speedplay pedals, and I managed to tackle her as she slipped. Two security guards happened to be right there, and apprehended her. Thankfully, the bus driver waited for me, so I was able to retrieve my laptop bag (and 40lb bag of cat litter — man, that would have slowed me down). It turns out this happened right outside of the girl's apartment, and her mother and grandmother came out due to the commotion. The mother was genuinely and earnestly disappointed in her daughter. The police told me given her story (she mistook the bike for her own) and lack of prior arrest record, it would be hard to take it any further than a police report. The problem is that in order to convict, we would need to prove intent, and that would be difficult to do. Having done some Googling since, as I (possibly incorrectly) understand it, the city prosecutor would be responsible for pressing charges and would probably opt not to do so. Is that the case? And how should I proceed? I'm not convinced that pressing charges would result in a positive outcome (either if it wasn't successful or if it was; sometimes kids just do stupid shit and need an event like this to change their path). What would you do at this point if you were in my situation? 

Do not use a cable lock to lock your frame. Use the smallest U-lock that will work (the larger the U-lock, the more easily-defeated by a bottle jack). Use the U-lock to lock the rear wheel to a fixed object, through your rear triangle (the one formed by the seat tube, chain stay, and seat stay). See the picture below. Optionally use a second U-lock, or a cable through the first U-lock, to secure your front wheel. 

I have SRAM Force on my road bike. If I attempt to downshift, and am in my largest cog, the first click will upshift as expected. But if I press in farther, as if attempting to engage a downshift, it will cancel the upshift but resist pushing the lever further, resulting in no shift. It's the exact analogue of trying to upshift the front derailleur when already in the highest gear. If your shifters don't work like this... I'm not sure what to say. Take it to a mechanic?
