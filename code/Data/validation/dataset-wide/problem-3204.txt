I fully understand that most what is written about king Arthur is shrouded in myth, many stories having been written several centuries after his time period. Most material I found focuses on the stores themselves, or mentions the geopolitical landscape but without containing enough information to build a realistic image of a domain a 6th century king or warlord or whoever the Arthurian legends were originally based on, could have had in that area. What I'm interested in, is how much area he could probably have controlled, the number of towns, villages, castles, and a rough estimate of the population. If written material is scarce from that time period, and what we have usually doesn't focus on these kinds of information, what can we infer from what we know about typical kingdoms, lifestyle, economy, etc. of that time period? 

When was the first time in recorded history where the juridical system provided for protecting the rights of the general population, including the lower classes, so that a person of lower class could have a realistic chance to win a trial / legal battle, even against an opponent of higher social status. To make this question answerable, I'll include a list of constraints. 

Seeing as several countries in Europe are regularly rethinking whether to join or leave the European Union, I wonder how did countries join or leave the Holy Roman Empire, which was also more like a loose federation of countries. Were there instances of principalities joining or leaving the Empire peacefully? Was there ever an instance of a principality voluntarily wanting to join? Would it be possible for a member country to decide they wanted to leave, without the emperor ordering its neighbors to attack it? 

The battle between the Horatii and Curatii in ancient Rome, but it is a borderline case because of two reasons: 

Although the U.S. Civil War had multiple and complex causes, the question of slavery was a very important factor. As slavery was part of most civilizations on all continents (especially before the last couple of centuries), and in many cases the slave class had a different ethnic makeup than the privileged class, it occurred to me that I know about many slave revolts from different eras and locations, but all of them involve the slave class fighting against the privileged class. In the US Civil War the overwhelming majority of the fighters of the anti-slavery side were not members of the slave class. Was this unique in history? I never heard about an army of Ottomans or Mongols or Romans or Almohads etc. to fight for the freedom of the very ethnic groups who served them (or at least people from the same group as them) as slaves. Members of a privileged group fighting (as in risking their lives in battle, not just making speeches) for the freedom of a group they are not part of. Was this thing unique for the US civil War? If not, was it the first case? I wouldn't count a few sympathizers who join a slave revolt despite being of higher social standing. For an example to count, the anti-slavery fight has to be started and led mainly by people who are (or could be if they wanted) members of the slave-owning class. 

Gutenberg certainly had a great impact on the availability of books, but his printing press didn't help bring books into the hands of the poor. The price of books dropped from thousands of days worth of wages to hundreds, but this was still far too expensive for commoners. By the 17th century many commoners in Europe could read, but they probably had nothing more to read than the Bible which I would guess was sponsored or at least heavily subsidized to make it affordable. The poor still couldn't afford to just go to a bookstore and buy any book they fancied. Compare it with the 20th century and onward, when books can be bought with pocket change. When did books first become affordable to the poor? This means that even low income families could afford, if they wanted, to own several books without significant financial sacrifices. In the early to mid 19th century there were already popular authors in Europe who wrote for the tastes of the poorer classes, so I would guess it was around that time, but can this guess be improved upon? 

The Pentecost just made me wonder what languages were common in first century Jerusalem. The miracle of Pentecost was that the apostles were preaching in many languages, and this would assume that there were people speaking different languages in the city. I know that the languages spoken by the inhabitants were Aramaic, Greek, and maybe Hebrew, but that is certainly not many, and it would not seem extraordinary if someone knew these three languages. Can it be ascertained with at least some level of probability what other languages were spoken there? I guess one method would be to see what regions were actively trading with that province, given that Jerusalem was a major trading hub. What I could put together was the following: 

There was a peasant revolt in the Habsburg Empire in the 1830's, mainly in Galicia and Northern Hungary, caused by peasants believing a cholera outbreak was a deliberate attempt by the government and / or the nobles to eradicate the poorer social classes. Despite being almost 200 years ago, it has many similarities with modern conspiracy theories (with the exception that it turned really violent, requiring the intervention of the army to restore order). Many people believed it, even if a simple question "why would the nobles want to murder the peasant class, do they want to work on the farms by themselves?" could have blown giant holes in their theory. It also happened in several other countries. 

You have a lot more wall surface you can shoot from, and more importantly, while the enemy is scaling the bastion 2 with ladders, your own men can fire at them from bastions 1 and 3. Wherever the enemy decides to attack from, they will be under fire from multiple directions at the same time. Also, the cannons indicated on the image can fire from a very safe spot, protected from enemy artillery. The enemy can no longer destroy your cannons via firing their own cannons from the safety of their camp: in order to even be able to take a shot at your cannons, they have to move very close to the walls. Moving cannons is very slow, and they are very vulnerable in the open. 

Imagine that you are defending a fort with old-fashioned round bastions in the Middle Ages. Your walls are high, but once the enemy comes close and starts scaling the walls, very few of your defenders can engage them. 

After the invention of cannons it's even worse. Your walls have to be thicker and much shorter in height, otherwise they would be easily demolished by cannon fire. Therefore, the enemy can more easily scale them with ladders. Also, you have very few places to put your own cannons, and they would also be open to enemy fire. Now look at the star fort instead. 

Today the word "fascist" is used by many people as not much more than a swear word, due to how World War 2 unfolded. However, what precise meaning did it carry when used to describe a person in the 1930's? In a novel written and set in the 1930's, the main character is a tourist on a trip in Italy, misses a train, gets lost, and enjoys this experience so much that he intentionally avoids being found for several weeks. Two times is the word "fascist" used in the novel, once a "young fascist" asks him for a light for his cigarette, and another time a "fascist" is described to stop him at a train station, says he recognized him from the newspapers as the lost foreign tourist, and says his wife is looking for him. The main character quickly scribbles a telegraph message to tell his family he is all right, gives this message with some money to cover the telegraph fee, and the "fascist" lets him go, and fulfills the task of bringing the telegraph to the post office. What kind of person did this word describe? Was it like a job description? If so, what did they do? From the novel it seemed to be like a kind of detective or policeman, but he didn't detain or question the "lost person". If not, then what else could it mean? As fascism was the current political system in Italy at that time, what information could this word carry, would it be similar to call some random person in the Soviet Union a communist, or a random person in a democratic country a democrat (not in the USA, where it is more specific to a political party)? Otherwise what, a political activist? How would he then be recognized as such in a train station, and what kind of information or description would the author want to deliver with it? The novel itself doesn't seem to carry any kind of political message or sociological commentary. It simply focuses on the private life of a few people without any focus on the political landscape of the era. I wish to simply know what kind of person I should imagine this character as.
