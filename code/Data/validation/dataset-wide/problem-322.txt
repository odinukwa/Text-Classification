As others have said, given sufficient energy this is trivial. Simply strip the carbon out of the CO2 and they're good to go. However, there is another problem: Heat. Since they have infinite energy available I'm not going to worry about them being too cold, but how do they handle the opposite problem? I have a hard time picturing anything like 100% efficiency in this reaction. 

You assume the gods agree. Try the basic world of Dungeons and Dragons. There are multiple competing gods. It's obvious that not everything the gods say is true--there are multiple competing creation myths, for example. Or consider Harry Turtledove's The Case of the Toxic Spell Dump. We don't see much of the big picture but there are certainly multiple gods competing for worshipers--a god without worshipers dies. Note the key element in both of these examples: the gods are not all-powerful. (In fact, in the second example some severely weakened gods are slain by human action.) 

And depending upon how you define "dominant" you could also have a situation with two sentient species. Consider a world with a near-sapient predator, the world is split into two landmasses, the predator inhabiting both. (Say, like Earth) The world is subject to a lot of bad events that repeatedly push both of them to the brink. Intelligence helps them survive the calamities, both are driven to intelligence. However, survival means being mobile, they are basically limited to what they can carry--technology is basically capped at the late stone age. Although true simultaneous evolution isn't going to happen without great luck a technological cap means it's not actually required. They have also been driven to favor different environments--say, one likes swamps and the other likes mountains. Times change, the calamities end and the landmasses are linked. (Maybe a land bridge, maybe simply the removal of something that rendered an existing connection unusable--say, a very hazardous volcano on the land bridge.) Now you have two admittedly related sapient species occupying the same world. They spread into each other's part of the world, each dominates it's preferred environment but is definitely the underdog in the other's. 

Since you reject nukes this must be a modern technology or higher city. Assuming it's not too far above current technology you can cause the city to become basically uninhabitable for far less than your budget. A few saboteurs slip in, the target is their powerplant (or powerplants). Thermite charges on the transformers. Fire them all at once so they're not alerted to the threat until it's too late. They now have nowhere near enough power to operate their city. No refrigeration--they're back to the old days where meat is consumed within hours of slaughter. (Good luck distributing it that fast.) All electric cooking devices don't work although there might be some gas powered ones. The sewer is gravity fed--but soon the treatment plant becomes a threat to health. Gas might stay up for a while although the storage facilities are almost certainly vulnerable to RPG. 

The big problem here is something you can build a ship out of but not a house. Dan Smolinske suggested something that has to remain wet--a working answer but we don't have such a material. Thus, instead, I suggest combining two of the answers above. Pumice floats but it's not strong enough for shipbuilding. Rubber won't make a house because it can't stand up. Rubber bubbles were suggested but they're prone to popping. Ok, lets make the basis of our "ship" be a big raft made out of a sheet of rubber full of pumice chunks. (Line a mold with rubber sheets. Fill it with pumice chunks, pour rubber in. Since it's full they have no place to float, they stay mixed in.) Such a ship can't support a conventional mast but you could sail by means of kites. Since this is basically a raft it can't handle rough seas without waves continually breaking across the surface--it's not going to be a pleasant ride! It does have one advantage for pirate-hunting, though--it's very low profile means that if you can get in front of a pirate you spread seaweed across the ship and they aren't going to notice you until they're almost on top of you and maybe not even then. 

My vote: Home. It's just "home" is in a large wooded area in a place with huge amounts of fog. Travel only at night. Make yourself an anti-radar suit. Transform, fly up to your fortress (SEM's "home" in orbit) and leave the stealth suit there. Keep your airspeed down, your takeoff is pure vertical. By the time you're clear of the fog you'll be high enough that you won't be eyeballed from the ground and you monitor the air traffic to stay away from planes. (You need to do this anyway, you don't want a midair!) Lift vertically to the height of your station, then accelerate. Nothing will show this flight. Make your normal flights to/from your fortress very obvious--NASA-style returns and when going up make your gravity turn low--boost to orbital velocity while still high in the stratosphere. Both ways you leave a fiery trail in the sky, make it look like you can only do minimal maneuvers out of atmosphere. 

Does it need to be a book? If not, how about a totally different approach: The words really are just garbage consistent with the rantings of a madman. What matters is the structure--your diary really is a Whitespace program that generates the instructions. 

Assuming you are using pens that have replaceable cartridges: Treat some of the cartridges for fancier pens with a small dose of dimethyl mercury in dimethyl sulfoxide. This is inside the pen where it is normally not touched, but it's placed so that you're likely to touch it during cartridge replacement. While this stuff is an incredibly lethal contact poison (even able to defeat latex gloves, so dangerous it is referred to as liquid death) we want to keep the dose below that point. The objective is to mess up their minds, not kill them. Think of the damage to the organization when some of the bosses (why we targeted the fancy pens) slowly become mad as a hatter. (I'm using this quite literally--hatters used to slowly go mad from occupational mercury exposure.) 

Yes. The material strength needed goes up with the radius. Eventually you can't hold it together. You can create a modified version, though--the strength is all in an outer non-rotating shell, the station rotates within this on a maglev system. Even this will eventually reach a limit as you can't support the floors (just like there's a limit on how tall a building you can build.) 

How about half an answer? We have an example with humans. Normally we have males whose body responds normally to testosterone and they're male. We also have "males" whose body does not respond properly to testosterone, they appear female but test as XY and often exhibit failures of the reproductive system. However, testosterone actually comes in two versions. There is a very potent form released in-utero that causes boys to be boys. It's possible to have a failure to respond to this form of testosterone but still respond normally to normal testosterone. The result is an apparently female baby that turns male when puberty hits. $URL$ Unfortunately, I haven't encountered anything that says how long it takes but it never even occurred to me to wonder until this question came along. I'll leave tracking down this number as an exercise for the reader. 

Metallurgy: Their metal is weak (perhaps due to impurities they don't know about) and thus you need more of it to contain the blast of a gun. While you could make a small caliber gun there there's simply no reason to because it's too heavy for a soldier to use. 

Another reason to make such a tunnel: They are sending probes to nearby stars. The probes are boosted at extreme accelerations via a linear motor (or perhaps some technology we don't know) and a tunnel through the planet is the longest possible motor and thus the highest ejection velocity. 

While I agree with Peter Masiar that the energy density is unobtainable I don't think you need to violate the laws of physics that greatly to get a solution. Rather, lets hypothesize a device based on extreme gravity control--able to project internal fields approaching those of a black hole. The weapon consists of a tube with the generators in it and whatever support equipment is needed. When fired the weapon sucks in air from the back and uses it's gravity field to pinch the flow through an incredibly tiny and incredibly thin aperture. The result is fusion--but since it isn't instant the fusion occurs on the far side of the aperture. Some of this energy is captured to power the weapon, what isn't captured comes out as a plasma beam moving a few percent of lightspeed. You'll probably want to tone the weapon down a bit to keep the radiation from the beam from frying the operator. (This wouldn't be nearly as much of an issue if the weapon were being fired by someone in powered armor.) 

Convert the world's supply of h-bombs to cobalt bombs. Detonate. There will be no long term survivors. You're not going to be able to hide out in your shelter long enough. 

Combine three things: 1) Genetic engineering removes old age as a cause of death. Full regeneration is enabled. 2) Medical technology can deal with most everything else that isn't covered by #1. Death is basically reduced to suicide (which will be rare as the mental health and medical reasons will be gone--suicides will be those who have grown tired of life) and major trauma beyond what can be put back together in time. (Or John Varley's Ophiuchi Hotline universe--memory recording/playback. Normal procedure is to get periodic recordings of your brain, if you die the recording is played back into a clone.) 3) Once this point has been reached genetic engineering becomes anathema--perhaps due to some event such as in the Trek universe where it almost lead to a final war. Put this together and you don't have that many generations between now and then--and evolution is a combination of generations, pressure (the only major pressure now is for a desire for children) and gene pool size (very large, as we are becoming very globalized). 

How about a hybrid: Use bone tied with sinew for the structural elements, use skin for the weather seal. Look at what primitive peoples built out of animal products, other than size you should able to do something similar with human remains. At first glance you might say you can't roof the building with bone but you can--a dome. 

Not only is speed not required as per Joe Kissling's answer but speed is not able to keep it clean, either. The sword will be pushing through blood as it cuts, it's impossible for blood not to get on the sword. Thus keeping it clean means either a material that blood will not adhere to, or a speed in which the air movement will scour the blade free of blood. Consider airplane wings--even going hundreds of miles per hour is not enough to sweep ice from the wings despite a smooth surface. Ice doesn't bond all that tightly. The airline industry combats it by spraying on a coating (note that the coating also doesn't get blown off) that lasts long enough for the plane to get above the threat zone. While this doesn't give us an exact answer it shows that we need a speed far beyond what muscles can deliver. My gut says the required speed is supersonic (which means a nasty sonic boom from the sword) but I do not know. 

(Really a comment but it's too much for one) Before this question can be addressed we need to figure out what the atmosphere is like inside the world--and that implies we need to understand how gravity works. The thing is in the real world there's no gravity sticking things to the inside of the world. Everything is going to fall into the sun instead. Since obviously this isn't happening something wacky is going on. If the effect is localized to the surface you'll end up with much of the atmosphere filling the world. This means you're looking through 4,000 miles of air (much of it a lot denser than ours) to see the sun--it's going to be very red. If the effect is wide-ranging the atmosphere will fall against the shell and the sun will look like ours at noon. Note that the sky in this case will be blue-green rather than blue. You'll get the blue from scattering but you'll also be seeing the green of the other side of the world behind it. 

The wood of the shaft has subtle carving on it. The more you examine the carving the more detail you see in it--upon close inspection the carving is more intricate than one could expect to be made on wood and yet it looks pristine. Upon enough inspection you realize that the carving shows any special powers the weapon may possess. Over time you notice that the weapon does not grow dirty as you would expect. 

You think we will never develop direct neural interfaces??? For kingledion: You really think mice and keyboards would survive in a world where we have a direct mental connection to the computer? Why use the brain to command our hands to command a mechanical device to command the computer when the direct connection is better? The monkey equipped to directly command a robotic arm learned there was no need to move it's physical arm to command the robotic arm and quit doing so. Why would humans do it the hard way when the easy way is something a monkey can figure out on it's own? (The researchers set it up so the robotic arm would behave as the monkey's real arm, but the connection was in the brain, not in the arm. Even though they weren't intended to be separated the monkey figured out how to simply think at the robotic arm without moving the real one.) 

Maybe, although it will not be stable in the long term. You need to add a brown dwarf to your star system. It's glowing but in the infrared, this will still look like night. Your planet is in the L2 point of the star/brown dwarf system--thus in a permanent shadow from it. Moons of either the dwarf or of the planet itself are outside the shadow, though, and thus get sunlight. Sorry, but I don't know enough of planetary physics to see if the dwarf can cast a big enough shadow, though. Unless you're going fairly hard science that probably doesn't matter, though. Note that even if the shadow is too small it might serve your purposes--if the planet is tidally locked to the star you could have a region of perpetual night on the day side of the planet. If they didn't have a choice of where to land, or if the rest of the terrain was unsuitable (say, a waterworld, the only land being the high points around the axis pointing at the star.) 

The closer to a cube your living space is the less time and energy will be spent on transit. That is why you have skyscrapers in the cores of cities. However, tall buildings come with a cost that now in the age of electronic communications is generally not considered worth it as much less physical transit is needed. Given Trek-level tech I suspect the situation flips again. The cost of building tall will drop, the value of people's time goes up. Obviously, in the Trek-verse the lines have once again crossed and the value of being close to anyplace you want to go is greater than the cost of building tall. (Note that to get the true transit benefit of building tall you must have connections at many levels. If I have to go down a thousand stories, cross the street and go back up a thousand stories it's not going to work very well.)
