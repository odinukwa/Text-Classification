It's a warning. Situation can degenerate quickly in that kind of situation. For now, well, she's not here yet, so there is no sexual harassment. But I'd keep an eye on what's happening. I remember a female colleague of mine being in tears after a serie of machist jokes. I later tolf the "joker" his behaviour was no appropriate, but he shielded himself saying "but noooo, it's just a joke, she was not shocked!!!". I left soon after(unrelated : my consulting time there did finish), so I have no clue how it finished. If it does not reach this level, well, you are just a too sensitive well-educated gentleman. If it reaches that level, though, be sure to warn people one way or another, before it's meat for legal actions. In my case, it was not yet to that level(maybe because laws in France are not as strict as in the USA. Still, if it had became an habit, it could have finished legal). Now, the best way to warn people completely depends on the local situation. I was rather a friend with the guy, and he was alone launching the machist jokes, so I could have a 1-to-1 with him on the topic. If your situation is different, then maybe asking advice to the hierarchy is a good idea(but only if you are sure the hierarchy is not part of the bully). 

That's a legal question sp√©cific to France, so I'm not sure I shall answer. In case I can answer, the law is simple : 

Keep the other workers working and not looking at him Prevent him from surprising behaviours that may provoke dangerous delays in your operations. 

A direct, standard approach to your boss might work, but it"s far less likely. You can ask him first what kind of more business-oriented openings there are. But don't expect miracles there. Prove that you're good at managing humans by managing humans...that are not(yet) under your command. 

The trouble in question was far less personal than yours. I had words with an influent veteran who had other priorities than my hierarchy at the customer. I sticked to my orders instead of negociating, that was a tiny mistake, but still, I'm definitively blacklisted there. And next time, I'll try to be politically more "accurate". Happens. Sad, but happens. In that case, the only focus worth it is your future. Your future is another job, and if you can possibly save up a few good references in that place, it would be perfect. 

That's internal politics. It happens. Sometimes, someone has personal objectives, and you happen to be in the path. So you get shot out. It's nothing personal, just politics. Unless you want to play politics to a deep level, the only thing to do is forget the place and look elsewhere. The world is big enough for both the guy who made you kicked out(not always easy to know who exactly) and for yourself. 

You have to play political. That's a good thing, as the position you're looking for is much more political than your current one. 

would be translated more or less so(beware, I didn't do C# since ages, so you'll have probably to improve this a lot) 

You are recruiting someone, you are the one choosing your recruting strategy. If checking if your Python programmer for your accounting firm REALLY knows about teaching soccer to kids as he says is part of your recruiting strategy, it's your call. Said otherwise : what is important, in your eyes? Compliance to the job? Or being a well-balanced human-being? The answer is not obvious, and probably one of the most interesting choices when recruiting. There is another side-effect : if the candidate did not lie, it can create a bond between him & your other worker who knows about the topic. Good for the team. 

I'd like to go to another point of view : is the tone of the answer preventing you from doing your job? I mean, if at the end of the day, you did get all the information(and possible actions) you did need, the tone of the email is definitively not a big probem. You've got a real problem only if some things you need are actually not transmitted to you, and the tone of the answer goes with a withdrawal of information. In the first case, well, just swallow your ego, as long as you can work. The expected benefit(having more polite emails) is not worth the risk(worsening the relations) - any action can always backfire. In the second case, OTOH, other's answers are the way to go. Diplomatically, of course. 

Don't ask yourself if this hobby provides yourself value in general. Ask yourself is your hobby provides added value for the specific job you're aiming for. EDIT after comment : if you're looking for a broad array of jobs, but your hobby still leaves a positive impression for the whole category of jobs, then go for it. 

He didn't get your answer : they are too self-confident. Better avoid that kind of firms. He did get your answer, but decided to play with you to see your reaction : this company is not a pleasant place to work in, you will be treated bad. He did get the answer, but didn't like your style. In which case he could have asked you to use his own guidelines, to see if you can conform. 

Unless you were wrong(I cannot check), they are too arrogant to be nice to work with, whatever the reason(unless someone sees another possible reason). Too arrogant to accept a solution that is not theirs. EDIT : his change of mind at the end is really suspicious. He probably saw something in you he didn't like. And he's not going to tell you. 

Well, you did put yourself in the visor of some people, from what you say. The last thing you want(if you still intend to make career in this firm) is to give them reasons to shoot at you. Unfair? Probably, yes. That's the political part of any job. And yes, it's tough in a language that is not yours. Yet, you have to make a decision about what is the most important for you : your image inside the firm, or your bonus. For getting the latter, you'll have to sacrifice some of the former. 

Answer from someone who had to transition from COBOL to more standard languages : you have a problem. You have a problem, because most COBOL veterans are die hard, excellent programmers..... with a different mindset than the mindset needed for object-based languages. I therefore totally agree with motobatsu that despite your local superiority(i.e. you know C# better, and you also are more fluent in the underlying), you have to stay very humble. That person has other qualities, and probably proved its capacity as problem solver in other settings. The huge cultural difference IMHO is the use of objects & classes(they actually exist in COBOL, but are so cumbersome that their use is very uncommon, so I do assume he discovered those concepts transitionning to C#, and the shock has been hard). You'll probably have to introduce him to class-related concepts, one by one, and as gently as motobatsu says(i.e. "by the way, I learned this the hard way, but in C#, there is a kickass trick to do that kind of things : (your explanation)"). Other cultural differences(all of them are justified, btw) do include : 

reason 2 is the most likely, and is not a problem : you'll be at company standard. Reason one is even better : it means your profile is hot. Enjoy. 

Well, in my book, performances count over everything. I've got your level of experience(in bigger firms, though), but if comes a kid that overperforms me & help us big, I don't see any problems having him better paid than me. For the same job. I know at least one who would have deserved it. And plenty who deserved to be kicked out. Which happens often, and leads me to the second point : we experienced people might be more productive and make less errors(but often we have less new ideas, too), but that's not the reason we are better paid, in average. The reason is that people unfit for the position have disappeared(usually to other career paths, more suited to their qualities. I've seen a lady very bad in her programming job ending up as an excellent manager). So, people who are still in the job 15 years later, usually, are fit for the job. Especially if they survived several different environments. While the young wonder kid, well, noone knows yet if he's really as good as he seems. There is a much bigger risk associated with recruiting him. Hence the lower pay. Now to your case(my intro has been long, I fear). your founders are young & idealistic. You're not gonna convince them with rational arguments alone. You need to prove them you're worth more than the young kids. Only them, maybe,they'll be convinced. Or not. If it's ideologic for them, there's nothing you can do to convince them. If it's just pragmatic, well, show your worth. 

Same in France. There is a trial period, usually 3 months, sometimes 4, and which can be extended up to 7 months(that's new. 10 years ago, it could go up to 9 months). And as long as the employer can fire the employee within 48 hours, the employee can leave in 48 hours. Without anything else to pay than the days that have been done. Statistics show that employees are using this possibility far more often than employers. Yet usually want the shortest trial time possible. While employers rarely(but not never) use the tool, yet want it usually as long as possible. 7 months can seem long, but once it's over, cutting the contract is a pain. Doable, but really painful(from here comes the reputation of rigidity of the french work market, which is not totally undeserved). 

I'll say the same than Kilisi, but another way : the important thing is how you build your career. The question for you to know is : do those people have enough influence to screw your resume? If they are just unpleasant people, well, let them be unpleasant, and forget about them. And I guess they don't have that much power, as they seem not to be able to prevent you from coming back. Wherever you'll go, there will always be people who dislike you, sooner or later. Coming back to an old job is not common, but it happens, and usually, both sides know why the employee is back. I have never see it happening too bad. 

For question 2. It's a problem or not, depending on the organisation. What you need as a test scripter is proper specifications of what to test, and a good visibility of the evolutions of the software that will impact your work. So the real question is : are you correctly fed with those 2 informations? I know I am well for the first part(specs from the functional team are excellent), but not on the second one(release notes are basically impossible to use to know what script has to be maintained, in our case), and it's a problem for us. But wether the information comes from the development team, or any other source, is not relevant IMHO. For Kanban, no clue. 

There are 2 levels in your question : legal, & useful(for your job hunt, good luck btw). For the legal part, well, just remove anything you cannot say. I worked on marketing projects for banks, for targetting prospects, I can write that, but no way you'll hear me speaking about the real strategies for targetting prospects. This is covered by the professional secret. For the useful part, be sure to know who you are speaking to. I switched job for a medical oriented firm, whose customers are hospitals, not individuals. I just wrote "worked on marketing", and insisted on technical qualities instead. OTOH, had I targetted a marketing service in another bank, I would have said as much as possible "Worked on prospect targetting, helped set up new targetting methods".....etc... But staying still in the dark about methods. That's a legal requirement. Back to your question, for the framework example : as long as you don't give away trade secrets(and there is not much secret in a testing framework), you can give away as much details as you want - as long as they are of interest for your prospective employer. LCD screens are probably more protected(simple guess from me, I don't know that domain), and be more careful, but if your prospective employer is building LCDs too or similar devices, make him salivate : "implemented a dynamic menu with improved ergonomy and adaptative color"(I'm inventing on the fly, just an example), or whatever he can think is useful. If it's an accounding company, be more light: "worked with such language on LCD screen management". 

Showing your portfolio allows you to make the difference with such profiles. It's one way amongst others.
