I'm referring to an article I've read on Ars Technica about the differences in various weather models. One thing that stood out for me was a mention of 

The different schemes where to define grid-points has nothing to do with fidelity or easiness to handle. The keyword here is a 'staggered grid'. In simulations of physics that compute conservation laws it makes sense to define scalar quantities (like density, temperature) at cell centers, while directed or vectorial quantities (momentum, energy flux) are defined at cell interfaces. So depending which variable you're interested in looking at, the data for this variable can be shifted by 1/2 cell relative to the others. You have to take that into account when creating maps. 

Machine learning may sound like some magical phrase, that is able to solve every problem, but it's definetly not. I don't have the paper available right now, but what I can say in general right now is the following: What machine learning is good at, is finding patterns in any number of dimensions. If you apply machine learning to a time series (a 1-D data space) that fluctuates boringly around a mean average, as it did in pre-industrial times, then the only thing it will be able to predict is the continuation of this trend. Furthermore, taking the ANN to predict data outside of it's training range is equivalent to just taking an extremely-high order polynomial through all your datapoints and then extrapolating into the future. The former is a classical example of data manipulation, also strongly advised against in every introductory physics or statistics class. The last paragraph shall, without rigorous proof, just show that using ANN to predict trends in any kind of data, is not very smart and reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of how ANN work. 

(Sidenote: Those abundances compare well to the revised Asplund2009-abundances) We think that those numbers are representative of the bulk composition of the Sun, as it is only burning Helium since 4.567 Gyrs. Thus the composition is generally assumed to be primordial, or what the solar system started out with. Now let us imagine this atomic mixture accumulating around the young terrestrial planets and focus on the most abundant elements H, He, C, N and O. In a thick planetary envelope, shielded by UV, equilibrium chemistry will set in. Then a lot of $H_2$ will form, He will stay inert and C, N, O will try to react with Hydrogen, simply because the number of encounters is much higher with that, than inside of the CNO group. Some CO will form, as this is a very stable molecule. But as C becomes depleted, and our protosolar nebula has $C/O \approx 0.5$, there is still a lot of Oxygen left. Thus it will inevitably combine to $H_2O$. The result is, that we expect there to be really a lot of water around in Planet-forming discs. The escape or destruction of water after this period however, is apparently also very efficient, and other answers have touched upon the retention of water on Earth. So in fact Astronomers at the moment rather wonder "where did all the water go?" 

The answer is the scale. The fluid movement of a sink has a much smaller curvature radius than the grand-scale movements of a hurricane. This curvature radius plays a big role on whether your movement due to a pressure gradient will be balanced by coriolis, or centrifugal forces, as thorougly discussed here. You can read this wikipage, but the essence is the following: If you transform the equations that govern the movement of a fluid parcel into a coordinate system that moves along with the flow, you find the following force balance that counteracts the pressure gradient: $$ \frac{v^2}{R} + f v = - \frac{1}{\rho} \nabla P $$ Here we have simply two effects that arise from the translation to a rotating reference frame balancing the pressure gradient. The first one is known as the centrifugal pseudoforce, the second one is the coriolis force. If you're interested in a derivation, see here, the linearization is then straightforward. From those terms one can clearly see that fast dynamics (tornado!), or small curvature (toilet) will lead to the l.h.s dominated by the centrifugal term. However for large-scale and slow flows (hurricanes, cyclones etc.) the left side will be dominated by the coriolis term. 

Did you check $URL$ ? That's the basic definition that everybody can agree upon. A Vector $\vec \nabla= \vec e_x \; \partial_x +\vec e_y \; \partial_y +\vec e_z \; \partial_z$ made up of three derivative components and three unit vectors $\vec e$. It needs to act on a scalar quantity to make sense, so only something like the mentioned Temperature gradient $\vec \nabla T$ makes sense to write down. Meteorogists often speak only of one component, the horizontal one. This is not rigurously defined, as x and y are both horizontal components. But it usually means $\partial_h T$ which is the derivative of T along the direction h which is at the moment of interest, no matter what the rigid coordinate system says. A rate of change $\frac{\partial T}{\partial x}$ is often approximated as it's discrete counterpart of finite differences $\frac{\Delta T}{\Delta x}$ (implying smooth change of T over a distance $\Delta x$). Thus mathematically sloppy statements like 'The gradient is 2 Pa over 100 km in Northwest direction' come to life. Gradients in time are not gradients, they are rates of change. Only in General Relativity can you speak of a 4D-gradient, because time and space become the same mathematical field. 

In my experience $[m^{-3}]$ or $[cm^{-3}]$ as number density is very well understood throughout the communities of both earth, solar-system as well as exoplanetary scientists. Take for example the recently published The atmosphere of Pluto as observed by New Horizons which in fig. 3 shows the derived atmospheric composition of Pluto from occultation measurments in $[cm^{-3}]$ with some model curves: (Property of G. R. Gladstone et. al 2016 and the New Horizons Science team) The density in this unit is just a very natural and convenient outcome of the used occultation-inversion techniques. Thus of course the units are sometimes simply the result of the context in which a work is done, and as other commentators stated, a mole could be used. However I'd argue that $[cm^{-3}]$ is sufficiently simple to be understood in any context and adding moles just makes things unnecessary confusing as it suggests numbers to have a unit, which they don't. It just physically makes no sense. 

In order to calculate when and how quickly burnup happens, one needs to understand the process of burnup first. When an object from space enters an atmosphere, this happens at orbital speeds, which at the rest-frame of the atmosphere corresponds to very high mach-numbers. For the space-shuttle this was around 30 and is more or less the lowest attainable mach number coming from low earth orbit (LEO). If one takes a look at the Mach numbers that meteoroids achieve (as you correctly stated, that depends on the latitude, and day/night) i.e. the published numbers from the Swedish fireball network the Mach numbers can reach and surpass ~100. I'm mentioning the Mach number, because the shock heating that results from the supersonic atmospheric entry is a strong function of it. As soon as it gets hot inside of the shock, where the meteoroid is sitting (several thousand K) the rock is evaporating into the atmosphere. That's a process that is well understood, and the main uncertainties are the Mach numbers. Break-up can occur during atmospheric entry, as the turbulent fluctuations around the shock are very strong and can cause the meteoroid material to rupture. This is strongly depending on what the meteoroid is made of (think how an icy meteoroid will rupture much more easily than one made of pure iron) and is thus intrinsically unknown. After breakup the surface area of the fragments is much higher than before, which causes evaporation to go much quicker, and the same process as above starts over again, until the meteoroid evaporates completely or crashes into the Earth. Thus, we cannot reliably predict of a meteoroid will burn up or not. However guesstimates are possible based on the size of the object. 

Update: So I had a quick discussion with a Geophysics Prof about this. He didn't know out from his head any good source for the viscosity due to $O_2$/$H_2O$ in minerals. However he has pointed me to this article discussing a much stronger effect on Venusian plate tectonics: Surface temperatures. The paper argues that as viscosity goes like $\sim exp(E_{activation}/k_B T)$, a varying surface temperature from 750 to 1000K this can have quite an impact on the viscosity or the Peclet number (energy transport by convection over diffusion). The latter can vary in this range from <1 to >100. But as the surface temperature obviously only poses a boundary condition, we don't know for sure how far down into the mantle those differences can propagate. Coming back to Earth it's obvious that this effect would obviously be much smaller, as surface Temperature variations won't be 250K over Gyr timescales. However interesting to note. 

Other locations don't display this behaviour any more: The farther south I look, i.e. Berlin and Munich, the stronger the daily fluctuations get again, see both for comparison: 

An important issue to realize is that water must have been very abundant in the protosolar disc, as tobias already stated. To expand on that I just want briefly touch upon the atomic abundances that we measure in the corona of the sun, as presented by a wikimedia-commons graph: 

In atmospheric physics we use often a variety of vertical coordinates, $z$ the height above some reference surface, or $r$ as distance from the planetary center. However sometimes it simplifies the equations we want to solve by using other coordinates, Pressure $P$, LogPressure, Potential temperature $\theta$,... One vertical coordinate I want to specifically ask about is the shallow water height. It is defined by looking at the hydrostatic stability approximation $$ \frac{\partial P}{\partial z} = \rho_0 g$$ then integrating over a variable height $h(x,y)$ so that we arrive at constant pressure $P(h)$ we get easily $$P(z)=\rho_0 g (h-z)+P(h) $$ So $h(x,y)$ is now the variable height between two Iso-Pressure surfaces in some planetary fluid. Now we can express the navier-stokes-equation, mass equation, thermodynamic equation in terms of $h$. I guess this will be very familiar to those who could answer me. My question is now: 

Currently central and northern Europe are experiencing a very cold, false-spring like weather phenomenon. When i look at local weather charts, the daily temperature cycle seems to be completely gone, and replaced by a constant -8°C to -10°C, see below for an example of southern Sweden. 

I'm interested in knowing which type of wave a tsunami is, in a strictly mathematical sense. I'm gonna cite from Wikipedia for this: 

I would argue that the heaviest impact on plate tectonics is not only climate, but the atmosphere and oceans as whole. Oxygenation from the atmosphere and hydratation from the oceans will lead to a decrease in viscosity of minerals that are subducted with them. This can make sense if you think about it: $H_2 O$ and $O_2$ would be volatiles under lithospheric pressures and temperatures, however by subduction they are forced into the minerals' crystal lattice and can act as mobile defects. Thus, lattice chemistry plays a role in defining the macroscopic material variables as viscosity, thermal conductivity and diffusivity of the melt. If my interpretation of the possibly-existing supercontinent-cycle is correct, this would mean that a significant portion of mantle-material 'sees' the surface every ~300-500Myears and then has the potential to be altered by surface/ocean chemistry for the next subduction cycle. 

While the first property strongly hints at a tsunami being a shallow water wave, the latter fact, namely that they usually don't break would rather suggest for the tsunami being a soliton-solution of a Korteveeg-de-Vries-type equation. I thought the latter property would not be inherent to shallow water waves although Wikipedia, again seems to argue differently, however only with a picture. So maybe someone can clarify: 

There's nothing to be worried about. There's no magical Niburu or Planet X, if anything then Planet 9 might exist. There was a recent research paper that looked at the orbital elements of some trans-Neptunian objects and their curious clustering. The paper suggested that a possbile explanation for this clustering might be shepherding by a possible ninth planet in the solar system. Then the media made up big stories about magical objects in the sky that have nothing to do with Planet 9. Also I believe this question rather belongs into the astronomy section. 

A similar thing about models beating human forecasters was also mention in another article linked in this article and nowhere is there any other explanation for it, so: Do humans seriously forecast extreme weather? I get it, that meoteorologists get trained in physics, hydrodynamics etc, but I can't believe that humans try to compete with computers in crunching the numbers on differential equations. Or how else does 'human forecasting' work? 

Thanks @daniel.neuman, I have looked up some profiles to get some data: Here we see Sea temperature data as measured by the Argo project buoys on the x-axis as function of the pressure in decibars on the y-axis. Note that decibars correspond to metres as one delves into water. I took the data for a period of 1st until 10th of June 2016 (this is one full cycle of the Argo buoys), longitudinally over the whole globe, latitudinally between 60°N and 90°N. Thus this data includes streams from the arctic (as seen in the colder curves) and the mid-latitudes (the warmer curves). I have checked the other latitudes, between 60°S and 60°N, they essentially look similar to the warm curves seen in here. Between 90°S and 60°S they look similar, but suprisingly a bit warmer than on the northern hemisphere. 

($F_p$ is the pressure gradient force, $F_c$ Coriolis and $F_{ce}$ the centrifugal force. + and - denote the root's solution. Property of K. Roth, Heidelberg University.) Here in the case of cyclostrophic balance just look where the red arrow can cancel the green one and you see how Tornadoes do not care for the hemisphere, but just for low-pressure systems and can go in any direction around this. 

This 'constant temperature' seems odd enough for me to ask the question: Is the constant temperature here in southern Sweden for a few days a lucky coincidence of temperature advection sources, or is this a known phenomenon and there is some interesting physics behind this? 

Yes and no, miners die from other causes, like lack of oxygen, sulphur poisoning, etc. But for example you can already get a case of sulphur poisoning near Fumaroles in volcanic regions, simply because the air that has the sulphur dissolved in it is heavier than the surrounding air. So that's the effect you have been asking for, but you still need a severe lack of wind and the right topography to make the stratification happen. So now let's zoom out a bit. Earth has a surface. This provides friction and slows down surface winds considerably, creating the Planetary boundary layer (PBL). You can think of the PBL as 'what the free-streaming atmosphere would want to do, but then it encounters a surface'. Only because of the friction of the surface, we have only moderately strong winds on the surface that allow for special phenomena like little valleys filled with sulphur. Higher up in the atmosphere velocities are much faster. Thus, Reynolds numbers are higher, destabilization of flows comes easier and turbulence sets in, mixing everything. Only at the Karman-line around 100km height, things calm down sufficiently (in terms of frictional momentum density transfer from layer to layer) that molecules start separating by weight. So I would say your initial intuition was right, it's just less intuitive how the planetary surface plays into this. In the oceans btw. this phenomenon plays a huge role in determining global circulation. The different salinity of water layers leads to different densities and layered flows. And because the density of water is a factor of $10^6$ higher than that of air, one would need a much stronger source of momentum to mix those layers. But such a source doesn't exist, so we get layered flows of different densities.
