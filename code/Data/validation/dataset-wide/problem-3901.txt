Given a non-negative integer $m$, let $\Omega_m$ denote the set of vectors $\omega = (\omega_1, \dots, \omega_m) \in [0, 1]^m$ such that $\sum_i{\omega_i} = 1$. The set $\Omega_m$ is together with a metric $d_M$, that is the Manhattan distance between vectors, i.e., $\forall \omega, \omega' \in \Omega_m$, $d_M(\omega, \omega') = \sum_i{|\omega_i - \omega'_i|}$. Given $S \subseteq \Omega_m$, we denote $\min(d_M, S) = \min_{\omega, \omega' \in S}{d_M(\omega, \omega')}$. I am interested in the following ``most diverse $k$-subset'' problem: given two non-negative integers $m, k$, return a set $S \subset \Omega_m$ of size $k$ that maximizes $\min(d_M, S)$ (i.e., $S$ is such that $\forall S' \subset \Omega_m$ with $|S'| = k$, we have $\min(d_M, S') \leq \min(d_M, S)$). For example, if $m = 3$ and $k = 4$, it seems that the only possible resulting set is $S = \{(0, 0, 1), (0, 1, 0), (1, 0, 0), (1/3, 1/3, 1/3)\}$, with $\min(d_M, S) = 4/3$. What would be the general algorithm to compute $S$, for all non-negative integers $m, k$? 

Let $\mathbb{F}_2 = \langle a,b\rangle$ be the free group in two generators $a,b$ and let $\alpha \in \text{End}(\mathbb{F}_2)$ be given by $\alpha(a) = a^2, \alpha(b)= b^2$. Note that the index $[\mathbb{F}_2 : \alpha(\mathbb{F}_2)]$ is infinite as the family $((ab)^k)_{k \geq 1}$ yields mutually distinct left-cosets in $\mathbb{F}_2 / \alpha(\mathbb{F}_2)$. Let $D := C^*(\{ (e_{w,n})_{w \in \mathbb{F}_2,n \in \mathbb{N}} \mid e_{w,n} \text{ is a projection and } \mathcal{R} \text{ holds.}\})$, where relation $\mathcal{R}$ says that, for $m<n,v,w \in \mathbb{F}_2$, $$e_{v,m} e_{w,n} = \begin{cases} e_{vw',n} & \text{if } v^{-1}w \in \alpha^m(\mathbb{F}_2)\alpha^n(\mathbb{F}_2) = \alpha^m(\mathbb{F}_2), \\ 0 & \text{else,}\end{cases}$$ where $w'$ satisfies $vw' \in w\alpha^n(\mathbb{F}_2)$. $w'$ is uniquely determined up to right multiplication by some element from $\alpha^n(\mathbb{F}_2)$. In particular, the projections commute and $e_{v,n} = e_{w,n}$ is equivalent to $v^{-1}w \in \alpha^n(\mathbb{F}_2)$. Now $\mathbb{F}_2$ acts on $D$ simply by translation on the first index, i.e. $\tau_v(e_{w,n}) = e_{vw,n}$. $\textbf{Question :}$ Is $\mathbb{F}_2 \stackrel{\tau}{\curvearrowright}D$ amenable? The following additional information may be helpful: We can ask the equivalent question for the corresponding action $\mathbb{F}_2 \stackrel{\hat{\tau}}{\curvearrowright}\hat{D}$ on the spectrum $\hat{D}$ of $D$. Since $D$ is unital and generated by commuting projections, $\hat{D}$ is a totally disconnected, compact Hausdorff space. If we let $D_n := C^*(\{e_{w,m} \mid w \in \mathbb{F}_2, 0 \leq m \leq n \}) \subset D$, then $D = \overline{\bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} D_n} = \varinjlim D_n$, so $\hat{D} = \varprojlim \hat{D}_n$. From this one sees that a basis for the topology on $\hat{D}$ is given by cylinder sets of the form $$C_{(v_0,n_0),(v_1,n_1),\dots,(v_k,n_k)} = \{ \chi \in \hat{D} \mid \chi(e_{v_0,n_0}) = 1, \chi(e_{v_i,n_i}) = 0 \text{ for all } 1 \leq i \leq k\}$$ with $v_i \in \mathbb{F}_2$ and $n_i \in \mathbb{N}$. Let us look at the map $\iota:\mathbb{F}_2 \longrightarrow \hat{D}$ given by $$\iota(w)(e_{v,n}) = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } v^{-1}w \in \alpha^n(\mathbb{F}_2), \\ 0 & \text{else.}\end{cases}$$ Using the basis for the topology from before, it is apparent that $\iota$ has dense image. Since $\bigcap_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \alpha^n(\mathbb{F}_2) = \{1_{\mathbb{F}_2}\}$, this is actually a dense embedding (but note that $\hat{D}$ is not a group). From this, on sees that $\hat{\tau}$ is topologically free and minimal since it acts transitively on $\iota(\mathbb{F}_2)$. A short comment: This exposition can be thought of as a minimal example for dynamical systems with a free group in countably many generators and a bunch of suitable group endomorphisms. Understanding amenability of the corresponding $\tau$ for such dynamical systems would make me really happy - but my current knowledge on techniques to show amenability of actions for highly non-amenable groups is fairly limited. So any hints on what may yield insights is appreciated. Concrete picture for $D$: From the initial data, we can pass to the semidirect product $S := \mathbb{F}_2 \rtimes_\alpha \mathbb{N}$. On the Hilbert space $\ell^2(S)$, let $E_{w,n} \in \mathcal{L}(\ell^2(S))$ be the orthogonal projection onto the right ideal $$(w,n)S = \{(v,m) \mid v \in w\alpha^n(\mathbb{F}_2), m \geq n\} \subset S.$$ Then $e_{w,n} \mapsto E_{w,n}$ defines an isomorphism $D \longrightarrow C^*((E_{w,n})_{w \in \mathbb{F}_2,n \in \mathbb{N}})$. This uses the idea of independent constructible right ideals for semigroup C*-algebras developed by Xin Li in $URL$ (Def 2.5). 

Let $\mathbb{R}^n$ be a normed affine space of finite dimension $n$, and $d : \mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^n \mapsto \mathbb{R}^+$ be the distance derived from the norm under consideration. A convex polytope $P \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ is the intersection of any finite number of closed half-spaces from $\mathbb{R}^n$, such that $P \neq \emptyset$. $Pol_n$ denotes the set of all convex polytopes from $\mathbb{R}^n$. A profile $\mathcal{P}$ is a non-empty multiset $\{P_1, \dots, P_k\}$, $k > 0$, of convex polytopes from $Pol_n$. $\mathcal{Pol}_n$ denotes the set of all profiles. $d$ is extended to the mapping $d : \mathbb{R}^n \times Pol_n \mapsto \mathbb{R}^+$ defined $\forall p \in \mathbb{R}^n$, $\forall P \in Pol_n$ as $d(p, P) = \min\{d(p, p') \mid p' \in P\}$. Then, $d$ is extended to the mapping $d : \mathbb{R}^n \times \mathcal{Pol}_n \mapsto \mathbb{R}^+$, defined $\forall p \in \mathbb{R}^n$, $\forall \mathcal{P} \in \mathcal{Pol}_n$ as $d(p, \mathcal{P}) = \sum\{d(p, P) \mid P \in \mathcal{P}\}$. I would like to show that for any profile $\mathcal{P}$, the set $argmin\{d(p, \mathcal{P}) \mid p \in \mathbb{R}^n\}$ (i.e., the set $\{p \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid \forall p' \in \mathbb{R}^n, d(p, \mathcal{P}) \leq d(p', \mathcal{P})\}$) is a convex polytope (or to find a counter-example, that I failed to do so far). 

Let $G$ be a (countable) discrete abelian group and denote by $\hat{G}$ its Pontryagin dual, i.e. the compact abelian group of group homomorphisms $\chi:G \longrightarrow \mathbb{T}$. Recall that, for a subgroup $H \subset G$, the annihilator is given by $H^\perp = \{\chi \in \hat{G} \mid \chi(g) = 1~\forall g \in H\}$. If $H_1$ and $H_2$ are subgroups of $G$, then $H_1^\perp H_2^\perp$, the subgroup of $\hat{G}$ generated by $H_1^\perp$ and $H_2^\perp$, is contained in $(H_1 \cap H_2)^\perp$. $\textbf{Question 1:}$ Do we actually have $H_1^\perp H_2^\perp = (H_1 \cap H_2)^\perp$? More specifially, let $\alpha$ and $\beta$ be commuting, injective group endomorphisms of $G$. These correspond to commuting, surjective group endomorphisms $\hat{\alpha},\hat{\beta}$ of $\hat{G}$, e.g. given by $\chi \mapsto \chi \circ \alpha$. Note that we have $\alpha(G)^\perp = \ker \hat{\alpha}$. $\textbf{Question 1}$ now transforms into: $\textbf{Question 2:}$ Does $\ker\hat{\alpha}\ker\hat{\beta} = \ker\widehat{\alpha\beta}$ hold? Comments: We may assume $G$ to be countable or $\alpha(G) \cap \beta(G) = \alpha\beta(G)$ if that helps. Note that a similar statement does hold: $$\alpha(G)\beta(G) = G \Longleftrightarrow \ker\hat{\alpha} \cap \ker\hat{\beta} = \{1_\hat{G}\}$$ Here $\alpha(G)\beta(G)$ denotes the subgroup of $G$ generated by $\alpha(G)$ and $\beta(G)$. From this equivalence, one can deduce that the two questions from above have a positive answer in the case where $\alpha$ or $\beta$ has finite cokernel. 

Given a fixed positive integer $m$, let $\cal{S}$ be the subset from $\mathbb{R}^m$ defined as $\cal{S} = \{u \in \mathbb{R}^m \mid \forall i \in \{1, \dots, m\}, u(i) > 0$ and $\sum_{i=1}^m{u(i) = 1}\}$. $\cal{S}$ is together with a metric $d$ which corresponds to the Manhattan distance. Let $S$ be a given finite subset of $\cal{S}$ and $u_* \in S$. Let ${\cal S}(u_*) \subseteq {\cal S}$ be the set of all vectors from ${\cal S}$ which are closer to $u_*$ than to any other vector from $S \setminus \{u_*\}$. Given a positive integer $p$, I would like to be able to compute a finite set $S' \subseteq {\cal S}(u_*)$ of size $p$, such that $S'$ minimizes the function $\max_{v \in {\cal S}(u_*)}{\min_{w \in S'}}{d(v, w)}$. Roughly, the idea consists in drawing the "Voronoi diagram" on the space ${\cal S}$ built from the finite set of points $S$. Then, one focuses on the "cell" from this diagram associated with the point $u_* \in S$. One wants to solve the $p$-center problem on this cell, i.e., find $p$ points which are "best distributed" inside this cell. Does anybody know how to solve this problem? Like, whether it is possible to solve the problem using linear programming? Note that the inputs of the problem are $S$, $u_*$ and $p$. Edit: since the above problem may be out of reach, I'd rather consider the following simpler problem. Let ${\cal S}$ be defined as above and let $p$ be a positive integer, find a set $S' \subseteq {\cal S}$ of size $p$ which minimizes the function $\max_{v \in {\cal S}}{\min_{w \in S'}}{d(v, w)}$. Is there also anyway to encode this problem?
