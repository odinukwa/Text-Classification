Yes, it would be utterly incorrect to use vem in this case. The default pronoun to use as subject or object in a relative clause in Swedish is som.1 In all the Nordic languages, vem ‘who(m)’ is used in three ways: 

If you’ll accept non-natural languages, one such case would be J.R.R. Tolkien’s conlang Quenya. The general system of conjugation in Quenya is that the ‘verbal endings’ that show person and number are really just clitic and optionally shortened forms of the personal pronouns. They are thus not really verbal endings at all—they can also be added to other things, like prepositions. They have standalone forms (with optional lengthening of the vowel when stressed) and clitic forms (long and short); nominative/accusative is not distinguished. To give a few pronouns to work with (listing standalone, stressed standalone, long clitic, short clitic): 

Welsh is another such language, to some extent at least. Nouns and adjectives do not inflect for case; most nouns and a subset of adjectives inflect for number; the majority of adjectives do not inflect for number, though. All adjectives inflect for gender. There is no indefinite article, but there is a definite article. The definite article has three different forms, but like English /ə ~ ən/ and /ðə ~ ði/, the forms are based on phonological environment, not morphological form: 

The standalone forms act as nouns and can take cases, while the clitic forms can be suffixed to words like verbs and prepositions, but take no clitics themselves: 

This is more of a bit of musing than a proper answer, but it could be the reason that at least the first two have this seemingly irregular stress pattern. Concúpiscent and concúpiscence don't sound oddly stressed to me at all—in fact they sound perfectly acceptable and normal, despite the fact that I'm quite sure I've never heard anyone say either word. Concúpiscible, on the other hand, sounds downright bizarre. Like you, I could find no other parallel for an -Vscence/-Vscibility word having the stress on the syllable before the -sc-, so it puzzled me that I find concúpiscent/-ce so normal-sounding. I tried to figure out what pattern made -úpiscent sound perfectly normal—and it finally hit me: magnificent and its ilk! The -ficent suffix is etymologically unrelated, of course (apart from stemming from Latin participles), but it is phonetically /ˡVCɪsənt/ with antepaenultimate stress, just like what we find in concupiscent. And unlike more closely related word like reminiscent and dehiscent, there's no base verb *concupisce to show where the stress should go. So I would theorise that perhaps concupiscent/-ce, wherever the stress originally lay, may have retracted its stress due to phonetic similarity with words in -ficent. That doesn't account for concupiscible, of course, and I'll admit that I'm stumped there. Looking through a reverse dictionary I cannot find a single other word ending in -cible that has preantepaenultimate stress—it seems to be totally irregular and counter to all logic. 

I don't know about other sign languages, but I wouldn't be surprised if this kind of distinction was common among them. 

Norwegian Sign Language distinguishes between inclusive and exclusive "we". Apart from that it distinguishes between dual and plural, so there are different signs for: 

I can't see how the controversy about language-specificity of our language learning abilities can be a source of any harm or oppression. 

The articles you've linked to weren't written by linguists. I don't think "rare language" is an established term in linguistics. If it's used in a professional or academic context, it needs to be defined beforehand. For example, the National Register for Public Service Interpreters in the UK defines a "rare language" as follows: 

Note that China has fifty-something officially recognised ethnic minority groups and it's impossible to say anything about "Chinese minorities in general". Let me summarise my experiences from several months of travel in Zhejiang, Gansu, Sichuan, Yunnan and Xinjiang. I don't know how generalisable they are, but they should give you some idea about differences between groups. 

However, based on your comment, I need to conclude that the adverbial is actually inflected. It so happens that nominative and accusative often have the same form in Polish (both nominative and accusative of “two years” is dwa lata) and that confused me a bit. But this example makes it clear: 

I think the closest thing you can get in natural languages the distinction between choice-aimed and simple alternative. Finnish and Basque have already been mentioned, and here are some more: 

If we ignore the political distinction "theories of those who generally agree with Chomsky" vs "theories of those who generally disagree with him" (which is better described by "Chomskian" vs "non-Chomskian/post-Chomskian"), can "generative" be defined in any useful way? Can a non-generative theory exist at all? It is clear that speakers can produce sentences they've never heard before, so they need to generate them in some way, based on what they know. Isn't this is something that both minimalist syntacticians and, say, construction/cognitive grammarians agree on? Or does the word "generative" have any more specific meaning? 

This distinction is also present in Mandarin Chinese: choice-aimed alternatives use 還是 háishì and simple alternatives use 或者 huòzhě. Note that Polish, Belorussian, Ukrainian and Albanian are all Indo-European, just like you wanted. 

As you said, several well-documented studies say it's a phonemic distinction in some languages. It answers your question: some people can tell them apart. I don't see why you're looking for alternative explanations. I often hear from native English speakers that alveolo-palatal and retroflex consonants in my native Polish sound identical, while none of 40 mln Polish speakers have any problem in telling them apart (as long as they are not hard of hearing). On the other hand, I've been learning Mandarin for 10 years and I'm told that I pronounce tone distinctions reasonably well, but still have a problem with identifying the tone of an unknown word, even if it's pronounced clearly, but without emphasis. Again, for 1 bln Chinese speakers it is not a problem at all. 

Note that there is no use at all of vem as a simple relative pronoun ‘that/who(m)’ in that list. There are some interrogative pronouns, like var ‘where’ and vilket ‘which’, that do also function as relative pronouns, but vem is not one of them. It is worth noting that vilket, which does function as a simple relative pronoun, is not used like ‘which’ in English: its antecedent is invariably a clause or some type of more or less clearly defined notion, never a simple noun phrase. This is somewhat similar to (but still distinct from) the difference in English between restrictive and non-restrictive usages of that and wh- words (see StoneyB’s comment above). This is also why only vilket (neuter) is used relatively: the commune vilken would not make sense with reference to an abstract notion. In cases where vilket is used, the simpler relative pronouns may not be used, just like the corresponding cases in English can only take which, never that. Or to put it in different terms: cases where English can use either ‘that’ or ‘which’3 can only take som in Swedish, while cases where English ‘that’ would be ungrammatical must take vilket in Swedish: 

Using Wikipedia’s examples of the nouns bwrdd (m.) ‘table’ and bord (f.) ‘table’ with the inflecting adjective brwnt ‘dirty’: 

(Though some of those strike me as being highly unlikely to ever be used; indefinite plural possessives are rare in general, and I don't believe I've personally ever had any need to use one with the word snabel-a at all.) 

Quenya also has specifically emphatic pronouns that presumably really emphasise the subject. These are made up of the stem e- with the (non-shortened) clitic form of the pronoun suffixed; so the 1sg. form is enyë. These are also used with the endingless verb form, as can be seen in this direct quote from the song Namárië (‘Farewell’) from The Lord of the Rings, which uses the 2sg. future (-uva-) of the verb hir- ‘find’: 

When a standalone pronoun is used as the subject of a verb, however, the verb takes no personal ending of its own: the pronoun is only expressed once. Instead, a simpler, endingless form of the verb is used, which only distinguishes number (the singular and plural forms are known; the dual form is not known). The singular is the bare inflectional stem, and the plural is formed by adding -r.1 

There are not many examples of verbs with actual third-person subject endings, but there are many with explicit subjects, and these all have the endingless forms as well: [laurië] lantar lassi (‘[like gold] fall the leaves’, aorist of lanta- ‘fall’), mornië utúlië (‘darkness has come’, perfect of tul- ‘come’), etc. So even though I haven’t been able to find any sources that say this in so many words, I think it’s safe to say that the system of only adding personal pronoun clitics to the verb when there is no explicit subject holds when the subject is a noun phrase rather than a pronoun, too.   Notes: 1 This endingless form is also used when negating verbs. Generally, Quenya is loosely based on Finnish, of which Tolkien was a great fan, and this is no exception: as in Finnish, negating a verb involves conjugating a ‘negative verb’ and leaving the main verb in an impersonal form that only distinguishes number (in some tenses); for example Finnish ole-n ‘I am’ vs. e-n ole ‘I am not’ and Quenya cára-n(yë) ‘I make’ vs. ua-n(yë) cára ‘I do not make’. In Finnish, however, an explicit subject does not cause the verb to be in the endingless form, so it is minä olen, not *minä ole. 2 Final -i regularly yields -ë in Quenya, so tulë is the expected outcome of *tuli. This historical sound change is also taken piecemeal from Finnish.
