For most units, they symbol/abbreviation is placed after the number: 200 m, 75Â° F, 60 mph, 100 watts, etc. When stating values of money, such as $500, the dollar sign is placed before the number. This is also true of other currency signs like the euro, yuan, pound, etc. What is the origin of this practice for currency signs? Edit: As Anixx pointed out, the official ruble abbreviation (RUB) comes after the value. I think this is the same for all official currency abbreviations: USD, CAD, etc. But this just makes it all the more curious: why would the symbol come before the value, but the abbreviation come after the value? BTW, I consider this an etymology question more than anything, but because it applies not just to English, I wonder if it had some old origin that transcends any one language (possibly in some ancient Greek or Roman practice). This is why I asked it on History.SE. 

In the Korean War (1950 - 1953), China sent in about 1 million troops fairly quickly and actually fought the American and UN forces. In the Vietnam War (1950's - 1975), the only Chinese assistance I could find was a few thousand troops sent to do repair work on military bases. They did not fight the South Vietnamese or Americans. EDIT 2: I have since learned that the Chinese actually sent over one hundred thousand troops into Vietnam. It appears they did fight the Americans in an anti-aircraft role from the ground. Nevertheless, this does not seem anywhere near equivalent to the ground war in Korea where their goal was presumably to reunite the Korean Peninsula. Why did China support the one but not the other? They were both neighboring states of China. There are also two facts about the Korean War that I find critical: (1) The US had the atomic bomb in the 50's, but China intervened anyway. (2) Mao Zedong was in power with a "healthy" cult of personality and could have ordered just about any war he wanted, at least with a nearby country. These two facts remained the same in the Vietnam war. So why did China not assist North Vietnam in a similar scale as they did in Korea? Did they perhaps know the US could never win in such a quagmire and thus didn't have much to worry about? 

The last LoN Report on that website is for 1944, and no new South American nations were listed for Bauxite production. 

According to the history I read, they've always been under Denmark's control except in the middle of WWII. Why weren't these ever conquered by Britain? They seem close enough, almost as close as the Shetland Islands (which have been Scottish and/or British since the 1300's). Particularly after the Seven Years War (1762), when Britain's Navy was becoming hugely dominant, why weren't they taken? There was also the French Revolution, Gunboat War, and the War of the 6th Coalition, all of which saw Britain and Denmark-Norway on opposite sides. From what I read, there was a trading monopoly on the Faroes, so there was at least economic incentive. I might also ask the same thing about Iceland or Greenland for similar reasons. 

Thanks to user:pugsville for pointing out the League of Nations reports. I chose one with a 1940 column, even though some spaces were not filled in due to war. But as it turns out, all nations producing more than a million tons of oil have a 1940 number. $URL$ (Mt means millions of metric tons of crude oil produced for the whole year) 

The red part is Russia. I put a green circle around the curious part. What is that tan/beige area inside Central Asia? What SSR does it belong to? 

This is actually not too bad. If you can blockade the coasts and use the pink railway, you could surround practically the whole country. From some more data and maps on that site, especially this table, I was able to construct a map to show what railways existed in 1941: 

The Cheka was the secret police of the USSR. Wikipedia maintains a list of the Cheka and its subsequent renamings: 

There are more, but I didn't bother including nations that produced less than a million metric tons of crude oil in one year (except Egypt because it was pretty close). Interestingly, Saudi Arabia is not on the list! Apparently they had not yet found oil there. Iran and Iraq are on the list, though. 

At the 11th Party Congress, Stalin was voted into the position of General Secretary. This was the first time the party had a General Secretary. This was in 1922 Mar/Apr. Why was Stalin chosen? I noticed that Lenin nominated him, but why? Why not Lenin himself? Why Stalin instead of someone else like Lenin, Trotsky, Zinoviev, etc? (Note: I included both tags, USSR and Russia, because technically the USSR had not been created yet but the relavence is obvious.) 

During revolutions or civil wars, countries usually suffer enormous economic losses along with much civil unrest. These things would seem to make it impossible for a nation to operate a huge army and go on major wars of conquest. But France did that in the Napoleonic Wars, and conquered almost all the other European Empires. How? Did France somehow not suffer economically? Did France somehow recover very quickly in time for the Coalition Wars? 

The Russian Revolution is fairly famous for moving the capital from Petrograd (St. Petersburg) to Moscow. But I was surprised to learn that the capital of Ukraine was Kharkiv until it was switched to Kiev in 1934. Why was this done? The only sliver of explanation I've found was on wikipedia's History of Kiev page, where it says: 

Both of those articles have citations. So now I'm left wondering exactly when the oil embargo happened. Jly 26? Aug 01? Some other date? And did the Netherlands really join late? That really piques my curiosity. Why would the Netherlands government join such an embargo late? Surely they were informed and requested to join it in the first place. Otherwise the oil embargo from America wouldn't have accomplished much. Indonesia had more than enough oil for Japan's needs (indeed, that's why they invaded). 

So to sum up: Invading Turkey could only be realistically considered if Germany could somehow do it "one at a time" like they did with Czechoslovakia and Poland. Even then it would have cost a lot of casualities and time. By 1940, the gig was up and Britain was at war with Germany. The bigger threat was Russia, and Hitler actually believed Russia would die by the end of 1941, giving him access to oil in the transcaucasus. No need to go after non-threats unless somehow you knew they were about to side with the allies. Turkey was pretty committed to neutrality, and German intelligence probably knew this. 

In reading about the historical Opium situation in China, the silver trade is mentioned again and again. I get the impression that China only accepted silver, even though I have never seen gold mentioned at all. I am not a scholar, but to my knowledge gold has never been rejected as an exchange medium between large states conducting massive trade with each other, especially if they already accept silver. At least, until I read about this. China seems to be a curious counter-example. I read Wiki's article on Opium History in China, which led me to read about the Canton System. That article says: 

I found a youtube lecture by Stephen Kotkin. He is a professor of history, wrote 2 books on Stalin with a 3rd on the way, and has access to certain Russian archives. That's all I know about him, credential-wise. At 33 minutes in, he says basically the following: The Germans crossed the line (the agreed-to line dividing Poland between Germany and USSR in the Molotov-Ribbentropt Pact) and were holding territory allocated to the Soviets, the Soviet and Germans talked about this, then Stalin decided to retake the territory by force, and did so. (Later he says the territory was the Galician Oil Fields.) Is this true? Did the Red Army and German Army really clash in Poland at this time, with casualties on both sides? If so, what is the battle called and where can I read more about it? I couldn't find it on wikipedia or even google. 

The Battle of Britain went on between July and October of 1940. During this time, how prepared was the German Eastern Front? Specifically, how much of the German Army was on the West (either occupying France or waiting to invade Britain), versus how much guarding the East? How much of the Luftwaffe was busy with Britain, versus how much was guarding the East? Was the East Front fortified at all with trenches? Or perhaps, was the east guard given mostly to the Italians? BTW, at this time the Axis did not include Hungary, Romania, Yugoslavia, or Bulgaria. So the Eastern Front is relatively small at this point, running through Poland, and along Austria and Italy. Edit: Another way of going about this is, how much of the Wermacht was occupying West Poland and Czechoslovakia at this time? 

The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact included a secret agreement to divide Europe between Germany and USSR. I'm wondering if this secret agreement included timetables for those takeovers, or if they were allowed at any time they wanted. Hitler invaded West Poland 1939 Sep 01. Stalin invaded East Poland 1939 Sep 17, then Finland 1939 Nov 30, then Lithuania 1940 Jun 15 followed by the remaining Baltics. Was this timetable agreed upon? Was the general order of invasion agreed upon? Or was it just left up to whenever they wanted? 

I'm looking for a source that lists all crude oil production by each nation, as it was in 1940. The reason is to understand geopolitics of the time, especially the oil security (or lack thereof) of each nation participating in WW2. So far I've only found the US at 4 million barrels per day according to this graph. 

It has a lot of photos and talks about the Rail Plough used to destroy railroads as they retreated. However, I question the use of steel sleepers. Steel was surely much more expensive and rare than wood. And there must be 1,000 or more sleepers per km of track, and Germany penetrated almost 1,000 km into the Soviet Union during Barbarossa. Would Germany really be spending that much steel, when they could just use wood? 

I just read the very short wiki article on the Satere-Mawe people from South America. They have an initiation rite where a bunch of Bullet Ants sting someone for 10 minutes, and not only that, but to repeat this a total of 20 times over the years. I would like to know when that practice started. Can it be dated through oral history? Were there perhaps other tribes in the past that did the same thing? At the very least, I'm hoping for the earliest mention of it in a written account. I tried to google this but mostly got pop culture websites with no history. Maybe someone knows a search technique that can find this. Edit: I got a tumbleweed badge for this question. I'll take it as a good sign to open a bounty.
