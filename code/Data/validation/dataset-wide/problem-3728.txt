I suspect that that these two notions of compactification differ, because it seems strange that $O(\Gamma)/\Gamma$ would always be homeomorphic to $\mathbb{S}^n$. 

I find the standard notation $X \times_G Y := \frac{X \times Y}{G}$ for balanced products of $G$-spaces annoying, because it conflicts with the well-established notation for fibre products. But on the other hand writing out the full quotient $(X \times Y)/G$ is cumbersome, especially if you're dealing with associated bundles to principal bundles, or if you have spaces with compatible left and right actions of different groups, and you need to write something like $X \times_G Y \times_H Z$. So I came up with that following notation which combines the product symbol "$\times$" and the quotient symbol "$\_$" into a single binary symbol: 

Monoidal category theory (especially dagger-compact categories) and its associated string diagram calculi are a very useful language, especially for quantum mechanics, quantum computing, and QFT. See this nice article by John Baez & Mike Stay for some of the details. It seems that quite a good deal of basic principles in quantum mechanics, such as the no-cloning theorem are really just statements about monoidal categories. And Feynman diagrams are essentially string diagrams for monoidal categories of representations. Topos-theoretic QFT is a thing as well, though I honestly don't know anything about this approach. 

My thoughts: Since a non-holonomic jet depends on the infinitesimal path taken, and a holonomic jet does not (depending only on the endpoint of the infinitesimal path) a semi-holonomic jet should admit an interpretation somewhere in between these two. The path dependence for semi-holonomic jets should be less strict in some sense. 

I was just watching Andrej Bauer's lecture Five Stages of Accepting Constructive Mathematics, and he mentioned that in the constructive setting we cannot guarantee that every ideal is contained in a maximal ideal---since that obviously requires Zorn's Lemma (or is equivalent to Zorn's Lemma, perhaps?)---so we need to approach algebraic geometry from a different point of view, such as locales. I am curious how algebraic geometry looks from this constructive point of view, and if there are any good references on this subject? I'm fairly new to constructive mathematics, though I have been lured in by Kock's synthetic differential geometry, and I'm starting to read the HoTT book. 

Section 4.1 of this paper by Dusko Pavlovic and Bertfried Fauser has a brief description of what I believe you're looking for, in the general situation of manifolds modelled on normed vector spaces. Section II.3 of Sheaves in Geometry and Logic by Moerdijk and MacLane discusses it in more detail for the usual case of finite-dimensional manifolds. 

The last one, without the group decorating it, is used in the same way as tensor products $\otimes$ when the ring involved is obvious (e.g. if you're working with associated bundles to a $G$-principal bundle $P$, and you're not planning on taking any reductions of the structure group). It's just a rotated semidirect product, so it's easy to implement in LaTeX, and looks similar enough to the usual notation that it's easy to introduce in a talk. Here's my LaTeX code: 

I apologize in advance if this is pretty straightforward; I'm a differential geometer and physicist by training so my homological algebra and homotopy theory are a bit weak. 

If I recall correctly, quotients of smooth manifolds with boundary do not necessarily have a unique smooth structure. If am I wrong and they indeed do, could someone point me to a reference? In Bridson & Haefliger's text, they describe a different notion of compactification by attaching a visual boundary $\partial M$ to $M$. Given a complete connected Riemannian $n$-manifold of non-positive sectional curvature, take a point $x \in M$ and define $\partial M$ to be the set of geodesics defined by vectors in the unit sphere in $T_x M$. When $\overline{M}= M \cup \partial M$ is given the so-called cone topology, the topology restricts to the usual one on $M$, and they state in Example II.8.11 that the topology of $\partial M$ is that of $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$. 

The sheaf-theoretic terms "soft", "flabby", and "fine" are of an obviously geometric character, and suggest opposition with "hard", "rigid", and "coarse" sheaves (I'm just inventing these terms here). My rough "intuition by opposition" for soft sheaves is that the sheaf of smooth functions on a manifold is soft since every germ can be extended to a global smooth function, whereas the sheaf of holomorphic functions on a complex manifold obviously fails to be soft, and is thus "hard" in some sense. But I still don't really see what mental imagery the term "soft" is supposed to evoke. Since these terms most likely originated in algebraic geometry, I am curious what sort of geometric ideas they are supposed to capture? I personally work in the $C^\infty$-differentiable side of geometry, so my mental library consists largely of locally constant or soft sheaves, and I'm less familiar with the algebro-geometric content that likely inspired these terms. 

Suppose we are given an open cover $\mathcal{U}=(U_{i})_{i \in I}$ of a smooth manifold $M$, a cocycle of smooth transition functions $g_{ij}: U_{ij} \to G$ where $G$ is a Lie group, and a (not necessarily faithful) action $\lambda: G \times S \to S$ on a smooth manifold $S$. Then this is the data of a fibre bundle $E \to M$ with typical fibre $S$ and with structure group $G$ over $M$. From this cocycle point of view, how can we describe the jet bundle $J^r E \to M$? 

I'm curious how much of homological algebra carries over to a constructive setting, like say HoTT (or some other variety of intensional type theory) without AC or excluded middle. There doesn't seem to be a lot of literature on this topic (or at least it's difficult for an outsider like me to find). The category of abelian groups is fortunately still abelian in HoTT since we have set-quotients, so epis and monos are all normal. So I assume that a good amount of the general theory of homological algebra in abelian categories still applies (such as the snake lemma, 5 lemma, etc.) But unfortunately it seems like the classical approach to derived functors suffers a setback because we cannot guarantee that we have enough projectives. I'm not sure if the existence of enough injectives is in jeopardy though, since abelian sheaves have enough injectives, but the comments in this related question suggest that indeed the existence of enough injectives is questionable. I would guess that the derived category and Kan extension definition of derived functors (as given in Emily Riehl's homotopy theory textbook, for example) is better behaved in constructive mathematics, and it looks like Mike Shulman advocated this approach here. But from my naive point of view there's still the issue of showing existence of the Kan extension via functorial deformations of homotopical categories, and I'm also not sure if the usual localization procedure for constructing the derived category is complicated by the lack of AC. Or perhaps something like $\infty$-topos theory in the style of Lurie, Riehl, Verity etc. (of which I know almost nothing) is the best approach to constructive homological algebra in HoTT, since the logic natively supports higher groupoids. Has any work been done on this since the advent of HoTT? I'm pretty new to constructive mathematics (still making my way piece-wise through the HoTT volume), and I just have a "working mathematician's" knowledge of homological algebra, but I'm excited about the future of the univalent foundations project.
