Definitely. This was happening throughout most of Earth's history, it's happening now, and it will happen in the future. Subduction occurring in subduction zones are the main mechanism (only mechanism?) of taking stuff from the surface and pushing it down deep into the mantle. Oceanic crust gets hydrated by reacting with the ocean water. Primary magmatic minerals such as pyroxene and olivine are altered into a variety of hydrous minerals: serpentine, amphibole, epidote, chlorite, talc, etc. Once this hydrated crust gets subducted most of the water is volatilised and gets lost to overlying mantle, and even flux-melting it so you end up having volcanoes. Here's a picture: 

What advanced method? Stop burning fossil fuels. Run vehicles on electricity. Produce electricity using solar/wind/nuclear methods. Develop new methods. Sell methods to other countries. Profit! 

Obsidian is volcanic glass of felsic composition (i.e. SiO2-rich) whereas basalt is a volcanic rock which may or may not be (partially) glassy of mafic composition (i.e. SiO2-poor). So when you're saying 

Since you are not asking about the mechanics I will spare you from explanation about mantle convection and similar processes. 

Salar de Uyuni in Bolivia holds a large percentage of the world's lithium reserves. Since the lithium is dissolved as LiCl in the brine, it makes extraction much easier than the alternative: Li bearing minerals in granitic pegmatites. What is the source of lithium in the brine? Where does it come from? 

A common misconeption is that rocks on Earth are any different from rocks on Mars or the Moon. That's actually false - these planetary bodies are made, to a first approximation, from the same stuff Earth is made of. Basalt (and I'm being extremely sensu lato on this). There's nothing magical or mystical or alien about basalt. And you know what - because Earth is such a complex planet with tectonics and surface processes and everything there are much more interesting stuff on Earth then elsewhere (in my humble opinion). 

In, principle, yes. Think of a granitic porphyry rock with huge feldspars and tiny zircon, apatite and oxides (magnetite, ilmenite, etc) in the groundmass. It could very well be that the feldspars are huge because the rock was rich in Na, Ca, K, Al and Si and it had little Zr, P, Ti and Fe3+, as you would expect from a granite. Even if all minerals were crystallising together, the minerals with the trace components will not grow any larger because there is simply not enough of the elements that make them. Visual bias Even if the rock looks porphyrytic, it may not be. Rocks with equally distributed grain size (also called seriate) may sometimes appear to be composed of phenocrysts and groundmass because this is what our brain sees. A seriate rock will have large and small crystals, and usually you will have lots of small crystals sitting just next to the big ones. Our brain tends to ignore the fact that the big ones actually come in all sizes, medium and larger. Growth rate It was mentioned in the comments that "Crystal size is essentially a function of how long the crystal has been growing". This is mostly true for a specific crystal, in a known cooling rate, in a defined chemical magma composition, when it perfectly obeys thermodynamic rules, etc. In real natural systems this is not always the case. For crystals to grow, elements have to be removed from the silicate melt structure and attached to an existing crystal. What if there is no crystal yet? Usually, the formation of crystal nuclei requires a certain amount of undercooling of the silicate melt (up to a few tens of degrees, depending on conditions). Crystals can also nucleate on other minerals or vapour bubbles in the magma (just like bubbles in beer nucleate on the glass and not somewhere in the beer itself). source: $URL$ However, temperature ideal for nucleation is not always ideal for crystal growth. So in this case, you will end up having lots of small crystals. This varies for different minerals, so one mineral may be in the "growth" field while another will be in the "nucleation" field. This will cause two different mineral sizes as the same time. Dynamic magma chambers Recent research shows that our view of a single magma chamber that crystallises slowly or erupts is basically wrong. There are abundant processes that mix and mingle magmas, inject magmas to other magmas, and this sort of stuff. Think of a shallow magma chamber under a volcano that has crystallising clinopyroxene and has some amount of volatiles (CO2, H2O) dissolved in it. This magma is sitting there minding its own business, when suddenly a fresh hot mafic magma is injected from below. Our pyroxene phenocryst-bearing magma is now heated, expands and tries to escape upwards. It decompresses while doing so, nucleating bubbles of gas. The magma is also very undercooled and undersaturated with respect to olivine, so this olivine now crystallises in abundant tiny crystals on the bubbles. In this case, the groundmass actually crystallises when the magma is heated, not when the magma is cooled. Note that this is only an example, not all rocks that look like this formed in the way I described, but it's a possibility. This is also true for plutonic rocks where the mineral assemblage you see rarely corresponds to the exact composition of the magma from which it crystallised. Crystals can and do move around in magma chambers. This can bring together crystals of different sizes into one place. Large crystals may not necessarily crystallise from magma Phenocrysts may nucleate and grow rapidly in water bubbles that exist in the magma, during magmatic conditions (so I'm not talking about zeolites). While the minerals are those you would expect to see in the solid rock after magma solidified, it was favourable for those crystals to grow in the coexisting bubble. This is one explanation (out of many) for the formation of Rapakivi granites.

It's pretty hard to say anything about this kind of weathering without actually being there and having a closer look. Usually, the simplest explanation for reddish or brownish colours in otherwise grey rocks is the presence of iron oxides. You can see that the brown area is on a fault or joint face. This leads me to think that maybe this was a conduit for groundwater that oxidised the rock. When the road cut (or whatever it is) was made, this part was exposed. Notice that you have some brown elsewhere - it could be that those are faults or joints cut perpendicular to the face, so that's why you only see a brown streak instead of a surface. 

You did not mention why you are interested in brannerite, so I am assuming you want it as a collector's specimen and not a microscopic crystal. Unfortunately, there is no definite source. However, there are some possibilities: 

Leaving aside the discussion of whether such a thing caused the formation of the Siberian Traps and thus the P-T mass extinction, in theory, can an impact on one side of the Earth cause volcanism on its antipode? Also very important, why would this happen? What's the supposed mechanism that converts short term seismic activity to volcanic activity derived from long term hot spots? Note that I'm not asking about in situ volcanic activity (such as the case of Sudbury). The impact also has to be reasonable in magnitude: I don't consider the moon-forming event that destroyed the young Earth as a reasonable impact in magnitude. 

Was there any experimental study that determined $D$ for apatite and silicate liquid? The GERM Kd database only lists one study with carbonatite liquid, but that's not what I'm looking for. 

Another reason that we see many impacts on the moon and not on the Earth is their age. A very large portion of the craters on the moon formed during the Late Heavy Bombardment, and event that happened around 3.9 billion years ago in which many inner solar system bodies were struck by a large number of impacts. Once an impact hits the moon, the crater is there. But there are hardly any rocks on Earth that remain from that period, giving the impression that Earth was spared from it. It didn't - we just don't have any remaining (geomorphological) evidence that it happened. 

Rocks are not necessarily made out of minerals. Yes, most of them are but it's not a requirement. Also, not every collection of minerals is a rock. For instance, sand is not a rock. This is not limited to rocks of biogenic origin. Take for example obsidian, or volcanic glass. In some cases there is not a single mineral in the rock, yet it is a rock. My own personal opinion about definitions (especially in geology) is that occasionally they're useless. What happens if you have a borderline case that falls out of the strict definition? Remember - names and definitions are an artificial thing that we, humans, invented. Nature doesn't always play by our rules. 

Yes, forest fires happened 120000 years ago. Also a million years ago. Also 100 million years ago. And now. But now, forest fires are started by people throwing away cigarettes and not putting out their campfires properly. Does that mean that all modern forest fires are because of natural causes? No. I hope this analogy helps you understand the logical fallacy in what you wrote. Now, to your question: 

Molecular water can react with rocks and minerals to form hydrous minerals and get trapped as structural water (similar to adding water to Portland cement in the making of concrete), and hydrous minerals can be heated enough to release this water (usually requiring hundreds of degrees). Let's look at some examples of how this thing might work. Oceans have mid ocean ridges, where the oceanic lithosphere is being formed. This area has very shallow magma chambers so the rock is extremely hot. Water that percolates down through cracks gets heated to a large degree, lowering the density and increasing the buoyancy of the water. This water then goes back up through hydrothermal vents on the seafloor. Here's a spectacular video of some of those things: $URL$ When the water goes down, not all of it goes back up. It also reacts with the rock, forming hydrous minerals. For example, anorthite (CaAl2Si2O8), a common mineral in basalts, is hydrated to epidote-clinozoisite: Ca2Al3Si3O12(OH). In some occasions, oceanic crust can be uplifted and is then exposed. One example is Cyprus, where you can see features like this: 

Vredefort No extraterrestrial iridium anomaly: $URL$ I'm not sure I fully agree with them, because there is quite a lot of Ir there and their threshold of 200 pg/g seems somewhat arbitrary to me. They claim the Ir was derived from local rocks, but that's a hell lot of iridium! Sudbury There is an an iridium anomaly. Read all about it here (paywalled) and here (open access). 

I'll add a bit about the name: In Biblical Hebrew (and to a large degree in modern Hebrew), the word for sea is "yam" (ים), which doesn't have the modern meaning of a roughly defined area that is part of the larger ocean system. Instead, it basically means "a large body of water". There four "seas" in this region. "Yam Hamelah/Hamavet" ("sea of the salt/dead" ים המלח/מוות), "Yam Kinneret" (sea of galilee ים כינרת), "Yam Soof/Hayam Ha'adom" (sea of reed/the Red Sea ים סוף/הים האגום) and just "Yama" ("to the sea" ימה), literally means "west", referring to the Mediterranean Sea. The word for lake, "agam" (אגם), was used only for small seasonal ponds. The biblical usage for the "seas" remained in modern Hebrew, but whenever we refer to any other inland bodies of water elsewhere in the world, we actually use "agam" and not "yam". So in summary, it's called a sea because of historical and linguistic reasons, not because of any geographical or morphological features.
