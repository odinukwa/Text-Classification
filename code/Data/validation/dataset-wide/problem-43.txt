Supplementary answer, about passively cooled computers in atmosphere. Building completely silent (fan-less) computers has been a hobby of mine for quite some years. It's getting a lot easier these days. Some years back you needed enormous heavy cases with heat-pipe assemblies that attached to the CPU, to transfer heat to the (huge, finned) aluminium case from where it was shed to the atmosphere by convection. And if you got your calculations wrong, the CPU emitted smoke and died. Today, you can get the power of a modest laptop PC by consuming just ten watts, and the convection cooling requirement has reduced to a finned heatsink about 8cm cubed. (That's with the baroque intel architecture. The ARM chip in your phone does much better still, and is always passively cooled). Convection cooling involves a high power law of the difference in temperature between the heatsink and the surrounding air. When you are used to passive-cooled systems, you get to know that they will run distinctly warm, even hot to the touch. The CPU is quite happy - commercial ones are rated up to 80 or 90C, and mil-spec is probably well above boiling point (with a degraded clock speed). Also when you test one, you need to leave it running under load for several tens of minutes, monitoring the temperature. It takes that long for the temperature to stabilize with heat input = convected output. In the days of Athlons, it was a bit nerve-wracking, these CPUs could self-destruct if they got too hot. Today's CPUs just throttle their clock speed down if they are getting too hot, and are pretty much proof against damage. They just quit if they get too hot. OK, in vacuum there's no air, so the system is going to overheat sooner or later, unless it was designed with some vacuum-proof heat transfer plant to carry its heat to massive radiator fins on the outside of the spacecraft. But perhaps, the question is how to make it "later" rather than "sooner"? From my experience, the answer to that is good thermal conductive coupling from the computer to more massive chunks of metalwork. It won't overheat until it has heated all the metalwork up to a "too hot to touch" temperature (60-70C). Which could easily be hours: long enough to rescue the situation, or realize that it's nor survivable. One fairly low-tech way to increase thermal inertia and coupling is to put the computer in a sealed box filled with oil (low tech, flammable, higher vapour pressure) or liquid silicone "oil" (not flammable, very low vapour pressure). You could do this to a spacecraft system, but there's an obvious weight penalty. Note, this is also a solution to cooling all the other chips on the board, which normally relies on air-convection. Here on the ground, it's a way to build a completely outdoors-proof or even underwater-proof computer: the oil keeps water and water vapour out. 

A lot depends on the nature of the magic. A common trope is that magic is unpredictable, dangerous, hard to constrain once unleashed, almost wilful in its own right. The more powerful the spell, the more risk of it backfiring. Especially so if it is autonomous, working in the absence of the mage who cast it. In this case a mage will probably not use high-grade magic to protect anything unless it is of enormous value. A thief (risk-taker) will know that the chance of being magically struck dead when he thieves something of lesser value is small. Something bizarrely unpleasant but short term is more likely. A wise mage may well use layered defences around anything priceless. A warning to the mere thief on the outside and a lethal trap for a powerful rival mage on the inside. A thief will learn what he can of precautions against lesser magics which can be taken by a non-mage. And he will probably have access to some magic even if he has no ability to cast it himself. There will almost certainly be lesser mages who are not averse to "fencing" stolen property of a magical nature, and providing low-grade wards or healing to the thieves. There may also be mages in whatever form of police or civil authority exists. "It takes a thief to catch a thief" and a mage to catch a mage? 

There is an upper limit to aircraft size dictated by wing stiffness and the limits imposed by real world materials. A longer wing will bend up more at the ends and be more able to twist. The Airbus 380 and large military transports are close to economic limits. Physical limits do not let you make monoplane wings a lot longer. If you want an extreme design it is probably a biplane with much cross-bracing to stiffen the huge pair of wings. A box is a lot stiffer than a sheet. It would be slow and waste a lot of fuel because of the drag but it might fly. Your problem is why it would ever have been developed and built! Edit. Another possibility would be a very high drag smaller wing with air being actively pumped over it. A nuclear power plant might let that be feasible. Even harder to imagine it ever being built! 

You can't get liquid water oceans on the surface of a Venus of any composition, and we believe we can infer that life requires liquid water on a planetary surface. Venus is too deep inside of the Sun's "goldilocks zone". Water vapour is quite a powerful greenhouse gas. On Earth, increasing water vapour in the atmosphere is more than counteracted by increased cloud cover, which reflects enough sunlight to stop the surface temperature rising. Further in, the cloud cover would reach 100%, enough sunlight would still be getting absorbed for the surface temperature to reach 100C, and it's all over for life. Thermal runaway - the oceans boil. This will be the ultimate fate of the Earth as the Sun gets hotter, well before the Sun actually goes nova. An Earth-sized planet in Mars's orbit might well be habitable. It's Mars's low gravity and solidified core that doomed it. (Possibly also not having a large moon to stabilize its axis of rotation, which Venus also lacks). 

Threaten to violate causality. Some have speculated that there is a need for a "cosmic censorship principle" to prevent the creation of closed time like curves and causal paradoxes. So start to build a time machine in or near your enemy's solar system and expect that system's star to "inexplicably" go nova. That big ball of plasma will very effectively mask any small local paradox that happened a few minutes earlier. Beware. Do not ignore the minority opinion that there is a cosmic morality principle as well. If so it is your solar system that may be destroyed as soon as your evil plan is placed in irrevocable motion. Warning: this plot has been used. I read the story many years ago. Can't remember author or title. 

It's unlikely but not impossible. Parasites tend to lose abilities that they once had, as they evolve. For example, many plants which parasitize other plants have lost their ability to photosynthesize, and/or the ability to grow leaves. This may be because what would have been a deleterious mutation in a non -parasite becomes harmless when it is the host that suffers any consequences. So I'd rather expect a plant that could parasitize animals would similarly later lose the ability to photosynthesize. BTW I once read that there are plants that prey on animals much bigger than themselves. Cacti with strong barbed spines and loosely attached "daughters". The daughters snag a passing animal. All attempts by that animal to free itself simply drive the spines deeper. The wound becomes infected. The animal dies. The baby cactus roots itself in ground well moistened and fertilised by the rotting corpse. Not strictly speaking a parasite, but very yukky. Roll forwards many million years and it may have evolved to feed off the animal without killing it. Roots that colonise the wound and secrete antibiotics to prevent bacterial infection, maybe? 

Quantum computation. There are some problens where creating a set of entangled entities ( qubits, quantum bits) and performing operations on them will obtain answers very much faster than by conventional computation. For example 5000 entangled qubits coul d obtain the prime factors of any number up to 5000 bits with just two factors. Bye bye most of today's cryptography! State of the art is something like five qubits. Yea, we can factorize fifteen with a quantum computer. Whether computing with big numbers of entangled bits is possible is either an open question or an ultra top secret. Also untappable communications. Quantum key distribution is a real-world technology already being used. Tens of bits per second isn't great but you can be absolutely certain that nobody is eavesdropping on your low bandwidth quantum channel. NB this has nothing at all to do with the SFnal FTL communicator which is almost certainly impossible. 

The limit is dictated by economics rather than technology. If you assume that everyone in the building wants to arrive and leave at ground level at least once per day, you get to a point where adding sufficient lift (elevator) capacity to support an extra storey has negative economic benefit because of the nonproductive area it consumes on lower storeys. One way around that is a vertical city where the denizens of the upper levels do not leave on a daily basis. Instead, there are shops, parks, services, all provided on those levels by people living there. There's still an economic limit, since all the things that they consume still have to be transported up from ground level, but I've read that a mile-high vertical city is not impossible and does not require exotic materials. By the way, a tall skycraper (with mass dampers) is less vulnerable to earthquakes than a much shorter one or a regular house.
