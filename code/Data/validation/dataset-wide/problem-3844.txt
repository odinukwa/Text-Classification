I am wondering if there are any rigorous results telling that some dynamical system hits infinitely many primes (except for the case when orbits are just arithmetic progressions). To make it specific, is there a polynomial $f(x)$ such that its iterations $f^n(x)$ are prime for infinitely many $n$ given that the integer $x$ is fixed. A simple observation here is that if $f(x) = 2x + 1$ then asking if iterations of $f(1)$ contain infinitely many primes is equivalent to the Mersenne primes conjecture. P. S. This question seems to be related to the Bunyakovsky conjecture, so maybe somebody knows about any partial results in this direction? 

Back to 1980, P.Erd\H{o}s and C. Pomerance asked in their paper "Matching the natural numbers up to n with distinct multiples in another interval" (see page 160 of the journal scan $URL$ "Related to these questions, we ask if there is a large constant $c$ so that in any interval of length $cn$ there are $\pi(n)-\pi(n/2)$ distinct multiples of the primes in $(n/2, n]$ (there need not be a matching). " I am wondering if there is any progress on this question. Also, can we say anything if we require only some prime multiples to be present (e. g. we want to guarantee that there are distinct multiples of at least $O(n/\log n)$ primes from $(n/2, n]$)? 

A nice Lemma due to Konyagin asserts that for any subset $B \subset \mathbb{F}_p$ holds $$ |B.B - B.B + B.B - B.B + B.B - B.B| \geq \frac{1}{2}\min\{p, |B|^2 \}, $$ where the standard notation for the product set $B.B$ is used. Now suppose that instead of $B.B$ we have a partial productset $B\stackrel{G}{.}B$ along the edges of a graph $G$ of edge density $\epsilon$ (meaning that $b_1b_2 \in B\stackrel{G}{.}B$ if only if $b_1, b_2 \in B$ are adjacent in $G$). Is it true that if $B < \sqrt{p}$ a similar estimate $$ |B\stackrel{G}{.}B + B\stackrel{G}{.}B + B\stackrel{G}{.}B - B\stackrel{G}{.}B - B\stackrel{G}{.}B - B\stackrel{G}{.}B| \gg_{\epsilon} |B|^2 $$ holds? UPD Sorry for sloppy notation. So what it means. $B.B = \{b_ib_j |b_i, b_j \in B \}$, $B.B-B.B = \{b_ib_j - b_kb_l |b_i, b_j, b_k, b_k \in B\}$, and $B.B+B.B$ etc. being defined the same way. 

Let $X$ be a projective variety. The sheaf $\mathcal{E}xt^{1}(\Omega_{X},\mathcal{O}_{X})$ is supported on $Sing(X)$. Now, there should be a theorem (perhaps by Schlessinger) that says that if $X$ has finite quotient singularities and $codim(Sing(X))\geq 3$ then $\mathcal{E}xt^{1}(\Omega_{X},\mathcal{O}_{X}) = 0$. However I can not find a reference for this. A reference will help. Now, let say that there is a component $Y$ of $Sing(X)$ in codimension two. So $\mathcal{E}xt^{1}(\Omega_{X},\mathcal{O}_{X})$ should be supported on $Y$. If, in this particular setting, we know that $Ext^{1}(\Omega_{X},\mathcal{O}_{X}) = 0$ can we say something about $\mathcal{E}xt^{1}(\Omega_{X},\mathcal{O}_{X})$? 

The irreducible components of the normalization $\mathcal{B}^{\nu}$ of the boundary $\mathcal{B}\subset\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}$ are finite images of the moduli spaces: 

The stack $\overline{\mathcal{P}}_{g}$ of Prym curves is a smooth Deligne-Mumford stack. This implies that its coarse moduli space $\overline{P}_{g}$ is normal with at most fine quotient singularities. 

At the best of my knowledge what is know about complete intersection is the follwing: Varieties in an affine space. 

Let $Y$ be an affine scheme over a field of characteristic zero. Suppose we have a group $G$ acting on $Y$ and that the subset of $Y$ of points with non-trivial stabilizer is in codimension greater or equal than $3$. Then, by a theorem due to Schlessinger $X:=Y/G$ is rigid that is $X$ does not have non-trivial first order deformations. I know that a quadric cone in $\mathbb{A}^{3}$ admits non-trivial first order deformations. Does anyone know an example of a $3$-fold with finite quotient singularities and singular in codimension $2$ admitting non-trivial first order deformations? Is it true the naive statement: "the dimension of the space of deformations is bigger for a bad singularity than for a mild one"? For instance is it true that non-canonical singularities are not rigid? Thank you very much. 

A classical theorem of Cassels states that if a homogenous quadratic form $Q$ has an integer zero, then there is a zero of small height (bounded solely by the coefficients and number of variables). Birch and Davenport extended this result to an arbitrary lattice $\Lambda$. Now suppose there is an integer lattice $\Lambda$ in $\mathbb{R}^{kl}$ and it is known that there is a vector $v \in \Lambda$ of the form $$ v =(\lambda_1 w, \lambda_2 w, \ldots, \lambda_kw), $$ where $\lambda_i$ are integers and $w$ is an integer vector in $\mathbb{R}^l$. Of course, such a condition is equivalent to multiple quadratic relations $X_iX_j - X_kX_l = 0$. I am wondering if one can then guarantee the existence of such $v$ with bounded height (polynomial in $\det(\Lambda))$)? It seems that in general there are no meaningful generalisations of Cassels' theorem to simultaneous quadratic forms. 

Recall that a graph is called $k$-chordal if any cycle $C$ of length $> k$ contains a chord, i.e. an edge joining to non-consecutive vertices in $C$. Let $f(n, k)$ be the minimal number of edges s.t. any graph on $n$ vertices can be made $k$-chordal by deleting at most $f(n, k)$ edges. There is a paper of Erd\H{o}s and Laskar "On maxinal chordal subgraph" where they show that $$ f(n,3) = \frac{n^2}{2} - (1+o(1))\sqrt{2}n^{3/2}. $$ I am wondering if other bounds for $f(n, k)$ are known for bigger $k$. A bound in terms of the number of edges is also of interest. In particular, is is true that there is some bounded $k$ s.t. $$ f(n, k) = o(|E|), $$ where $E$ is the number of edges? UPD The answer for the last question is NO, as seen from the following example. Take $k+1$ copies of $K_{n/(k+1)}$, call it $G_0, ..., G_k$. Join all vertices in $G_i$ and $G_{i+1}$ (addition mod $(k+1)$). One can show that for this graph $f(n, k) \geq n^2/4(k+1)^2$. It is interesting to see what is the right constant, though. 

Yes, the issue concerns singularities of the pair $(X,\epsilon D)$. Assume that $-K_X$ is big then $-K_X -\epsilon D = -(K_X+\epsilon D)$ is ample for some effictive divisor $D$ and some positive rational number $\epsilon >0$. If $(X,\epsilon D)$ is a klt pair (that is $X$ is a log Fano variety) then, by BCHM $X$ is a Mori Dream Space. If $-K_X$ is also nef (that is $X$ is weak Fano) then one can choose $\epsilon$ arbitrairly small and $(X,\epsilon D)$ is klt. Then $X$ is log Fano and therefore a Mori Dream space. So far we have $X$ weak Fano $\Rightarrow$ $X$ log Fano $\Rightarrow$ $X$ Mori Dream Space. Now, if $-K_X$ is big but not nef, one may find $\epsilon$ big enough to have $-(K_X+\epsilon D)$ ample but at the same time $\epsilon$ is not small enough in order to ensure that $(X,\epsilon D)$ is klt. This is true even for surfaces, as Artie wrote you may take a look to Section 3 of $URL$ Therefore $X$ log Fano $\Rightarrow$ $-K_X$ big. However, $-K_X$ big does not imply $X$ log Fano. The fact is that in order to prove that $X$ is a Mori Dream Space one does not need to pass first from the fact that $X$ is log Fano. Indeed if $X$ is a Mori Dream Space then it is not necessarily log Fano. For instance the surfaces in Section 3 of $URL$ are Mori Dream Spaces but not log Fano. Indeed, in $URL$ they prove that a rational surface $X$ such that $-K_X$ is big is a Mori Dream Space by showing that $Cox(X)$ is finitely generated. In general, it is not true that $-K_X$ big implies that $X$ is a Mori Dream Space. If $X$ is a normal projective variety and $D$ is a $\mathbb{Q}$-divisor, we say that $(X, D)$ is a weak log Fano pair if $âˆ’(K_X + D)$ is nef and big. In particular, $-K_X-D = B$ is big and $-K_X = B+D$ is big as well being the sum of a big divisor and an effective divisor. Example $5.6$ of $URL$ describes a smooth $3$-fold with $-K_X$ big, but $X$ is not a MDS. Namely $X$ is the blow-up of the vertex of the cone over $S$, where $S$ is $\mathbb{P}^2$ blown-up at $9$ general points. 

It is well known that for a given polynomial $f \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ the number of primes $p$ s.t. $f$ has a root modulo $p$ is infinite. In fact, one can even write down a formula for the density of such primes (e.g. D. Berend, Y. Bilu "Polynomials with roots modulo every integer"). Now suppose that $f = \sum_{i=0}^d a_ix^i$ is irreducible, the degree $d$ is fixed and all $a_i \leq N^C$ for some constant $C$. Is it possible to prove the uniform bound (e.g. whith the constant depending only on $d$ and $C$ and $N$ large) $$ \pi(N, f) = \Omega_{d, C}(\frac{N}{\log N}), $$ where $\pi(N, f)$ means the number of primes less than $N$ s.t. $f$ has a root modulo $p$? The aforementioned paper cites a general density formula due to Lagarias and Odlyzko which seem to provide such a bound assuming GRH. It's of course highly desirable to drop this assumption. 

If you divide on $a$ and let $a$ to be big you have basically a set of linear inequalities of the form $1-o(1) \geq b_ic-d_i \geq o(1)$. If you look at $b_ic$ geometrically, it is a beam of lines emanating from zero with slopes $b_1, ..., b_{a-1}$. And you want to find a point $c$ such that the line $x = c$ intersects each line in a strip $1+d_i-o(1) \geq y \geq d_i+o(1)$. It seems that if you order the lines according to the slope and starting from the line with the smallest slope (smallest $b_i$) it is possible to choose $d_i$ for each new line appropriately (based on the geometric representation above) 

Let $\mathcal{X}$ be an algebraic stack over $k$. A coarse moduli space for $\mathcal{X}$ over $k$ is a morphism $\pi:\mathcal{X}\rightarrow X$, where $X$ is a scheme such that: 

The divisor $H-E$ (pull-back of the linear system of planes through the blown-up point $p$) does not separate points. Indeed if $q\in\mathbb{P}^{3}$ and $t\in\left\langle p,q\right\rangle$ then any plane through $q$ passing through $p$ contains $t$ as well. The divisor $H-E$ induces the resolution of the rational projection of $\mathbb{P}^{3}$ from $p$. Then $H-E$ is nef but not ample. Now, we prove that $dH-E$ is ample (indeed very ample) for any $d\geq 2$. For any couple of point $q,t\in\mathbb{P}^{3}$ we can find a surface of degree $d\geq 2$ trough $p,q$ but not passing through $t$. Furthermore given a point $q\in\mathbb{P}^{3}$ and a tangent direction $v_q$ at $q$ we can find a surface $S$ of degree $d\geq 2$ through $p,q$ such that $v_q$ is not a tangent direction through $S$. Furthermore the base locus of $|\mathcal{I}_{p}(d)|$ is just $p$. Then $dH-E$ is base point free, separates points and tangent directions. Therefore it induces an embedding of $Bl_p\mathbb{P}^3$ to $\mathbb{P}(H^{0}(\mathbb{P}^3,\mathcal{I}_p(d)))$ and $dH-E$ is very ample for $d\geq 2$. For instance $2H-E$ (the space of quadrics through a point has dimension $9$) induces an embedding $f:Bl_p\mathbb{P}^3\rightarrow\mathbb{P}(H^{0}(\mathbb{P}^3,\mathcal{I}_p(2)))\cong\mathbb{P}^8$ and $X = Im(f)\subset\mathbb{P}^8$ is a smooth $3$-fold of degree $8-1 = 7$. 

Smooth varieties Let $X$ be a smooth uniruled variety. Then there is a free rational curve $f:\mathbb{P}^1\rightarrow X$, that is $H^1(\mathbb{P}^1,f^*T_X\otimes\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1}(-1)) = 0$. Now $f^{*}T_X$ is a rank $n = dim(X)$ vector bundle on $\mathbb{P}^1$. Therefore we can write $$f^*T_X = \mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1}(a_1)\oplus...\oplus\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1}(a_n).$$ Now, $f^{*}T_X$ contains $T_{\mathbb{P}^1}\cong\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1}(2)$. We have $K_X\cdot f_*\mathbb{P}^1 = -\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_i\leq -2$. Therefore, $X$ uniruled implies that there is a free rational curve on $X$ which implies that $K_X$ is not nef. So, if $K_X$ is ample (in particular $K_X$ is nef) then $X$ is not uniruled. Now, $X$ unirational $\Rightarrow$ $X$ rationally connected $\Rightarrow$ $X$ uniruled $\Rightarrow$ $K_X$ is not nef (in particular $K_X$ is not ample). In other terms. If $X$ is uniruled then $X$ has nagative Kodaira dimension. If the canonical bundle of $X$ is ample (it is enough big) then $X$ has Kodaira dimension $dim(X)$. Singular varieties There are singular uniruled varieties with ample canonical bundle. In particular there are many examples of rational singular surfaces with ample canonical bundle. The following example is due to Kollar. You can find the details and many other interesting constructions here $URL$ Let us consider the surface $$Y = Y(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4) := (x_1^{a_1}x_2 + x_2^{a_2}x_3 + x_3^{a_3}x_4 + x_4^{a_4}x_1 = 0)$$ in the weighted projective space $\mathbb{P}(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4)$, such that $$a_1w_1+w_2 = a_2w_2 + w_3 = a_3w_3 + w_4 = a_4w_4+w_1 = d$$ and $$\begin{array}{ll} w_1 = \frac{1}{w^*}(a_2 a_3 a_4-a_3 a_4+a_4-1), & w_2 = \frac{1}{w^*}(a_1 a_3 a_4-a_1 a_4+a_1-1),\\ w_3 = \frac{1}{w^*}(a_1 a_2 a_4-a_1 a_2 + a_2-1), & w_4 = \frac{1}{w^*}(a_1 a_2 a_3- a_2 a_3 + a_3-1), \end{array}$$ $$d = \frac{1}{w^*}(a_1 a_2 a_3 a_4-1)$$ where $w^* = \gcd(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4).$ If $w^* = 1$, then $Y$ is a rational surface with $4$ cyclic singularities and $H_2(Y, \mathbb{Q}) \cong \mathbb{Q}^3$. The rational curves $$C_1 := (x_1 = x_3 = 0),\quad C_2 := (x_2 = x_4 = 0)$$ are extremal rays with respect the $K_Y + (1- \epsilon)(C_1 + C_2)$ minimal model program for $0 < \epsilon \ll 1$. Therefore $C_1$ and $C_2$ are contractible to quotient singularities and we get a rational surface of Picard number 1, $$\pi : Y=Y(a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4) \rightarrow X = X(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4).$$ If $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4 \geq 4$, then $K_{X}$ is ample. For examples of big surfaces with big cotangent bundle you could take a look at this $URL$ For a classification of complex compact Gorenstein surfaces with negative canonical bundle you can read this $URL$ A classical example of a rational surface with negative canonical bundle is the quadric cone in $\mathbb{P}^3$. The canonical divisor $K_S$ is $-2H_{|S}$, where $H$ is a plane in $\mathbb{P}^3$ through the vertex. 

Let $a_1, ..., a_d$ be positive reals and consider the linear Diophantine equation $$ \sum_i a_in_i = 0. $$ I am interested in estimating the number of integer solutions of this equation inside a box $[-N_1, N_1] \times ... \times [-N_d, N_d]$ and also the minimal basis for the corresponding integer lattice in terms of $a_1,...,a_d$. More specifically, it seems that if the number of solutions is of order $N^{d-1}$ then $(a_1, ...., a_d)$ should be proportional to some integer vector of bounded norm. Presumably, smth much more precise is known. I believe that such kind of questions are well studied so any good reading on this topic would be highly appreciated. 

There is a paper by Gy\H{o}ry and Lemons "Hypergraphs with No Cycle of a Given Length", which bounds number of hyperedges for hypergraphs avoiding cycles of length $2k$ (unfortunately, I have access only to the abstract: $URL$ Particularly, in the case of a uniform 4-hypergraph avoiding 2-cycles it seems to provide $O(n^2)$ bound. I am wondering if it is possible to improve this to $o(n^2)$ or it is sharp? Here 2-cycle simply means two hyperedges $E_1, E_2$ which intersect in $2$ vertices. 

I think that conjecture is true. Let $a$, $b$ be two non-adjacent vertices. I claim that $H = G \setminus \{a, b\}$ must contain exactly two connected components. Indeed, if it has more than two, we can take any of these, say $H_1$, and $H_1 \cup \{a, b\}$ will be connected while the rest of $G$ not. On the other hand, the case of a single component $H$ is also impossible since otherwise $G \setminus H$ is just pair of vertices $a$ and $b$ and it is disconnected. Thus, $G$ consists of two components $H_1$ and $H_2$ and $a$ and $b$ in between. Now I claim that $H_1$ is just a path from $a$ to $b$. First, since $G \setminus H_2$ is connected, there should be some path $l$ from $a$ to $b$ which lies entirely in $H_1$. On the other hand, $H_1$ cannot contain any other vertices since otherwise $G \setminus \{l \cup a \cup b \}$ is disconnected. The same holds for $H_2$. Thus, $G$ originally was just a cycle. 

The product $\mathbb{P}^1\times\mathbb{P}^1$ is quadric surface $X\subset\mathbb{P}^3$. The canonical divisor is $K_X = -2H_X$, where $H_X = X\cap H$, and $H$ is the hyperplane section. Blowing-up a point in $X$ you get a surface $X_1$ with $$K_{X_1} = -2H_X+E_1.$$ In general blowing-up $k$ points in $X$ you have $$K_{X_k} = -2H_{X}+E_1+...+E_k.$$ Now, take $X_1$ and blow-up a point $p\in E_1$. Let $\pi:Y\rightarrow X_1$ be the blow-up. Then $-K_Y = \pi^*K_{X_1}+E_2$. We have $\pi^*K_{X_1} = \pi^*(-2H_X+E_1) = -2H_X+E_1+E_2$ because $p$ is a smooth point of the curve $E_1$. Therefore $$-K_Y = \pi^*K_{X_1}+E_2 = -2H_X+E_1+2E_2.$$ Then, you can go on like this. Of couse here I am using the same notation for a curve and its strict transform. 

Let $Y$ be a rationally connected variety over an algebraically closed field, and let $$\phi:X\dashrightarrow Y$$ be a rational fibration such that the general fiber of $\phi$ is rationally chain connected. Is it true that $X$ is rationally chain connected? If we assume that the general fiber of $\phi$ is smooth and rationally connected can we conclude that $X$ is rationally connected? 

Here is the answer for the Grassmannian of lines in $\mathbb{P}^3$. You can imitate this argumet in the general case of $k$-subspaces containing a fixed $(k-1)$-space or contained in a fixed $(k+1)$-space. For any point $p\in\mathbb{P}^3$ be $\Sigma_{p}\subset\mathbb{G}(1,3)\subset\mathbb{P}^5$ be the locus parametrizing lines in $\mathbb{P}^3$ through $p$. Similarly, for any plane $H\subset\mathbb{P}^3$ be $\Sigma_{H}\subset\mathbb{G}(1,3)\subset\mathbb{P}^5$ be the locus parametrizing lines in $\mathbb{P}^3$ contained in $H$. Let $u\in V$ be a vector representing $p\in\mathbb{P}^3$. Then the lines through $p$ are represented by $2$-vectors of the form $u\wedge v$. Let $\{u,u_1,u_2,u_3\}$ be a basis of $V$. Then we may write $v = \alpha u+\beta_1 u_1+\beta_2 u_2+\beta_3 u_3$, and $$u\wedge v = \alpha_1(u\wedge u_1)+\alpha_2(u\wedge u_2)+\alpha_3(u\wedge u_3).$$ Therefore, lines through $p$ are represented by the points of the plane spanned by $u\wedge u_1$, $u\wedge u_2$ and $u\wedge u_3$. Now, the lines contained in the plane $H\subset\mathbb{P}^3$, by duality corresponds to the lines in $\mathbb{P}^{3^{*}}$ through the point $H^{*}$. Therefore they are parametrized by a plane in $\mathbb{G}(1,3)$ by the part above. Now, take a plane $\Pi$ in $\mathbb{G}(1,3)$ and three points $l,r,s$ in this plane that do not lie on the same line. Let $L,R,S\subset\mathbb{P}^3$ be the corresponding lines. Since the three lines joining $l$,$r$ and $s$ are on the same plane contained in $\mathbb{G}(1,3)$ they intersect and they are contained in $\mathbb{G}(1,3)$. Therefore, the lines $L,R,S$ intersect. We have two cases.
