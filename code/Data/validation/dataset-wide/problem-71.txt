So I was thinking the other day. We all know the muscles in our body twitch and make microscopic movements invisible to us every day, and quite frequently. Microsaccades in the eyes are just one example of everyday muscle movement we don't control and aren't aware of. Then I got to thinking. If you had the sort of superheroic strength that could topple buildings like Superman and other flying bricks, how devastating would these normally invisible muscle movements be? Would every involuntary twitch create shockwaves like your mighty punches? Would the beating of your heart be enough to create deadly overpressure that would cause internal bleeding or organ damage in anyone that gets too close to you? Essentially, when you become super strong, does your body's involuntary movements make you into a walking disaster area, like a human bomb? I'd really like to know what everyone thinks about this and if my estimates are wrong, how strong a superhero would need to be just to kill someone with muscle spasms or their heartbeat? 

Adaptive shapeshifters that rapidly assimilate other life forms and steal their useful traits, basically. Could these exist or is it scientifically impossible? 

Let's assume you have access to some pretty crazy tech but that you still have to obey the basic rules of biology. If you build your cyborg so that the only remaining squishy bits are the brain and perhaps a few others like the heart and digestive system (though it is my understanding that everything but the brain should be theoretically optional as long as you have mechanical analogues that can provide nutrients and oxygen to the brain), your tin-man will obviously be physically superior to a normal human. That goes without saying. But can they catch a bullet? While a sufficiently sturdy machine should be capable of doing this (I think), the brain obviously isn't. Even if we assume you've overclocked your organic brain's processing power with some form of nanotechnology or additional cybernetic enhancement so that it can react in time to dodge a bullet, the g-forces you'll be subjecting it to by moving it out of the way of the bullet's projected flight path (even by a marginal amount) will turn that poor defenseless lump of meat into a skull full of jelly. That's why you don't DODGE the bullet. You catch and/or preferably deflect it, only moving your completely mechanical limbs and sparing your squishy head from having to accelerate to a few thousand gs. But does that really work? Would simply moving one of the mechanical parts of your body at high speeds to intercept a fast-moving projectile keep your organic body parts safe from the strain you'd otherwise be putting on them, or is this just a drastic oversimplification of the forces acting on this cyborg when they attempt to catch/deflect a bullet without moving their head or neck? 

How could I justify shapeshifting into a large-ish monster using hard science? The transformation from man to monster is pretty drastic, so I'm assuming the transformation would at a minimum take upwards of a few days to a week of slow metamorphosis and gorging one's self on thousands of kilocalories worth of raw materials, but is there any way to accelerate the process? Additionally, what would be the most likely culprit of such a transformation in a hard sci fi setting? Gene therapy? Nanomachines? 

Assuming you already had sufficient money and resources to build a tower stretching from the top of Europa's ice layer down to the bottom of the seabed, could you build it on top of one of its geysers to take advantage of both an easy access point as well as a sustainable source of clean geothermal energy? Or are the geysers too powerful for any man-made structure to maintain its structural integrity? 

Moreover, could a culture of microorganisms form a collective hive-intelligence similar to ants or bees? I'm trying to design a scientifically plausible hive-mind, and I'm trying to decide whether the best option is to merely utilize tiny aquatic insects with the conventional type of hive-intelligence displayed by certain species on Earth (only extrapolated so that the hive, when working together, is not only conscious but can out-think the entire human population or a futuristic supercomputer), or to create bacteria with some primitive level of intelligence that can communicate with others of its kind over long distances, possibly via radio waves, to form a giant brain with distributed intelligence like an octopus. Which of these is more plausible scientifically, and which would seem more different psychologically when compared to humans? 

Let's say you're an alien and you want to make sure your species outlives your planet or whatever disaster you currently face, whether it be natural or engineered. You load up a bunch of self-replicating spacecraft to seed any planets they pass that have complex life with a highly infectious retrovirus (or nanovirus if you feel like there should be/want there to be nanotechnology involved) that will insert modified genes into that organism that will cause it and/or its offspring to develop some of your species' prominent traits, ensuring that your genetic information continues to propagate after you're gone. Could this work? Would this be a realistic and/or feasible way to either colonize the cosmos or ensure the propagation of your doomed species? What complications might there be for infected organisms? Assume they have access to arbitrarily complex bio or nanotechnology (within the laws of physics). 

I know A LOT of this gonna be a stretch and that I'm probably misunderstanding or exaggerating current real-life trends in science, but that's kind of why I'm asking the question. We know it's possible to use bacteria to form simple logic gates like computers: $URL$ Furthermore, the basis of CRISPR, our newest, most powerful tool for genetic engineering, is a process used by bacteria to defend against viruses. Therefore, extrapolating these two findings and throwing in the slightly hand-wavey inclusion of a sort of "bio-radio" that allows individual microorganisms to communicate with each other at a distance and form some sort of bacterial hive-mind computer (that may or may not work via some unexplained quirk of quantum entanglement a la the Bicameral Order of Peter Watts' novel Echopraxia), could this hypothetical hive entity then become self-aware and use its ability to coordinate and communicate its individual cells to play God by genetically engineering its own designer ecosystem? This organism is OLD, so time isn't a factor here. It could take this thing millions of years to figure out the method for manipulating its constituent microfauna in a way that emulates CRISPR and a couple dozen million years for it to start engineering life from nothing but its own cells and we'd still be right on schedule. It also doesn't matter if the bacterial computer was designed by someone else or evolved naturally. All I need to know right now is if this idea is plausible enough to hold up a book, or if the science is softer than a bucket of cookie dough. 

Okay, so while I'm fairly certain this is possible to do, I wanna know if it actually makes sense to do so. Imagine you have a fleet of ships, each of them so large it takes megatons of antimatter to get the fleet moving at anything resembling a decent speed. Even for antimatter, carrying that much fuel is gonna cause problems. If not in weight, then in the inherent dangers of storing enough volatile antimatter on your ship to cause a planetary extinction event. Anyone could tell you that despite the pressing need to get the ship moving, this is still a terrible fucking idea. So here's the solution I came up with. Build another huge ship that's completely unmanned and is basically a giant antimatter-catalyzed fusion reactor strapped to the universe's largest RC car, situate it in the middle of the fleet a few AU from every other ship just to be safe, and have it use tightbean lasers to transmit power wirelessly across multiple AU to receivers on the hull of all the other megaships in the fleet. Or at the very least, build a ton of smaller generator ships that'd serve the same purpose as one huge one. Does this make sense as a means of keeping the fleet going without risking having a bunch of exploding murder-fuel aboard your starship or is it less safe/efficient than just keeping your means of generating power confined to the ship? 

Or really, how could soldiers from the 21st century convince anyone living in antiquity that their weapons and technology are based on principles of science and engineering rather than witchcraft and black magic? I have a situation in which famous soldiers, warriors, demigods, and military/political leaders from all periods of history have been brought back to life (don't ask how or why, it's magic), given the gift of tongues so they are all fluent in each other's languages, and are basically set loose to encounter each other at random and mingle. If you want a comparison, think something like For Honor or the manga Drifters, just with a bit more focus on the fantasy/mythological aspects of the various peoples involved. The first major encounter is between a camp of a few hundred modern-day soldiers (probably US forces but let's not bias the answer towards any specific nationality) and a roving tribe of Amazonian warrior women. After the inevitable apocalyptic gender war (only mostly sarcasm), everyone's cooled their jets and a momentary peace has been established so each side can start explaining themselves. And it's gonna get really awkwards for the soldiers when the Amazonians start asking what those horseless metal chariots are and how they can point those black metal things at people, make a loud noise, and kill them from a hundred yards away without firing a bow. Let's assume that torches and pitchforks as well as other displays of aggression are off the table as a valid response by the Amazonians (if for no other reason than the soldiers keep pointing assault rifles at them while making really mean faces). How do the soldiers even begin to explain three thousand years of technological development in a way that won't totally break the brains of people from antiquity? And if that won't work, can they at least find a way to convince them that their super-advanced space-age weaponry isn't just magic? 

Imagine a gas giant orbiting Sirius B, a hot Jupiter. 120 million years ago give or take, the star reaches its final stage as a red giant then collapses into a white dwarf, ejecting countless billions of tons of hot gas and plasma at high speeds. The death of the star and its subsequent release blasts away the gas giant's, well, gas, leaving just enough to form an Earth-like atmosphere around the gas giant's now exposed rocky core. 120 million years pass. Humans discover this planet, and decide to investigate it. Would it be possible for them to find prehistoric life when they arrive? Complex organisms too, like insects and land animals. 

Or vice versa. Let's assume humanity or some equally advanced intelligent species discovers life, or even a plethora of life, out amongst the stars, and decides that they want to make contact to see how intelligent they are. But instead of sending them sensible things like mathematical proofs and other various equations, we decide we're going to have a little fun messing around with these aliens and format our intelligence test like a game or series of games. Because apparently we enjoy the sounds millions of frustrated aliens make as they get stuck playing unforgiving 90s point and click adventure games and old escape the room Flash puzzles. But how would we convey the idea of a game or challenge to them, much less the rules? Given the broad variety of alien psychologies and physiologies potentially on display here, what would our best bets be if we want to put together a collection of games to launch to the aliens in the hopes that they'll recognize a few of them? Squid-people can't exactly play soccer or tennis, and many human games that don't involve physical activity (the kind that might be incompatible with certain body plans) rely on what might be considered uniquely human logic (see the adventure games mentioned above, as well as almost every videogame ever besides Pong). So what kind of games could we send to these unknown aliens in the hopes that we'll have at least a few of them in common? (Off the bat, my first couple guesses were pattern-matching games, games that subtly incorporate different kinds of math, and perhaps maybe simple strategy games like go, shogi or chess that require a dynamic and flexible approach to problem solving. However, even these have issues) 

Or is this just another example of rule of cool taking precedence over practicality? What structural or design flaws might exist in a hot knife, and what problems might they pose for a soldier trying to use one? These knives would be used to perform battlefield amputations as well as to cauterize wounds to prevent blood loss and infection in a near-future setting where biological warfare has become more common. 

How far outside of the solar system would it need to be to not have any negatives effects on the planets within? The wormhole has to be large enough to fit say an aircraft carrier though it. Could you put it in the Kuiper belt or the Oort cloud? 

I’ve heard that bodies of water boasting high salinities tend to turn red due to seasonal algae blooms. I have a river in a fantasy setting I’m working on that’s blood red year-round, and I want to kind of subtly hint to the readers that this is the actual reason the river is red, rather than the local juju and other superstitions (because medieval folk probably wouldn’t understand the idea of microscopic organisms turning the water into blood). However I’m not too familiar with the details of these blooms or what environmental factors can permanently cause a river to become highly saturated with salt. My immediate, most brute-force caveman idea was to have the waterfall that feeds into this river cut through what amounts to a hill or a small mountain of salt, giving it the nickname “Leech’s Knee” (with the angular waterfall being a bent knee and the red water below being the blood flowing from it after one has plucked or salted a leech). I don’t know if this would actually work however, or if there is a more elegant solution. Can anyone lend me a hand? 

Imagine you've somehow tranquilized or tied up Superman with a kryptonite rope or something, and the military wants to do a stress test so they can start building a series of anti-Superman bombs. So they drop increasingly large nuclear devices on him, upping the yield until they can noticeably injure Superman and thus determine the upper limit of his invulnerability. But there's a bigger problem here than mad science or pissing off Superman. It's the limits of our weapons technology. Which leads me to ask. What's the practical limit for building bombs with today's technology? And I don't mean practical as in efficient or cost-effective. As long as the bomb works and works reliably, that'll do. All it's designed to do is injure a single superhumanly durable target, so it doesn't matter if using it in war on a soft civilian target would be excessive or impractical. Also, saying "antimatter" is forbidden. It has to be doable right now.
