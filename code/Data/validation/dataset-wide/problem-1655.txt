These are not the standard calculations of tax wedges as measured internationally, as well as being over a decade out of date. A better source might be the OECD's publication Taxing Wages. The 2016 report (page 19) includes the following numbers for tax wedges as a % of labour costs in 2015 for a single person (no family) on average wages: 

Much of the pay gap is explained by motherhood, in that working mothers earn much less on average than working fathers, and the average gap is less between childless working men and women. Because people are more likely to be parents as they get older, this has an effect on the relationship between pay, gender and age. You can see some UK numbers on page 8 here: women's median pay is 95% of men's for 22-29 year olds but 76% for 50-59 year olds. A harder question is how much of this involves a choice (with many mothers often choosing more flexible work which happens to be lower paid). In the UK, women are less likely to work than men at each age group, but unemployment rates (i.e. those looking for work who cannot find it) are similar at each age group up to about 50. After 50, women are dramatically less likely to be looking for work than men of the same age. Part of this may be due to lower formal retirement ages, though there may also be women who want to stop work at the same time as their (on average) older husbands. Some UK numbers can be found on tab 2(2) here showing unemployment rates of 8.2% for men and 7.3% for 25-34 year olds, compared with 5.8% for men and 3.4% for women for 50-65 year olds. Not working looks likely to be voluntary for many older women. 

I suspect it also excludes employees' private contributions, but does not see these as potentially part of a wedge between gross labour costs and net pay. So a country which funds these through taxes or social security might be expected to have a higher tax wedge than one which does not. 

David Lloyd George died in 1945. In 1971 his secretary and second wife Frances published Lloyd George: A Diary saying for 9 March 1934 (page 259): 

Mercury is toxic in its elemental liquid and vapour forms and in its compounds, though to different degrees. Hence the advice from the US EPA on how to deal with spills. Like all liquids, mercury will continue to evaporate until it reaches its saturated vapour pressure or it is completely gaseous. While the liquid and vapour are toxic, elemental mercury poisoning is rarely fatal, though there was a reported case of a dental assistant who died after continued exposure. According to this review, after a high acute exposure to mercury vapour, symptoms such as cough, dyspnoea, chest tightness, lethargy, restlessness, fever and signs of pneumonitis can develop. As with most toxins, the higher the dose, the more serious the response. Minor cases, such as a broken thermometer, are much less serious, but advice (such as that from the EPA) on to deal with the spill including opening a window, and what not to do including using a vacuum cleaner, should be followed. 

The source of electricity may be a bigger issue than tyres and brakes. The Economist had a recent article "Cleaner than what? Why an electric car may be much dirtier than a petrol one". It concluded 

Since 2457842149 is not a seven character number, it is not a US patent. Since it does not start with a date format it is not a US patent application. Perhaps it comes from somewhere else. 

Your linked article has its own pointers to the issue: it says that the screening for being a carrier of a single mutation for beta thalassemia is compulsory and that the state (with religious backing) prevents marriage between carriers even if unrelated. This degree of compulsion is moving towards a eugenics policy and is similar to the past compulsory screening of African-Americans for sickle-cell anaemia (another recessive blood disorder) in several US states until the 1970s. Being identified as a carrier of such diseases can lead to stigmatisation. The typical ethical position for genetic screening is that it should be voluntary and the results should be private, to avoid genetic discrimination, even if this privacy may adversely affect other family members. Some of the ethical issues on screening were discussed in Nature Education, though related to Huntingdon's disease. The more general issue has led to laws such as the US Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008. For a more speculative view of where widespread genetic screening might lead, consider the film Gattaca. 

Oddthinking's pointer to David Frost in 1966 shows the use in film making, but the over-literal interpretation of the title of position (in fact a minister without portfolio who had historically looked after the monarch's private seal) was promoted by Edward Heath (Lord Privy Seal 1961-1963), which he attributed to Ernest Bevin (Lord Privy Seal 1951), saying he 

One approach could be to test (hopped) alcohol-free beer. A study looking at this was The Sedative Effect of Non-Alcoholic Beer in Healthy Female Nurses, Franco et al, PLoS One. 2012; 7(7). Among other things, its conclusions were 

It is true that for Fiscal Year 2016, the Congressional Budget Office reported in January 2016 there were $310 billion of appropriations with expired authorizations: see any of the three almost identical pdf reports at $URL$ though note that the 2017 number would be different It is not true that these are illegal appropriations. Congress is its own judge of whether its rules are being broken or can be waived or otherwise applied. If it appropriates funds in an Act, signed by the President, then those appropriations are legal. This is explained in the article you took the claim from If for example appropriations for running the State Department have not been authorized since 2004, it would not be reasonable to describe the State Department as one of the "zombie programs and failed agencies" mentioned in your link for this reason. It is instead an example of how Congress has made its own processes less functional over recent years 

The Fukushima Daiichi incident was a second Chernobyl. Both were rated as 7 on the International Nuclear Event Scale i.e. a Major Accident, the highest on the scale. By comparison, both Three Mile Island in 1979 and the Windscale fire in 1957 were rated 5, an accident with wider consequences. At Fukushima, (according to this IAEA review) reactors 1, 2 and 3 had meltdowns and reactors 1, 3 and 4 had hydrogen explosions in the reactor buildings, releasing radioactive material into the environment and causing an evacuation eventually extending 30 kilometers in radius plus some special areas, affecting 160,000 residents. They were both extremely serious, though the details were different, and the death toll was much lower in Fukushima, mainly because of the deaths of firefighters in Chernobyl. The 13-15,000 deaths in the Japanese earthquake and tsunami, mainly by drowning, was far higher than either. 

It rather depends on what you mean by normal weight. The standard definition is to use Body Mass Index (weight in kg divided by square of height in metres) and describe normal as something like 20-25, overweight as 25-30 and obese as 30+. There are issues about this simple rule of thumb, since it ignores body type, and there seems to be no reason to believe that the power of two in the denominator is the correct number (it certainly is not for children and may not be for tall people). But ignoring those questions and just looking at epidemiological evidence, this study from the Journal of the American Medical Association says
