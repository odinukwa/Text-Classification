As a conclusion, I'd rather bet on something with 2/3 confirmed and one pending rather than something with zero evidence whatsoever and zero possibilities of future testing. 

Therefore, the chance that you select in advance the one that I picked is zero, but it is not impossible. 

Yes, it is possible. Let's say we have an area where we have 3 classes that handle 3 types of animals: pigs, cows and sheep. They are all grouped by the type of animal they grow. They are equal and trade between groups. There is no extra power for a specific group. Within each group, you can have a status. Certain members may care better than other for their animals. This is inevitable. But no power is needed to have status and class in this example. 

And for the second part: why it is venerated after death - well, it's because it no longer represents a danger and they can let the true value of the dead one be revealed. 

If you are in group A (one of the group of 5) you have the same chance of survival as group B (the group of one). That is the logic. Of course, the utilitarianism part can come into debate, but it's not related to the chance itself. It should be clear that each individual has a 50-50 chance if there are 2 groups and a coin; it is irrelevant how many are in each group. -Later Edit- The ethical part in this would actually be if to toss the coin. Because if you do, you may choose the 5-group unwillingly. But is that worse than choosing the 1-group ? There can be situations where 1 must be saved instead of 5, although most would choose to save the 5. But if you make a choice to save the 5, because they are more lives, where do you draw the line ? Will you terminate 999998 to save 999999 ? Such things cannot be put into math, there can be way too many factors involved in such decision. 

Yes, it remains possible. The existence of a deity is a plausible event. Even if it is mathematically improbable, it remains possible. Impossibility implies zero probability, but the reverse is false: zero probability does not mean impossibility. 

Note that we are talking strictly about geometrical dimensions, not other things that may be considered a dimension. Visualize: certainly no. You cannot view an N-dimensional object from a N-1 dimension. When you draw a cube on a paper you do not visualize the 3D cube, you visualize a 2D image and using extrapolation based on the fact that you recognize a 3D cube (because you have seen in in 3D before, so you have your extrapolation end point), you determine that your drawing is a representation of a 3D cube. Extrapolate on how it would look: possibly. 

Matter can self-create out of rolling waves, given the proper parameters are met. This has been tested and is both physically and mathematically proved. The opposite easy to recreate, as there are many examples of dissipating particles in the form of heat. I won't go into deeps physics here, it's kind of off-topic. Independent limited systems that are correctly connected can result in something better than their sum. Let's say we have 2 systems that have inputs and outputs. Each system will have a constant input and a constant output. Of course, each system will output something and that's it. It will not be able to alter that output on it's own. But if you connect the output of system 1 to the input of system 2 and vice-versa, you will have outputs that vary accordingly to the feedback received from the respective sub-part. Therefore, the total is more than it's parts. This example is very basic, but is what can lead to a completely self-aware AIs, artificial consciousness. But one may argue that someone intentionally connected the 2 initial systems to end up in the given above configuration. Well, that is not 100% needed. If you throw a big stack of pieces that have contacts somewhere, there's a high chance you will get various connections including the ones specified above. So external intervention is not really necessary. The part not yet complete is the actual biological evolutionary part. Proof is lacking a lot when it comes to species evolution from one into another, but this may be judged in another manner. Instead of evolving from one species to another, this may have happened differently. Because of the basic blocks are nearly identical, it's much more likely that there was a common life-template from which all species evolved rather than the Darwinian line. Unfortunately this theory is insufficiently tested at this point. 

Perhaps more people should try to prove that God can exist instead of trying to prove it does not. Just as branches of science (mainly physics) dig into how the Universe came to existence and up to this point its been able to prove that particles can form out of energy/waves and can dissipate into energy/waves without a 'creator' interfering, in a similar manner, other areas of science dig into the power of conscience, collective conscience and all possibilities that can result from a collective conscience, including the special proprieties of various levels of consciousness. By proving the true capabilities of different levels of consciousness science could prove that a being with the capability of altering the physical world can exist, therefore God can exist as an Universal creator. Additionally to that, in time, science can become so advanced that it may even discover way more than the inter-works of collective conscience, maybe as fast as acutally finding the creator, assuming there is one. 

Regarding another comment from here, in many cases yes, physicists have absolutely no interest in philosophy, but that's not too relevant for the ones that do, like the author here, myself or many others. I'm a researcher with doctor's degree in physics and I like philosophy a lot, I even hold philosophy seminars. Generally speaking, when in physics you get to a halt given by an absurdity, it's best that you use logic and philosophy to be able to be out-of-the-box. Otherwise, you may be stuck in a no-solutions loop. You end up with theories supported by absurd math that have no practical application or value whatsoever. The impasse in physics today is the result of false premise, and only doing textbook physics it's very unlikely that one realizes that. Philosophy can help and it did for many researchers, including my own teams. We were able to study physical aspects from a non-standard perspective and to come up with new valid theories, mathematically proved and experimentally confirmed, which contradict some theories widely accepted with the difference that the new ones can explain way more than the old ones. From a difficulty perspective, studying physics is significantly harder than studying something like philosophy. Therefore, if you want to approach both aspects, it's safe to say that your will need to invest longer time in the study of physics. Therefore, it would be good to do physics as official study while treating philosophy like a hobby, a way to relax. That's what I'd recommend after more than 20 years of activity in both fields. 

There are also dozens of references of brainwashing and propaganda used on them by the Council Masters, the higher ranks. If you play light side as a Sith Warrior when you encounted them, they will be very amazed that you are not ‘pure evil’ as they were lead / programmed to believe. Many will be left very unbalanced because they are unable to process that you are not actually evil. In their brainwashed minds, The Sith and The Empire equal evil, so doing a good did in front of them will actually cause a lockdown in their brain and they will answer with something like ‘you gave me a lot to keep thinking about’. The conclusion is quite clear: the Jedi have a lot of passion about many things So true detachment, true serenity is more of a philosophical concept rather than something that can be use in practice. Of course, one could argue that a serial killer can be detached and very efficiently kill all it's victims. But the drive to do it comes from a different place. 

Something subjective is something relative while something objective is something universally valid. "prettier" is something subjective by default because there is no universal rule, law or convention to define the specifications for it. "Believes" are also something subjective because they have no actual foundation, therefore it cannot be defined as something objective. Of course, we may take an extreme example of one of the subjects having his face ripped off or something like that, in which case any normal person would say that the other one is prettier, but even in this case there can be perspectives, there can be others even if at a rate of 1 in a million or so that would find the face ripped off subject prettier compared to the other. So not even an extreme example cannot turn the B statement into something objective. 

Free will is your power to be able to have choices, to do what you want when you want and how you want it. It's more like an instinct, not directly related to the level of intelligence. It is not directly related, but that does not mean intelligence is not a contributor factor in the result of one's free will. It is linked to it in another way. Just having free will can lead to nothing practical if you don't have sufficient intelligence. Intelligence helps you act on your free will, allows you to see more possibilities to exert your free will. Practically, higher intelligence offers you more free will choices and, if high enough, it helps you tell the fake choices from the real ones. 

Whenever a truly original genius appears in this world, people immediately try to to get rid of him because of multiple reasons: 

No, an exceptional thing cannot be done without passion (maybe only by accident as an exception). I disagree with another answer's statement that "passion could be viewed as a selfless attachment." No, it cannot. I explained this subject in one of my articles (Star Wars Universe related, you can read it here). ‘There is no passion, there is serenity‘ is a pretty complex matter to study. First of all, what does passion got to do with serenity ? Well, nothing. Doesn’t the lack of passion lead to ignorance ? I think it does. While we can pick now on the exact definition of passion, it is clear that without it you have little to no interest in a subject, therefore you are very likely to ignore it. Jedi seem to consider passion something chaotic instead of what it really is: something that gives you motivation, which is a positive constructive thing. So they view passion as dangerous. Again we can find various contradictions here. Take Anakin as example: passion was one of the main contributors that would lead Anakin to become a Jedi in the first place (just like it happened to many other Jedi), but then he talks about it as being a bad thing: ‘The Sith rely on their passion for their strength. They think inwards, only about themselves’. And after all, isn’t the passion of the Jedi for being Jedi what’s motivating Apprentices to become Knights and then Knights to become Masters in the Order ? Every single Jedi demonstrates a depth of feeling about something at some point. Consider Obi-Wan’s anguished cries after he mutilated Anakin, just as one well known basic example. 

Why compare the possibility of God's existence to something like the Big-Bang assumption ? Both fall under the 'not proved' category. The Big-Bang was formulated due to some scientists being out of ideas and has no true scientific basis. More and more scientists denounce this absurdity. You can assume a big-bang just as you may assume a god. None of them has scientific demonstrations to back it up. The topic should of been formulated as: was matter and life created by an omnipotent entity (i.e. God) or did it appear by itself ? Since we can't prove the God part, let's try to see if the second one is possible. So far, many scientists including me, consider that 2 of 3 steps have been proven. 

Here is another perspective: Considering what happening the world today, if God influences our worldly aspects in any way, it means God is a sadistic psychotic tyrant. Therefore, it cannot be omnibenevolent (since evil does exist in plentiful quantities and usually is the less innocent categories that suffer the most). It is irrelevant how potent it is or not in this dark side scenario or if he is omniscient. There is no fallacy or paradox in this case. Just God having dark fun. 

Why then does (in Phantom Menace) Obi-Wan refers to Jar-Jar Binks as a ‘pathetic life form’ ? Fact is, the Jedi place no value on non-Jedi lives whatsoever. The Jedi systematically prove they really couldn’t care less who they endanger or kill. Just watch the number of actions the Jedi take that might or actually will result in the deaths of non combatants or involve them killing someone in ‘self-defense’ who poses no actual credible threat to them. This is constantly proven by their action starting with endangering civilian lives and ending with the more genocidal actions. Now take a look at this even by them detected Jedi arrogance: Obi-Wan: But he still has much to learn, Master. His abilities have made him… well, arrogant. Yoda: Yes. Yes. A flaw more and more common among Jedi. Too sure of themselves they are. Even the older, more experienced ones. Where’s the Serenity ? Seems to be missing. But there’s plenty of arrogance in the Jedi Order, that’s for sure. 

Let's say you pick an interval of numbers (0-100 or anything else). There are an infinite number of real numbers between 0 and 100. Due to that, the chance that you would randomly pick one of them correctly (let's say you must randomly pick the same one as I did: 64.195831319481958391894832539510313871240[...millions more decimals...]) is zero. However, one of them will surely be picked, so it was not impossible for you to make the pick.
