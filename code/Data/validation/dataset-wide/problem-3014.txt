[This answer is currently incomplete.] I will concentrate on the Christian God, since this is the one that I know best. However, similar comments apply to many other religions and their deities. Hereafter, by "God," I mean the Christian God. To create a case. To create a scientific case that God exists, you would have to perform five basic steps. 

I think part of my mistrust of such religions is my own general mistrust of belief systems that are full of caveats about their own predictions. But, is there any rational basis on which to mistrust such belief systems? 

So this system of axioms is inconsistent with what we actually observe; so, at least one of the givens is incorrect. I think (5) is probably the weakest link. 

Like all basic emotions, hatred is surely an evolutionary adaptation, so it is clearly good for something. In particular, evolutionary theory suggests that genes coding for "never hate" and genes coding for "always hate" probably tend to die out pretty quickly, while more nuanced "hate under these circumstances" genes tend to fare much better. But this is an oversimplification, of course, for example due to pleiotropy. If you want a more philosophical answer, I suggest editing the question to ask "is hatred ever justified?" or some variant thereof. Briefly, my thoughts about this modified question: 

To answer this question most directly, an argument is fallacious when its premises fail to offer sufficient logical support to its conclusion. In the case of what was actually a bad slippery slope argument which came true in spite of its being a bad argument, we might be surprised, but that only shows that improbable events sometimes do happen. The argument has not become a good argument by virtue of the fact that the improbable events it depended on actually happened. It is not a reason for us to change the standards by which we generally evaluate the goodness of arguments. That probably covers it, but if you want to read more about slippery slope arguments and fallacies, then please do: The basic underlying feature of almost all fallacious arguments (I say almost, because in some cases the distinction between the logical and material tasks becomes blurred) is that their premises fail to offer sufficient logical support for their conclusions. One point worth noticing is that it is possible to have a deductive argument, an argument in which the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion, which follows the form of a slippery slope argument. A deductive argument following this form, if it is valid, cannot be a fallacy. Fallacious slippery slope arguments are inductive, rather than deductive. As with their deductive counterpart, each premise is logically dependent on the previous one, but the support is only probabilistic. Since each premise is only probabilistically implied by the previous premise, every premise that is added to an inductive slippery slope argument reduces its logical strength. Think of it as multiplying a series of probabilities. If your first premise offers 95% logical support to the second, and the second premise offers 95% support to the third, then the third is only supported 90.25% since .95 x .95 = .9025. However, this does not show that all inductive slippery slope arguments are automatically fallacious. If there are a small number of premises, and each premise offers strong logical support to the next premise in the series, then we might still think that an argument which has that sort of logical structure can be good. 

I hear many arguments against religion in general, as well as against particular religions. Most of these arguments fall far short of being devastating; however, every so often I encounter an argument that is short, sweet, and very very strong. I'm interested in hearing/reading more such arguments. In particular, they should be: 

Therefore, every fact is worth knowing. Note: this is basically just the interesting number paradox. 

Here's a couple of observations in rapid fire. Have any philosophers argued that these, and other, related observations mean that the Godel incompleteness theorems aren't as devastating as they're often made out to be? Observation one. There's no 'incompleteness theorem for Turing-completeness'. In particular, there's plenty of Turing-complete computational languages. Observation two. Define that the 'diagram of true arithmetic' is the set of all true sentences of the form 

At this point, we're starting to feel discouraged, our eyes are blurring and its hard to function. You burn your toast in the morning, and its too late to try again. Even asking the local waitress for the drink you want ends up being a prolonged struggle, and you keep mis-ordering and having to correct your order. Then when you go to pay her, you drop your change everywhere and the baby nearby nearly eats it, and you just feel really bad about the whole thing. In practice, this is how you realize that its time to give up on this particular plan of attack. Perhaps its time to create a whole new case for the existence of God based on explaining an altogether different set of phenomena. In any event, you're done! But. Just for the sake of argument. Lets pretend that contrary to everything I've just said, we actually find that prayer does work; more precisely, that the effect is so large, that neither publication bias nor poorly controlled experiments nor scientific corruption can explain it. Hallelujah! Prayer works! Its a miracle! But, as it turns out, our celebration was incredibly premature. To be continued... 

There may be some who disagree with me, but I take it to be true that knowledge is, to some degree, intrinsically hierarchical (the question in the title here is genuine though, if you don't think it is, persuade me it's not!) This is just to say that there are some things which cannot be known until other things before them are known. Understanding of some concepts cannot be achieved without first having understood others. In my view, this implies hierarchy. I also take it as a general truth of Human society that in the vast majority of possible worlds, we are better off with a society that has more knowledge than a society that has less knowledge. Human beings enter the world as babies without any knowledge, aside from basic sensory data, if that can be construed as knowledge. This implies that there are always going to be some individuals who have less knowledge than others. If our society values knowledge, as I think it should, then because of the intrinsically hierarchical nature of knowledge, those who have more knowledge are in a position of authority relative to those who have less. Many people understand anarchy to be the absence of hierarchy (as opposed to the common 'folk' view of anarchy, which often suggests that anarchy means either chaos, or an absence of order, both of which I disagree with). If this view on anarchy (absence of hierarchy, but not necessarily absence of order) is correct, then is valuing knowledge thus incompatible with anarchy? Can the two be reconciled? 

More precisely, I guess I should be writing SSS(0)+SS(0)=SSSSS(0). Anyway, the point is, the diagram of true arithmetic is recursively ennumerable. Indeed, it is recursive, a more stringent condition. For example, we can decide whether 3+2=5 or not. This means that, for example, that if we axiomatized arithmetic in a highly defective (but internally consistent) manner - say, for example, we ended up proving 438+21=555, or something like that - well we can demonstrate the our axiomatization is defective by noting that 'not 438+21=555' is an element of the diagram of true arithmetic. 

? Furthermore, I'm interested in normative theories of morality that are designed to help adherents improve their genetical success by means of doing the right thing. 

[This question needs a major rewrite. Please regard it as 'paused' and inactive until I find the time to clarify the issues of concern. Thank you.] Suppose we want to write very rigorous mathematics. Then, we need a foundation. Now the naive approach is to just formalize everything within this foundation. Like, if our foundation is ZFC, then a group is an ordered pair (G,*), encoded as Kuratowski pair or otherwise, and formally speaking * is really a subset of G^3. By defining things in this very rigorous way, we might think that a high level of rigor is thereby achieved. Actually, this is a really bad way of going about it! It means that if our foundations turns out to be inconsistent, then nothing we've proved in this way (say, about groups) can be trusted anymore. We have to start again from scratch. In reality, of course, we wouldn't need to start again from scratch, because most of the stuff we've proved doesn't need the full power of our foundations after all. For instance, if we're using ZFC as our foundations, well perhaps only 3 out of the 50 theorems we've proved need anything approaching the full power of ZFC, with the other results either following directly from the group axioms, or else being provable in much weaker systems. Thus, in general, we want to prove things under minimal foundational assumptions, as opposed to committing to one particular foundations and carrying out all our activity therein. This raises an interesting question. If foundational theories like ZFC are not the right place to formalize definitions like group, field, topological space, etc., then what is the proper role of foundations in rigorous mathematics?
