(My emphasis) The abstract can be found here: $URL$ In addition, this should be a basic physics question: The severity of head injuries clearly depends on the force of the impact. If that force is reduced in any way, this will mean less severe injuries. In a way, this question is similar to the question if there are studies regarding the usefulness of parachutes... EDIT There was the added question of increased odds of accident when wearing a helmet. This is the theory of risk homeostasis. According to that theory, each individual has a personal target level for the risk it takes. If safety measures reduce the risk, behavior is adapted to bring it to the higher level again. A discussion of this effect regarding bicycle helmets is found here: $URL$ However, there is apparently no consensus and no study regarding the specific question of risk homeostasis for bicycle helmets. Subsequent studies proved to be inconclusive as well, and there are many more effects to take into account. 

There's a current scare going around FB that now that it wants to make some actual money, they'll start using profile pics and other things uploaded to facebook in advertisements. Here is an example of the messages that get sent around: 

It is freely available on the web: $URL$ They have a nice summary of the current state of affairs. While contagious yawning is known to occur in some species, the reason for it is still not understood. There are several hypotheses to explain contagious yawning in humans, and each hypothesis makes a different prediction for what other animals should experience contagious yawning: 

A while ago, someone studying a health related subject (not necessarily medicine, but I forgot) claimed that "real" allergies could only be caused by protein-like substances. I was told this after I claimed I was allergic to kiwi fruit, which I then was told wasn't possible. Are there in medicine some subtle definitions that differentiate between allergies in that narrow sense, and, maybe, "intolerances" of a broader sense? 

I have heard on some occasions that programs for digital media, such as Adobe Photoshop, embed hidden watermarks in the pictures that make it possible to spot a pirated copy and trace it to the person using that copy. This point typically comes up in discussions "GIMP vs Photoshop" which begin by someone mentioning that GIMP is free, which gets the response that Photoshop could be pirated, which is then shot down by the "they're gonna catch you via the watermarks" answer. It seems plausible to me that this can be done at the technical level, but is it really used in the industry to find and persecute software pirates? 

I cannot further substantiate what "keeping your brain active" means because the sources I give also don't really substantiate it. But maybe there is some scientific research that is more specific. 

Virtually all food contains carbohydrates, so every type of food will contribute to tooth decay if dental hygiene is not applied properly. However, the more sugar the food contains, the more the bacteria flourish and damage your teeth, as explained on that website. If you apply proper dental hygiene, then eating sweets should not be a problem. The trouble is that sweets are usually consumed as snacks between meals and thus a long time passes until teeth are brushed, allowing more time for tooth decay. 

Well, there is hard science behind the fact that water comes in various degrees of hardness/softness depending on how much Calcium and Magnesium are in the water. In the same way that Dripstone caves form, hard water can (and will) leave deposits of calcium and magnesium compounds in your appliances (Limescale). From that article: 

Aim of the study was to find an animal that does not show empathy or non-social mimicry and see if that species showed contagious yawning. If so, it would support the first hypothesis, if not, it would rule it out. The result of their paper: 

EDIT: I just found this image: It allows immediate switching by looking at either the left or the right instance. 

There are some (in)famous experiments done by Rupert Sheldrake who claims that a so-called "morphogenetic" field is responsible for this sort of thing. Alas, his experiments had quite sloppy methodology. The feeling itself is real, as most here will testify. But it has nothing to do with being actually stared at/observed. $URL$ Apart from some technical problems with Sheldrake's experiment, here is a partial explanation for why some people really believe they can feel when they are stared at: 

Another superb example of science reporters doing a terrible job. Yes, there is some indication that dichloroacetate has some effects on cancer but so far there have been no clinical studies on humans. An important thing to note: Cancer is not a disease. Cancer is a super-class of a multitude of different diseases. Some cancers are malign, some are benign, some metastasize heavily, some don't. Some can be "cured" with chemotherapy, some with radiation, some not really at all. Some are caused by viruses, some by currently unknown effects. And for the same reason that cancer is not a single disease, there will not be a single cure. A very thorough overview of the research, and how it got mangled in the reporting process, is given by PZ Myers: Pharyngula Blog: Dichloroacetate and cancer. The gist: 

While at first it might seem obvious that women who dress provocatively "ask for it", this is not true. It is a poor excuse. In her dissertation for the degree of MSc, Sophia Shaw found: 

One hears it once in a while that many allergies are due to people overly concerned with hygiene. The rationale is that growing up in a near-sterile environment will leave your immune system confused so that you then develop allergies. Is this actually true? 

There's quite an exhaustive takedown of this claim by biologist P.Z. Myers on his blog Pharyungula. The paper he relies on is 

So yeah, since there is not the one pill, results differ among these. The risk is only marginally significant, which means that if one throws levonorgestrel out of the mix, the risk will probably not be significant any more. Reference: $URL$ 

My mother just told me about the highly sensitive person test. I'm skeptical to what this scale can actually tell about me, if it is scientifically accurate and used by other academics as well. The homepage claims: 

I wonder: Is there empirical research behind this, is being a highly sensitive person a "real" medical condition and if so, can a simple test where I answer questions about myself determine if I have this condition? 

The question of airplane safety is a nice field to demonstrate the old quip that you shouldn't trust any statistic you haven't forged yourself. It is crucial to define exactly what you mean by safe, and what you are comparing: Are you interested in total deaths per year? Then the car is the most dangerous and, depending on the country you are looking at, trains are the least dangerous, with airplanes also quite safe: 

He continues to give a very simple example explaining the idea behind hormesis, before coming to his damning conclusion: 

Not long ago there was an intense debate in Germany over early childcare, with conservatives advocating incentives for mothers to stay at home and progressives advocating for improving early childcare so mothers could continue their careers without too much disruption. The advocates of housewife-mothers claimed that children given into early childcare (at the age of three) would later experience problems in their emotional development as a fixed person to relate to would be missing from them. I am quite skeptical of this claim as other countries (Denmark, Sweden, Norway) have quite an intensive early childcare system and I cannot imagine that all their children are troubled. Have there any studies been done on this question? EDIT I see that this might be a bit broad and depends both on the parents as well as on the daycare. So let us make some of the parameters equal and suppose that the parents and the childcare educators are both just as qualified in terms of education. Is it then problematic that the child in a childcare center has not a single reference person, i.e. today it's Alice, tomorrow it's Bob etc.? This was argued by the conservative part. 

This partly answers the question. There are multiple differing claims here, but the thing regarding attention spans seems to be validated by the Stanford research. 

But in terms of mind control, the patent does not do anything to support a claim regarding whether or not they can make you do what they want, or feel what they want. If it was indeed possible, then googling for "electromagnetic mind control" should turn up some research papers and not just a bunch of New World Order 911 blogs. Emotions are way more complicated than "resonances" of "brain circuits". There's a bunch of other stuff going on as well. Hormones play a big role, for example. Finally: Different TVs will have different electromagnetic signatures, and it'd be next to impossible to get the correct output on all devices embedded in the TV signal. And that's not even accounting for the fact that modern TVs have a much lower EM radiation footprints. So in conclusion: The patent claims something that it can't deliver on. It's pretty old by now, so we should have been able to see it come to fruition if it would actually work. I mean, if there's a patent, that means the way it works is out in the open. Nothing would stop anyone from building and using such a thing. It combines the correct claim that in-brain EM stimulation can alter behaviour with the correct claim that cell phones and TVs give off EM radiation to arrive at the false claim that you can use the EM radiation from TV or cell phone to alter someone's emotions. 

However, the magnetic fields in an MRI device are incredibly high compared to what your TV, microwave, cellphone can put out. That's why you have to remove all metal prior to having an MRI scan done. EM radiation can "mess" with your brain though: $URL$ 

There's a bunch of claims and half-truths combined with some misapplied truths. First: Yes, electromagnetic waves can influence the nervous system. There are, for example, highly experimental treatments of Parkinson's and Tourette's using little electric pulse-givers embedded into the brain: $URL$ In addition: $URL$ That article has a lot of good examples for how EM radiation can affect the brain. From that article: 

What I did was enter "cancer contraceptive meta" into the Google Scholar search engine. There are various disagreeing results. One of the more recent meta studies concludes: 

I used to visit the link above a couple of times. Each time, the initial direction of spinning was different. The reason is that the image is, in reality, a 2D image shifting back and forth. According to this source, our brain has not evolved to deal with 2D images, so it takes clues from the image to reconstruct a 3D model. This happens in the Visual Cortex. It will scramble along and try to make sense of what it sees. Either direction of rotation works, so whatever is found first, it will stick. Unless you refocus and give your visual cortex a chance to come to a different conclusion. Here a quote from the source: 

There are two claims astrologers make. First, that they can use it to predict the future: Google Second, that your zodiac sign and date of birth tell something about your character. The first claim is so inane that I do not think it needs much debunking. It is a mixture of self-fulfilling prophecies and overly vague statements. And, more often than not, it simply fails. Shouldn't astrologers otherwise be able to foresee natural disasters with astonishing precision? It is noteworthy that a lot of astrologers adhering to the second claim shun the first claim in an attempt to strengthen their credibility. The second claim is easily debunked in experiment: Here is Derren Brown doing a nice little experiment: $URL$ In brief: He writes "personal readings" for his test subjects and asks them to rate the accuracy of these readings. His readings get extremely high accuracy ratings (80 - 100 %), but it turns out that he has provided everyone with exactly the same reading. This is because he uses so called Barnum statements, also called the Forer effect (The Wikipedia article has a link to the original work by Forer). 

Evolution itself is a fact; the theory part is the mechanism behind it all. Every trait you see in a living being has had to evolve. Therefore, it is only natural that every trait has an evolutionary explanation. See, e.g., here: $URL$ The example you bring makes an attempt at ridiculing evolution, with the rationale being "Since it explains both cooperation and fighting, clearly it is wrong or just arbitrary". That is a fallacy. We don't cooperate and fight at the same time. The same humans that cooperated in hunting down a mammoth would later fight for a female, or for clan leadership. So what? The claim that evolutionary explanations are "just so stories" is also taken up at talkorigins here: $URL$ Also, evolution cannot explain every traits. Only those that we observe in the real world. If we'd found rabbits in the precambrian, for example, we'd immediately know that we've got something wrong concerning the origin of species. See here: $URL$ Evolution also would be unable to explain traits that are so destructive and detrimental that they cannot be remedied or outweighed by other traits. But it is quite obvious that a species with these traits would go extinct in a very short time. So again, evolution is consistent here in that it can tell us why we see certain traits, and why we don't see certain others. Like the exploding Swamp Dragons in Terry Pratchet's Discworld universe... 

If I recall correctly, Vitamin C plays an important role in the body's immune system. Anecdotal testing by myself gave me the impression that I could ward off a developing cold by the intake of high doses of Vitamin C. In a pharmacy, I've now come across "Ester-C", claiming to be a reaction product of the ascorbic acid and something else. It was marketed as "the better Vitamin C", because it was alleged that it was better absorbed by the body, and better tolerated than the acid itself. Now, as good and important Vitamin C might be, there's a lot of hyper around vitamin supplements, so I'm skeptical about these claims. Here my question: Does Ester C have the same health benefits as common vitamin C (ascorbic acid) and, in addition, is it better tolerated and absorbed?
