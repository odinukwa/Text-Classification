My current company pays for my education, and I'm currently pursuing my master's. However, some parts of my job (which are non-negotiable required functions) require me to travel which has taken a toll on my grades, and is getting worse as time goes on. That being said, I'm looking for a new job. Part of the deal with my employer paying for tuition is that if I leave within a year of when they've paid money for school, I have to pay them back. Unfortunately right now that's about $12K, money I don't just have readily available. One of my requirements for a new company is that they also offer tuition assistance. That being said, I'm not sure how to bring up that I need financial assistance in order to leave my current job and join a new company, and especially because it's related to tuition (which the new company will reimburse). 

If you think you lack the experience for the position then you're not going to get it. That's not the mindset you want to be going into an interview with. Just because you're out of school and not going to College doesn't mean you lack the education to be a software developer. Have you got any experience in the languages you are applying for or are you applying for entry level positions that don't expect you to know the language? This question makes a difference. If they don't expect you to know the language, then education isn't a massive factor in terms of the language. Your school grades will count but what will count more is how you think, do you have a logical approach to solutions, do you know any similar language? That's more important in a prospective entry level position where they are going to teach you. You need to show that you are receptive, eager to learn and most importantly, capable of learning. If you're going for a position where you are expected to know the language, again you don't have to have a college degree, but you will have to demonstrate command of the language. Do you have code samples you can show them? Build a portfolio, even a small one, of sample programs and code you've written. Have you worked on open source initiatives? Great, show them you've contributed; this is all experience. Not everything has to be about your school work for a school leaver. 

Basically, I feel like I've made a poor decision in my job choice and I want to change jobs. Now. However, I can definitely see this being seen as a bad thing in interviews - so my question really comes down to: How do I explain to interviewers why I want to leave this position? 

I currently live in Philadelphia PA and today I was contacted by a recruiter asking me if I'd be interested in talking about jobs in the area. I am currently looking for a new position, but I'm looking in Seattle and I told him so. His response was a 'oh well, thanks anyway' and then he added that I should include this on my resume (to deter local people from contacting me). Is this good advice? If yes, how should I put it on my resume? I don't want my current employer to come across it and be tipped off that I'm looking for a new position 

I'd make it polite and to the point, thanking them for the opportunities that they have offered you. Make sure to leave professionally. I find this a helpful template: 

What do you think appraisals are for? To praise a good job? Or to get you to look at yourself, identify areas that need working on, or that have improved over the project and set goals for your next appraisal? You say your manager is asking questions that seek confessions of mistakes. I say you're looking at appraisals in the wrong way. Your manager is in fact asking you to look at yourself honestly, to identify what you did well, but also identify any areas that you need to improve on. Nobody is perfect, everyone makes mistakes, that's part of life. Your manager isn't expecting you to get everything 100% right, but when you do make a mistake you're expected to analyse it and learn from it. If you can show that by explaining what you did wrong, why it was wrong, what you learnt from the mistake and what you are going to do in the future to stop yourself from making that mistake again then your manager should be happy with your progress. In answer to your question, you shouldn't try to avoid ratting yourself out as you put it. If your manager is paying enough attention it's likely they already know about your mistake. If a member of my staff skirted round an issue, or didn't admit to an error I knew about in an appraisal meeting with me then that would raise trust issues. I would start to doubt their word and their ability to be honest with me, and that's a much bigger issue than them making a mistake. 

I've been in my current position about 2.5 months The position is a software development position, but my degree is not in software development (industrial engineering). I thought I wanted to get into software development, but I find now that I'd much rather deal with the systems behind it (i.e. if I were to pick a new job today I'd be a junior Linux sysadmin or developer for a startup) While I would enjoy development, I'm really just not liking the work this company does (my company customizes clunky pre-made software for customers, whereas I'd rather build software from the ground up if in a dev position) 

There's absolutely nothing wrong with applying for both positions. Just make it clear when applying for the second you've applied for the first and let them know the status of your application. As it stands now it's probably in your best interest to make the manager of the second lab aware of your first interview with the company. As they've emailed you giving you an update on the status of the position (working with HR) I'd send a reply back just clearly stating the situation. That way you're covered by having informed them as much as you can. 

As with most things in the professional world, honestly and politely. It seems you feel bad for the other firm for all the work they've put in trying to get you. My advise to you is stay detached in these situations; don't feel guilty about having to turn down the job no matter what they've done for you. You have to do what is right for you, just as the company will do what is right for it. You don't have to tell them you have another offer that is better if you don't want to. You can simply tell them that you no longer wish to pursue their offer. You can of course tell them you need more time to consider and put them off a little to make sure you definitely get the local job, and if that falls through go with the foreign one. But once you have the local job secured, just be straight up with the foreign company. Thank them for the offer but tell them after all considerations you've decided not to take their offer. They'll probably ask why and it's at that point you can either say "I'd prefer not to answer that." or "I've taken a different job more local to me.". Whichever you choose, remember not answering them is more preferable to lying to them. Just stay honest with them and you should be fine. 

Relatively new to working in a professional/office environment. I've been worried about making sure that I try my hardest to stay on task. However, when I look behind me one of my co workers is constantly on facebook, reading articles, etc. He does, however, get his work done well and I can't tell for sure exactly how much time he spends working vs. other things. I know that few managers expect their employees to work 40 hours per week where 100% of the time is actually spent on working, however I'm sure that there's some percentage of that time they expect you to be working... Is there a general 'range' for what managers expect (75-90% vs 50-70%) or is it all 100% dependent on the manager in question? FWIW I work in a software engineering position.
