Are a significant number of tinnitus sufferers helped - even if only temporarily - by this technique? 

Some sports people wear "eye black" (black strips on the upper cheek) under glare conditions (sun or stadium lights) to reduce glare. For example, one brand claims it is: 

Let's see if I can get my high school maths right. With simple interest, the formula is simple. If you borrow $100, at 6% per annum simple interest for half of a year, you must pay back: 

No. No, it wouldn't. If this had any real chance of being true, the potential impact on human health would be great - I am sure Ethics Committees would approve invasive steps to depurr some cats, if such a process was possible. They claim that "the scientific version of this paper has been submitted for review". I would have expected this process to have finished after 6 years (or 11 years after it was first presented at the 2001, 142nd annual Acoustical Society of America, American Institute of Physics, International Conference). They are also appealing for help and money to further the research. So where did we get? We have some studies that show vibrations may help some healing, we have a study that show cats purr, we have a ten-year-old wild conjecture that cats purr to help healing, and we have some appeals for money. I think in conclusion, we can say that this claim has not been proven. 

Certainly the source country is irrelevant for health effects. It is only relevant to trigger emotive patriotic and political concerns. Similarly, it doesn't matter how the information was obtained - citing "Freedom of Information" strikes an emotive chord that the government may be trying to otherwise hide something. I would like to see a cite of the request and the resulting data, to ensure we aren't being exploited by people putting in FoI requests where a regular request (or even web search!) would get the same information. 

In conclusion, it's time to find a new dietitian, and to consider complaining about the current one to their licensing body. 

In the case of Randi's trick, I do not know how he did it, and if I did, I would not tell you. Given I don't know, and I am only guessing wildly, I don't mind sharing my thoughts: he spent more time than he needed to explaining that the gave the volunteer his pen and his magazine, and IIRC, that he took the magazine back afterwards. This suggests to me he may have had a mechanism for determining the chosen word. Historically, I have been frequently wrong at guessing the mechanism of tricks, so this is wild speculation. 

The links you provide contain many ridiculous claims that need separate questions to address individually. However, they also contain counter-evidence to the overarching claim. 

New South Wales The NSW Department of Education has the Crown Employees (Teachers in Schools and Related Employeers) Salaries and Conditions Award 2014 However, there isn't a simple count of the number of hours in this document - it is based on 28 x 40 minute teaching periods per week in high schools, plus additional alternate periods, and non-teaching time. I am loathe to do original research to compute the hours; there is a lot of complexity here. 

Does aspirin reduce risk of Alzheimer's disease? The jury is still out. This paper found that aspirin may help: 

touching bananas connected to hardware? pushing buttons on a wireless device in the shape of a wand? detecting when you raise your eyebrows, using a device that sits on your head? 

It is a reasonable for Rivest to give a loose estimate of at least a decade for a robust national identification scheme to be introduced into the United States, especially given the political pushback it is likely to cause (for example: Australia Card was a similar proposal.) I do not believe this is the only limitation against secure Internet voting, but it suffices for this answer. (Rivest includes other reasons in, for example, his slides Thoughts On Appropriate Technologies for Voting, including that Internet voting isn't trust-worthy enough to convince losers they really lost, they can't guarantee secret ballots, they can't prove a chain of custody, real software is likely to contain security flaws, they are at risk of insider attacks, etc.) 

The actual study that was performed is largely irrelevant here. What is interesting is the literature search in the Introduction: 

So both sites, with limited rigour, suggest that yes, eating celery burns more calories than it provides. 

No, twins do not have any special magical powers, despite a number of studies investigating the claim. A lightweight study was done in 1993 to examine if identical twins tended to have similarities in thinking, independent of any Extrasensory Perception (ESP). 

No According to the BBC, in October 2010, Michael Elliot was paid £3,001,511 for a £2 stake in the football pools. Football pools is a betting system based on predicting the (partial) outcome of 10-12 games of football (a.k.a. soccer). These are equivalent to odds just over 1.5 million to 1. There may be even larger payouts, but this is enough to demonstrate the claim is incorrect. 

Each pixel records the sum of all the light from the objects that fit within the area covered by that pixel. If some small fraction of that area is very bright, then it will contribute more than its fair share to the sum of the light covered by that pixel and make the whole pixel appear brighter. In this way, a small item 0.12 of a pixel across can make the whole pixel be bright - but not as bright as if it took up the whole area covered by the pixel. (I am going to be pinged for not providing references again, but this just comes from an understanding of digital photography.) 

This INE document describes the process, including a step of receiving a voucher with a date on it. After than date, you must return to the same office, present the voucher and have your fingerprint verified to receive the card. (My Spanish is poor, so I would appreciate some verification that I have this right.) 

They find the high contaminated lettuces had less microflora on them when washed in the produce wash with water. 

Let's start with the easy part: How many priests are there in Australia? The ABS reported in 1994 that there were 2,005. Catholic Australia have a web-site that claims there were 3,085 in 2009, and that it has generally been dropping. It includes at least 495 retired priests in that number - maybe more. It references "Official Directory of the Catholic Church in Australia 2009-2010, pp.735". That is a large difference, and it is difficult to see how to reconcile these figures. It may be a matter of definitions (e.g. whether to include retirees) or one or both being inaccurate. The figure of "around 3000 Catholic priests in Australia, plus a few hundred retirees" seems to on the high side, given retirees are counted separately, but it isn't a gross exaggeration, especially given the rubberiness of the figures. 

Typically, these "50% genetic" claims are misleading simplifications of the longer claim: "50% of the variance in the population can be explained by genetic differences." It is a measure of how accurate a statistical model could be, if it only considered one factor. That appear to be how it is intended here. The 50% figure seems to have been popularised in a book The How of Happiness by Dr Sonja Yubomirksy, a professor at the University of California. This conclusion was drawn in her 2005 paper, Pursuing Happiness: The Architecture of Sustainable Change (with co-authors, Kennon M. Sheldon and David Schkade): 

No. In the 2002 paper, Evolutionary and Historical Aspects of the Burden of Malaria [DOI: 10.1128/CMR.15.4.564–594.2002] the authors look at the history of malaria all the way back to pre-agricultural times. They explain how bad malaria was at its worst point: 

Clearly, in LCD technology terms, 2002 is a long time ago. I have no knowledge of any power-saving innovations in the meantime. 

Note that when Mortenson was alive, the claim would have Mûrasi as being living and older than Mortensen. Their Twitter account confirms this. 

A third of 155 is 51.67 - hence the statement implies that there are 51 or fewer hospitals. Wikipedia provides a list of hospitals in Denmark. By my count, there are 89 in the list. 89 is more than 51. 89 is 57% of 155. If there really were 155 hospitals at some point (which I haven't confirmed) a more accurate statement would be "they have reduced that by more than a third today." Potential sources of error in this analysis include: 

(Wikipeda confirms that a BMW 525i E34 has a curb-weight of 1.5 tonnes, although it may vary by model and by what was in the car.) 

In short, the factoid is based on genuine science, but drawing a firm conclusion would require further evidence. Two minor points: (1) The study found the Odds Ratio (OR) was 5.8, not 6, as reported in the snippet. (2) After reading the author list I really wanted to meet the researcher with the spectacular name Merle Hamburger. Alas, he passed away in 2011. 

They did not explicitly mention dentists, which I interpret to mean there is no unusual association that needed mentioning when discussing the topic of occupational risk. Thus, it would be expected that Australian dentists have a low suicide risk. I think it is safe to assume that suicide profiles in Australia are similar to other countries. 

In his ruling, in United States of America against Lawrence Dicristina, he explains the evidence from the prosecution and defendant, who both agreed that poker has a significant amount of skill and a significant amount of chance. They agreed that the top players would eventually tend to come out ahead. They differed as to how many would be ahead (e.g. if you were slightly better than another player, you may eventually do better than them, but still lose out due to the "rake"). They differed as to how long it would take to get ahead, and how long should be considered relevant. (Should the fact that a single hand is predominantly chance be considered, or the fact that after several dozens of hours played, the game is predominantly skill?) The judge quotes precedence that
