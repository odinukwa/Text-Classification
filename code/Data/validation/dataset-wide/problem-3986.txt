The answer is that a point $p$ can participate in $5k$ circles. The construction demonstrating that $p$ can be in $5k$ circles (that is, it can be the 5-th nearest neighbor to $5k$ other points) is as follows: Place $p$ at the center of a regular pentagon of side length $L$. Place $q_1$ at one of the vertices; draw a circle $C_1$ centered at $q_1$ with radius $r_1 = d(p,q_1) + \epsilon_1$ (for some small positive $\epsilon_1$). Now mark the point $t_1$ on the line from $p$ to $q_1$ such that $d(p,t_1) = L$. And place $k-1$ points $\{ s_{11}, s_{12}\ldots\}$ along the line from $q_1$ to $p$ such that $$d(q_1, s_{1m}) = 2^{-m}(d(q_1,p)-\epsilon_1) $$ and commit to placing no other points inside $C_1$. Then for all $m, j < k$, $$d(s_1m,s_1j) < d(p, s_1m) \mbox{ and } d(q_1,s_1m,) < d(p, s_1m). $$ Thus (since we will not put any other points inside $C_1$) $p$ is the $k$-th nearest neighbor to each of the $k$ points $\{q_1, s_{11}, s_{12} \ldots \}$. Now place $q_2$ at a neighboring vertex of the pentagon, and construct $C_2$ centered at $q_2$ with radius $r_2 = d(p,q_2) + \epsilon_2$. While the line from $q_2$ to $p$ does intersect with the interior of $C_1$, the part of that line starting at $q_2$ and extending to length $\frac12 (d(p,q_2)-L)$ does not intersect $C_1$. Thus all the $s_{2m}$ are farther from all the $s_{1m}$ than they are from each other or from $p$ or $q_1$, and by the same argument as before, $p$ is the $k$-th nearest neighbor to each of the $k$ points $\{q_2, s_{21}, s_{22} \ldots \}$. Proceed in this fashion to place all five $q_j$, and you have constructed $p$ to be the $k$th nearest neighbor to each of $5k$ other points. Now, can we place $q$ to be the $k$-th nearest neighbor to at least $5k+1$ other points? The same reasoning that prevents (without allowing ties) a point from being the nearest neighbor to $6$ other points also prevents tightening the angular distances between the groups of $s_{1m}$ and $s_{2m}$, and we obviously could add no additional points on the line segments without dropping one of the $q_i$ from the list of points having $p$ as a $k$-th nearest neighbor. So the only approach to increasing the number would be to stagger the $s_{im}$ in angle, to try to make room for another point. I have a rather long and ugly proof that for $k=2$ you cannot be the second nearest neighbor to more than $10$ other points. The underlying reason is again that a (convex) hexagon must contain two points that are closer together than the distance between one of those points and a specified point in the interior. But I can't seem to handle the general case for $k>2$. 

Every differential geometer should read at least the first two volumes of Spivak's A Comprehensive Introduction to Differential Geometry. In particular, volume 2 is an absolute gem. Not only does it reprint (translations of) original papers by Gauss and Riemann, complete with very enlightening notes and commentary, but (if I remember correctly) Spivak presents about 5 or 6 different proofs that a Riemannian manifold is flat if and only if it is locally isometric to Euclidean space. This gives the reader the best, most intuitive grasp of the concept of curvature that I have seen anywhere. (I am a firm believer in learning by repetition...) 

José is correct, with the caveat that Gunnar mentioned - you need simple-connectedness to know that reduced holonomy = holonomy. Below I expand a bit more on the details. [Thanks to Tim Perutz for catching errors in the initial version of this answer.] Notice that the OP did not ask for $\Omega$ to be parallel or even closed. The following is true: If $(M, J, g, \omega)$ is Ricci-flat Kaehler, then the image of the first Chern class $c_1 (M)$in $H^2 (M, \mathbb R)$ vanishes, so that if $\pi_1(M) = 0$, then $H^2(M, \mathbb Z)$ has no torsion, and thus the canonical bundle $\Lambda^{n, 0} (M)$ is topologically trivial. So there exists a nowhere vanishing smooth $(n,0)$-form $\Omega$ that trivializes the canonical bundle. By consideration of type, $\Omega \wedge \overline \Omega$ is a nonvanishing $(n,n)$-form, so by rescaling $\Omega$ by a nowhere vanishing complex valued function, one gets for "free" the identity that $$ \frac{\omega^n}{n!} = (-1)^{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}} \Omega \wedge \overline \Omega.$$ Since $\Omega$ is type $(n,0)$ and the complex structure is integrable, then $\Omega$ will be holomorphic (and thus the canonical bundle is holomorphically trivial) if and only if it is closed. Since $M$ is Ricci-flat, the Bochner theorem tells you that an $(n,0)$ form is closed if and only if it is parallel, which would give you holonomy contained in $SU(n)$. Compactness is needed to go the other way: Yau's theorem says that if $M$ is compact Kaehler and $c_1 (M) = 0$, then there exists a unique Ricci flat Kaehler metric in each Kaehler class. There are noncompact examples where uniqueness fails. I don't know as much as I should about the literature on existence in the noncompact case, but the papers of Tian-Yau should have the answer. A good elementary reference is Chapter 6 of Compact Manifolds with Special Holonomy by Dominic Joyce. 

As to variant (A), it of course (at least in two dimensions) will a.s. become trapped for large $t$, so it is not immediately obvious that $d_A(t)$ grows even as fast as $d_0(t)$. 

When removing vertex $v$ by slicing by an $n-1$ dimensional plane $S$ in such a way that no other vertex is sliced off, every facet that includes $v$ transforms to a facet with an additional boundary component, but that is still just one facet. And the intersection of the plane $S$ with the original polyhedron is the boundary of one additional facet, lying in $S$. Therefore, the upper bound is $k+1$ facets. This upper bound is always saturated unless $S$ slices through some vertiex or vertices other than $v$. For example, in a cube, if you slice off a little triangle near to one corner you are left with $6+1=7$ facets, one of which is a triangle, three pentagons, and three squares. But if the slice passes through the three vertices connected by an edge to that corner, the facets go down to $4$, three triangles and a quadrilateral. However, in the last paragraph of the problem it becomes clear that this is not what the OP means, because he speaks of a polyhedron with $V-1$ vertices, and teh polyhedra formed by plane slicing have, in may cases, more than $V$ vertices. (For example, the cube with a corner nipped has ten vertices.) If you are restricted to lopping of a vertex such that no new vertices are created, then the most remaining facets are achieved when the slicing loses every facet attached to $v$ and gains the single new facet. Now in $n$ dimensions each vertex intersects with at least $n$ facets. So the upper bound, achieved when slicing off a vertex that is in with just $n$ facets in such a way that the slicer goes through edges only at other vertices, is $k-n+1$. Obviously, for a generic polyhedron, it may or may not be possible to slice off a specific vertex without creating new vertices, so this upper bound is not always achievable. 

This answer is an attempt to slightly rephrase Ilya's argument; I would have written it as a comment, but there's not enough room. Given a path $\gamma$ with endpoints $v_0$ and $v_n$, we have a 1-chain $c(\gamma)$, which is an integer-linear combination of edges of the graph. Let $E_{c(\gamma)}$ be the set of edges with non-zero coefficients in $c(\gamma)$; this need not include every edge that appears in the path, since some might cancel to zero in the 1-chain. If we think of these edges as decorated with the integer coefficients they inherit from the 1-chain $c(\gamma)$, we can associate a 1-chain with any subset of $E_{c(\gamma)}$. It's possible that $E_{c(\gamma)}$ as a subgraph of $\Gamma$ contains several connected components that share no vertices with each other, but since the boundary of $c(\gamma)$ is only non-zero on $v_0$ and $v_n$, and it's impossible for a 1-chain to have a single-point boundary, these components would need to include exactly one whose 1-chain's boundary was non-zero on $v_0$ and $v_n$, and all the rest would have to give 1-cycles. Since they're all disjoint, any one of the 1-cycles $\chi$ would satisfy $\langle c(\gamma), \chi \rangle = \langle \chi, \chi \rangle \gt 0$. Assuming now that $E_{c(\gamma)}$ is connected as a subgraph, we can build up a 1-chain $\sigma$ with a positive inner product with $c(\gamma)$ as follows. Starting at $v_0$, pick an edge $\epsilon_1$ incident on $v_0$, and put $\pm \epsilon_1$ in $\sigma$, with the sign chosen to be the same as the coefficient of $\epsilon_1$ in $c(\gamma)$. Then advance to the other vertex of $\epsilon_1$, and choose an edge $\epsilon_2$ such that $\epsilon_2 \ne \epsilon_1$, and $\pm \epsilon_2$ with the same sign as the coefficient of $\epsilon_2$ in $c(\gamma)$ gives a boundary for $\pm \epsilon_1 \pm \epsilon_2$ that is zero at the current vertex. This must be possible (assuming we haven't ended up at an endpoint of the path), since the boundary of $c(\gamma)$ is zero at the current vertex, so the signs of the edge coefficients in $c(\gamma)$ can't all give boundaries of the same sign here. We continue this process until we reach either $v_n$, the endpoint of the path, or a vertex we've visited before. If we reach a vertex we've visited before, we can drop any earlier edges from $\sigma$ and obtain a 1-cycle with a positive inner product with $c(\gamma)$. If we reach $v_n$, there are two possibilities. If $\sigma = c(\gamma)$ then $\sigma$ describes a simple path $\gamma'$ from $v_0$ to $v_n$ with the same 1-chain as our original path, and we can proceed to use that simple path in place of $\gamma$. If $\sigma \ne c(\gamma)$, it nonethless has the same boundary. Since $\sigma$ is supported on a subset of the same edges as $c(\gamma)$, and its coefficients are of the same sign but never greater in magnitude (and must be less on at least one edge), $\langle c(\gamma), \sigma \rangle$ will be strictly less than $\langle c(\gamma), c(\gamma) \rangle$. So we'll have a non-trivial 1-cycle $\ell = c(\gamma) - \sigma$, and: $$\langle c(\gamma), \ell \rangle = \langle c(\gamma), c(\gamma) \rangle - \langle c(\gamma), \sigma \rangle \gt 0$$ Finally, suppose we have a simple path $\gamma': v_0 \to v_1 \to \dots \to v_n$ with the same 1-chain as $\gamma$. (The following refinement of Ilya's argument is something that John described to me in correspondence.) Since the edge $e_n: v_{n-1} \to v_n$ cannot be a bridge, there must be a path joining $v_n$ to $v_0$ that does not include that $e_n$. If we follow that path only as far as the first of the $v_i$ it reaches, we will have a path $\rho: v_n \to v_i$ which uses no edges of the simple path $\gamma'$. We can then append the portion of $\gamma'$ that goes from $v_i$ to $v_n$, call it $\gamma'_i$, to obtain a 1-cycle $c(\rho) + c(\gamma'_i)$ that must have a positive inner product with $c(\gamma)$: $$\langle c(\gamma), c(\rho) + c(\gamma'_i) \rangle = \langle c(\gamma'_i), c(\gamma'_i) \rangle \gt 0$$ 

This question (or at least approximations to the distribution that hold beyond lowest order in the number of points) has practical importance. The "DIEHARD" suite of tests for pseudo-random generators has as one of its tests the generation of many cases of the minimum distance of $N$ points in a 2 or 3 dimensional box, and comparison of the resulting distance distribution, via a K-S test, with the expected distribution. Most correlations between near-time randoms will tend to result in clustering along some curve in $d$-dimensional spaces, and the miminum distance test is quite sensitive to this. Unfortunately, in the original suite, the distribution of distance squared was taken to be exponential with average distance squared of $$\alpha^2 = \frac{2}{\pi N(N-1)}$$ in 2 dimensions. This is derived by simply considering the volume taken up by the previous $k$ balls of radius $2s$ as diminishing the chance that the $k+1$-st ball will "survive" as being further than some distance $s$ from any neighbor. The actual distribution differs from this, for two reasons: The volume excluded is not the simple sum of the volumes of $k$ balls because two of those $k$ balls whose centers are between $s$ and $2s$ apart have some overlapping volume which should not be excluded twice. There is also a boundary effect near the surface of the box. The history is that for a while, the DIEHARD suite had used only the lowest-order exponential distribution. While this was fine for the number of trials that could be run using early computers, by the late 1990's, people were doing more strenuous tests, and documentation for this element of the suite had a statement like "you should not reject the randomness hypotheses unless the $p$-value shown by the K-S test is at least $0.99999$." Of course, that was because you were doing a powerful comparison with the wrong distribution. The change in distribution introduced by these next-lowest-order effects can be calculated analytically; the geometric integrals dealing with 2-sphere overlaps are tractable. In the end, this change can be compensated for in comparing the distributions quite efficiently. The paper FERMILAB-TM-2120 (May 2002) "Distribution of Minimum Distance Among N Random Points in d Dimensions" presents the results. $URL$ With this next-order correction, the distributions are accurate enough even for tests using massive supercomputers. I seriously doubt that a closed-form expression for the distribution exists, even in $2$ dimensions. 

Let's suppose that $M$ is a connected $1$-dimensional smooth manifold (Haussdorf and paracompact). We know that there are exactly two types, up to diffeomorphism (even up to homeomorphism), namely $\mathbb R$ and $S^1$. These are clearly both orientable, and one "high-powered" way to show this it is to show that the top exterior power $\Lambda^n (T^*M)$ of its cotangent bundle, which is the cotangent bundle itself since $n=1$, is trivial, because each of these manifolds is a Lie group. Of course, if you already know that the only ones are $\mathbb R^1$ and $S^1$, you can also directly show from the "oriented cover" definition of orientability that they are indeed both orientable. I am teaching a third-year curves and surfaces course, and what I am looking for is the following. Suppose you don't know what all the connected $1$-dimensional smooth manifolds are. (In my course we can suppose they are embedded submanifolds of $\mathbb R^n$, but that's not very important.) How can one show, using elementary ideas, that any connected curve has to be orientable? I believe that one way to do this is the following: show that any connected curve can be expressed as the image of a single regular parametrized curve. Once we have this, we're done. It is clear that the argument should use the fact that we can always "reparametrize by arc-length", and by measuring the arc-length from a fixed point in a fixed initial direction, one either gets a diffeomorphism with $\mathbb R$ or with $S^1$, depending on whether or not the curve is closed. Is there an easy way to justify this to students in a curves and surfaces class? Is there an easier argument that I haven't noticed? The reason I am thinking about this is because all the undergraduate curves and surfaces texts spend a lot of time explaining why surfaces need not be orientable, but never discuss why orientability is never an issue for curves. They also spend a lot of time talking about "covering a surface with multiple coordinate charts" but never discuss (except for $S^1$, sometimes) the need to cover a curve by more than one chart. It would be nice to be able to give my students an easy (but rigorous) explanation of the orientability of any connected curve. 

Counterexample: Let $n=1, a_1 = 1, f(t) = -t$. Then $y(t) = t$ which is a continuous increasing function of $t$. Did you mean to say increasing? Because in that case, the conjecture is true in intervals where $y(t)$ is strictly greater than zero. 

The naive method of just evaluating $$f(M) = M\log\left(1+\frac{M}{\sum_{i=1}^M\frac{1}{x_i}}\right)$$ is an $O(N)$ algortithm. Since one can, by choosing $$x_N = 1 \\ x_{N-k} = 1+(k-1)\epsilon \text{ when } n-k > m_0 \\ x_{N-k} = k+1 \text{ when } n-k \geq m_0 \\ $$ with $\epsilon$ sufficiently small always adjust the $\{x_i\}$ such that to the optimum value of $M$ is at the arbitrarily chosen $m_0$, there can be no algorithm that is better than $O(N)$ (that is, no "not-iterative" solution). 

An answer to a restriction of this problem: Let $F$ be the space of strictly increasing twice-differentiable functions $f:I \mapsto I$ on an open interval $I \subset \Bbb{R}$ such that the first derivative of $f$ is strictly increasing. Then for each $f\in F$ there exists a unique function $g \in F$ such that $g^2 = f$. This statement holds if you change either (or both) of the words "increasing" to "decreasing. 

To be clear, although we have an embedding of $G$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$, I am not restricting the question to automorphisms that arise from homeomorphisms $\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n$; any graph automorphism of $G$ counts. 

Suppose we have a finite group $G$ with subgroup $H$, a representation $\rho_V$ of $H$ on a finite-dimensional vector space $V$, and an $H$-invariant inner product on $V$: $$\forall x,y\in V, h\in H,\enspace \langle\rho_V(h)x, \rho_V(h)y\rangle = \langle x,y\rangle$$ We will write $V_I$ for the direct sum of $\lvert G:H \rvert$ copies of $V$: $$V_I = \oplus_{i=1}^{\lvert G:H \rvert} V$$ We define a map $L_i$ that lifts $V$ into the $i$th copy in the direct sum: $$L_i: V\to V_I\\ L_i v = 0 \oplus 0 \oplus ... \underbrace{v}_{i\text{th summand}} \oplus 0 + ...$$ We extend the inner product on $V$ to one on $V_I$: $$ \langle \sum_i L_i x_i, \sum_j L_j y_j \rangle = \sum_i \langle x_i, y_i \rangle$$ From each left coset $K_i$ of $H$ in $G$ we pick an element $k_i$, so $K_i=k_i H$. We then have an induced representation $\rho_I$ of the group $G$ on $V_I$: $$\rho_I(g) \sum_i L_i v_i = \sum_i L_{j(g,i)} \rho_V(k_{j(g,i)}^{-1} g k_i) v_i$$ where $j(g,i)$ is the index of the coset $K_i$ to which $g k_i$ belongs. Now, suppose we have an irreducible representation $\rho_W$ of $G$ on some finite vector space $W$. The Frobenius reciprocity theorem says that $Hom_H(W,V)$, the space of $H$-intertwiners from $W$ to $V$, i.e. the space of maps $S$ that satisfy: $$S: W\to V\\ \forall h\in H,\enspace S \rho_W(h) = \rho_V(h) S$$ is isomorphic to the space $Hom_G(W,V_I)$ of $G$-intertwiners from $W$ to $V_I$, i.e. the space of maps $T$ that satisfy: $$T: W\to V_I\\ \forall g\in G,\enspace T \rho_W(g) = \rho_I(g) T$$ Indeed, given an intertwiner $S\in Hom_H(W,V)$ we can easily construct an intertwiner $T_S\in Hom_G(W,V_I)$: $$T_S w = \sum_i L_i S \rho_W(k_i^{-1}) w$$ As we vary $S$ over any basis of $Hom_H(W,V)$, the associated map $T_S$ will map $W$ into distinct subspaces of $V_I$, each of which is invariant under the action of $\rho_I$, and each of which has the property that the restriction of $\rho_I$ to that subspace is equivalent to $\rho_W$. My question is: supposing the dimension of $Hom_H(W,V)$ is greater than 1, does there exist an "easy" strategy to choose a basis $\{S_1,S_2,...\}$ of $Hom_H(W,V)$ such that the subspaces $T_{S_1}(W), T_{S_2}(W), ...$ of $V_I$ will be mutually orthogonal? By "easy", I mean something less computationally demanding than simply finding all the subspaces by means of an arbitrary basis for $Hom_H(W,V)$, and then decomposing their direct sum into orthogonal invariant subspaces. In other words, I am seeking to leverage the fact that $Hom_H(W,V)$ is a lower-dimensional space than the direct sum of the $T_{S_i}(W)$ in order to carry out a less demanding procedure to achieve the same result. Edited to add: One easy way to get a basis of $Hom_H(W,V)$ is to take a sufficient number of linearly independent maps $S^{(0)}_i: W\to V$ and average over the subgroup $H$: $$S_i = \frac{1}{|H|}\sum_{h\in H} \rho_V(h) S^{(0)}_i \rho_W(h^{-1})$$ So by starting with a basis of (non-intertwining) maps from $W$ to $V$, you can project as many as required into $Hom_H(W,V)$ to obtain a basis. My (possibly naive) hope is that there might be some way of modifying this construction to lead directly to a basis with the property I'm seeking. 

Just to follow up on Eric's correct answer: when you have an almost complex structure $J$, you can decompose $1$-forms into type $(1,0)$ and $(0,1)$. Locally, you can find a local basis $e^1, \ldots, e^n$ of $(1,0)$-forms, but these are not of the form $dz^1, \ldots, dz^n$. Indeed, as Eric mentioned, we do not have local holomorphic coordinates. Then $\bar e^1, \ldots, \bar e^n$ are a local basis of $(0,1)$ forms. Now if we compute $de^i$, it is a $2$-form, so it can be written in the form \begin{equation*} de^i = a^i_{jk} e^j \wedge e^k + b^i_{jk} e^j \wedge \bar e^k + c^i_{jk} \bar e^j \wedge \bar e^k. \end{equation*} The almost complex structure $J$ is integrable if and only if all the $c^i_{jk}$'s are zero. 

The Hopf fibrations give 4 such examples: 1) $S^3$ is an $S^1$ bundle over $\mathbb C \mathbb P^1 \cong S^2$, as you mentioned. 2) $S^7$ is an $S^3$ bundle over $\mathbb H \mathbb P^1 \cong S^4$, the quaternionic projective line. 3) $S^{15}$ is an $S^7$ bundle over $\mathbb O \mathbb P^1 \cong S^8$, the octonionic projective line. 4) $S^0$ is an $S^1$ bundle over $\mathbb R \mathbb P^1 \cong S^1$. I don't know if there are any others. 

Let $M$ be any $n\times n$ matrix. We define the usual cofactors: $C_{i,j}$ is $(-1)^{i+j}$ times the determinant of the submatrix obtained by deleting row $i$ and column $j$ of $M$. We can write the determinant of $M$ using Laplace expansion along column $p$ as: $$\det M = \sum_{q=1}^n M_{q,p} C_{q,p}$$ Now, for any $k, p\in \{1,...,n\}$ consider the sum: $$W_{n,p}(k) = \sum_{q=1}^n {M_{q,p} C_{q,p}^2 \prod_{j\ne q}{C_{j,k}}}$$ Clearly $W_{n,p}(p)$ can always be factored, with $\det M$ as one factor: $$W_{n,p}(p) = \sum_{q=1}^n{M_{q,p} C_{q,p}^2 \prod_{j\ne q}{C_{j,p}}} = \sum_{q=1}^n{M_{q,p} C_{q,p} \prod_{j=1}^n{C_{j,p}}} = \left(\det M\right) \prod_{j=1}^n{C_{j,p}}$$ But in all the specific cases I've examined, $\det M$ appears as a factor of $W_{n,p}(k)$ even when $k\ne p$. For example, with $n=3$, $p=1$ and $k=2$: $$W_{3,1}(2)=\sum_{q=1}^3{M_{q,1} C_{q,1}^2 \prod_{j\ne q}{C_{j,2}}}=\\ \left(\det M\right)\left(M_{2,2} M_{2,3} M_{3,1}^2 M_{1,3}^2+M_{2,1} M_{2,3} M_{3,1} M_{3,2} M_{1,3}^2-M_{2,1} M_{2,2} M_{3,1} M_{3,3} M_{1,3}^2-M_{2,1}^2 M_{3,2} M_{3,3} M_{1,3}^2-M_{1,2} M_{2,3}^2 M_{3,1}^2 M_{1,3}+M_{1,2} M_{2,1}^2 M_{3,3}^2 M_{1,3}+M_{1,1} M_{2,1} M_{2,2} M_{3,3}^2 M_{1,3}-M_{1,1} M_{2,3}^2 M_{3,1} M_{3,2} M_{1,3}-M_{1,1} M_{1,2} M_{2,1} M_{2,3} M_{3,3}^2-M_{1,1}^2 M_{2,2} M_{2,3} M_{3,3}^2+M_{1,1} M_{1,2} M_{2,3}^2 M_{3,1} M_{3,3}+M_{1,1}^2 M_{2,3}^2 M_{3,2} M_{3,3}\right) $$ It might be worth noting that the second factor here cannot be written as a linear combination of products of the cofactors, with purely numeric coefficients. This is in stark contrast to the case $k=p$, when the quotient is simply a product of cofactors. I am seeking a proof that $\det M$ always divides $W_{n,p}(k)$, and a general formula for the quotient in the non-trivial case $k\ne p$. 

There is also this long review paper by Yau from 2000: $URL$ where he discusses many big open problems in Riemannian geometry, symplectic geometry, algebraic geometry, and geometric analysis. This can keep you occupied for a long long time... 

For the standard model, and in particular for its representation-theoretic aspects (which are crucial), I would refer you to the excellent recent article by John Baez and John Huerta from the Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society which can be found here: $URL$ There are also references to other articles and books here that could lead you further. If you are interested more generally in quantum field theory and its description for mathematicians (where differential geometry plays a big role, in addition to representation theory), then there is the infamous 2-volume "Quantum Field and Strings: A course for mathematicians" which is written by (mostly) mathematicians. It's not going to necessarily give you the correct physical insight, however. Here are the links: Volume 1 Volume 2 Other good possibilities are Freed-Uhlenbeck's "Geometry of Quantum Field Theory" from the PCMI (Park City) series, or the gargantuan "Mirror Symmetry" from the Clay Math monographs.
