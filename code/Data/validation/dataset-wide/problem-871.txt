If you did a burn in the opposite direction from your Vinf vector, it could reduce your Vinf and drop you even closer to the mass. If your burn vector is at right angles to your velocity vector, it would increase your vinf (and thus raise point of closest approach aka periapsis). It would also change the direction of the hyperbola's asymptote. To better answer your question, I'd need to know more about the geometry of this scenario, what Vesc and Vinf is and how much delta V the ship was capable of. It would be helpful to know at what distance our heroes discover they're in trouble. If the ship has already fallen close enough that it's traveling an appreciable fraction of c, the above doesn't apply. Conics from Newtonian mechanics is a good approximation until you get too close to the black hole. Then you'd need general relativity to model the trajectory -- and that's above my pay grade. 

L4 and L5, the Lagrange points 60 degrees leading and trailing an orbiting body, are famous for being stable. A well known example are the Trojan aseroids at the Sun Jupiter L4 and L5. Nodding to these bodies I label the central mass S, orbiting mass J and the L4 mass T: 

A circle is an ellipse with eccentricity zero. And in fact tidal evolution can drive orbital eccentricity to values negligibly close to zero. See Regarding the Putative Eccentricity of Charon's Orbit. From observations we already know Pluto and Charon move about each other in very nearly circular orbits. I expect when New Horizons flies by the system in July, 2015, we will know their orbits more precisely. 

It would be detectable due to its gravity effect on other planets, comets and the Sun. Check these sites for further info: $URL$ $URL$ 

Exactly. Seasons and its difference between northern and southern hemisphere are caused due to the tilt of the Earth's axis. But this is not the only thing involved. An other important fact is the orbit's eccentricity: a very eccentric orbit would cause a whole planet "summer" when around the perihelion and a whole planet "winter" near the aphelion. There would be also extreme permanent hot zones near the equator and extreme permanent cold zones at poles. 

Yes, and not only from space but from the Earth surface too. Stars emit in almost all wavelengths depending on their surface temperatures. The hotter the star is the shorter (higher energy) wavelengths it'll emit. You can try this simulator to check this: $URL$ 

I can't give you an explicit ant mathematical explanation but maybe this simulations give you a hint. If you look at the bottom one with beta=0.01 (faster initial rotation speed) you will see how possibly a binary or even ternary system is formed. I guess this could be picked as an example for planetary formation. $URL$ 

You can check this thanks to this amazing plot: $URL$ But this is not all you need to hold an stable atmosphere like the Earth does. The object will also need some protection against the solar wind. In the Earth we have a magnetic field that prevents the solar wind to reach our atmosphere, but in the case of Mars it has a weak and poor magnetic field to defend itself against the solar wind that rips it's atmosphere. 

Very roughly: $3.5 \times 10^{33}kg$, or 1800 solar masses. Here's how I came by that number, it is a very rough approximation. The major mass components of the galaxy are stars, the interstellar medium, and dark matter. According to the HYG Database there are approximately 1000 stars within 50 light years of the Earth. The average mass of a star is 0.2 solar masses (thanks to Rob Jeffries in the comments), where a solar mass is about $M_\odot \approx 2 \times 10^{30} kg$. This gives us $4\times 10^{32} kg$ of stars nearby. The interstellar medium (ISM) is primarily atomic hydrogen, and has an average density of 1 proton per cubic centimetre, although it can vary widely in different parts of the galaxy. A proton weighs $1.6 \times 10^{-27} kg$, so a 50 light year sphere of "average" ISM will weigh about $7 \times 10^{32}kg$. We can do a little bit better than that though. Our solar system lives in the local fluff which is a cloud in the local bubble. The local fluff has a radius of about 15 ly, and a density of 0.3 atoms per cubic centimetre. The local bubble is about 150 ly across, and has a density of only 0.05 atoms per cubic centimetre. Using these figures instead we get an approximate ISM mass of $4 \times 10^{31} kg$. This is an order of magnitude smaller than the contribution of stars, and our estimate for the stars could easily be off by more than 10%, so let's err on the high side and say the total mass of stars + ISM is $5 \times 10^{32}kg$. We don't know how much dark matter exactly is in the galaxy, but if its similar to the cosmological average then there is roughly six times as much dark matter as baryonic. If this holds true locally, then there is about $3\times 10^{33}kg$ of dark matter nearby. So, a rough estimate says there is about $3.5 \times 10^{33}kg$ of mass within 50 light years of us. This is equivalent to 1800 solar masses, or $2 \times 10^{60}$ protons! 

We could compare a big star to a small one like a Formula 1 car to a simple car: the F1 is faster, but it runs out of fuel earlier. 

This picture was taken by the WISE (Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer) space telescope. It is in deed an infrared picture of the entire universe but what you see in this line is our home galaxy, the Milky Way. This telescope has taken infrared pictures of the entire Universe (as we see from the Earth) and joined them in this full-sky view. More info: $URL$ 

The Sun will never run out of Hydrogen. This is a common misconception. At this moment the Sun is fusing Hydrogen into Helium. This fused Helium remains at the core until it will reach a critical mass. At this point the core will begin to collapse. This collapse increases the temperature and pressure around the core where Hydrogen is being fused causing the increase the Hydrogen fusion which also causes an increase of the radiation pressure making the outer layers to expand and cool. Once the core reaches a temperature of about 100 million Kelvin Helium fusion starts dramatically (Helium Flash) with high radiation pressure in the core. Here is where the Sun will reach 250 times it's current radius. When the Helium fusion stabilizes the radiation pressure at the cores decreases making the Sun's radius to shrink. The temperature will only drop at the surface because as it's expands it's further from the core. 

To calculate that you will have to build a 3D model based upon the distance of each of their stars and then calculate the resulting 3D object's volume. I know this may not answer the question, but I give the way to answering it. It's not an easy job. Making a quick guess based upon the distances of the stars of both constellations in my opinion I guess the Small Dipper has a bigger volume since it's starts have bigger distance differences ranging from < 100 ly up to > 500 ly. In the case of the Big Dipper all distance are very similar since all stars come from the same open cluster. Their distance range between 78 and 124 ly. Source: 

Assuming circular, coplanar orbits, Trans Venus Insertion (TVI) is 8 km/s from Mercury's surface. That's with horizontal take off and no gravity loss. That's for the minimum energy Hohmann transfer. Exiting the Hohmann transfer and soft landing on Venus would take 11.9 km/s if Venus had no atmosphere. But much, maybe all of that 11.9 km/s could be done by aerobraking. I used my Hohmann spreadsheet to get these numbers. 

I was curious about the same things. I believe it was in the astronomy stack exchange I was referred to an online data base that gives position and velocity vectors for neighboring stars. From those I put together a spreadsheet. Here's a screen capture: 

I'd like to know a little more about the geometry of the ship's trajectory. I would be asking for clarification in comments but I don't know how to put images in comments. A good distance away the ship is moving nearly a straight line with regard to the large mass. As the ship gets closer the path gradually bends towards the large mass. If you're still a fair distance from the star, the path can be fairly well modeled with Newtonian mechanics and the curving path can be modeled as a hyperbola. The straight line the hyperbola is gradually deviating from is called an asymptote: 

I don't think it's doable to pulverize a dino-killer on such short notice. But years of movie and TV sci fi have stretched my WSOD bubble enough that I can consider this. For an 3 km diameter asteroid moving 13 km/s and having a density of 3 tonnes per cubic meter, I get kinetic energy of about 3.6e21 joules. If my arithmetic's right, earth receives about 1.75e17 joules of sunlight each second. So my BOTE seems to indicate about the same energy as 6 hours of sunlight. A hemisphere receiving the energy equivalent of 6 hours of sunlight over a brief time -- it wouldn't be pleasant. I believe we'd be screwed whether the impactor was one chunk or a cloud of gravel. 

Your argument (large temperature leads to greater mixing) is correct so long as there are no other large scale forces acting on the system. This isn't true in planet formation, because gravity plays a very important role. I'm not an expert on planet formation, but I think the argument goes something like this: As a planet forms from material from the protoplanetary disc it will begin very homogenous, something like an asteroid, just rock and metal all the way through. If the planet is heated enough in the core, some material will melt. Buoyancy (due to gravity) will drive lighter material "higher" in the planet, away from the core. The more heat you generate the more melting can happen and the more material will start to separate by density. Of course, there's a lot more to the story. Fluid material obeys the laws of hydrodynamics, so large scale convective flows can form in some regions, mixing those areas quite well. Planetary rotation adds centrifugal and Coriolis forces to the mix, which pull more material to the equator. The surface of a planet is exposed to space and can radiate excess heat, cooling to a solid (like the Earth's crust). If the core is magnetic and rotating, metals in the planet may be pushed by the magnetic field. All this is just to say that planetary formation is a balancing act of a lot of competing forces. These forces can differentiate (or not!) different types of material, but first (for rocky planets at least) they need to be freed by internal heating. 

As you say stars composition depend on the composition of the molecular cloud where they were created. You have a molecular cloud where many stars are being created at the same time, all with the same composition and age, but some are bigger than others. As time goes the bigger stars will die earlier, adding new heavier materials to the cloud which will lead to a new generation of stars with a bigger metalicity. So the star's composition not only depends on where it was created but also on how old it is. The best way this can be checked is by studying the stars within a star cluster.

A quasar is a type of AGN. Its main property is that it's galaxy axis points towards the earth and this way we receive its light and radio signals. That's why they are one of the most energetic AGN. Here you can see a relation of all the AGN types: $URL$ 

That situation would lead to heat transfer between the cold and the hot zones just like it happens here at the Earth. There is a paper on this that may help you: 

The Tidal acceleration between 2 bodies is calculated with this formula: $$ a_T = \frac{2GM_MR_1}{Dm^3} $$ Where $M_M$ is Mar's mass, $R_1$ Earth Radius and $D_m$ the distance to the Moon. If you equal this to Moon's Tidal acceleration you will get $D_M$ as distance to Mars to get the same Tidal acceleration having $\frac{M_M}{M_m}=8.73328184501$: $$ D_M = \sqrt[3]{8.73}D_m\simeq2.06Dm $$
