Porn websites generate a lot of traffic, which means you need some pretty solid technical skills and good decision making abilities in order to get something like that up and running and keeping it that way. On top of this, such sites tend to scale relatively fast, you have to be ready for it. Also, most of the good techniques used to monetize a website also apply to such a site, and this is not as easy as it sounds. 

I'm referring to multiple and diverse types of information, all of which are clearly visible on my resume. There was almost no interview in which I didn't experience this. So, my question is: why does this happen ? Reviewing a resume for 5 - 10 minutes for each candidate you're going to interview shouldn't be that big of a time consumer and it actually gets you more prepared for the actual discussion. EDIT. A little clarification: It's not like I expect them to memorize it or anything. Just skim through it for 5 minutes so that you won't look so surprised if I tell you that I write in a technical blog or that I actively participate on StackExchange or that I actually did work with your technologies in the past. It leaves me a really bad impression of you as a company and/or as an interviewer. Companies keep saying that they need applicants who impress them. Well maybe they should take their own advice once in a while... 

When we write resumes in early stage of career, we try to list down what all technical skill (or soft skills in some cases) to be projected out while you render different work assignments you got into. We expect that recruiters will look at those necessary skills in our profile with the one that are required for the job to get shortlisted, interviewed and hired. By the time you are one of the senior profile, there is a lot of detail in specific work you do, including technical and managerial. Yet, as the technology and times changes, things you learned earlier are rather less relevant; instead your leadership (or leadership skills) are your greatest virtues. When you work in an organization, it is easy to identify who are real great leaders, and who are not. However, when one is trying to put this in a resume, I wonder how do recruiters judge weather you are one of the good/great leaders or you are not a fit leader. of course, I don't think just writing "Great leadership skills" - or even a couple of recommendations by your colleagues on Linked-In can assert that quality. By looking at the actual details of the work - how does one judge whether or not a person is a great good leader or not. How do recruiters actually derive this judgment about people in real life? And what one should highlight in their resume for the recruiters to identify them as good leaders? 

Yes, if an interviewer will ask you about it, it's best to admit that you got fired and also provide some details if they ask for them. However, I would like to point out that most interviewers will probably not believe that the tiny typo got you fired, simply because it's a little ridiculous. I know I wouldn't believe it. They will most likely imagine that you were a poor performer and the email typo was the excuse the company needed to let you go. Now, I doubt the interviewers will explicitly say this to you but, in order to crush those suspicions as best as possible, be extra prepared to prove that you will be a valueable employee. References from people currently working at your last company have the highest chance of accomplishing this. 

Try to keep a fixed regular meetings rather than agenda. E.g. we do weekly project review or bi-weekly status meeting or something. And keep reminding him. this works better than specific agenda meetings because it sets the rhythm and he probably keep in mind that i need to dedicate time. Use calender as much as possible. So even if he doesn't honor the meeting actually, as number of instances of lost meetings grow, you will get some attention. Keep him posted - of all events, consequences. Many people (specially the busy ones) focus only to attend the top priority. So when you keep sending message they will respond automatically when they find it important enough. Don't wait for meeting to discuss to send out important message. Catch him for few minutes in corridors. Sometimes leaving them with a small agenda (puzzle in their minds) is enough to activate them rather than an elaborate meeting. What you should look forward is to bring his focus to the key issue leaving so many details. Don't fight to get more time. What do you need him for? If you need for decision making - you should put up the context right to him along with deadline. But if you need his time to learn new things or understand some processes or systems, find alternative sources for information. Sometimes bosses don't really have time for coaching everyone. Last but most important. Keep going on your own! Don't get bothered so much about getting appointment. Many of my team members feel what you said - i don't give them time. Sometimes, i just don't have to. I Know things are in control, i know people are doing their job well enough and i don't need to intervene unless something break; but they just feel disappointed not to find my time; rather they should have felt happy about being empowered. [Judge him on this before you use this tip.] 

Now, on to how this might be corrected: First of all, unlike many other situations, don't be afraid to correct someone in public regarding this issue. In general, people should not feel embarrassed about something like this. Second, do it as often as you can. People will get a little annoyed by it. So, to counteract the balance back in your favour, iterate how important it is to use the term correctly. Pick a few short and relevant examples on what might go wrong in such a situation. In extreme cases, VERY bad things can happen with such miscommunication; like the example mentioned here: 

TL/DR: Send an email with your technical concerns to both your direct manager and the Executive-General-Manager. Slightly longer : Short and simple: Write an email with all the issues you've found, which were not handled. Put your manager in the "To" field, put the Executive-General-Manager in the "CC" field. It's very important to have a written trail of your technical concerns. From what you describe, it appears the General-Manager really trusts your expertise and advice. If the project gets delivered as-is, the General-Manager will be under the impression that you put your "technically-approved" stamp on it, since from his point of view you didn't report any problems. When those issues come up (when, not if), you'll be one of the people who are going to be held accountable. At that point, saying won't help you at all, since it will only appear that you're trying to avoid responsibility (besides, it can't be factually verified). Now, there is a chance that your direct manager will see that email as a way of bypassing him and his authority. That's why it's important to keep a very very calm and professional tone in both your email message and yourself if you'll be directly confronted about this by your direct manager. It will go a long way to minimize any damage to your professional relationship with your direct manager. 

This is a question that applies to all people not just interns. I am here putting up the basic thought process and then going on to your specific case. 1. Nature of reward: You may ask for reward in general - reward may include, "one time incentive" or bonus, "increase in fixed pay", "increase in variable pay", "ESOP", or "equity". Understand that each type of rewards has consequences for the company as far as current as well as future payout is concerned. So it is not at all obvious which way the company would agree to reward. Equity might be an easy bid when start up is close to day 1 and there is hardly any investment or revenue in place. However, otherwise the equity is something might be preferred last. Even to many employees ESOPs are given rather than direct equity. So in all, this boils down to the founder's or managements comfort on how they want to reward. Be open to the mode they are willing to work on. 2. Amount of Reward: What is also important is to establish how a 'given work' has implication to longer term earnings of the company that would justify the amount of reward. Given this, it is important that candidate's perception matches with that of managements. It may not be obvious that what you think might not be their top priorities. Put other way it is also important that you seek feedback about the effectiveness of the work -and quality of work- before talking about rewards. If they agree that your work has really shaped some strategic problems or is valuable in someway - then asking for reward becomes next obvious thing. if they don't quite think so, you know what to expect when looking for reward. 3. When This is critical. Great ideas seldom makes money. They become instrumental when the real products meets real markets. And there are lot of things that need to go right. Not to disappoint, but what is important is that for you to maximise your possible reward - or to make it easier to get through, it makes sense to put across at right time. Typically, it means things are 'complete' in some sense, some 'real feedback' of trial is available or some results are proven in some manner. Given all of the above: Here is what I would suggest: 

While sexual harrasment is definitely not OK, there's something you need to keep in mind: if you decide to take the legal route suggested by @apaul34208, you will have a very very hard time maintaining a good working relationship after all this, even if you win. What your boss did is probably insufficient for her to be dismissed, which means, after all the legal "battle" is over, she will still be your boss. And your working relationship with her will be very difficult or awkward. Quitting or transfering to another team or department is probably going to be the next step. So, my advice is: if you try to involve lawyers and everything that comes with it, expect the complications mentioned above to occur. 

As a candidate, i would always keep GradePoint/UniversityScore in the resume. You never know what is in the mind of recruiter. I don't quite rule out the possibility that some recruiters will find it important. However, as a recruiter, i personally don't care much. There are times when people don't quite shine in university system but do exceptionally well in the practical outlook of the problems in real world. So in general, grade point becomes least criteria and work experience matters much. However, when you are a fresher, probably there is no other measure (job experience) is available. So grade point does become the primary (if not ultimate) criteria. So it is most important. 

Here are several criteria you think of when you hire - and comment on which one that needs special care when hiring someone currently unemployed. 1. Fitment to job - NO difference However, you can note that currently unemployed guy might be a bit more desperate and try to stretch himself to fit. Just ensure he/she can genuinely fits. 2. Past performance and Talent - To some extent However, Person with a relatively longer gap, even if he has done good work in past - might be out of touch. This means there must be indeed good potential, yet the recruiter must set expectations regarding how long will it take for the person to start being very productive again. 3. Number of years of experience - To some extent If the current job is drastically different, then the person might take significant turn around and person is more like a fresh person. The mutual expectations must be very clear. Hiring the person might not be wrong decision but defining role might be very crucial. 4. Personal factors vs. assignments - very critical Quite often, personal factors play a significant impact on performance. Sometimes new job brings fresh new energy in people and they are really want to make a mark; on the other hand if the reason has been off from work due to serious family personal issues and still not out from it, and if job puts him under immense pressure he/she might only end up compounding the problems. 5. How would one have a drive in the job? - the key concern. When people are meeting target after target, there is a reason to believe that the person will keep excelling; when there are gaps we are not sure. There would be some who wants to come back where as when it is not for genuine reasons, this would be a key concern to ensure that people will have the drive to rush through the finish line or putting the quality in the assignments. 

Maybe 26K was before taxes and 20.34K is after taxes. So there's a reasonable chance that they didn't lie to you. I recommend proceeding with caution: don't go in there with accusations and finger pointing. Instead, state your concern about this in a polite and calm manner. 

Even if people on this site tell you the way they do it or the way it's usually done, such things can easily be completely different based on company culture. Therefore, in my opinion, the best solution is to just ask one of your coworkers about the way it's done in your company. They will probably be glad to help you. By-the-way: the more formal your company is (especially larger ones), the more likely it is that the answer to your main question is No.
