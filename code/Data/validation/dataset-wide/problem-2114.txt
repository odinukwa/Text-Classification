I interviewed in places where my prospective boss's tie was probably worth more than my car. I also interviewed in places where, if I hadn't known it's a job interview, I would think I accidentally walked in on high-school party. Never once I had dressed in anything less than a full suit with a tie. No matter what you think about the company, it's image etc., by dressing in a formal attire you show respect - after all, it's a meeting between two strangers with the intent to discuss business - appropriate clothing shows that you care about the interview and that you were willing to take time to prepare. 

If you yawned once, covered your mouth and apologized, it's no big deal. If you do it continuously, you send a message that a) your interviewer is boring you b) you didn't think the interview was important enough to get a good night's sleep. Stretching your arms has the same connotation. As for their reply, there's pretty much no point in continuing, because it's either a genuine concern of theirs, or "random excuse #27" to not hire you. Either way, move on, try to suppress those behaviors and good luck on your job hunt. 

I know there are many questions about the dreaded "other duties as assigned" clause in most contracts. Mine has one as well. However, I feel the task assigned to me goes way off what would be expected of someone in my profession. I was recently assigned with developing a process which requires extensive legal and finance knowledge - something I'm not even remotely qualified to do (I'm a software developer). Of course, the logical step would be to ask the legal and finance team for help - they, however, refuse (or are not interested) to provide help. I communicated this to my manager, and his response was basically "I don't care how, do it". Now, I don't have the authority to make the knowledgable folks help me - what are my options in this situation? Am I in the "set sail for fail" kind of situation? 

This is actually a very normal thing to do, not only in the computer industry, but also in virtually every other industry. I have found that the majority of people in cyber security for example, were usually in a branch of the armed forces. What's more important is that you go after the things you are interested in and pursue opportunities. You have just graduated, you still have plenty of time to figure out what you want to do. Because you mention the computer industry, I can confidently say this will not affect you at all. Some even may look at it as a very positive thing. This is a decision only you can make, but it certainty will not affect your future employment. You have a long, long career 

Very simply, no. You are not required or obligated to go. In fact, if you truly do not want to go or not interested in the job opportunity, cancel and do not waste your time or the employers time. Although they won't be happy, it would save them time and money to focus on another candidate that is interested. Note: This probably won't look great on you cancelling last minute, so expect bridges to be burned. 

I am actually asking this question in place of a co worker of mine, we will call him Bill. I am currently the tech lead of our company and one of my co workers, who I am in charge of on the technical side, approached me today. Bill is a junior level security engineer simply because he only has 1 year of experience. Having said that, Bill works as if he has 10 years in the industry, truly. Recently we have been getting more clients and Bill has had to take lead on some projects when my plate is full. Our senior management tags Bill on the emails and such and says "Hello client A, Bill, a senior level security engineer, will be your point of contact". Bill's official job title is "junior security engineer" (on his contract) and gets paid as such. Bill approached me today and asked if it is wise to talk to management about this and request a new official job title, which would come with salary, perks,etc. I really didn't have a answer for him other than it seems a bit unfair, after all, Bill does senior level work and they tell clients he is a senior, but gets paid like a junior. How should I help Bill when He brings it up with me tomorrow? Is this fair for the company to tell clients he is senior level but pay him significantly less? Thanks! 

Only respond to the managers: "I am sorry that I could not solve this issue before you were bothered with it - Thanks to colleague X who identified this subtle error, I expect that it is fixed within x minutes". Update the report and send it to anybody (if you like to play an especially ugly game: anybody but the colleague who pointed out the mistake). 

What does you boss need to know? He/She needs to know about the problem this may cause. It's not so much relevant for why there is a shortage but that there is a shortage. Briefly inform him that on that day you will need to shift some work, and (depending on the nature of the business) customers will have to wait/not be served, a project will be delivered late, deadlines will be missed etc... Be specific about it so that he can estimate the impact. It sounds like he is not only the boss but also the owner of the company, so he can make up his mind if loosing a customer or paying fees is worth it. 

In that sense I think it's better if all of you did not put this on the management level. However, if I did get in this situation (two people slapping me and lying about it), I would try to find (not expose) a dirt on them as a possible defense. 

She: getting drunk, hitting you and lying about it He: Hugging a drink female colleague and hitting you and lying about it You: Making some joke instead of leaving them alone 

I only express dissatisfaction with my colleagues opinions on such matters when their opinion clearly puts them outside the constitution. If they stop being objective on a too short timescale, i rather just make a mental note to give them a task requiring balancing between interests 

I'm in a situation where my Boss only wants very simple answers. The problem is that in the information security and software business, this doesn't really exist. Here is the situation. My Boss is in the process of drawing up contracts for clients where they pay us for services rendered, simple. My Boss brings me in, says "hey, based on our current stack (how everything is set up), could we support 20,000 clients?". My first answer consists of lots of questions. What client is it? How many hosts per client? What operating system? What services? What processes? How is their network set up? Etc. There is not a straight forward answer. My Boss than says, "I just need a yes or no answer so I can relay this to the client". I basically refuse to give him a answer and try to explain. He wants to say "x=2 and y=3 and so x*y=6. But it is never that simple in the software business because there are many other externalities. He gets frustrated because he wants a yes or no answer but we do not have the available information from the client to say so. I have expressed that we should tell the client "let's start out with 1000 hosts and we can build our way up as both of us are happy" but this gets refused. How do I deal with a Boss that does not understand the complexities and wants a clear cut answer I don't feel comfortable giving? 

I currently work at company A. I have worked here for over a year and I love the environment, job, etc. During this time, I have also started my own side business that isn't related to company A, it is more of a product than a business. This does not affect my work at company A at all (performance reviews have been fine, getting raises, etc). I have recently launched my side business product and it is doing decently well for a single person start up. Now, while I mentioned company A is not related to the start up, it would help them in a huge way. So my boss contacted me today during work and asked me how the side business was going and I said well. He expressed a lot of interest to integrate my side product into company A. And here is the problem. He believes that because I work for the company A, my side product will be 100% free. Not only free, but work to tailor it to their preferences to fit them. I do love working for company A but I have also worked very, very hard on my product. If I am honest, I would not give the product away for free to another company(and I have not). I'm afraid by saying "hey boss, this isn't free", he will take it as if I am leveraging my position (get paid salary from company A who then pays me agin for the product). How do I treat company A as a customer/client and not as a employer of mine? How do I manage this situation without it blowing up? Edit: he never said "it's nice this will be free too", but I am very confident he believes this is the case. Having worked with him for over a year, you start to understand how a person works. 

What I think you misunderstand is working knowledge versus book knowledge. When someone says "Do you know (insert a language) well?" he doesn't mean "Have you memorized every bit of documentation, know all the overloads of every function etc.". They usually mean "Can you look at the code and easily (identify flaws/introduce changes/fix bugs/refactor/etc.)? Can you make an informed decision on what tools to use for a given scenario? Can you outline the advantages and disadvantages of proposed solutions?". Many languages are nearly identical in the general idea: syntax may be different, a few concepts done differently and some of the caveats are unique to a language, but if you know for example C# well, you would have little trouble if someone asked you to do something in Java. You need to keep your knowledge current: again, it doesn't mean that if a new framework comes out, you need to know it by heart in the next week - but the knowledge that such a framework exists, what are it's advantages over competing solutions, what scenario would that framework be used in and in what scenarios it shouldn't be used etc. That's, in my understanding, keeping your knowledge current. If on top of that you can type the code without the use of any aid such as documentation, more power to you - but do remember that it's not the main thing. Knowing a solution is ok. Knowing there are 10 possible solutions, their strengths and weaknesses, where to find their implementation - that's even better. It is possible to find a job with what you know so far - albeit it will probably will not be a job of your dreams. You should however strive to find a job that offers you: 

Very careful - dangerous ground - for one of your contacts acknowledging such a goal, you need to be friends, and they need to like risks. Could be much easier to found your own company together and after a decent time change to another company, under your own responsibility. Taking over teams from other companies without their consent may not sit well with the original employer - when a single employee leaves it's very difficult to argue that he "can take away a customer with him". If a team leaves and take customer contacts, projects etc. with them, the original employer will make very sure that they do not take any IP with them developed when they were still employed. Be prepared to walk out naked - no codebase, fewer customers, and possibly an HR-related lawsuit on your back. 

I will reformulate the question into something more general: Does an expectation onto the first task for an beginner which is not matched make him bad in his job? No, I would not draw such a conclusion from this observation. 

My answer is significantly shorter than most answers here: It is the function of the HR department to perform this process in a way that there will be no repercussions against the company (and as such, you). If you have the feeling that you already said something which may be interpreted as a discriminatory action, tell this to HR (in the "i have the feeling, that he interpreted this differently from what i meant" way), and ask HR if you should switch this person to another manager.If HR decides to let him with you, it is their responsibility - ask them for advice and let HR guide the process and follow theirs course of action When i am confronted with such a situation, I only discuss the very specific problems which I had in a specific situation with that person, and ask him/her for the a small improvement (for example informing co-workers/me when there is a problem/delay). If he/she does this reliably at some point, the next thing can be fixed - or not, if he/she does not.
