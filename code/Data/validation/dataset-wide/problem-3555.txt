In general I'd just say that anything where you need a wide stance is going to be problematic and aggravating. Where your knees are relatively close together and you're not engaging your hip adductors as much, you should be okay. 

There are a few 5x5 formulas out there, the first that I'm aware of being Bill Starr's. The "madcow 5x5" variant was initially set up as modded version for body builders, with the power clean being replaced by barbell rows. Fundamentally, between those two and all the others you still end up with a basic formula of Monday:Volume / Wednesday:Light / Friday:Heavy . Most of the changes between the different 5x5 programs are switching out cleans for deadlifts, incline for flat bench, or other things of that sort. The weekly schedule, and ~2.5% weekly increase in weights is the same. 

A lot depends on what you mean by "training" for your half marathon. Are you just trying to finish it, are you looking to get under 1:30, are you trying to qualify for a higher level race? Those are big differences in training intensity. The best I've found is going into running mode with a decent amount of mass, and then making sure you're lifting heavy when you are. Aim for reps in the 3-5 range, compound. Those can be murder on your legs, so with squats and deads you need to pick between running and strength at half marathon distances. Upper body stuff won't be as big of a deal. And although running can cause a lot of lower body (temporary) injuries, it normally leaves your upper body alone so that helps to cut down on possible overuse. Running and lifting go fine together, but competitive distance running and competitive strength sports are akin to plane wings. One dips, the other rises. 

Get your asthma under control with a preventer medication, like QVAR, although there are other options you can discuss with a physician or nurse practitioner. Beyond asthma specific medications, talk to your provider about allergy medications as well. You may even be prescribed a small batch of prednisone to keep handy, as it can honestly be the difference between life and death in severe cases. Again, talk to your provider about this. Exercise only in a climate controlled and air filtered room. HEPA filters and an air conditioner can go a long way towards keeping the air in such a state that it doesn't aggravate your condition. During exceptionally challenging seasons (spring pollen, a bitterly cold winter, etc) you may end up using this as well. 

I would make sure you're doing these: Warmup. I don't do anything until I've broken a sweat and have exercised the particular parts of my body I'm about to use. Running doesn't warm you up for bench pressing, and pushups don't warm you up for squats. It's rare for me to warmup for more than 5 minutes, alternating between Turkish getups, jump rope, and overhead squatting an empty bar. Rowing machines work good too, but I like using weights to warmup if I'm lifting. Electrolytes. The biggest problem I ever had in this department was in the tropics where the heat and humidity caused incredible sweating. I had to drink a cup mixed with ~1/4 tsp salt before I worked out to get through it. Flexibility The only reason I bring this up is because the muscle at work in the hanging leg raise is the iliopsoas, which most people have really bad flexibility in. Personally I'd avoid targeted movements like that unless you're trying to solve a problem. The more typical-human-movement compound stuff tends to keep you in balance without having to think about it much. 

The human body has a pretty natural way to produce force. If you had to push a car, you would (probably) take a breath, hold it in, bend your knees, and bend your elbows. Giving a car a push with arms fully locked is naturally unappealing for the reasons I tried to breakdown above. 

It's not really possible to hand out a speed to you and say "this is how fast you should ride". If we're talking about a competitive level cyclist, I think you'll find that most riders are comfortable holding a ~32km / 20mph pace for several hours at a time, on flat surfaces. In fact if you look at the RAAM (Race Across America) you'll see average paces frequently crossing over 15MPH, and that's riding 8 days pretty much consistently. So a bit slower than a training ride, but that's averaging in big mountain climbs and obviously an incredible distance (2,000+ miles). In the RAAM male 60-69 age bracket, the speed drops to ~11.5 MPH (again, for 8 days straight). In 1989, Greg LeMond did a 24km time trial at an average speed of 54.545 km/h, or 33.9 mp/h. Three things I'd recommend for you if you'd like to increase your speed: 

"Real food" that is naturally high in protein will always in out over powders nutritionally speaking. This is largely dependent on where you live. In the United States whey protein is relatively cheap, and animal meat is relatively expensive. In most developing nations however meat is much cheaper than the cost of importing a tub of whey. 

Optimally the best results would probably be to not even need them because you have such a great diet of fresh whole food. I'm guessing you're talking about whey protein, so I guess you could say optimal would be an hour or so after lifting with a bit of carbohydrate. The reality though is that with your routine and protein shakes, you'd be much better off doing a real strength training program and trying to eat more real food. 

What are some good strength training options for someone just starting out? Specifically related to building a solid foundation of strength across all major muscle groups. 

I think the best you're going to get on this is anecdotal broscience. No medical professional in their right mind would advise the use of EC/ECA and HIIT, or even just EC/ECA on their own I'd imagine. So what you should do is not use ephedra/caffeine off label. In the anecdotal broscience world, I'd avoid combining EC/ECA ingestion with anything resembling HIIT. It might maximize fat loss, but it's also going to maximize your heart rate beyond safe limits. You can read up on bodybuilding forums about people doing all kinds of things to their body and getting killer aesthetics, but the science against ephedra and sports use is pretty clear. 

You're getting down to the biology of muscle contraction. You can read up on the sliding filament model, which is really quite interesting. Basically your muscles contract because of chemical reactions (temporarily chemically altering your cells). Ca2+ (calcium) is used heavily in the process, and it gets depleted. The more force your muscles need to produce, the more calcium they'll use up. Related to your bench press example, your muscles are chemically using less ingredients in order to push the bar up with less weight. When you start asking for a lot of it (heavy weights) in a short period of time (more reps) you cause it to use more more muscular fuel (ATP, calcium, etc). You also are causing physical fiber damage routinely to your muscles when pushing them hard so you are mechanically weaker. There are other things too, which might even matter more. Decreased serotonin, which can happen after long exercise, can lower your neural effectiveness at firing muscles (a.k.a. "cns fatigue"). Maybe there's plenty of calcium, but now it's a serotonin thing. 

It gets referenced a lot, but for good reason: check out Mark Rippetoe's Starting Strength. The book and the program is, from my prospective, the most effective short and long term path to human strength. Whether you decide to be a Rippetoe fan for the rest of your life is up to you, but the things you learn from it and the path it puts you on really can be life changing. The specific components, summarized, in Starting Strength consists of this: 

So to really determine "how close to failure", you really need to know what you're looking to accomplish. In general though training to failure consistently is a poor idea especially in the lower rep ranges. Right before "failure" happens your form deteriorates and exposes you to serious risk if you have sufficient load. Doing bicep curls to failure is one thing, doing deadlifts to failure is another. An overarching thing you might want to consider is getting on a good program. You'll find a lot of love towards Starting Strength by Mark Rippetoe. If you don't want to buy the book, you can find enough info online to cobble together the right ingredients but the ~$30 the book will cost is far more than worth the amount of time, injuries, and frustration you'll save. Progressive Overload Your main goal should be to progressively overload your body, causing you to routinely go into supercompensation throughout the week. It's these small incremental increases (think: filling up a bathtub one tablespoon at a time) that add up to strength and mass increases. To systematically and predictably do that, you can't just head into the gym and toss weight around. You should be entering a gym knowing (a) what you're going to do and (b) how much of it you're going to do, and those should be calculated values. You can get strong by randomly lifting weights, but if you want to get past the novice stage and progressive as an intermediate athlete you'll need to have solid programming. 

I can't state that the temperature was your problem, but it's the title of the question so I'm going to answer that specifically. Someone who is acclimated to heat will have numerous physiological advantages over someone who is not: 

For something like that, you can consider the agility ladder. Doing a pattern forward, then on a verbal command switching immediately to a reverse pattern, is very helpful but extremely difficult. In summary, agility and rapid force production training is no different than with an adult. I wouldn't take a fit 28 year old and have them do barbell cleans unless they had good form and I wouldn't do it with an 8 year old either. But if both of them have been taught and know what to do, evidence and practical experience in professional training shows exercises like the clean to be incredibly valuable. For agility, consider what your young athlete really needs. Quick direction changes? Immediate stops? Combining explosive training with the mind-muscle connection that comes from agility drills will serve any athlete well. 

It's a pretty broad question and all I can offer up is anecdotal knowledge, but I'll take a stab at it. If I really dial in my diet, walk a couple of hours each day, and keep lifting, I can drop about 1lb of fat per week. I think that's "noticeable" on someone who otherwise stays pretty lean. More simply, a skinny person losing 10 pounds looks a lot skinnier than an obese person losing 10 pounds. For strength training, I recommend to anyone starting that they give themselves 6-9 months before they start flexing in the mirrors and seeing definition. It's coupled with body fat: the more fat you have, the harder it will be to see muscular definition. Maybe this picture will help explain a bit. The lower your body fat gets, the more impact 1lb of fat loss has. At the same time, the lower your body fat, the more noticeable any changes in muscle definition will be. 

The abstract of the study doesn't indicate the training level of the 13 participants, which is a ridiculously small sample size to start with. But I'll assume they are completely untrained and therefore will benefit from easy early gains. 18 sessions is also a relatively small amount of time. "No Load" sounds like "isometric", so this isn't anything particularly new. The muscle has resistance against its also-flexed antagonistic muscle (like a bicep tensing against a tricep). It's an interesting data point, but I don't see the applicability. If anything I could imagine a SUPER NO LOAD DVD EXTREME PACK being developed out of this and marketed as "research shows it's nearly just as effective and weight lifting!" Digging in a bit and focusing on isometric activities, specific to cardiology there's a 1992 study that talks about the impacts of isometric exercises and the heart: 

You can get some pretty safe-bet answers, and largely this dictates your training level. If you can recover in 24-48 hours, you're in the novice stage. If you need a weekly program to cause (and recover from) supercompensation, you're an intermediate. Len Kravitz wrote a nice overview. I'm not aware of any studies, other than specific looks into modifiers (sphingosine 1-phosphate , STAT3 inhibitors, nitric oxide, alcoholism, etc). Hormones, rest, protein, hydration, existing illness, and age all come into play (plus many other elements). There are a lot of factors involved to answer your question. Your max squat will cause much less damage to your body than the max squat of a high level power lifter. You will probably be fully recovered in 48 hours, and that power lifter might spend a week doing 50% of his or her max. 

You need to build strength (via a proper program) and change your lifestyle. Instead of sitting down, get a stand up desk. Go walking for lunch, ride your bike or walk to something instead of driving, and basically try to get out of the seated position as often as you can. Your body will adapt to whatever you throw at it. Start providing it stimulus it needs in order to get stronger and healthier. 

So it depends a bit on your activity level. You won't find many high level athletes who don't eat a single carb. Expanding a bit, gluconeogenesis allows for glucose to be created from fat and protein. "Do I need carbs?" is a very different question from "Do I need glucose?" Additionally, eating truly zero carbohydrates is nearly impossible. Most foods, including whey protein powders, have trace amounts. You're asking a theoretical question (which is fine), but outside of laboratory conditions it's not really going to happen. 

The criticisms of artificial sweetener are overstated and there's nothing I'm aware of that shows a causal relationship between artificial sweeteners in human beings and real adverse health. Mind you, these substances have been scrutinized more than almost anything else you'll ingest. From the Mayo Clinic: 

In short, the study you're referencing is for people who were cold-conditioned prior to the study ("regular winter swimming"), and unlike your experience they were aerobically engaged. 

I can't verify it, but I don't think it was snapping hip syndrome (SHS). Everything about SHS is related to the hip joint itself, and mine was much more in the hamstring-adductor area. I'm not sure exactly what fixed it, but I went at it from a few angles and haven't had the issue for a couple of weeks now. 

First off, great work on getting your nutrition squared away. The habits you've developed will put on you a lifelong trajectory of health: it's really not an overstatement to say that it's one of the most important things you could have done for yourself. I'll try to answer your direct question first:
