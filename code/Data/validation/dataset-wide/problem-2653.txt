There are several points of confusion here. First, your examples are someone more complicated than they need to be because of the temporal aspect of the problem (immortality). We need to make a distinction between global statements that are falsifiable in practice (such as "All crows are black" which equals "No crows are white" which can be falsified by examining all crows, and which remains true even if a white crow is hatched tomorrow) and those which are not (such as "All men are mortal" which equals "No man is immortal", which cannot be tested as the test of immortality would require waiting until after the end of time). If we set aside this problematic, we now come to an question of what we mean by truth. Some philosophical traditions make a distinction between observed truths and inferential truths; other argue that they have the same truth status. Pragmatism, on the other hand, argues that the "cash value" of truth is tied to its utility, so a statement can be considered to be "true" even if it cannot be rigorously and falsifiably verified. All of this is orthogonal to your next problematic, which is known in the philosophy world as the "is-ought distinction", and was most famously raised by Hume. There's no need to drag normative statements into the discussion, as they have no bearing on truth and falsifiability. Finally, you write: 

First off, let's be careful not to reify "emptiness"; emptiness is itself empty. So, my worldly perception of the cup is not the effect of the interaction between my mind and "emptiness" per se, but between my mind (which is empty) and the cup, (which is empty). No one is saying the that cup isn't there, or that I am imagining it, or anything like that. Solipsism doesn't raise its head. The point is that the cup is not existing in and of itself, partaking of an eternal Platonic essence of cupness, without dependence upon any other object. There are a number of good English-language books on Madhyamaka which are aimed at readers with a background in Western philosophy; I'd particularly recommend Jan Westerhoff's "Nagarjuna's Madhyamaka", Jay Garfield's "The Fundamental Wisdom of the Middle Way" (which is a translation with commentary of the MMK), and Mark Siderits's "Buddhism As Philosophy" (which is an overview of Buddhist philosophy tout court, but has a chapter on Madhyamaka and emptiness.) 

It's difficult to answer this question the way it is currently framed, but I'll give it a shot, and re-write if you refine the question. First, we need to figure out who we mean by "post-structuralists". There's a pretty diverse of people who generally get this label applied to them (and very few, if any, who use it as a self-appellation), and these folks have a pretty wide set of interests. However, we can safely say that there are not many among who have taken it upon themselves to comment directly on physics or the natural sciences. Second: the role of objective reality and its relation to mathematical abstractions is a difficult and complex one, and has been the subject of much work in the phenomenological tradition, so to the extent that some of the "post-structuralists" are also phenomenologists, you'll see some overlapping concerns. In broad terms, I don't think there's anyone who questions that there is something that appears to us as "objective reality", and the point of view of a phenomenological analysis, we can "bracket" the ontological status of the ultimate referent-- in other words, we can take a fictionalist approach. And, similarly, I don't think there's anyone who doubts that mathematical abstractions (as in physics) provide a good enough description of our world for pragmatic purposes. Put another way: the caricature of post-structuralist thought that some physicists hold (and attack) in the so-called "Science Wars" is a straw man, and the "War" is being fought in the minds of these scientists only. Arkady Plotnitsky makes this case quite well here. EDIT: Since the question has been supplemented, I'll supplement my answer a bit. The question described in the comments seems to actually be a bit broader, the task of "trying to separate seductive aspects of language from model building." This is not limited, on the one hand, to physics or natural science, nor limited to post-structuralism. Rather, the question comes down to the relationship between the map and the territory, between the explanandum and the explanans. Most (non-Platonist) philosophers recognize that the correlation between the two will never be perfect, and that a better question is if the description is adequate to the phenomenon. To answer whether the description in the four papers referenced is adequate for its intended purpose is beyond my knowledge or interest-- I scrupulously avoid anything with the word "Quantum" in it-- but I would hope that a careful reading of the texts would allow an ideal reader to ascertain whether the authors have been able to overcome the seductions of their own formalizations, and recognize the necessary leakage referred to above. 

What's the difference between the Turing Test and the Turing Test for Reference? I'm not sure I can explain it better than Putnam can, but I'll try: The traditional Turing Test (hereafter TT) is, as you no doubt know, an exercise where a human communicates via what we would now call "chat" with either a) another human, or b) a computer simulating a human. The object of the endeavour is to determine, through conversation, whether the entity on the other side of the chat (i.e., the partner) is a human or not; if the partner ends up being a piece of software capable of consistently fooling humans, then we have a piece of AI which has "passed the Turing Test." Some folks argue that AI capable of passing the Turing Test is conscious; others reject this. Putnam here proposes a modified Turing Test, the Turing Test for Reference (hereafter TTFR), which resembles the standard TT in all regards, except for one significant difference: the object of the exercise is not to determine if the partner is human or not, but rather, to determine whether the partner refers to the same objects that we do. For example, if the entity refers to a "table", do they mean the same thing that we mean when we refer to a "table"? If the partner ends up convincing us, through conversation, that they refer to objects in the same manner we do, then the partner has "passed" the TTFR. Putnam then goes on to argue that even if we have a partner who has passed the TTFR, that still does not guarantee that we actually have "shared reference". 

Well, certainly he should know enough not to make foolish statements like the one above. Since science (and thus physics) is based upon the principle of controlled observation, a good knowledge of epistemology would seem to be de minimis; I suppose that a phenomenological approach seems appropriate to me, but that might be getting too prescriptive. Certainly it would be a good idea, also, to get a good enough overview of ontology to understand why metaphysics is not reducible to physics. 

Yes, mathematics (and classical logic) are based upon beliefs and assumptions. Some of these are spelled out explicitly, as axioms. Others generally go unstated. A good example of this is found in Lewis Carroll's seminal paper What the Tortoise Said to Achilles 

The easy answer here is to say that the material exists, but "heap-ness" is a predicate which may or may not be present. 

That's the problem, or rather, the reason why infinite regress isn't a problem to you. Infinite regress doesn't explain anything, which is why it is a problem for people looking for explanations. Note that this problem isn't limited to infinite regress; in fact, all explanatory systems will ultimately reduce to one of three (unsatisfactory) cases, of which infinite regress is but one. 

That depends upon how you define "the well-being of the group". Suppose we have 10 people who each have one loaf of bread, and compare them to 10 people, where 9 have nothing and 1 has 10 loaves of bread. What is your metric for measuring the well-being of the group? 

Absolutely. We should not dismiss them out of hand, but try to understand the relationship between their philosophical project and their personal beliefs. One notable example of an attempt along these lines is Jacques Derrida's "Of Spirit: Heidegger and the Question". 

What would lead you to believe that consciousness has been selected, or that it offers any evolutionary benefit? It could just as easily be an epiphenomenon, a "spandrel" (to use Steven Jay Gould's term). 

I'd recommend Simon Glendinning's On Being With Others: Heidegger, Derrida, Wittgenstein as a nice example of the genre; Glendinning treats of a fairly narrow question (the refutations of skepticism about other minds) from a variety of perspectives-- besides the three authors listed in the subtitle, he also brings Austin and McDowell into the mix. In doing so, he introduces the thought of Heidegger and Derrida to an audience he assumes will be more familiar with the analytic side of things. 

The "aim of philosophy" and "what philosophers wish to achieve" are two different questions. If you are asking about the aim of philosophy, that is a teleological question. Many contemporary philosophers will reject the notion of a telos out of hand; others might give an answer similar to the one your professor gave. If you are asking what philosophers wish to achieve, this is a question of psychology, and not philosophy. If I were being glib, I'd suggest that most wish to achieve tenure-- but that's clearly not a fair statement. 

Nietzsche is critiquing the morality of the ruling classes of his time, who are, indeed, Christian. It's not therefore "more correct" or "less correct" to say this; it is a fundamental part of Nietzsche's argument. 

The SEP article on Paraconsistent Logic describes a number of systems that deny logical explosion; perhaps you can begin there. In terms of everyday life, most paraconsistent systems function just as you'd expect-- you operate identically to classical logic until you reach a contradiction; if you do reach a contradiction, you note it and move on, with nothing else necessarily affected. In this way, paraconsistent logics are much more adaptable to the real world than classical logic, where upon meeting a contradiction, one would be forced to accept any and all claims whatsoever, and forfeit any hope of rational argument. 

There are a few issues conflated here. First, let's take the example given. The proposition fails, because the "tautology" listed is not actually valid. 

So, the question then becomes: why is "a mechanic or a mercantile life...ignoble and inimical to virtue"? Now, let us examine this a little more closely. By "a mechanic or mercantile life", Aristotle is talking about artisans and tradesmen; in fact, this is a common translation of the passage. And elsewhere in the Politics, Aristotle links artisans and tradesmen with "foreigners", describing them as being only slightly above slaves (1278a). They (artisans, tradesmen, and slaves) are collectively "servants to the community", but are not proper citizens-- which is the point of the main quote above. For Aristotle, citizens (properly constituted) should not be artisans, tradesmen, slaves or farmers-- because they lack the leisure time necessary for the cultivation of "virtue" (ἀρετή), sometimes translated as "excellence." As the linked article indicates, this is a key term for Aristotle-- the focus of his entire Ethics, among other things. So, to close the circle: the point is not that "paid jobs absorb and degrade the mind"; rather, the point is that working too much takes valuable time away from more noble pursuits. Note that Aristotle here is being profoundly (and typically) anti-democratic; in today's terms, he'd be perfectly satisfied that the 99% are working so that the 1% can live a life of leisure, and there's no reason for him that the 99% should be citizens at all-- they are not the people that matter to Aristotle's state. EDIT: Since the question has been updated, I thought I would flesh out my answer a bit, to better match the concerns listed. First, for Aristotle, the nature of the work isn't important-- it doesn't matter to him if you are a farmer, or a tradesman, or a soldier, or a craftsman. All are equally bad, in his opinion, and it has nothing to do with the nature of the work (repetitive or otherwise.) It's purely a function of time. If you are spending your entire day (every day) working, you're not going to have time to cultivate virtue. This leads us to my second point: that any attempt to apply Aristotle's notion to contemporary society is hopelessly anachronistic. Aristotle was writing about a society that was significantly different than ours. The eight-hour day, and the five-day work-week are less than 150 years old. The notion of a liberal education, available to all, regardless of birth, is somewhat older than that, but not by much. The fact that you are able to read this (or anything) already places you far outside of Aristotle's conception of a worker. Aristotle's workers were largely illiterate, extremely uneducated, and had no time to take part in the pursuits of the mind that Aristotle thought were necessary for citizens. The same cannot be said for the working class of today, and even if it were the case, we are (generally) committed to a democratic ideal of citizenship for all that is inimical to Aristotle's views on society. At the same time, the democracy of Aristotle's time was a much more direct democracy, expecting the participation of all citizens in the process of governing (and not just through election of representatives). A nice overview of Aristotle's political theory can be found here. 

The question of time is an incredibly difficult one, which has been treated of philosophers from Aristotle to Heidegger. Thus, it's not something that can be solved in this forum. However, we can say this: time does not exist in the manner in which, say, the book on my table exists. Time is not an entity. Second: we can also say that time is necessarily relational; it requires at least two moments. Third: we can also say that time is deeply entwined with change (or motion), and it doesn't make sense to speak of one without the other. The IEP article on Time provides a good introduction; I suggest you take a look there, and then come back with a narrower question (perhaps based on a single philosopher.)
