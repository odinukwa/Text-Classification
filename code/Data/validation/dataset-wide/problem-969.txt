I can't see there being any physical cause - the water depths are too great for an ice mountain and the feature cross-cuts other geological features. Plus, it's not aligned with either the spreading axis of the mid Atlantic ridge or normal to it. That means that it is highly unlikely to be a fault or a hotspot track. Given that, some sort of processing artifact seems most likely. 

You need to define what you mean by 'adding more sun'. I'm asuming you mean 'increase the solar constant'. The amount of water vapour in the air is, as a first order approximation, related to temperature - every degree of temperature rise gives us 7% more water vapour. So if 'adding more sun' increases the temperature then it automatically increases water vapour. Now, to add more sun without increasing the temperature, you'd have to compensate by doing something like painting large areas of land white; this would increase the Earth's albedo, reflecting the extra solar radiation. No temperature change overall, so no water vapor change. The only direct effect of the sun on water vapor is something entirely different - through photo-dissociation. This is where the sun's UV rays directly break up water molecules. However, in order to have an appreciable effect on the day to day concentration of water vapour, you'd need to replace the Sun with a much bigger and hotter star that blasted out far more UV radiation. The problem here is that everyone would die. So as far as the question can be answered, it would be no under any realistic scenario. 

What you have probably seen in the movies, as used by the oil and gas industry is reflection seismology. This is where you shoot off a sound source (explosives, airguns, etc) and track the reflections of the sound waves from the various rock layers below the surface. At a smaller scale, there is Ground Penetrating Radar, good for a few 10s of meters at best, which is higher resolution and good for detecting voids. 

Pretty confident to answer No here. Tsunamis are caused by water displacement due to earthquakes; this has nothing to do with global warming. Any changes in density would be trivial, and although the water would have more thermal energy, this would not affect or be influenced by the kinetic energy of the Tsunami. The only way in which a tsunami would be made more severe would be that any sea level rise due to global warming would be added to the Tsunami height. 

During an inversion, because air at the surface is not going up, there is no air going down. This means $w\approx0$. With no vertical velocity, the air near the ground is slowed by the drag the ground has on the air, making $\vec{v}\approx0$. This boils the equation down to $$\frac{\partial c}{\partial t}=S_c$$. Since $S_c \ge0$, $c$ will just keep increasing. A good example of a dangerous inversion is the Donora event. 

Well, one side of the earth would heat up, while the other side would not. This would cause a very large thermal gradient, causing extreme wind speeds. Also, you would not have the Coriolis effect, destroying quasi-geostrophic theory. 

Many times, the hottest days occur due to clear skies. Clear skies, generally are associated with areas of high pressure. High pressure areas have a clockwise circulation in the Northern Hemisphere, which brings both warm air and moisture from the Gulf of Mexico. 

Erupting volcanoes release ash. When ash particles collide, it can build a static charge. When that charge is released, there is lightning. 

Yes/no. In a cloud microphysics standpoint, you do need relative humidities greater than 100%, otherwise you cannot form clouds. However, for WRF output, you may want to check the script you are using to compute the dewpoint temperature. You may also want to check to see if you have editted the microphysics code. 

The Rossby radius of deformation tells you the distance when the Coriolis effect becomes just as important as the buoyancy or gravity. Let the Rossby radius of deformation be denoted as $L_R$. According to Holton's Fifth Edition of "An introduction to Dynamic Meteorology," $$L_R=\frac{NH}{f_0}$$ where $N$ is the Brunt-Vaisala frequency, $H$ is the scale height, and $f_0$ is the Coriolis parameter. For phenomena with length scale $L$, buoyancy can be neglected if $L<<L_R$. In statically stable equatorial flows, $$\lim_{f_0\to 0} L_R=\infty$$ In certain coastal flows, $L \approx L_R$ So the author is saying that in equatorial flows, buoyancy can't be neglected, since the Rossby radius "blows up" and for coastal flows $L\approx L_R$ 

The influence of friction decreases Areas of higher wind speed are transported in (yes, the wind blows the wind- that is why it is such a difficult problem) The difference in pressure over a distance increases. Air is trapped to moving along a curve, and the curvature increases (like a spinning ballerina) 

Beginning with the Primitive equations governing atmospheric motion for a dry gas, primarily the ideal gas law, and the conservation of mass and energy, neglecting diffusivity. $$P=\rho R T$$ $$\omega \equiv \frac{DP}{Dt}$$ Therefore $$\omega=R(\rho\frac{DT}{Dt}+T\frac{D\rho}{Dt})$$ Since $$\frac{D\rho}{Dt}=-\rho \nabla\cdot\vec{u}$$ and $$\frac{DT}{Dt}=\frac{\omega\rho}{c_p}+\frac{Q}{c_p}$$ $$\omega=R(\frac{\rho^2\omega}{c_p}+\frac{\rho Q}{c_p}-T\rho\nabla\cdot\vec{u})$$ Distributing $R$ and applying the ideal gas law $$\omega=\frac{R\rho^2\omega}{c_p}+\frac{PQ}{Tc_p}-P\nabla\cdot\vec{u}$$ Separating $\omega$ from the right hand side of the equation yields $$\omega=(1-\frac{R\rho^2}{c_p})^{-1}(\frac{PQ}{Tc_p}-P\nabla\cdot\vec{u})$$ I call this semi-diagnostic, for $\omega$ is still a part of $\nabla\cdot\vec{u}$ Is this a valid semi-diagnostic equation for $\omega$? 

It shows a pattern where the temperatures are dramatically lower where ice sheets have built up relative to today. Interestingly, a lower overall temperature means weaker mixing across latitudes, so some areas are actually warmer. Boston gets chilled by -20 according to the map. Also note the altitude effect. If the surface is raised by 1 kilometer, then due to the lapse rate, the temperature at the new surface will drop by 6.5 degrees. This is a very important factor in stabilizing large ice sheets. 

Let's look at this. A very large number of points for one question. First, the solar system. We do not see any hydrocarbons in the inner solar system (Mercury to Mars). This is because in this region of the solar system, dissociation by solar UV rapidly destroys primordial hydrocarbons. This effect is much weaker further out. Oil well 'replenishment' will happen to some degree over several decades, just from internal migration of oil. Typically only a certain percentage of oil in place is recovered, with the rest left in isolated pockets by the water flood. Give it a few decades and these oil pockets will tend to remigrate and link up, giving the appearance of replenishment. I'm not sure what you comment of The source of methane way too deep to come from fossils. No fossils involved.. That's an unreferenced assertion. Helium is present in Natural Gas as a result of accumulation of alpha-decay particles from radioactive isotopes; we can see this from the massive enrichment of Helium-4 over Helium-3. It's not a paradox; geological structures that can trap methane will also trap helium. The current theory behind petroleum geology is that source rocks with a high organic content (often containing biological hydrocarbons from algae and leaf waxes) are buried in sedimentary basins; at temperatures around 100-150 degrees C this kerogen breaks down to form crude oils (this is verified in the lab). Oil then migrates out of this source rock; if it encounters a trapping geological structure, which need not be sedimentary, then it accumulates as an oil deposit. Gas is similar, with a wider range of source rocks. The physics of how this happens are well known and established. I would also note that we don't see hydrocarbons coming out of mantle-derived volcanoes such as at Hawaii. This is a major problem for any theory of primordial hydrocarbons. Additional Points First, it would be nice if you provided references rather than a link to a book to buy. 

So if you have a mass-mixing ratio, you effectively $\frac{ \text{kg pollutant}}{\text{kg dry air}}$. PPBV is parts per billion volume, or number of molecules of pollutant per billion molecules of dry air. Since not all particles weigh the same, you must use a conversion factor. Consider molar mass, which is the ratio of moles (a unit describing the number of molecules/photons/atoms) to mass. Ozone has a molar mass of 48 kg mol$^{-1}$. Dry air doesn't have a molar mass per se, but an effective molar mass may be computed by a weighted sum of the molar masses of the consitituent chemicals (or you can Google it). Afterwards, you may have to multiply by a billion.$$\therefore \frac{ \text{kg pollutant}}{\text{kg dry air}} \times\frac{\frac{\text{mols of pollutant}}{\text{kg of pollutant}}}{\frac{\text{mols of dry air}}{\text{kg of dry air}}}=\frac{\text{mols of pollutant}}{\text{mols of dry air}}$$ 

If there is a quantity that varies in the atmosphere, there is inherently a gradient. Since you know there is a pressure and temperature gradient, there must also be a density gradient. There is also wind speed gradients, buoyancy gradients, wind shear gradients, isentropic gradients, vorticity gradients etc. let $\chi$ be a scalar quantity with the diagnostic equation: $$\frac{\partial \chi}{\partial t}+\vec{v}\cdot \nabla \chi=F(x,y,z,t)$$, where $\vec{v}$ is the wind vector, and $F$ is the forcing term (source-sink) Therefore $$\nabla \frac{\partial \chi}{\partial t}=\frac{\partial \nabla\chi}{\partial t} $$ and $$\frac{\partial \nabla\chi}{\partial t}+\nabla \vec{v}\cdot\nabla\chi+\vec{v}\cdot\nabla(\nabla\chi)=\nabla F(x,y,z,t)$$ Therefore changes in the gradient of a quantity is dependent on the changes of the advection of the quantity and the changes in the forcing of the quantity. For example, an advancing cold front (effectively a moving thermal gradient) can be strengthened if the cold side is cooled/warm side is warmed, or the spacing decreases. 

Get a shapefile of the borders and use Python to create a polygon of the borders. Use mpl_toolkits to convert the climate model to X and Y coordinates Check to see if the model grid points are within the Polygon 

In addition to the rarity, there is also the problem of additional computations. To find out if there is a solar eclipse, you need extra calculations. Since the introduction of additional calculations can slow down the model, especially since radiation is oft quoted as the most expensive physics parameterization, introduction of the astronomy may provide unnecessary calculations. A solar eclipse, while influential, is only influential in the short term, so it is often ignored. Even then, the data assimilation methods can correct for any error after the eclipse (though that would be an interesting project). Plus there is also the complication of clouds, etc. Any forecaster who pays attention to the news knows about the eclipse. Any forecaster who knows the inner workings of models (though many don't) should know that eclipses are ignored in radiation parameterizations. So forecasters should know that it will impact their forecast, but by how much, was uncertain. There are things that are ignored in weather models, but we know we ignore them. We ignore them because the are small, difficult to moddel, poorly understood, etc. Such things include aerosols, tropospheric chemistry, tornadoes, heating from lightning, anthropogenic heat flux, drag from buildings.
