To allow a given direction in thought to be followed long enough to receive a fair test. From a modern theory of perception, we learn about the environment by making guesses about it and confronting reality with them. If we had only reactive thoughts, and no beliefs, we could not use this style of learning. A given guess has to be remembered and held to long enough that the corresponding support or disproof can be correlated with the guess. And the longer a guess holds out against disproof, the more likely it is to be true, at least on a certain scale. If you are a monkey guessing the apple you are looking at is ripe, the more seconds this impression survives, while you take a few looks from different angles, none of which detect any green on it, the more likely the apple is to actually be ripe. Unfortunately, we tend to think that means it is true on every scale, which makes longstanding cultural beliefs hard to modify when they ultimately don't fit reality. 

There is a distinction between a sound argument and a valid one. A sound argument actually proves something. A valid argument may not. Instead, a valid argument preserves the truth of its premises. The idea behind focussing on valid arguments in most logic is that any valid argument could be applied to a wholly different set of premises similar to the actual ones (in both form and truth value). And if those other premises were true, each set would produce a sound argument. So a valid argument can produce a number of different sound proofs. It is, therefore, more useful. But if there is no truth in the premises, then absolutely any argument preserves 'all' of that nonexistent truth. So if your premises are false, your argument is always valid. If your premises contradict, so that they cannot all be true, because if some of them are true, others would not be, then, taken together they are false. So your argument is valid. 

I don't think there is a uniform answer, if you have any value beyond 'joy'. I think the ultimate way to choose between things that affect all of humanity, is to determine the effect of a change on our future, not on our 'joy'. And our needs cause us to serve various purposes to the world. For instance, a world without sex would lack more than the fulfillment of sex -- It would stop natural evolution and take away part of our family bonding, and I think those would be losses. On the other hand, not having to eat could be a positive thing. (Especially if you could taste things without consuming them -- your question did not rule out joy without need.) It would separate some aspects of our survival from a drain on the resources of the planet, and allow for a more sustainable world. 

The author has already explicitly taken a technical definition of 'persuade' that excludes emotion or other irrational psychological response: "an argument is a piece of reasoning in which one or more statements are offered as support for some Other statement." Feeling happy for someone, taken advantage of, angry or sympathetic, for instance, are not statements, and attempts to manage them are not arguments. Such a definition is common in logic texts, but not warranted, and I consider it incorrect, but he has just stated that this is his position. From that perspective, then, attempts to persuade us to have a logical reaction and not an emotional one are never 'arguments'. Take one case, 'complaint', the others are parallel. A complaint that contains an argument that is supposed to motivate you to respond constructively rather than emotionally does not 'persuade' in this sense. It only argues for or against a sheerly emotional reaction to the difficulty at hand: disappointment, or the lack thereof; which is not a statement. Stripped of the emotional trigger that makes the embedded argument necessary, the remaining statement of disapproval is no longer persuasive in the accepted sense. Even if it might change your behavior, it will not do so on the basis of the logic accepted here, but out of social motivations driven by emotion. So, from this perspective, there are two entirely separate things in the most common form of a complaint: the complaint proper, and an attempt at persuasion to take a different action than the one being complained about. The former is not an argument, even if the latter is. 

The central notion of Kuhn is that of 'normal science', that the goal of a paradigm was actually to reduce the practice of science to a kind of stability that allowed its primary work to be solving technical puzzles that could be stated in ways accepted by the entire community. If this is what most scientists do most of the time, what happens between periods of such stability? Historically, what happens in those periods between convergent puzzle-solving looks much more like politics or religion than like logical argumentation. Appeals to intuition abound, and formulations gather adherents, rather than data. So he characterized science as alternating between these two extremes. In each extreme, the notion of what failure means is completely different. In both cases it has something in common with Popper's idea that theories exist to be challenged, but in neither case do successful challenges actually cause theories to be abandoned. During normal science, the not-yet-covered part of the domain is constantly predicted wrongly by the theory at hand, and yet the theory remains largely intact, making finer elaborations or very small adaptations. Faith exists that some minor change in perspective, some intricate refolding of existing work, or some unaccounted fact will explain the failure. So falsification is continual -- and irrelevant. Between periods, when new sets of groundwork are being proposed, each set acknowledges its own incompleteness, so it purposely does not try to cover large chunks of the domain that it knows it is not fit for. So falsification remains unattempted -- and irrelevant. The point at which falsification matters is late in a 'revolution' as a paradigm comes together. And its primary application is to make sure the paradigm does not so thoroughly foreclose the imagination that those proposing it could never be made to abandon it. It is a challenge of the imagination that prevents the ascendance of overly-philosophical attempts at science like Alchemy or Freudianism, which are so flexible they cannot be challenged, and will occupy much more time in ascendency than they deserve, in a counterproductive manner that hinders overall progress. So although Popper has identified something extremely important, from a Kuhnian point of view, it is not useable most of the time, and surely does not apply to each individual observation in the way its originator imagined it should. Given the ascendency of statistics, with the habitual framing of he null-hypothesis, it is easier for us to imagine or pretend that we are producing science with the intention of challenging it continually. But even though we inject it at the very base of our consideration, this is actually not true at any important level. We still take overall theories that frame our experiments as whole systems of belief, which we do not set aside for lack of support. When a researcher finds lack of support for an accepted paradigm, it is very seldom the paradigm, and much more often the researcher who is declared to have failed. 

I know this is from the opposite end of the earth, but sometimes the best perspective is from a distance... It might also be outright foolishness. This kind of problem immediately faces feminist-affected men, and it is a central problem for religions that are traditionally pacifist, like Quakerism. It is also a central issue in the deep, core misunderstanding of people like Nietzsche. To tie it to language is an oversimplification, but this is the cleanest way to express it: There is a triple notion of 'rule' in our world, that runs very, very deep. Rule (as in the rule of law) is what maintains order and safety; rules are what determines moves in a game; and rules are what produce predictable outcomes. A lot of the problem with Warring Culture, as seen from this perspective is that these three get used in a vicious circle. We uphold rules that are just moves in a game on the rationale that they are what maintain order and safety, because we can demonstrate that they have predictable outcomes. And we then think we have said something about 'rules'. Institutions like the ManKind Project take it as a part of their focus to break apart the latter two. Men (and many women, but not as many) easily become deeply invested in rules that do not serve them. For instance they try to replace empathetic and intuitive notions in their ethics with 'unwritten rules'. They will fight tooth-and-nail to uphold the rules of their culture even when those rules do not, in general, serve the interests of those who follow them. The sense of safety and order seduces them away from the stated goals and outcomes, and they strain pointlessly to re-attach those by appealing to the 'rules of the game'. A 'Warrior culture' (They call themselves New Warriors) from that point of view (or a Self-serving culture in the sense of pacifist feminists like Starhawk) should be one that aggressively seeks out what works, and not one that wishes to take a predetermined model and enforce it on situations where it may or may not work, but will give comfort to others. Pacifists religions in particular are paranoid of being co-opted by charismatic leadership. They seek 'Anarchy' in the positive sense, and they do not wish to be pushed in directions that mistake predictable outcomes for actual effectiveness. From their point of view your 'Warring culture' consistently mistakes domination for getting what they actually want. (Well for Quakers it is what 'The Light' actually wants. But, psychology and religion being different words for the same thing...) In that same vein, feminism accuses the male attachment to rules, with violence as a way of enforcing them, of creating a 'protection racket' where tons of energy goes into control in the name of peace, but in a way that actively undermines existing peace, while it elevates those capable of violence. Our basic inability to take Nietzsche seriously without feeding it fascists is rooted in the same problem. He is encouraging finding and leveraging power as the right thing to do. But he considers violence to be a vastly inferior form of power, sometimes necessary, but completely unforgivable when used when anything subtler would work. At one hilarious extreme he applies his notion even to music, ragging on Wagner for using the orchestra to do violence in place of more subtle ways of manipulating emotion. And then a large number of people who consider themselves his devotees basically encourage taking violence seriously as an option more often. 

The main 'problem' with (non-transfinite) induction is that the proof itself that would cover all the numbers is not completed in a finite length unless one includes a rule that is implicitly infinitely long. The proof via induction sets up a program that reduces each step to a previous one, which means that the actual proof for any given case n is roughly n times the length of the stated proof. The total proof, to cover all cases is then implicitly infinite in length. But for any case that comes to hand, we could do the scutwork and spit out a proof that is still finite. So does a collection of infinitely many finite proofs count as a proof? Well, that depends on why on earth you think there is an infinite set of proofs to begin with. Either you think there is a complete, infinite set of integers, or you don't. Either way, induction it true, but it is true for a different reason in each case. In Classical mathematics, the question seems very stark: you either need the 'induction schema' which is either second-order, and thus potentially self-referential, or has infinitely many entries. But this is because classical mathematics is not 'constructive', it always models time by taking up space, by creating copies of objects, rather than by taking up time. If you need something to be true of any integer, but your statement systematically differs from integer to integer, so that there is not a single closed form that captures it, then you have to make infinitely many copies of it, and modify each copy. This makes induction seem strange. But it all takes care of itself. If you think the set of numbers exist, there is no reason why your infinite set of axioms should not exist, one for each number. From a constructivist point of view, mathematics should be represented not by true statements but by iterative constructions. A proof should be a program that runs on inputs and verifies that an assertion can be reduced to agreed principles. Then every proof shares that form with an induction. We very seldom ever write out a proof proceeding entirely from axioms one step at a time. Instead, we invoke principles and forms that indirectly indicate how the 'real underlying' proof would be assembled. And selecting a number does not require embodying the set of all numbers so that you can then choose one. It just means what it says, if I counted up to someplace and just stopped anywhere, I would have chosen an arbitrary integer without vouching for the existence of a set of all integers. Our notions of infinite sets are just tricks of language, not depictions of infinite objects. So issues of infinities do not have to enter into the consideration here. You only need to accept that iteration is a reasonable thing to do. You can do that within your definition of what a construction is, and therefore within the definition of what it means to prove something. In that case, you do not need an infinite axiom base to support proofs with loops. For Kleene, a proof is a recursive function that computes a truth value, for Bishop it is an iterative process that validates an assertion. Both of these automatically include induction as a natural form of proof. Beyond this, there are extreme forms of objection to repetition. The idea that there is a natural limit on the human ability to keep track of things and that we should not allow arbitrarily long processes into our plans. This reaction arises quite naturally in the proof of the 4-color theorem, where there are over a thousand separate cases, and each case is an algorithm that reduces a complex structure to one of the earlier cases. It is a proof that no human could ever possibly comprehend, and our faith in it relies upon our understanding of the engineering process that selected those cases and automatically wrote those algorithms through brute force enumeration. It makes one worry. But in such a framework no general mathematical truth is ever really true. A notion like the idea of induction is impossible to state, and so is a simple theorem like the idea all maps can be painted in four colors. There are surely maps too complex for a human to paint them, so surely there is no way of knowing about that. To me, this is nonsense. We have invented computers, and they collectively manage exobytes of information. We have more than enough power to handle mathematical truths far beyond any individual's or group's ability to fully comprehend them, and yet we don't doubt that we can enforce the rules that handle that information. This philosophy has to just crumble under observed reality.
