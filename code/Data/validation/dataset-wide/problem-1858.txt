Possibly, yes. The question I'd have is how mature are the people and processes at the company for handling bringing in new hires? Many places would expect the new hire to "jump in" and learn the stuff on their own without supervision, I'd expect. I'd suspect 80-90% of job descriptions I see will have, "work well with minimal supervision," which is part of what is being asked here is that supervision to bring someone up to speed. If the company is mature then there should be a contact to assist if there is a question or desire to know more than what reading the documentation, tests, and source code has. However, there is something to be said for what work is being done and what would be useful as if the main application has tens of thousands of lines of code then an overview may not be useful if one is fixing minor functional bugs that don't correspond with an overall tone of the code. Something to consider is how well is he phrasing this request. Is he conveying a sense of entitlement that everyone is to bend over backwards to spoon feed him? Is he being specific enough in the request for assistance that it can be met? I suspect this is the type of communication expectation that will happen repeatedly if he isn't prepared to be accurate and precise in these requests. "Baptism by fire" would be a typical situation I'd expect as developers are expected to know how to learn what is needed and use that to solve a problem and move forward. Figuring things out on one's own is part of this process that is rather natural, at least to my mind and in most of the cases I've had in my 13 years of work. 

You could ask for an update and if there was any feedback on the interview. That would be my suggestion for phrasing it, especially if the initial interview was more than a week ago. The tone I would aim is that, "Hey, I was wondering if you had some news for me..." so that it is just a bit of a general message wondering if there is anything new. If the interview was a day or two ago, I would wait another week before sending this e-mail as you want there to be enough time that you waited patiently in a sense. 

Yes, you would be responding to the last e-mail in the chain so that she knows what this would be in regards to you asking. If you feel it necessary you could say, "We are 2/3rds through November now and I just wondered if you could give me an update here," though some may see that as being a bit analytical in the e-mail. 

Succession planning comes to mind where one may have someone be a "Number 2" so that if the manager or lead is away, this is who would step in to take their place. The theory here would be to ensure continuity of the work of the team should something happen to the lead or manager. Command and Control management styles may work within this framework. High Potential employees may be found and then elevated to see how they handle being given more responsibility or power. If someone appears to have management potential, there may be tests done with various projects to confirm how well this works or not. Office Space would be a film that employed some ideas here as the guy that did little work was promoted while the real workers were fired. Funny film with some points that are rather interesting. While the film is a bit old since it references Y2K, there are some interesting ideas to the film about how people operate in the workplace. Peter Principle would be another idea here to consider where some people that are good at their jobs will be promoted until this isn't the case. 

I'd likely ask in the interview as sometimes the key with those questions is to see what will be asked and what will be assumed. How do you ask if you have a question? How do you handle ambiguity that may pop up? This is often the key behind some of these things. In reality, there could be various answers to the question which is why seeking clarity is important. 

If you state it as you don't want to review others then I'd likely think it would work against you. However, if you want to go down a technical career progression then it may be that you wouldn't be doing as much reviewing of other's work though you may still get pulled into 360 assessments or other forms where peers review each other on a team. If you choose to perfect your technical skills then you may be able to get away without doing as much paperwork as managers though I'd think there is something to be said for how you view your co-workers and sometimes expressing some of that once in a while. 

Realistically, there are a couple of possibilities here to my mind noting that I'm not a mental health professional though I am a Software Developer that does have mental health issues: 

So, you have no regrets in your life? Think about if there is someone that you wanted to have some more time and would have apologized if you had the time. While this isn't precisely what is asked, it can provide a reasonable answer. "At my mother's funeral, I realized that there were some times I did things as a child and wanted to apologize but it was now too late to do that," could be a suitable answer to the question, where you could use grandparents or other relatives as an idea, as part of the point here is to see how you answer rather than just what you say. If you want to say that you are overly apologetic that may backfire as you could then come across as weak in a sense. At least that would be how I could see this going. 

Just to give my background here, I work in a post-secondary educational institution where there are various departments that can cover pieces of this. There are people within the department that would handle basic office supplies, facilities management is a separate group for the cases of desks and shelves, and then there is an IT department that can be for other stuff in some cases. Depending on the issue, I would refer if another department would be better to handle the request or if not then I'd try to do it myself. Part of being in IT can mean that a lot of calls come to you and somewhere in the process is the idea of passing along the message that, "The company may be better served by having other staff handle these kinds of requests," though this has to be stated rather diplomatically and with tact. 

What is the value for the interviewer in knowing that you did these other projects at this point? I can see this being similar to the person that gets a couple of questions wrong on the exam and then wants to tell the teacher, "I know this after all. Here are the answers..." which does very little for the teacher as the test is over and things have moved forward. I'd suggest letting this go for this company and remember for future interviews. Otherwise you may come across as the developer that can't let things go which can be a rather unattractive quality as there may be bugs that won't get fixed and other issues that you have to remember your priorities in the job. 

The recruiter may have had some issues either health, personal or family that caused her to be out of the office for a few days. While this is highly unlikely, perhaps aliens came and abducted for the next few months. Perhaps she has gotten a nasty infection and has been in the hospital for a few days. Perhaps someone in her family has had a health emergency and she is away for a while. 

The key here is to use what bits you do have along with what would seem reasonable to ask, at least that is how I see this. Asking the person about their background in terms of how long they have worked for this company and what kinds of experiences they have are very reasonable questions that may not apply in other circumstances, e.g. if you meet a stranger in a bar these ideas aren't applicable. The location point can be a bit of an icebreaker as well as letting it be vague enough that many different areas could be used in an answer,e.g. changes in weather, time zone differences, culture, etc. Another point here is how long of a conversation is expected. If the manager is doing general introductions, then spending only 1-2 minutes may well be the right amount of time to converse. On the other hand, if something longer is needed then consider some open-ended questions that may help in general socializing.
