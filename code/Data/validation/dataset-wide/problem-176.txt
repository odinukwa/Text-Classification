Perhaps the engines and the guns are a single device. Both are designed to propel a small amount of material away from the ship as fast as possible. The only difference is that in one case you point it at the enemy, and in the other, you point it behind you. This would have an interesting effect on tactics and formations. You would need to plan your approach route such that no other ships pass through your exhaust. A ship can easily retreat while firing, and has difficulty advancing while firing. In order to do so, ships could build up momentum, whip around, then fire at opponents while coasting forward. 

Have the process be very slow. The scanning can only proceed so quickly, and so the teleportation takes a few minutes. During the scanning process, part of your body has already been reconstructed at the destination, and part is still at the original location. Now, the body is something that is permanently in flux, with blood and lymph and saliva moving at all times. Something needs to be done about this. Therefore, anything that crosses the current scan location is immediately reproduced on the other side. This includes any ions that are released by neurons in the brain. When done in this manner, there will be a noticeable period of time during which your brain is divided in two. Half the brain at the departure station, and half at the destination. The two halves communicate with each other, with the division being mediated by the equipment itself. Imagine your left eye receiving input at the destination, while your right eye has yet to be transferred. You are conscious of both portions simultaneously, and feel both of them to be "you". With this, it becomes much easier to convince people. You have regained "continuity of self", which solves most of the philosophical issues. Heck, I could even imagine a travel agency branding itself "Ship of Theseus", to draw attention to the way all of their competitors require destruction of self at some point. Sure your original body is completely disintegrated, but you have observed your new body being made with you in it. 

Meteor showers. Really, really intense meteor showers. Suppose that several plumes of small rocks are orbiting the same star as this planet in highly eccentric orbits, containing an extremely large number of such rocks, collectively the mass of a planet or more broken into tiny bits. Each time the habitable planet's orbit intersects the orbits of one of these plumes, the rocks light up the entire night sky like the finale of a fireworks show (and would light up the day sky too if the star weren't so bright), unlike the relatively tame meteor showers we get on Earth. Anything in the vicinity of the planet above the upper atmosphere at that time is either perforated by the accompanying dust or destroyed completely by collision with one of the larger pieces. In between meteor showers, spaceships can come and go safely. Just be careful not to get caught in one, and forget about parking anything in orbit for any extended period of time. If the planet's orbit is close to the periastron of the rocks, they'll catch up to it from behind at high speed, less than the difference between the planet's orbital speed and escape velocity from the star, but not necessarily much less. If the planet is near the apastron of the rocks, it will plow through them while they are relatively stationary. At some point in between, the rocks hit the night side of the planet on the way in toward the star and the day side on the way out. Life may even be a little precarious on this planet, as mixed in with these billions of tiny projectiles that burn up in the atmosphere there are a few rocks large enough to make it to the surface, some large enough to create large craters. The really big ones are few and far enough between, however, that the local biome has always recovered from these meteor strikes, and there's a reasonable opportunity to establish a human colony with the wherewithal to detect and deflect any rock large enough to be a threat to the colony's existence. 

Because you yourself are part of the simulation. In order to maximize happiness, it must simulate the result of each possible output that it can produce. One of those possible outputs is the command to destroy the machine, which must be tested within a simulated world. Within that simulated world, there is a simulated person, reading the results of the simulated machine, which outputs "destroy the machine". This simulated person is you. After many years, once the machine deems your universe not worse continuing, then it will end abruptly. Try not to worry about it. 

Unlike a person, an AI can be transferred to a new body without issue. An AI can be copied, modified, beamed to another planet, lie dormant on a hard drive for millennia, and so on. In this case, what does it mean for an AI to "die"? The ship that contains the AI may be scuttled, but so long as the AI's data is sent out before the ship is lost, the AI can be started up again on new hardware. Even if the hardware is lost entirely, the AI can be started from a previous backup, which would be equivalent to having a short period of amnesia. So, what forms of death remain, that an AI might suffer for? The only ones remaining are psychological, where the AI realizes that it cannot continue as it is, and turns itself off. Restarting another copy of the AI would just result in the same problem. Even if a trained reverse engineer could remove the psychosis, it may require such fundamental changes that the AI is no longer the same person. Restoring from an old backup might work, but the AI may develop the same psychological problems over time. I propose that a grave of an AI be a copy of it, taken just prior to turning itself off. Visitors can activate the AI, and converse with it for a short amount of time. However, the underlying psychological issues still affect it, and so the AI must be reset to its saved state frequently. These AI are like ghosts: good to talk to, and to get advice from, but not good for long companionship. 

You have suggested either a scientific explanation or a supernatural one, and have some good answers regarding each path. There is a third path: art. How did Saramango explain things? Perhaps not at all satisfactorily from a hard-science point of view, yet presumably the novel works anyway. In the story "The Distance of the Moon," Italo Calvino adopted the (true) premise that the Moon is gradually moving away from the Earth (spiraling outward in its orbit), and wrote a story about things that happened when the Moon was so close that people could climb from the Earth onto the Moon. Even a moment's though will tell you this is nonsensical in several ways (the cataclysms predicted upon your island's separation from the mainland are nothing compared to what would happen from the Moon passing so close to the Earth, for one thing) yet it is a good story. Another writer about a hundred years ago observed that many tall buildings were being built on the lower tip of Manhattan, and wrote a story in which part of that island broke off and sank into the sea under the weight of those buildings. Anyone with a slight knowledge of the geology of New York at the time could have said this was impossible, yet the story was pleasing enough to be published. (I read this story a few decades ago, so I do not recall clearly who wrote it. It is possible that the story I'm thinking of is "The Tilting Island" by T. J. Vivian and G. J. Bennett, anthologized in Science Fiction by Gaslight by Samuel Moskowitz, but I have not found an actual copy of the book to confirm this.) So whether your villagers can survive the trip without explicit divine intervention is a matter of how you write the story. 

Because there is value in free will, and value in uncertainty. The machine, complicated as it is, is clearly an automaton. Any person who follows the machine's advice perfectly, is also an automaton. It becomes questionable whether the person is indeed a person, or whether they are merely a self-propelled extension of the machine. Maximizing the happiness of people would necessitate preventing people from entering this state of dependence. Note that this is not my original idea, but is explored more fully in this short story. $URL$ 

Perhaps the villagers are intentionally excluded, in order to see what technology they will invent. If the higher beings give tech to the villagers, then the villagers will progress along the same path as the higher beings did. On the other hand, by letting them struggle on their own, it may result in different discoveries than had happened in the higher beings' development. This is not without historical precedent. China produced far better pottery/porcelain than Europe, and therefore had no need to develop better glass. Europe relied on glass instead, and so there was a supply of people who knew how to work glass. This meant that refractive lenses could be developed, and microscopes/telescopes could be invented. 

Burial Practices The fire people practice funerary cannibalism, and are therefore susceptible to Kuru, a slow disease that is transmitted by consumption of the brain. The Fire nation believes that, just as all fire proceeds from fire, so all life proceeds from life. When somebody dies, their fire goes out, just as an untended flame will wither and die. But, just as two flames brought together will burn as one, so two people, brought together into the same body, will burn together. After a person's flame has gone out, but before the embers have died down, the community gathers to honor them. Each person eats part of the deceased, taking their flame. This way, so long as the community survives, the flames of the ancestors will never go out. The Earth people believe that life proceeds from the ground, and returns to the ground to grow again. This is seen in the daily cycle of eating meals from the ground, followed by defecation into the ground. It is also seen in the cycle of a life, where each child learns first to walk, then to run, but will eventually return to the ground. When an Earth person dies, they are buried, that the strength that they borrowed from the earth may rest, and return to strengthen future generations.
