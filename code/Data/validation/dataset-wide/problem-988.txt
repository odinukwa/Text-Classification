You need a radiative transfer model and global climate model to do it with greenhouse gases. you can derive the temperature without greenhouse gases as discussed below: The absorption is highly variable depending on wavelength and can be seen in this graphic: 

I am familiar with the concept of cloud seeding, where precipitation can be induced with aerosols, thereby altering storm intensity further downwind. Are there methods that could be used to drastically alter storm wind intensity or storm direction? What technology could theoretically be developed in the future that used satellites, ocean networks, balloons, or other devices to curb strong winds (e.g. tornadoes or hurricanes) so that populated areas could be protected. Or is a strong storm simply too large scale of an event to be altered significantly by humans? 

Another common practice is for government owned lands to have prescribed fire put to the ground, which simulates natural conditions and removes invasive species (e.g. on rangelands). When field burning or broadcast prescribed burns are not possible, pile burns are conducted (e.g. piles from timber slash, orchard tear-outs, mixed brush, etc.). Pile burns ensure that the fire does not go wild and that there is enough heat flux to allow the smoke plume to break through a temperature inversion. So, while North America does not typically employ "slash and burn" nomenclature, there is certainly a lot of slash being burned.

You do not need another Bachelor's degree. After graduating with a bachelors degree in natural science, I taught high school for three years, and then went to graduate school to study air quality in an environmental engineering program. Many students in my group studied air quality / climate change interactions and climate change was a significant part of our class curriculum. If you have good computer skills and a good academic record, then you should have no problem finding a university that will fund you to do Master's work in climate-related environmental sciences. Universities need graduate students because they perform a fundamental duty (e.g. teaching or researching) at a low cost compared to a professor or post-doc. However, you should keep in mind that after you graduate, you may not be able to find a job doing what you want in climate-science, unless you are prepared to write funding proposals. Climate change is a vast field which is not all about the atmosphere. Biology plays a significant role. I would suggest you try to get involved with climate-related marine biology, changes in ecosystems due to climate change, or the effects that increased carbon/temperature have on plants/animals. Though, jumping into atmospheric science as your primary area of study will put you at a competitive disadvantage since many graduate students will have studied that in their Bachelor's program. As for a book, I suggest you read David MacKay's "Sustainable Energy, without the hot air", and I also suggest you familiarize yourself with the IPCC reports and Global Carbon Project. 

Check out this beta data portal from the Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies / University of Wisconsin-Madison CIMSS Tropical Cyclones Data Archive $URL$ . However, my favorite source of information is the Regional and Mesoscale Meteorology Branch (RAMMB) of NOAA/NESDIS $URL$ And there are good summaries here: $URL$ and another good general source of information is from the National Hurricane Center $URL$ 

No, you shouldn't really do that. A vertical column density (VCD) retrieval provides the user with a representation of the total number of molecules over some vertical slice (e.g. the entire troposphere). A mixing ratio, often defined in parts per million, is meant to express the average number of molecules in a parcel of air. The problem with converting VCD to ppm is that the troposphere is a whole lot more than "a parcel of air". The density of air and mixing ratio of NO2 changes as you move vertically through the atmosphere. So, saying that NO2 has any one mixing ratio through the troposphere is really not appropriate. There are methods you could use to estimate ppm NO2 from VCD (such as inferring mixing ratio from the shape of the a priori profile), but they would be inherently uncertain for many reasons: 

If you see wikipedia here: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_internal_heat_budget They have a nice summary of the answer I think you are looking for: 

Seasons are determined by the degree of tilt of the planet's axis, not the mass of the atmosphere. Mars has an axial tilt slightly larger than Earth, so Mars' seasons are slightly more pronounced than Earth's. For a planet like Venus, which has virtually no rotation and an extreme axial tilt, "seasons" are also affected by the rotation/revolution ratio. If you are interested in the climate differences between separate planets, mass of the atmosphere does affect overall global temperature (e.g. more atmospheric mass = more heat trapping) but the mass itself is not the main driver of the dynamic changes of climate within an individual atmosphere. Really Mars and Venus don't have as much "short term" climate dynamics like Earth, because they don't have ocean/land dynamics. Though, they definitely have seasons. Earth's "short term" climate dynamics are driven by the heterogeneous distribution of land, ocean, and (to a smaller extent) clouds. All the planets do share similar long term drivers of climate dynamics, which on Earth are collectively known as the Malenkovitch cycles. The Malenkovich cycles are on the order of 10s of thousands of years and include changes in axial tilt, axial precession, and orbital eccentricity. Some would also argue that long term gravitational changes in orbit parameters due to trojan asteroids and large planets like Jupiter also affect the Malenkovitch cycles. These cycles shift the timing, intensity, and spatial distribution of solar input to the planet. 

As a USA resident, the EPA is the best place to start when wondering about the emissions inventory of atmospheric pollutants or pollutant precursors that affect the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (e.g. Particulate Matter, Carbon Monoxide, Sulfur Dioxide, Lead, Nitrogen Oxides, Volatile Organic Compounds). The EPA compiles a comprehensive emissions inventory of all criteria pollutants at the county level which is available in the National Emissions Inventory (compiled once every 3 years). You can see the summary of your county at $URL$ As for the effects of atmospheric pollution, it is important to consider the lifetime of said pollutants in the atmosphere in order to put their environmental impacts into perspective. For instance, the air pollutants covered by the National Ambient Air Quality Standards have immediate health effects when high concentrations are breathed in regularly. Both animals and plants are adversely affected by these irritating and sometimes toxic chemicals, but these pollutants are also reactive and do not last long in the atmosphere unless they are constantly being replenished (e.g. daily traffic). Air quality also impacts critical nitrogen loads on ecosystems and possible production of acid rain. If you are interested in Greenhouse Gases (e.g. methane, carbon dioxide, CFCs, nitrous oxide), the EPA has a separate site for those emissions since they are not part of the same regulatory framework $URL$ . Greenhouse gases typically do not cause adverse health effects for plants or animals on land. However, they have long-term radiative effects (e.g. the greenhouse effect) because they stay in the atmosphere for many years and trap infrared light. These long-term radiative effects are what can change climate and consequently land cover. Furthermore, most of the excess carbon is absorbed by the ocean, which creates carbonic acid. Increased acidity of the ocean causes severe problems for marine ecosystems. The EPA states that in 2012 the CO2 equivalent GHG emissions for the USA by sector was: 

Most meteoroids burn up in the atmosphere, so they don't impact the Earth's surface. Factors that seem important include: 

This is great news if it actually works out. However, how much garbage will still be retained at the sea floor (or suspended below the level at which the garbage can be removed)? 

You can use a program called Stella (which costs money) but there is also a free program that does nearly the same thing called Vensim. These software packages allow you to build simple dynamic models using a GUI interface. The materials (including salmon run scenario model files) for Andy Ford's "Modeling the Environment" class, which he taught for many years, are here: $URL$ with the "Smolts Migration Model" and "Salmon Harvest Simulator" prebuilt. His text can be obtained online, the title is "Modeling the Environment: An Introduction To System Dynamics Modeling Of Environmental Systems"
