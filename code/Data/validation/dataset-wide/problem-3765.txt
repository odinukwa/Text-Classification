It's well-known, due to work of Fontaine (see e.g. this), that if $k$ is a perfect field of characteristic $p$, then one can classify $p$-divisible groups over $W(k)$ by Honda systems. Namely, these are pairs $(L,D)$ where $D$ is a Dieudonne-module over $k$ (free as a $W(k)$-module) and a sub $W(k)$-module $L$ such that composition $L\to W(k)/FW(k)$ induces an isomorphism $L/pL\to W(k)/FW(k)$. I have always interpreted this in the following way. A $p$-divisible group $G$ over $\text{Spec}(W(k))$ is (by algebraizability) a $p$-divisible group over $\text{Spf}(W(k))$. One can interpret such data as a $p$-divisible group $G_0$ over $k$ and, thanks to Grothendieck-Messing, a submodule $L_n\subseteq D(G_0)(W_n(k))$ for each $n$, where $L_n$ is required to be free, and to be 'admissible' (in the sense that $L_n/p L_n$ is supposed to be $\omega_{G_0^\vee}$ (note that I'm using, to be consistent with Messing, covariant Dieudonne theory). Of course such data needs to be compatible in $n$. It seems to me that one recovers precisely the notion of Honda systems by taking this system and taking the limit. Thus, one seems to recover the classification of $p$-divisible groups over $W(k)$ from Grothendieck-Messing. But, as far as I can tell, the approach that people usually take to the equality between Honda systems and $p$-divisible groups is via (the admittedly more concrete) approach of Fontaine using the logarithm map. It seems strange to me that if one can recover this interpretation of the Honda system classification of $p$-divisible groups over $W(k)$ that it wouldn't be mentioned in the above article of B. Conrad. Also brief searches in google with the key words "Grothendieck-Messing" and "Honda systems" turn up nought. Is there some subtlety that I'm missing, or does the above actually explain the classification of $p$-divisible groups over $W(k)$ by Honda systems. Thanks! EDIT: User nfdc23 states below that one does obtain this classification of $p$-divisible groups over $W(k)$, but it is not so obvious that it mathces, on the nose, Fontaine's classification. Namely, if $L\subseteq D(G_0)(W(k))$ is the admissible submodule from Grothendieck-Messing is it true that $L$ is the kernel logarithm map from Fontaine's work? I will think on this, but if anyone has a quick answer, I'd love to hear it! 

Is it true that the number of Plücker relations for a Grassmannian $Gr(k,n)$ is equal to the dimension $k(n-k)$ of said Grassmannian? So far, for $Gr(2,5)$, I get exactly five Plücker relations: $$p_{12}p_{34}+ p_{23}p_{14}- p_{13}p_{24}=0,$$ $$p_{12}p_{35}+p_{23}p_{15}- p_{13}p_{25}=0,$$ $$p_{12}p_{45}+p_{24}p_{15}- p_{14}p_{25}=0,$$ $$p_{13}p_{45}+p_{34}p_{15}- p_{14}p_{35}=0,$$ $$p_{23}p_{45}+p_{34}p_{25}- p_{24}p_{35}=0.$$ I'm not sure, but I think that three of the above relations are algebraically independent, no? Are there supposed to be six Plücker relations for $Gr(2,5)$? 

I've gone through many texts in algebraic geometry, specifically, Schubert calculus. They all claim that the Schubert classes $[\Omega_{\lambda}]$ form a basis for the cohomology ring of the complex Grassmannian of $k$-dimensional subspaces of $n$-dimensional complex space, i.e. $H^{*}(Gr(k, n))$, but without any proof. I would think that there could be a way to somehow show this result using an argument involving linear independence and span, but I'm not sure where to begin. In the back of Fulton's $\textit{Young tableaux}$, it is suggested to construct a filtration $$Gr(k, n)=Y_0 \supset Y_1 \supset \cdots,$$ where $Y_p$ is the union of all Schubert varieties $\Omega_{\lambda}$ with $|\lambda| \geq p$. Then I would have to take the cohomology of each member of the filtration, but how does one conclude that the Schubert classes form a basis of the cohomology ring in question? 

Suppose we have a Young diagram $\lambda$ inside an $r \times n$ rectangular grid, i.e. $\lambda \subset [r] \times [n]$. If I were to add just one more box to $\lambda$, obtaining a new partition (Young diagram) $\lambda'$, would $\lambda'$ still lie inside the $r \times n$ rectangular grid? I'm asking this question because I'm trying to show that the complement of Schubert cells $\Omega_\lambda ^o$ inside a Schubert variety $\Omega_\lambda$ is the union (not necessarily disjoint) of all Schubert varieties $\Omega_{\lambda'}$, where $\lambda'$ is obtained from $\lambda$ by adding one box. I think symbolically, what I'm trying to show is that $\Omega_{\lambda}- \Omega_{\lambda}^o= \bigcup_{\lambda' \supset \lambda} \Omega_{\lambda'}$. Anyhow, I will try to prove it myself, but would like some clarification as to whether my intuition is correct. 

Background Let $F$ be a $p$-adic local field, and let $G$ be a connected reductive group over $F$. Recall that there is a rich theory of compact open subgroups of $G(F)$ which is, essentially, encapsulated in the theory of Bruhat-Tits. There they associate to $G$ a combinatorial object called a building $B(G,F)$ upon which $G(F)$-actions, and for which many classes of 'nice' compact open subgroups of $G(F)$ can be understood as stabilizers of certain 'nice' combinatorial subobjects of $B(G,F)$. These are incredibly valuable since these 'nice' compact open subgroups of $G(F)$ are pivotal in understanding many aspects of the structure of $G(F)$ (e.g. in the construction of representations of $G(F)$ in the form of the Moy-Prasad filtration or as 'reasonable levels' in Shimura varieties). This combinatorial data can be somewhat daunting, and so it is sometimes (at least for me) more convenient to have a way of understanding these 'nice' compact open subgroups of $G(F)$ without needing to understand the inner workings of the Bruhat-Tits machine. As an example, one type of 'nice' compact open subgroup of $G(F)$ are the so-called hyperspecial subgroups. One can define these purely in terms of $B(G,F)$, but one can also define them as $\mathcal{G}(\mathcal{O}_F)$ where $\mathcal{G}$ is a reductive model of $G$ over $\mathcal{O}_F$. This allows one to work with hyperspecial subgroups without having to understand the whole definition of $G(\mathcal{O}_F)$. The question below is whether another class of 'nice' subgroups can be understand in a similar way. Actual question Let $F$ be a $p$-adic local field with ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_F$ and residue field $k$. Let $G$ be a connected unramified reductive group over $F$. To what extent is it true that parahoric subgroups of $G(F)$ are pullbacks of parabolic subgroups of $\mathcal{G}_k$ for $\mathcal{G}$ a reductive model of $G$ over $\mathcal{O}_F$? Namely, if $\mathcal{G}$ is a reductive model of $G$ over $\mathcal{O}_F$, and $P$ is a parabolic subgroup of $\mathcal{G}_k$, then is $\mathrm{red}^{-1}(P(k))\subseteq \mathcal{G}(\mathcal{O}_F)$ a parahoric subgroup of $G(F)$ (here $\mathrm{red}:\mathcal{G}(\mathcal{O})\to \mathcal{G}(k)$ is the reduction map) a parahoric subgroup of $G(F)$? Do they all arise in this manner? I know that one can define parahorics as the $\mathcal{O}_F$-points of 'parahoric group schemes', but the definition of these is very opaque to me. Do these generalize the above construction in some sense? If one can say more, feel free to assume that $G$ is split. 

I have proved that $\phi_{\sigma,g}$ and constant maps are endomorphism, so $ \cup\phi_{\sigma,g} \cup C_{I(B_n(G))} \subseteq End_0 (B_n(G))$ we have proved the converse part: Let $\theta \in End_0(B_n(G))-C_{I(B_n(G))}$, then define $\theta_i : [n] \times G \times [n] : \rightarrow [n]$, where i=1,2 such that $(i,a,j) \theta = ((i,a,j) \theta_1 , b , (i,a,j) \theta_2)$, for some $b \in G$, where $[n] = \{ 1,2, \cdots , n\}$ Some work I have done , we get for any $k \in [n]$ $$ (l,a,k) \theta_2 = (k,e,j) \theta_1$$ $$(l,a,k) \theta_1 = (l,a,j) \theta_1$$ $$(l,a,j) \theta_2 = (k,e,j) \theta_2$$ we conclude that $\theta_1$ depends only first cordinates and $\theta_2$ depends only third cordinate.So we define $\sigma$ on $[n]$ such that $$ i \sigma = (i,e,k)\theta_1 = (k,a,i)\theta_2$$ which is a bijective map. Then $(i,a,j) \theta = ((i,a,j) \theta_1 , b , (i,a,j) \theta_2) = (i \sigma , b , j \sigma)$. Similarly I want to define an endomorphism $f$ on $G$ such that $(i,a,j)\theta = (i\sigma , af , j\sigma)$ If we define $f : G \rightarrow G$ is such that $(i,a,j )\theta = (i \sigma , b , j \sigma)$, then $af = b$. Then $f$ is well defined if $(i,a,j )\theta = (i \sigma , b , j \sigma)$, where $b \in G$ is fixed and $\forall \ \ i,j \in [n]$. I am unable to show that $(i,a,j )\theta = (i \sigma , b , j \sigma)$, where $b \in G$ is fixed and $\forall \ \ i,j \in [n]$. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you 

I have tried: when $\lambda = 1$ the proof is trivial. Therefore we assume that $\lambda \geq 2.$ Let $T$ be a semigroup and $h : B_{\lambda}^o(S) \rightarrow T$ is a homomorphism . Without loss of generality we can assume that the homomorphism $h$ is surjective map. suppose $(0_s)h = 0_T$ and $k$ be in $T$, then $$ k (0_s)h = (x)h . (0_s)h = (x.0_s)h = (0_s)h$$ thus $0_T$ is zero of $T$. Also we know that the semigroup $B_{\lambda}^o(1_s)$ is a congruence free, where $1_s$ is the identity element of $S$. So any homomorphism $g : B_{\lambda}^o(1_s) \rightarrow T$ is either trivial or isomorphism. we fix $\alpha_o \in I_{\lambda}$, for every $\alpha , \beta \in I_{\lambda}$, we denote $1_{\alpha,\beta} = (\alpha, 1_s , \beta)h$ and $T^*_{\alpha,\beta} = \{ (\alpha, s , \beta)h : s \in S\backslash \{0\} \} \backslash \{0_T\}$ and $T_o= T^*_{\alpha_o , \alpha_o}$. Firstly we shall show that for any $\alpha, \beta , \gamma , \delta \in I_{\lambda}$, we have $|T^*_{\alpha,\beta}| = |T^*_{\gamma,\delta}|$, by defining the maps $$\phi_{(\alpha,\beta)}^{(\gamma, \delta)} : T^*_{\alpha,\beta} \rightarrow T^*_{\gamma,\delta}$$ by $$(x) \phi_{(\alpha,\beta)}^{(\gamma, \delta)} = 1_{\gamma ,\alpha}.x.1_{\beta,\delta}$$ similarly we can define the maping $$\phi_{(\gamma,\delta)}^{(\alpha, \beta)} : T^*_{\gamma,\delta} \rightarrow T^*_{\alpha,\beta}$$ Composition of both map is identity map, so both are mutually invertible maps and hence we have $|T^*_{\alpha,\beta}| = |T^*_{\gamma,\delta}| = |T_o|$. Next I want to show that $T = I_{\lambda} \times T_o \times I_{\lambda} \cup \{0_T\}$,but i am unable how to prove. I would be thankful if someone help me to show
