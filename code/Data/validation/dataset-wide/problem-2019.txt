My aim was always to go to Europe/US/Canada to work as developer after finishing my study. Last month my degree completed and I got 2 Gold Medals in Computer Science and I already had won few small medals in past. The current company I work for as freelancer, is a small one and they can't offer me to join their office. Even though they like my work a lot. They even said me that they are looking into possibilities of taking me to their office but I don't they will be able to do so, as there are expenses and a lot of paperwork. So, now I'm able to see a lot of vacancies in countries I want that match my skills and offer relocation. But problem is experience. I worked: 1 month in first company, 3 months in second, 4 months in third, and for about 6 months I have been working as freelance. One more strange thing, I was the best in all companies, they loved my work, and the way I quit, they just hate me now. So I can't expect any feedback from past companies. How will I explain to new company recruiters the high quit frequency I had in past? I can't tell them stories like I did here, do I? Should I skip this in my experience section of CV/resume? Is it me who is bad? Any advice will be appreciated. 

According to the Social Security Administration's Legal requirements to provide your Social Security number, the following situations require it: 

If it is not your primary position, and there is nothing to be gained by adding it, there's no reason to add it to your resume proper. You will still need to disclose it on any application you fill out that asks you about "n previous positions". However, if it is a position that fills a gap on your resume of some length (e.g. 2-3 months), then add it as whatever title you hold there -- if it is "On-call Developer" or "Developer", or whatever. You don't have to go into any detail about how much you worked or when; the goal of this entry is to show that you didn't have a gap, not that you did great things (unless you did, in which case by all means talk about them). If I'm reviewing your resume and I read that it's not a full-time job (or for that matter isn't a job you've held for very long), I'm not expecting to learn anything from it besides someone invested time in you and you didn't get fired. In other words, not much. 

Asking them to check in their code as I am waiting on a piece of functionality that I know they have completed. I just ask to be notified when this has happened so I don't have to constantly check. They tell me they are checking in their code right now but nothing happens for a while. When I quiz them after a period of time they say they are doing it just now and suddenly it's done. I ask if they could send me some information on their task as it's related to what I am doing and would help me in my work at the time. 

You ask if your expectations are reasonable, and without hesitation I say that unequivocally it is completely reasonable for someone to provide you with the basic information about position(s) applied for and preferred areas of emphasis, for precisely the reasons that you describe. Note: of course not all positions are the types for which letters of recommendation, rather than general references or employment verifications, are used. My answer is best used for those that are, which happen to be the types of positions I deal with the most. YMMV. 

I find I have quite a bad memory so when I ask a team member if they could do something and let me know when it's done I tend to forget about it and rely on that person to remember and hence let me know when it's done. However I find myself constantly having to chase people up when I realized they haven't done it. It's not just on the odd occasion but I find it happens the majority of the time to the point where I don't feel like I can trust the members in our team to remember to do something that we talked about. Not only that, I find it effects my time as I feel like I have to remember not only my tasks but others as well. I understand everyone is busy with their work and so don't expect people to jump when said jump p.s. I'm not a manager as we work in a agile environment and so try to facilitate a flat level hierarchy where we can! What I would like to do is become better at helping facilitate better communication between team members and expressing the desire that when we discuss an issue and agree to doing something the person takes ownership of that request. 

I'm really worried about the way things went with my career. I've started computer science study by switching from a different field. 

I was so much into programming that I got my first job after my first semester. I was offered 120$ per month only. The boss was a really hard person. The money was even hardly covering the fuel expenses to reach office. So, I quit after 1 month. Boss was angry. Second job I got after some months, and I was offered about 250$ per month. I worked for 3 months and I was suddenly offered 900$/month from another company. The 250$ was covering only 10 days of month and remaining 20 days, I had to live on loan. The boss was good person but other job offer was only for immediate joining, I told boss and he said me that he can raise my salary to 400$/month. Other job salary was more than double and even the position was a lot better with a bit large team, so I quit, and the boss was angry as he had planned many other things for me to work on already. I joined the third company. Things were good but the bosses on top were not even IT guys, so they kept saying to do more and I really worked to keep them happy. Still I was happy. There were a couple of complaints from this company. First, there was no arrangement of food. There was so dirty and even toxic street food available in day time (and we had to pay our self, I was cool with it but bad food and hard work really?). Company was in a really bad location that there was no Govt control over food quality. I still kept going with constant complaint about food. It was summer and temperature started to raise up-to 40-45 degree Celsius. My office was on top of building say hello to sun all the time. I kept working sweat in heat under only a fan. But it became too much with time as they kept promising that air-conditioner will be installed next Monday. So, 4 Mondays passed, and no Air Conditioner. Bosses stopped to attend office because of heat, we started to receive instructions in email from bosses, but me and few more guy (Those also quit before me) had to keep working because of deadlines. So, after 4 Mondays I quit. I was becoming so much physically sick, that I had to quit suddenly, even I didn't go to receive my last month salary as they had said to work for 1 week more before leaving and there was no way I was going to sit in that hell for a another single moment. One more thing, they had promised to pay double for extra hour/day. They never paid a single peny for extra hour, even though there were always extra days and hours. Now I work as freelance developer for a nice small company in Canada. I make good money. 

Generally I think referring or recommending someone for a position is a risky business. Essentially you are putting your reputation on the line in that how they perform may reflect on you. I would suggest never recommending or backing someone unless you were confident in their abilities and had a complete grasp of their work ethic. If you believe you have this then by all means put in a word in the right ear. I think in this day and age I would consider recommendations from existing employees (especially if I value their contributions) go a long way to selecting a condidate for a position. I think you have done well to say send in your CV, but perhaps make it clear that you are not reponsible for the actual hiring process etc Perhaps say the HR have some fairly strict processes everyone needs to follow but you could have a talk with the brother and give him some pointers. It might also give you a chance to sound him out! If he is a slacker and you have referred him then yes, I would imagine it will reflect badly on you in some context. FYI. I once recommended and got a good friend a position. I knew he was a hard worker and he ended up being an excellent worker. He in turn got another friend a job but that guy ended up being a bit of a slacker. He said to me that he regretted recommending him as he felt it reflected badly on him and other co-workers talked about him all the time how bad he was. It put him in an awkward situation both in the workplace and in the social scene with this friend. Although your situation is a brother of a friend it too might put your friendship in a potentially strained situation if things don't turn out. Just be prepared for that and try and maintain a work / friendship seperation if you can with your friend. 

I'm a big fan of regular 1:1 meetings (both having them with my direct reports and with my own manager) and from my perspective it's perfectly fine to ask your new manager if he or she would like to schedule 1:1 meetings with you (although he or she should really be on that already, but let's give them the benefit of the doubt that they're just settling in to their position). Your manager could always say no, which would certainly tell you something about your manager and his or her management style, but there's no harm in asking. Should the manager initiate it? Yes, I would expect that. But, if they don't, and you really want the opportunity to speak on a regular basis, you should say so. When you ask for a standing meeting, it's important to show that you have a reason for it, which gets to the second part of your question. Absent a "formal" structure for the 1:1, but with the goal of providing some sort of agenda so as not to waste anyone's time (yours or your manager's), you could follow the general organization of the daily stand-up meeting used by practitioners of Agile: what did you do yesterday, what are you working on today, what blockers do you have in front of you. Of course, such detail is not really appropriate for a weekly or bi-weekly 1:1 with your manager, but you certainly could provide an overview of what you did since the last time you talked, talk generally about what's in front of you, and then talk about any issues or concerns that you have. All of that would start what should be an organic conversation between you and your manager; if you do 1:1s regularly you'll probably find your own way into a conversational structure that works for both of you and provides good and useful information. On a related note, Rands talks about 1:1s from a manager's point of view, and how they're the chance for a manager to listen for updates, vents, (and possibly head off) disasters. All of that assumes a regular and useful semi-structured conversation in which you can both speak honestly, and again, from a manager's perspective (although not your manager), going to your manager and asking to implement something like that to foster a good working relationship is a good thing. 

I had this same situation and what I did was rather than look for payment perks, I attempted to get other benefits as part of my package. Some of these for me included: 

The ultimate person responsible in my opinion for morale building is the top honcho. YOU! However you can delegate this down the chain to ensure it is being addressed to those you think might fit the bill and have a more on the ground feel for how things are going in the team. However you set the standard (expectations) and those assigned specific tasks then try to implement and see them through. For other tasks it can depend on your relationship with your employees and their job allocations. Sometimes I've seen the person responsible for dealing with the bills, office tasks etc take on the role of employee welfare. For bonus setting it might be a senior manager/person who leads the gathering of this information and all the donkey work but gets any final sign-off by yourself Although these roles can be done by one person I would think your company size is big enough (but not so big for a full time HR) that it may be split between individuals concerned with you still having the ultimate say if and as required. 

Speaking as a hiring manager, it is not dishonest to include skills that you never want to use again. It just means you'll have an extra thing or two to talk about during an interview (that you have the skill, and that you don't particularly want to use it, so you're just making sure this job doesn't require it). As you note, all the skills you have work to make you the person you are, and have provided you with experiences you can learn from or leverage in some way. Also, if you list it, and it's remotely related to the position I'm interviewing for, I'll ask you about it. The responsibility is yours to apply to positions that you want, just as it is my responsibility to try to make your resume fit what I'm looking for. Let's say you had 5 years of experience making widgets lefthanded, and 3 years of experience making widgets righthanded, but you never ever want to make widgets lefthanded again, don't take it off your resume -- just don't apply to any lefthanded widgetmaking positions. If I need a widgetmaker of unspecified handedness, I'll see lefthanded and righthanded widgetmaking, and say "ok, this person can make widgets!" In the interview process, you can tell me you never want to make widgets lefthanded, and I can say "no problem, how about righthanded?" and you can say "sure!" and everyone is happy. Or, I can say "well, sometimes we might need a lefthanded widgetmaker" and you can say "you know, I never ever ever want to do that again" and then with my cards on the table (a possibility of having to dabble in a despised skill) you can make the decision that's best for you. If you didn't include your despised lefthanded widgetmaking experience, I'd think you were maybe some run of the mill widgetmaker, not the well-rounded widgetmaker that you are. But if the possibility of having to discuss the despised skill is too much to bear, and it doesn't add any benefit to you at all, leave it off. Note: Will there be recruiters who use those skills as keywords and seek you out based (possibly) on things you never want to do again? Absolutely. Just delete those emails. 

I like what Erik said in one of his comments starting with the "I'm confused...". One of the tricks I believe in dealing with bosses is making them feel like they make all the decisions, know everything and are the greatest bosses in the world (stroking their ego is what I like to think it is). One of the tricks I use to do this is sometimes make myself seem like I don't know what is happening when I notice something "I believe" is wrong (it may NOT be). This is leading on from Eriks comments. Sometimes I'll say things like: I'm struggling to grasp this code. Can you talk me through it. We have started implementing some processes that will help make our team more productive in the future. I'm not sure how this new code fits into that. Can you talk me through it. Is there any reasoning why you did this like this? We have some similiar setups that we are working on that might make this easier to implement in the future. Sometimes we just have to put up with the "interesting things" that bosses do. Some bosses find it hard to step away completely and really enjoy getting in there. However they don't like to believe they are no longer required and sometimes don't want to show their inadequacies in case they feel the team might lose respect in their abilities. Basically, try and make your boss feel like the changes he did was really helpful but you don't quite understand how they fit into the direction that the boss and your team is trying to follow. If your boss has insecurities etc you may have to just be prepared to have to review all his code and try and fix/change them without his knowledge after he has made it. In the end, you can make suggestions and talk to your boss, but you can't change his way of working. That is up to him and his bosses.
