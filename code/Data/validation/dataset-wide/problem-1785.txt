Install software from packages!!! Say No to source code compilation. It's 2010 now, you know? If there is no package for your software then you should build it yourself. Error message clearly says that you should run You also can try running if above doesn't work out. 

Question is fully answered about a three time by now, so I wanted just add some cents. Note that for quite a some time default ipfw config drops this kind packets: 

I think the best solution is to drop all IPv6 traffic via firewall. There is manual how to use ip6tables in Linux: ip6tables: IPv6 Firewall For Linux 

Also upgrading BIOS should probably help. PS. Why not ? It's faster and if you have both and in it's definitely the best choice. 

and much more. You can access SEL (if it's available on your hardware) via or commands, see: ipmiutil sel - show firmware System Event Log records 

I guess that "server's control panel" software can be rewritten to be more efficient and not to degrade performance over time. NB! Do not copy/paste s from production servers - there could be some sensitive information inside that JSON e.g. logins/passwords/session/API-keys/etc. 

Also descriptor count can be tuned via in some NICs Regarding your question "idrops vs. drops" you should look sources for 

"If you leave this set to a world-readable directory, other users on the server may be able to hijack sessions by getting the list of files in that directory. " 

I think for load-balancing you should use specialized tools like HAProxy / nginx that have small footprint and very good performance. 

Since August 2009 flash 10 works with out problems on FreeBSD. You can use either linux-f10-flashplugin10 with f10 linuxulator or linux-f8-flashplugin10 with f8. After port instalation there is some black magic with nspluginwrapper and symlinks 

First we had try to reboot modem because it usually did a magic but it didn't help now. So we also restarted hylafax and even whole server. After hylafax was started again it hangs here 

I have the following issue with my modem Sportster Flash X2. We had set it up with hylafax and it worked week or two. But today during receiving of fax it hangs and is not responding. Here is log from the last time modem was working 

Access for internet sites is working fine. As well as access for our other internal webservers. For these squid is also returning TCP_MISS/304 in logs but whole content with resources is displayed correctly. I don't need cache, squid is used mainly for restriction of users for internet. Here is my squid config: 

I am not a squid expert and I would like to ask you for your opinion. I have gateway running debian 7.1 wheezy with Squid 2.7.STABLE9-4.1 installed. Then I have a server running Windows 2000 (this one resides in local network). On this server our accounting website is running. Finally I have Ubuntu (13.10) workstation with system wide proxy set up for the squid. Workstation use squid for access to internet as well as for localnet. When I try to connect to main page on windows server I can see TCP_MISS/200 on squid for the page. This one is retrieved but all resources it contains (css,js,images) are retrieved with TCP_MISS/304. I inspect whole page request/response process in web inspector (on one of the workstations) and all resources of main page (which are hitting TCP_MISS/304 in squid) show me this error page: 

IIRC PC can have any number of MSI interrupts. But each device is limited to 32 (for PCI 2.2) or 2048 (for PCI 3.0) MSI interrupts. See also wiki about Message Signaled Interrupts 

Frame arrives at NIC's rx descriptor ring. Through DMA it gets transferred to RX ring in RAM. Driver converts device specific descriptors in RX ring to some kind of general network kernel structure (e.g. / or ). Also here packet gets copied to bpf device. In depending on protocol and address families of the frame it gets processed by corresponding (protocol switch) array entry. Then after or / datagram arrives at socket layer to the corresponding routing daemon's (socket receive buffer). From this point routing daemon usually gets notified about pending data on socket via some kind of I/O notification facility (select(2) / poll(2) / epoll(7) / kqueue(2)) and uses recv(3) on that socket to extract packets' payload. Here / / takes it's place. Routing daemon does it's magic and alters kernels' routing table(s) via routing sockets (PF_ROUTE in BSD derivatives or PF_NETLINK's NETLINK_ROUTE in Linux) 

I suppose applying that patch to your kernel should fix the problem. Also you may try to increase default rcv buffer size in both OS and application ( ) And your second question about - Linux increments that stat inside [3]. That function is usually called when socket goes over it's rcv limits. So yet again you can either increase your / and/or tune your application to make read() calls more frequently (I assume your drops are closely correlated with Java's Stop-The-World GC pauses. So, tune your GC). [0] $URL$ [1] $URL$ [2] $URL$ [3] $URL$ 

We also tried to replace Sportster with ZyXEL U1496 (which was also working before this issue) and this one is also not responding. After connecting to modem with cu or minicom it appears connected but not response after AT+FCLASS? command or else. Could it be something in hylafax or am I missing something. I have browsed a lot of forums and after reboot of modem everything should work but in our case it is not like that. Update Ok now we are 100% sure modem is all right. We have tried to plug modem into win XP machine and also to different linux machine. On both modem is working without problem and I can query it with basi AT commands. It seems problem is with serial on first server but there is nothing in logs which could indicate problem. By the server is new HP 360e Gen8 ProLiant so I hope port has not died. I can connect to modem with cu -l /dev/ttyS0 but no AT commands are not working. I have also tried /etc/init.d/setserial restart but it does not help. System is Debian Wheezy 7.6 kernel 3.2.0-4-amd64 Thx very much for your help. 

My /var/log/squid/store.log is signalling that object is not even saved on disk and used only from memory. So I persume there is no caching in this case which is fine. My question is: Why for one server isn't response loaded correctly(with error message - see above) and for second one is? Am I missing something in configuration. If I understand it right TCP_MISS/304 means that server's resource has not been modified and squid is not holding it in its own cache. So the browser must use its own cache. If it contains nothing browser submit If-Modified-Since request which will forward to the server.If the object hasn't been modified, it'll get a 304, which Squid will pass on to your browser. Most interesting is that resources from 2nd server are loaded properly without any errors and with TCP_MISS/304 as well. On the other side windows server pop ups cache shutting down error and only main page is loaded correctly and its resources not (also with TCP_MISS/304). Permission for cache folders and files are correct. Here is cache.log for particular request for css file of accounting app which should be loaded but it is not. I added only last part from it because it is quite long (I've used debug_options ALL,5 - quite verbse). 

May be driver/firmware for you controller is not in initramfs for 10.04. If that is the case - only way for you to get LTS release is to use backported kernel. Try installing ubuntu 10.04.3 via from newer images (e.g., Oneiric) or hack original DVD and place newer kernel/initramfs there. Also as workaround you can install system on disks plugged in onboard SATA controller. 

You can probably workaround that problem by changing your docker's network settings (e.g. disable IPv6). Or if you have some time to spare you can try resolving to a LOC and try figuring out what could've caused GPF there. PS. Also you you probably haven't posted your first Oops here, since you already have and in your 

The problem is you don't have any files to build. Start with obtaining the kernel source codes. Then use link petre provided or use this one 

Do you need varnish at all? 1. nginx can cache results on disk or in memcached 2. nginx has SSI 3. nginx has fair load balancer or ey-balancer 4. Best practice says that HAProxy before nginx is good move. Don't forget about KISS - more components your system has - less stable it becomes. 

What you think is good notebook for sysadmin? May be you can list specific models; What hardware extensions(i.e. USB devices) you think should be added to "sysadmin must-have" list; 

Do you have direcive in site-enabed configs? PS. You can also listen on another IP/PORt for server status. 

And even lower level hardware tunings accessible via . PS. Read kernel the docs, especially Documentation/networking/scaling.txt PPS. While tuning TCP performance you may want to consult with RFC6349 PPPS. D-Link is not the best network hardware. Try Intel hardware with pci-x or pci-64
