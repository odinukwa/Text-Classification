The tidal locking timescale depends on several factors: $$\tau_{lock} \approx \frac{0.4 \omega_0 a^5 m Q}{3 G M^2 k_2 r^3}$$ such as the initial spin rate $\omega_0$, the semimajor axis $a$, the mass $m$, the solar mass $M$, the radius $r$ and various dissipation parameters $Q$ and $k_2$. Two planets that merely differ in $a$ will have the inner one lock much earlier than the outer one. But give them slightly different $\omega_0$, $m$ and especially $r$ and the inner might dissipate more slowly than the outer. There is also the possibility of spin-orbit resonances. Mercury is in 3:2 resonance, and tidal forces might lock planets into 2:1 or 5:2 resonances. That way the inner planet may be in a resonant lock while the outer is tidally locked 1:1. In fact, Venus is turning very slowly (and retrogradely) so it is not too far off, although the causes of the retrograde spin are unclear. So, yes, you can have tidally locked planet orbiting outside non-locked planets. 

No, they are being discovered where they are in their (usually fairly stable) orbits. They are not discovered because they are arriving or going to some particular location. The one exception is long-periodic comets that have fallen in from the Oort cloud and now pass through the inner parts of the solar system, maybe to be captured by the gravity of Jupiter in a closer orbit. (Strictly speaking all these objects are all pulled towards a central location, the Sun, but because they already have a sideways velocity that just means an orbiting motion where they are constantly falling around it.) NEOs are too light and small to interact much with each other - the gravitational influence between them is microscopic compared to the influence from the planets which is usually microscopic compared to the sun's influence. The reason we are seeing a lot more NEOs now is that new instruments are better and more searches are being conducted. LINEAR for example found 231,082 small Solar System bodies (of which 2,423 are NEOs) in the early 2000s and the Catalina Sky Survey has found 6,515 NEOs since 2009. 

Suppose you have a star with luminosity varying between $L_{min}$ and $L_{max}$. Then the inner limit of the life zone will be in the interval $[c_1\sqrt{L_{min}},c_1\sqrt{L_{max}}]$ where $c_1\approx 0.7$ AU (or whatever value you think makes sense for the inner limit). The outer limit will be in $[c_2\sqrt{L_{min}},c_2\sqrt{L_{max}}]$ with $c_2\approx 1.4$ AU. So if $c_1\sqrt{L_{max}}<c_2\sqrt{L_{min}}$ there will be a region that is always in the life zone. 61 Cygni A has magnitude varying between 5.19 and 5.27, $L_{min}=0.666807$ and $L_{max}=0.717794$. That gives a constantly habitable zone between 0.61 and 1.14 AU. Narrower than the Sun's, but still there. A randomly changing luminosity might make climate somewhat unstable, but if it changes fast enough it might not couple very strongly. Now, the flares and other effects of being a variable star with big starspots may prove bad for volatile retention and life, but it is not clear how big that problem is. 

Yes. There are no edges of the universe that have been observed. The standard cosmological models favoured by observations (open or flat universes) allow you to move outwards indefinitely. Closed universes are like the surface of a sphere, and you would eventually return to Earth unless the expansion was too fast; the same is true for the models with nontrivial topologies - but these have no evidence at present. 

This kind of location is called a peak of eternal light. Apparently there is no certain identification of such a peak on the Moon, but there are definitely places that get more than 86% sunlight during the lunar year (ignoring eclipses). Kaguya did not find any permanent peaks, but there is apeak near Peary at the North Pole that gets 89%, and several places near the South Pole that have multi-month illumination. Calculating the requirements for such a peak is complicated since the moon is definitely not spherical on the hundreds of meter scale; at the very least one needs an ellipsoid model. The south pole situation is complicated because there is a large basin around the actual pole. 

Yes. We can see "stellar streams" surround the Milky Way, long streams of stars from globular clusters and dwarf galaxies that have been disrupted by the galaxy and are now slowly merging with it. There is an upper limit (based on the amount of blue stars in the halo) of about 60 past such mergers. It does not look like the Milky Way formed from a big merger. Had it done so it would have a much thicker and fuzzier disk (lots of "heating" by having stars in random orbits). The Andromeda collision will turn the galaxies into an elliptical galaxy, which has even less structure. 

The fundamental problem is the heat capacity of the planet. If you keep it out of sunlight long enough it will eventually cool to the temperature of the background ratiation, bit it will take a long time. If we just treat it as a blackbody surrounded by a 0 K universe the cooling time will roughly be $t_{cool}\approx 2.5\cdot 10^{11}$ seconds if we want to reach 300 K. That is about 7900 years. Wait for about 29,000 years and you can start scooping up frozen carbon dioxide. And this assumes good heat conduction and that the interior is not hotter - I think there will be bad geological issues when trying to change the crust temperature. Another issue is of course the total lack of sunlight. Martyn Fogg describes a neat solution in his book Terraforming: orbit a reflector in a polar orbit, angled at 45 degrees so it reflects sunlight to the planet. This would for the right orbit give a daily cycle despite Venus rotation issues and the shade shield. Whether this is a sensible start for terraforming or just evidence that the technology does not help very much depends on your level of optimism and timescales. For exploration you may want a method that does not transform your exploration target as much. 

It all depends on shared knowledge. What you are getting at is known in philosophy as indeterminacy of translation. But note that the alien is already talking to the human: there has to be a language present, and languages do contain a lot of assumptions about the world (tenses imply that there is time, and the question itself implies space, for example). Now, consider a sequence of larger and larger scale maps of the neighbourhood, running from one showing the solar system to one showing the cosmic web. That seems to settle the "where" question using pattern matching fairly well... ...except that there is the obvious question of what the maps show. In this particular example it is stellar baryonic matter, about 0.002 of the total mass/energy budget. If the alien is made of dark matter this will not make much sense except that it would on the larger scales recognise the topology of the web of halo structures it was familiar with. If it knew about baryonic matter it would infer that this was a map of baryonic stuff. Similarly a gaseous alien might think we have left out the 90% of baryonic matter that is intergalactic plasma. But the point is, the right kind of map or explanation would latch onto something in the knowledge of the alien and allow them to start inferring more meaning. Since this is not just sending a single message but a conversation there is a lot of room for testing and exploration: "So you are telling me where you are using a map showing 'pulsars'. Are they [untranslatable1] or [untranslatable2]?" "What is the difference between [untranslatable1] and [untranslatable2]?" "[untranslatable1] is spatially localised but extends across time, [untranslatable2] is temporally localised but spread out in space." "Then [untranslatable1] sounds more reasonable. We know them as compact stars that rotate fast and send radio waves." "Are 'stars' also spatially localised and extend across time?" ... It won't be easy, and it is quite possible that our map doesn't correspond to a known region (if the aliens are communicating in some weird non-local way; had they communicated in a local way they would have known the answer to the questions already). But pattern matching and interactive bootstrapping from the shared language and knowledge-base would be a way of getting around the indeterminacy of translation.
