So can we expand our knowledge about "Four great elements" in Buddhism using the knowledge that we have already understood by other means? 

So far it is very dreadful. What should be the response to this kind of a law in any country? How to deal with government involvement in religion? 

I have not yet read the sutta you are referring to but i'm aware of both teaching (biological & Buddhist evolutions). So i am going to answer the last part of your question. 

I run a Buddhist blog with daily updates and i am facing a bit of trouble finding sources for it as i try to update it everyday with at least a single new article or a book everyday. I am already using "Accesstoinsight.org" as a primary source of good materials. Can you please mention a few more such good web sites? 

We all know the famous nine values of Lord Buddha that we often recite when worshiping Lord Buddha. But i've heard the extended versions of those 9 values. Can someone point me a source to learn them? 

I saw something like this done by Lord Buddha when Lord Buddha tamed the anger of "Anguli maala". Lord Buddha says.... "I've stopped now you should" while walking, this was said in reference to the stopped journey through samsara in a Lord Buddha's life not in reference with feet. 

Here is the answer given by Lord Buddha to a similar matter... There were many religious groups and cults in India at Lord Buddha's time and almost each had their own signature practices, Some were naked,Some were living like animals (Cows,Dogs) and many more.All of them had one purpose, Finding the end. There was a group who said to their followers "You must boil the water you drink because if you drink it any other way those very small beings in water would die" (An amazing early reference to Micro organisms). When people asked for Lord Buddha's take on this Lord Buddha's reply was.... Yes there are beings in water and yes there is a chance they might die, but if you boil the water you are obviously going to kill them as an effect of boiling. But what can you do? you must drink water.As you have no intention to kill those beings you are not responsible for the deaths that might occur from consuming water. 

About the Statue called Laughing Buddha... The Statue called Laughing Buddha is not Lord Buddha or any Buddha. He is some local divine figure in some culture in the east and this statue is misunderstood as a Buddha because it has a name that sounds a lot like Buddha. It's correct pronunciation should be like this or something close - Laughing Budhai 

So where does the compassion comes to play? Say you are hungry and you can hunt. If you go hunting it is bad Karma. If you let an animal die so you can eat later it is bad Karma. 

(The person who asked the question asked......) Is it correct to think i'm walking now, now i'm taking the right foot, now i'm taking the left foot. as a form of mindfulness? (My teachers answer....) What is the reason that we as Buddhists go on to practice mindfulness? Because we are trying to reach Nirvana. And when we are not mindful the mind start to wonder. Where does the mind wander? 

But then we end up with a question what exactly make "Gender" apart from a biological standpoint? or in a much simple term, Other than the body what makes a man and what makes a woman; Spiritually? 

Can someone provide a canonical explanation to Sanskara/Sankara? I appreciate if you can provide some sources,Suttras/Suttas so that i can expand my knowledge. 

We all have done bad karma,so if something is bugging my mind constantly (Like killing some mosquito) what is the solution for me,what can i do to overcome it/or to forget it? 

Here is the thing about Buddhist meditation.... For some meditational methiods there are some guidelines and for some it is how you like it. 

What is the real human realm, Is it Earth or are there many other places / Planets with humans? What are the words of Lord Buddha on this topic? I am looking for the Theravada perspective. 

Do not have many concerns. Try to relax and not to worry about the minor details. If you have pains while meditating do some vipassana meditation and focus on the impermanence of that pain and keep going on. It is essential that you give up the love for your own body and to do that you need to learn and realize just like all other things your body is temporary too. 

Lord Buddha asked us to focus on the path and not on fancy powers. Because you do not necessarily need to be a Buddhist to do all of that. Because even Before Lord Buddha's birth people was able to do so much more (Like inter-realm travel). 

No, It does not generate bad karma to accept death instead of conversion, actually every Buddhist should look forward to that. Our "Martyrs" do not take live they just lay their innocent lives with Mettha (Kindness) towards the killers themselves. If you are wondering why it does not become a bad Karma. Because it does not include Hate. We die with kindness towards these foolish ones who force faith on to others. 

I had the same issue and this is the advice i got from a monk... What we call meditating is not something that must be done while sitting down,you can meditate in many other positions. For example other than Breathing meditation you can actually do any other Buddhist meditation without having to sit down. Here are some examples.If you do not know these meditation click on it and it will open a web page for you to learn.All these meditations can be done without staying still so you will have all the time you need to meditate. Impermanent Meditation 1 - lesson Impermanent Meditation 2 - lesson Loving Kindness Meditation - lesson 

just BE WHO YOU ARE,Have you ever noticed that even when you were a party animal before people had stuff to complain?You are right to be mindful and you should do it every second you are awake,this might look a bit extreme but trust me it always help.as for having fun don't be immoral live your life but remember you are not a puppet of anybody friends respect who their friends really are,if they do not you might want to rethink about your entourage.If they ever ask about your sudden change don't mention meditation or your path simply say that people change with time and you are going through such a pace too.This should get you out of any awkward situation with your friends or family! 

But never discuss your meditation with your friends, Because it will awake each others ego and that would do more harm than good. But if you have any issues with your practice seek the help of a good master. I would advice you to seek a kind monk because ordinary people can be a bit ego driven. 

Historical updating of the rule.... Long after the Parinibbana of Lord Buddha kings took things a bit seriously. They saw that in case of a national emergency monks are at risk. Because if people have no food they can't give to monks. So kings came up with a good solution. They granted temples and monasteries with land & people to work. So the villagers would build houses and farm and in return share the harvest with the temple. As kings have already given the rights to the land and all upon it the rule does not break. Modern day updating of the rule.... Now as the society is getting busier there is a good chance that a family might miss their turn to offer food to the temple. So there is a trend to innovate. No matter if they are giving their offering or not people now bring some supplies with them to the temple as offerings, things like Rice,vegetables,Soya,Dried fish and etc. As the offering have been made it is OK to consume then when the need arise. 

There are two main pints two your question, And Lord Buddha directly answered both of those and here is the extended answer..... 

So the solution is..... If you need to be Mindful at all times the best option is to go with Vipassana. And there is no better way to be Mindful as "Vipassana" is a "Win Win" situation to the practitioner. Let me tell you why, If you start doing Vipassana and practice it well it will automatically fix your focus and you will feel yourself getting better at almost anything you do, And if you are to die you will dies with proper Mindfulness. And as lord Buddha once said 

If the "God" you are referring to is "The almighty" in Christianity or something similar Lord Buddha dumped the belief that life itself was made by a single being in a form of a creation. Lord Buddha clearly accepted his own form of evolution which start from basic life (Very similar to what you learn about evolution of early earth's basic life).Lord Buddha clearly said that universe is a creation of very natural events and it is not a creation of a being,Lord Buddha didn't stop there he went on to explain how he tried to learn about the beginning.It's what we call today the "coming to existence".Lord Buddha said that universe itself is immensely old and trying to find a beginning would be a fruitless effort. Once some one asked the very question you are asking "Is lord Buddha a god?". Lord Buddha replied saying "Because of my understanding i am above everyone else and i am only equal to another Lord Buddha,No i am not a god i am above them" The gods mentioned in Buddhism are not like gods in other religions.Here is a small list of details. 

This may be a situation in which a child's views or hopes are neglected, But if it wasn't for the temple who knows what will happen to these children? In my own country we had some terrible incidents, some single parents killing their own children and killing themselves. These events occurred in a short period of time and all these incidents happened because of either Family or Financial trouble. The Temples provide a roof over these children and give them education. Temples do not hold these children against their will and do not force monkhood. If the children wish to stay without being a monk that is allowed too. 

As you have mentioned your personal experience let me share the confusion i once had that left me in the same question you are asking.This is my journey and what i found as the answer. Hope this helps... 

Is there any mentioning on how beings in different realms understand a single language, I mean even we don't use "Pali" now so how does it happen? 

I have learned..... When a receptor (eyes,ears,nose,tongue,body,mind) meet with the preferred input (light,sound,smell,taste,touch,thoughts) if the dedicated "Vinyana" is born to accept it the being will feel that particular sensation. So my question is.... Eyes can't see when they are closed Ears can't hear when we sleep Nose can't sense when we sleep Tongue can't sense when we sleep Body can't feel when we sleep But the mind does not seem to share the same condition with the rest of receptors.Because when we sleep some part of it function and when we are awake it is fully functioning. So does mind ever stop? Does mind start with the birth and keeps going till the last minute? What does the Suttas say? 

Learn more about "Abhidhamma" before you practice that discomforting method to understand what life is. 

You have asked about the Theravada view so i am going to answer that part. Mahayana has had the influence of eastern asian countries and therefore talk about things like Curses,Fortune etc. The issue here is that Theravada Buddhism does not believe in such things. Theravada view depends more on actions and their effect and does not give such significance to great ones like "Bodhisattvas" because it focus its respect on the triple gems.Great ones like "Bodhisattvas" are only mentioned and not much is being talked about them in daily Buddhist life. 

One day here on this SE i had an comment to one of my answers suggesting that it is rather discomforting or hard to accept that Buddhists have chosen death as their choice in difficult situations like Genocides,War,Racial conflicts and etc against killing for survival. But there are some war stories too. As i did not had a chance to learn all sides of this interesting question i thought to ask a question and openly invite the community to share their version of teaching on this matter. Feel free to add your ow personal experience too. 

This looks like a bunch of riddles, for that pardon me.... If someone run past you and some chasing him with weapons ask you if you saw him or not, seeing the danger that he is in you might want to lie but if you do not lie he might get hurt If your boss call you and ask if one of your Co-workers said something bad about the boss, you will have to be truthful but in doing so you break a precept as you are using your word to make two people dislike each other. In these kind of situations can we imagine some other thing and answer thinking i'm answering in reference to my imagination and skip the breaking of precepts? Like saying i did not saw the man who ran away, thinking "There is no such being called me in reality, also there is no man who ran away in reality either"?
