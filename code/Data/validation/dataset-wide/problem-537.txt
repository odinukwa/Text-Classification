There are many factors associated with bike fitting, not just the reach to the bars from the saddle. It seems that for optimal fit your bike frame is probably too big, you will have to compromise on ideal setup. But set up is always a compromise, as no two bodies are the same (and you don't have a custom bike). I am assuming this is a road bike and not a mountain bike. Physics controls the the way the front end feels - it is dependent on the size of the wheel and the length of the lever controlling deflection (this is very generalized). Bigger wheels are harder to deflect. Longer levers make it easier to deflect, as you have more...leverage :). There are way too many factors to go into, but the position of your hands on the bars, the stem length, the width and shape of the bar, and the position of the controls all come together to create that lever that steers your front wheel. A shorter stem makes it twitchy, 90mm is pretty neutral, and the professional sprinters, like in the Tour de France, often have 140mm stems, for stability in the tight finishes. On mountain bikes, a narrow flat bar is more twitchy than a massive 760mm wide downhill riser bar - the lever is longer from the center control point. As for seat setback...that can impact your power, it's not just about how far you are away from the bars. You can test it out by pedaling hard on a small rise - push yourself back on the saddle for one test, ride in the middle (where you normally would sit on the saddle) and then make a third attempt riding more forward, on the nose. You should be able to feel when your power is engaged with the pedals - that would be the ideal point for your saddle - and when it isn't, and it feels like a slog. This is also physics and the lever in this case is the femur. Bike fitters often use the marker of a vertical plumb line that drops from the knee to the pedal axle when the pedals are in line parallel to the ground. This, of course, varies - positional power also depends on your muscle power (if you have stronger quads vs stronger gluteals). As for fitting your bike - you will probably need to balance stem length with saddle setback and find something in the middle - pull the seat forward a bit and use a 75mm stem with a decent rise. You need to balance your reach to the bars with your position over the bottom bracket. Also remember saddle height - the saddle comes up at an angle when you raise or lower it (the angle of the seat post) so your distance to the pedals and the bars changes as you raise and lower the seat. If you move your saddle forward and back, you will need to raise or lower the saddle accordingly, until you get a good fit. Good fit means your hips are stable and level and don't rock - one way to adjust this it that when your pedal is at it's lowest point, with your heel on the pedal, your leg should be fully extended - not bent, not hyper extended and your hips shouldn't rotate so your heel can reach). Experimentation is the key. A good bike fitter can get you to an ideal, but it may not be what works for you, everyone is different and we all have different riding positions depending on what we want to accomplish - like beating your buddy to that next sign post or riding 200 miles in a day. If you aren't comfortable, you won't ride....and that is no fun. Good luck! 

I bike with two children, now aged 1 and 4, and have tried a number of solutions. A couple specific suggestions for you: First, some child seats come bundled with their own rack. One of them is the Topeak BabySeat. Second, heavy duty racks include weight ratings. Old Man Mountain is a respected brand and has a rack in their line rated to carry 70 lbs. Their racks are here. (Beware, it's not cheap!). My personal experience has been with carrying my kids on a bakfiets, Xtracycle and an electric Yuba Mundo. If you are interested, I have a lot more information and photos about those options on bikes-as-transportation.com. Good luck! 

Let me tell you from experience what doesn't work: Putting a cell phone in a the pocket of a "waterproof" jacket. I lost a phone that way, and another one saw the light at the end of a foggy, damp tunnel before returning back to life. If you are able to, turn gadgets you are carrying off. Having electricity flow through the system just increases the possibility of problems. For extra paranoia, remove the batteries. My rule of thumb is that any important electric should be "double waterproofed". Usually this is accomplished with a plastic bag (not necessarily anything special), inside a supposedly-waterproof pannier. A small "dry bag" would be durable, waterproof choice for small electronics. For touring, I looked for and found extra thick and tough garbage bags to use as an inner liner for my panniers. These are far less likely to be punctured than garden-variety plastic bags. Again, nothing special-- just a grocery store product. In a pinch, use two plastic grocery bags, applied around the electrics in opposite directions. If the gear does manage to get wet despite your best efforts, let it dry out thoroughly before turning it back on. 

If you are not sure what you need, take it to the bike shop. Front derailleurs are complicated! You need the derailleur that fits your bike design and the gears that are installed on that bike. There are five things to look at: attaching it to the bike, how many chainrings it needs to handle, the space it has to maneuver, whether the front shifter is indexed (sometimes it was only the rear) and how the FD is connected to the shifter. The attachment for MTBs is just 2 ways, an E-type (which is the fairly rare bottom bracket mount) or a band clamp around the seat tube. You need the right band size (the clamp) for your seat tube - old steel frame MTBs usually had 28.6, or if it's aluminum, it's usually a 34.9. This number is the diameter of the seat tube, in millimeters - you need to measure. Most of the older MTBs were built with triple chainrings, so most MTB front derailleurs will support that (you don't want a narrow cage double or one destined for the road, though it would probably fit the space). If the shifter is not indexed you will have a much easier time, if it is indexed, then you will need to be more particular in picking a FD - one that matches your front shifter. Now it gets complicated...there are top swing and bottom swing FDs. You need to be able to clamp the derailleur to the seat tube at the right height above the chainrings, but it can't be so low that it hits the chainstay when it swings to move the chain. This is the complicated part. Depending on the frame, and the size of your chainrings, either could fit. Older MTBs usually had bottom swing FDs. But there were interfering bottle bosses and weird high chainstays...who knows. You have already said that the cable goes under the BB shell, so you will need a bottom pull FD. If it went under the top tube, then you would need a top pull FD. Shimano make a dual pull, so it could do both (very handy for cyclocross bikes!), but if you had one, you still need to choose how it swings. Given the info you have provided, I would expect you to look for a Shimano 28.6, bottom swing, bottom pull...something like the FD-M650, which is a 90s era Deore DX. But I could easily be wrong :) Good luck! 

I had a bad case of sciatica due to a lower back issue, and riding my recumbent bike seemed to help a lot. I documented the experience in more detail on my blog. 

I regularly ride a 1971 Raleigh Twenty with a Sturmey Archer 3-speed hub. I do not maintenance the hub, and it continues to work fine, 40 years later. (Although I presume there were some years before I bought it a few years ago in which it wasn't ridden). I have also regularly ridden a Shimano Nexus 8 hub for the past 4 years, year-round in snow and rain in Indiana. I don't recall doing any maintenance on it yet, either. UPDATE: After about 5 years of regular use without maintenance the Shimano Nexus 8 hub eventually failed. Had I oiled and maintenanced it a bit, I presume it would have lasted longer. 

I have another number of other winter cycling articles on my blog if you'd like to read more about my experiences and gear. 

keeping your face warm while winter bike commuting I recommend ski googles and Seirus "Masque" over a balaclava. This mask only covers the bottom half of your face, and can be paired with merino wool hat worn underneath a helmet. This is more versatile, as you can remove the mask, but still wear the hat off-bike. I also use a scarf underneath my jacket to make sure there's a good seal to keep the wind out. For my kids, I still use a balaclava for simplicity on very cold days. 

I am assuming that you are talking about the handlebar. It is not an easy swap - you would need a new flat/riser bar, new shifters (to match the existing gears), new brake levers (to match the existing brakes), more than likely new cables and housing, plus some grips. Depending on the level of quality of the shifters...it could get very expensive. It could be more cost effective to sell that bike and buy a flat bar commuter. If it is a comfort issue, there are things that you can do to make the bike fit you better...you don't say why it is irritating. Good luck. 

The key to swapping forks is the axle to crown measurement - the distance from the center of the front axle to the seat of the crown race that is the lowest part of the headset. You want the replacement to be as close to the original as possible, to preserve the designed geometry. There are forks that can take either a 27.5 or a 29er wheel. The suspension fork is heavy, if your goal is light weight then you should consider the correct length carbon rigid fork. You will need to balance weight, cost...and what is available. Remember that you need to find a fork with the same steerer diameter - you can't put a tapered fork on a bike built to accept a standard 1 1/8" steerer. The difference between a 27.5 and a 29 can be large or small, depending on the tire size you choose - if you put a 27.5 wheel on the front with a 27.5 plus tire (3 inches wide) then the out diameter is nearly the same as a regular 29er tire, with a rigid fork you would have some suspension, too, without the weight. Good luck! 

I'll take a guess that you didn't keep the bike upright during the flat change, which led to the chain coming off inside the chain case. I had the same thing happen to me on a bakfiets, which also has a fully enclosed chain and an internal rear hub, I have detailed instructions how I recommend removing the wheel of a bakfiets, but I think the "trick" you may be looking for may simply be to keep the bike upright. 

This is the perfect time to re-evaluate wearing unpadded tights. You might not need the padding on your recumbent cycle, but it adds just an ounce or two to your shorts and blocks the wind just where you need it. Consider the Ibex merino wool Trio shorts. The merino wool has a broad comfort range from summer to winner. They are also comfortable to wear without squeezing. Keeping the entire region warmer with wool ought to help some as well! To get a deal on the shorts, subscribe to the Ibex mailing list and be patient. Over time, it seems nearly everything in their catalog will be available at a good discount at some point-- that's how I got mine! Also consider altering your diet to improve more warming, circulation-improving foods and spices like cayenne, cinnamon and ginger. That was the best thing I did to improve my warm for winter cycling. I write more about that at Cayenne for Winter Warmth. 

Rob, you are correct that a heavier bike will give you a greater fitness benefit over the same distance. The only real counter-point I have is that the most effective bikes for fitness are the ones that get ridden. So, if some reason a lighter bike would more fun or appealing to you (while still be a "good enough" commuter), than a lighter bike could be a better choice for you. In my experience, extra weight is not noticed much for commuting, so I'd rather have the durability of CroMoly over aluminum or carbon, and the practical benefits of fenders, racks, lights and bags. An anecdote: My wife rides a bike with electric assist. You might think electric assist would reduce the fitness benefit, but opposite is true for her. She takes more trips because she has electric assist (including carrying one or two children plus cargo), and thus ends up riding-- and pedaling-- more than if she had an unassisted bike. Some will suggest that you should get a lighter bike for "social" riding. That depends on who you ride with and what their fitness levels and interests are. I'm personally a stronger rider, and prefer to ride with my wife, parents and older friends, as well my children. For me, having a bike that's a bit heavier improves the social parity and helps to me ride naturally closer to the same speed with the people I prefer to ride with. If you want a hang with "Group A" club rides, lighter would be way the go instead. Whatever gets you out riding the most is best bike for you.
