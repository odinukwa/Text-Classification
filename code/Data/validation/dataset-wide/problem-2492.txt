Its very simple. If you're bored/frustrated with life as it is, you look to external stimulants to give you a lift because you don't wish to face life, as it is and as you are. Smoking/Drinking are stimulants/intoxicants and alter your state of mind. Your breathing changes. Your experience becomes more and more subject to external stimulation. Please see that it is not about wrong or right. I can't stress this point enough. The moment you think about wrong or right, you're starting to put unwanted curbs on freedom. It is natural to want to do/try something because everyone else seems to do it. But on the other hand, it is about your experience of life. Reflect on the following question. Do you want an unsullied/pure experience of life's moments? Or do you just want to zip through it? 

Hmm. I think "selfless action" will let you be peaceful, hard as it sounds. There is no need to sit and meditate in some way. Try this. Whatever you do, try to let go of an idea of yourself. Just be totally aware and conscious and involve yourself in the activity. This is really meditation. And you'll see yourself loosening up automatically. And you'll be more content. To really forgive, you need to understand that everyone is looking for "something" and that's why we do things. Some inexplicable happiness. To express ourselves. Even criminals do so. In trying to look for happiness outside, we get misguided and do unnecessary things. This includes things like alcohol or drugs. It is a satisfying-the-ego nature. This happiness is not true happiness. We try to fit in with the crowd or friends to be "accepted" to be happier. Edit: This can also go the other way. Disillusionment with life could indicate more focus, or blowing up the suffering/disappointing/frustrating aspects. With a cool rationality and temperament by mindfulness/awareness, we can gain more equanimity. To really see bliss and happiness, look inward and make yourself that way. By being more open to pleasantness and reducing the ego qualities, you won't ever have to look outside. 

Neither a man nor a woman can become a Buddha. Only a Bodhisattva having completed the necessary parami can become a Buddha. In that last life of the Bodhisattva, the Bodhisattva takes on a masculine shape. This is what is said in the Theravada texts. 

Should Buddhists use statues with an imagined likeness of the Buddha for veneration? The Buddha discouraged making images in his likeness (Kalinga Bodhi jataka), and has said that the Buddha cannot be likened to a statue. 

One difference between a Sammasambuddha and Paccekkabuddha is that, the former, at a point of been capable of achieving Enlightenment, postpones his Enlightenment so that he can become a Bodhisattva to instruct and inspire many beings during many life times, and thus help a large number of beings eradicate craving (the origin of suffering). Thus over the supposedly billions of lifetimes as a Bodhisatva the Bodhisatva gets to know and learns about the various tendencies of the multitude of beings s/he instructs, and thus is able to preach the dhamma accordingly. The latter had no such intention, and no such training in teaching. That is not to say that Paccekabuddhas are incapable of giving any instruction or inspiring others. However, the body of teaching is not comprehensive or complete like a Sammasambuddha. 

Did Gautama Buddha make any statements about the justices or injustices of the world? I would like to elucidate the right view to a person who has undergone a certain injustice. The person in question has not got a particular position she rightfully deserved due to a conspiracy of people blocking said person from achieving it. I would also like a parallel to the contemporary world so that it is more practical when reaching this society's person. 

You don't believe in any God. Ok. You don't believe in rituals. Ok. Very likely you already don't. So why Buddhism? I'd like to make an important point here stating that Buddhism is anything but a religion. The right question to ask would be why would you want to follow anything at all. You will find many answers here that will give you sources and some googling will give you additional reading. "Access to insight" is one place to read some suttas and translations. But I would say some practical advice is worth it. Get a cushion, or a straight backed chair, or sit on the floor cross legged. With spine erect. Close your eyes lightly. Make sure you're comfortable. Take 3-4 deep breaths. This gets your system responding to you. Then start normal breathing. Watch your breath go in and out of you. You could start by observing the stomach going in and out with breathing. Don't force it. And then do a body scan top to bottom and bottom to top, loosening up any tight or tense areas. Come back to the breath going in and out. You could alternatively focus your attention on the breath at the tip of your nose. During this time you may find that your mind keeps on coming up with one thought after another. If it doesn't, you're my God ;) Ignore those thoughts and come back to the breath. Try this for sometime and then gradually increase the time. And then go for additional reading sources gradually. Apart from this, my advice would be not to get into any complicated concepts which is not yet in your experience. This is a pitfall. Because that will just send your mind into unnecessary spirals and get you nowhere. Metta and good luck with your practice. 

We find the below and similar pairs in the Tikandika Sutta (A 5.144) â€œIt is good, bhikshus, that one were to dwell from time to time perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive" In the Maha kamma vibhanga sutta we find the Buddha describing the complexities of kamma and to an extent admonishes from making categorical claims about the effects of kamma. 

It's important that lay Buddhists keep the Uposatha practice, or at least once a week avoid all sexual activity, including masturbation. Sakka Sutta: To the Sakyans (on the Uposatha) AN 10.46 

One would have thought that the breath would have been the simplest of objects to meditate upon :) Well it is. The first 4 steps of being mindful of the in-breath and out-breath according to the Ananapanasati Sutta are 

That would be an unfortunate situation. Many 'Buddhist countries' have and are fighting wars where people who are Buddhists are engaged in warfare. What can a Buddhist do if he is conscripted? Not all Buddhists are at the same level of virtue, tranquility and wisdom. So it would depend. Some may refuse to kill and harm and face the consequences. Others may seeks vocations which does not involve killing. However, if you are to go to the front Be mindful Accept responsibility Never 'delight' in killing or harming, even an enemy Contemplate the drawbacks of hate, the ego, self-views (collective and individually) Once a week keep the Uposatha practice (re: Visakha uposatha sutta) Practice metta (to one's colleagues and even the enemy, remembering that one could have born into the other side, and be fighting his current comrades.) Samsara is a dangerous place, there are many times and places where hearing and practicing the Dhamma is impossible. So it is also worth considering to contemplate 'what do buddhists do in situations which are conducive for the Dhamma?'. Many waste such rare opportunities, squander it chasing after sensual pleasures and feeding the ego. 

Its very simple. If your goal is the spiritual path, you must do well to not harm yourself, or other people mindlessly. Alcohol used for intoxication is not good for this purpose. If you're looking for a good time just generally, socially, it is okay in small amounts. You won't do much wrong because it is moderate. In this regard, I also have something to say about abstaining from alcohol. You can still have a nice time without it and don't need to depend on it unless it is a social stigma. This includes things like excess of love or lustful feelings. If you are mindful of what you want to do, you will understand what to do. :) With alcohol/drugs, there is a tendency to go mindless and do "weird" things. Without alcohol/drugs, you have your senses firmly with you and you can control your actions well. Which part of this did you not understand? Its not a rule. It is a basic understanding or reasoning of what your goal is, and what your action should be. Thus, it very clearly depends on which path you are taking, either spiritual or material. The path is the goal. PS: I see NUMEROUS questions about the precepts on this site. Don't get too technical about what is mentioned and what is not mentioned in the texts. That will become endless interpretation. Measure yourself and your goal and you will automatically know the actions you need to take up. 

Gautma Buddha is said to have been a Bodhisatva for several hundreds of thousands of aeons. The Theravada school usually says that these extremely long periods are required by a Buddha to train oneself. If we assume that the training took 1,000,000,000,000 years and he taught as a Buddha for 45 years, then the training to teaching ratio is extremely ineffective. The Mahayana school says that Bodhisatvas could have become Arhats way before that but intentionally delayed this decision out of compassion to countless of beings. Hence, these extremely long periods are required by a Bodhisatva not necessarily to to train oneself, but to train others. Therefore the state of Bodhisatva is a special delay mechanism to allow a future Buddha to continue in the cycle of life and death, and gradually train countless of beings into Unbinding from the cycle of death. 

This was meant to be a comment, but it exceeded the word limit, so posted it as an answer. The world (loke) is like a tar ball. You get stuck to it if you cling to it's sensual baits, and you still get stuck to it if you get into conflict with it. The middle path (this is not a statistically average way) is to see the tar ball's true nation, i.e. a volatile unpredictable place with repeated births and deaths, and let go of attachment to the world and any conflict towards the world. Practicing the middle path, one will become unbound from the tar ball. Mr. Piya Tan's translation and commentary of the Kaccayanagotta Sutta (S 12.15) explains on what really is the middle way. $URL$ 

I don't know if there is a answer to this. But I would think it is more common sense. It really depends on you're doing. Some acts require careful before it is done. A little thought before speaking to a person, or if you're doing something like writing or programming, which are mental skills, is good. Since you mentioned and Bruce Lee, I'd say martial arts has a way of repetitive action, in other words, a combination of moves being practised repeatedly, so that it just occurs naturally. Going with the flow is crucial. Now, or in the middle of that, may cause you to check the action unnecessarily when it is going correctly, consequentially the occurs, which may be detrimental, in that context. That's why all the thinking is done before-hand in martial arts practice, and unbroken, smooth repetition is of paramount importance. (Commenting on movies would be inessential here. I'd advise you to take anything you hear in them with a pinch of salt. The dialogues may be used for rather than ) In conclusion, it really depends on the situation you're in. Be present in the moment and do mindfully what the situation entails. If you're sitting in meditation practice, and letting go would help because that's the whole point of meditation. The mind's activity needs to be calmed, if I may say so. That's where and letting go helps. In regular activities, just know where you are, be alert and aware of what you're doing, that is mindfulness. And the effect is that you're able to do things more productively (which is generally a good thing). 

Aware that the in-breath is long one breathes in / aware that the out-breath is long one breathes out Aware that the in-breath is short one breathes in / aware that the out-breath is short one breathes out 

In the Bhaya Bherava Sutta MN 4 translated by Bhikkhu Tannissaro this is stated as said by the Buddha. "There are some brahmans & contemplatives, brahman, who have the perception of 'day' when it is night, and of 'night' when it is day. This, I tell you, is their being in a dwelling of delusion. As for me, I have the perception of 'day' when it is day, and of 'night' when it is night..." However in the Capala Sutta A 7.58 and several other suttas the Buddha encourages meditators to develop the perception of light so that one "dwells by night as by day, and by day as by night." How are we to reconcile these two statements? 

Vanijja Sutta - On Business $URL$ Even if one is very busy with work, try to incorporate generosity, even encouraging words, an uplifting smile, live a harmless and balanced life, speak kind and truthful words, devote some time to dhamma study (say even 15 mins of reading the suttas), practice and develop even one of the four factors of mindfulness, or even one of the four right efforts, occassinally reflect on one of the three characteristics, or the dependent origination, such a person can be said to be devoted to the Dhamma. 

Why not? Simply read? Take what you feel is right? There are many explanations. You may be mislead. That's why I said simply read. Don't stop yourself from reading/exploring. But why should you get carried away by what's in the books of a person? Most importantly, start reading your own life. Look at what's happening to you in situations, how you react, how you respond, what you are doing. Take conscious actions. That will give you more than enough knowledge on what you need than all the books in the world. 

Zen is indescribable. Where do you get these thoughts like zen has some rules or attitudes towards anything you do apart from maybe sitting meditation? Look most of the things we do in this world has not much point apart from the ideas and concepts we are creating in our minds. I don't see why journal keeping is any different unless you unsuccessfully try to write Zen everyday in your journal. Let's take for example tea-making. It is done with great attention and care and sipped with great attention and care. Such a simple thing is a ceremony. So, you could also sit there and write a journal with focus and attention if you would like to. Why are you bothered about Zen? Throw it and write your journal.
