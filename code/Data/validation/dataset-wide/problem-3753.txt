I am very surprised that nobody mentioned the REAL reason why mathematicians are so much interested in billiards. It comes from mechanics (celestial mechanics, first of all), and the first question considered was that of existence of periodic trajectories. Which correspond to periodic orbits in mechanics. G. Birkhoff in "Dynamical systems" explains: "Before we give an example illustrating applications of Poincare theorem and its generalizations, let us consider first of all a special but very typical problem of this sort, namely the problem of motion of a billiard ball on a table which is bounded by a convex curve. This system is of a great interest for the following reasons. Every Lagrangian system with two degrees of freedom, ... etc." For an easily available source, see Birkhoff, On the periodic motions of dynamical systems, Acta math., 48, 1927. 

Under your assumption on the potential, there is indeed such a unique solution, (I assume you mean $x\to+\infty$ in your boundary condition. This is proved by reducing your differential equation to an integral one, which is solved by the method of successive approximations. See, for example, V. A. Marchenko, Sturm-Liouville operators and applications, (Translated from the Russian) Birkhauser 1986. Chapter 3 Lemma 3.1.1. 

This is always helpful if the proof is long and complicated. Some experts may need only this to understand the proof. Some people may read only some steps, once they have the general idea. Those who prefer to read only the full detail, can always skip this informal description. So I do not see any arguments against this, except the increased length of the paper. But this is rarely a problem. I usually do this in long papers. 

In the case of $1\times 1$ matrices, and $b\neq 0$, your equation is $y'=ay+by^2$, which is never globally stable. 

Here is a slightly different version of Venkataramanas answer to my question. Let's say that $f$ omits $g$ if $f(z)$ is never equal to $g(z)$. Let $G$ be the group of fractional linear transformations such that the unit disc $U$ modulo $G$ is C\ { 0,1 } . (Can anyone suggest a short and recognizable name for this group?? This is a truly fundamental object of complex analysis, and the shortest name for it that I know is the "principal congruence subgroup of level 2 of the modular group". Sounds scary for many people). Proposition. TFAE: There exists $f$ holomorphic in $U$ that omits $0,1,\infty$ and $\lambda(z)$, and: there exists $g: U\to U$ that omits all elements of $G$. Proof. $f=\lambda\circ g$. Now it is well-known that there exists $f$ holomorphic in $U$ which omits $0,1,\infty$ and $\lambda$. This is by "extension of holomorphic families of injections" of Slodkowski. The theorem of Slodkowski says that whenever you have any number of holomorphic functions in $U$ with disjoint graphs, you can add one whose graph is disjoint from those given functions. And even prescribe the value of this one added function at one point. Of course, Venkataramana's answer is better because it gives an explicit construction. This new answer shows that this is a special case of a well-known and important general principle. Somehow I did not figure this out before the Aakumadula's answer. EDIT on Feb 19 2013. Multi-valued function $f(z)=\sqrt{z}$ omits $0,1,\infty$ and $f(z)=z$ has no solutions in $C\backslash${0,1}. Thus the composition of $f$ with the universal cover {$\{ |z|<1\}$} to $C\backslash${0,1} omits $0,1,\infty$ and all elements of the Schwarz's group. 

The usual Cauchy-Hadamard formula has a generalization to several variables. The numbers $r_1,\ldots,r_n$ are called conjugate radii of convergence if the series converges in the open polydisk $B(r_1,\ldots,r_n)$ and diverges in $\{ z:|z_j|>r_j, 1\leq j\leq n\}$. Then we have the formula $$\limsup_{|k|\to\infty}\left(|c_{k_1\ldots,k_n}|r_1^{k_1}\ldots r_n^{k_n}\right)^{|k|}=1,$$ where $|k|=k_1+\ldots+k_n.$ Reference: B. A. Fuks, Theory of analytic functions of several variables, vol. I, Chap. I, sect 3, Theorem 3.7. 

The relevant result is a theorem of Weierstrass which says that if $f$ is meromorphic (of one variable), and satisfies an addition theorem $$f(x+y)=F(f(x),f(y)),$$ then $f$ is elliptic (possibly degenerate). The converse is also true. The a priori assumption that $f$ is meromorphic can be substantially relaxed with the same conclusion. Thus we are reduced to describing all possible addition formulas for elliptic curves, and I do not think that there is an explicit answer. 

Let $C$ be a complex line in $C^2$, say $y=0$. Project it on $x$-line, all properties are satisfied:-) If you really want "connected, but ONLY if one goes near the origin", take the set $\{(x,y): y^2=x(x-1)\}$ and project it on the $x$ coordinate. This is a non-singular curve. If you remove a compact set out of it, it becomes disconnected. There is no way "to jump between the sheets" of the square root away from the segment $[0,1]$. 

For this equation to have solutions, it is not enough that $l$ is subharmonic. It must be logarithmically subharmonic which means that $\log l$ is subharmonic. Now if $l$ is logarithmically subharmonic, the nesessary and sufficient condition that $f$ exists in a simply connected domain is that the measure $(2\pi)^{-1}\Delta\log l$ is discrete and integer-valued. If the solution exists it is always unique up to a constant factor $e^{i\theta}$. EDIT. To prove sufficiency, one uses the Weierstrass representation. Suppose that $l$ is logarithmically subharmonic and $(2\pi)^{-1}\Delta\log l$ is a discrete integer-valued measure with atoms $m_k$ at the points $a_k$. Consider the Weierstrass product $f$ with zeros $a_k$ of multiplicity $m_k$. This $f$ is an entire function. Now $u:=\log l-\log|f|$ is harmonic, by construction. Let $v$ be such harmonic function that $g:=u+iv$ is entire. Then $l=|f\exp g|.$ 

The question in dimension $2$ is equivalent to: how many trajectories of the differential equation $$z'=\sum_{j=1}^n\frac{a_j}{\overline{z-z_j}}$$ pass through infinity. Here $a_j$ are real and their sum is $0$. It looks like in general (for generic masses and mass positions) you will have two trajectories passing through infinity. If the system I wrote reflects the question correctly, make the change of the variable $w=1/z$. I obtained $$w'=-w|w|^2\sum_{j=1}^n\frac{a_k}{1-\overline{wz_k}}=-c|w|^4+\ldots,$$ because sum of $a_k$ is $0$. If $$c=\sum_{k=1}^na_k\overline{z_k}\neq 0$$ (generic case) this has two trajectories beginning or ending at $w=0$. In the non-generic case, you can have more. If $c=0$, we will have $$w'=-c_1w^4\overline{w}+\ldots$$ where $$c_1=\sum a_k\overline{z_k}^2.$$ If $c_1\neq 0$, we have $4$ trajectories passing through $0$. And so on. 

First of all, the problem can have no solution. Consider intervals $I_n=(0,n)$. No matter how you color them with $k$ colors there will be infinite families with same color and non-empty intersection. To make the problem meaningful, you must first specify whether your intervals are open or closed (or else), and second, impose some additional restrictions. 

A simply connected region with 4 marked boundary points is called a quadrilateral. A conformal map of quadrilaterals is a conformal map of the regions which sends the marked boundary points to the marked boundary points. Each quadrilateral is conformally equivalent to a rectangle with vertices marked (this is a simple exercise with Schwarz and Christoffel). A square is characterized (among all rectangles) by the property that it has a conformal automorphism which acts on the vertices cyclically (1 to 2 to 3 to 4 to 1, with natural enumeration). This automorphism is just a rotation by $90$ degrees. The upper half of the Teichmuller ring in question is the upper half-plane with $-1,0,1,\infty$ marked. It has a conformal automorphism $f(z)=(1+z)/(1-z)$ which maps $-1\to 0\to 1\to\infty\to -1$. Therefore this quadrilateral is conformally equivalent to a square. 

On mathematical theories which became obsolete because better theories were invented. An example is "vector calculus" which is still taught to all undergraduates for the reasons that escape me. It is superceded by much simpler formalism of differential forms. (Poor students still have to memorize the complicated expression in Stokes' theorem in the Stokes original formulation!) 

I am not sure what you are asking in your first question (what is a "unit triangulation" ?) but one can prove the following: There is no geodesic triangulation of the plane with all vertices of degree >6 and such that the following conditions holds: b) the angles of triangles are bounded from below. Condition b) means that each triangle is bi-Lipshitz to an equilateral triangle, so this is probably what you ask. And the reason you mention is valid. Examples of geodesic triangulation with vertices of degree 7 are given in the previous answer, and it follows from, b) that some triangles in these examples are very thin. Edited later. My first answer also had condition a) all triangles are bounded. I claimed that b) can be replaced with a). This condition CANNOT be used to replace b). Here is an example of a geodesic trianglation of the plane with all vertices of arbitrarily high degree, and bounded triangles. Begin with an equilateral triange inscribed in the unit circle. From each vertex draw segments from the unit circle to the concentric circle of radius 2, so that the degree of each vertex on the unit circle becomes large. Add some chords of the circle of radius 2, connecting the endpoints of these segmnts. Draw additional segments to make this a triangulation of some polygon inscribed in the circle of radius 2. All inner vertices of this triangulation have large degree. Now repeat this construction. We obtain a sequence of larger and larger polygons $P_n$ each inscribed in a circle of radius $n$, and each polygon is triangulated so that the degrees of inner vertices is large. Continuing this indefinitely, we obtain a triangulation of the plane. 

This is true for real analytic functions $f:R^2\to R$. Let such a function be $f(x,y)$ and we consider the level set $f(x,y)=0$, that is an analytic curve. If at some point $f_x$ or $f_y$ is different from $0$, this point is non-singular and belongs to your set $S$. Now we show that a singular point is a common endpoint of an even number of branches of the curve. Let this singular point be $O=(0,0)$. According to Newton and Puiseux, the curve near $O$ is given by finitely many series of the form $y=(c+o(1))x^{p/q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are positive integers, $c\neq 0$. Each such series defines an even number of branches. If one of $p$, $q$ is even, the principal term is invariant either under $x\mapsto-x$ or $y\mapsto -y$. If both are odd, use $(x,y)\mapsto (-x,-y)$ So we have an even number of branches converging at each singular point. (For a reference, you can look at "Puiseux series" entry in Wikipedia, or any book which has "algebraic curves" in the title. There is no difference between algebraic and analytic curves in this respect). EDIT. I asked the specialists in singularities, and they told me that this is true in any dimension, as a corollary of a much more general fact proved by Sullivan in: MR0278333 Sullivan, D. Combinatorial invariants of analytic spaces. 1971 Proceedings of Liverpool Singularities—Symposium, I (1969/70) pp. 165–168 Springer, Berlin. EDIT2. Another reference: Real algebraic geometry" by Bochnak, Coste, Roy, Corollary 11.2.4. It is stated for algebraic case but actually there is no difference, according to Thm 8.6.12 of the same book. 

There exists a complete theory for minimal $L^\infty$ norm polynomials on two intervals. It is due to N. I. Akhiezer. You can look at his books: Lectures on Approximation theory or, another book, Elliptic functions. There is also a nice survey paper on this problem for any number of intervals, by Sodin and Yuditskii, Functions that deviate least from zero on closed subsets of the real axis. Algebra i Analiz 4 (1992), no. 2, 1--61. 

Yes. See, for example, W. Abikoff, Real analytic theory of Teichmuller space, Springer, 1980, Chap. II, section 1.5 Theorem 2. 

As Adam said in his answer, by Riemann Hurwitz, if the genus is greater than 1, every holomorphic covering must be biholomorphic. But biholomorphic maps certainly exist. (Contrary to what is stated in the question, different points of the Teichmuller space can be bihilomorphically equivalent). They form a group acting on the Teichmuller space called the Modular group, which acts on the Teichmuller space (and in general has fixed points). The factor over this group is called the moduli space, and the group itself has been very well studied. 

The answer is yes, if $\alpha$ is increasing. Take any $x_0$ and define $x_{n+1}=f(x_n)$. Then $|x_{n+1}-x_n|\leq k^n|x_1-x_0|$ where $k=\alpha(|x_1-x_0|)<1.$ Indeed, we have $$|x_{n+1}-x_n|\leq\alpha(|x_{n}-x_{n-1}|)|x_{n}-x_{n-1}|.$$ In particular, $|x_{n+1}-x_n|\leq|x_n-x_{n-1}|$, from which follows by induction that $|x_{n+1}-x_n|\leq|x_1-x_0|.$ So we can continue the previous inequality: $$|x_{n+1}-x_n|\leq k|x_{n}-x_{n-1}|,$$ and again by induction $$|x_{n+1}-x_n|\leq k^n|x_1-x_0|,$$ Therefore the series $$\sum|x_{n+1}-x_n|$$ is majorized by a geometric progression, and it follows that $x_n$ is a Cauchy sequence. (I use notation $|x-y|$ for the distance, even if $x-y$ is not defined.) 

Erdos's problem on the length of lemniscates (it is somewhat famous in certain narrow circles). Let $P$ be a polynomial, and consider the set $E=\{ z:|P(z)|=1\}$ in the complex plane. 

I am amazed with your statement that "a recent article pointed...". I suspect his fact was known to the Greeks about 2000 years ago, and it is certainly mentioned in every serious trigonometry textbook. On your question. The corresponding quantity for the spherical triangle even has a name: "modulus of the triangle", M. There is a symmetric expression $$M^2=\frac{1-\cos^2a-\cos^2b-\cos^2c+2\cos a\cos b\cos c}{\sin^2a\sin^2b\sin^2c},$$ where $a,b,c$ are the sides. Modulus plays a role in various theorems. For example, If the modulus is greater than $1$, then either all 3 sides are greater than 90 degrees, or exactly one of the sides is less than 90 degrees. Modulus is equal to the ratio of absolute values of two determinants: $M=|\delta/\Delta|$ where $\delta$ is the determinant of the three unit vectors pointing from the center of the unit sphere to the vertices, and $\Delta$ is the determinant of the three unit vectors which are pointing to the vertices of the polar (dual) triangle. For this fact, see M. Berger, Geometrie, vol. 2. (The relatively modern book covering the subject). The most comprehensive book in English is W. Cahuvenet, A treatease on Plane and Spherical trigonometry, Philadephia 1850. (Poincare once said that this book contains everything one may want to know on the subject:-) EDIT. Just found more information on this quantity. Will just give a reference: Study, Spharische Trigonometrie, orthogonale Substitutionen und elliptische Funktionen, Leipzig, 1893.
