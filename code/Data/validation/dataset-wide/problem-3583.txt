Generally, you want to take in about 20g of protein and some carbs after any workout, particularly resistance-training, sprints, and high-intensity cardio. This is the point at which your muscles are in their greatest state of recovery, and having a high-protein environment is important for that. Some people may choose to take BCAA in lieue of a post-workout meal. As long as you eat some complete protein or take BCAA, it should speed up muscle-recovery. If you take creatine, it's also recommended that this be done immediately after a workout. 

In addition to the points made above, HIIT also has the added benefit of EPOC to recover from oxygen deficit during the anaerobic "sprinting" stage. That can increase your metabolic rate up to 13% for up to 48 hours (decreasing over time). The optimal way to lose fat is a good combination of aerobic, anaerobic, and HIIT exercises. HIIT will give you the most bang for your buck and result in a heightened metabolic rate long after your workout. Strength training will have a similar effect, due to the added stress on the body of repairing muscle tissue. The real benefit from strength training is that it helps prevent muscle loss while you're at a calorie deficit. Strength training will also increase your levels of Human Growth Hormone and Insulin Growth Factor. Deficiencies in HGH/IGF have been shown to cause excess fat, and increasing them will help burn fat especially around the abdominal area (belly fat). Like HIIT, cardio/aerobic exercise will burn extra calories and increase your metabolism during the exercise and for a shorter time afterward. HOWEVER the true benefit of cardio is that it increases your metabolic efficiency over time. In other words, the more cardio you do, the more efficient your body becomes at using fat for energy. You could technically lose weight without doing any cardio at all, but it's important for maintaining the calorie deficit and getting the most effect out of your exercise routine over time. Summary: 

I've been going to gym for about 3-4 month now. In my diet I tried to eat 2g of protein per 1kg of body mass, ~0.5g of fat per 1kg of body mass, and keep my calories intake >= calories burned overall. I gained some mass (both muscle and fat presumably). The training program was mainly 4 sets of 8-12 reps, with following exercises(3 days a week): 

Is it okay to hold dumbbell in right hand for right leg squats, and vice-versa (it feels most comfortable for me). Or should I use 1 dumbbell for each hand? 

Suppose I stopped increasing weights at certain point, and routine and diet is fixed, will I keep my form? People often write that routine needs to be changed often. How can this routine be changed in order to reduce overall time of training? Also, now I'm taking a forced break from training due to wrist injury(it's going to be a month or two), I'm on a small caloric deficit and visually losing some fat and muscles. What are best strategies to recover to the same form I had before break after I start exercising again? 

I can only speak from experience as someone else that usually works out a few hours before going to sleep. I often have the same problem, particularly after cardio due to the elevated heartrate, but sometimes after weightlifting too. The best thing you can do for yourself is to establish a night-routine that will help relax your body between a workout and sleep. Personally, I just read for an hour before I go to bed (preferably fiction, not a technical book). This should bring down all of your vitals and allow you to fall asleep more easily. A cup of decaf tea/coffee also helps. Try to avoid carbs right before bed if you have a post-workout snack/meal. I fall asleep easier if I just eat something with protein like nuts or edamame. Your muscles will likely be tense after a workout, which can also prevent sleep. To help this, I'd recommend self-massage, otherwise known as myofascial release. This works EXTREMELY well for me, and it's quite relaxing (a bit painful). Your gym likely has some of these foam rollers in stock. If not, you can purchase one cheap on Amazon. 

Felt stiffness in my lower back during a week or so(during bent over barbell rows and squats mainly), but didn't pay much attention to it. Yesterday however I couldn't finish my 4x12 bent over barbell row, because of it. So, I skipped it and did the following exercises fine (lat pull-down, seated row, seated cable row etc). A guy in the gym told me that it is typical and that I should wear belt during bent over barbell rows. Is he right? Should I do some special exercises to strengthen lower back (hyperextension f. e.)? Is it okay to do squats tomorrow? (with stiff lower back) 

I'm taking a forced break (about 2-3 weeks) from weightlifting after several months of training. How much are my strength and volume going to drop and at what pace should I start training after coming back? Also is it beneficial to keep protein consumption the same (2g per 1kg) during the break or I should decrease it? Can I use this time to lose some fat and go for calories deficit without losing muscles? 

Due to my schedule I start workout at about 20:00 and finish around 22:00. I have to get up at 7:00 so I have a dilemma of not wanting to eat much before I go to sleep and the need to eat protein and carbs after workout. I usually have breakfast at 8:30(carbs) and lunch around 13:00(fair amount of protein) and some small amount of carbs before workout. So I definitely need a protein meal after workout, but I just don't sleep well after that. What can I do without rescheduling my workout time? 

Sites like bodybuilding.com, Men's Fitness, Muscle & Strength, etc. still use terms such as "endomorph, "ectomorph" and "mesomorph". These so-called "somatotypes" were invented by the psychologist (and possible eugenicist) William Herbert Sheldon, Jr. Sheldon tied each of the bodytypes to certain personality traits, and his research has been discredited time and again as racist hogwash. That being said, if so many of these respected fitness websites make reference to the somatotypes, is it because we've since proven there to be some accuracy to the distinct body types without the connection to personality? Or is this just a case of bad science being hard to wash away. 

The short answer is yes, it's overestimating your calorie burn. But it's unlikely the sole reason that you're having trouble losing weight. Most exercise machines overestimate calorie burn, and ellipticals are among the worst offenders. Studies have shown that they can overestimate calorie burn by as much as 40%. A more reasonable expectation for someone of your weight might be 100 calories burned per 10 minutes (assuming a moderate pace). Because it's difficult to precisely know how many calories you burn throughout the day (BMR and exercise machines are not 100% accurate), it may be a good idea to give yourself wiggle room when it comes to your calorie intake. These calculations have a lot more room for error at body weights approaching 135kg and higher, especially if you have a high body-fat ratio. Try to aim for a calorie deficit of 1000 instead of 500, and estimate 300 calories burned for 30 minutes on the elliptical. If this is too difficult and/or you lose more than 1kg per week, you can adjust it. 

I've heard that it's useful to determine your weakest muscle group and to work more on it. Sometimes it can been clearly seen, but if not, how do I actually do it? Is there some approximate proportions of weights in different exercises to find out which muscle groups is relatively weaker? 

When I'm doing squats my knees go forward further than my toes. Also when I'm standing up I tend to move weight more towards my toes. I was told that this technique is wrong but it seems like I can't make squats without knees moving forward even without weight. Could it have something to do with flat feet? 

When I started going to gym, it happened that I had chest+shoulders+biceps day, back+triceps day and legs day. But I've heard many times that people tend to do chest+triceps because triceps works during bench press and the same for back+biceps during pull-ups. I tried doing triceps after chest and were able to do fewer reps(on dips) and less weight/reps on crossover triceps. So, is it really good to combine chest with triceps, even if weights decrease? 

Carbo loading is generally recommended for endurance events - anything longer than 90 minutes at a moderate pace. In addition, carbo-loading typically has to be done several days in advance. It's possible to glean benefits from carbo-loading the day before, but only if you've been actively maintaining your glycogen stores by replenishing them after excercising. Basically, a 5k run isn't long enough to use up your glycogen stores unless you're really not getting enough carbs in your diet, so the carbo-loading is kind of pointless. It also depends on the type of foods that you're using for your carbohydrates. Grains can negatively impact your performance, especially wheat glutens which create inflammation. The general recommendation for eating before a 5k is simply to eat a good meal 3-4 hours before the event. Something with complex-carbohydrates - e.g. fruit and whole grains - not simple carbs like sugar, as this can spike your insulin levels and make you sluggish. If you wanted to feel what it's like to run out of glycogen during a run, I'd suggest doing a 20k (or half-marathon). Without carbo-loading beforehand, you'll likely deplete your energy stores and enter a state of low blood-sugar (aka "hitting the wall") about 15km or 90 minutes into it. Over time, endurance training increases the amount of glycogen that your body can store, so you can run longer before hitting the wall, as long as your glycogen stores are full. 

After the latest legs day I had pain in the inner side of the place between leg and groin. It hurts only during the lowers part of the squat and press machine (I didn't notice anything during that workout thought). I didn't pay much attention to it, however after a week on the next legs day I felt it during the warm-up squats with empty barbell and when I put the weight I couldn't perform because of it. So I skipped squats and press machine and only did other machines for legs ( and it didn't hurt there ). Is it a sprain and what do I do about it? When can I start squatting again? 

I increased weights somewhere about when I could do 4х10 with current weights. Now I'm going to go for caloric deficit (~300-500kcal) (with same 2g of protein and ~0.5g of fat per 1kg of body mass, but less carbs) to reduce body fat and keep as much strength and volume as possible. How should I approach my workout routine in this period? I suppose adding weight is not a good idea on caloric deficit? (I do realize my routine was not ideal from the start) 

3-5 grams of creatine per day (1 of your pills) is generally considered a safe amount. There has been evidence of liver/kidney damage as a result of taking too much Creatine, but seems to only be the case with people who already have kidney/liver problems. Studies have shown that as much as 20 grams of creatine per day is safe. The only real downside is water retention (i.e., bloating). Taking a lot of creatine will cause an average person to gain around 5 lbs in water-weight (which will only go away when you stop taking creatine). Humans typically get half of their Creatine from meat, specifically red meat, so it's definitely more important for vegetarians. You may choose to do an initial "loading phase" where you take 2-3 of those pills per day for 1-2 weeks to build up your initial stores. Then you can maintain your Creatine stores on 1 of those pills per day. On the flipside, you may want to consider doing your maintenance on only half a pill per day. 2 grams is shown to still be effective, while minimizing water retention. A lot of bodybuilders choose to "cycle" their Creatine. They may only use it for a month, and then not use it again for 2 months. They use it professionally as a supplement for beating personal plateaus. But whether you want to cycle it or use it daily is up to you.
