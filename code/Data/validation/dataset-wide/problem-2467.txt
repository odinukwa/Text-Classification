As for the Pali, the word in question here is Akataññū. According to $URL$ or (similarly) $URL$ apparently that verse is difficult to translate without the commentary: and I think they're saying that Akataññū is some kind of play on words: i.e. it usually means something like, "not knowing what's created for one's benefit (therefore ungrateful)"; and here, it means, "knowing what's not created (i.e. Nibbana)". 

The Buddha's most famous sutta about "not-self" is the Anatta-lakkhana Sutta (SN 22.59). There are various things (called Skandhas) which you might (mistakenly) think of as self: 

The emperor became Buddhist: $URL$ According to Wikipedia, the Maurya Empire started in 320 BC; and Siddhartha Gautama died in about 400 BC plus or minus a few decades; so, that empire started (only) about 50 or 100 years after the Siddhartha Gautama's death. The pilgrimage sites on the map you quoted are places associated with Siddhartha Gautama's life (after which, the "popularity" of Buddhism extended beyond those places). 

I post that as evidence that people do find (and/or have written) that kind of attitude or explanation in some scriptures. I'm unable to identify exactly what he's quoting, though (The Scripture on the Benefits of the Five Trainings), or to find that translation elsewhere. Anyway, according to that you may be reborn as "queer men" for the same kind of reason as you may be reborn as "women"; or as animals, in hell, or as ghosts. 

I think it's conventionally useful to identify 'the agent' of an action, for example, "Whose turn is it to wash the dishes?" implies there's a someone who'll be doing that (more or less reliably). People (or people's feelings) are also nouned when they're used as the object of a sentence, for example, "I hurt him." Personal identity (including family) are also important (in law/jurisprudence) in assigning ownership of property, for example, "Who owns this land?", and inheritance etc. 

Note that Buddhism isn't the only cure; for example the current Dalai Lama's long life might also be attributed to his medical care, careful diet, regular exercise etc. 

Buddhism does promise release from suffering: that's The Third Noble Truth The "end" isn't only by "not taking a rebirth": the Buddhist argument is that suffering is caused by desire/craving; and that stilling craving and letting go of attachment (to a false self) will end suffering. No desire also results in no rebirth, but it's the "no desire", the "control of mind", the "wisdom" which causes or results in "cessation of suffering". In other words the argument is, "no desire implies the cessation of suffering (in this life), and no rebirth (in the next life)". The argument is not, "no desire implies no rebirth, which implies no suffering in the next life, but meanwhile you cannot affect your suffering in this life". A tamed mind brings happiness. 

I'm not sure that Buddhist countries allow "conscientious objectors" to refuse conscription into the military service. Looking through the list of countries with conscription, which you posted in the question: 

Buddhist monks I think that the vinaya forbids monks to dig: see Destroying Vegetation. That depends on the school/tradition though, e.g. in some countries where the lay society doesn't support the monks, the monks might do agriculture themselves. Jains There's some historical relationship between Buddhism and the Jains. Perhaps Gautama studied with Jain teachers before his enlightenment? Jainism takes ahimsa to a level beyond that in Buddhist doctrine, e.g. vegetarianism is mandatory and it forbids the eating of roots etc. Tiny animals I think too I read something of someone visiting Tibet a while ago and reporting that people there were careful about how they dug: very slowly, wanting to avoid hurting worms and so on that live in the soil. Similarly here's a sentence from Wikipedia's description of Jainism, 

There's a chapter titled Alcohol as Medicine or Poison: in one of his books which is titled The Heart of the Buddha. 

My mother and I come from a non-Buddhist culture/background/society/country/family. At one point when I had an opportunity to explain to her what Buddhism is, I was doing well (i.e. she was listening and accepting what I was saying) when I was explaining that Buddhism includes a non-fixed identity-view and explaining why a non-fixed identity view is skillful (e.g. because an attitude such as attachment to your job/profession might be unpleasant when you retire, and because people's abilities and health change with age). But then what I mentioned the first Noble Truth she seemed to object, saying "Sorry you think life is suffering/dissatisfaction, I don't agree: I like life, I think life is good." 

I may be wrong but looking at the video, the little girl's face seems to me smiley (happy) while her hands (limbs) are shaking. She seemed to me happy that she's having a novel experience. That doesn't look like horror to me: it looks like, I don't know, an adrenaline rush or something like that. Her voice sounds whispery, I suspect that's because her heart is pounding (high breathing and heart rate). I thought she seemed to be enjoying or at least intrigued by the experience: it's as if her dad had given her amphetamines. 

I guess too that you want to talk in a way that gets the other person to participate in the conversation. A trivial (exaggerated) example might be to start the conversation with: 

Note too that there are different kinds of "desire": for example, unvirtuous craving, and a more virtuous desire for liberation -- see, for example, How to develop Chanda? 

The word which Thanissaro Bhikkhu translated as "dispassion", e.g. starting this sutta, is virāgā. And, 

Reading that, maybe you could say that another "cost" (or maybe "prerequisite") is "knowing Dhamma": i.e. time, effort, attention required to learn and to practice the Dhamma. 

Within the Pali suttas I recommend the Bhikkhuni Sutta and the Brahmana Sutta. Even though something (such as desire, for example, or conceit) is to be abandoned in the end it may be, if used rightly (if it has a right goal, or intention), a means ("by relying on it") for arriving there. 

So you think it would help to define a chariot by its function or use? Is that (the chariot's being used as a means for transportation) the chariot's permanent soul? I personally found that kind of thinking (that objects have an eternal soul) useless and implausible when I read something like it in some book about Platonic Idealism (though I was a teenager at the time so I may have misunderstood it). And, what by analogy would be Nagasena's function and use? Is that a permanent function or use, and/or a good way to understand that Nagasena has a permanent soul, and what the soul is?
