The direct answer (“Yes”) has already been provided, with enough references bh @Lanka’s excellent answer. But I would like to add a perspective: The Dalai Lama (for centuries) has been the political head of the Tibetan state and is not just a spiritual teacher (which too, he of course, is — and a very important one too). The spiritual head of the Gelug sect, to which he belongs, is the head of that Ganden monastery (Ganden Tripa), not the Dalai Lama. This political status makes him special and revered by Tibetans of all sects (even ones that have been in discord with the Gelugpa). The ascension of the Dalai Lama is a rare occasion in history where a monastic was on the throne of a country (a “monk-king”, if you will). It is also natural that rival political forces, rebels, opposing/occupying states would target him in this status. Would it not be logical for a head of state to have bodyguards? So the situation is not quite the same as states providing security for their arhats or foreign countries providing routine security cover for visiting dignitaries. 

Chris’s answer maybe alludes to this, but I want to highlight why the question you are asking is tangential to the teaching of the Buddha. The primary aim of the Buddha’s teaching is not inventions, technological progress, comforts, certain social structures one might consider preferable etc. It is the end of suffering, a goal that, he taught is independent of these things. Second, whether something is natural is not relevant. What is relevant is whether it contributes to an increase or decrease of suffering. Something being natural doesn’t even mean it’s good. All our defilements are natural. In fact, it is taught by the Buddha to view these arisings as mere nature (not to impute “my” onto them). Much of our animal nature points us to acts that would not be considered wholesome by the wise. The Teaching encourages us to understand nature as it is and act wisely in accordance with that understanding, not to act out whatever urge naturally pops up in our mind. Whether to phrase it as animal nature vs. human nature or as the animal nature of humans is a matter of choosing words. This point was beautifully summarized in a little booklet by Lama Yeshe I read years ago. I can’t recall its title now, but there was a small section in it that was titled “Don’t be yourself” and that was the message of the section, that you can do better than that. Please note that nature and evolution optimized us for survival and procreation. They did not endow us with tools to not suffer. The latter is the territory of the Teaching and is the reason why a Buddha had to arise and teach us. In fact, much of our stress is from primal reactions bestowed on us by nature for the two goals it cares about. The Teaching actually doesn’t care to understand origins and evolution and how we got to be endowed with all the urges and reactions we naturally have. Just to understand that they are present, know them exactly as they are and skillfully use this knowledge to relieve the suffering. 

To the instances cited by the other two answers, I shall add one mentioned in the Bojjhanga Sutta (chanted as a protection - paritta very frequently). This one is definitely after enlightenment. 

The answer is mindfulness. To see why, we need to look back to what caused this question to arise in the first place. Surely, the overeating caused some suffering and some wisdom could see that overall, this is a negative thing and needs to stop. But that was not the winning decision at the moment of eating. The desire to eat stepped up powerfully, obscuring the wisdom and was the winner at that moment. The Buddha taught about sensual experiences - (the noble disciple), sees the allure of it (assāda), the drawback (ādīnava) and the escape from it (nissaraṇa)... The reason wisdom did not win the battle at the moment of action is that the drawback was not fully understood (except intellectually). With continuous mindfulness, the causes and effects are seen...again and again. Seeing how, not wanting to fall, one falls into the trap anyway... When the allure, drawback and escape are seen, no techniques or restraint are needed, the desire falls away on its own. This takes many instances, so need not to be harsh on oneself in the meantime. Just keep...observing the arising of the desire, the wisdom fighting that...and then either the wisdom wins in that instance and mindfulness then recognizes the ease that results...or the desire wins and mindfulness recognizes the drawbacks as they take shape... Again and again....only two ingredients required - 

I have often heard that in many places in the suttas where the Buddha says Bhikkave, (monks!), he really means to include the four parisā (assemblies), which includes lay male and lay female devotees. Therefore, it is said, that teaching applies to all. Where did this idea get legitimacy? Is there any mention in the canon itself? I can readily see why one would wish it were so (why would one ignore all the wisdom because it's not spoken directly to oneself) but that doesn't mean it is so. I'm also interested if this explanation is offered in Mahāyāna where the meaning of saṅgha itself is broader, as I understand. Also within Insight/Theravāda circles, is there a difference between the West and traditionally Buddhist countries like Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand in the reading of this word. Any historical insight into whether the West was influenced by the early arrival of Mahāyāna to its shores, for example. Edit: I am aware that it makes sense to view the teachings as applying to everybody. Please note that the question is more specific - is there canonical support (in any canon) for this interpretation? Or some other historical information other than using our own logic. 

I cannot provide my own answer to your question. However, since most answers here are in the No camp, I thought I’d mention a famous proponent of the Yes camp, S.N. Goenka who believed that one can practice the core teachings of the Buddha while continuing to be a practitioner of another religion. I am not sure if his idea of such practice meets your or someone else’s definition of “practicing Buddhism”, though, so please keep that in mind. He has taught hundreds of thousands of people and has hundreds of centers around the world. He grew up in an orthodox Hindu family and considered himself a devout Hindu till his death. Under his view this is not particular to Hinduism and there are people who are Christian and Muslim also who practice his way. As Katinka already pointed out, the Dalai Lama is in the No camp. He thinks Buddhism is suitable for those who are disillusioned with other religions or do not have one - otherwise, just follow “your own religion” whatever that is. Again, this would be dependent on what his view of “practicing Buddhism” is. 

In the vinaya of the Theravāda, it is an offense for a monk to insult or be abusive to another monk (pacittiya 2). But I don’t see any reference to a prohibition from yelling at a lay person (and I know of some instances when some bhikkhus have behaved disgracefully in this regard). For that matter, there seems to be no prohibition in the vinaya on beating the hell out of a lay person either without the use of a weapon (short of killing them). Is that right or am I just missing the rule where this is prohibited? Notes: 

Mettā: Commonly translated as Loving Kindness which is simply because a group at PTS chose that over a century ago and that just stuck. The problem with that is that sometimes people already have associations with the English words “loving” and “kindness”, put them together and think “well, now I know exactly what mettā means.” Some other translations: Amity Kindliness Goodwill Benevolence Friendliness Friendliness can mean different things to different people in English. Here it doesn’t mean niceness but a sincere well-wishing for the other person. Like the goodwill a true friend has. Note that the corresponding Sanskrit word is maitri. Both words are derived from the word for ‘Friend’ which is mitta in Pāli and Mitra in Sanskrit. To be distinguished from Friendship, which is mittatā / mitratā. As to why there isn’t a single word, that’s a common problem in translation between any two languages. Some concepts are prominent in debate and discussion in some cultures, but are not in others. So while translating, one has to find ways to adapt them, often having to use multiple words. Consider zeitgeist and schadenfreude from German, for example. How many words would be needed to express them in English if we hadn’t adopted these words directly. The fact that words like karma and mettā are kept intact in English is a sign that those who tried before us found it hard or impossible to find a single pre-existing good word in English for that idea.
