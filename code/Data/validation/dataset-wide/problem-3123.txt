This is very implausible, as related. Gold has a melting point of about 1065 degrees Celsius, so melting gold while out prospecting would be extremely difficult. Mixing something that hot with ink is just going to ruin the ink. Looking at how inks were made before the modern chemical industry, the usual ways were to mix a very fine powder of pigment (fine soot, or iron sulphate and tannin) with a binder, such as hide glue, or gum arabic. Golden ink, as used in Tibet (thanks for those links) would have been made with very finely powdered gold. Obviously, this prospector would not want to write in visibly golden ink, but mixing very fine gold powder with ordinary black ink would probably work. The difficulty would be creating that fine powder, with particles of about 0.001mm (about 1/20000th of an inch) in size, from a pretty ductile material, under field conditions. The final problem is that the amount of gold you can hide this way is pretty small, but quite heavy. If you used up a bottle of ink, holding a fluid ounce, you could hide maybe 5-6 ounces of gold. So, melting is thoroughly implausible, powdering and mixing with ink is more plausible, but quite unlikely. 

I presume you're asking about his service in the Continental Army of the American Revolution? This would be numerical strength: how many men are fit for service in each platoon, company, battalion and regiment of the brigade. This will change daily during a campaign, usually downwards, as men fall sick, are injured, or desert. Since the Continental Army was not well-organised before the Baron became Inspector-General, all of those things were likely common, and simply requiring officers to report their units' strength regularly will motivate them to manage things better. 

This is historical nonsense. Several physicists realised that an atomic bomb might be possible shortly after the discovery of nuclear fission, notably Leo Szilard, a Hungarian living in the USA. He enlisted Einstein to sign a letter in August 1939 to President Franklin D Roosevelt, warning that Nazi Germany might develop atomic bombs. This letter was effective in starting the Manhattan Project, which developed the engineering and materials production technology needed to build the bomb. However, the scenario described is completely impossible for several reasons: 

Well, you have omitted several countries that Germany conquered, including Belgium, Greece, Luxembourg, Norway and Yugoslavia. For your definition of peace negotiations, it's worth checking those. Hess' intention to negotiate never stood a chance. It's never been quite clear what his offer was, but he seems to have been operating under a fundamental misunderstanding of the British form of government. He imagined that the Duke of Hamilton, whom he'd apparently met briefly at the Berlin Olympics, could get him an audience with the King even if the government was opposed to it. Once he had that audience, he expected that the King would be happy to fire the whole government and install a new one that would side with Germany. This might make sense if you assumed that the British government worked exactly like that of Imperial Germany, including Kaiser Wilhelm II's personality flaws, and that most of the British people wanted to join Germany's side but the government was in thrall to Germany's Jewish-Bolshevik enemies. That conspiracy theory was at the root of Nazism, and tended to wreck committed Nazis' attempts to work with other political systems. Also, his credibility evaporated when his mission was disowned by Hitler. Himmler wanted to negotiate with the Americans and British, and certainly asked people in Sweden to arrange for negotiations. That seems to have been as far as it got, because news of it leaked out, leading to him being fired as a traitor by Hitler. Himmler's negotiating position is known, which was that he and the SS were vital to maintaining order in Germany, and that obviously the Western Allies would be happy to join with Germany in making war on the Soviet Union. Given the Allies' actual attitude to the work of the SS, this was never going anywhere. By the end stages of WWII, it was clear that the West and the USSR were going to have difficult relations afterwards, but Nazi Germany was worse, and they were going to deal with that first. On the "peace negotiations during Dunkirk", the author in question, Stephen Davis seems to work mostly in the field of sensationalised history. Express.co.uk, where the story appeared, is a highly unreliable source. It's above the level of an American supermarket tabloid, but not by much. It concentrates on trying to make the memories of its elderly readership seem important, and in sensationalising anything that might help with the health problems of the elderly. That is its agenda. You can see how this story fits right into the first part. 

The principal reason that Hitler did not use chemical weapons on any large scale on the battlefield was deterrence. By the time he accepted that Germany was losing the war, the Western Allies had air dominance over Germany, and could have attacked German cities with gas. They had the weapons available, were prepared to use them in response to German chemical attacks, and this was known to Hitler and the OKW. By this stage, in late 1944, the Luftwaffe could not effectively resist the bomber fleets, and had no ability to attack Great Britain with gas in response. The V-2 wasn't suitable for gas warheads, simply because it lacked a proximity fuse. Further, the Germans assumed that the Western Allies had discovered the family of organophosphorus nerve agents that includes sarin, tabun, etc. This was actually incorrect, but was perfectly plausible: they'd been discovered by the German chemical industry during insecticide research, and they knew the USA and UK had worked on that. Source: Germany and the Second World War, Volume V/IIB, pp760-772. There had been German military casualties from German use of gas during WWI -- with the technology of the time, a few were unavoidable. 

Destroying those locks is going to be harder than you think. They are very large, at 110 feet x 1,050 feet, and the lock gates have to have been built to stand up to accidental collisions with large ships (at low speed, admittedly). They weigh up to 730 tons, depending on their height. The best way to make the attack seems to be to use anti-ship torpedoes to attack the lock gates, dropping them into the locks, or the canal outside the locks. This needs to be done in a carefully organised way, because if one lane remains operational, the canal is still very useful. Edit: The reason for using torpedoes is that they make it relatively easy to get an explosion in contact with the lock gate, which is hollow and can thus be flooded and made immovable until it is repaired and pumped out. Doing that with dive bombing is chancy: aviators always overstate their accuracy, and dive bombers could often miss ships entirely. The correct gates to attack seem to be the downstream gates at the Pedro Miguel locks. Here, there is only a single lock in each lane, so there's less scope for aircraft attacking the wrong gate. You want to hit the downstream gates because there are two sets of upstream gates in each lane, as a precaution against floods. If the downstream Pedro Miguel gates are destroyed, the canal remains usable, for smaller ships, because of the auxiliary gates half-way along each lock. Since those are normally retracted, attacking them is much more difficult. The Japanese had the ability to refuel at sea, so they could have got some ships into position to make that attack. They probably could not have staged the entire Pearl Harbour task force out there, but nor would it have been necessary. The defences of the Pacific end of the canal don't seem to be all that strong. There is an infantry regiment, a coastal artillery regiment and an additional artillery battery. The Air Corps had a composite wing with 28 medium and 14 light bombers and 24 fighters. The big risk of the mission is getting the attack force back afterwards. It will be thoroughly clear who has made the attack, and an intact US Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbour is in an excellent position to cut off the Japanese force and destroy it. I don't think the Japanese would have given the canal high enough priority to take that risk, given its limited practical effect and that they always concentrated on attacking military forces and neglected attacks on USN logistics throughout the war. Edit: I also don't think they would have thrown away a pair of carriers (you need to send two so that an accident doesn't abort the whole mission) and their escorts and aircrew as the opening shot of a war. They didn't engage in suicide tactics until they were clearly loosing and the situation was desperate. 

The correct term for this is Debasement of the currency. The Wikipedia article on Roman Currency has details. To summarise, the basic coin was the denarius, introduced in 211BC. Its size and the amount of silver in it gradually shrank over time; debasement of the coins was a fairly continuous process. The exact reasons for it aren't clear, but shortages of precious metals, and inadequate state finances probably had a lot to do with it. Debasement usually increased when the empire was weak. 

The haboob did not apparently cause any failures of the helicopters, but it made them disperse to avoid collisions, which slowed everything down, and the timescale was already too tight in various places. Hurrying is a great way to make other things go wrong. 

Other answers have explained why basing the U-boats in the English Channel was a poor idea for the Germans. Here's what actually happened: In spring 1944, most of the U-boats were based in the ports of the Bay of Biscay, where they had easier access to the North Atlantic than they would had they been based in the Channel ports. On June 6th, all seaworthy U-boats in port were ordered to go into the Channel and attack the invasion fleet. This had been anticipated. Every square yard of the area of sea between Cornwall and Britany was being scanned by anti-submarine aircraft with radar every fifteen minutes, day and night. This was a huge effort for the Western Allies, but it worked. Diesel submarines have to surface for air, or snorkel, regularly, and they could be detected by radar when they did so. Their submerged range wasn't adequate to get past the aircraft, especially since they weren't aware of the limits of the patrol area. Very few submarines made it into the invasion area, and few of those accomplished anything. Source: Tarrant, V.E (1994). The Last Year of the Kriegsmarine. Arms and Armour Press. ISBN 1-85409-176-X. Addendum: u-boat.net shows two U-boats lost on 7th June, one of them definitely in the area; three on the 8th, two of them in the area, one on the 10th in the area, one on the 18th south of Guernsey, and one each on the 22nd, 24th, 25th and 30th June. There would not have been a large reserve of U-boats ready to sail, so this is likely a large fraction of the ones that went to oppose the invasion. 

A little research reveals that Nazi party policy on sexuality was somewhat contradictory. This is not surprising, the same thing happened in many fields. Hitler's views were presumably similar to those of the party that followed him. The core of Nazi policy was the idea of "race" and its fundamental importance to everything. An individual's own body was not their own to do with as they wished, but belonged to the German race. Nichole Loroff's article on Gender and Sexuality in Nazi Germany seems reasonably thorough. Like most authoritarian groups, the Nazis espoused social conservatism, and wanted people to stay in very traditional gender roles, with men dominating society. Motherhood was viewed as the most important activity for women, serving the race in an equivalence of the way men served it as soldiers. However, they didn't try to hide and deny sexuality, but to turn it to their ends in increasing the population. So "artistic" female nudity was a major aspect of Nazi art, while unapproved art with sexual elements was automatically pornography and "degenerate art." Unmarried German girls were encouraged to have sex with men, which caused large numbers of pregnancies - seen as a good thing - and spread venereal diseases - covered up, or blamed on the women. Overall, the policy was an incoherent mixture of social traditionalism and satisfying the desires of men at the expense of women. Katherine Burdekin's novel Swastika Night dealt with it rather effectively in 1937.
