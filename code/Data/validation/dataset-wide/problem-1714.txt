I have a client who wants to find a cheap way to get a gigabit link (or so) between two buildings that are within stable wireless range of each other. And he asked me if I knew of a way to do it. I said no. Having said that, one idea did occur to me, and I wanted to see if it was technically feasible. 

Yes. Go into Datacenter > Storage > Add > LVM Group, specify an existing LVM volume group, and you are good to go. New "disks" will be created as logical volumes on the LVM group you've specified. 

When installing LDAP in Ubuntu Server 10.04, you have to do a laundry list of items, that all seem so redundant and time consuming... $URL$ Assuming that I am using Linux (Ubuntu Server 10.04), what is the easiest way to setup an LDAP server (with SSL)? I am thinking about creating a Python script to do all the boring stuff for me, but an existing solution w/ a web gui would be best... EDIT: I want to setup an LDAP server to provide central authentication to a network of Linux workstations. What's the easiest way to do that? 

You may not be able to export an entire VM to another hypervisor, but you can at least export the disk(s): With VirtualBox: First, if the disk is not a "raw" type, then run the following on the KVM hypervisor/server: 

We use Proxmox VE as our virtualization environment, and recently upgraded from 2.X -> 3.X. We also made the change from a single host to a dual host cluster. And, last but not least, we moved our VMs from a LVM backend to a GlusterFS one. Here is a graph from just before the migration. Notice the clean, clear lines: 

I passed the error to the audit2allow utility to create a rule to allow it, but when I try to enable the rule, I get the following error: 

Now on my switch, lets say that I have the port that the aforementioned server connects to, set to VLAN 4... Who wins? What are the packets tagged as, as viewed by the rest of the network? 

System: A physical server/hypervisor (eg. Dell R420) Host CPUs: Number of physical CPU threads available to the "System" (CPUs/cores/hyper threading/etc.) (eg. An Intel Xeon E7-8870 is one processor, 10 cores, and 2 threads per core = 20 "Host CPUs") Guest CPUs: Number of "Host CPUs" usable by a given guest (eg. You might "give" 4 "Host CPUs" to a Windows Server guest running Exchange. The guest machine would think it has a quad-core processor available to it.) (I've made this answer into a community wiki, feel free to improve it.) 

My first thought was that virt1 wasn't responding quickly, so I used to test that theory, and here's the result: 

Bear in mind, FreeIPA is largely Redhat only, and would take a good bit of work to get up-and-running on Debian/Ubuntu/whatever... $URL$ 

The standard way to setup a central "/home" directory on a Linux workstation is using NFS. The problem is that I don't like the lack of real security in NFS. So instead I want to try to use SSHFS. SSHFS in-and-of itself works fine, the problem is with mounting it at boot. If I add a line to "/etc/fstab" for the SSHFS share, the workstation complains that it can't contact the SSH server. This is true because the "/etc/fstab" lines are executed before networking is actually up! Right now I am using the following init script to mount "/home": 

This version sets the file manually inside the state rather than including it as the ID of the state. In doing so, I can solve my problem. 

Why are you not using ntpd? ntpd is much more efficient at making sure your clock is correct than ntpdate is because it buffers the update into smaller changes to avoid any kind of shock to the system. And it definitely does not change your clock to a different month accidentally! I would give more precise instructions on how to install and enable ntpd on your system, but you did not specify your distro. 

P.S. The developers never seem to explain "why" it doesn't work... That just say that it won't. $URL$ Even if "this" problem isn't due to Proxmox, it's generally not going to be worth the effort, because it won't work in the end anyway... 

It doesn't get much simpler than that... Also, I've used this method before, and there is NO time for a user to hit CTRL+C between instances if done right (use the while loop INSIDE , do not create an while loop, or there will be time for CTRL+C). 

I want to leave the root user enabled on my servers for convenience, and the only reason people are against the idea (that I know of) is brute-force attacks on SSH. So, is there is a way in SSH to enable password access for all users except root, but allow ssh-key access for root? OS: Ubuntu Server Edition 10.04 x86 SSH Version: OpenSSH_5.3p1 Debian-3ubuntu7, OpenSSL 0.9.8k 25 Mar 2009 

Would the clients on the unmanaged switch automatically become part of VLAN 3 when trying to communicate the the rest of the network? 

Sorry that I could not be more helpful. Edit: I also placed this here in case a Linux admin is in need of similar info. 

How do I get xinit to allow the use of a "--" within the command given to it? Please note that I thought about moving the sub-command to it's own bash script, but this is for an LTSP server. 

It is company policy for admins to login to the servers via a personal username, and then run to become root. Upon running , sudo will create an environmental variable called , which contains the original user's username. Is there a way to log ALL commands within syslog with something akin to the following syntax: 

Such a tool would make permission troubleshooting much easier, especially with exceptionally long paths like on file servers and such. 

logrotate is unable to rotate a log file for our application on CentOS 7. This appears to be because of this AVC error: 

(Especially note the section, as that's the relevant MAC address.) You also want to edit the interface specific configuration file, e.g., , and remove or update the following line: 

You are looking for the "Alias" function in Apache. The Alias function allows you to "map" users to a sub-directory outside of the document root. You would use it like so: 

We just moved into a new office. The previous tenants went out of business, and left behind anything they couldn't sell off in a hurry. One of the objects left behind was this thing: 

Here is a screen shot of the Webmin SSL config screen as well, for what it's worth: $URL$ Edited Mon Oct 22 10:45:24 CDT 2012: When running the command as Falcon Momot suggested, I get the following error: 

Whenever I create a new user in CentOS 5, their home folder is automatically given the UGO setting of "755", how can I change the default to "700"? Also, the server is technically ClearOS, but it's based on CentOS. 

The only difference is that you have to include a user to run the cron as, as the second argument. I set it to in the example above, but you could set it to for example. 

When using I get A LOT more results than with , why? Note, I checked, and the difference in target IP addresses is not related... Edit: 

Note the existence of the line in the middle of the output. Interestingly it always shows up right after the downloading portion of the apt-get command is completed... Anyone know what could be causing this? 

Lets say I have a forward facing switch, but all the server's NICs are rear facing. What is the proper way to get the CAT cables from the front to the rear of the rack in a way that doesn't open an air-flow hole(s)? A patch panel seems like overkill to me, but let me know if I am wrong... 

I know that the databases, users, tables, etc. are case-sensitive (at least on Linux). But what about the commands themselves? For example, compare: 

I would like to create a trigger in Zabbix to alert me anytime a error appears in a CentOS 6 server's file. I've already tried creating a basic log scrape. E.g.: 

Well, in the end we went with an overcomplicated Python script to do the job until something more viable comes along. Just to give you an idea of how complicated this "script" is, here are the MINIMUM files/folder that must exist for it to work: 

You could technically use Rsync for this: Boot a live CD on the VM, and partition the disk to taste, then mount "/" as /mnt/rootfs/ and run the following from the VM: 

The reason that doesn't work is that the bit is used as the ID for the state, and no two IDs can ever be the same in a SLS file since IDs are global. However, there's an alternative way to write states: 

I want to allows traffic to cross between the servers and ISP without interuption, but I don't want either having access to my LAN. What firewall rules do I apply to allow for this? 

Then fix GRUB, /etc/fstab, etc... Assuming your "OLD-SERVER" has SSH access, this would (mostly) work... I've used this method before to clone physical machines... 

It doesn't run, no errors are present in /var/log/salt-apply.log, and cron does appear to be running the hourly run-parts: 

One of my clients is a small school district in Texas. Like any school, they often have problems with network'd peripherals such as printers, et al. It would be nice to be able to simply "listen" to what the printer and PC are saying to each other (or not saying more importantly)... The problem is that I can't find old-style "hubs" anymore, and even if I could, it's not a long-term solution. All of the devices that I have found to replicate the purpose of a simple hub are either $100+ or are difficult to throw into a networking tool kit (aka my backpack)... Now that hubs are dead, what's the new low-cost standard for simple packet capture in the networking world? 

To fix this, you are going to want to edit two files: First of all, you are going to want to remove the NIC from udev. Edit , and remove all lines similar to the following: 

Notice how the command given to xinit uses "--" in-and-of-itself (before the IP)? Well, xinit complains about it: 

After working on this all night, I found a solutions that works. Here's a solutions that DOESN'T WORK: 

There are several Linux technologies that can provide a similar effect. The following are the big two: 

And yes, the script runs fine if you just execute it at a shell prompt. Any help would the greatly appreciated. Thanks! 

Absolutely nothing of interest... Now, originally I thought this was just a fact of the location's network set up. (I assume they block pings or something...) However, watch what happens when I use to run a traceroute... 

Ok, I swear I know how to do this! However, it appears to have slipped my mind, and it's starting to frustrate me that I can't remember... ;) If I install CentOS 6 without the Anaconda installer it will install a "minimal" install by default. However, the minimal install is missing basic utilities such as wget, and I would like to install the "basic server" profile onto it after-the-fact. So, to summarize: How do I Install the "Basic Server" Profile onto a "Minimal" Install of CentOS? 

Now, what's odd is that about 75% of the time, it will fail to boot and displays the errors above, and the other 25% it boots fine. The reboot always happens following the GRUB menu, but before Debian begins posting the typical syslog/boot messages. As always, any help would be greatly appreciated, thank you! 

There are tools such as Clonezilla and FOG that are for cloning dozens of machines at a time. It works both locally (Clonezilla on a CD/DVD), and network (PXE boot FOG)... Clonezilla - $URL$ FOG Project - $URL$ Leave a comment if you need help setting one up... EDIT: I SERIOUSLY do not recommend using a live CD... It requires a lot of background work to get everything working, the tools listed in this post will create a bit-for-bit identical copy of your current setup on all workstation you deploy to... A much easier solution over-all. 

When attempting to visit the Status > RRD Graphs page of pfSense, I am greeted with a blank page... Most likely due to PHP being unable to complete the request... I am unsure how to repair this. On Linux I would usually run something akin to the following to discover the problem, but I can't do this on pfSense (AFAIK): 

A client of mine decided to go ahead and move from a self-signed certificate to a commercial one ("GoDaddy Standard SSL"). The first service I wanted to move to the commercial SSL cert was Webmin/Usermin... However, upon migrating to the new SSL cert and restarting Webmin, I got the following error: 

I accidentally installed Postfix from APT onto our Zimbra email server virtual machine (KVM/Proxmox VE 2.1). I purged it instantly, however, it did not help. The following are the steps I took in a desperate attempt to fix it: 

Does anyone know of a way to do the following on Linux. I can't seem to find a way to run a script after the user is authenticated, but before the session starts... 

When selecting a RAID card for a project, how can I ensure that it is well supported under Linux (Debian 6)? 

What I want to do is create a regular expression that can parse text like this looking for two or more words on the same line. For example, if I was looking for a SELinux boolean that covered "ftp" AND "home" on the same line, I would currently do the following: 

I have a few computers on my network that boot via iSCSI (due to dead HDDs) using chainloaded iPXE over DHCP. I wanted to enable CHAP for my iSCSI target to increase security (and learn). However, iPXE does not appear to support CHAP... Is it possible to boot from iSCSI and use CHAP at the same time? 

Is there a tool in Linux that will take a path such as , and print the permission for each branch of the path, i.e.: 

There is a point in the build process that the container you are "building" takes over, and starts running commands itself. It is at this point that you are getting the error you see. The error is due to the client populating it's own apt source list using the mirror you gave it (file://root/ISO/ubuntu-12.04.1-desktop-i386.iso in this case). However, when the client tries to do an , it can't, because relative to the client's there is no . To avoid this, simply tell it to copy the apt source list from the server verbatim instead. The argument you want is . The full command would be (working off what you listed above): 

While installing Untangle 9 I accidently installed the "premium" package and the "lite" package. I only wanted the "lite" package, and was wondering if anyone knew of a way to remove a package group from an Untangle router? 

I'm not sure what you mean when you say "circumvented", but if you mean that users could hit "cancel" and end up dropping back to a terminal, then nothing stops you from placing in a while loop... Here is an example: 

Does anyone know where I can find the specs for what each wire inside CAT 6 does? Specifically, which are for sending, and which are for receiving? Both 100mbit and 1Gbit specs would be useful, thank you in advance... 

However, it does not work. I believe this is due to the and it's parent folder using the following permissions: 

Long story short, we have a small thin client infrastructure setup using Windows 7 and XP for educational use (not Server 2008/2003). My question is if anyone knows of a way to set the Windows theme to "Classic" for all users (for XP & 7)? This could be a logon script, or a registry edit, anything really... 

One option would be to go to a website like this: $URL$ Load this website both pre-sshuttle and post-sshuttle and compare the two. See if it changes, if it does, then that means everything is working. Edit: Wow,I can't believe I completely missed the second line...? In that case, it's probably not working, are you running the command as root? Also, try it without "--dns". 

Keep in mind that you will lose all date/time information. The only way around that is by adding an "X-Zimbra-Received" header to each message containing a copy of the "Date:" header. Use your imagination for how to do this, Perl comes to mind...
