Linen! It’s less about availability, both would be available to Nabataean traders. Linen use in India actually predates cotton. 

Early in the war it might have been a reference to Jefferson Davis being in League with the Devil, being a demon etc... for fomenting rebellion and the catastrophe of the Civil War, from the Northern perspective. This was a common motif. It could also be a reference to Jefferson Davis's Democratic roots. The donkey sometimes looked like a bat in political comics especially when portraying villians. 

So that would be my answer.. while the Postal Service has never actually entirely gotten away from horse / mule delivery (see be low); by 1920, after WWI they had mostly transferred primary delivery to automobiles and motorcycles. Prior to that 1905-1915 they were relying on postal workers to purchase cars for their own use. By 1920 the postal service was sold on the utility and the technology had become reliable enough that they were investing in their own fleet of automobiles. ..................................................................... Some of the USPS mail is still delivered by horseback. In the year 2000 CBS news did a story on a USPS subcontractor named Charlie Chamberlain, who along with a dozen others delivers mail daily to an indian village at he bottom of the grand canyon. 

Yes, The Klan was a political force in this country, and not just in the South, and not just in the early 1900's. It was powerful nationally around the time of the Great Depression and it remained powerful in parts of the country right up to Martin Luther King's civil rights movement of the 1960's. The klan had a major resurrection in the United States after the release of DW Griffins(1915)wildly popular birth of a Nation and not just in the south. The most popular period of the klan was known as the second klan(1914-1944). and that fully covers the period of the film “Brother Where Art Thou”. During this period klan membership peaked 1924-1925 at 6 million people. 

Both American and British used similar tactics to protect and discover sensitive information during the war. The United States however proved better at it which gave them a and perhaps the decisive edge in the war. George Washington while an officer in the British Army during the 7 years war ( French and Indian War ); had learned how important obtaining sensitive information and protecting your own information was. Early on in the Revolutionary War, Washington was very interested in recruiting spies and learning everything he could about his British opponents. He created very sophisticated networks of specialists to run and control rings of spies he employed in occupied British held territory all geared to preserving secrecy. Among the tactics employed in the American Revolutionary War: 

The sun god appeared on the flip side of Constantine's coins. The worship of Mithraism became synonymous with fidelity to the emperor. 

No Gobachev didn't get such a commitment because Gobachev didn't foresee the whole sale evaporation of the Soviet Union, nor did anybody in the West in 1989. Thus no such commitment would be necessary. Gorbachev didn't decide to dissolve the Soviet Union December 25, 1991. The Soviet Union un-expectantly collapsed from its own fiscal weight when it could no longer afford to operate. Gorbachov himself left the Kremlin when officials (Boris Yeltsin) literally turned the lights off in the Kremlin. The end was that surreal. From a vision stand point Gorbachov made a few mistakes leading up to having his office lights turned off on him. Mistakes which he could have mitigated had he understood what was happening. (1) Yetsin had been democratically elected and thus seemed to possess more credibility with the people than did Gorbachov who was appointed by the Soviet infrastructure. If Gorbachov had stood for elections earlier when he was popular enough to have won; he may have been able to win a popular stand off with Yeltsin. (2) Gorbachov survived (both physically and politically) a coup attempt in August of 1991 where leaders of the former Soviet Union tried to retire him as had once been done to Nikita Khrushchev. Gorbachov did not survive due to his own political acumen but rather his primary rival Yeltsin proved too popular with the people, including rank and file soviet troops who ended up turning away from soviet commanders in favor of Yeltsin's authority. Here again Gorbachev was entirely unprepared for the betrayal, and was saved as an side effect by Yeltsin’s bold confrontation of soviet troops sent to arrest him. But Gorbachov never saw the big picture of what was happening to the Soviet Union. Nobody did. Everybody saw the bleeding, nobody realized the collapse was imminent. Nobody in the west saw it, not even famously multi billion dollar intelligence agencies who had studied little else for six decades. Suggesting Gorbachov foresaw any of this in a timely manor and was able to illicit terms from the west is absurd. Everybody thought the Soviet Union was just tightening the belt, adjusting policy, nobody realized the super power, vaunted NATO boogie man, was about to succumb to systemic organ failure from decades of neglect. Now the Wall in Germany came down a 9 November 1989. Its possible at that time if Gorbachov understood what was happening, perhaps he had leverage to negotiate such an arrangement with NATO member states. That would have occurred with individual member nations and would mean 16 separate agreements which is the only way such an pact would be creditable. Membership in NATO must be unanimous so one nay vote is technically enough to block a new member, but to block all of Eastern Europe when many in the west believes Stalin stole anyway would take a huge block to keep out. To further dismiss this proposition Gorbachov's own admission he agreed that a unified Germany would go into NATO; and no other former WARSAW pact nation was in play Nov 1989. Gorbachev didn’t know just two years latter the power would be turned off to his office. Gorbachev didn’t even realize that the morning of the event, nobody did. It's not likely Gorbachev saw the Soviet retreat from all of Eastern Europe, or Eastern Europes mass defection to the West. The rest of the WARSAW Pact countries didn't follow an orderly line out of the Soviet Union. As the Soviet Union contracted, the Soviet friendly governments were replaced by more independent minded governments and the entire exercise was out of Gorbachev's or frankly NATO's control. I think Gorbachov's book is basically one meant for domestic consumption. Michael Gorbachov goes down in history in the West as a great leader who rode his sinking ship down the tubes in an orderly manner. He certainly wasn't the architect, but he would be the captain of that collapse. To his great credit he didn't allow the instability he inherited to motivate him to pursue a messy military solution. I think domestically in Russia, however; history does not treat him as kindly and that is why he would suggest he was somehow betrayed by the West. I think in Russia domestically they actually think what was called for then was another Stalin like leader. A strong man willing to massacre millions of citizens to keep the empire together. Of coarse most Russian nationalists look back fondly on Stalin and don't delve too closely with the whole second or third largest mass murder of the 20th century history. This phantom talk of an agreement in keeping former Warsaw Pact nations out of NATO is thus an excuse for domestic consumption to excuse what the Russian populous believes was Gorbachev's personal failure. Suggesting Gorbachev had the foresight to seek terms, was honorably given terms, but he was betrayed by the west; dismisses the entire relationship between the Soviet Union and the West. The entire thread of events relies on 20/20 hind sight, because actual events occurred so quickly and where so shockingly unforeseen nobody in Russia or the West were aware the end was near until Gorbachev was literally sitting in the dark.

I found this article. No surviving original manuscripts. The oldest words of Josephus come from quotations incorporated into others writings from the the 4th century(Eusiphus). For complete manuscripts we have a latin translations from the fifth century. 

Around the time the period of the second Klan came to an end the popular Radio show Superman did a 16 episode arch on Superman fighting the Klan in 1947. A man named Stetson who was associated with the Stetson hat company(descendant).. infiltrated the Klan, learned their secrets and with Superman's(the radio program's) help, spread those secrets nationally. I've read several sources(freakanomics) which credit Superman for ending the second Klan, or at least averting the same kind of resurgence the klan had at the end of WWI, in WWII. 

An omnipotent king having a group of elected advisors is not a display of democracy. It's a display of a competent monarch. There were no examples of Democracy in India before the British, Not even displays of Republicism which would be far more likely. I would argue however the success and adoption of Democracy in India has more to do with the people of India and their leaders, than it does with the British who introduced the practice. The former British Empire is full of states which were not nearly as successful as India in pursuing Democracy. Pakistan(*), Kenya, Malaysia, and Sri Lanka(**) come to mind.. (*) Pakistan might consider itself a democracy, but they've had long periods of military rule which India has avoided. (**)Sri Lanka is nominally a democratic state but, in reality, has become an ethnocracy, privileging the majority community. 

** 1940 Election Map Roosevelt lost 10 states** Long before FDR announced global events had proven the United States would require strong leadership to chart the waters before her, and FDR was widely perceived as the nations strongest, most experienced option. 

Good question. Modern doctrine would say AirPower is paramount for massed armor offensive as the Germans used against France in 1940. Today we know Armor mobilized is armor exposed and susceptible to attack by air. The reason why German air wasn’t given the primary credit at the time was because every aspect of the tactics the Germans were using was so novel and impressive, the allies didn’t know the counter. Nobody had used massed armor like that before, nobody had used coordinated air in support of ground units with such effect before. And of coarse nobody knew that massed armor could be smashed by AirPower as the allies would demonstrate to Rommel in North Africa. In France the British and French air didn’t have the training or understanding to attempt to counter the Germans which diminishes the credit and importance of the luftwaffe role. The Germans so outclassed the allies in tactics, training, and general showing it was easy to credit the entire performance and not isolate to specific components of the offensive such as air. So dominant was the German performance in the battle of France it was easy to overlook the role of the luftwaffe. General Von Rundstedt who was in the battle of France in command of battle group A would demonstrate this several years later in preparation for the defense of France. Von Rundstedt would argue to reserve the best German units away from the beaches for a counter attack to an allies invasion of d day. Thinking he could recreate the successes of blitzkrieg after the allies landed even though the luftwaffe no longer controlled the air. Rommel with his experience in North Africa would argue without air superiority units not at the beaches would be destroyed before they could be brought into effect. Von Rundstedt a German field marshal four years after the battle of France still failed to grasp the importance of air superiority. 

It is a valid representation of history. However, it's so short and lacks so much detail that it can only claim to be part of the complete picture. A piece of the puzzle which doesn't attempt to address the Libyan role, the complexity of the American role, the history of Libya with the west, tactics used, tactics not used, west's motivation, the NATO Role, the origins of the uprising inside of Libya, and aftermath. A more complete picture would address a lot more details: 

Working Class People, including his assembly line workers. The cost of the car had dropped from $850 - $340 from 1908 - 1920's. 1920's Ford introduced easily obtainable financing with an installment payment plans. In 1914, Henry Ford announced that it would pay workers a minimum wage of $5 a day. This was more than double the average for the automobile industry. He simultaneously reduced the working day from nine hours to eight, operating the factory 24-hours-a-day with a three-shift system. His factory in 1914 employed 13,000 workers. In 1920 the male workforce ages 10 and over gainfully employed was 78 million. See U.S. Census page #60. Between 1913 and 1927, Ford factories produced more than 15 million Model Ts. By 1927 the company was turning out a Model T every 24 seconds. The term of 'Fordism' emerged as "a manufacturing system designed to spew out standardized, low-cost goods and afford its workers decent enough wages to buy them". My research showed you can still find Model-T's in near original shape for sale for around $10k on the low end. highly modified roadsters are considerable more. sources: history.com. US Census 1928.

I wanted to include the pictures of both gestures and add to the given answer. The gesture was explained to Churchill many times according to his private secretary and Churchill continued to use both the victory sign and the vulgar sign interchangeable with palm facing both ways before he eventually did confine himself to the victory sign (palm facing outwards). As for why once informed he continued to use the vulgar gesture, maybe he was not entirely put off the public surmising he was giving Hitler a private vulgar message with the gesture, or perhaps he just had bigger things on his mind at that point early in the war.
