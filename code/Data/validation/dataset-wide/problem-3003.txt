It seems that Socrates did not have a formalized knowledge theory. He contributed to perfecting the philosophical dialogue in the sense that you can only find some answer if you are doing the correct question. So most part of the search for an answer comes from stating what you mean with what you are saying in your question and then refining your question. "Is love a good thing?", what do you mean with love? Is there more than one kind of love? Do you mean that love is a virtue? What is a virtue? Through reasoning you may reach the definition of the concepts present in the question, so that you will get your answer, the correctedness of the answer depends on this work of what is the question about and what you mean when you say such words, after which you can reach a logical conclusion to the problem. Plato, influenced by Socrates, gives great importance to dialectics as the instrument for knowledge in his development of a formalized knowledge theory. Although Socrates had a method of inquiry he lacked an ontology and as such, truth would rely solely on the logic conclusion of correct argumentation; he differs from sophists who rely on argumentation but claim that there's no truth, that it is all a matter of perspective. So even if Socrates thought that there was no way of being completely certain about finding an ultimate truth, he certainly was not relativistic like the sophists. If you say Socrates' epistemology was diminished (and I'm not certain about why you say that) I think it is only a matter of incompleteness in his theory, but his thoughts were very important to development of Plato's theories. 

It seems that Heidegger, in his later texts, turns to poetical writing as the most adequate form of language to "unveil the world", in this way, poetic language would fulfill his work that started in a philosophical ground. I'm not sure whether he considers this as a merging of philosophy and poetry, but I think this is a good reference for the subject. Here an article about this $URL$ 

Rhetoric has three modes of persuasion: logos, ethos and pathos. These modes may appear alone, but usually they are combined. The subject of the speech will define which modes are adequate. If someone is talking about mathematics, probably it will be based on logos alone, but when someone is talking about subjective issues, there's no way it can be done with logos mode only. Any sort of religious argumentation could not rely solely on logic. Beginning with assuming that God exists and accepting this would be an act of faith despite proof, any other argumentation with this assumption is already beyond logic. As I see it, these three elements are present in that passage. Sometimes people regard "rhetorical" as being something bad, meaning that is is not logical. But the use of logos mode is a type of rhetoric as well. Either way, the use of different speech elements to reinforce the communication of a message is something we cannot do without in many cases. 

Some philosophers seem to be doing a kind of "applied philosophy", some sort of service similar to psychoanalytic work... i'm not sure how it goes, but it does exist. It is known as philosophical clinic, as far as I'm concerned $URL$ This reminds me of the movie "I heart Huckabees", in which there are "existential detectives", who perform investigations to solve people's crisis. 

For "why reproduction happens", and all the types of reproduction, you should take a look at evolutionist theory (specially, the differences between sexual and assexual reproduction may be of interest). Now... as of humans, it is an interesting question, as there's nothing "natural" in the way humans deal with sexuality. A classic on this is Freud's "Three essays on sexuality", where he delves in the question of what is normal and what is a deviation in human sex life. If sex aims at reproduction, every activity that doesn't fulfill this (masturbation, homossexuality, and even kissing) should be considered a deviation, so he ends up with the idea that there's no normality in human sexuality. In the end, he concludes that, for humans, sex as reproduction needs to be a cultural (moral) value. 

One intepretation for the Allegory of the Cave is that a person would get released through διαλεκτική (dialetic), this is what would allow the person to free from the chains imobilizing him/her inside the cave and also it would enable escalating the way out of it. The prisioner who manages to escape is the philosopher, the light he sees is the Goodness that illuminates the inteligible, in the same way that the sun illuminates the sensible (notice that Plato makes an analogy between vision and knowledge: Sun-Goodness, Light-Truth, Eyes-Intelligence, Vision-Intuition). Returning to the cave and getting people out of there is the use of philosophical dialogue. Knowledge is the way to freedom, illumination. The philosophical παιδεία (paideia) would turn the soul from the sensible to the intelligible - "looking in the right direction" - the light outside the cave instead of the shadows projected into the wall"; abandoning images and opinion (eikasia and doxa) of the sensible through reason (dianoia) to reach intelectual intuition (noesis). That said, it seems that the only part of this knowledge which could be beyond words is the noesis, but it is only reached through dianoia and dialetics. After this is reached, going back to the cave would need language as well - the philosophical dialogue. Possibly the confusion you state in your question concerns the fact that the prisioner who escapes is alone in the allegory - I think this indicates that the knowledge obtained frees only the person who obtained it, each person has to go through the process to reach enlightment. From a practical perspective this can be understood in two ways: the person is doing philosophical dialogue through dialetics in debate with another person or in debate with one's owns ideas, "dialoguing" with oneself. The dialectical movement requires debate and confrontation of opposite ideas, this can be understood as the realm of language yet. 

Pascal wager is an attempt to merge ethics with logic, in the sense that given there's a doubt concerning the afterlife, it would be more rational to live according to the belief that there is one, after weighting possible earns vs. losses. It was an attempt to turn a subjective choice into an objective one so that ethics would come down to logic. Whenever there's an argumentation, two outcomes are possible (alone or combined): convincement and persuasion. The first one appeals to reason/logic only: I may show you some data and convince you that smoking is bad for you. You are convinced, you agree with me that this data makes sense, but if you are not persuaded you won't stop smoking. What would it take to make a person be persuaded? It usually would come to using the ethos and pathos modes of argumentation. If I show you the picture of your best friend suffering from lung cancer caused by smoking, perhaps you would be persuaded. Sometimes persuasion alone is enough to change someone's mind. Convincement or the logos mode usually is not enough. The question is, could one persuade oneself to change a course of action or patterns of though? I believe it is possible, but, as stated before, it would require means beyond pure logic. 

As pointed out by @MichaelDorfman, the definition of "necessary" is "that it could not possibly exist otherwise". A good example on this that might help you out is the relation between color and extension. You cannot have color without extension, as such, there's a relation of necessity between them. (But, as pointed by @JosephWeissman, you could have extension without color). A similar and popular example is "All bodies are extense (take up space)", as you cannot have a body without extension, extension is necessary for the conception of a body. As the predicate is a necessary condition for the concept of the subject, this statement is what Kant calls an analytic proposition. A proposition like this indicates what is the concept about. Consider "A square has four equal sides". It is necessary for some object to be called "square" to have "four equal sides and four equal angles". If you say "this square is big/small/red/black", these are not necessary conditions, only possible ones, they do not affect the concept of a square. This is pretty much like what is called "accidental" in philosophy - the accidental characters (color/size) do not change the fact that it is a square. This is why Kant considers necessity an "a priori" knowledge, it is beyond sensorial experience, otherwise you could not call so many different objects a "square". 

As I see it, the most important point in this matter is that our society is ruled by conceptions of normality and these conceptions always leave someone out of it. As such, what is defined as 'marginal' is a consequence of what is considered 'normal'. The thing is, usually, the marginal, abnormal, is something that people want to exclude, suppress, make it disappear; Foucault is pointing to the fact that this "stranger" will never disappear, for when there's a law, there's someone out of it. Considerations toward "normality" as being a measure of what is "good" can be considered a rhetorical figure: "good" is defined by what applies to the largest number of cases, that which is longlasting (this is a 'classical place'); the opposite of this would be "good" is what is rare, ephemeral ('romantic place'). Practical applications of this would be related to considering "abnormalities" as consequences of "normality" as defined by a culture/speeches. Is a person considered crazy because s/he doesn't fit, or s/he doesn't fit because s/he is considered crazy? Isolating people only worsens the problem; from a psychiatric perspective, socialization is the "cure" for most "illnesses"... but if someone is labeled as inapt, dangerous, etc, chances are people will avoid socializing with him/her. So, according to this, internship should be done only in extreme and unavoidable cases (it would be necessary to define what would be such a case, though). Psychiatric reform is based on this conception. Rather than considering the 'mentally ill' and other marginalized people as a source of social problems, this issues (illness and marginality) should, actually, be considered as consequences of social practices. 

Suspicion is oriented toward questioning beliefs and, as such, is closely related to criticism. It points to uncertainty, in a way this may be considered a kind of knowledge, but it is a sort of "negative" knowledge without positive answers. Maybe some critic work may end up breeding new propositions, but it is not immune to suffering what it has done to others. Paul Ricoeur considered that Marx, Nietzsche and Freud could be grouped in what he called "hermeneutics of suspicion". You may find an article on this subject here: $URL$ 

As I see it, the definition of miracle would be something like "the impossible made possible", that is, a miracle points to a contradiction. E.g. - it is impossible to walk on water, for that to happen, it would have to be a miracle. So, a miracle denies an impossibility. The concept of miracle is illogical, and only happens because language allows the construction of statements even though there's no logic to it. I recall here Chomsky famous construction "colorless green ideas sleep furiously", if something is colorless, it cannot be green. The phrase is grammatical, but not logical. What could a rational person accept is another problem. If rational is all that this person is, and rationality excludes contradiction, then a rational person could not accept the existence of a miracle. Maybe human beings make use of reason but cannot be defined as purely rational beings. 

Maybe it could be considered a fallacy of misplaced concreteness (reification), that is, treating an abstract belief or hypothetical construct as if it were a real, concrete event or physical entity. $URL$ 

Are reality and existence interchangeable? Did Aristotle have a conception of reality different from existence, or is the use of reality somehow anachronic in these passages? As I understand it, the particular would have a material cause, and in the sense pointed above, "God" would exist but not be real. I know that this author has marxist influence and I thought that perhaps there is an overlapping of the concepts of reality and materiality. One thing that came to my mind is that real could actually be meaning natural, but I don't have a clear definition of what would natural mean to Aristotle (possibly something like material existence). 

A plane is defined by being 2-dimensional. But if it is curved (like a hyperbolic plane), it requires an extra dimension, that is, it is curved in a 3-dimensional space. So it seems, 2-D coordinates wouldn't be enough to describe this plane. What is it's dimension? Should it be considered as 2 < D < 3 (some sort of fractal dimension)? $URL$ I'm not sure whether this question is suitable for Philosophy... please comment. 

I'm reading a book on the history of philosophy and the author makes use of the word real-reality-really in such a way that is a bit confusing for me. For example: 

Reasoning/judging rely on language rather than on physical existence of objects (something you can see/touch/smell etc). That is why you can talk about ghosts, elves or even microbes that maybe you have never seen. Same thing about simple expressions as "hi" and "bye". All of theses expressions are elements in your communication system, signifiers that correspond to concepts and have different values. Actually this linguistic organization is determinant of the delimitation of objects of thought, so that in some culture there may be no difference between green and blue and both are considered the same color. I guess there's a problem with the lack of definition of existence in your question. 

Philosophy may breed other knowledge fields and these restrict fields may come to a point in which they are completely explored. But philosophy is much more than that. Basic philosophical questions like: what is knowledge? What does it mean to say "I know" something? If someone said "Everything that is there to be known is already known", one could ask "How can you know that? If there is something we don't know, how can we know it?". And so on... Maybe this is what philosophy is about: not coming to an end. 

People almost always have "rational explanations" for the things they do. Two important, related points: 1) the reasoning may be flawed and the person is not able to perceive it 2) many things cannot be decided on purely rational means (e.g. they involve moral and emotional issues as well) Usually, the person is not aware of these other factors and may be convinced that s/he cannot be wrong. I guess the nazis were pretty convinced that they were completely rational in performing the holocaust. The thing is, many of our thoughts and actions involve subjective issues. The idea of being able to make pure rational choices leave us blind to the irrational in us. Considering ourselves to be flawless is a recipe for disaster. 

I believe a parallel and more interesting problem would be that of persons who suffer paralysis of almost all their muscles, in what is called "locked-in syndrome". When something like this happens, the big question is how to verify that the person is conscious? how do you know he/she understands what you are saying to him/her? in this case, consciousness will be verified through the stablishment of a common code, using whatever muscle the damaged person still is able to control (like blinking the eye). Watch "The diving bell and the butterfly" for a real story on this. If this communication is not stablished, it is rather impossible to say whether the person is conscious or not. In the case of chemical signs some trees give away, as well as magnetic fields stuff, this cannot be considered communication as consciousness, as they are purely physical/chemical reactions. The tree hasn't got a choice, this reactions will happen necessarily, whenever certain changes take place, there's no manipulation of a communication code. It's closest to Newton's laws.
