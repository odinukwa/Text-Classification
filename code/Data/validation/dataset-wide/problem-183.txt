Where Do You Poop? Assuming there are a multitude of species visiting this place, where do they all go to the bathroom? What do you do with the sewage after its uhhh... deposited. I mean for all you know some species defecation process produces sulfuric acid while a silicon based life form is dropping off 30 pounds of sand. Sanitation becomes a nightmare when you have to accommodate dozens of different body morphology's and biological physiology types. Basically half your facility has to be row after row of different bathrooms and processing plants to accommodate the various differing methods to safely and cleanly process all of this waste. I mean maybe some of the 98 species can use the same facilities, but not all of them....... 

So the idea is for chemical weapons to come back into use because they are marketed/propagandized as humane. I got the idea from a documentary on how easy it is to overdose on Fentanyl. Basically the weapons would be dispersing some kind of powdered synthetic opiate. The idea is that these bombs are lauded as a way to "just put the bad guys to sleep" and come to be seen as a humane way to cause death without suffering. As a result the use of chemical weapons comes back into vogue on the battlefield by first world powers. Is there a synthetic Opiate more potent than Fentanyl? 

Orbit is a function of velocity as well as altitude The Reason balloon/rocket orbital launches aren't made is because no matter how high you get your rocket, you still have to get it moving with enough velocity along the proper vector to circularize an orbit. To be sure, balloons with sounding rockets attached are a great way to break out of the atmosphere, but they are a terrible way to achieve an orbit. Achieving a high enough altitude to leave the atmosphere is actually quite easy, but if the proper velocity is not gained in doing so then the object will simply begin plunging back to earth in a ballistic trajectory. About 9.4 km/s delta-v is the minimum required to establish a stable orbit. This means that even if you float it up there on a balloon your rocket isn't really going to end up any smaller or cheaper than a regular ground launched one, its going to have to burn nearly the same amount of fuel (not enough less to offset the cost of your gargantuan balloon) except now its for the purpose of gaining velocity instead of altitude. So, to answer your question, unless you achieve enough velocity to establish an orbit a rocket launched from a balloon will look like this: If you DO have enough velocity to establish an orbit it will look the same as a regular rocket launch, it will just have a higher altitude for its starting point. 

Nuclear Strategy Is not what Hollywood Depicts it as In movies you always see these big dramatic shots of missile swarms targeting centers of population. To be sure, that is ONE tactic that can be employed for nuclear bombardment, but its not actually the most likely one. It just shows how we as people vastly overestimate our value to our rulers. We as a populace actually aren't very valuable as strategic targets. I'll explain briefly some nuclear strategic options and deployment then it will make sense why there was "no military presence." So lets say you have a big land war between two nations, things are going bad for one so they use a nuclear weapon to wipe out a carrier group or a massive tank division or something. Hollywood now has all the silo doors opening and going berserk in a radioactive orgy of cinematic destruction that would make Michael bay weep tears of awestruck wonderment and joy. Not so. The leader of the nation that was just nuked has several options and you can be guaranteed that he will consider them very carefully. Tit for Tat- Deploy a singe device the same size as the one the enemy used against a military target of equal value to demonstrate that you are not deterred but also aren't looking for an escalation. The hope is to get them scared and bring them to the bargaining table. Up the Ante- You deploy two devices against military targets of very high value. The idea is that you are telling them you are willing to go all the way on this and hope they get scared and come to the bargaining table. Hard Strike- You assess that the enemy is willing to go all the way and that anything less than a full preemptive strike against hard military targets will result in your destruction. You target military bases, nuclear launch sites, and centers of government to attempt to destroy the enemy capability to fire more nukes at you. The idea is that you shoot first and destroy all of their military capabilities before they can get their missiles off the ground. Hopefully afterwards they will be willing to surrender or come to the bargaining table. Soft strike You target cities simply for the pure meanness of it hoping to break their will and ability to support their military and government. This is the typical Hollywood style all out nuclear holocaust you will see in theaters. Its really just a nuclear version of the WW2 terror bombing raid campaigns used by all sides in that conflict. The idea is that industry will be destroyed and the will of the people will be broken. It persisted after WW2 for long enough that it has become the most well known strategy, even though it is outdated and actually the last option on the table out of many many others. As both the Axis and Allies found in WW2, terror bombing doesn't really work. Pearl harbor, and the firestorms in Tokyo and Dresden only seemed to harden the resolve of the respective targets. Whats worse, by using such tactics you open the door to having them used on yourself. So to answer your question, The nuclear war was one which used the hard strike option. The primary targets were military installations, troop formations, naval fleets, air bases, missile launch sites, and centers of government. That's not to say the populace didn't suffer, they did greatly, but they were merely the collateral damage, not the primary targets. The military is already less than 1% of the populace, very very few units survived, and without effective leadership the few survivors simply deserted. There was no effective government left, people were starving, dying from preventable diseases, no clean water, no food, people were dying from rad sickness and no help came. The secondary effects of a nuclear caused social collapse would actually kill as many or more people than the bombs themselves, and no help came! The military and government became objects of bitter resentment and loathing to the hard-bitten survivors. "where was the military? where were out leaders?" Can quickly turn into "there was no military, there were no leaders." This becomes accepted legend over a few years and by the time the 2nd and 3rd generation of offspring are raised military and government have become a mythological bogey man who promised to protect the people then betrayed them and left them to the wolves. 

Climate Will be Whatever Its Builder's Want Any structure as massive as a true Dyson sphere speaks of a civilization that can harness literally astronomical levels of resources and energy and put it to task. Any species that achieves this level of technology will by nature of being so advanced and possessing so much control over so much mass and energy that it would be fairly safe to assume the climate on such a construct will be whatever its builders wish it to be. It would not make sense to build something you plan to live on that you cannot control after all. I Don't Think Anyone Has Seriously Modeled Such Constructs That being said, where we are technologically in relation to Dyson spheres is about where Davinci was when he was drawing clockwork wing-suits in comparison to our modern day supersonic flight. Worse off actually, Davinci didn't need to prove that flight itself was possible, anyone looking at a bird knew it was. We on the other hand, can only theorize along lines of physical laws of nature and mathematics to say it is theoretically possible. We as of yet cannot look into the cosmos and see a Dyson sphere and go "well, its possible, now we just have to figure out how....." When we speak about Dyson spheres we are speaking so far in advance of where we are now that I don't think anybody has ever seriously tried to apply accurate climate models to the living surface of such a construct. If they have then its very obscure because I have never seen nor heard of such a project, and I spend a LOT of time reading about this stuff. Likely somebody has at least tried but their work was probably not taken very seriously or given much attention. They would be talking about an idea that is so theoretical and far outside of our reach at the moment that its probably just not seen as very useful. I personally refer to such work as "Trying to invent a better light-bulb before you've discovered electricity." Obviously very interesting and possibly will be looked back some day as the first tentative steps in the right direction, but not of very much serious concern in its own time. In summary, to my knowledge nobody has applied any serious effor towards modelling the climate of a Dyson sphere. Maybe somebody in further answers here will have found such work and render my answer moot, because I find the idea very very interesting but have never seen nor can I find anything like it. 

You could shine a very very powerful laser at a distant planet. Maybe it does take quite a long time to get there, but once its there if you were to shine the laser back and forth across the distant planet the change in the lasers position would appear to be happening in real time giving the illusion of faster than light action. Maybe im totally bass-ackwards on my physics because im not sure if the illusion counts in both points of reference on either end of the laser or just the recieving end. If its not just an illusion on the senders end but can also be observed from the recievers end then by jittering the laser on and off a reciever you could theoretically have established FTL morse code. But were getting into frames of reference and time-space wierdness so I dont really know if im fully correct or not. 

Improved Immune System Response- In history disease and infection has caused far far more casualties than combat. In a world where advanced medical supplies are hard to come by any force that could cut losses to disease and infection by even as much as half would have a huge strategic leg up on competition. More Efficient Digestion- Coupled with the improved immune system your super-soldiers can eat food that would sicken others providing more flexibility in logistics. They can spend less time looking for something to eat and more time fighting. Add in the ability to digest plant matter and if all else fails your soldiers could subsist off of grass and leaves in a pinch. Improved Endurance Transportation is hard to come by in the post-apocalypse, soldiers do a lot of walking. problem is, if you are having to march to contact your pace is limited because your men need to be able to fight once they arrive. A regular human in average shape can effectively march 20 miles a day while carrying 30% of their body weight. A very well conditioned soldier can do so with more weight, or go farther with less weight (In the Marines I once marched 40 miles in 12 hours under a 160 pound load but I couldn't walk for 3 days afterwards without limping and wouldn't have been able to fight at all afterwards.) Your super soldiers have been improved and can march 40 miles in 12 hours under a full body load AND be able to fight when they get there. Lower Panic Response- In combat there are mental states we referred to in the Marines by "Coopers Color Code." Green is at rest, yellow is alert, orange is preparing to engage in imminent combat, red is engaged in combat, and black is a total mental break-down (fetal position, rocking back and forth and weeping). Its pretty difficult to predict which soldiers are going to be capable of mentally dealing with the shock of combat, and a sizable and expensive portion of modern infantry training is stress inoculation and mental conditioning. Only about 1 in 10 regular people are capable of entering into combat without suffering a panic response that prevents them from being useful without months of training and indoctrination, after a year of training and indoctrination today even then 10% of people will be totally useless in combat, and you cannot guess which ones until you expose them to combat. Not your super-cobras. Every single one are that 1 in 10 who is totally mentally okay with combat without any sort of prior psychological conditioning. Altered Circadian Rhythm- When a person has been sleep deprived they exhibit impaired decision making and reflexive responses on par with somebody who is legally drunk. Your Super-Cobras can stay awake and active up to 48 hours before becoming impaired, and can recover their regular abilities with only a few hours of sleep. They can now spend more time accomplishing important tasks (Like stomping on farmers heads and stealing anything not nailed down and burning everything that is) instead of sleeping. Coupled with the enhanced durability in a pinch they can march under a full load up to 2 days straight with small rest periods (at the expense of some combat ability mind you). Really REALLY need to cut off an enemy retreat, or get out of enemy striking range, or take a ton of unguarded territory really fast? Super-Cobras can march under full load without sleep for 48 hours and cover up to 160 miles under ideal conditions. Literally no other military group can possibly keep up with their ability to cover ground so fast and achieve objectives so tirelessy. 

I actually build home made firearms as a hobby. I built one recently in my garage modeled after the ones WW2 resistance members built in basements and garages. It was a a semi-auto version of the STEN gun mentioned in a prior comment. it was actually very simple to build, it actually would have been simpler to make it a machine-gun but that's not legal. It took me about 18 hours over a 2 day period utilizing hand files, a dremmel tool, and some drills and metal saws. I welded mine together but in a post apocalyptic society you could just as easily use rivets in the absence of a welder. Gun oil can be anything slippery, animal fats or vegetable oils would work fine, some guns (like the STEN I built) need very very little lubrication at all and seem to "prefer" dry operation. Gunpowder is actually pretty easily made, you just need nitrates, charcoal, and sulfur. They used to produce nitrates in the colonial era by piling animal dung and compost into gravel beds for several months at a time and having lots of people urinate on the whole mess frequently. After several months they would dig up the gravel, wash the tiny nitrate crystals from it, and boil it down for purification. Nitrate crystals also built up naturally in bat caves, saltpeter contains nitrates and can be scraped from cave walls too. all these methods were used regularly in the colonial era, after gathering or producing the nitrates it would then be combined with the aforementioned materials to produce black powder. Keep in mind black powder fouls very quickly and so semi-automatic weapons or machine guns made to use it as a propellant will seize up in pretty short order. also here's a link to an improvised firearms blog cataloging the sorts of guns various criminals and terrorists have cobbled together. $URL$ heres a link to a few "DIY" machinegun schematics (dont attempt to make any, these are for educational purposes only) $URL$ $URL$ and last but not least, here is a complete index of several hundred guns you could theoretically build using low tech means: $URL$
