Marc Lavoie, page 265 of Post-Keynesian Economics: New Foundations: "In fact, the SFC approach is perhaps a misnomer, as several other theories relate stocks and flows in a consistent way. The peculiarity of the post-Keynesian SFC aporoach is that its models truly integrate the real and monetary sides." In other words, do not focus on the name "stock-flow consistent models," the (alleged) contributions go beyond stock-flow consistency. The usefulness of SFC models depends upon your theoretical perspective. If you are already a post-Keynesian economist, SFC models appear to offer a rigourous, standardised framework for setting up economic models. One of the problems facing post-Keynesian approaches is that there are considerable differences of opinion in how to approach economics, and the mathematical models used appear quite different. The hope was that some of the distinctions might disappear if cast into the same mathematical framework. In practice, there remain considerable differences in the behavioural equations between various post-Keynesian schools of thought, so SFC models have not been able to completely unite the various schools of thought. (The text by Lavoie discusses this at greater length.) If you are not post-Keynesian, the usefulness depends upon your views about mainstream macroeconomic models, which I will summarise as dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models here as a shorthand. Please note that there is a massive number of variants of DSGE modelling; my comments here reflect the views of an external observer who is not worried about the distinctions between those models. (Since SFC models have an explicit economic model structure, they are not comparable to unstructured models that are generated by a statistical fitting procedurs.) From a post-Keynesian perspective, DSGE models embed a great many assumptions, pretty much all of which have been criticised. For example, utility maximisation, the production function, rational expectations, general equilibrium, representative households, price determination, and even the distinction between randomness and uncertainty have all come under attack by post-Keynesians. (Since "DSGE models" vary, not all of these assumptions appear in all models. However, it is probably safe to say that almost all "DSGE models" incorporate at least some assumptions that at least some post-Keynesians object to.) SFC models do not embed those assumptions, and so have an advantage if you view those assumptions as incorrect. However, even if you move past the arguments over the assumptions, the tractability of SFC models is an advantage versus pure DSGE models. Standard DSGE models have to make simplifying assumptions in order to remain tractable, such as not having a financial sector. Although certain DSGE models can relax such assumptions, what typically happens is that only some of them can be relaxed at once. In practice, many central banks have had to use hybrid models, that only incorporate some behavioural equations taken from DSGE theory. Although it might not meet a purist's definition of a "SFC model", you could easily create such a hybrid model from a SFC model base. From the perspective of applied mathematics, I would be hard-pressed to give a formal mathematical reason why such a model is not a member of an extended family of "SFC models." (It would not be classified as a DSGE model, as there is no assumption of equilibrium. The behavioural equation is just a bolted on assumption, independent of equilibrium arguments.) However, if you insist that macro models must reflect the optimising choices of households, SFC models are not going to help you very much. 

That’s what the source data goes up to at present: Fed H.6 The fact that it is weekly does not mean that it will be close to available in real time, they presumably need time to get the data for some components of the aggregate. 

There is a theoretical objection to using seasonally adjusted data, which I saw in an essay by Kalman (developer of the Kalman filter); sorry, I cannot find the reference. The argument is that seasonal adjustment is a filter, that has its own dynamics. You are then embedding these filter dynamics within the system that you are modelling. This would be a bad idea in engineering systems, but I am not entirely convinced it matters for economic systems. (My academic background is in engineering control systems.) However, if the variables you are forecasting exhibit roughly the same seasonal pattern, separately seasonally adjusting them might be problematic. Most economic forecasting exercises involve variables with different seasonal patterns, and it is probably easier to work with seasonally adjusted data. You would have to embed the deseasonalisation within your model, which raises model complexity, and probably introduces extra errors that we know that we can explain. If your objective is to forecast the non-seasonally adjusted variable, the usual practice in finanicial market economics is to come up with an estimate of the non-seasonally adjusted variable, then apply the existing seasonal pattern. The main example I have in mind is the forecasting of the CPI index in the inflation-linked markets, where the instruments are linked to the non-adjusted index. These forecasts were short-term (few month horizon), and were expected to be fairly accurate. Even long-term forecasts had a seasonal pattern built into them, since it mattered for relative value even for instruments with longer maturities. Academics may prefer other techniques, but I am unaware of their use in short-term inflation forecasting. If you are attemptng to forecast an aggregate index by forecasting its components, you might need to forecast each component, and then aggregate and seasonally adjust using the same algorithms used by the statistical agency. However, it’s rare that you can get the level of accuracy needed for this to matter. 

At the time of writing this answer, I would note that the question is somewhat confusing. The issue is that the question uses the common definition of the word "money" which corresponds to the term "wealth" in economics, while "money" has a narrow technical meaning (referring to the "money supply aggregates"). This section is the part that is confusing. 

This answer starta out with how illegal transactions are normally treated in the national accounts. Transactions that are just attempts to evade currency controls are a special case, discussed later. If the illegal transaction was somehow measured, there would be two entries: the entry for the illegal good/service on the trade account, and the cash flow in the capital account. That is, they are interpreted in the same way as legal activities. Therefore, in response to: 

Most versions of IS/LM that I am aware of have only one interest rate, and if we want to be strict, cannot be applied to a yield curve. (Is “the” interest rate the short rate set by the central bank, or the market-determined bond yield?) There are standard ways of thinking about this, but I never look at IS/LM, so I will not comment. If you look at any modern textbook on fixed income pricing, you will see that long-term bond yields are equal to the expected path of the short rate plus a term premium. If we ignore the term premium, this means that a 10-year bond is roughly equal to the expected average of the policy rate over the next 10 years. During a rate hike cycle, the typical pattern is for the yield curve to flatten. This can be seen by looking at data on the FRED database: Link to FRED 2/10 year slope. This is because the market generally expects the policy rate to stop rising after a few years; and so the average policy rate during any maturity converges towards the terminal rate. (Term premia etc. will affect that.) Under most economic models, increased spending - “all else equal” - would at least raise nominal GDP in the short run (or at the minimum, force the central bank to raise the policy rate, which is what matters here). Whether that increase represents higher real GDP, or greate inflation, becomes a controversial question. (One could argue that an inflation-targeting central bank can cancel out the effect of fiscal policy, but that then requires the central bank to correctly forecast how to tighten monetary policy to exactly offset fiscal policy. Such a move might not be considered holding everything “all else equal.”) If market participants believe that the central bank’s policy rate is approximated by a Taylor Rule, then this would presumably lead to higher policy rates. However, it is possible that there could be spare capacity in the economy, and interest rates could be unchanged, and inflation remains near the central bank’s implicit target. Market participants will react to new information about growth and the policy rate. This can be seen by looking at yield changes on the the dates of important data releases, auch as Nonfarm Payrolls. A lack of reaction to the State if the Union speech may just tell us that it had no new information. 

As seen above, aggregate profits are driven by various sources of money inflows to the business sector that are not expenses. Importantly, gross investment is a cash outflow that does not directly result in an expense. (Depreciation comes with a lag.) Therefore, firms can run profits without requiring others to have losses. 

The payment of interest is straightforward. The central bank is a bank, and pays interests on deposits in exactly the same way as any other bank. If the central bank wants to pay $1 in interest to a depositor, it: 

This is a difficult question in that it is very difficult to prove that something is impossible. However, based on the types of analysis done in financial markets, estimating supply and demand curves is obviously difficult to do. The usual methods for valuing assets in financial markets is to rely on some relative value versus a similar asset, or discounted cash flow. For a currency, we can compare the prices of similar items (hourly wages, goods prices) to get fair value. However, I am unaware of items sold at fixed prices in crypto currencies that would allow us to use a similar valuation method. As for supply and demand, unless we have a reason to know that supply and demand curves follow some particular parameterisation, all that it says that for every buyer there is a seller. A price change can either be explained by the supply curve or the demand curve shifting (or both); we have no idea what happened. There is no clear method to go from observed transaction data to back out supply and demand curves. For example, imagine there are a sequence of transactions at rising prices. Is that because there was an increased demand by buyers, or was it the result of existing owners being less willing to sell? Since every transaction has two sides, we have no idea. All we know for sure is that the price went up - which we could see by just looking at the time series of prices. Furthermore, prices can change without any transactions. In the financial markets, prices jump on the release of economic or corporate news. This is much more easily interpreted as a change in fair value, rather than a shift in demand or supply curves. Finally, it is unclear what a supply or demand curve represents. In the short term, a crypto currency supply is fixed (at least until the next coin is “mined”). How exactly can the quantity supplied or demanded change? In other words, probably the only way to see whether “supply and demand” work is to build a model that works. I am unaware of any successful attempts in other asset markets to build such a model, so you have little guidance on how it could be done. Addendum: It is difficult to control supply to keep an asset near a target level. Preventing the price from going up is easy, as you could just flood the market. Stopping the price from falling is difficult. You cannot destroy currency units held by people, and so you cannot reduce the amount outstanding. If people want to sell at a lower price, there is little you can do except buy the crypto up with some kind of currency reserves. (Which is how currency pegs are defended.) However, currency pegs tend to fail. (I believe some crypto currencies follow a backing strategy; I do not know how popular those currencies are are.)
