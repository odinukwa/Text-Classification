Due to a lack of imagination, how could we obtain non-trivial examples of such positive upper density sequences and what could the 3AP's mean? The example given is a Bohr set $$ \{ n \in \mathbb{Z}: \big|\big| \alpha n - \theta \big|\big|_{\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}} < \epsilon \} $$ These sets look fairly regular at first glance but have a mild degree of randomness. Also square-free numbers, which are highly dependent on the primes. In this discussion of primes and Dirichlet processes I found just one more. The paper is gone. Possibly: $\{ n : p | n \to p < \sqrt{n}\}$ numbers with no prime divisors greater than $\sqrt{n}$ (as implied here). In fact, Dirichlet characters do it as well, we could have a character $$\chi: (\mathbb{Z}/7\mathbb{Z})^\times \to (\mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z}, +)$$ and ask for $\phi^{-1}(0) \subseteq \mathbb{Z}$. What do we do with these arithmetic sequences once we find them??

The first definition sort of makes sense to me. Another possibility is that I have invented my own definition of approximate group, deserving its own term. 

The equation $x^3+y^3 +z^3+c\, xyz= 0$ defines a non-singular elliptic curve $X$ in $\mathbb{C}P^2$ projective space. In fact, how do we prove it has genus 1 both as an algebraic curve and as a Riemann surface? Since $H^1(X,\mathbb{C})\simeq \mathbb{C}^2$ what are the explicit representatives of the de Rham cohomology? There should be two of them. 

In Quantum Field Theory and the Jones Polynomial, Witten showed how to get the Jones polyomial as a Wilson Loop in Chern-Simons theory. The Chern-Simons Lagrangian is $$ \mathcal{L} = \frac{k}{4\pi} \int_M \mathrm{Tr}(A \wedge dA + \frac{2}{3} A \wedge A \wedge A )$$ Here you're integrating over a 3-manifold (e.g. $M= S^3)$, but you're also integrating over the moduli space of connections $A$ on $M$, so $A$ takes values in some lie algebra, e.g. $\mathfrak{g} = \mathfrak{su}(2)$. Based on this information they can calculate the partition function for $M = S^3, \mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{su}(2)$ to be $$ Z(S^3) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{k+2}}\sin \frac{\pi}{k+2} $$ In this theory, one can also define ``Wilson loops" over closed curves in your 3-manifold, i.e. knots. $$ W_R(C) = \mathrm{Tr}_R\left[ P \exp \int_C A \cdot dx \right]$$ Remember if we exponentiate an element of the Lie algebra $A \in \mathfrak{g}$ then $e^A$ is going to be an element of the Lie group $G$. So $e^{\int_C A dx} \in G$. Proving the Wilson loops give you Jones polynomials involves the Atiyah-Singer index theorem and some surgery theory of manifolds. Wilson loops can be used to derive Khovanov Homology. 

I'm reading a paper on the statistics of number fields. How does one build an extension of Q with Galois group, S(3)? How is it possible to find all isomorphism classes of S(3) field extensions of Q with given discriminant? 

If you know the path exists, you can pick a vertex at random (from a side) and find all the vertices reachable from it pretty quickly. If you don't reach the other side, just color those vertices (and whatever part you closed off). Then try again. This process will terminate after finitely many steps. 

Theorem 3 Let $D$ be a "fundamental discriminant" $n \neq 0$ be a whole number. Then the total number $R(n)$ of representation of $n$ by primitive forms of discriminant $D$ is given by $$ R(n) = \sum_{m|n} \chi_D(m) $$ where $m$ is a divisor of $n$ and $\chi_D(m)$ is a character. In particlar, $R(n)$ and all $R(n,f)$ are finite. Proof There are no imprimitive forms, so we can leave outthe word "primitive" in the theorem. Let $R^\ast(n)$ be the number of inequivalent primitive representations of $n$ by (any) forms of discriminant $D$. Obviously $$ R(n) = \sum_{g \geq 1, g^2 | n} R^\ast (n/g^2) $$ since every representation is a multiple of a primitive one. The main step in the proof is the formula $$ R^\ast(n) = \{ b \pmod {2n} \big| b^2 \equiv D \pmod{4n}\} $$ Then he proceeds to explain the notion of a group action and variants of the orbit stabilizer formula Let $G$ be a group $X$ and $Y$ be two sets and $S \subset X \times Y$. Then we can study the diagonal group action $(x,y) \mapsto (gx,gy)$ and observe the quotient sets $X/G$ as well as $S/G$. 

In some physics papers I seem some discussion of group cohomology of finite groups. The discussions I have found in books are very abstract with a few concrete results. How can we talk about the cohomology group $H^3(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}, U(1))$ ? These are equivalence classes of functions in three variables $\phi(a,b,c) \to U(1)$. We can we write these down in somewhat explicit form: $$ (a,b,c) \in \big(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}\big)^3\mapsto e^{2\pi i \, f(a,b,c)} \in U(1) $$ An example of this more concrete approach to group cohomology might be found in Xiao Gang Wen's Symmetry protected topological orders and the group cohomology of their symmetry group, where he even discusses $H^4(G, U(1))$ for various finite groups $G$. In fact we get all cohomology groups: $$ H^d(\mathbb{Z}_n, U(1)) = \left\{ \begin{array}{cl} U(1) & d = 0 \\ \mathbb{Z}_1 & d \text{ is even}\\ \mathbb{Z}_n & d \text{ is odd} \end{array} \right. $$ We eveen get that $\omega_1^m(k) = e^{2\pi i mk/n} \in H^1(\dots)$. This is in Appendix J.3 of Wen's paper. But what is this telling us about modular arithmetic? And how did this fit into his larger program? 

K-theory Kitaev seems to feel the Altland-Zirnbauer classification was incomplete in dimensions > 3. He is also the first to mention Bott periodicity. Here K-theory is read literally as "linear algebra over matrices with elements that are functions of the base space". Classical random matrix theory is a 0-dimensional case where the base space is $\{ pt \} $. In higher dimensions these become related to the Clifford algebras. (More to say as I learn.) 

In general for any number field $K$ and lattice cone $V \subseteq \mathcal{O}_K$ in the ring of integers we could try to define: $$ \sum_{x \in V \subset \mathcal{O}_K} x $$ So I wonder if someone has attempted to define such summations and what they evaluate to. 

A somewhat precise question Let $(x,y,z) \in \mathbb{R}P^2$ be three real numbers (up to proportion) and Brun continued fraction algorithm: $$ T: (x,y,z) \mapsto \text{sort}(x-y, y, z) $$ what are the closed orbits of this map? I have no idea how to make this precise. The traditional continued fraction algorithm can also be made subtrative: $$ T_0: (x,y) \mapsto \text{sort}(x-y, y) $$ and we can record how many times the coordinates get switched in the process - $(12)$ if $x > y$ and $(21)$ if $y > x$ - and this leads to a continued fraction of sorts. The statement is then: 

I'm reading about the Gauss hypergeometric differential equation: \[ x(1-x)y'' + (c - (a + b + 1)x)y' - aby =0 \] Apparently this is a kind of Fuchsian differential equation: \[ \left(\begin{array}{c} \frac{dy}{dx} \\\\ \frac{dz}{dx} \end{array} \right) = \left(\begin{array}{cc} 0 & 1 \\\\ -ab & \frac{c_1}{x} + \frac{c_2}{x-1}\end{array} \right) \left(\begin{array}{c} y \\\\z \end{array} \right) \] whose sections define a local system over a sphere with 3 punctures, $\mathbb{C}\backslash \{0,1 \infty \}$. We can worry about the monodromy of ODE solutions about these three points $0,1,\infty$. The paper I'm reading says Fuchsian equations may be is solved by a Selberg-like integral. \[ y(x)= \int_\Delta s^{c-b}(s-1)^{c-a-1} (s-x)^{-b} \, ds \] Where the integral is over a "twisted cycle" $\Delta$ in $H_1(\mathbb{C}\backslash\{ 0,1,x\}, L^* )$. 

In my ODE class, we proved that if exp(L) = exp(L') then the eigenvalues are congruent mod 2πi. Here L, L' are two nxn matrices. I wanted to know if something more precise was true. In a way, we should expect that matrix logs are multiple valued since this is the case in $\mathbb{C}$. log(reiθ) = log r + iθ + 2πik with $k \in \mathbb{Z}$. In this way we can construct an branched infinite cover of the complex plane. We'll define multiplcity mod 2πi of an eigenvalue λ to be the number of eigenvalues congruent to λ mod 2πi up to multiplicity. If exp(L) = exp(L') are the spectra of L and L' the same including multiplicity mod 2πi? To put this another way, I could imagine two 5x5 matrices exp(L) = exp(L') where 

This looks an awful lot like the equidstibution of primes $\mathfrak{p} \in \mathbb{Z}[i]$. Is there always this link between complex multiplication and the angles of primes? He points to Deuring's Theorem 

For any prime number $p$ we can define a Cayley graph with integer vertices and edges: \begin{eqnarray} V &=& \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z} \\ E &=& \{ (x, x\pm 1), (x, x \pm 2) : x \in V \} \end{eqnarray} What is the spectrum of this graph? I think that is an easy one. Then I would like to add one edge: $$ E' = E \cup \bigg\{ \big(0\;,\; 0 + \tfrac{p+1}{2}\big) \bigg\} $$ How does the spectrum of my new graph change with respect to the old ones? If I write out the matrix I think I get (here for $p = 5$) in general a band matrix and even a Toeplitz matrix $$ \left[ \begin{array}{ccccc} 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \end{array} \right]$$ Or even better we could just define the transfer operator (arithmetic taken mod $p$): $$ f(x) \stackrel{T}{\mapsto} \frac{f(x+1)+ f(x+2)+f(x-1)+f(x-2)}{4} $$ I don't immediately recall the eigenvalues but they were quite explicit. I believe spectrum is the set of roots of unity $\lambda \in \{ = e^{2\pi i \, \frac{k}{p}}: 0 \leq k < p-1 \}$ but the eigenvectors change with the choice of generators (in our case $\pm1, \pm 2$). These notes say I have defined $C\big(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}, (1,2)\big)$ but I could have used any generators. And the eigenvalues are all real. We can predict how the eigenvalues change when we add the single edge: $\big(0, \frac{1}{2}(p-1)\big)$ e.g. using Hadamard's variation formulas how much does it move? 

So a reasonable goal would be to quantify where and how much the inverted checkerboard correlates with these patterns. Or how quickly they are converging to absolute chaos. 

Then thy considered the hitting time for the Y-axis: $T = \text{inf} \{ t: X_t = 0 \}$. In the time-change parameterization: $$ H_T := T^{\gamma, *}_{\pi/2} $$ The $Y$-corrdinate at the hitting time $T$ (or $H_T$) is distributed as the Cauchy distribution. \begin{eqnarray} \log | \mathbb{C}_1 | &\stackrel{\text{law}}{=}& \beta_{T^{\gamma, *}_{\pi/2}} \\ \frac{2}{\pi} \, \log | \mathbb{C}_1 | & \stackrel{\text{law}}{=} & \beta_{T^{\gamma, *}_{1}} \end{eqnarray} The log-radius and angle $\beta$ and $\gamma$ are independent Brownian motions, over time. I was not able to varify this change of equations: $$ \mathbb{E} \left[ e^{i\lambda \frac{2}{\pi} \log | \mathbb{C}_1|} \right] \stackrel{1}{=} \mathbb{E} \left[ e^{i\lambda \beta_{T^{\gamma,*}_{\pi/2}} } \right] \stackrel{2}{=} \mathbb{E} \left[ e^{ - \frac{\lambda^2}{2} T_1^{\gamma, *} } \right] \stackrel{3}{=} \frac{1}{\cosh \lambda} $$ I wish the authors would come up with different variable names for the hitting times. Why 2 and 3 are correct? And can anyone explain the bigger picture of why these authors feel special values of zeta might be connected to these random processes? 

I guess the theorem is that any $L^1$ function over the real line can be spanned by translates of a single function whose Fourier transform is nowhere vanishing on $\mathbb{R}$. 

You have a closed curve on a Euclidean manifold $c: S^1 \to M$ and a tangent vector $v \in T_{x_0} M$ which you parallel translate around $c$ using the Levi-Civita connection. The monodromy representative of this curve should be a rotation on $T_{x_0}M$ (which is a plane in our case). Could you have gotten this angle by integrating the curvature over the area enclosed by the curve? What is the name of that result? 

Higher Rank What do those Satake parameters have to do with the splitting of primes? In our case $a_p = 2x$ where $p = x^2 + y^2$. Perhaps there is a higher-rank analogue. Originally I was merely going to ask about other CM elliptic curves. Which compact group is being used when we discuss elliptic curves over complex multiplication? I think it's $G = SU(2)$. In the non-CM case, the splitting of primes play no role and I wonder what is happening there? Perhaps the additional symmetry is restricting the location of the angles $\theta_\mathfrak{p}$. 

Kac notes he couldn't find a similar paper by Littlewood and Offord from 1938 (didn't have Google!) Recently this kind of problem has been discussed by Tao (various estimates) or Zelditch (holomorphic sections on Riemann surfaces. 

To me seen seems a "light bulb" these difficult inequalities from functional analysis are based on intuition from convex geometry - especially since nobody draws pictures in a functional analysis textbook. 

This statement (from Hardy's Divergent Series) look oddly vacuous and not related to divergent series. As best I could tell: 

The sum is $\lambda(n) + \lambda'(n)$ and the product is $\lambda(\lambda'(n))$ with $n \in \mathbb{Z}$. This idea is connected with rotation number of oriented homomorphisms of the circle. 

What kind of 3-manifolds can arise as hypersurfaces $\{ f(x,y,z,w) = 0\} \subset \mathbb{R}^4$? Can they have nontrivial H1 or H2? 

It has been over a year since I asked. The rumor it was being worked on (in fact clearly stated by the authors). I note that two papers came out yesterday: 

Primary sources on anti de Sitter space would be appreciated. They do offer a few pieces of information by way of analogy: $$ S^2 \simeq \frac{O(3)}{O(2)} \text{ and } AdS_3 = \frac{O(2,2)}{O(1,1)} $$ Therefore, AdS is a homogenous space. There are Poincaré coordinates, but Wikipedia warns us these do not cover all of anti de-Sitter space. They point to the notes of Ingemar Bengtsson (which does have lots of pictures! but also missing quite a few). 

Cedric Boutillier's discussion of says his bead model is a bi-infinite analogue of this uniform interlacing picture for GUE. 

Something I really enjoy about Tao's writing is that he proves the same theorem over and over. While I complain a bit sometimes about clarity, this is a heuristic that I very much believe in. This question is about the Wigner Semi-Circle Law from his 254A random matrix theory. He does it two different ways: 

What kind of information did we lose after these reductions? What are some elements of $\mathrm{Diff}(S^2)$ you can build? REMARK: One comment suggested I use vector fields to construct my diffeomorphism. If I have a smooth section of the tangent bundle $T(S^2)$ can it be "integrated" to a diffeomorphism of $S^2 \to S^2$ ? 

I am seeing the Hardy-Littlewood Tauberian Theorem phrased in several different ways. Are they all equivalent? A If $\sum a_n x^n \sim \frac{1}{1-x}$ then $\sum_{k=0}^n a_k = n$ B If $\sum a_n e^{-ny} = \frac{1}{y}$ then $ \sum_{k=0}^n a_k = n$ Thse are obviously related by a change of variables. How about this one? C If $ \sum \frac{a_n nx^n}{1-x^n} \to \frac{A}{1-x} $ and $ n a_n > -1$ then $\sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k = A$
