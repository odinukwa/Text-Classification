Om is not directly linked to prana, but all prana would be part of Om. There are practices of saying Om on your breath, which are considered to be beneficial. Om is essentially Brahman. Om and what it represents is a very positive and optimistic view of the universe and its totality. It accepts nor rejects anything, it is all that exists, and it is perfection. Om also has influence in Tibetan cultures and philosophies. In the mantra 

Functional Contextualism Conciliationism Ambiguity Internalism and externalism Empiricism Rationalism Metaphysical Anti-Realism And on and on (Feel free to edit and add theories I may have left out.) All of these theories have their own stances on what makes knowledge valid, and how to justify proposition A. 

The Raven Paradox will take this further I will attempt to equate the two change the urn to Earth, and the white balls to swans. 

Did any philosophers discuss overcoming ennui/boredom? I read this question and its answer, but I am less interested in a definition of boredom and more interested in direct approaches or theories that aim at removing it. 

Note that we changed the urn to the world, this is like if we pulled a pair of all black sneakers out of the urn. But of course we must ask, what do the sneakers and the white balls have in common? How can we correlate them? Other than there being one more item counted in the world that is not a non-white ball, there is nothing to presuppose what the next item removed from the urn will be, perhaps a black ball? (I know you said not to nit pick this point but....) That aside... if we pull 7 nonwhite items that are not balls do we increase the belief by a factor of 7 to the original factor of increase? I think I need to ask you a question of how you are referring to events and such in B-Theory to tie it into this answer. 

You were looking at a digital reconstruction of an image taken through my phones camera. This image contains within it sunlight that was being reflected off the moon, ~8min before the time at which I took the picture. Before it could be digitally reconstructed on your viewing device, it had to travel across the air, (possibly even to the tower in view) server wires, and your internet connection etc.... These statements would be considered valid knowledge by the majority of philosophers. Barring of course the theories with exceptions in my previous answer. 

Person A says "I want A, therefor it ought to be A." Person B says "I want B, therefor it ought to be B." Let's say A and B are not compatible and the statement A xor B must remain true. Let us also say that both people are "Objectivists" and so both will act in their best interest to strive for their own goal. One, both, or neither will succeed. But who wins out is irrelevant. Neither one will be able to convince the other that there goal ought to be the case. Both goals cannot be an ought, only one, as the two goals are not compatible. 

So Reg says the word water, and his mind is referring to H2O Opp says water, and his mind is referring to XYZ Their meaning is different XYZ != H2O Even though XYZ and H20 have all the same properties (This I think is where the weakness in Putnam's argument really is... but if we diverge here the thought experiment falls apart) If you have cats that are identical twins, and you name one H20 and one XYZ you can call them the wrong names, and they can even react how you would expect, but your meaning and your reference do not match. If this makes you change your mind about the meaning being the same then perhaps you could rethink if the thought experiment disproves functionalism. I myself have never read or heard discussion of this particular thought experiment in conjunction with functionalism. For those that want a quick summary of the original argument As for how it might be a problem for functionalism, I'd say it is because Opp and Reg have completed the same function with a different intent. However this is not my go to argument against functionalism, and I would not present it as such myself. 

Regular earth guy is pointing at a glass of H20 Opposite earth lady points at a glass of XYZ They both say this is water. Let us shelve the question of if this is merely a naming issue for now, as well as the question of if things have the same (equal in all regards other than position) properties, they fall under the same class. Though I find these questions highly relevant to philosophy, neither of these debates will help with this thought experiment. So we have from your question : 

Still only one can be true at once. For our reality at least deduction seems to hold. For other realities, who knows, there really is no way for us to tell. It seems like it is impossible for us, based in this reality, to imagine a round square, or a square circle, for example. A reality that does not follow the rules of deductive logic might be impossible for us to visualize in any form. As for it existing, that is a whole different can of worms. 

Let's try a more concrete and simpler example then.... Here is an image of the moon through a sun roof of a car : 

The hard problem of consciousness is not a question of "consciousness has the property P" so much as it is a question of why do we experience P as P. For instance if you see the color red, or taste bacon, you have the qualia of such experiences. So Consciousness has the quality red (or the taste of bacon) in those cases. This is not the question that the hard problem of consciousness is seeking to answer however. Let us disregard for a moment the inverted qualia argument/thought experiment, as interesting as the topic is, and let us say we are both staring at a patch of red paint, and chewing on bacon. There is nothing controversial about the sentences: "I see red" and "I taste bacon" as we point to our mouths with one hand and the patch of paint with the other. The hard problem of consciousness is WHY we experience red as red, and not some other color, and WHY we experience the taste of bacon when we chew it, and not, let us say, chocolate. Or why we experience anything at all because of the physical state of our brains? How do we go from a physical combination of things to an experience of red, or bacon, or any other qualia? So no, the hard problem of consciousness is not a question of Operationalization, but a question of explanation. Consider this quote by Chalmers from this article 

No, here is an example : "Spiders have 8 legs" This is a fact about spiders, and would be considered an objective truth. In contrast to "Spiders are creepy because they have 8 legs" a subjective opinion. It does not matter if the majority of a population believes that "Spiders have 4 legs" as they would quite simply be wrong. 

He is calling Arthur dumb, plain and simple. Not just dumb, but among the dumbest. His choice of the word crude adds yet another jab, as it was one of Schopenhauer's go to words when taunting the intellect of those he thought beneath him. 

You do not need to know or believe that spiders have 8 legs for it to be true. You could live oblivious to the knowledge that spiders even exist, and they would still have 8 legs. If you observe a spider you will see it has 8 legs. If you rip a leg off of a spider you will see it has 7 legs. If you show this spider to someone else they will say, that is odd, why does this spider have 7 legs? When you explain that you ripped one leg off they will resolve the confusion that arose from being presented with a case that is contrary to their belief that spiders have 8 legs. 

If you made it this far without thinking about your stance on free will, congratulations, you avoided all the red herrings. On the subject of the straw-man you can't really avoid them, only knock them down, and return the other debater to presenting your argument accurately. It is the difference between correction and focus, being able to say "That is not what I said" vs. "What you just said has no connection to the topic at hand" 

These are the rules you need to cite, ignore my comment, a disjunction introduction is not necessary. I was thinking it was of the form A V B not A ^ B. 

There are many other formulations of the hard problem of consciousness. To hear David Chalmers himself talk about Consciousness in a TED talk that is only 1 year old (yes he is still alive) click here You'll see that some approaches to the hard problem of consciousness are to deny that there is a problem at all. Some do this by denying the existence of qualia. Some do this in other ways. Those who accept it as a problem are still scratching their heads. The individual that comes forward with the solution to this problem will likely become quite famous. 

Say we have knowledge that consists of arbitrary propositions A, B, C We might say If A ^ B then C A exists B exists Conclusion C exists. This argument is logically valid. But what if B does not really exist? Then the argument is not logically sound. For this example let's say that A does in fact exist. Valid knowledge would be A. Invalid knowledge would be B. A is sometimes called Justified true belief Because A is true We believe A and We are justified in believing A (Because it is true) So far this is pretty uncontroversial, but epistemology is a large field. The study of knowledge, and how it is acquired raises many philosophical questions. Further, it is an area that could be considered "practical philosophy" in that knowing how to correctly acquire correct knowledge would be a skill set with practical uses in the world. As such it has a large impact to science and other fields. So one who is skeptical of A might ask you "How do you know A is the case?" If you merely reply "Because A is true" they likely will not be satisfied. You must in some way show that A is true, not merely claim it. Here are some theories of epistemology : 

You can try to say there is more here, claim that is how it is, that there is some deeper meaning to this quote, but I have yet to encounter any reason why there is more here. In fact those that have made such claims, have the very knots that Wittgenstein is trying to untangle within their thoughts. From Culture and Value - L.W : 

So lets say that you and the 99 other people are pointing at an object parked across the street in a lot. You all agree it is a blue car. Blue car in your spoken language briefly touches the surface of the object across the street. It has a specific set of properties that make it blue, and a car. Cars have certain functional requirements, these requirements might be broken, like a broken starter keeps it from being drivable. Most have 4 wheels etc etc. Some philosophers tried to find the smallest logical chunks in langauge. Others argued that these small chunks did not fully capture the discussed object. Even further some argued that in defining the object we must also define the definitions with vigor and precision in order to correctly and fully describe the object in question. However, when the 1 other guy says "Nah, that is a teal buggy", one thing remains true. The object you two point at is the same object. Now, there are of course situations in which people disagree over things and are both attempting to communicate about different topics or objects, however it would vastly expand the scope of this example. The 100 people including yourself point at the object across the street and say blue car. The one person stands firm in his belief and says blue buggy. Same object. That object has properties. Some which are debatable. Others not so much. Lets say another person comes along and says, "Nah That is a Mazda suchinwhat, new 2016 model, seafoam green with a tinge of white in the light. Wheels are randombrand on a carbon fiber alloy blend. It goes 0 to agh speed in faster than blah blah blah" A portion of your 99 are swayed, the other one is swayed. "Oh yea, I see the Mazda logo!" exclaims one of your original 99 agreers. Yet they still agree, to them seafoam green looks blue (this is subjectivity ) but scanned the car will match the factory Seafoam Green hex code perfectly. Now you are there with the other 101 people, you see the logo as well, you are all talking about the same object. As for soloipsm, did you predict with certainty every move of the 101 people? If not, why do you hide things from yourself? Perhaps your mind typed this mentally before you read it. I doubt it though. Do we write in the same style? My answer, and your question contain some objective properties. # of words, for example. Some things can be reduced to subjectivity, but to argue against objective reality is a fool's chore. Even if all my/our/your experiences are subjective, there still is a qualia of what those experiences are like to us, you, or me. We might not be able to perfectly communicate it, but we experience it directly, and it is such as it is... perhaps one day langauge will fully surpass the requirements to completely communicate what our subjective experience is to one another. Until then we can only paint a picture with the words we have, and try to keep them in scope of what we describe. Lastly, were any of the 3 positions really wrong? A common gem from Eastern thought was that there is no objective answer, but that some answers are better than others. In this case likely the last joiner to the discussion. However, it seems like if you say an object has a property, and it indeed has it , you are capturing that aspect of the universe, and that it is an objective truth.
