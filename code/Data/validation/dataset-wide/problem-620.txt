One company that our city gets most of it's racks from is Dero. They have a variety of styles. Alternatively, Uline wave and u-shaped bike racks as suggested by Batman. My personal preference for racks is a bunch of U racks, a 'coathanger' style rack, or a wave rack in that order. I'm looking for a rack that I can ulock the frame to and secure both wheels with a cable and hold multiple bikes in close proximity. When Installing parking racks, be sure not to put them too close to the wall so that it eliminates 1/2 of the rack's capacity. I see this a lot with coat hanger style racks, which can be loaded from 2 sides, but are often butted against a wall, so they have 1/2 the possible capacity. Whatever you do, don't ever get toaster racks like these. There is no good way to use a ulock on them. They wind up forcing users to park bikes in awkward ways to lock securely. 

I can't really debate whether your drivetrain will have less wear. However, the symptoms of wear are much less pronounced on a single speed drivetrain (assuming you are not using a tensioner). You're just not going to get the same chain skipping / jumping issues you would on a derailleur system. The same thing is applicable to internally geared hubs. It's still important to check your chain for wear and replace as needed. Keep in mind, a worn chain is going to keep wearing down your drivetrain. However, it's not going to really suffer much in terms of performance degradation until everything is really worn. Also, see Sheldon's comments on extending single speed chain land sprocket life by using even numbered cogs and chainrings. 

I have a kurt Kinetic trainer. I find that it's sometimes hard to remove the bike from the trainer, as the knobs are really hard to turn. I thought about putting grease on the threads which clamp on the skewer. Is this a good idea or not? Am I likely overtightening the tension? 

Yes. $URL$ $URL$ It took me a while to confirm that these were indeed the panaracer fat b nimbles due to the low resolution of the image. However, it's definitely a panaracer, and there are only so many models that size. Like BEVR1337 said, I may have some issues if using a front derailleur, it looks like this should clear the frame fine. Rims appear to be velocity duallys which are a bit wider than the blunts, so if it is a good fit with these rims, the narrower blunt 35s should be totally fine. 

I know that shock pumps are meant for high pressure applications so that they can withstand high pressures needed by suspension shocks. However, can I use a shock pump to inflate my tire in a pinch if I run out of CO2? How would it compare to a standard mini-pump in terms of volume? 

It's hard to tell whether you are talking about the nut that sits on the outside of the forks or on the inside (that locks against the cones to keep the hub together). If you can make it to any bike shop they should be able to hook you up with the missing nut. If you absolutely must order online, amazon probably has something for both: Track Nut or Lock Nut 

Probably going to fit a bit small, but you may be able to make it work. Try it out, jack the seat up a lot. My guess is that you'll feel a bit 'smashed' due to the top tube not being long enough. Might be able to compensate with a setback seatpost and/or a longer stem.

You want an old man mountain Sherpa rack. It can be attached at the hub level and can be installed via hose clamps or fender mounts on rear seatstays. It is made to even accommodate most disc brake equipped bikes. $URL$ 

It may not be a bent derailleur, but a bent derailleur hanger. You can buy the park tool derailleur alignment gauge and bend it back to shape or have a shop do it for you. After that I would check the cable tension, disconnect the rear derailleur cable and make sure that the chain stays on the smallest cog to start and then slowly the tension appropriately to make sure it shifts in to all gears properly. Also, check to make sure you don't have a loose bolt on your friction shifter that is allowing too much play in the lever, which may let it slide out of the desired position. 

As for the vehicle most buyers need only consider the size of hitch they have, 1 1/4" or 2" are the typical sizes and try to get a hitch of the same size. You can usually get an adapter to fit a rack that is sized differently than the hitch. Typically the hitch racks sit a bit back off the rear of your car to accommodate rear features of most vehicles. I'd only be worried if they had a spare tire mounted on the rear of the vehicle. 

If you ride SPD shoes, Buy Shimano MW-81 winter boots. They are waterproof with gore-tex lining. Water generally can only enter via the top of the shoe. Combine these with gaiters and you'll be very dry. I find these good down to about freezing and are great for spring / fall commuting or off road riding in sloppy conditions. Also for SPD shoes in colder conditions, buy 45nrth fasterkatt or Wolvhammer boots. They are basically a cycling shoe with a waterproof bootie integrated in to the shoe. Fasterkatt is for moderate cold, Wolvhammer is for sub freezing weather. These are pricey, but very effective. Again, water can infiltrate through the top of the cuff, so gaiter covering the upper area will reduce the chance of that. Shoe covers will help a bit, but most shoes are not sealed around the cleat and are very vented on the sides and may have water infiltration there, and will likely fill up with water if you step in even a shallow puddle. Neoprene socks (look for ones called SealSkinz) are recommended by some for very wet and cold weather. You can wear these with normal shoes. Your feet may get a bit wrinkly, but it keeps the hot water in and the cold water out. If it's not cold, then just deal with wet feet getting wet. Rinse your shoes when you get home and dry them out with newspaper, a hair dryer, or get yourself a fan powered boot dryer. Wear wool socks as well, since if they get wet, they still retain some insulating ability. For you legs, a downtube mounted grunge guard does a good job and can be installed and removed relatively easily and doesn't tend to get in the way of suspension or big tires as much. 

If you're at all concerned, just go for the natural colored cambium saddle, which I don't think is dyed, so it shouldn't be an issue with that one. I have not had any issue with colors tranferring from the slate colored saddle to my lighter colored synthetic shorts. However, After riding the slate colored saddle, the gray faded and now appears more brown. So I would avoid the slate colored saddle if you're concerned. I actually had the reverse problem using the natural colored cambium saddle which I was demoing from a local shop. The dye in my dark indigo colored jeans transferred to the saddle and turned it somewhat blue. 

Go Singlespeed or use an Internally geared hub to avoid the problem entirely. May need an eccentric bottom bracket or a bike with horizontal dropouts to pull this off without adding dangly bits like a chain tensioner. However, chain tensioner a tend to sit a bit further out of the way and are less likely to be damaged. 

On first thought, I would say NO due to the lack of cantilever brake mounts. Caliper brakes which come on this bike limit tire choice a lot. But if you don't plan to do traditional cross racing and are just looking to ride this bike on fire roads and gravel paths, then I think you can make it work fine. The issues you'd have in a cross race would be dealing with a buildup of mud and leaves between your tire and brake / fork and it may be harder to get traction on loose ground, mud, and sand. However, this bike originally shipped with 700x28c tires, so you may be able to bump up the tire size a little bit. You may want to try some 700x30c tires like Michelin Mud Cross tires. Even if you can't get bigger tires squeezed in there, I take my road bike with 700x28 tires on this kind of terrain all the time, so just go with the biggest thing you can fit. You'll enjoy the ride a lot more on fat tires. You could also consider throwing on some Tektro R539 brakes which should clear 32c tires if your current brakes don't. This is what ships on the All-city Mr. Pink which claims 32c clearance. Here's a great link to a vintage trek catalog with the orignal specs for the bike: $URL$ 

I'm looking for good software to help me map out routes that I have not done before and create cue sheets and probably also printable maps. I plan to use this for my own rides, planning group rides, and maybe even alleycat routes. Things like elevation profile would be nice too. Optionally, this would also have a cue sheet viewer app available for my smartphone for reference. It doesn't have to navigate me, just show me a list of turns and notes. I don't really care if it supports upload of routes from gps units or a mobile app since I'm using it more for future rides than past rides. I rarely do the same ride twice. However, some people find this very useful. I'm willing to pay money for a good app, so free isn't neccesary, but it's nice. The key thing is it has to be easy to map out a route and generate a cue sheet and add notes.
