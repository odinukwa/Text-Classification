If there was a magic solution to preventing plantar fasciitis, then no one would have it anymore! Different things work for different people. It's important to find out what works for you. This can be done with experimentation or the help of a specialist. One thing I would caution against is just throwing more padding at it! There is something wrong with your stride and the padding may hide it for while, but it will eventually come back. I say pay particular attention to how you're walking while wearing your walking shoes that do not give you any problems. Then walk around in your sandals or your boots. Pay attention to how your feet land in the different footwear, and how you transition to your next stride. Find the stride that works best for you and practice it. I know it's strange to have to think about walking again, it's supposed to be something we just do, but I find it helps me. When I'm hiking with my thin soled trail running shoes, I have a tendency to step and land on the front of my foot and I take quicker, smaller steps. While in heavy boots, I'm definitely a heel striker with longer strides. 

I am not a lawyer, or an expert on California knife laws. This post is based on my understanding of state laws both as written, and as summarized by other sites. This is the summary website that I used to determine what to carry here in southern California. $URL$ TWO It tries to decrypt the legal speak and identify what is exactly allowed. Based on my understanding, there is no length restrictions on folding knifes, as long as they are not considered to be a gravity knife or switchblade. The key point seems to be that there is no mechanical means of opening the blade, and that the blade has a tendency to stay close when in your pocket. Knives defined as daggers or dirks, must be open-carried and cannot be concealed but there does not seem to be any state wide law restricting size. Be warned, there are local city ordinances which are more strict than state law, and you should look at laws for the specific areas where you will be going as they will likely supersede whatever the state laws are. 

The basic idea behind this trap is to create a funnel that the fish follow into a trap that they cannot easily get out of. To build it, you simple stake off an area with small branches pushed down into the mud. The water must be able to get through, but make sure the sticks are close enough to prevent the fish from coming through. Notice in the picture that the bottom set of sticks creates a funnel that fish easily follow into the trap. Once in there, it's very difficult for fish to find the one point where they can escape the trap. 

The best way to learn would be in a class, with a professional in a controlled environment! The process is very difficult to describe in text. This is one of the best videos I have found describing and showing how to do the screw roll. $URL$ Once again, please don't attempt without some training or practice in a controlled environment with someone to assist if things go wrong! 

The primary difference is good winter camping tents are designed to stand up to and / or mitigate snow building up on top of them. Ventilation is also very important as you don't want moisture from your breathing to build up in the tent as you could wake up with your clothes wet. Winter tents will often have larger vestibules, as you will typically have more gear for winter camping than three season camping and you don't want all your gear covered with snow. A lot of winter tents will also be shorter than their three season counterparts. This is due to a lot of winter camping being done on mountains with higher winds which a lower profile helps to mitigate. 

Too much toe room is only a problem if you have too much movement in the shoe due to the size. That can cause blisters. If you have to have a bigger toe box, then a larger shoe could be a good solution along with something like a heel lock lace to help prevent excess movement of your foot in the shoe. 

A stopper knot is not a specific knot, but a technique fo preventing a rope from sliding through a loop or hole. Common knots used for a stopper knot are: Overhand knot Double overhand knot Figure-of-eight knot Stevedore knot Ashley's stopper knot 

The only advantage I see to a folding knife is its size when collapsed. I always carry a folding knife in my pocket, but when hiking I have a fixed blade strapped to my pack. I prefer to use my fixed blade for batoning, both for safety reasons, and the fact that it has a wider blade which can give you more penetration. Here is my EDC folder: 

They sell fiberglass repair kits at most boating stores which are made for this exact sort of repair. It includes a fiber glass cloth which you put over the damaged area, as well as a resin / hardening agent to hold the patch in place. Any kit you buy should have instructions for applying the patch in it. 

I like the native american fish trap (fishing weir). It's relatively easy to build if you have the right access to a stream. 

The problem with the rechargeable lighters like Zippos is they tend to evaporate their fuel quite quickly. They can make starting fires very easy, but always take a backup (or two, or three :D) method of starting a fire. They make some excellent waterproof / windproof matches these days. Combine that with a fire steel and your choice of mechanical & fuel lighter and you should be good. 

You can get a rough estimate from using an online calorie estimation website. Make sure to use one that accepts weight as a variable, and add your pack weight to your body weight. I am a large guy, and would burn over 4000 calories a day hiking for 6 hours with a pack. Most calculations aren't going to take specifics like change in elevation, or temperature. 

If you're on an extended trip away from civilization, I wouldn't recommend it anywhere except directly from a spring coming out of rock. If there are animals in the area, you can be sure they some have died, or done their business in the water and it could be contaminated. While water in the alps is likely safer that rivers or lakes in most areas, I wouldn't risk it. 

Depending on how much moisture you're talking about, it can also help to wrap some clothes together with a microfiber towel and wring them out together. The towel will draw some of the moisture out of the clothing and into itself. This won't get clothes dry, but it can substantially reduce the amount of water in clothes. I use this technique to mostly dry out my son's cotton socks (yes I know cotton is evil! But it's harder to justify hiking socks that someone will outgrow in a few months). It takes them from soaked to damp, and definitely gets more water out than simply wringing them alone. 

If you don't mind the extra weight, I would say definitely go for it. It helps to protect your tent, and $40 spent to protect a $300 to $400 item is well worth it in my experience. It reduces the chance of damaging the bottom of your tent on sticks and rocks. It is also useful, as Gonzo states, alone if you are setting up just the fly and the footprint for a quick break out of the sun. I will also add a qualification to my statement that it is worth it if you are going to be camping more than just a few times a year. Like most things, the chance of damage goes up the more frequently you use it, so if you're out every weekend, you'll be able to make use of it a lot. 

Better is often relative. I would not like having to carry a bear canister around as it is extra weight and bulk. However there are likely places where you will not have a tree suitable for hanging a bear bag, and the canister is the only way to go. It really depends on where you are going to be hiking.
