A surjective flat (equals faithfully flat) map with smooth fibres is in fact a smooth morphism, and hence induces a submersion on the underlying manifolds obtained by passing to complex points. Since the fibres are projective, it is furthermore proper (in the sense of algebraic geometry) [see the note added at the end; this is not a logical deduction from the given condition on the fibres, but nevertheless seems to be a reasonable reinterpretation of that condition], and hence proper (in the sense of topology). A theorem of Ehresmann states that any proper submersion of smooth manifolds is a fibre bundle. In particular, it is a fibration in the sense of homotopy theory, and the fibres are diffeomorphic (thus also homeomorphic, homotopic, ... ). Note: Your specific question is really about smooth morphisms (these are flat morphisms with smooth fibres, although there are other definitions too, which are equivalent under mild hypotheses on the schemes involved, and in particular, are equivalent for maps of varieties over a field). One point about the notion of flat map is that it allows one to consider cases in which the fibres over certain points degenerate, but still vary continuously (in some sense). It may well be a special feature of algebraic geometry (and closely related theories such as complex analytic geometry) that one can have such a reasonable notion, a feature related to the fact that one can work in a reasonable manner with singular spaces in algebraic geometry, because the singularities are so mild compared to what can occur in (say) differential topology. [Added: I should add that I took a slight liberty with the question, in that I interpreted the condition that the fibres are projective stronger than is literally justified, in so far as I replaced it with the condition that the map is proper. As is implicit in Chris Schommer-Pries's comment below, we can find non-proper smooth surjections whose fibres are projective varieties: e.g. if, as in his example, we consider the covering of $\mathbb P^1$ by two copies of $\mathbb A^1$ in the usual way, then the fibres consists of either one or two points (one point for $0$ and the point at $\infty$, two points for all the others), and any finite set of points is certainly a projective variety. Nevertheless, my interpretation of the question seems to have been helpful; hopefully, with the addition of this remark, it is not too misleading.] 

There are two different recursions involved here, one for the points of $E$ over ${\mathbb F}\_{p^n}$, and the other for the coefficients of the $L$-function. If we write $a_p = \alpha + \beta,$ where $\alpha\beta = p$ (so $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are the two roots of the char. poly. of Frobenius), then $$1 + p^n - E({\mathbb F}\_{p^n}) = \alpha^n + \beta^n.$$ On the other hand, the Euler factor at $p$ for the $L$-function of $E$ is $$(1 - \alpha p^{-s})^{-1}(1-\beta p^{-s})^{-1}$$ $$= (1 + \alpha p^{-s} + \alpha^2 p^{-2s} + \cdots )(1 + \beta p^{-s} + \beta^2 p^{-2s} + \cdots )$$ $$= 1 + (\alpha + \beta) p^{-s} + (\alpha^2 + \alpha\beta + \beta^2) p^{-2s} + \cdots ,$$ and so we conclude that $a_{p^n}$ (the coefficient of $p^{-ns}$ in the $L$-function) equals $$\alpha^n + \alpha^{n-1} \beta + \cdots + \alpha\beta^{n-1} + \beta^n.$$ These formulas are simply different, as soon as $n > 1.$ The recursion given in the question describes the second, and not the first. 

Under some slightly stronger hypothesis (Noetherian is certainly enough) we may write $\mathcal A$ as the union of its coherent subsheaves. If $\mathcal E$ is a coherent subsheaf, then the subalgebra of $\mathcal A$ that it generates will also be coherent, because this can be tested locally, where it then follows from your assumptions. Thus in this case, $\mathcal A$ is the union of coherent $\mathcal O_X$-algebras. I'm not sure how good a notion coherent is outside of the Noetherian context. If no-one gives an answer in the non-Noetherian context, then you might want to look at the stacks project, which discusses this kind of "coherent approximation to quasi-coherent sheaves" in some generality, if I remember correctly. 

The $L$-function attached to any cuspform is obtained by a Mellin transform, and converges on the whole complex plane. (See Ogg's book on $L$-functions and modular forms, or probably any other text.) If you just write down the Mellin transform integral, this is is not obvious: you have to use the transformation $\tau \mapsto -1/N\tau$ (where $N$ is the level) to get rid of the end-point $0$ in the Mellin transform integral (more precisely break the interval $(0,i\infty)$ into the interval $(0,i/{\sqrt{N}})$ and $(i/\sqrt{N}, i\infty)$, and then apply $\tau \mapsto -1/N\tau$ to move the first interval to $(i/\sqrt{N},i\infty)$, so that now there are no convergence issues, for any value of $s$), and use the fact that this transformation preserves the space of cuspforms. 

This is not a definitive answer to the question. It's goal is simply to establish enough background and perspective on the question to explain why I think that the answer is likely to be ``No''. The $p$-adic $L$-function does not interpolate infinitely many special values of the $L$-function of $E$. Rather, the $p$-adic $L$-function (and this is a feature of $p$-adic $L$-functions generally) interpolates critical values (in the sense of Deligne) of twisted $L$-functions of $E$. For an elliptic curve, the only critical value is $s = 1$; it is because one allows twisting that one ends up with a function, and not just a number. A little more precisely: the $p$-adic $L$-function of an elliptic curve $E$ over $\mathbb Q$ interpolates the twisted central values, i.e. the values $L(f\_{\chi},1),$ where $f$ is the weight two modular form attached to $E$ by the modularity theorem for elliptic curves, $\chi$ denotes a character of $p$-power conductor, and $f\_{\chi}$ denotes the twist of $f$ by $\chi$. (There are some extra factors to do with interpolation and so on, which I will ignore here.) More precisely again, supposing that $E$ has good ordinary reduction at $p$ (and perhaps some other technical conditions which I'll suppress) the $p$-adic $L$-function is an element of the completed group ring ${\mathbb Z}\_p[[{\mathbb Z}\_p^{\times}]]$, whose specialization under a finite order character $\chi:{\mathbb Z}\_p^{\times} \rightarrow \overline{\mathbb Q}^{\times}$ is (essentially) the algebraic part of the classical $L$-value $L(f\_{\chi},1)$. Now the complex $L$-function of $E$ determines (and is determined by) the isogeny class of $E$. The reason for this is that a consideration of the Euler product allows one to determine the traces of all Frobenius elements on the Tate modules of $E$, and hence by Faltings' theorem (the Tate conjecture) determine $E$ up to isogeny. On the other hand, the $p$-adic $L$-function does not have a corresponding Euler product, and so it is not clear (to me, at least) that it determines the $p$-adic Tate module of $E$ (and hence $E$, up to isogeny, or equivalently, the complex $L$-function of $E$). One complication (at least at a psychological level) in thinking about this question is that in Iwasawa theory one often just thinks about the ideal in ${\mathbb Z}\_p[[{\mathbb Z}\_p^{\times}]]$ that is generated by the $p$-adic $L$-function, since it is this ideal which is (according to the main conjecture) supposed to relate to the Selmer group of $E$ over the $p$-adic cyclotomic tower. And this ideal surely won't determine $E$ up to isogeny; it is much too coarse a piece of information (e.g. it could just be the unit ideal in many cases, say if $E$ has no points over ${\mathbb Q}(\zeta\_p)$ and the $p$-torsion part of Sha$(E)$ over this field is trivial (and maybe some condition on Tamagawa numbers).) The $p$-adic $L$-function carries more information than this ideal, of course; it really does know about all those special values. But it's not clear to me exactly what to do with this information. So while I'm pretty sure that the answer to your question is ``No'', I'm not sure how to actually prove it either way. 

I think that Eichler and Shimura's proof of the Ramanujan--Petersson conjecture for weight two modular forms provides an example. Recall that this conjecture is a purely analytic statement: namely that if $f$ is a weight two cuspform on some congruence subgroup of $SL_2(\mathbb Z)$, which is an eigenform for the Hecke operator $T_p$ ($p$ a prime not dividing the level of the congruence subgroup in question) with eigenvalue $\lambda_p$, then $| \lambda_p | \leq 2 p^{1/2}.$ Unfortunately, no purely analytic proof of this result is known. (Indeed, if one shifts one's focus from holomorphic modular forms to Maass forms, then the corresponding conjecture remains open.) What Eichler and Shimura realized is that, somewhat miraculously, $\lambda_p$ admits an alternative characterization in terms of counting solutions to certain congruences modulo $p$, and that estimates there due to Hasse and Weil (generalizing earlier estimates of Gauss and others) can be applied to show the desired inequality. This argument was pushed much further by Deligne, who handled the general case of weight $k$ modular forms (for which the analogous inequality is $| \lambda_p | \leq 2 p^{(k-1)/2}$), using etale cohomology of varieties in characteristic $p$ (which is something of a subtle and more technically refined analogue of the notion of a congruence mod $p$). (Ramanujan's original conjecture was for the unique cuspform of weight 12 and level 1.) The idea that there are relationships (some known, others conjectural) between automorphic forms and algebraic geometry over finite fields and number fields has now become part of the received wisdom of algebraic number theorists, and lies at the heart of the Langlands program. (And, of course, at the heart of the proof of FLT.) Thus the striking idea of Eichler and Shimura has now become a basic tenet of a whole field of mathematics. Note: Tim in his question, and in some comments, has said that he wants "first non-trivial instances" rather than difficult arguments that involve a whole range of ideas and techniques. In his comment to Terry Tao's answer regarding Perelman, he notes that long, difficult proofs might well include within them instances of such examples. Thus I am offering this example as perhaps a "first non-trivial instance" of the kind of insights that are involved in proving results like Sato--Tate, FLT, and so on. 

Since $H$ is reduced and $Y$ is smooth over $H$ (I am assuming that everything is finite type over $k$, so smooth and formally smooth are the same) we see that $Y$ is reduced. So the problem is the following: show that if $Y \subset R \times \mathbb P^n$ is open and reduced, and the projection $Y \to R$ is surjective (taking into account the remark to this effect in the comments), then $R$ is reduced. Here is the proof: Let $x$ be a point of $R$, and let $y$ be a point of $Y$ lying over $x$. Recalling that $\mathbb P^n$ is the union of $n + 1$ open subsets isomorphic to $\mathbb A^n$, we may assume that $y \in R\times \mathbb A^n$ (for an appropriate choice of one of these $n+1$ copies). The stalk $\mathcal O_{Y,y}$ is then equal to a localization of $\mathcal O_{R,x}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$. It is reduced by assumption, and so $\mathcal O_{R,x}$ is reduced. Since $x \in R$ was arbitrary, we see that $R$ is reduced. 

There are many, many consequences of the general Langlands program (which I'll interpret to mean both functoriality for automorphic forms and reciprocity between Galois representations and automorphic forms). Some of these are: 

Dear Kevin, Here are some things that you know. (1) Every non-tempered representation is a Langlands quotient of an induction of a non-tempered twist of a tempered rep'n on some Levi, and this description is canonical. (2) Every tempered rep'n is a summand of the induction of a discrete series on some Levi. (3) The discrete series for all groups were classified by Harish-Chandra. Now Langlands's correspondence is (as you wrote) completely canonical: discrete series with fixed inf. char. lie in a single packet, and the parameter is determined from the inf. char. in a precise way. All the summands of an induction of a discrete series rep'n are also declared to lie in a single packet. So all packet structure comes from steps (1) and (2). The correspondence is compatible in a standard way with twisting, and with parabolic induction. So: If we give ourselves the axioms that discrete series correspond to irred. parameters, that the correspondence is compatible with twisting, that the correspondence is compatible with parabolic induction, and that the correspondence is compatible with formation of inf. chars., then putting it all together, it seems that we can determine step 1, then 2, then 3. I don't know if this is what you would like, but it seems reasonable to me. Why no need for epsilon-factor style complications: because there are no supercuspidals, so everything reduces to discrete series, which from the point of view of packets are described by their inf. chars. In the p-adic world this is just false: all the supercuspidals are disc. series, they have nothing analogous (at least in any simple way) to an inf. char., and one has to somehow identify them --- hence epsilon factors to the rescue. [Added: A colleague pointed out to me that the claim above (and also discussed below in the exchange of comments with Victor Protsak) that the inf. char. serves to determine a discrete series L-packet is not true in general. It is true if the group $G$ is semi-simple, or if the fundamental Cartan subgroups (those which are compact mod their centre) are connected. But in general one also needs a compatible choice of central character to determine the $L$-packet. In Langlands's general description of a discrete series parameter, their are two pieces of data: $\mu$ and $\lambda_0$. The former is giving the inf. char., and the latter the central char.]
