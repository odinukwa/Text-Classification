The Rus leaders who fought for and won control of the Russian river system from the Baltic down to the Black sea may well have scoffed at Cnut's paltry empire though. 

I don't think they were particularly unusual in that regard. At the time of Andropov, all the other nations with permanent membership on UN Security Council (USA, England, France, and China) were lead by WWII-era politicians. All were WWII veterans, with the obvious exception of Margaret Thatcher. The USA wouldn't get its first post WWII-generation president for another decade. If anything, Gorbachev stepped into a situation where he was a relative youngster on the world stage. 

Actually, a good modern analogy might be to look at how white mainstream America views the Black Lives Matter movement currently1: open hostility from social conservatives, and a lot of patronizing disagreement on methods from Liberals and Moderates. Where the analogy (probably?) breaks down is that there were a great many conservatives who flat out wanted the man dead (as evidenced by later events), and that the FBI felt he was a danger to the State, and treated him accordingly. I think your best view of the attitude he had to deal with from white liberals comes from his Letter from a Birmingham Jail, which was written to address their criticisms.2 From it, we can discern the following criticisms from "Moderates" who claimed to be supportive: 

For these reasons, very few scholars still argue that the only immigration from Asia to the Americas happened over an Ice Age land bridge. 

One important thing to realize is that Australia at the time was living under a set of laws with respect to its own indigenous racial minorities that were rather similar to Jim Crow and Apartheid. (In 1968 it is said that the Australian census counted sheep, but not aborigines). So expressing any kind of support for racial equality in such a public way was not likely to be well-received by the power structure at home. Not only did Mr. Norman complain of qualifying for the next Olympics 18 times without getting invited, but he said he had a lot of trouble even finding anyone who would hire him (exactly the treatment Carlos and Smith received upon their return to the US). He ended up a gym coach for a while, and finally a butcher. They report that during this time he was invited multiple times to condemn the gesture of his fellow athletes, and consistently refused. In the 2000 Sydney Olympics, all of Australia's other past medalists were given a "lap of honor". Peter Norman, their greatest sprinter ever, wasn't even invited to attend. The US delegation was so incensed by this that they invited him to join their group. As a counterpoint to the photo above, I can't resist posting this later picture of the three, from Norman's funeral. Photo: Wayne Taylor 

According to the wikipedia entry in the question, there are some Assiniboines living in Alberta as well. After a fair bit more digging, I found that there's a closely related group that is either an isolated set of bands of Assiniboines or separate tribal group, depending on who you ask. Their languages, while still Siouxan, do not appear to be mutually-intelligable with other Assiniboines. Wikipedia has them under Nakoda (Stoney). They do in fact hail from central Alberta. 

Encoding dicoveries that weren't quite ready for prime-time like this was apparently a common technique back then. 

The exports they had access to that were of interest abroad were primarily ivory and gold. This would have been tied into the Indian Ocean trade routes of the era via the mouth of the Limpopo. Here's a map showing the Indian Ocean trade routes of the era (just before, technically). That curling river at the bottom is the Limpopo. 

However, that theory is one of many, and not a particularly favored one these days either. As of now there is no consensus on who the Huns were, or where they came from, and this is not one of the leading theories. Even Mr. McEverdy "corrected" this in the "New ..." edition of his atlases. If you look at the ones for sale today, the Huns do not appear on any map prior to 362AD, when they appear in western sources. 

The prototypical example I was thinking of when I wrote this was the Weimar Republic. (Decidedely not a developing country, but a very well-studied example of the principle). They got kind of a double-whammy at the end of WWI. The previous government under Kaiser Wilhelm had financed most of the war, acting on the assumption that reparations from the losers would pay it all back. When they lost instead, the boot was on the other foot. The new Republic that took over found itself with all that internal war debt, plus its own huge bill for reparations to the victorious allies. Germany's strategy for dealing with this was to print themselves more cash, use it to buy foriegn currency to repay the reparations, and let the ensuing inflation wither away their local debt to worthlessness. 

The government, exhitibiting all its typical eptitude, has taken to things like banning women on bicycles. 

So there was certainly nothing novel about the POTUS seal using those words. I'm not sure if I can dig up the exact history of the logic behind that design decision. However, one should note that the purpose of seals historically was document authentication. From that perspective, one could see where it might be useful to both identify that the image is in fact a seal (and not some random doodle), and who the authenticating authority is. 

Bede mentioned the month-names the Old English used for their lunisolar calendar, and they are indeed quite different. For instance, December and January were basically called "Before Yule" and "After Yule", while June and July were "before midsummer" and "after midsummer". Old English also had a name for the leap month occasionally required to realign the lunar calendar with the solar cycle. I can (and at one point did) give a lot of speculative reasons for why those names were abandoned. All we can say for sure is that the two calendar systems are a bit different (due to the use of leap-month rather than leap days), and when the English shifted to using the Julian one instead they decided to use its names as well, rather than try to map them to onto their old calendar names. However, this didn't happen everywhere. Charlemagne came up with his own month names, that survived in some places on the continent until the 15th century. Either the (likely Norman) rulers of England didn't do the same thing, or whatever they tried didn't stick. Why didn't the same thing happen with the days of the week? The only factual info I can give is that the borrowing of the concept of numbering/naming the days of the week came much earlier; around the first century. 

In 1905 there was an attempt to make an entire "colored" (iow: Native American and freed slave) state in the United States. Sadly, Congress did not go for it. Today the American Indian tribes (aka: Nations) are in fact still in existence, with their own laws and elected governments. They even occasionally have their own election contraversies. Many also have their own tribal property, with their own soverign police forces. They are immune to many state laws, which they tend to take full advantage of, by opening tax-free stores and casinos (to the extreme annoyance of the State governments). They also on occasion conduct their own foriegn policy. However, all tribal members are also USA citizens, and for the vast majority, quite proudly so. After generations of living in both societies, most tribe members today identify themselves strongly with both nations. So in general, their members don't want to be a separate nation, just their own nation within the USA. Thus it is now really socially impossible for the USA and its Indian nations to ever disentagle themselves from each other. This state of affairs is what Osage anthropoligist Jean Dennison has referred to as "Colonial Entanglement". If you are interested in what a Native American constitution would look like, Dr. Dennison's book Colonial Entanglement also has several historical Osage Constitutions displayed in their entirety in its appendices. Fascinating reading. Moving into speculative fiction, Eric Flint wrote a series of books that investigate what might have happened had the Five Civilized tribes managed to set up themselves an actual independent nation, before they got hopelessly "colonially entangled" with the USA. The first few chapters of the first one is viewable for free here. It has some interesting things to say about the difference between organizing a Nation based on self-selected tribes (as the First Nations tended to do) vs. Race (or supposed "blood"), as European societies tended to do. 

The only time "kill ratios" really matter all that much is when using attrition warfare. While important in World War I, to the best of my knowledge, this strategy was never employed in a large scale on the fronts Germany was involved in.* The Germans themselves went out of their way to avoid this kind of warfare, instead preferring fast exploitation of front breakthroughs to cut the communications (and force the surrender) of large numbers of enemy units. The Germans' basic problem was that they had less resources (in both men and material) than their opponents, so in the long run any serious losses on their side, regardless of ratios, would doom them. Russia could have afforded to operate at a deficit in losses the entire war, and still could have won, as long as they could make it up more than the Germans could. Eventually the Germans stretched themselves too thin on the Russian front, and the Russians were able to gather enough forces to start achieving their own breakthroughs. If you keep track of "ratios", perhaps things started to swing in the UN's favor at this point, but the underlying issue was that the German forces couldn't replace their losses on anywhere near the scale that the Russians could. Any changes in loss ratios you may see at that point are a symptom, not the cause. 

Back then writing systems were more difficult to master, writing and copying was very labor-intensive, and reading wasn't a particularly useful skill for a laborer. If you could do that, you wouldn't be a laborer. It would be kind of like today asking for examples of available computer operating systems written by janitors. However, since writing was relatively exceptional, we do have moderately complete lists of extant ancient Egyptian papyrus (papyri?). You could look through that and see if anything looks useful for your project. 

As a sanity check, lets compare with world population in 1000CE. Scott Manning compiled a great graph of all the various number for this. From this it appears that estimates for world population run from about 200 to 500 million, with the general consensus pegging it around 300 million. So, unless that big outlier is right, 200 million for India alone looks quite unlikely. 

Looking at what happened, it does not appear that international issues were the primary driver. When the Constitution was first being debated and voted on, there was a group of Anti-Federalists who were very suspicious of it, and in particular the way it concentrated power in the Federal government. This feeling had enough support in the country that a revision was required addressing their concerns (the Bill of Rights), before the document could placate enough of those people to get ratified. Then, in the very first administration, Washington's treasury secretary Alexander Hamilton introduced a sweeping economic program involving creating a powerful national bank, assuming the previous government's debt, and imposing tariffs to both pay that debt and promote local industry. That may not seem radical to modern eyes, but to the people who were still very wary of a strong central government, that government immediately assuming all that power was alarming. James Madison and Thomas Jefferson started holding meetings with like-minded people to help organize the opposition to this program in Congress. Hamilton reacted by starting to organize his own supporters under the "Federalist" banner, which caused Madison and Jefferson to need to further organize nationally to compete, and it sort of snowballed from there. Now to be sure there was a foreign policy dispute between the new parties. For various reasons, after the French Republic was declared the Federalists tended to be much more supportive of the English side in the subsequent wars, while the Democratic-Republicans tended to be more sympathetic to the French. However, that was not what induced the founding of the two parties. 

Grass is a plant that has evolved to help cause, and itself survive, fires. Most trees don't deal well with fire, particularly in places where there's a dry season. So even without humans, yes grass existed as a plant, and there are various biomes where it naturally takes over. This might be better understood with this graph based on temperature and annual rainfall.
