only a learned theosophist with a logically validated philosophical knowledge of the universe on one hand and a correct comprehensive understanding of the previous divinely revealed truths (i.e. doctrines of Divine religions revealed to infallible saints or prophets) can examine truthfulness of new claims of intuitive truth by the fallible men. These claims should not conflict with beliefs already established by revelations to infallible saints, and also should not contradict the logically established philosophical statements about the universe. the most challenging difficulty associated with dream or vision verification/interpretation, is the fact that many truthful visions or dreams are experienced in metaphorical, symbolic forms. For example according to Islamic traditions, Prophet Muhammad once had a dream seeing baboons climbing his throne and was wondering about its interpretation. But soon later, he received a second more clear revelation that explained the actual meaning of what was only vaguely revealed to him during the dream: that after his death his most wicked sworn enemies (Ummayads) will take over his throne. This second clarifying Divine revelation finds mention in the Quran. The merit of the latter revelation was that he actually saw Gabriel explaining to him what the first dream meant while the former was shrouded in a metaphor. 

The validity of the above statement (i.e. any manifestation of an infinite being can also belong to a finite being) can be questioned depending on one’s theory of God and His relationship to the creation. For example, if we take the theory of Unity of Existence (as advocated by Mulla Sadra), there’s in essence nothing in existence except God. That is, all that there is, all that is done trace back to the infinite God. God is the only actual actor and agent in existence. Creations are only His “beams and shades” who have no independent, separate existence of their own. So no act or perfection can be essentially attributed to the creation (i.e. finite beings). But as for observable evidences of his infinity, one can just look at the infinite and endless expressions of life on Earth; the endless unique identities of individual instances of creation. The natural universe is considered by many metaphysicians to be infinite in size. That if proven could count as evidence of God’s infinity; in their own right, the endless number of stars and galaxies in the cosmos. Also consider the endless emergence of phenomena around you. The world is in constant motion and development and at each instant unique realities come into existence, endless settings, relations and combinations of things. In the above statements, it is presumed that all supreme attributes of God find expression even in the most trivial of phenomena. An ant is as just inclusive of God's attributes as is Archangel Gabriel, however, an angel enjoys an extremely higher more intense degree of the Divine qualities. 

Ideas are immaterial for possessing attributes not found in natural phenomena. Man is born with no ideas. Therefore, the existence of a universal intellect that embodies all ideas in a simple unindividuated way that enlightens human mind upon thinking follows, as nature can't be a source of something that is of completely different substance than itself. 

To me that form of argument seems like an analogy which is also a form of logical reasoning whose validity is however not necessary, and therefore doesn't qualify as a definite argument or statement in scientific or philosophical discussions, nevertheless, as we'll see later, it can serve as a compelling subject for logical examination (scientific and/or philosophical). That's because since in science and (especially in) philosophy we are pursuing definite and certain knowledge about beings, only arguments that are logically necessary and do not entail uncertain implications are recognized as acceptable arguments. And since the strongest form of argument is deduction, they are the primary form of argument in philosophy. Additionally to ascertain that beyond the formal validity of arguments, their constituent premises (axioms) are also true all statements must be reducible to the most basic and evident truths whose validity is 100 percent certain and definite. These self-evident truths or principles include the law of identity and non-contradiction. See this article for primer discussion. Every other premise beyond them must be ultimately traced back to them via logically valid line of analysis. But if your axioms have not been directly or indirectly inferred from the first-evident principles, through a logically valid line of reasoning -- where only deduction yields 100 percent certainty -- then it means that you have simply no philosophy. In other words if your axioms are 'shaky' then it means that the entire system of statements inferred from them will be consequently shaky; a house of cards that will partially or entirely collapse once some or all of your premises are negated. Example of Applied Inductive and Deductive Reasoning Now as an example of applied deductive and inductive reasoning, let’s take your own argument and see if we can verify it through these modes of reasoning: We first form a problem: why do humans love animals? Then form a general hypothesis: Humans love things with which they have something in common. We prove it through induction: We love our spouses, our siblings, our colleagues, our fellow nationals with all of whom we have something in common. We form a second hypothesis: Humans have a lot in common with animals too. We prove it through induction: Animals are animate and have emotions, like us. Therefore it follows by deduction that: we love animals because they have a lot in common with us. The deduction as laid out in common pedagogical form: Humans love things with which they have something in common. Humans have certain things in common with animals. Therefore Humans love animals. However if any of our premises are disputed, our conclusion may be either entirely undermined or only modified. For example if we argue that: Humans do not necessarily love things with which they have something in common under certain circumstances. For example they do not love thieves so long as they want to steal from them. And they do not love predatory animals so long as they want to attack them. However as you can see the above challenges can at best only limit the implications or conditions of validity of our conclusion which can be easily sorted out by applying slight changes to our premises and conclusion. But at times they can entirely undermine the conclusion. This can be done for our example if one can completely disprove that humans love things with which they have something in common. 

A hermit from a remote land with some sense of "mystical" wisdom might say the following (humor intended :): Dichotomies that we face in life as in between desire vs virtue, happiness vs morality, individual vs collective good, — and we can go further on to include political dichotomies such as freedom vs rule of law, etc... — are all basically accidents of natural existence. In other words the principle of conflict and dichotomy is inherent in nature. So down from the microscopic level all the way to communal life of living organisms and up to the highest echelons of human politics, conflict is pervasive in nature! From this it follows that so long as one's values are confined to nature one is destined to face all sorts of dilemmas in life where one can't gain something without losing something else. Constant dissatisfaction and stress, or a not-so-better (if not worse) alternative, that is, self-deluded happiness, or even worse an arrogant life of trying to achieve maximum good at the cost of others would be the inevitable outcome! So what would be the way to freedom from this inherently dichotomic existence: the mystic would have it that it is for one to establish "an inner connection" (and stronger and stronger levels of that connection) to higher planes of existence where, quite interestingly, unity of opposites is possible! It does sound so impressive of a theory and of a promise, but as with any other start-up in the natural world, there are costs and challenges! Realizing this lofty state would itself involve, on the negative side, relinquishing certain "mundane" goods for embracing a path that leads to a superior good. On the positive side the path involves a period of spiritual exercise involving moderation of desires, meditation, prayer, supplication, moral discipline which all work towards realizing that higher existence by just striving for it and concentrating our mental energy on it! It all may seem too much indeed, but the greater obstacle is that inner voice saying that all this can't be true! But chances of certified belief can come from delving into various spiritual traditions in world major religions. My personal favorite to recommend would be Sufi tradition in Islam! 

This assumption usually strikes those who equate human intellect (soul) with human brain and reduce human brain to a machine. This is rooted in materialist philosophy that rejects human soul having an independent, incorporeal substance. Mulla Sadra, the most prominent Muslim meta-physician of the 16th-17th century, firmly established that human body in its evolutionary process is guided and perfected by a cosmic immaterial Macro-Intellect. Human soul is a substance granted by the Macro-Intellect to human body after it is sufficiently developed in the womb. But the soul works in close interaction with the body (especially the brain), however it exists independently in the spiritual realm. Consciousness and reflection stem from human soul (micro-intellect), however, with involvement of human brain (which is in fact the instrument of the intellect) as long as man has not departed natural life. Therefore, life and consciousness are in essence incorporeal qualities of the incorporeal Macro-Intellect that emanate from it, permeate the organic body, dissipating down into the constituent physical elements. Under this light, a machine in essence can never be a conscious reflective body comparable to human beings. Because for it to be conscious and reflective it has to be originated by the incorporeal intellect that governs and leads beings in the natural realm to the point of independent level of consciousness. A humanoid robot is only a combination of physical entities that work together and sensually interact with the external world based on the laws of the physical world. For them to become truly conscious they must receive incorporeal qualities from the incorporeal intellects that originate the body from its very early states of natural origination onward but that's not how a robot develops. Here's a succinct exposition of Mulla Sadra's theories on human nature, development and afterlife for those interested in this less-famous but uniquely brilliant muslim philosopher: The Soul as Barzakh:Substantial Motion and Mulla Sadra’s Theory of Human Becoming by Maria Massi Dakake. 

That's an intelligent question. Whether the argument is sound or not depends on how you read it. I my view, Descartes's argument even though maybe imperfectly articulated is a useful mental exercise if only for yielding a better understanding of our mind and our existence. I view the Cogito to be just an attempt at logically establishing what is evident to us through intuition but the argument doesn't at least explicitly address many questions that may emerge in subseqeunce which are however not really to its detriment if we note that no intuitive knowledge can be expressed in a logically sound expression maybe because human intuition doesn't work discretely as does logical thinking. Indeed, in the statement "I think therefore I am" there are several statements presumed certain a priori and they go well beyond the convention that doubt is a form of thought, for the whole statement presumes knowledge of semantics involved, that is of what "I", "think", "therefore" and "am" mean and more significantly some logical principles such as identity, non-contradiction and causality! Descartes might have had a point if he said that our intuitive, non-discursive, non-deduced self-knowledge doesn't depend on recognition of prior principles of logic but the Cogito is meant as an argument not a pointing to our intuition. Nonetheless the Kartesian doubt can be applied to each of the presumed semantics and prove right: I may doubt what all these concepts mean including "doubt" and "think", yet again I can't doubt that I'm doubting them! The point of this observation then being that regardless of how logically you argue, there are already a lot of things presumed with certainty such as a set of definitions, some basic logical and philosophical principles (e.g. identity, non-contradiction, causality), and that in our most radical acts of doubt, we are never detached from them. In fact it is because of them that we are able to think and doubt in the first place. Therefore, even though Descartes in his notion of methodic doubt claims that he applies radical doubt to any dubitable thought, he is applying his doubt on a foundation of very certain but implicit principles, and it is these certain principles that enable him to move beyond doubt in the first place. Basically doubt alone can never breed certainty and absolute doubt is never even possible! Furthermore, I find it noteworthy that, among all the prior premises and definitions presumed by our mind, existence can be argued to be the highermost assumption in each act of thinking. In the Cogito argument the existence of I and each of the concepts are presumed because even though I can doubt for example that the external world exists, but I can't doubt that the concept of "external world" exists in my mind as well as all concepts in the Cogito statement, and since all of these are subordinate to my mind I can then deduce my own existence from those perceptions. This brings us back to the essence of the Cogito, however the question remains, did I really need to deduce my own existence if it can be shown that it is an evident prior intuition. I doubt if Descartes disagreed as he seems to have been primarily concerned with refuting the radical dialectical skeptics who went out of their way to even deny the existence of self, rather than implying that intuitive recognition of self really required any argument. Therefore given the weakness of prior assumptions, the Cogito fails if is considered a logical argument based on sound premises. But nevertheless it would be a useful experiment if presented as only an intellectual pinch on radical skeptics to have them admit their own existence by starting from their own premise that absolute doubt is possible. We maybe then recognize the genius of Muslim philosophers such as the 12th century philosopher, Avicenna, who had already cited the essence of Cogito argument (centuries before Descartes) only to dismiss it as invalid based on the claim that we can never experience our thoughts separate from our existence, hence in all acts of thinking the existence of self is presumed. For Avicenna therefore existence of self was self-evident and needless of demonstration and any attempt at demonstration would be imperfect (imperfections of the Cogito being a testimony). This is also in keeping with the Muslim philosopher's concept of "knowledge by presence", their term for unmediated intuitive knowledge that is distinct from and the ground of all discursive knowledge (that is thoughts). The obvious but often mysteriously missed reason for evidence of self-existence have to be the fact that self is ontologicaly prior to thoughts as thoughts can never exist without self existing first hence no thought can be experienced prior to it. This may render the cogito argument as an argument from effect to cause, whereas the cause is already evident, even though this self-evidence is usually and mysteriously missed by the average man. Much later, the ontological precedence and yet co-existence of existence with all thoughts became the focus of Martin Heidegger. He articulated that no knowledge is prior to the sense of existence (or being) and even yet, no sense of being itself is equatable to Being (with capital B) per se as Being itself always stands above all categories. This is all too consistent with the idea of Muslim philosophers including Avicenna that self as a being is not thoughts (whereas Descartes believed that self is a substance whose whole nature consist in thoughts). Until Mulla Sadra a 17th century Muslim philosopher who brought about an entire revolution to peripatetic philosophy by arguing from logical and ontological precedence of Being as well as its indefinition and irreducibility that only being captures the true essence of God as God and Being seem to be identical in these properties! They are both omnipresent yet ineffable, undefinable and inescapable! Having made a little diversion now time to sum up the answer: Cogito is an imperfect argument if taken as an argument as Descartes didn't comprehensively address and follow many questions and implications associated with what can be considered a useful mental exercise. The greatest fruit of the exercise I believe is that it shows that all roads lead to (and at the same time come from) being!
