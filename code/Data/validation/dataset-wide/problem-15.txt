There are a good number of ways this has been done, but the one that I can see actually being most akin to what you're looking for is from an anime called "Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?", or "DanMachi" for short. Strip it of the obvious fan-service and you get an intriguing basis for an RPG-based society. Take away the "Familia" gimmick and you have something that could even be plausible with some tweaking. I will, however, elaborate here since watching an anime is a bit of a time sink. Italics will indicate the anime's gimmicky bits while bold will indicate what I came up with to replace that. This will appear in a [anime / replacement] format because I think that would be easier to read. 

Entropy can be a very abstract idea, so my answer will involve more abstraction than hard-science, forewarning. You're asking about anti-entropy, or reverse entropy, which is a huge conceptual issue because entropy itself states that things in high-energy states will naturally degrade into lower energy states, and you want the opposite. (if only very slightly) Essentially we're asking entropy to stop being entropy anymore. Entropy is broad. Technically, heavy radioactive particles decaying into lighter, more stable elements is entropy, and so is erosion. It applies to heat transfer and electrical systems. It's well defined as the freakin' Second Law of Thermodynamics. You're asking to break physics, and you know that the scientists never appreciate it very much when you do that. Without it, we're saying that instead of a rock breaking down into lower energy states, it could spontaneously assemble itself into higher energy forms. But we have examples of things that flow against entropy, don't we? This is a question I've debated with friends many times, and I always land on "Yes, life itself seems to organize energy," although I haven't been able to convince most of my friends of that yet. In fact, I would go as far as to say that Entropy is the natural selection that Evolution is fighting against, or, er working with. I'll even go out on a limb with the most radical example I can think of, take Virtual Reality theory. Everyone is still toying out the details, but I believe the one thing we can all agree on is a larger reality would be of the same fundamentals this derived reality contains. Namely: evolution, and entropy. The theory is, with unlimited time and too broad of possibilities, evolution might become stale, and the rate it could reduce its entropy would slow. So create a variety of VR's, all with slightly different (much more strict) laws of physics and all with a time limit, so that evolution might explore the specifics of reducing its entropy in certain areas. Doesn't matter if that's too far off the deep end for you, the point is: Entropy may be so fundamental it may span dimensions / realities. And to try to actually answer your question in the most elegant way I can think of: What is anti-entropy? = evolution. Er, or Life itself. Or let's just create a VR with the parameters you specified and run the simulation. :) 

I would like to add that given 25 years, until their abilities develop - putting them on the frontline or in some type of fighting position just doesn't make sense, they're too valuable. 

Carving. Take the ancient Jordanian city of Petra, for example. They put giant steps into a mountain so that they could test the quality of the rock. The benefit to building steps was so that nobody would have to hang by ropes or dangle off the mountain - during the build process. It was this technique that enabled the constructors to stand on secure ledges while they literally carved around the mountain rock. That being said, I'll assume your builders don't have hundreds of years to commit with a hammer and chisel. So you might want to pack some impressive technology. 

I notice you've already got plenty of answers about capacitors and batteries. But since we're in space, what about speed? Speed matters, and in space, speed differences can be astronomical. In the mid-60s during the ramp-up of NASA's Apollo program, there was a lot of research being done on the Moon. And a lot was still unknown: what was the surface really like? Was it rocky and hard, or was it so soft & dusty that a lander's legs would sink right in? Geologists at the time were arguing about the origin of the Moon's craters. There were two competing theories, that they were formed by meteor impacts, or that they were formed by volcanic eruptions blasting holes in the surface. Volcanists argued that when you look closely at the Moon's surface, nearly every single crater is perfectly round. In fact, it's hard to find one that's not. 

The basic premise is as follows: There exists a dungeon underground that has a will of its own and continually births out monsters that have magic stones at their heart. Adventurers kill monsters and claim these stones to sell aboveground to buy better equipment and adventure deeper, and so on. In order to be allowed entry to the dungeon, a person must [receive the blessing of a god(dess) and join their Familia / have a license obtained through having someone vouch for you, followed by an additional screening process to make sure a person isn't just going to get killed]. Adventurers have basic stats based on their overall performance, such as Strength, Agility, Endurance, etc. that increase through training and exercise. You could increase your Strength by lifting weights or hacking away at monsters, for example. Your stats are updated [by the god(dess) of your Familia using magic to update a chart on your back / by performing a number of tests for each stat that gauge the stat's numerical value (see footnote for examples of these tests)] and provided to you on a neat little sheet. Since the monsters in the dungeon apparently get stronger the further down you go (perhaps due to getting closer to the source of the dungeon's will), adventurers aren't allowed to access certain tiers of floors until their stats get to a set point. Stats have an alphabetical tier system [that is based on potential growth, I think, though it isn't explicitly stated in the show / that is used to give other people a general idea of how far that stat has progressed], while also providing an easy way to judge how soon someone can progress to lower floors (such as "You must have one C-Ranked stat to access floors 11-15"). Not sure what else to say. Hope this helped! 

So how could it be that in the chaos of space, with meteors being flung about at all different angles, that all the craters are perfectly round? There's not a single elliptical or elongated crater shape to be found. To learn more we had to study impact craters, and meteors sometimes hit Earth too. Like Meteor Crater in Arizona. Originally this was also thought to be caused by a volcanic explosion, a fair point since the San Francisco volcanic field is only about 40 miles away. However, meteorite fragments had been found around the rim and basin of the crater, and the theory was proposed that this was a real meteor impact site. This led Daniel Barringer on a business venture: a crater this size (>1km across) must be caused by an equally huge meteor filled with precious metals, right? 

I've seen many iterations of this question, though they've focused on the effects entailed. Let's pretend the earth has been ripped in half, as if some colossal force grabbed the northern and southern hemispheres and pulled them apart without leaving any scars besides the rift between the two halves. Now, let's pretend we were able to watch this unfold from the Moon (which is unaffected by the occurrence) and pause time the instant the two halves stopped moving, but before they began collapsing into spheres (in fact, let's say there's some force preventing them from doing that). Is there some way to get a 3D model of this, perhaps via some simulation or something? It definitely wouldn't be a clean split, so there would be some debris that would end up suspended. In fact, now that I think about it, I feel like I've seen a movie where a planet, moon, or asteroid was destroyed due to an explosion at the core that manifested as a shockwave along one plane, effectively splitting it in half. I could probably get the info I need from those plus some guesswork. Any insight is appreciated! 

Static electricity? I'm surprised no-one has mentioned this. How about a glove, that when touches another's skin, generates a positive and negative charge. From there, either a gas or some type of highly flammable chemical would take care of the flame. Your glove could be made out of any of the given materials: 

Containers. Simply build the island upon containers that have the ability to act has weights or floats. In other words, containers utilise valves which can either let water in, or out. When water is let in, the island sinks. When dispensed and replaced with some type of (light) gas, such as helium, the island floats. 

So in 1903 Barringer's mining company, the Standard Iron Company, purchased the land with the idea that due to ~30 tons of iron meteorite fragments laying about the basin, the meteor itself must be buried somewhere under the crater floor. Barringer spent 27 years searching, but no significant iron deposits were ever found. Where was the giant meteor? It would take several decades before science matured enough to answer. $E=mc^2$ or, the equivalence of mass and energy Einstein to the rescue! This equation may be so familiar to most people by now that it's jaw-dropping, awe-inspiring everyday significance must be lost on you. But take another moment right now to really let it soak in. This mind-bogglingly simple equation is telling us that energy and mass are equivalent. To put it another way, mass is energy. (And energy has mass. If you stretched out a rubber band, and somehow were able to weigh it like that, the rubber band would weigh more while stretched out than it would at rest.) Speed is also energy And in space with nothing to slow you down, objects can get thrown around at scary-fast speeds, right? Speeds so fast we usually measure them in km/s, or kilometers per second. So what happens when a meteor already traveling at several dozen km/s gets pulled in even faster by the Moon's gravity? It literally explodes. To put it in technical terms, the impact force is so great it breaks apart the bonds of the atoms holding the meteor together, and all that mass gets converted to energy. Take a look at the Moon's craters again. Yes, they're all perfectly round, but that's because each time an impactor hit, it exploded like TNT. The Moon is showing scars of literal bombardment. Why did Daniel Barringer never find his giant meteorite? Because we wouldn't discover until later that when a meteor hits at high speed, it hits with so much force that most of its mass vaporizes into energy. Kinetic kill weapons The irony of weapons in space is that in space everything is a weapon. If you have the capability to get up to orbital speed, or even faster, your vehicle itself is a weapon. If you could for example, approach the speed of light, your vehicle could easily destroy an entire planet. You don't need bombs or warheads, any regular matter like debris or asteroids will do. It's worth mentioning that the Chinese have already done tests like this on their own satellites. No warhead required, just a big, pointy steel rod, AKA a "kinetic kill vehicle". (Also worth noting that this test in particular did not vaporize everything, it actually scattered large pieces of debris everywhere much to the dislike of every nation with a space agency.) The rule of cool To answer your question, it doesn't really matter if capacitors explode when being shot at, because everything explodes if it's going fast enough! (As long as it has mass, i.e. a projectile, not a laser weapon) Use this to your advantage when designing, or ignore it if it's not. If this is for a game most people won't notice anyways. The reality is even tiny micro-meteorites can turn into bombs if you're traveling fast through space, leaving Moon-like craters in the hull of your ship. (You'd need auto-targeting lasers or something to handle micro-meteorites and debris while traveling fast through interstellar space.) I hope this answer was helpful and added some things you haven't considered yet. Cheers!
