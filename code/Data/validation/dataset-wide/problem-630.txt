They work really well since they cover a large area and keep the wind out of my eyes. Great for myself with my contacts. The only downside I have with these are that they will fog up when I'm sitting still, but moving clears them off. If it is at a light, not enough to be a problem, but a longer break might be a concern. I don't wear a baklava, but I do wear a toboggan hat and helmet, but still no interference. Best part is that they tend to be cheap. I bought these for less than 5 bucks at a local fair. 

Maybe. It depends on differences beyond the hitch system for the trailer. Best bet is to find the model you want to upgrade to and take measurements and compare. Typically you will find that the trailer tongue is made of plain tubing (be it square or round). I doubt that this will change much between model lines and years. What will change is probably the various bends in it to give the tire some clearance. The important part is that it is the same size tube on the inside (or really close). The hitch parts are then inserted into the tube and secured with a nut and bolt. If the inner diameter is good and the securing bolt is in the right place, make the swap. I have done such swaps on both of my trailers. My kid trailer is a Pacific Voyager 2 and the other is a generic cargo trailer (happens to be a Asom Wonderer, but other sell it as well). Both trailers had a spring that came out of the tongue into the quick release assembly which then attached to the component that is mounted on the bike. It ends up that both trailers have tubing that is the right size for the Burley systems so it was a quick swap. All I did was undo the bolt, slide out the spring, then add the flex connector and bolt. Here is a picture of the setup from my cargo trailer: 

For the upper mounts, there are brackets that clamp on the seat stay or the seat post and provide the regular braze-ons. I'm betting the p-clamps will hold more weight than the rack will, however try it well before your tour. 

My son's bike is 12 inch children bike with the John Deere tractor theme to it. Aside from the paint, this line of kids bikes have some rather beefy, large square knobby tires. As with any children's bike, the back tire needs replaced (due to rider and coaster brake). I'm having trouble sourcing these tires and the only information the side wall is given me is "Yida". Here is a amazon link to the 16 inch version of this bike which has the same kind of tires on it: $URL$ While I replaced the tires with standard off the shelf tires, I'm looking for some more information about the company and or the tire itself. 

If the issue was just the 1mm difference in the dropout, I would personally just file it out and note it in the Ebay feedback. With this one bent, contact the seller and see if there is a replacement/return option. Failing that you could try to get a shop to bend it back and bill the seller. If the seller gives you a lot of grief then take it up with Ebay right away. Whatever you do, be sure to reflect it in your ebay feedback. If using a nutted axle, it shouldn't be a safety issue but may take more effort to get the wheel on/off. 

Some local recumbent users have a different style flag on their bikes rather than the rectangle or the pennant. I couldn't find a photo online, but the flag is about a 1~1.5 meters tall, and the poll runs up the whole length of it. It is then about a half meter wide. There is very little flapping around and nothing loose to blow in faces and get tangled up. I came across them driving so I can say they make you visible. I have seen businesses use them before for advertising signs in windy locations. Here is a image from Wikipedia. It is called a vertical flag on it, the type I'm describing is 3. (image credit) 

In my case this problem is because the wheel is out of true and the axle is bent. For some reason it wasn't taking long for me to put a slight bend in the axle and so I have to adjust its orientation when installing the wheel. As a side note, I did take a file to the kickstand and gave the tire some more wiggle room. Dan's answer above really answers this question better, this answer is to document my findings and fixing it. 

I found the solution to my vibration issue. This bike has Continental Touring Plus tires on it which have a interesting multi panel construction that has radial ribs on the outside: 

Dayton, Ohio RTA in Dayton and surrounding communities have bike racks on the front of the busses. However, they only hold 2 bikes and require the rider to fold and unfold the rack as needed. However, with the Miami Valley Bike Trails and the spirit of the Wright Brothers, you don't really need RTA to get to most places. 

Why not just use a simple paper inspection tag? The kinds with the string where you just write on the tag the info you need, thread it to the tire, and done. It is easy to remove and hang on the hook while the tire/wheel is in use so that you don't loose it. 

How about a DIY route by making a tire scraper mounted to the seat stays? Use a old milk jug or some other sturdy plastic cut to fill the space between the seat stays. Put a notch (with some gap obviously) in it to slide down around the tire. Zip tie it in place and go. The milk jug plastic probably won't hold up by itself (but maybe layers or a zip tie running between the stays for a brace), but it is a starting point (or a good template). Plastic may get too brittle when cold, but you could try some cheap washable plastic plates (dollar store fine dining, not the throw away kind). Maybe those "for sale" signs (paint it or turn it around face down, don't want to get bugged). Just about any flat piece of it that will lay on the stays, and easy to shape. I thought about a metal solution but I'm not a fan of sharp edges, and it may weigh more. I'm not a metal worker so I couldn't tell you if filing would work well enough. An old license plate (with painted numbers instead of raised), some discarded duct work, cookie/popcorn gift tin (ah, they do have a purpose!). Make a note how far the wheel comes up the seat stays (mark with some painters tape), then take it off. Take some heavy paper and template it out. Shape it to lay on the stays without sticking out too far (or fit between them, your choice) and have it go past the wheel mark. Mark out the space the wheel will need. Take it to your material and cut it out, drill out some holes for zip ties, and attach. I bet it wouldn't take more than an hour to get a good enough solution. This is a close idea to what I'm thinking. Here is a photo search of the bridge between the blades of a front suspension fork. In these the tire is really close to it. Now imagine creating this and putting on the back tire. 

Be aware that there are biking clothes that don't make you look like a racer. Plain black biking shorts and a solid 1 or 2 color biking/athletic shirt isn't going to make you look out of place on your chosen steed, but you will benefit. If you don't like the looks of the tight shorts, there are baggy cargo shorts made for biking as well. My buddy does summer cross country bike tours dressed like that and he looks "normal". I commute in jeans and t-shirts myself. For longer rides, or warmer rides, I may go with some gym shorts for comfort. 

Check to see if the wheel is true and the axle is straight. I have a bike that starts to rub the kick stand when the wheel is getting out of true. The axle also has a slight bend in it so I need to check its orientation as well when reinstalling the wheel. Perhaps moving down a notch or two on the tire width would help as well. 

At first I was going to remove the pressed on one from the cone. I figured if I left them both on there then the rotating integrated one would be sliced apart from the sharp edge of the one on the cone. So what should I do in this case, or remove the one pressed on the cone? A quick look at the hubs on JoyTech's website suggest that all the ones with the rubber diaphragm do not use the metal ones on the cones. Considering this, I'm leaning to removing the ones on the cones. I just happen to have a new stock spare wheel for this bike that I'm going to use in the mean time. Here is the photo of it as a reference: 

I'm looking to freshen up a 60's Raleigh Sports that has the old standard brake blocks on it. If I able to put modern pads ($URL$ from a cantilever brake on it, as long as they physically fit the rims, will I run into issues with braking forces causing extra stress? Any issues with performance? The bike is all stock with side pull brakes and levers on it. Wheels are original steel and seem to be true (not checked in a stand). Fork, frame, and wheels are in great shape. Side note/discussion: Koolstop carries the blocks ($URL$ as well marketed for such a bike, recommended or not? 

I have a '13 Trek MT-60 for my son that uses a Shimano Tourney derauilleur with a 6 speed revo shifter. The problem he had was that the shifting with it was incrediably stiff, even for an adult. I figured it was the shifter and I replaced it with a 7 speed SRAM Gripshift Max that I pulled from my bike. It was a really easy shift for me so I figured it would be an improvement for him. However, the downshifting is still really stiff. Now I'm wondering if I need to look at the derailleur itself. Other than coating it in lube and hoping it works, is there anyway to adjust the spring tension on it? Would going to trigger shifters like basic Shimano EF-51 work for a young kid? He has a Islabike as well and has no issues working the SRAM grip shifter on it. 

My kid trailer I have had for a few years has, in the past few weeks, been noticeably harder to pull. I checked it over and I found that not only are my wheel cones are a little loose, that I can spin the axle with very little resistance. When I say little meaning I can give the quick release lever a light flick and it will spin 4 or 5 times easily with the wheel in the vertical orientation (off the trailer). I'm assuming that this is because the bearings are dry, and since anything I have rebuilt myself, the grease (park tools polylub 1000) will give some drag to keep it from free spinning. I have pulled it for hundreds (if not thousands) of miles to this point without really any problem. This summer it has been in the rain twice (~4 miles), but I noticed this new drag before. Trailer (shaped object) is a Pacific Voyager II sold through Toys-r-us (best that I can tell). I don't know the service history (assuming none) and I'm the 3rd owner. When I got it I replaced the tires on it (20" Kenda road tires) and keep the pressure high (50lbs of 55lbs max). At around the same time I also upgraded the hitch system to a standard Burley one so I no longer have the spring in the system causing tugging. 

I have a new flatbed trailer that uses a square tube tow bar instead of a round like my kid trailer has. Since I'm setup on the Burley system, I need to use a flex connector for the new trailer. I bought one of each with the trailer so I was prepared when it showed up. While looking at them either one will fit but the square tube connector has ridges which are just as round as the rest of the connector. Other than increasing the diameter of the connector, does the ridges really matter, or can I use either one on this trailer? I'm sure I get no support from Burley since both trailers are not Burley and the packaging for the connectors clearly state not to use them on other trailers. My kid trailer is a Pacific Voyager II and the new one I bought is a Aosom/Mwave/somebody "wonderer" flatbed. Flex connector for round towbar: 

Try a pipe nipple extractor or similar stripped screw extractor (Example: $URL$ It is designed to grip the inside sides of a pipe using the same turning direction that will unscrew it. It shouldn't need much depth to work and it will try to drill itself in. You may still have to drill some of the junk out, but go slow and select a bit that is smaller than the head opening. 

Probably not the best, but my bikes have a double leg kickstand that will pick one of the wheels off the ground. Then I can put it on a regular workbench or table. 

Basically, can a older (early 90's) American/SAE measured non-suspension fork take a quick release wheel? I'm looking to rebuild/restore my old Huffy Fire Mountain MTB made around 1990*. It has a non-suspension fork with a bolt on wheel. I believe that the front hub is a Wald, but I would have to look again. However, I'm going to replace the old steel wheels with some "good enough" aluminum ones with quick release axles from my LBS. I'm asking can my current fork take the new wheel or is there other considerations I need to make? 

In order to restore it, take off/disassemble the major/large parts: Fork, wheels, and cranks. Go slow here so you can put it all back together later. Give it a good degrease, wash, wax then reassemble with new grease. You don't really have to remove and tear down the hand brakes. Grease the seat post. Park tools has a good page on how those coaster brakes work: $URL$ However, all you really need is this graphic to show you how it all fits together: 

I'm going to say yes based on this photo. It looks that the hole is big enough to pass over just about any axle, quick release or nutted. I think what is throwing you off is that it comes with a quick release skewer that is longer than what is typically used for wheels. You may not need that provided skewer. Burley uses a similar one and I was able to put the hitch on a Jamis bike using the skewers that came with the bike. If your bike has the internal gear hub, it probably has anti rotation washer (special washers to keep the axle from turning). This hitch would mount to the outside of that washer. 

If you are looking at U-locks there are possibly larger ones available. Kryptonite for example has a "standard" Evolution series 4 which has a 4in x 9in shackle. Then they make variations with a short shackle: Evolution Mini-5 (3.25in x 5in) and a long shackle: Evolution series 4 LS (4in x 11in). Each will have benefits and drawbacks, and your application might require something beefier: New York Legend Chain. 

I just got a new Shimano crankset and it has this plastic ring on the "inside" of the small chainring. I'm thinking that this just some packing material. Am I right and can I toss it, or is this a real part? 

You will probably have to go with a seat post beam rack option if you want to stick with the Topeak setup (Topeak MTX is a great setup, my family uses it for commuting and shopping). This will serve you well for lighter loads, and you can move that Tourist rack to the hybrid for the more serious tasks and hauling. All the disk option of the rack does is provide a spacer so the rack will clear disk brake calipers. It will work with a none-disc bike, it would probably work better. My cables and fender stays get in the way of my rack. If you don't want to go that way then looks like you are stuck with p-clamps but I can't speak to how well (or if even) they will work on the bottom. The Tubus option does not look like a fun option to me. Every time you have a flat (and you will with a road bike) you will have to unload the rack (which isn't hard with the MTX, I have to do it with my mountain commuter setup anyways), then completely undo the skewer to get the wheel off (so much for quick release). While the wheel is off there is nothing holding the rack in place and it is flopping around. As somebody else pointed out, who knows if that will keep the eyelets in the same place while on the go.
