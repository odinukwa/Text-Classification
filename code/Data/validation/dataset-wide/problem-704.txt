Actually, those "double eyelets" should rather be called "sockets". They bridge the two horizontal walls, distributing the load, adding stability. See also Jobst's explanation here. He also states: 

You should have no issues with your proposed Shimano-Shimano setup. You may confirm this using the Shimano technical documents si.shimano.com. 

Socketed rims are still readily available. In fact, I just unwrapped one. Sockets might be impractical on very deep V-shaped rims. They would need very high sockets that probably would be not sufficiently sturdy, in particular as their material of choice seems to be stainless. 

You should most likely turn clockwise, viewed from the freehub side. If your allen (hex) key does not sufficiently fit (the small end should go in the freehub to provide enough leverage), your best bet is to get a better allen key. 

Very deep aero rims exist for one reason: To minimise drag. The difference, however, between, say, 20mm and 40mm deep rims, is not that big. So if you are concerned about drag, loosing a few spokes gives another few points in air resistance (as does using aero (blade) spokes). To phrase it differently: You would not use the (much rarer) very deep rims unless you also save on drag by using less spokes. I figure you are in fact not that concerned about drag. You did not speak highly of aesthetics either. That lets me assume you believe that deep rims are more durable. This has been discussed on this site here. My recommendation would be a good, proven, durable rim with 36 spokes (they are in fact not that expensive) and, considering your budget, have your wheels build to your liking. Edit (based on your comment): You say you want your bike to be "fast during the week" for commuting. Bear in mind, though, that the clothing you would be most likely to wear or even panniers add considerable drag as well. The weight you will be carrying further limits the effectiveness. I can still recommend not being overly focussed on drag. If you fancy deep rims, go for them. But, unless you have a particularly long and exciting way to work, I am pretty sure you would be quite hard pressed to feel a difference between box rims with 36 spokes and very deep ones with 24 spokes, commuting. Any usual number of spokes is fine to carry you (at 80kg). However, if you plan to carry loads (eg. doing groceries regularly), I would err on the safe side. 

I think the best option is to buy a digital torque wrench adapter (for example, this) and check if your wrench "clicks" when the adapter is showing the desired value. It's a bit pricey, but that's how it is, and you can use it many times. You can also send it to a specialized place that do that for you, such as this, but although I am not sure how much this costs, it should be (much more) pricier than buying the digital adapter, and you will have to do it again eventually. You can also do something like @Nik suggested, which is similar to what you can find here, but I think this is difficult to do right and worse, it's very error-prone. 

Please see my comment above. Reading the complete FAQ actually confirms my claims, as the track dropout is "horizontal AND opens at the rear", whereas your dropouts "open diagonally towards the bottom": 

Before starting, your fork looks pretty nice. Are you sure you can't send it to FOX and rebuild it? Why do you say it is ruined? About the fork size, please check the cube FAQ: 

If your bike is still under warranty, I don't think it is worth it. If it isn't, it will for sure put more stress on the frame but I don't think it will brake. This depends a lot of your weight and ride style, and keep in mind Cube says not to do it, so it is your entire responsibility. I wouldn't do it. I am pretty sure you can change your suspension between 80, 100 and 120mm of travel. Please check here. Rock Shox has really good manuals so you might even be able to do it yourself, otherwise take it to your bike shop. Changing a suspension is simple, if you have the patience and the time to learn, and you just need one or two allen tools for most of it. However, sometimes taking the bottom part of the headset from the old fork is a pain. Search on youtube for fork replacement. If you feel like it, I think you can try and if something goes wrong take it to a shop in pieces. They will figure it out :) Before buying, confirm with the seller the fork will fit the frame, specially if it is an used fork he might have shorten the part of it that goes into the headset and it's shorter size might not fit your frame or your favorite stem position. IMPORTANT: Please see @mikes comment below. 

What you describe sound like a failure by fatigue, not due to overload. What caused the bolt to fatigue and ultimately crack? It can of course be the seat geometry with heightened stress to the back - however, this force compresses the saddle post joint that contains the bolt. If the bolt is tightened, the downward forces are dealt with by the joint and do not affect the bolt at all. If it came loose, the bolt would be compressed by downward forces. This is not a big issue, bolts do not compress willingly and also tolerate compression quite well. However, incorrectly tightened, there is also play in the joint (that you heard as creaking). This causes torsional forces on every pedal stroke. Bolts do not like and do not tolerate torsional forces. They get weak and snap: Just remember this ol' bugger that had its threads firmly stuck and stripped its head while you were trying to remove it... Re-tightening the bolt was likely thtorsionale correct fix, but came late: Now the part of the bolt that was already weakened by torsion was stressed by tension. Tension is not a problem normally, this is what bolts are designed for, but this bit of stretching in the already weakened part was quite likely leading to the bolt snapping. In essence, most saddles and seat posts out there should be fine for your weight. Just make sure everything is fixed tightly. 

You actually need to be a bit careful. With most hub dynamos the case is not neutral but carries the voltage of one of the wires, sometimes the hub shell together with the axe replace one wire. A notable counterexample (with isolated hub shells) are SON hub generators. You would also like to run the generators in parallel (after rectifying). Also some hub generators might also be voltage regulated - so as not to burn your old incandescent bulbs on steep descents. 

A spoke of ideal length is such that it is flush with the head in a finished wheel. Then it engages all threads, maximising stability. However, from there you "only" have 1.5mm tolerance towards too long [for DT spokes and DT nipples, measured myself some time ago], then all the threads of the spoke is wound through the nipple and it binds, you cannot tension more. This is bad, insufficiently tensioned wheels are bound to fail. For this reason, spoke lengths are calculated with respect to the bottom of the slot in the head of the nipple, that is 1mm below to top of the head [DT standard]. So from there you get 2.5mm tolerance toward too long... if the calculator has the correct length. Try it, ask 5 different calculators and you will get 3 different answers. Too short is risky as well, but less easy to quantify. The threads in your average nipple are 4mm long, engaging just 3mm is ok, 2mm might also... That would be 1mm short of the ideal length. If you use aluminium nipples, however, 2mm will most likely not suffice. A frequent advise given is to round up to the next even number unless the difference to the lower even number is 0.5mm or less. So with 292.4 get 292mm spokes, with 292.8mm get 294mm. In essence, you will want to be pretty precise. 2mm too long might just be ok, 2mm short might be too short. Be sure to measure the ERD yourself (!) and as precise as you are able to. 

I think your best option is to change the crank. A 2015 Deore or a SLX crank are not only extremely good value for money but they also carry a lot of modern technologies (search the net for reviews, everybody loves them) comparing with your old 2002 product. A modern 2015 Deore (cheapest, entry level) works much better than a 2002 XTR because 13 years of development really make a big difference. Good luck and happy riding. 

You choose a non-trivial project. Lots of good tips have been given, but I must warn you: restoring an old bike is not a to-do list like I have seen here. It's not like maintaining a new one. There are all sorts of difficulties with old, seized components, that will be a pain to unmount, and which will require a careful evaluation before rebuilding. If you feel lost among all the information, and don't want to read an entire book, the head mechanic of park tool (famous bike tools company) did a project a while ago where he described a step-by-step project similar to yours, on restoring an old bike, with very detailed information on each step. Some of the components/difficulties he had to deal with are certainly different from yours, but his detailed instructions and videos are a really good place for you to start, you will learn a lot by watching them, and they are really easy to follow. You can find it here. Doing this should be a lot of fun with your friends and a few beers, so enjoy the process and good luck! 

As @Slovakov said, these kind of protections are never seen in XC, the main reason being that XC is a low risk activity. You usually go at slower paces and you never put yourself in situations where there is a likely chance you can loose control and have a high speed crash in a dangerous zone (as you do in downhill or freeride, for example). Of course you can fall and hurt yourself, but you can fall and hurt yourself if you are trail running, you can twist an ankle if you are playing basketball, or hurt a tendon weightlifting. You have to understand physical activity isn't without a certain degree of risk. The only reason why helmets are highly recommended is because, even in the unlikely event of having a crash, an impact in your skull can have huge consequences for yourself - much more than any other part of your body. Also, if you are concerned with your safety, it is my belief training yourself and learning to ride a bike in a technical situation is a very valuable skill. Lower your saddle, move your ass right to the back, learn to control and feel your brakes, etc. Start with easy areas and progressively advance to places which are more rocky and have more inclination. Being comfortable around these situation plays a big part in your safety. With that said, if you still want knee protection, the most lightweight I know of are POC VDP Air Knee and Elbow Pads, Dainese Trail Skins or Race Face Charge Leg Guards. Six Six One also makes pads with various densities. You will easily find all of these with a Google search. Have fun and safe riding :)
