This leaves one with the question what is the corresponding mathematical concept/theory for 1/0? The only right answer seems here is Cantors transinfinite artithmetic. Is this right, or is there a better answer? 

I think this was a motivation for some artists to create works that couldn't be commodified, for example the arte povera movement in Italy. Horkheimer does write in the Culture Industry: 

It's actually the lack of reason or logos (it's useful to note here that the title of Camus MA thesis was: Neo-Platonism and Christian Thought) that the absurd is arrived at; as Camus makes quite clear in his introduction; and he writes there that he was attempting to resolve the problem of suicide: 

This is the position of dialethism, which holds that there are such things as true contradictions; a position which is more common in Eastern philosophy than Western - for example, see Nagarjunas use of the cakaskoti however Graham Priest is a modern exponent of this, which should be carefully distinguished from his advocacy of non-classical logics, including notions of paraconsistency. 

This is a subtle & difficult problem. Take for example gravity. Is it real? we can certainly see its effects: if I let go of a plate in my hand it falls to the ground. But I cannot see it. There are three theories of gravity: 

What 'devastation' is he referring to; and is it even now ongoing? What is the nature of the 'threat'? In part this seems to be answered by: 

There are different ways of associating interpretations to intuitionistic propositional logic, one of which is to interpret it by Heyting algebras this is the analogue of the standard interpretation of classical logic by Boolean algebras. Tarski, the On the Concept of Truth in Formal Languages, argued for a properly semantic interpretation of truth, where for example the following sentence: 

The question here is when do we know when an authority is being authoritative rather than knowingly or unknowingly being misleading. Authorities are neccessary as we all cannot be authorities on all that matters to us, as individuals or as polities. Hence our relationship to authorities are as laymen. Whilst we cannot learn all of climate science - we have our own lives to pursue - we can audit the authority of authorities; and here, because we're talking about science, there are ways to go about this - and you seem to have most of them covered. For example, whilst you cannot audit the statisticians employed in Climate Science, you do know that statistics have useful ways of measuring risk, and the uncertainty in the measurement of risk. 

As James Kingsley noted in his answer Rest is a relative notion and not an absolute one. That is can only be defined by reference to an inertial frame, a frame that is not accelerating. Absolutely, the closest notion to rest is of non-acceleration. That is an object that is not accelerating will be not accelerating in any other frame; and corresponding an object that is accelerating will be accelerating in any other frame. Physically, it is the distincion between acceleration and non-acceleration that is relevant. This is noted in the definition of (relative) rest, because the very definition of an (inertial) frame is one which is not accelerating. 

How does he relate hubris to his notion of the superman. For example in the greek play Oedipus Rex, hubris directly leads to destruction. It's seen as a vice, a flaw in character. But it seems that a superman must have hubris as a virtue. How does he reconcile these two contraries, if at all. Is he consistent on it. Secondly is hubris discussed in any of the classical greek texts? I'm only familiar with this notion from reading some greek tragedies. 

Good question; it relates to the notion of judgement, which for Kant is part of aesthetics; which shows that aesthetics, when philosophically thought, isn't the conventional notion - that of art; it is of course related in some sense. Though you've asked about how the right definition is chosen in mathematics, similar questions can asked elsewhere; for example, why does a novelist choose one word over another? or an architect one material over another? the choice of artists and artisanry is deliberate; because where craftsmanship is exercised, judgements must be made; and these judgements become encoded in the tradition of that art or craft; and in this sense, overtly objective disciplines, such as physics and mathematics, as well as being a science, are also arts; that is crafts. This is Grothendiecks famous description of his approach to mathematics: 

Unfortunately the climate is not like the exact sciences such as Physics or Chemistry in where one can execute repeatable experiments under strict conditions; nor a science like biology where you have many individuals of a species - there is only one climate. Poppers theory of falsifiability doesn't really hold here. Probably one of the simplest correlatives that one can make here is with smoking. It was in 1950 that the first scientific evidence was published that showed a link between smoking and lung cancer (though one supposes there was suspicions and anecdotal evidence before that). It's taken 60 years to make it more or less socially unacceptable in the western world; to the point where the major tobacco companies were sued under a class action. One supposes that a similar trajectory will be followed by climate science. 

This is a question about the philosophy of physics. If one takes a glance at the philosophy of mathematics its easy to see that the idea of number is filled with philosophical niceties and is a much more subtil beast than practical common-sense would give it credit for. Yet, the physics literature or polemic is rife with the idea of simple physical laws. It seems to me simply by analogy that this view must be mistaken. What are the standard conceptual schemes that show that they are in fact deeply subtle? Presumably Humes critique of causality and Kants riposte by centering it in consciousness. Are mathematicians trained to develop what looks complicated to others an aesthetic that is simple - and similarly for physicists? Does Husserls phenomenology offer further clues to this subtlety? EDIT There is another way that mathematics can be simple & subtle at the same time. For example a prime number is simple enough to define, yet to say that one understands a prime number merely from its definition is to miss the point - it is how it manifests itself in many different ways that displays ones understanding of what primeness means. Another example in mathematical physics: Coordinates were introduced in Greek Antiquity as a device - it took two millenia before Descarte applied it to mathematics, and Newton picked up on it to develop the calculus. It appears thus - that coordinates are a simplifying device. However, after the invention of tensor calculus and its successful use in General Relativity by Einstein which prompted the development of smooth manifold theory - Weyl declared 'coordinates are a violence visited on nature' and in modern differential geometry the extrinsic coordinate view is banished. This is the modern expression of calculus which is intrinsic and coordinates are seen as being a vulgar (but sometimes neccessary) imposition. In post-modern differential geometry the smooth structure is made non-unique ie relative; this is accomplished by stating what possible coordinate systems are functionals are allowed. So coordinates are allowed back to allow this profound relativisation of smooth structure. In modern descriptions of geometry - algebra and geometry are seen as dual descriptions. This is reminiscent of the dual description of wave-particle duality in QM. Through this rather brief historical exegesis - one notes that the idea of coordinates is not simple, although when one looks at a map it certainly appears as though it is. 

It seems that one might ask the question: how can or does one know another, but not your own self - unless it, as Jiminez puts it, is an other. One might begin to describe what this means by asking what can I do, or think, or hope for; that is to ask what are the potentialities and actualities of what it is to be my own self. And to be my own self is not to find myself alone but to find myself in a world with many, many things and persons with their own capacities and actualities. Heidegger described Dasein as: 

Which is how, modernly, we understand we have an infinite set - which was one of the 'inputs' into Cantors theory; I mean it was thinking over and through this paradox that helped form the modern theory of the mathematical infinite. 

Given the anti-intuitive results of Quantum Mechanics, it is not surprising that Physicists would look for a deeper reason in the structure of the theory to explain what was then (and still is) startling phenomena. Von Neumann & Birkhoff pointed out that propositions about a classical physical system was encoded in its phase space. Each proposition determined a subset of this space. And the entire family of propositions describes a boolean algebra. That is we have classical propositional logic. Although Quantum Mechanics differs dramatically from classical mechanics there are broad features that correspond from Classical to Quantum - as there should be - since Quantum Mechanics should converge towards Classical Mechanics as one takes plancks constant towards zero. This is the case for phase space - there is a quantum phase space. The question then is what kind of logic does this quantum phase space support. Von Neumann & Birkhodd showed that this is non-distributive lattice, and by interpreting the join as or, and the meet as and they had a logic which they christened Quantum Logic. Its main drawbacks is that its difficult to interpret as a logic because of the failure of distributivity: 

This doesn't really answer your question in the terms given; but it might throw some light on it. Arendt wrote in her short book, The political theory of Kant: 

Logical Positivism, seems to me a philosophy that evolved by taking the scientific viewpoint as the only legitimate way to ask meaningful questions. Its greatest failing is that its not very imaginative. Its an interesting perspective to hold for a while, but to hold it exclusively feels severely limiting. Also, historically its not even true as to how science developed. Leucippus came up with the atomic theory without any hope of establishing the truth of his hypothesis until 2 millenia later. The hypothesis of a spherical Earth, established in antiquity, but not observationally verified until the first circumnavigation of the earth. 

Famously Plato banned poets from his Republic; in one dialogue he had Socrates pokes a little fun at Ion, a rhapsodist - a singer of songs - for being unable to explain his gift for a rousing emotion in his audience. Ion is actually a little afraid of Socrates questions; he wants to escape, perhaps he is thinking: stop thinking, Socrates and listen; listen to my song, and allow yourself to be carried away; then you'll understand - that just by listening naturally, one understands with no explanation ever being articulated or even found neccessary. But Socrates persists, for he is a persistent man; eventually he explains it for Ion: he says Ion, when he sings - and especially when he sings well; he is not himself, he is transported out of himself (ekstasis - out+stand) and by virtue of his art, he is able to do the same for his audience. They, the audience, when listening to his song, are reliving or anticipating a passion - the same passion; so they are brought to a kind of unity where not: 

Its language being used metaphorically; here its being used as a synonym for ideology. Grand narrative=big story. But there is a bit more to it than that. An ideology, say for example Marxism has a start point: Marxs theories, these then develop and change over time. In this sense ideology has a narrative. But there is more, by reducing their truth value to a narrative, to a story, one questions their truth, in a sense placing them of all equal value. This is where post-modernism starts. 

Human DNA contains roughly 3 Billion base-pairs. That is 1.5 Gigabytes of data. This can easily fit onto a small usb memory stick. Can something as complex as a human consciousness be derivable from such a tiny amount of data? Should one need incorporate the behaviour of the proteins? Should one incorporate the environment of the womb, and so the actual biochemistry that happens there. But this womb is of a woman. This woman has her own DNA and it appears we thus have an infinite regress. Does this mean that the attempt to rigorously describe human consciousness an infinite regress is unavoidable?
