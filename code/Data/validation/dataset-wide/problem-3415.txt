It is possible for firms to have constant marginal costs in monopolistic competition in theory. Nevertheless, they must also have fixed costs. The fixed costs prevent firms from entering in sufficient numbers such that you would have perfect competition. As to whether constant marginal costs are realistic in you scenario, that depends on what you believe about the industry in practice. That would require detailed knowledge and expertise of this specific industry, which you are unlikely to find on this site. Note, however, that just because the company has already bought the materials does not neessarily mean that these costs do not matter. For example, the company may still want to use less material per production output, because it could resell the unused materials. So the company in that case still cares about the costs associated with the use of each unit of material. It is a bit unclear in your example what this company actually produces. However, if you think the costs of producing one extra unit are the same, regardless of how many units you have already produced, then you are justified in assuming constant marginal costs. 

As you see, the substitution effect, which is represented by changes in hicksian demand, is not a part of any of these classifications you mentioned. 

I agree with the previous posters that jobs themselves are not desirable in economic theory. Nevertheless, I believe jobs can be a good thing, in cases where theory does not apply to reality. More specifically, the assertion that jobs are not desirable rests on an implicit assumption: Distribution of wealth is not a concern. Many basic economic models do not have room for natural unemployment. Arguing that wages paid to workers should not be counted as benefits, like in the Zerbe and Bellas quote, implies that workers could have found employment otherwise (which they admit). However, I do not know how realistic that assumption is today for low skilled workers. Unemployment itself, however, is not a concern, if lower labor grows the economy and we compensate the unemployed. This does not happen in reality. Nor is there the political will to do so in the future, with many countries looking to slash welfare payments and characterizing welfare recipients as parasites. It is true that we don't want jobs, but actually want goods and services. This ignores distributive issues, as we often do in basic economic theory, which is why there is a difference between what laypeople think and what theory tells us. In reality, however, distribution is extremely important and a major driver of recent political changes around the world. There is another theoretical reason we ignore distribution in many of our models. Based on the second welfare theorem, we can try to maximize total welfare, which implies minimizing jobs and then give the jobless a share of that welfare to compensate them. While the theory behind this is solid, this rarely ever happens in practice. Automation will reduce jobs, which overall is good for the economy, as the previous posters said. However, there will be winners and losers. Naturally, if the losers are not compensated (which they rarely are in practice) then losing jobs is not a Pareto improvement and therefore cannot unconditionally be supported by economic theory. The fact that those losers could be compensated in theory is of little importance to those people not being compensated in practice. 

I am looking for data sources that measure competition across countries. The variable I'm looking for could be any type of Concentration Ratio, Lerner Index, Herfindahl Index or Markup. The data does not need to be by industry for each country. It could be an "average" for each. Otherwise data for any specific industry, besides banking and finance would also be welcome. If a cross-country dataset is not available, data for U.S. states would also be appreciated. Panels are obviously preferable, but a cross-section will do as well. I'm aware that the World Bank has such data on the financial industry. I am also aware that there are some estimates of markups for several OECD countries, but the number of countries is usally is very small. Does anyone know where to find such data? 

For the central bank to keep buying a lot of government debt indefinitely, it would have to start printing money at some point. That has the usual drawbacks from pronting money such as (hyper-)inflation. 

To answer your other question of what properly defines market failure: The market fails when the socially desirable outcome is not achieved through the market. Since the market decisions are made based on cost-benefit analysis, when social (net) cost/benefit = private (net) cost/benefit then private actors in a market will make the socially optimal decision. If this deviates, they won't and hence we have a market failure. What does this market failure mean concretely? There is either not the right amount of production or not the right amount of consumption of a good, without the government intervening. For example: 

Its important to keep in mind that the exchange rate is a "price for currency" and just like any other price it is determined by supply and demand. The main question now is what determines supply and demand for currency? There are two main models that tell us how exchange rates behave based on the two main forces driving demand (and supply) for currency. One factor is trade of goods (goods market). If foreigners buy our goods they need our currency, demand our currency, higher demand c.p. leads to a higher price and the value of the domestic currency increases. Based on such considerations in the goods markets we have the model of Purchasing Power Parity (PPP). However empirically it does not always hold and in reality it is mostly expected to hold in the long run. Answer to Q1: The second main factor is the capital market and is what Investopedia is referring to. This gives rise the model of Uncovered Interest Rate Parity, called UIP (there is also a "Covered Interest Rate Parity Model"). This says that if interest rates are higher in the domestic country compared the the foreign country, then foreign investors would like to invest in our country to get the higher returns. To do so they need our currency. So they buy it (demand it) and therefore as long as supply of currency doesn't increase (the central bank printing more money) the price and value of a currency mist increase. Also note that there's no reason to expect the central bank to change supply in a floating exchange rate regime as most countries have (i.e. there is no attempt to intervene in the exchange rate to keep it fixed). Answer to Q2: It is not true that a higher interest rate should increase inflation. However increasing the interest rate can decrease inflation. Your understanding of inflation is correct. The second part of the second qoute you gave, that higher inflation decreases the value of the currency,however is correct. This is due to the first model we discussed, the PPP. The idea is that inflation makes goods more expensive and therefore our goods have less foreign demand, which leads foreigners to have less demand for our currency (they buy less of our goods so they need less of our money to buy our goods) and less demand for the currency reduces the value of the currency. Answer to Q3: I believe this follows from the general discussion above. 

To the question on whether the same classification can be achieved through the hicksian demand function: in general I believe the answer is no. To see this, relate the classifications to the Slutsky decomposition. (Changes in) Hicksian demand is related to the substitution effect from the Slutsky decomposition. Any standard textbook should provide a reference to this. There are two broad classifications: 1.Ordinary and Giffen goods: These refer to marshallian demand changes when prices change. This is what we call the Total Effect in the Slutsky decomposition. 

Under these conditions, utility and disutility are different. Otherwise, maximizing untility or minimizing disutility is the same, as you mentioned. This insight goes back to Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman.Kahneman received the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2002 for this work. A summary of the most important literature can be found for example here: $URL$ 

The trough is not a period, it is simply the lowest point. The opposite of this is a peak, i.e. the highest point. The answer you are looking for is "Expansion" or "Boom". The period in which GDP is falling is called "Recession" or "Contraction". Also note that the business cycle is typically not defined using real GDP, but rather nominal GDP. 

A risk sharing system, such as fiscal transfers. Since monetary policy can't be used, we would need fiscal policy. Fiscal transfers from unaffected areas can help with negative shocks in another region. The Eurozone has a no-bailout clause, so this condition wasn't given during the Greek crisis. However, this was de facto abandoned. This is unsurprising to those familiar with the theory of OCAs. Product Diversity (Kenen). Trade shocks, which monetary policy can help with, usually occur to certain industries and not the whole economy. If countries produce a variety of products, they will be less likely to suffer from large demand shocks. Hence, more diverse economies will face fewer trade fluctuations and see smaller increases of unemployment if shocks occur to one industry. This also reduces the need for monetary policy stabilization, since any given shock has a small impact on the overall economy. 

You are correct in thinking that greater dollar printing does not necessarily result in greater adoption of the dollar. However, that is not the point in the explanation you have read. The point there is that compared to another currency the dollar is more resistant to inflation from printing than others are, because there is more foreign demand for dollars than there is foreign demand for other currencies. More dollars only lead to inflation in the U.S. if the dollars are actually there, otherwise they may just as well not have been printed as far as the domestic market is concerned. Since the dollar is a famous reserve currency and is held in significant amounts in many other contries, the relationship between dollar printing and inflation is different compared to other currencies. A numerical example might illustrate the point: Assume 1000 units more of a domestic currency lead to a 10% increase in inflation in that country. This is true for all countries in our example. If e.g. Mexico prints 1000 pesos then all of those pesos will stay in Mexico (no foreing demand). So inflation in Mexico will be 10%. If the U.S. prints 1000 dollars, 500 of those go abroad. So the U.S. has 500 more dollars domestically. So inflation will be 5%. So if the U.S. prints 1000 units of currency inflation is 5%, but if Mexico prints 1000 units of currency, inflation is 10%. In conclusion the U.S. has a different, relationship of printing to inflation. Specifically it has less inflation, i.e. is more resistant to inflation compared to other countries. 

2.1. High labor mobility across regions. If there is a recession in one region and people can move to another one as a response, then monetary policy is less important in adjusting to the shock, as labor itself adjusts. This is a reason why countries can usually have the same currency within their whole territory. For example, people who lose their job in one U.S. state often move to another. If that wouldn't be possible, then adjusting to the recession with monetary policy would be more important. That is why the freedom of movement agreement is so important for the Euro to be sustainable. Note that wage flexibility would be required here as well. 2.2. Capital mobility. The reasons are similar as for labor mobility. If a region becomes less developed, then returns to capital there will increase. If markets are free, then capital can travel from the more prosperous region to the one hit by the shock, thereby mitigating the negative effects of the shock. Note that price flexibility must be given here for these effects to occur. 

That is basically an assumption here. Often in monopoly problems we assume constant marginal costs (i.e. a linear cost function) to keep things simple. In that case the Marginal Cost Curve is horizontal in the graph. 

If you are running an OLS regression, I would recommend to take the more volatile one. Higher volatility in the explanatory variable (interest here) reduces the standard errors of the estimator, making it more efficient and more likely to find a significant effect. 

No. In fact the opposite happens. The value of a currency (or the exchange rate) is determined by supply and demand of the currency on the currency market. If country A imports more, the supply of country A's currency will increase more, therefore losing its value. Suppose B's goods are priced in B's currency. Then, the supply of A's currency increases in your example, because it needs to sell its own currency to purchase more of B's currency to be able to buy B's goods. Therefore more of A's currency comes on the market, while more of B's is demanded. If priced in A's currency, the exporters in B will still want to have B's currency as they need it because they live in B. Then they will want to exchange the amounts of A currency obtained for B currency. Hence, in both cases on the markets for currency, demand for B's currency increases, while supply for A's currency increases, therefore reducing the value of A's currency. The currency would not (necessarily) "stockpile" however, as import tariffs in B do not influence the exchange of currency. 

The reason you have trouble with that normal graph is beacause it contradicts your premise. Therefore, you can't use it. I assume you mean the real burden (incidence) is passed on 100% to the consumers. In that case you need a graph that allows for that. Your graph implies that both share the tax to some degree. To analyze a tax passed on completely to the consumers you need adequate supply and demand functions that allow for it. As you mentioned, one possibility is a perfectly elastic supply function and a standard demand function. Another possibility is a perfectly inelastic demand function and a normal supply function. The reason both of these work is because the tax burden is carried by the less elastic side. For one side to carry the full burden we need something to be perfectly (in)elastic. You have suppliers completely avoiding the tax burden. So you need suppliers to be very elastic compared to demanders. This can be done by making suppliers themselves perfectly elastic. Alternatively you can just making demanders perfectly inelastic and then by contrast the suppliers will be the much more elastic side and not carry any of the tax burden. After you do that your tax burden area should be only one color. 

I suspect there is a small mistake in your notes. Deflation does not cause banks to increase their interest rates. However it is true that a deflationary spiral (or plain deflation for that matter) causes real interest rates to increase. These are the interest rates that matter for the economy anyway, which is why in macroeconomics we often refer to the real interest rate even if it's not explicitly stated so. The nominal interest rate, set by banks in part, is the interest rate in terms of money. It determines how much money we have to pay back for credit. The real interest rate is the rate in terms of goods and services. It determines how many goods and services we have to pay back for credit. The real interest rate is defined as: $ (1+r) = (1 + i) / (1 + \pi) $, which can be approximated by: $r = i - \pi$, where r is the real interest rate, i is the nominal interest rate set by banks and $\pi$ is the inflation rate. When we have deflation we get a negative $\pi$, which, as can be seen from the equations above, increases the real interest rate r. The smaller $\pi$ is, the bigger r gets. When $\pi$ is negative, even if we set $i$ to its lowest possible value, which is 0, the real interest paid on it will be positive. This means the amount paid back in goods and services is larger than the amount borrowed and increasingly so the bigger the deflation (smaller $\pi$) is. 

The issue is that in the macroeconomy a lot of things happen at the same time and many effects go both ways. When we talk about certain effects, we often make the "ceteris paribus" assumption, which means "all else being equal". This is to isolate each effect from all the other things going on. What you observe in equilibrium is then the interplay of all effects. Furthermore, it is important to distinguish the timing of effects, as they do not all occur simulataneously and instantaneously. So, the fisher effect you describe says that higher inflation leads to higher interest rates. The passage you cited says that lower interest rates can lead to higher inflation. However, this effect often takes some time to occur. Both these things are true. They describe different directions of effects. Of course, it follows that lower interest rates lead to higher inflation, which then increases the interest rate later on. Where the whole process of back and forth effects stops, is the equilibrium. This shows the importance of knowing what is driving the effects, because whether the "ceteris paribus" assumption applies to a certain effect depends on what is causing it. It is important to distinguish whether we are analyzing an "exogenous" shock that increased inflation or that reduced interest rates, in order to distinguish which effects are second round. Depending on what started the chain of events in the macroeconomy, you may expect different things to happen. The effects can also depend on whether we look at the economy in the short run or the long run. Some effects (like an increase in inflation) take longer to occur than others. The nominal interest rate is equal to the real interest rate plus inflation: $i = r + \pi $. Here $i$ is the nominal rate, $r$ is the real rate and $\pi$ is the inflation rate. If you lend money, there is a certain "real" return that you expect, which is $r$. However, if there is inflation, then the face value of the money you receive when you get paid back is less than what you lent, due to inflation, so you adjust for that as well. That's why inflation increases interest rates. If you lower the interest rate, then as you describe in your question, the inflation rate may increase over time.
