Background Inside the Temperley-Lieb algebra $TL_n$ (with loop value $\delta=-[2]$ and standard generators $e_1,\ldots,e_{n-1}$), the Jones-Wenzl idempotent is the unique non-zero element $f^{(n)}$ satisfying $$ f^{(n)}f^{(n)} = f^{(n)} \quad \textrm{and} \quad e_i\;f^{(n)} = 0 = f^{(n)}e_i \quad \textrm{for each } i.$$ Consider the Iwahori-Hecke algebra $\mathcal{H}_n$, $n\ge3$, normalized so that $(T_i-q)(T_i+q^{-1})=0$, where $q$ is generic. Let $\mathcal{I}$ be the two-sided cellular ideal generated by canonical basis element $$C_{121} = T_1T_2T_1-qT_1T_2-qT_2T_1+q^2T_1+q^2T_2-q^3.$$ The assignment $\mathcal{H}_n \rightarrow TL_n$ given by $T_i \mapsto e_i + q$ is a surjective $\mathbb{C}(q)$-algebra homomorphism with kernel $\mathcal{I}$. We can lift the generators $e_i$ in $TL_n$ to the Kazhdan-Lusztig elements $C_i=T_i-q \in \mathcal{H}\_n$. In fact, we have $C_{121} = C_1C_2C_1 - C_1$, hence the relation down below. Rescaling a bit, $E=-\frac{1}{[3]!}C_{121}$ is an idempotent, corresponding to the partition $(1,1,1)$. Actually, all of the primitive idempotents in $\mathcal{H}_n$ that correspond to Young diagrams with more than two rows live in the ideal $\mathcal{I}$. Now, any preimage of $f^{(n)}$ in the Hecke algebra (call it $F^{(n)}$) satisfies $$F^{(n)}F^{(n)} \equiv F^{(n)} \quad \textrm{and} \quad C_iF^{(n)} \equiv 0 \equiv F^{(n)}C_i \quad (\operatorname{mod} \mathcal{I})$$ Question 

I remember attending a talk by Barbara Jablonska at Knots in Washington (2009) in which she studied a knot in a geometric, rigid fashion. As the direction of projection varies over $S^2$, she obtained interesting surfaces by looking at the locus of a particular crossing (if memory serves). Here's an abstract of the talk, but I cannot find anything published. $URL$ 

When $n=2$, the map is an isomorphism and we have no choice. $$F^{(2)} = \frac{1}{[2]}(T_1+q^{-1}),$$ which projects onto the $q$-eigenspace for $T_1$. In other words, it is the idempotent corresponding to the partition $(2)$. 

You probably know all of this already, but here goes... Write $C'_w = T_w + \sum_{x < w} p_{x,w} T_x$ where $p_{x,w} \in u\mathbb{Z}[u]$. Now, the other basis can be defined by applying the involutive automorphism $b: \mathcal{H}_n \to \mathcal{H}_n$, given by $b(T_w)=T_w$ and $b(u)=-u^{-1}$. 

1 Many important properties of topological spaces are preserved by continuous maps (but not necessarily open maps): connectedness and compactness come to mind immediately. But more importantly, the most familiar, natural maps that we can define are continuous, but not necessarily open: polynomials $\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$. 2 Inverse image of a subgroup under a homomorphism is a subgroup. 3 There is a contravariant functor from the category Set to itself, mapping a set $X$ to its power set $\mathcal{P}(X)$ and sending the morphism $f:X \to Y$ to the inverse image $f^{-1}:\mathcal{P}(Y) \to \mathcal{P}(X)$. A "purely symmetric" function would be a symmetric relation on $X \times Y$, no? Functions are, after all, relations with an extra property that deliberately breaks the symmetry! 

In modern terms, this measures the degree of the Gauss map $\Gamma(\gamma_1,\gamma_2): S^1 \times S^1 \to S^2$. See $URL$ 

Caveat lector: This does not address your questions directly, but I think that it's interesting and somewhat relevant. The $n$th Catalan number counts the number of walks of length $2n$, beginning and ending at the origin, in the positive cone of the root lattice of type $A_1$. This counts the dimension of the invariant subspace of endomorphisms of $2n$-fold tensor power of the standard irrep $V$, relating back to Scott's answer. This phenomenon generalizes to other root systems. 

I apologize that this is vague, but I'm trying to understand a little bit of the historical context in which the zoo of quantum invariants emerged. For some reason, I have in my head the folklore: The discovery in the 80s by Jones of his new knot polynomial was a shock because people thought that the Alexander polynomial was the only knot invariant of its kind (involving a skein relation, taking values in a polynomial ring, ??). Before Jones, there were independent discoveries of invariants that each boiled down to the Alexander polynomial, possibly after some normalization. Is there any truth to this? Where is this written? 

The first section of Representation Theory by Fulton and Harris is a great introduction to representations of finite groups (about a quarter of the book, if I remember correctly). There are lots of examples and exercises. The rest of the book is devoted to Lie theory. 

Group Theory: Birdtracks, Lie's, and Exceptional Groups by Predrag Cvitanovic has a graphical way of presenting the idempotents. His book is available online here: $URL$ 

Since, $b$ commutes with the bar involution, this basis is bar invariant as well. Explicitly, $C_w = T_w + \sum_{x < w} (-1)^{\ell(w)+\ell(x)} \bar p_{x,w} T_x$. So $C_w = \bar{P}^{-1} P C'_w$ which seems hard to compute in general. 

Aaron Lauda has a nice description using the package XY-pic here. There are commands that generate pieces of knots (such as crossings in various orientations), although I prefer just using the \crv "curve" command to make splines. 

Alexander's Theorem guarantees that every oriented link is the closure of some braid. In other words, the map $$ \displaystyle \coprod\_n \mathcal B_n\longrightarrow \{\text{ oriented links }\} $$ is surjective. One algorithm (I'm actually not sure that it's Alexander's original demonstration) involves choosing a basepoint in the complement of a diagram for the link and applying Reidemeister moves until the resulting diagram winds around the point in a consistent direction, at which point the diagram is manifestly the closure of a link. 

The Euclidean ball takes up the most space in dimension 5. $V = \frac {8 \pi^2} {15} R^5 \approx 5.26\ldots R^5$ 

Gauss defined the linking number of two closed curves $\gamma_i: S^1 \to \mathbb{R}^3$ with an integral. 

Here's a recent example. $URL$ Adam McDougall constructs a "diagramless" homology theory that ends up being essentially equivalent to Khovanov homology. 

You have to introduce the language of sheaves. Then, the coefficients can be described succinctly as a locally constant sheaf. Alternatively, you can view the coefficient system as a bundle over your space $BG$ with $A$ fibers. Locally, the coefficients behave as if the $G$-action were trivial, but if one considers a loop that represents a nontrivial element of $\pi_1(BG) = G$, monodromy comes into play. 

As OP seems to be stuck, I give here the few lines needed to solve this problem as sugested in the comments. Given $$ f(\mathbf{r})=\int_{\Omega }d^2k\int_{\Omega }d^2q \cos[(\mathbf{k}-\mathbf{q})\cdot\mathbf{r}]= \frac{1}{2}\int_{\Omega }d^2ke^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}}\int_{\Omega }d^2qe^{-i\mathbf{q}\cdot\mathbf{r}} +\frac{1}{2}\int_{\Omega }d^2ke^{-i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}}\int_{\Omega }d^2qe^{i\mathbf{q}\cdot\mathbf{r}}. $$ These integrals are easily done to give $$ f(\mathbf{r})=4\frac{(1-\cos(\pi x))(1-\cos(\pi y))}{x^2y^2} $$ from which the asymptotic behavior can be readily gotten. This makes clear that the question is not appropriate here. 

This is a typical problem of special relativity. The next best choice is a constant acceleration $a$ providing $V(x)=ax$. This has the well-known solution $$x = d+ \frac{1}{a}\sqrt{1+ a^2 t^2}$$ being $d$ a constant, that is unbounded as required. 

I think your formula is not correct. The right kernel is invariant by interchanging $x$ with $y$. This symmetry must be preserved. Then, note that $$ L=-\Delta+ax^2+bx=-\Delta+a\left(x+\frac{b}{2\sqrt{a}}\right)^2-\frac{b^2}{4a} $$ and this operator is invariant for translations. This means that the kernel for $b\ne 0$ can be obtained from the kernel for $b=0$ by translation of a shift $\frac{b}{2\sqrt{a}}$ and multiplying for the overall factor $e^{\frac{b^2}{4a}t}$. Once this is observed, we can consider the kernel for $b=0$, just the argument of the exponential, to be $$ S_0(x,y;t)=\sqrt{a}\left[(x^2+y^2)\coth 2\sqrt{a}t-\frac{xy}{2\sinh 2\sqrt{a}t}\right] $$ and apply the above translation to get $$ S(x,y;t)=\sqrt{a}\left[\left(x^2+y^2+(x+y)\frac{b}{\sqrt{a}}+\frac{b^2}{4a}\right)\coth 2\sqrt{a}t\right. $$ $$ \left.-\frac{1}{2\sinh 2\sqrt{a}t}\left(xy+\frac{b}{2\sqrt{a}}(x+y)+\frac{b^2}{4a}\right)\right] $$ and this gives the right kernel $$ K(x,y;t)=\left(\frac{\sqrt{a}}{2\pi\sinh 2\sqrt{a}t}\right)^\frac{1}{2}e^{\frac{b^2}{4a}t}e^{-S(x,y;t)}. $$ 

I am currently working on stochastic processes and I have met a stumbling block in the Ito integral $$\int_{t_0}^tdt'G(t')[dW(t')]^\alpha$$ with $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}$ and $\alpha>0$. Textbooks result is given for integer $\alpha$ but not in the more general case that could not exist. Of course, also some good references are welcome. 

I have currently started a new research line aiming to prove a mapping between a 2-symbol Turing machine and the one dimensional Ising model. The connection is seen by recognizing that a set of symbols on the tape of the machine is indeed a configuration of a one-dimensional Ising model. The relevance of this connection relies on the fact that a limit on the entropy for information has been conjectured by Rolf Landauer in the '60. A mapping between a Turing machine and the Ising model can make this conjecture a theorem. My question here is what are the main references on Turing machines, probabilistic Turing machine and so on? Does it exist any standard, research level, literature to consider? Especially for probabilistic Turing machines, does it exist some result making them equivalent to a deterministic Turing machine and, in any case, there exists a theorem stating they can compute anything a deterministic Turing machine can? Thanks. 

This is a stochastic differential system of equations. I think this can help. You can also check the full syllabus of the course here with the proper references and other material to download. 

I have seen your paper. You have worked out a series with $e'\rightarrow 0$. You can do the same on the other side $e'\rightarrow\infty$. Also for this series the integrals can be evaluated. In this way, you will be able to get a satisfactory numerical evaluation of the integral for a wide range of values of $e'$. That this can be done can be easily seen by noting the asymptotic series $$ t(x)=x+\ln 2+\frac{1}{2}\ln x+\left(\frac{1}{2}\ln 2+\ln x+\frac{1}{4}\right)\frac{1}{x}+\ldots $$ that entails both logarithm and power terms. For example, for your integral you will get $$ \int\frac{t(e'^2)-t(k^2\sin^2\sigma)}{e'^2-k^2\sin^2\sigma}\frac{\sin\sigma}{2}d\sigma= -\frac{1}{2}\cos\sigma+O\left(\frac{1}{e'^2}\right) $$ and you can evaluate the higher order terms by any computer based program you prefer. 

Let us consider the sum $$ m_N(x)=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=0}^{[f(x)]N}\log\left(\frac{cN}{2}-i(2c-1)\right). $$ The first step to get an asymptotic approximation is to extract the leading term in $N$ to obtain $$ m_N(x)=[f(x)]\log N+\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=0}^{[f(x)]N}\log\left(\frac{c}{2}-\frac{i}{N}(2c-1)\right). $$ When $N$ is finite, we recognize a Riemann series and apply the average theorem. So, there exists a value of argument of the logarithm such that $$ m_N(x)=[f(x)]\log N+[f(x)]\log[z(x)]. $$ We can take $z(x)=\frac{c}{2}-t\[f(x)\](2c-1)$ being $t\in (0,1)$. Indeed, we can define a partition with $x_i=x_{i-1}+\frac{1}{\[f(x)\]N}$ and so $$ \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=0}^{[f(x)]N}\log\left(\frac{c}{2}-\frac{i}{N}(2c-1)\right)=[f(x)]\Delta x\sum_{i=0}^{[f(x)]N}\log\left(\frac{c}{2}-i\[f(x)\](2c-1)\Delta x\right) $$ being $\Delta x=\frac{1}{\[f(x)\]N}$. But this, in the given limit, is nothing else than $$ \int_{\frac{c}{2}}^{\frac{c}{2}-\[f(x)\](2c-1)}\log(z)dz<\infty $$ as it should. 

A generic linear function in $t$ as $$u(x,t)=f_1(x)t+f_2(x)$$ does the job but, for the sake of completeness, I give here the result of Mathematica that involves ${\rm erf}^{-1}$, the inverse of the error function, $$u(x,t)=f_1(x)t+f_2(x)+\int_1^tdt'\int_1^{t'}dt''e^{-{\rm erf}^{-1}\left[-\frac{2}{\pi }\left(e^{C_1t''} (x+C_2t'')^2\right)\right]-\frac{1}{2} C_1t''}.$$ 

This kind of problem can be managed using a Fourier series for $x \in (0,1)$ and writing the general solution $$ u(x,t)=\sum_{n=-\infty}^{+\infty}c_n(t)e^{i2\pi nx} $$ and $u(x,0)=\sum_{n=-\infty}^{+\infty}c_n(0)e^{i2\pi nx}$. So, consider the equation $$ \partial_tu(x,t)=D(x)\partial_{xx}u(x,t) $$ and insert the given solution into the equation. You will get a set of ODEs for the coefficients $c_n(t)$ as $$ \dot c_n(t)=\sum_{m}c_m(t)(-4\pi^2m^2)D_{nm} $$ where I have put $$ D_{nm} = \int_0^1dxD(x)e^{i2\pi(m-n)x}. $$ The problem is then reduced to a proof of existence and uniqueness of a set of ODEs making it somewhat more manageable and reducing to conditions for the matrix of the diffusion coefficient. Proof of uniqueness: Let us consider a generic matrix $D_{mn}$, we write $c_n(t)=c_n(0)e^{\lambda_nt}$ and substitute into the equations for the coefficients $c_n$. We get the eigenvalue problem $$ (D-\lambda I)\bar c=0. $$ being $D$ the matrix formed by the elements $-4\pi m^2D_{mn}$ and $\bar c$ the vector formed by the $c_n$ coefficients. Then we can state the following: Theorem: If the given eigenvalue problem has a solution with all distinct eigenvalues, this is unique given the initial condition $u(x,0)=f(x)$ that fixes the coefficients $c_n(0)$ unequivocally. This is true, provided the function $f(x)$ admits a Fourier series expansion $f(x)=\sum_nc_n(0)e^{i2\pi nx}$. This theorem does not give an existence proof. This can be obtained by perturbation theory. So, let us turn back to the set of ODEs we started from. We can rewrite them as $$ \dot c_n(t)=c_n(t)\epsilon_n+\sum_{m\ne n}c_m(t)(-4\pi^2m^2)D_{nm} $$ where I have set $\epsilon_n=-4\pi^2n^2D_{nn}$. We can rewrite this as $$ \dot b_n(t)=\sum_{m\ne n}b_m(t)e^{(\epsilon_m-\epsilon_n)t}(-4\pi^2m^2)D_{nm}. $$ Now, one has $u(x,0)=f(x)=\sum_nc_n(0)e^{i2\pi nx}$ and using $c_n(0)=b_n(0)$ one can iterate the above set of equations to get $$ b_n(t)=c_n(0)+\sum_{m\ne n}(-4\pi^2m^2)D_{nm}c_m(0)\int_0^te^{(\epsilon_m-\epsilon_n)t'}dt' $$ $$ +\sum_{m\ne n}(-4\pi^2m^2)D_{nm}\sum_{k\ne m}(-4\pi^2k^2)D_{mk}c_k(0)\int_0^tdt'e^{(\epsilon_m-\epsilon_n)t'}\int_0^{t'}dt''e^{(\epsilon_k-\epsilon_m)t''}+\ldots $$ It is worth nothing the following: 1) If this series converges then the solution exists and is unique in agreement with the theorem provided above. 2) For $t\rightarrow\infty$ this series contains polynomial terms in $t$, starting from second order, that can harm it. The point 2) shows that secular terms can be present and need to be resummed: they just give higher order corrections to the eigenvalues giving a series for them that must converge to the eigenvalue $\lambda_n$ introduced in the uniqueness theorem. When $D$ is just a constant, we recover from all this the ordinary solution of this parabolic equation as it should and all converges nicely. This means that, for any $D(x)$ a check for convergence must be performed using the above series and also that degeneracies are not present in the eigenvalue problem.
