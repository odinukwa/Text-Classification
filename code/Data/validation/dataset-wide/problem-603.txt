With Huffy bikes, it's actually more likely that you will not find a compatible pad from a 3rd-party distributor. This is unfortunate, because a nice pad by a reputable manufacturer can make a huge difference. However, it's still pretty easy to replace these. You'll need to contact Pacific Cycles. There ought to be a sticker on your bike, probably down on the lowest part of the tubes between the two pedals. This will have the 1-800 number as well as a date code. I've had to order parts for customers several times and I find their customer service surprisingly adept: simply tell them the code and what you need and they will ship out the part to you. The one time I can remember replacing pads on a Huffy, they were about $20, so it's up to you if that's worth it. Just make sure the new caliper actually comes with pads if you plan to go that route. 

Gears don't make a bike "better" or "worse." The quality of a bike is always a function of how well it suits your needs. You might be better off with a bike with 21 gears, or just 1! It all depends on how you plan on using it. The number of gears isn't always a multiple of 7, as others have pointed out. The total number of gears is the number of chainrings (big gears near the pedals) multiplied by the cogs on the rear wheel. The number is a little misleading, since there's a good amount of overlap between them, so the actual number of truly different gears will be smaller. Between bikes with many gears, and bikes with few, there are certain trade-offs and mechanical differences. I'd be happy to get into those if you'd like, but practically speaking they probably won't affect you much. Just make sure to never use the smallest cog on the front unless you're climbing a steep hill! 

You have a couple options, but both require new parts. 1) Buy a clamp-on front derailer. Currently it sounds like you have an E-type derailer that mounts between the frame and the bottom bracket cup. Your bike ought to be able to take a standard clamp-on derailer that mounts above the bottom bracket, well away from that part of the crank. 2) Replace your bottom bracket with a longer spindle. This will move the crankset outwards, hopefully clearing the derailer bracket. Of these two, the easiest and best solution is probably 1. If you want to really do this on the cheap, you could grind away those tabs - they aren't necessary for the function of the crank at all (as far as I'm aware!). 

Be mindful that despite their branding, these hubs are not meant for heavy loads; rather, it is their intention that, when stopped, the rider shifts to a low enough gear that they are spinning the bike up to speed, rather than mashing up to speed in a high gear (which is how the majority of novice cyclists destroy their knees and ruin their commutes). Here's what I think happened: you got your new bike, but the work of bedding in the cables wasn't done to completion. As a result, during your rides, your cable was "stretching" into the inside of the housing, leading to a misalignment of the gear cable. When your LBS replaced the wheel, they had to reset the cassette joint and cable, which would have improved the performance, however, if you still had break-in left on that cable, shifting problems would have returned. At any rate, there are really only three likely possibilities: 1) The cable is not aligned properly. 2) The hub internals are damaged. 3) You are using it incorrectly. The first possibility is easy to rule out. Familiarize yourself with the indicator markings on the hub cassette joint - the part of the hub that swivels around to change gears. There are two yellow marks on the underside of the hub that must align perfectly in 4th gear (for 7 and 8 speed Shimano IGHs). The markings on the bottom are easier to see than the window at the top, but require a work stand or flipping the bike upside down. If, after every episode of skipping, you check the cable and the indicator markings are lining up perfectly, then you have successfully ruled out the cable as being misaligned, which is the most common problem with these hubs. The second possibility requires no explanation. There is practically no way to positively determine that a hub is defective: you merely have to rule out the other possibilities. The third possibility is exceedingly common. Perhaps your bike shop didn't prime you for what the hub is actually capable of. Perhaps you're shifting under load (do you stop pedaling immediately before shifting, then resume your cadence only after you've shifted and confirmed the shift by feel?) Perhaps you're simply trying to put too much torque into the hub. Are you a heavy rider who likes to stay in a high gear? If so, you can expect the worst performance from your parts: learn to love low gears and learn when to coddle your parts and when it's ok to put down the watts. A few other notes: The tension of your belt is almost certainly irrelevant. However, a loose belt may correlate to skipping/grinding issues because if your wheel has slipped forward in the dropouts (or, as the case may be, your dropouts have shifted forward in the frame), that could affect the tension on the cable (it depends on how the housing is routed; if the housing stops at the cassette joint like it should, it won't have any affect; if, on the other hand, the housing stops at a frame braze-on then your wheel must be exactly in the position that lines up the indicator markings in the appropriate gear. I can clarify this if you think it may be the problem). Frames, especially steel frames, can have considerable flex in them. You can sometimes see the bike flexing down at the bottom bracket when mashing up a hill, especially on older bikes with thin tubing like Reynolds 531. We see a lot of "ghost shifting" on vintage bikes with friction shifters because the flex of the frame under heavy load physically yanks the cable. You could be simply mashing too hard and pulling the cable - even a millimeter would throw the planetary gears out of alignment and cause problems. The solution to this is to alter your riding style: shift yourself into a nice low gear when at a stop light or beginning an ascent. Gradually increase your gearing until you hit your desired speed. 

Boeshield T-9 is what WD-40 wishes it could be when it grows up. Open the brake quick release and spray it down with that stuff. If that doesn't work, a rebuild may be required - good luck! I wouldn't bother, personally, unless out of curiosity. A light rebuild is usually more successful - underneath the brifters is a tiny allen set screw. Unscrew that and push the hinge bolt through the lever and you should be able to take the whole assembly out of the hood, providing better access to the internals for lubrication purposes. 

I'm guessing it's not the Kevlar belt that's causing the issue so much as the correlation between a Kevlar belt and an overall stiff tire. One of the most important qualities of a tire is its suppleness: how easily it deforms and contours itself to the uneven surface of the road. By deforming easily, you maximize surface area and increase grip. By adding lots of layers of puncture protection, some tires become rigid and don't handle sideways load all that well. I don't necessarily recommend different tires: only you can determine whether the added puncture protection is worth taking more gradual turns. Push down hard on the outside pedal while cornering, and avoid taking turns over manhole covers, raised paint, train tracks, or any other type of road adornment, because they all can be pretty slick. 

The vast, vast majority of pedal threads are 9/16" x 20 TPI. In nearly a decade in the bike industry I am aware of zero metric-threaded pedals (amazing, considering the lack of standardization in other parts!). The taps we use at the shop cost much more than the cost of a generic replacement crank (assuming it's the non-drive side, which it usually is). 

You can use the term "posting" to describe lifting yourself off the saddle when riding over bumps/potholes. It doesn't necessarily mean standing all the way up, but rather "floating" above the saddle so that your weight is on the pedals, not the saddle. This distributes your weight a little more evenly between both wheels, which can lessen the damage to your wheels on impact. I wouldn't expect people to know this obscure term, but, regardless of the nomenclature, it is a very important skill to learn. Many people would benefit from riding more dynamically, that is, learning to shift their weight forwards and backwards, weighting and unweighting each wheel. The idea is that when your front wheel hits a pothole, you have shifted your weight as far back as possible. Then, by quickly throwing your weight forward, you can un-weight the rear wheel as it rolls over the hazard. Not only is this more comfortable for your butt and back, it puts minimal load on the wheels for the impact, which will help keep them true longer and reduces your chance of a pinch flat.
