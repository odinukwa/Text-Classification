In other words, even for Kant the freedom of reason (transcendental freedom) cannot produce something ex nihilo, but has to consider laws (and reality, which is rather hard to show in easy citations). Edit: Jo worked out a reference to clarifiy Einstein's position, so this answer in this respect in fact is kind of obsolete, but I will let it be until a better one answers the question about counterarguments. 

The first published translation was to Dutch in 1675 According to the very recent paper Dijkstra, T. & Weststeijn, T., (2017). Constructing Confucius in the Low Countries. De Zeventiende Eeuw. Cultuur in de Nederlanden in interdisciplinair perspectief. 32(2), pp.137–164. (Available online here), it was not a Latin translation that has been the first one published: 

Long story short: If my willing is dependent on willing the outcome, my willing will only be so if I have an incentive to achieve the desired effect. This means it cannot serve as objective (formal) principle, but is necessarily material and therefore subjective. Step 5* (if you do not read carefully): Rational beings are our best guess for objective ends and if there is such a thing, it's them. 

Helmuth Plessner in his Die Stufen des Organischen und der Mensch. Einführung in die Philosophische Anthropologie from 1928 (!) [The Levels of the Organic and Man, Introduction to Philosophical Anthropology (unpublished as english translation).] proposes a philosophy of nature where the basic category of life (in phenomenological terms) is transcending its own borders from within and outside-in, and therefore having its border. This is thought to be the basic destinguishing feature of life: Non-living nature does not have its border as part of its own (membranes, skin, etc). For 'dead things', the border is simply the nothing between two different mediums, not belonging to either of them. Living beings, as having their border, posit themselves within an environment, they have a 'positionality'. The notion of border is summarised in Krüger, Hans-Peter (2007): 'The Second Nature of Human Beings: An Invitation for John McDowell to discuss Helmuth Plessner’s Philosophical Anthropology', Philosophical Explorations 1:2, pp. 107–119 as follows: 

His argument has five steps on the way to objectivity (why moral principles have to be ojective for Kant is a different question): Step 1: Only rational beings have a will. 

This endorses the point about being "in force all the time hypothetically": It is always correct, but as long as you do not actually want to achieve the end, it is merely technical (it gives you means to a specific end), if you do, it becomes assertorical (in force without further ado). 

Considering all this together, you will therefore necessarily end up with something like "your maxims should have the form of a law, i.e. be universalisable as a universal law". The exact formulations may differ, but this is the essential proposition that will constitute an imperative as categorical. And this is why for him, there can only be ONE categorical imperative, although there certainly can be loads of different formulations. 

Diesseitigkeit is an adjectivation of the noun Diesseits (translation: this world), Jenseitigkeit accordingly of Jenseits (translation: the other world). As another possible direction, the Historisch-kritisches Wörterbuch des Marxismus [Historic-Critical Dictionary of Marxism](German, found here) states regarding the actual relation to Feuerbach that Marx' criticism is aiming primarily at Wesen des Christentums [The Essence of Christianity] and thesis two is about the concept of Gattung [Category?!, not sure] there. But as I'm not into Feuerbach, I cannot give any more specification on that. Conclusion I actually think with Cyril Smith that his materialism is here to be thought as a statement against the priority of thought in dualism and idialism (and, taking the answer of @KentaroTotomo, Feuerbach's wannabe materialism), but would add that as Feuerbach wrote about Christianity, also against the priority of afterlife in there: Thought and truth are not "of another world" and there are no things in themselves, therefore the truth (and good!) can be proven (and have to be!) in practice, that means in a change of this world. This is coherent to the general line of attack in his Theses. Hence, Diesseitigkeit has nothing to do with capitalism. 

Obviously, it is taken from the SEP entry about perfect goodness. In the fourth part, which I directly linked to, the big question is wether there actually is the Leibnizian "best of all possible worlds" as actual (and therefore a morally perfect God) possible. The very challenge that is made in the first paragraphs is that moral goodness may very well only be comparative. That does exactly mean that there is no such thing as an absolute standard of moral goodness. And without this absolute standard, the very idea of a "best of all possible worlds" loses its meaning. God could always perform an comparatively better act, i.e. create a better world, because otherwise, the goodness would be absolute, which it per definitionem is not. The next paragraph that contains the argumentation you presented now consequently does not try to argue that it in fact is the case. It is just that: 

The shortest answer I can think of is a short text from the Conclusion of the Critique of Practical Reason: 

Regarding the actual judgement and its philosophical background The constitutional court in fact had three main points in its justification of the judgement: 

Hellmuth Plessner did write about nationalism in his books The Limits of Community. A. Critique of Social Radicalism, transl. and introd. by Andrew Wallace, Humanity Books, New York: Prometheus Books 1999. and (only German): Die verspätete Nation (1959/1934) There, the main difference between Germany and the European "nations" is that Germany lacked a common revolutionary history and therefore a legend or myth of its ascendence. Nations would have their myth or legend (coming from shared historical events) and the society (as in difference to community) has its common ground there, supported by a shared religion (culture, ethos, etc.). Both constitute a specific ideological and cultural identification with their country and "people". He argues that it is because Germany lacks this factually, that even if people are patriotic (i.e. emotionally involved about their country), there is no common ground as in nations. "The people" is divided by borders, there is not even remotely something like religious homogeneity, and no myth of creation (history is regionally fractured and growing together happened rather gradually than in times of great despair with a bang). All this makes a broad nationalistic identification (which is indeed ideological, as Joseph pointed out, but also cultural) impossible. Interesting aside: Plessner foretold that because of this, Germany can only open itself to a European society, or try to fall back into forms of community, which are too limited for whole societies and therefore mean cultural and ideological hegemony. These forms, he wrote, are either communism or fascism, and both are agressive against anyone that does not share their ideology. And it was indeed fascism that created a myth of nationalism to make up for what Germany factually never had. Disclaimer: I would cite if I could, but these are thoughts that evolve over several pages in two different books and are virtually impossible to nail down to specific text passages. 

One aspect is that of "problematical" judgements, which could be understood as "may be"-judgements (see e.g. GMM, 4:414-5). The other one is that he seems to claim here that every knowledge has to be derived with certainty from a priori principles, which, albeit "resting on empirical grounds", remain a priori (see Prol., Ak. 4:373-4,fn.). Alltogether there are some similarities, but I would say the kantian concept of knowledge is more restrictive. Edit as I stumbled across it: In his Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Sciences Kant restates this strict sense of knowledge, saying that knowledge [Wissen] that is founded in empirical findings is not to be called knowledge [Wissen] in a strict sense (Ak. 468). He destinguishes once more between knowledge [Erkenntnis], that is apodictically certain and systematically gained by principles a priori, and experience [Erfahrung] that is founded by empirical facts and/or gained through empirical principles. What is therefore needed for knowledge is the "construction of the concept" (any hegelians knowing this? now you know how strong Kant's influence was!) through schematism, i.e. especially pointing out the connection between a priori and intuition in order to proof the objective reality of the concept. Förster describes this in his chapter on the Foundations, reflecting on the preface. 

The objective principle (after which the subject ought to act by virtue of being rational) may therefore become the subjective principle of a given subject simply by the subject itself, in choosing it as its principle of acting. It is objective as it is a rational insight that it has to be a (read: general/universal) principle of the will (of all finite rational beings), no matter if the subjective (read: particular) will chooses it or not. Subjective principle in the third critique 

Combining the aspects, we already know that if there is a free will and therefore morality, it has to act according to a law that is independent of the laws of nature. Second step: Imperatives Again, this is straightforwardly imposed by definitions: 

This one is a bit tricky. He does not really present an argument why we should be ends in ourselves. Step 5 (Kant explained): Because we realise that we and all other rational beings are setting ends and have lawgiving will, we see that we all - by virtue of setting ends and being able to do so rationally - are ends in ourselves. He writes: 

As you can see, both simply meant ‘customs’, or (social) ‘habits’. Therefore, there are good reasons to state in the introduction to Copp, David (Ed.) (2007). The Oxford Handbook of Ethical Theory. Oxford: Oxford University Press.: 

Although only teaching is mentioned as bounded by allegiance to the constitution, the systematics of the Grundgesetz make clear that all these rights find their boundings in the first four articles if they collide. They can be found in english on this site. Therefore, scholars and especially university professors (teachers and public officials) can of course be charged e.g. for denying holocaust, because they violate higher valued rights (i.e. human dignity, art.1 no. 1 and the moral law, art. 2 no. 1). The reason for explicitly mentioning arts and sciences is for creating rights of their own that cannot be constrained in any way by general law or any other governmental action, unlike freedom of speech (see article 5 nos. 1 and 2). That means the only way to constrain these rights (but by higher valued rights, see above) is making a new constitution! In this sense, the freedom of speech is extended (less restricted) for arts and sciences (as well as press in a wide understanding as "media", see Art. 5 I, sentence 3: "There shall be no censorship"), because they are more violative to governmental actions as they are supposed to express the whole range of opinions in public, even if the government may not like it. Regarding extensions of freedom of speech In a general understanding, any extension (or stronger restriction) of freedom of speech seems injust, because it contradicts any sense of equality. On the other hand, explicitely protecting public institutions like media, arts and scientific institutions seems inevatible. Look at e.g. Turkey (or Russia) what happens if you do not. So as you can see, you should never equate equality with justice/fairness per se. In fact inequality has to happen if it proves to be better for society. In philosophy, this is manifested in e.g. Rawls' Second principle from Justice as Fairness. P.S. Sorry if this answer is too technical and less philosophical than it could be, I studied german law for two years in Germany and misunderstandings like these are still taken personally ;) 

the transcendental aesthetics are about the conditions of the possibility of our reference to objects insofar they have corresponding intuitions (the forms of intuition, space and time, are the answer), the transcendental analytic about the conditions of the possibility of our reference to objects insofar they are represented as objects at all (the categories of pure understanding), and the transcendental dialectics (not mentioned here) about the conditions of the possibility of our reference to objects that do not have a corresponding intuition and are nevertheless necessary (the ideas of pure reason, whose relation to their objects is inexplicable). 

I suggest Paul, L.A. (2009): Counterfactual Theories, In: Helen Beebee, Christopher Hitchcock, and Peter Menzies (eds.), The Oxford Handbook of Causation, Oxford: Oxford UP, Ch. 8. This is a good and quite easy-to-read introduction that is particularly addressed to students getting familiar with the theories of causation. It also offers a lot of material for further studies and is usually available through the universities' libraries, at least as an online version. From the introduction: 

Dogmatism, Hegel argues, essentially means taking the third option in stating something finite/relative as absolute, i.e. stating something as an absolute truth that in fact is (logically consistent) open to objection: 

Plesssner secures this (and the other categries he establishes for each level of the organic) by appling the methods of phenomenology, hermeneutics and transcendental philosophy all together, including the contemporary state of the art biologists' empirical experiments, and by this methodologically avoiding the anthropologic circle, i.e. defining categories and insight only on the basis of the specifically human (see Foucault's episteme of the modern times, but written decades earlier). To apply your example of Lem's: With communicating, reacting to the environment and probably even having self-consciousness, the ocean would possibly even qualify for the highest level, under the name of (but explicitely not excluding other life-forms and species) the human. 

In other words: Tomasello is careful in excluding egoistic motivation for the behaviour. This shows that egoism is indeed not a psychological fact, but, if anything, a culturally learned behaviour. 

A good start would be Habermas' Theory of Communicative Action. It is very complex and hard to get into for a beginner and even advanced students without guidance, though. But I think every contempory theory regarding social concensus has to deal with the theoretical framework established and defended by Habermas. For an introduction, see this Wikipedia entry 

So you can be pretty sure that it is formatted just as Kant himself has intended it, because A and B edition have been revised by him personally. I do not have found any kind of source for his influence on the formatting in the books, but as the appearance stayed the same after many reviews of his A edition and his own revision resulting in the B edition, this is a strong evidence for the assumption. That is why most editions mark the change of the pagenumber in A respectively B edition. The main problem is that most editions (of CPR) write the text that is not identical in both editions (A and B) in italic instead of letting the whole textbody of B edition follow the whole not identical parts of the A edition. Therefore it sometimes is easier to go with the Akademie-Ausgabe (respectively Cambridge Edition), where they are seperated in different Volumes: B Edition Volume III (including the completely identical text A406-856), A Edition Volume IV p. 1-238 (only including pages AI-A405).
