Well, any element (or, indeed, any molecule) will emit a characteristic pattern of spectral lines when heated, so colored flames are pretty easy to do. Sodium, for instance, gives a bright orange flame, as seen on the left side of this page. Colored smoke is more difficult, since the same reactions responsible for combustion also tend to destroy organic pigments. However, this Wikipedia page lists several pigments that are heat-stable enough to work. Most of them are at least somewhat toxic, but Disperse Red 9, Disperse Red 11, Solvent Red 27, Solvent Yellow 16, Solvent Yellow 56, Solvent Blue 35, Solvent Blue 36, Solvent Blue 5, and Solvent Violet 13 are not (or, at least, their Wikipedia pages say nothing about toxicity). So if you want to have a plant that burns with colored smoke, those are probably your best bets. Also note that compounds that are already fully oxidized can't be oxidized further. Most metal oxides, however, have fairly dull colors. Iron (III) oxide, for instance, is kind of a reddish brown (rust-colored... because it's rust). However, in order for a material to have visibly rust-colored smoke, whatever's burning must have quite a lot of iron in it, which isn't likely to happen in an organic plant. In any case, here's Wikipedia's list of inorganic pigments, if you need more inspiration. Just stay away from the ones with toxic heavy metals. 

I have this guy (lets call him Mike), that can instantly teleport anywhere in the universe with little effort (yes, even inside solid walls and such). He also happens to be very very dangerous, and needs to be contained (he is immortal). One of the few things that can stop him is a forcefield, that works like this: 

Certain galactic trade union (the Blue) has a base on a distant planet, where they mine extremely rare unobtanium. They have set up anti-spacecraft cannons and essentially turned the planet into an impregnable fortress. Everything in range except Blue cargo ships gets pulverized. Their competitors (the Red) want to get their hands on the unobtanium and decide to put the planet under blockade (or siege, don't know which word is better). For that purpose, they build a megastructure around the planet, which works like this: 

They have in common that magic, as a craft, is mainly an act of will, instead of a life-agnostic matter of fact. You can take these alternatives: 

Not only different cultures and species but also different, independent, worlds. Separated by many light years apart. With different concept of times (planetary orbits). Different concept of primitive elements, perhaps. 

Magic is a threat to any current legal system. The reasoning regarding these legal systems assume things like, say, the word of experts (experienced / proficient professionals who act as the voice on matter for the judges). Magical procedures should be accepted since otherwise they could taint the entire process leading to an evidence dismissal as being a fruit of poisonous tree (think the hard it is to make a court accept DNA proofs and hidden recording proofs). For stuff like a murder, you need more than just an illusions test (the defendant claims to been under an illusion and picks a knife which he never used). You must check: 

Yes. In order to have perpetual twilight, the Sun must constantly appear to be on or near the horizon from at least some point on the planet's surface. One way to to this is for the planet to not not rotate relative to its star- that is, for it to be tidally locked. Another is for the planet to have zero axial tilt. If a planet has zero axial tilt, it'll have normal days and nights over most of its surface, but perpetual twilight at the poles. I propose that your planet has zero axial tilt and is at or just inside the inner edge of its sun's habitable zone. Most of the surface is far too hot for humans to colonize comfortably; but at the poles, it's just cool enough. A "day", for your colonists, will be the amount of time it takes for the Sun to complete one circuit all the way around the horizon. Your colonists may construct a clock based on the length of this "day" (perhaps by defining "midnight" to be "when the Sun goes behind that mountain in the distance and casts a shadow over the colony for a few minutes"), or they may eschew locally-derived timekeeping entirely and use 24-hour clocks from Earth. If I'm not mistaken, the Sun would actually appear to be above the horizon 24/7 at the poles of such a planet, due to how the atmosphere refracts light, so this would technically be more of a perpetual sunset than perpetual twilight. That said, a perpetual sunset may well be close enough to twilight for your purposes. After all, on a tidally locked planets, the inhabited portions are typically on the sunlit side. It's hard to grow crops or power solar panels on the dark side. 

Think about this: Quichua language expanded for 500 years among different regions, and was intended to be the same and unify the whole Tawantinsuyu (South American region involving Ecuador, Peru, South of Colombia, Bolivia, and north of Argentina). In 500 years and a strict effort to have it unified, we can distinguish right now at least 9 distinct dialects. In a small region. In a relatively small period. With a unified and controlled effort to adapt civilization to use that language (first by Pachacuteq and his heirs, and then by Spanish conquerors). What do you expect involving... 

Magic refers to the knowledge and practices held by magus, which could be thought as priests or people with high knowledge in the subject. So the word magic in its pure form refers to craft of the wise (wo)men. You have two different approaches to that word, apart from the trickery meaning (illusionism, which anyway is quite related to one of the concepts): 

I have this shapeshifting alien living on earth posing as human. He does not follow any "alien agenda", just trying to blend in to ensure his survival. He has a wife, children, stable job etc. Never does anything unhuman-like. Now he is about to be exposed. How could humans (preferably his own wife) possibly find out about him? Important thing is, he knows this is about to happen before it actually happens, but he is powerless - or maybe not motivated enough - to do anything about it. Could be some mistake he made that is too late to fix. Here is some more information that might help: 

So basically, a guy (criminal, fraud, con artist and generally very untrustworhy person) is involved in an accident and suffers total memory loss. He remembers absolutely nothing about his previous life. Naturally, he gets captured almost immediately and interrogation ensues. Of course, everybody thinks he is just trying to pull some stunt and do not believe a word he says. How could this guy possibly prove (or at least convince those people), he really lost his memory? Notes: 

And questions like that. For that to work, experts should develop metamagic skills (spells that may affect or guess stuff about other spells, in the same way that meta.SE sites discuss about the corresponding SE site; your magic world should support some stuff like this in order to have at least a draft of a legal system). And then we fall into a Petitio Principii: Does metamagic affect itself? Is there a last-word metamagic spell which could unveil the truth about the execution of a metamagic spell (or regular spell) and not be countered/altered anyhow? Magic is the ability to change the reality somehow. Even if you limit your magic to just violate thermodynamics, it's enough to develop science breaking laws of space and time (e.g. teleport) and would screw your proof system. Even with metamagic, you find yourself in a world where everyone is potentially self-sufficient in power (or at least those who can handle the power). Think about bitcoins. They are a coin generated by the network itself, with a kind of algorithm (programming could be seen as magic if some laws are respected) belonging to a scheme called Byzantine Fault Tolerance. The same would occur to the magic: the most people uses metamagic to freeze or recover the actually occurred facts (at least 51% of magical skills in the whole world), the most accurate will be the rules. Bitcoin nodes/servers are the wizards here, which process the transactions and maintain the encrypted wallets. But being that a judge should correlate evidences -by logical reasoning- with facts by stating time, space, and matter being inmutable... What's the relevance of a trial as we state now when those three aspects of reality itself can be mangled? E.g. how would you implement a magic-aware legal system in a country with conflicts like Venezuela? (currently 66%+ people opposes the government and the overall system). Summary: If the legal system -our current, Roman-based, legal systems- is flawed as it is now many times, and if an evidence corruption can flaw an entire case... How would this system be relevant/accurate when the reality itself is/was/will be mangled? Usually facts... happened. How would you trust any legal system if you can even make (with a combination of magic and our current science status) facts unhappen? There would be no fixed reality to judge. 

There are two tools at your disposal, as a science-based worldbuilder, that can provide answers to questions like this one. They are Special Relativity and General Relativity. Your question reminds me of the classic Twin Paradox. In this paradox, one member of a pair of identical twins takes a trip on a rocket at near the speed of light, while the other stays at home on Earth. When the traveler returns, they will have aged less than their stay-at-home sibling. If you replace the rocket with your unusual planet and just kind of have it accelerate around the galaxy (by attaching it to a big rocket or something), you could arrange it so that 10 days there take the same amount of time as 40 years here. That's exactly the opposite of what you're going for. Since that didn't work, let's try placing your planet in orbit around a large black hole. Gravitational time dilation causes time to pass more slowly the deeper you are in a gravitational well. As an example, the Earth's core is about 2.5 years younger than its surface. This is, once again, exactly the opposite of what you're going for. You could solve this by attaching Earth to a big rocket or putting Earth in orbit around a large black hole, but that doesn't exactly answer the spirit of your question. So here's what I propose: It's not relativistic weirdness that's causing time on your planet to behave weirdly; it's the planet's portal. Maybe these portals have built-in clocks that keep them synchronized, so that one hour on any planet is one hour on any other. Perhaps whoever built the portals added this feature to counteract the effects of gravitational time dilation on planets orbiting large black holes. In any case, the clock in this planet's portal is damaged, and is running some 1460 times slower than it should. As a result, if you come to Earth from this planet, stay for ten days, and then go back there, you'll arrive once the portal thinks ten days have passed... but since the portal's clock is running slow, you will actually have been gone for forty years. This solution does horribly violate causality, but so does literally any form of faster-than-light transportation. You've already completely broken physics; this doesn't break it any more. 

Was the user under the effects of Imperio? (This was a claimed defense in Harry Potter's canon). If the suspected does not remember anything, consider also he being under effects of obliviate. Was the matter/space correspondence altered so that the suspected actually grabbed a water bottle, and one split-second later he was found with a knife in his hand? Was he posessed by a summoned spirit? Either by him or someone else. 

? The answer is: highly unlikely. Take an example: Do you think that there was a word among quichua people which could they use for reading, writing when no actions like that existed (except in zones where tawa was used as alphabet)? Do you think that there is a word for calliper there, denoting two limbs on arthropods like the ones under scholopendromorpha order? Names, actions, adjectives... they will vary with the world you live in, and you will rarely be able to keep a common denominator language across an entire galaxy, specially when communication cannot surpass lightspeed. (unless the needs covered by the interstellar communication can be expressed in actually decidable problems and algorirthms, in which case I suggest using Turing Machines as their lingua franca)
