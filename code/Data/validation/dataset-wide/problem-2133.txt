I'm wary of programmers who say they need to be "Trained" in order to do something--you should be able to research and solve just about any problem--that's your job. Also, I'm even MORE wary of management that doesn't recognize the fact that exposing engineers to concepts, languages, libraries, patterns and communities keeps them fresh, inquisitive, happy and productive. If Management really needs a business reason, they might look at some big successfull companies (Google, Microsoft, Amazon, ...) and consider how much they spend on this sort of activity and why. 

First of all what other people said is right--Just because a programmer has been around a while doesn't mean he has any clue what he's talking about. I had a team lead once tell me not to use the ?: operator in Java because "Nobody knows what that means". In a way, however, he's right. If the rest of my team is going to take more time pulling apart one line of code than an if statement, the if statement is the "correct" way to go. They both make the machine work the same. Also your field matters. In an enterprise situation your strongest focus should be on making your code readable, but in many other areas (Small teams/startups?) perhaps being able to write code quickly is more important. So to address some of your specific issues: Class size--Smaller is probably more maintainable. Period. You're good here. Try to do your best to avoid inheritence--I realize it's tough but it really does lead to confusing code. If you want to use code, try to use delegation wherever possible, leave inheritance for cases where it's really obvious that it is exactly what you need. Speed is one I struggle with. I take more time but often find that my code has less hitches in QA and later (Which tends to be more expensive to fix). Try following a small project through it's lifecycle and see how little of it is actually related to coding. Many people forget this. (Again, this can depend on your situation) Overall I'd say you probably have good instincts--the most important of which is to have an open mind and learn. It seems like every few years I'm picking up some technique that helps me code better--there is no book you can read to become an instant master--most is going to be learned through trial and error. One technique I can suggest: Be sure to examine old code you wrote every time you come across it with a critical eye--regardless if it's the next day or a year later. If you have trouble reading it, add comments and try to understand what you could have done better. If another developer doesn't understand your code, redo it (Chances are if someone doesn't understand it, you won't understand it either in 6 months--cute tricks are like that). 

If you had slept with his wife would it be reasonable for him to expect you to leave the company? If not it seems like there might be an argument that if you fired him it might be an abuse of your position. I'd personally do my best to keep business and home as separate as possible, but on the other hand if you have to look at him every day it could become difficult for you to get work done. 

One possible interpretation of your email is "The code sucks, @Bob did it". Although I doubt that's what you intended, it's possible that's how your boss read it. The biggest problem with that take on your email is that you might be seen as to be dodging responsibility. If you really wanted bob to fill in details, you could have gone and talked with him first and then not mentioned him in the email, or you could have just cc'd him which would have brought him into the discussion without calling him out--he's obviously a person of interest at least. 

I'm using "Jane Smith" as a placeholder for my birth/given name, and "Alice Jones" as a placeholder for my chosen name, and "Ally" as a short form of "Alice", though those aren't my real names. I am changing my name to "Alice Jones" for various reasons that I consider very personal, such as not wanting to bear my abusive parents' surname "Smith", and strongly disliking the meaning of my given name "Jane" for spiritual/personal reasons. I don't want to disclose these reasons to employers - the last thing I need when applying for a job is to talk about childhood trauma. I'm currently studying at university. I go by "Alice Jones" all of the time with my friends and with other students. My professors call me "Ally Smith" because they're much more used to the idea that someone could have a nickname / preferred name than a preferred surname. All of my achievements, such as GCSE and A level certificates, as well as stuff like my bank account, is under the name "Jane Smith". So I'm currently using "Jane Smith" on my CV. I want to switch to using "Alice Jones" on my CV as soon as I can, because it makes me feel much more comfortable. In addition, all of my friends call me Alice and sometimes I slip up and refer to myself as "Alice" in a situation where I'm supposed to be "Jane" - eg. I'll wear my "Alice" namebadge, or I'll mention that a friend said "Hi Ally" when telling a story. When someone says "Jane", it sometimes takes me a couple of seconds to realise they are talking to me. However, right now I don't feel like I can - for one thing, all of my references know me as Jane, for another all my certificates are under 'Jane Smith', and for another I will have to provide my birth name for bank details / tax forms and I do not really want to go through explaining to my employer that I'm changing my name to "Alice Jones" from "Jane Smith" for super personal reasons. I'm planning to get a legal name change, but probably not until after I am financially independent from my parents (which will be when I leave uni at the latest) since they'll be furious if they hear that I've changed my name. My question (which is similar to others I've seen asked but subtly different) is: WHEN should I make the changes? Should I make the de facto name change ASAP, or should I wait to put 'Alice Jones' on my CV until after I've legally changed my name to 'Alice Jones'? Should I get my name changed before I leave university, so that my degree certificate shows the new name, or should I not get it changed until after I've started at my first job, so that I'll be able to get employment using all of the certificates/references that know me as Jane Smith, and then I can look for second/third jobs knowing I have the reference from the first job that knows me as Alice Jones? Should I change in between uni and employment, so that it's not awkward (I don't have to tell everyone to change the name they address me by), or should I change it whilst in either uni or employment so that I don't have to be stuck in a name-changey looking-for-job no-references-with-proper-name limbo? Should I start using my new name for my online presence now, even when I'm not using it on my CV, so that I can build up an online presence in preparation for the name change, or should I always be using the same name for my CV and my website and similar things? If I put "Ally Smith" on my CV until I can properly change my name to "Alice Jones", will people think that is weird and unprofessional? (My real name is much more unusual than Alice, and the short form is much weirder and more informal than Ally.) Would you find it awkward or suspicious if you interviewed a candidate who put "Jane Smith" on their resume and introduced themselves as Jane, but then after you hired them, they said that they actually wanted to go by Alice? More or less awkward/suspicious who said that their former references would know them by a different name or that their uni certificates were under a different name? I already know that I am, eventually, going to make Alice Jones my legal name - it's just a question of what the timeline should look like, which really confuses me. 

They don't really mind the answer, they want you to imagine working there. As you answer those questions, the more you will identify working in this environement. So, yes, answer you avaibility, there is nothing dishonnest about it, but don't be fooled about the intent. 

Try to apply with consultancy companies. If there is some issues (diplomatic, security related, etc.) you should be able to get an answer from them. If there is a possibility for you to work in Europe, they will gladly obliged. Now, if you can never get far in the interview process with those companies, it's unlikely you will manage with sending CVs around. 

You are a new employee, it can be very risky to go around pointing finger. It seems the company has a policy of rewarding their employees for selling particular items. If it is the case and you qualified for this bonus, I would advice to take the low road and talk candidly to your manager. 

Another approached to your problem is to stop focusing so much on the development process. Maybe it's not well implemented, but at the end, your goal should be to satisfy your customer (and it's very hard to change processes in a project). If your requirements change too much, it's because your clients don't know what they want. It might be because of a lack of knowledge, inexperience, etc. It doesn't matter, it also doesn't matter whose fault it is. But they want to improve their business, and you are here to help them. That's why I would recommand to increase your dialog with your customer to UNDERSTAND what they want, why they want it, why they want it the way they asked it. It might be their job, but it will make you an awesome developper if you do that (it's much more fun too!) There is so much cases in which, by being passive, you are actually creating something useless for the client just because he thought of something, formulated in a way for some reason, you understand it in some fashion: TA DA: waste. Talk to they, ask WHY multiple time to understand their need. Once you understand what they need, you will be able to answer your own question/issue while developing and they will be thankful for that! 

It is not clear if you have signed the offer letter. In the case of having nothing signed, it seems risky to have resigned your position, but ok. As pointed out by Masked Man, the first new company could very well withdraw their offer [In the case of a signed offer letter, it might depend on the law of the country; maybe a small fee might be asked]. Now there is a confirmation email. It depends greatly on what you wrote. Let's say you wrote something like: 

In that way, when another offer comes along, you could still decide which way to go. As long as no contract is signed, nothing is decided. Now you have given your word to a company. To refuse the position now would be detrimental to your reputation. The impact of this action will depend of 

I would considere it an issue if the intervention of the recruiter had in any way an impact leading you to talk to this friend. Exemples: 

following the contact with the recruiter, you contact a friend you know to meet about the position: you should go with the recruiter. You were supposed to meet this friend before hand for other reasons. But since you get the information of an opportunity, you bring on the topic to your friend: you should go with the recruiter. You were suppose to meet this friend before hand for other reasons. Then you received the offer from the recruiter; but you don't mention it to your friend: He brings the topic on: it's a grey aera, could go either way.
