A highly eccentric orbit would affect seasons. With no Axial tilt, the seasons would be entirely governed by the distance to the sun, not the position of the sun in the sky which governs seasons on Earth as it is. To clarify, it's the Axial tilt that causes the seasons, not the distance to the sun. But as you specified with zero axial tilt, then the distance would govern the seasons, but at Earth's current eccentricity, that effect would be small. The greater the eccentricity the greater the seasonal variation in this hypothetical and the seasons would be planet wide, not alternating between the two hemispheres. Summer would also be shorter than winter due to the Earth moving faster around the sun at the closest point, The days themselves wouldn't be affected much. The length of a typical day (Synodic) would vary by a minute or two based on the Earth's orbital speed. It wouldn't be very noticeable but with a perfect 0 degree axial tilt, the 12 hours of sunshine would vary slightly based on orbital speed and position in the eccentric orbit. . . and the size of the sun in the sky and atmospheric refraction. . . . but only a couple minutes here or there with the Earth's current rotation speed. 

I think that's likely about right. In a nutshell, there's two basic questions here. How much mass was lost as a result of the giant impact and how much mass was gained after the giant impact during the late heavy bombardment and following collisions. We know that smaller bombardments on Mars has resulted in debris landing on Earth, so it seems highly likely that some debris was lost when Theia and Earth collided, but estimating how much is tricky and you'd really need to be well versed in the models to have a pretty good guess. One theory is that Theia formed in an Earth Trojan point so it shared the same orbit around the sun that the Earth did. Source This would cause a slower impact than a more oblique approach where the velocity of impact wouldn't be much greater than the Escape Velocity of Earth. If the impact velocity is only a bit above the necessary escape velocity and if a fair bit of energy is transferred into orbital momentum and heat, it's unlikely that a high percentage of debris would reach escape. Now if it was a faster impact from a more oblique orbital approach or a head on collision that would create greater compession and rebound, those two scenarios would likely lead to more material escaping. I can't give you precise numbers, this is more of general thinking about what might happen. Again, according to Wikipedia about 20% of the mass of Theia entered the earth's orbit after the impact. Orbital Velocity has to be at least Escape Velocity over the square root of 2 and less than escape velocity. Source So if we use 11 KM/s as an escape velocity estimate, anything that flew off the impact at less than 7.5 KM/s would have returned to Earth pretty quickly. A bit above 7.5 and maybe about 9 or so KM/s would be low Earth orbit and about 10 KM/s high earth, with 11 KM/s, likely escape and enter in a near earth orbit around the sun. You'd need a bit faster than that to have a truly outside of earth orbit. What percentage of Theia flew off at those velocities is hard to say, but I think it's likely that much of the planet slowed down upon impact and not too much escaped the Earth's Hill sphere, but I'd be guessing if I tried to put percentages to that. 

Source: $URL$ It's pattern looks similar to some of Earth's co-orbital asteroids, including 3753 Cruithne that I mentioned above. diagrams here: $URL$ So, that's probobly a more accurate comparison than Hildas. Look at 3753 Cruithne, or other planet's co-orbitals. What confuses me - and I hope you forgive me for only enough to be dangerous, as they say, but what confuses me is that your original link says it's an elliptical orbit but it also seems to be drawn to both L4 and L5, spending more time there, so I might have been incorrect in suggesting the elliptical orbit wouldn't be possible. - sorry bout that. At least, some additional eccentricity seems likely, but I'm guessing, probobly not a huge amount. If I was to guess, I'd guess that EN65 is less eccentric compared to Neptune than 3753 Cruithne is compared to Earth. Here's a cool picture of Jupiter's Trojans (Jupiter's the King of Trojans, it's got like 50,000 in both L4 and L5) and you'll probobly notice, there's one point at (or, perhaps more accurately, passing through) L3. 

Short answer is easy. Long answer, there's lots of maths involved, and I'm out of practice with my maths, but there's a few basic parts that your students should be able to follow. It's a little confusing, not too bad. We can ignore the Earth's motion around the sun for the most part but not the Earth's escape velocity. Start with Newton's cannonball thought experiment. That will get you into space, and that's an example of orbital velocity. With a fast enough launch, the cannonball enters into and stays in Earth's orbit. 2nd, explain the difference between escape velocity and orbital velocity. Escape velocity is greater than orbital velocity and the cannonball that orbits the earth hasn't really escaped the earth, it's still in the Earth's gravitational sphere of influence. You need escape velocity (or very close to it) to get to the moon, about 11.2 KM/s. You can get away with a bit less cause the Moon hasn't fully escaped the Earth either. Astronauts can't get shot out of a cannon at high speeds cause it's too many G forces, so what rocket launches do is accelerate over a few minutes. (you could probably look up the precise amount of G forces), but within G forces that humans can tolerate. If they experience 4Gs, they're accelerating the equivalent of 3Gs (or 29.4 meters per second), at least at first, as they move away from the Earth, the gravitational acceleration towards the earth drops and after only a few minutes they can shut down the launch and drift towards the moon. Most of the trip to the moon is done in this way, just drifting through space. You don't want to go too fast cause you'd just need to slow down as you approach the moon again and the moon has no atmosphere to assist the deceleration like the Earth does. The ships momentum traves through the combined gravitational field of, primarily, the Earth, Sun and Moon, and the Maths get pretty complicated, so the the launch needs to be quite precise. The Moon also orbits the Earth at about 2,300 miles per hour and that orbital speed has to be matched as well as, since the rocket will often enter a partial orbit around the moon, that orbital velocity around the Earth needs to be matched too. Once this is done, landing on the moon requires a simple enough deceleration to have a gentle enough touchdown to not harm any equipment. (this probably isn't as easy as it sounds). An orbit around the moon isn't strictly necessary but a partial orbit was used to assist landing on the desired spot. A partial orbit around the Earth was also used in the launch to the moon. They accelerate away from the Earth in 2 different times, first to leave the earth and get into Earth orbit. That's the big one, then from a different spot (and not even an hour later) to accelerate out of Earth's orbit towards the Moon. See diagram. 

Generally speaking, there's 2 types of planet systems in a binary - see pretty picture. Source. The writer is a sci-fi writer so the entire article might be of interest to you. 

More info Methlyene is a carbon with 2 hydrogen. This article, which is a pretty good summary, says: 

Saying an L4 or L5 object has exactly the same orbit as the planet is probobly inaccurate. The planet tugs on the L4 or L5 object anyway, so there's kind of a dance with Trojan objects. It might average out to being the same orbit, but it's never precisely the same on any given pass. Tugs from other planets affect the dance too. Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus all probobly tug on Neptune's Trojans, throwing off the clockwork a bit. 

Similarly, Jupiter Trojan objects, L4 and L5 and Jupiter Hildas are in mostly stable orbits due to the high mass of Jupiter, so it's a two fold answer. First is that late heavy bombardment removed most of the inner solar system objects that were bombardment candidates, and 2nd, the huge mass of Jupiter compared to the inner planets and the significant relative distance between Jupiter and Mars and the small mass of Mars), together creates a healthy amount of relatively stable orbital regions where asteroids can stay in stable orbit and not be in position to crash into the 4 inner planets or be subject to n-body instability of multiple body orbital systems. (I can add various articles on the stability of Jupiter's L4 and L5 and Hildas, but they're not hard to google). For Kuiper belt objects, I don't believe Jupiter has much of an effect pro or con, for earth impacts, though it blocks a few of those, but it should only be a small percentage, but I suspect Kuiper belt object collisions with inner planets are less frequent. For inner solar system objects (asteroid belt, L4, L5 & Hildas), that's where Jupiter significantly reduces impacts with inner planets, for most of the last 3.8 billion years. A curious sidebar is that Jupiter may, at some point in the future, stir things up in the solar-system again and create another much smaller heavy bombardment period. This would depend on the Jupiter-Mercury resonance and if Jupiter was able to pull Mercury away from the sun, as some models suggest it might. This is low probability and if it happens it won't happen for billions of years, but if Jupiter does cause Mercury to migrate away from the sun, Mercury passing through the asteroid belt, hildas and L4 or L5 would likely cause a significant increase in bombardment. This article doesn't mention the asteroid factor, but Mercury passing through any of the asteroid rich regions of the inner solar-system would stir things up quite a bit and significantly increase the chance of bombardment. 

Dark matter is essentially invisible to all light, unless there's enough of it to bend light, then it can be observed indirectly. 

Too long for a comment, so . . . It's important to remember that the field of primordial atmospheres has a good bit of uncertainty to it. I've tried to read up on it as a layman and there's a good deal of contradicting theories and not much certainty. Your first article addresses this uncertainty several times. 

I'm not sure I agree with the double planet POV, but the calculation is pretty simple. The earth weighs 81 moons, so for the Barycenter to be outside the earth, the distance (center of Moon to surface of earth), = 81 earth radii. 

Venus mass is sufficient to make a difference. Atmospheric escape has to do with escape velocity from the planets and Venus' escape velocity is over twice Mars'. Source. Venus' atmosphere is also sufficiently thick that it generates it's own magnetic protection of sorts, (I've read that, didn't see a good article to reference just now). Jupiter has an enormous magnetic field, which casts a pretty big net, much larger than the planet itself and that captures solar wind particles, but compared to the mass of Jupiter, the captured solar particles, even with the large magnetic net, is teeny-tiny and makes no real difference in the mass of the planet. Interestingly, when the sun approaches it's red giant stage, it's ejections will significantly increase, so it's possible that, 5 billion or so years from now the sun will feed Jupiter a stream of particles in a measurable way and Jupiter will grow larger and perhaps, visibly glow due to the particles it receives. Jupiter might be a fun planet to watch when our sun goes red giant, perhaps from the safe distance of a colony on Saturn's moon titan. But that's just speculation. :-) It will never turn into a star, it's far far far too light for that, but Jupiter could still be fun to watch (from a safe distance) 5 billion years from now. (My answers always tend to be too long). . . Corrections welcome. 

It would be more accurate to call them surveys than studies. A study looks at an object in detail. A survey counts and categorizes objects. Rogue planets are enormously difficult to see, and only a few very large ones have actually been observed directly. For the largest rogue planets, it's unclear if they actually are ejected planets as opposed to failed stars. This article discusses rogue planets in pretty good detail. In 2011 the MOA survey was published, estimating a high number of Jupiter sized Rogue planets, perhaps outnumbering stars. More recently the OGLE Project estimated about 1/10th that many rogue Jupiters, which is more in line with statistical predictions. Smaller planets are more likely to get ejected from their solar-systems than larger ones. Rogue Juiters outnumbering stars seemed unlikely and my understanding is that most scientists are more in line with the OGLE estimate than MOA. Both estimates rely on microlensing which amounts to very small and temporary changes when rogue planets drift between the Earth and a star. There's a fairly large margin of error for both surveys. NASA's WFIRST telescope should answer a lot of questions on rogue planets. It's not expected to be launched till the mid 2020s though.
