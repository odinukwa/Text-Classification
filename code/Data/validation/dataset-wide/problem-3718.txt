I want to run and need to know this to be able to get some runs in to keep on schedule. I haven't grown up near the gulf or ocean, so I dont know how close to the truth this is. Sometimes when there are lots thunderstorms overhead such that there are no space between them (overcast) the lightning seems to only hit the saltwater. In this very specific case is it true that the lightning will only the saltwater and is slightly safer to run? It seems to make sense electrically since cloud to cloud plus cloud to saltwater are lower resistance paths to more sources of static charge. 

The answer is no because weather changes too quickly for a 1-2 hour run. Even though the lightning map shows that all the lightning is restrained to the water for hours on end sometimes it changes and starts going on land without any obvious reason for it on any radar or any view of the same overcast sky. 

I agree with @jsmith but all the plans tend to follow a few specific guidelines. Here are the ones I'm following: 

If you can run one mile in 5:30 then are you guaranteed to be able to extend that pace to 5k, 10k, half marathon, or marathon distance? Ignoring time needed for exercising and building up for the distance. 

VO2 max is the amount of oxygen available for energy burn and is associated with runs that are shorter than 5-8 minutes total. Anything longer than this your body must deal with lactate acid buildup in your muscles. In other words I think its fair to say its good predictor for sprints assuming you are actually prepared and have been training to do this type of running. Most, if not all, of these predictors cannot be used alone to predict times. Maybe a 12 minute test can better predict how fast you can run the 10k. To get your body clearing up lactate better you need to do runs faster than, at the same as, and just slower than your lactate threshold pace about 1-2 times a week. Easy runs or cross training between with one 2-3 hour jog every 1-4 weeks. Lactate threshold is definitely the most likely factor limiting your 10k speed. Enjoy your 10k(s)! 

Training at or just below the lactate threshold is the main way to improve it. Well, at least the most direct. The lactate threhold pace is approximately a race pace that can be held for one hour. Considering this, Tempo Runs which are hard fast efforts lasting 20 to 40 minutes will train your body to run while producing and tolerating more lactate than can be cleared up. Steady State Runs are Med-Hard efforts that are run just a bit slower than the lactate threshold pace for 45 to 90 mins. This trains your body to run close to the lactate threshold pace withour crossing it and trains it to efficiently clear up lactate acid. 

I thought running repeats were a long distance version of intervals but Ive been reading up on intervals and found mile and km long interval workouts. Whats the difference between running intervals and repeats? 

If your not cheap like me then get with a coach or a local running club. Alot of people get into clubs and they sound like fun... 

From researching, Mount Sterling run from Big Creek campground, NC is a pretty good trail rising about 4200 feet over 5.9 miles. Also Mount Washington in NH is paved and rises 4700 feet over 7.5 miles. Very cool possibly found another from Gatlinburg to Monte LeConte rising about 4000 feet over 7 miles. This is probably a well traveled trail as well which means faster running. What others are out there?? 

It seems to me that intervals limit the time for your recovery before the next hard effort, and in repeats you fully recover between each hard effort. Ive seen intervals more often in training programs online where your building up fitness to run a 5k or 10k, and repeats mainly for speed work which probably helps avoid injuries. Actually I just started reading up on speedwork when I asked this question... 

Please ignore dehydration issues. Is there any evidence or does anyone know if losing water without replacing it will make you slow down? I was shocked to see that I lost about 5 lbs of water weight after running, so I'm thinking that the body would automatically slow down to counter the loss of water. This is a question about whether or not this phenomenon exists or not. Math to calculate it would be great though. One other interesting phenomenon I've learned is that running in heat will divert blood from your muscles in order to help regulate body temp which will then slow you down automatically. Also humidity will bottleneck this cooling process and make it harder to keep cool. When winter came I ran pretty fast! Thanks. 

I think Eric Kaufman's answer is better, but a good exercise I found recently is jogging on my toes while intentionally pushing myself vertically up more than normal. I am tried to increase air time while running but noticed alot of soreness for just 30 min of doing this each time I do it; which is 2-3 times so far. 

Speed walk the goal distance you plan to attempt 1-3 weeks in advance as part of your training program. Generally I think speed walking would help you improve both on your running pace and meet your goal of running longer. Otherwise, once a week as part of training more than 1-3 weeks out run about 25% of your normal longest run at a hard effort. Use 5 minutes to warm up and cool down as part of the 25%. For longer distances you'll find more plans will recommend that you run at least 60-80% of your goal distance at least once 3-4 weeks before the race. For the marathon most will recommend no more than 18-22 miles for first timers, so training doesn't necessarily require the full distance. Im not familiar the couch to 5k plan (I like the time vs distance idea) but adding a 90-180 minute run on the weekend will help you meet your distance goals, and this long run will help you gain the endurance to run harder and faster for shorter distances. In fact getting this long run in at least once a month can help you do faster sessions. Almost guaranteed. 

I would stop when I hear or feel grinding noise, or use lighter weights if that gets rid of the feeling. My reason would be because of a similar no pain grinding feeling from my neck would follow with 2-3 weeks of swelling and pain that build up slowly over a couple of days then goes away slowly over a few weeks. I run during this time but only because I dont hear or feel any grinding noise or pain. In your case there seems to be no swelling or pain associated with it, but I would work around the grinding instead of pushing through it. 

All day today in Pinellas County Florida the lightning stayed confined to the water, but about mid-day the pan handle had a slew of lightning strikes that appeared only on land. Unfortunately its impossible to know if it was overcast and stretched over both water and land. 

Is it possible to run at your maximum heart rate? I dont think a running maximum heart rate is the same as an absolute maximum heart rate, but I have no evidence for this. One answer to a Stackexchange question of how to find your max heart rate states that you will pass out before hitting your max. McMillan's pace graph implies that there is a pace at which running faster will no longer increase your heart rate. That implies sprinting is possible at max HR. 

No, those formulas are for the VO2 amount you used/expended and is not your max. The largest one of the set should be a good minimum number for what your max might be. The max VO2 can be considered a physiological constant of your body over an entire run, and it only changes over a matter of months of running or at 2 or more weeks at best. I dont know if you can achieve your max VO2 during exercise. I believe that you cant achieve your max heart rate without fainting, so I bet this is similar. There are alot of calculators and your link has a link to one, but check out some places locally that can do it. On their website usually your find the method or procedure they use summarized. That can help you understand what exactly the VO2 max is. Also note that if you want to predict race times you would need to know your lactate threshold instead any races or efforts that last longer than 5-8 minutes. 

It could be blood sugar but since its summer it could be a lack of water in combination with heat and the meal sitting in your stomach. It takes some water just to digest your food too. I get nauseous when I run after eating, and usually the afternoon can be the warmest time of the day. Ive learned how to deal with this but usually for longer runs; time-wise. You should start running in the morning if possible when your food is digested and energy stores are ready. Plus breakfast would be right after a run to help balance the blood sugar :) I don't think you'll get a straight answer on this since the source can be so many things. Here is an example of throwing up that is related to eating and running. 

Help, summer running in 83-93 deg F (28-34 deg C) and 60-80 %RH stinks. Update: Actually this was usually 78-83 def F at +95% RH in the mornings. I want to get faster, but literally I cannot run fast in the summer. Except for short distances like 5k its impossible to see improvement over time during the summer. My question is whether or not I'll get faster at marathon length distances even though I'm not running long distances or medium length distances at a fast pace. Though the effort level is the same. Another way to phrase this question is: To gain long distance speed must you physically attain similar speeds or are there other modes you body can be in that is slower but will improve your speed? Update ----------------------------------------------- I got slower due to the lack of time out on my feet and lack of water + nutrition. Plus refusing to stop to get water or some food... This has changed over July, August, and September. Though times are slow I know Im getting faster, and on a few recent mornings when the dew point dropped, or maybe there was some wind, I hit some PRs! So the body acclimated and improved just in time to start training for Florida's marathon season! 

After a year of running and learning more about it I can verify the two answers below are true. No you cant automatically extend the pace further unless you have the potential to run the shorter distance faster. In some cases I think training for longer distances help build you up for the shorter ones. 

Id say up to 50k the first half is a jog, second half is a run and last quarter is hard running. This matches my favorite race strategy that tends to work so this is most likely biased. Its interestimg to see what happens for a run of +6 hours when the half way mark is much longer than a normal long training run. 

It is the same but the value is more like 40-45F not 60F. I was mentally stuck on a number of 60F that Ive heard about some long time ago, so I didnt even read the article close enough. My personal fastest times came with temps around 45F. Loved the NOAA heat index provided by brentwpeterson; it was right on target. Once again I had a heat index table and some other methodology that didnt match up with what I was seeing. The NOAA heat index is spot on. My area is +95% RH nearly every morning and I definitely notice the ramp up in heat just above 80F. Plus the increase in heat index due to the sun and decrease due to wind is something Ive noticed as well. The impact on pace is dramatic, and for me at the time I wasnt drinking properly making it even worst. One note for people reading this and trying to deal with humidity. From my experience short fast runs 3-4 miles doesnt have the same dramatic impact that longer runs have. My 5k speed is progressing evenly through all seasons and it definitely depends more one training than weather, so summer is for speedwork I guess and learning how to do the ultra shuffle for long runs.
