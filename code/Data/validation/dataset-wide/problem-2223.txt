Set: Races where athletes are likely to gain an advantage by anticipating the start are also in the races which include a "set" stage in the start sequence ("To your marks," "set", BANG). The rules provide for the starter verifying that all athletes are in the proper set position (also defined in the rules) before sounding the gun. They could do this before allowing a mechanical process to take over, but because the time between "set" and the start is the main unpredictable variable for starters, this probably wouldn't help much. In other words, to make the start truly predictable, we would need to remove the requirement that the starter verify all runners are in the "set" position before starting. Jumping the gun: The idea that the start should be predictable changes the actual race being timed. As the rules currently stand, the race starts with the athlete hearing the starting sound and ends when their torso breaks the plane of the finish line. As such, the athlete's ability to react to the starting sound efficiently and effectively is part of the event as it stands. By making the start predictable, you change the beginning of the race to being from the starting signal, and you allow the athlete to anticipate the signal (as long as they don't actually move). (I hope I've explained that change clearly enough.) This changes the race significantly on paper even if it seems like a slight change in theory. 

All of these resources are available to a dedicated fan, many for free and the rest for a relatively low price. The bound annuals are probably the most expensive due to printing costs, and as more and more publication moves to the web the books are increasingly available as PDFs. Membership in professional organizations like the ATFS (Association of Track and Field Statisticians) or TAFWA/FAST (Track And Field Writers of America/Federation of American Statisticians of Track) in the USA often provides access to additional resources; I get PDF or bound copies of the world and USA annuals either through TAFWA or through the national and international federations. At the bigger meets, an additional resource which isn't available to the fans is what's known as a CIS or Commentator Information Service. This is a terminal in the press section which gives access to live results, entry lists, splits, and some historical data. Increasingly the same information is appearing on event websites - the IAAF website has almost the same data online as in the CIS - but as a dedicated on-site system the CIS isn't subject to the same kind of network latency a website usually shows. Being on-site also allows the press access to information which programmers would call "asynchronous," that is, not happening within view of the camera. This includes things like post-event disqualifications and protests. I assume similar resources are available to stadium sports like swimming and tennis. Outside-stadium events like marathons, race walks, and (I assume) road cycling or skiing have additional challenges in that spectators and reporters alike have severely limited information about the progress of an ongoing event. As an example, both the Boston and New York City marathons have elaborate systems of spotters on bicycles reporting information back to the press room to help television commentators understand how fast the leaders are going, and even who's in the pack. Every event faces different challenges in collecting this kind of detailed information and communicating it in a useful way; journalists are usually the first to get access to the data. ETA summer 2016: With the US Olympic Trials for athletics approaching, I was reminded of another source of information: dedicated insiders who are self-publishing. The specific example I had in mind is the decathlon association which has published a "media guide" for the decathlon and heptathlon at the Trials; this is packed with lists of previous winners, all-time best performances in each event, at an Olympic Trials, at a national championships (the Trials doubles as the USA national championships), or at Hayward Field where the Trials are being held. The majority of this is the work of Dr. Frank Zarnowski. The multi-events even have "prediction sites" where curious fans can plug in various scenarios of athletes' performances in each event and see how the overall event would play out; an example (which used to live at the ergorej.net domain) is the Beijing World Championship decathlon in 2015 where Ashton Eaton set the world record. ETA 2: The IAAF statistical handbook for the 2016 Rio Olympic Games has been published now (that link is to a PDF download). 

This is going to depend a lot on the sport. In general, a reporter does have access to several resources, many of which are accessible to a dedicated fan, but when putting together commentary on the spot it helps a lot to have deep personal knowledge of the sport to consider what facts to research. (This kind of knowledge can be developed by a fan regularly reading publications like Track and Field News, Athletics Weekly, and/or the IAAF website.) I've covered athletics (track and field) at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing and six IAAF World Championships starting in 1999, as well as many lesser meets. This is a rough overview of the compiled resources available to an athletics writer: 

Specifically for the long jump, the issue for the competitors is their starting marks. They set themselves up very carefully for their jumps in order to make their last stride as close to the board as possible without being on it (i.e. fouling). As @steelerfan's answer explains, a "fast" track or runway is giving the athlete more "return" for the force they apply to it, which means more of the energy they produce goes to pushing them forward (instead of being absorbed by the track). This usually means a track which feels "harder," because it is pushing back more on the athlete. A softer or springier track usually isn't as "fast". The differences are usually incredibly small. If the runway is "faster" than they expect, they're getting more energy return from the runway and taking slightly longer strides than they allowed for when setting their mark. This very small additional distance, repeated for each stride, could put their takeoff onto the board and cause a foul. So while a "fast" runway is nominally a good thing, it can lead competitors in the horizontal jumps (long jump and triple jump) to foul more often. 

It's difficult to quantify the effect of lane placement in the 200m and 400m (the sprint races which require running bends) because there are competing factors in place. A victory from lane 8, like Van Niekirk's, is indeed extraordinary, but that race was perhaps more extraordinary because he broke a longstanding world record, without apparently planning to do so, and dominated a high-quality field. (That is, the run would have been extraordinary regardless of the assigned lane.) The bare differences between the lanes are twofold: 

When I tried archery many years ago, I was taught the same, for recurve bows as well as compound. The explanation is that drawing the bow stores energy in the limbs of the bow (flexing them). When released with an arrow, that energy is ideally transferred to the arrow, but without an arrow the energy has nowhere to go; the result is vibration in the string and limbs which damages the limbs. Relaxing the bow slowly is safe because the stored energy is being transferred, essentially, back to the arm of the person who drew it. (I'm less confident in this part because I may be mis-remembering it: some bows may actually advise flexing the bow gently a few times in just this manner before shooting, to "warm it up".) 

A gun provides a single, relatively discrete sound at a relatively constant volume throughout a meeting. The volume of a whistle will vary from blow to blow, depending on how it's blown. Also, a whistle is not a sharp sound; it's harder to pinpoint the exact moment of race starting, which is both challenging to the athletes and also difficult for the race timers in events where finish times are sliced to thousandths of a second. (Results are listed to hundredths with automatic timing, but the systems can time to thousandths; the extra precision is used to separate ties.) This last is perhaps more important: in the days of Fully Automatic Timing (FAT) the starting signal needs to trigger the timing system. A specially configured starter's pistol can do that, but there have also been systems using a different audible signal, e.g. a loud handclap. 

"Area Records" can also be called "Continental" records, since the IAAF's "Areas" align roughly with the continents: Europe, Asia, Africa, South America, NACAC, Oceania. You see a lot of these at Olympic and World Championships. The use, in the USA, of "American Record" to indicate a national record means the "AR" abbreviation can be ambiguous. There's also a concept formally known as "All-Comers Records" which is similar to national records. A national record is the fastest time by a citizen of a given state, regardless of where it's run, e.g. if Nick Willis sets a national record in Boston, it's still the New Zealand record despite being run in the USA. The all-comers record is the fastest time inside the borders of a given state, regardless of the nationality of the athlete. For example, most of the all-comers records in China were run by foreign athletes at the 2008 Olympics or 2015 World Championships. All-comers records are a non-issue at a national event like the Olympic Trials, in which all athletes share a single nationality, but can be hyped by meet promoters in other contexts (and sometimes there's a legitimate thrill to it: "Nobody has ever run this fast here!") 

In 1972 the NFL moved the hash marks closer together, "looking for a way to produce more action and more touchdowns, now that defenses have become so effective". The article goes on to add, 

Athletics (track and field) is contested across several surfaces. The "road" disciplines are contested on city streets (concrete, tarmac, etc.) and cross-country is in parks (grass, rocks, trails, etc.), but those could be argued to be different from track and field. Within specific disciplines, several events are contested on different surfaces. Most notably, track events may be contested on 400m unbanked outdoor tracks and 200m banked (or unbanked) indoor tracks, even though the actual track surface may be the same indoors and out. The shot put uses different equipment indoor and out because the shot is put into a sector marked in sand or grass outdoors, but is usually landing on a hard (or lightly padded) floor indoors. The characteristics of the runways used for the pole vault, triple jump and long jump can vary significantly from indoors to outdoors. Leaving aside the indoor/outdoor distinction, while all-weather synthetic surfaces are now the norm in athletics, until Mexico City in 1968 the Olympic track events were still contested on packed "cinder" tracks (with interesting results in Tokyo, where rainy weather made the inside lane of the track soft and uneven late in the distance races). Also, some grass tracks are still maintained, although not often used for competition these days. The rules of the sport allow for all of these surfaces. 

Distance running is another sport where a smaller athlete may have an advantage. When work = mass * distance, an athlete with smaller mass will do less work to cover the distance. If two athletes have the same capacity for rate of work - that is, they can do the same amount of work in a given span of time - the lighter one will win a race. There are limits to this - at some point being lighter limits your capacity to do work - but in general lighter is better for distance runners.
