The parametrization \eqref{2} can be deduced, quite laboriously, using Weierstrass elliptic functions and the product expansion for $\Delta$. However, when we clear the denominators, equation \eqref{1} (possibly) becomes an identity between modular forms and such identities should be easy to prove using the fact, that the space of modular forms has a finite dimension. Can this be done? What can we say about $\Delta(2\tau)$? It is a modular form with respect to some group? 

Here $\mathcal O_D$ is the unique quadratic order with discriminant $D$. The important consequence is that, given a CM point $z$, then the set of $m$ with the property that $\Phi_m(j(z),j(z))=0$ depends only on the disriminant $D$, not on $z$ itself. Therefore we can relate this with the class number $h(D)$. If $z_1,...,z_{h(D)}$ are the inequivalent points pertaining to the discriminat $D$ then either all of these points are roots of a given modular equation $\Phi_m(X,X)$ or none are. Let $$H_D(X)=\prod_{i=1}^{h(D)}\left(X-z_i\right).$$ Zagier now claims $$\Phi_m(X,X)=\pm\prod_{D<0}H_D(X)^{r_D(m)/w_D},\label{1}\tag{1}$$ if $m$ is not a square. Here is $$r_D(m)=\#\lbrace (t,u)\in \mathbb Z^2:t^2-D^2u^2=4m\rbrace=\#\lbrace \lambda\in \mathcal O_D: N(\lambda)=m\rbrace,$$ $$w_D=\# \text{ number of units in }\mathcal O_D. $$ However, Zagier is here very brief and I do not understand how he arrived at \eqref{1}. Why should the formula \eqref{1} hold? Note that if $F(a,a)=0$ then the multiplicity of $a$ as a root of $F(X,a)$ and $F(X,X)$ may differ. Let $D$ be a discriminant. Then by a suitable choice of elements $\lambda\in\mathcal O_D$ we should be able to achieve that $H_D(X)$ is the greatest common divisor of finitely many modular equations. This would show that the coefficients of $H_D(X)$ were rational. How to do this? How to choose the norms? (Cf. Zagier's article for more details.) 

(All this stated in more technical language, of course.) There is no reference to the notion of “finite” here. Instead, number 3 above gives us, by definition, the principle of induction. For example, how do you show that some object X is not a natural number? Well, if for some property P, you can show P(0) and you can also show that ∀n: P(n)⇒P(n') where the prime denotes the successor function, but X fails property P, then you can know for sure that X is not a natural number. Edit: I see I did not answer all your questions. I am not a logician, so take this with a grain of salt. But basically, in first order logic (in which ZFC is expressed) it is impossible to make circular definitions, and if you can't make one, you can't repair it. The circularity, as I see it, all exists on the meta-level, before you have even gotten around to formalizing the theory. So “breaking the circularity” must in essence happen in the transition between the informal and the formal. Strictly speaking, first order theories don't even allow definitions at all! What you have to do is to notice that there is a complicated formula NN(x) that we interpret as “x is the set of natural numbers”, and a theorem ∃!x NN(x) in ZFC (where ∃! is short for “there exists a unique …”); then we create a new theory by adding the symbol ω and adding the axiom NN(ω). Now, any formula A(ω) in the new theory can be rewritten in the old theory as ∃x:NN(x)∧A(x), so nothing new has really happened, except for a great amount of simplification. 

My hunch is that the answer is no, but I couldn't find that statement in the literature. Perhaps it can be shown using an invariant of structured ring spectra, some flavor of $THH$. Or perhaps a dg-algebra over $\mathbb{Z}$ doesn't have enough room to encode the homotopical structure of the Steenrod algebra [1]. Remark. For the sake of definiteness, feel free to pick a model of spectra such as $S$-modules or symmetric spectra. The question is meant to be about the underlying symmetric monoidal $\infty$-category. In light of [2], working with your favorite model of spectra should be fine. [1] Shipley, Brooke, $H\Bbb Z$-algebra spectra are differential graded algebras, Am. J. Math. 129, No. 2, 351-379 (2007).

Here are two examples similar to Ben's answer, followed by an example with a path-connected space. Let $[X,Y]$ denote the naive pointed homotopy classes of pointed maps. We're comparing the (say, unreduced) singular cohomology functor $H^n(X;G)$ to the naively represented functor $[X_+, K(G,n)]$. As Chris pointed out, singular cohomology is representable in the derived sense, i.e., agrees with its value on a CW approximation of $X$. Example 1. Let $T \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ be the topologist's sine curve $$T = \{ (x, \sin \frac{1}{x}) \mid x \in (0,1] \} \cup \{(0,0)\}.$$ Its zeroth singular cohomology is the finite product $$H^0(T;\mathbb{Z}) = \mathrm{Hom}_{\mathbb{Z}}(H_0(T;\mathbb{Z}), \mathbb{Z}) = \mathrm{Set}(\pi_0(T),\mathbb{Z}) = \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}.$$ Its zeroth naive cohomology is $$[T_+, K(\mathbb{Z},0)] = \mathrm{Set}(\ast,\mathbb{Z}) = \mathbb{Z}.$$ A CW approximation $S^0 \stackrel{\sim}{\to} T$ induces on zeroth naive cohomology the diagonal inclusion $\mathbb{Z} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}$. Example 2. Let $X \subset \mathbb{R}$ be $$X = \{ \frac{1}{n} \mid n \in \mathbb{N} \} \cup \{0\}.$$ Let me name the points $x_n = \frac{1}{n}$ and $x_{\infty} = 0$ for convenience. The zeroth singular cohomology is the countable product $$H^0(X;\mathbb{Z}) = \mathrm{Set}(\pi_0(X),\mathbb{Z}) = \prod_{n \in \mathbb{N} \cup \{\infty\}} \mathbb{Z}.$$ The zeroth naive cohomology is the subgroup $$[X_+, K(\mathbb{Z},0)] = \{ (a_n) \in \prod_{n \in \mathbb{N} \cup \{\infty\}} \mathbb{Z} \mid (a_n) \text{ is eventually constant}\},$$ which happens to be a free abelian group on countably many generators. A CW approximation from the discrete space $\coprod_{x \in X} \{x\} = \mathbb{N} \cup \{\infty\} \stackrel{\sim}{\to} X$ induces on zeroth naive cohomology the inclusion of said subgroup. Example 3. Let $E = \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} C_n$ be the Hawaiian earring, where $C_n \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ denotes the circle of radius $\frac{1}{n}$ centered at $(\frac{1}{n},0)$. There is a surjective map $H_1(E; \mathbb{Z}) \twoheadrightarrow \prod_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \mathbb{Z}$; see for instance Hatcher Example 1.25 or [1]. Dualization into $\mathbb{Q}$ yields an injective map $$\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathbb{Z}}(\prod_{i \in \mathbb{N}} \mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Q}) \hookrightarrow \mathrm{Hom}_{\mathbb{Z}}(H_1(E; \mathbb{Z}), \mathbb{Q}) = H^1(E; \mathbb{Q}),$$ which shows that the first singular cohomology $H^1(E; \mathbb{Q})$ has uncountable dimension as a vector space over $\mathbb{Q}$. Indeed, the vector space $$\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathbb{Z}}(\prod_{i \in \mathbb{N}} \mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Q}) = \mathrm{Hom}_{\mathbb{Q}}(\mathbb{Q} \otimes_{\mathbb{Z}} (\prod_{i \in \mathbb{N}} \mathbb{Z}), \mathbb{Q})$$ has uncountable dimension since $\mathbb{Q} \otimes_{\mathbb{Z}} (\prod_{i \in \mathbb{N}} \mathbb{Z})$ does. Now denote $W_n = \bigcup_{i=1}^n C_i \cong \bigvee_{i=1}^n S^1$ and consider the retraction $E \to W_n$ that collapses all the circles $C_i$ with $i>n$ to the basepoint. Take a CW complex $K(\mathbb{Q},1)$. Any (pointed) map $E \to K(\mathbb{Q},1)$ is (pointed) homotopic to a map which factors as $E \to W_n \to K(\mathbb{Q},1)$ for $n$ large enough. This shows that the map $$\bigoplus_{i \in \mathbb{N}} \mathbb{Q} = \operatorname{colim}_n [W_n, K(\mathbb{Q},1)] \twoheadrightarrow [E,K(\mathbb{Q},1)]$$ is surjective, and thus the naive cohomology group $[E,K(\mathbb{Q},1)]$ is countable. In particular, a CW approximation $X' \stackrel{\sim}{\to} X$ induces a non-surjective map on naive cohomology $[E,K(\mathbb{Q},1)] \to H^1(E;\mathbb{Q})$. Edit. For the record, I previously thought that a similar argument would work with integral cohomology $H^1(E;\mathbb{Z})$, but I had forgotten Specker's theorem $\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathbb{Z}}(\prod_{i \in \mathbb{N}} \mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Z}) \cong \bigoplus_{i \in \mathbb{N}} \mathbb{Z}$. In fact, it turns out that said cohomology group is $H^1(E;\mathbb{Z}) \cong \bigoplus_{i \in \mathbb{N}} \mathbb{Z}$, as explained here.

If some rectangle of measure zero has a side of infinite measure, divide that side into a countable number of sides of finite measure. In other words, you may arrange things so that none of the $T_j$ has any side of infinite measure. 

An arbitrary union, or a finite intersection, of open sets in a topological space is again open. What name is given to the hypothetical property that an arbitrary intersection of open sets is open? As an example, consider a partially ordered set $X$. Call a subset $U\subseteq X$ open if $y\le x\in U$ implies $y\in U$. (Bonus question: Are there other interesting examples?) 

Sure. Let $\{x_1,x_2,\ldots\}$ be dense in $E$, let $K_0=\emptyset$ and let $K_n$ be a compact neighbourhood of $K_{n-1}\cup\{x_n\}$ for $n=1,2,\dots$. Just make sure that $K_n$ contains a sufficiently large ball around $x_n$: Say if $\epsilon<1$ and $B_{2\epsilon}(x_n)$ is precompact, then insist on $B_\epsilon(x_n)\subseteq K_n$. Now if $y$ is not in the union and $B_{3\epsilon}(y)$ is precompact, then $x_n\in B_\epsilon(y)$ will imply $y\in K_n$. 

I am not sure where I found the translation. Sloppy of me. 2nd Edit: here is a very brief outline of Cantor's non-diagonal proof. By induction on $k$, find $\alpha_k$, $\beta_k$ as early as possible from the given sequence with $$\alpha<\alpha_1<\alpha_2<\cdots<\beta_2<\beta_1<\beta$$ and note that any number the the closed interval $[\alpha_\infty,\beta_\infty]$ is not in the given sequence. If the induction fails after step $k$, the interval $(\alpha_k,\beta_k)$ contains at most one point from the given sequence. 

Edit: This answer is wrong. But, since Anton based his answer on this idea, I am leaving it up. No. Let $A$, resp. $B$, be the graph $x=f(y)$, resp. $x=g(z)$, for some continuous functions $f$ and $g$. Pick numbers $0<d<b<a<c<1$, and arrange things so that $f(0)=g(0)=0$, $f(1)=g(1)=1$, and $f(y)$ grows from 0 to $a$, then decreases to $b$, then finally increases to 1, whereas $g(z)$ grows from $0$ to $c$, decreases to $d$, and increases to 1. (Here, $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$ are function values, i.e., values of $x$, not of the arguments $y$ or $z$.) Now if $C$ projects to $A$ and $B$, respectively, it is not hard to see that $(0,0,0)\in C$ and $(1,1,1)\in C$. Trying to move $(x,y,z)$ continuously from the former to the latter, a contemplation of how $x$ must grow and shrink in order to maintain $x=f(y)$ and $x=g(z)$ leads to a contradiction. (Hard to put in words, but a pair of graphs reveals it I think.)
