However, of the five example he gave, two were companies, one was a willful choice between offenses, and one is indeterminate. In none of these examples does he show why . All of these are highly unusual circumstances, most of which are not crimes for the people who executed them. It's possible he chose his examples poorly, but an introduction which fails to even address your thesis is a good indication that the thesis won't be addressed sufficiently in the rest of the work. 

Actually, it is a federal crime to open another person's mail, regardless of whether you are related to them. The relevant statute is 18 U.S. Code ยง 1703 - Delay or destruction of mail or newspapers, section (b), paragraph 2: 

Silvergate frames this as being indicted for destroying contraband rather than keeping it, and says "therefore holding, rather than destroying it, arguably would be criminal." This is really a lose-lose situation for the lawyer, because he knowingly took possession of contraband. Either he's convicted for destroying evidence of a crime (and he was a lawyer, so knew it would be relevant), or he's convicted for possessing it in the first place. (Side note: If he had turned it over, it's unlikely he would have been in any trouble for temporarily having someone else's laptop.) But this is not a common situation, and most people will never encounter it. Case #2 

The reviewer then notes that this story falls into the category of examples where the reincarnated person's identity was known, but the family of the deceased had contact with the "reincarnated" children. (Or, as in this case, was the same family.) He then describes this case as follows: 

I skimmed the sections of his book available on Amazon, and didn't see any proof for his claims. Admittedly, this is only a sampling of the book, but the claims he does make don't justify his position. For example, there is a section which begins I'll address each case he lists in this section, under the assumption that these are some of his strongest arguments. Text double-quoted below is not quotes from his book, but rather my own short summary of what the charge was and a link to a relevant news article or Wikipedia. Case #1 

It's a fact of life that almost no media coverage of poll results ever discusses the error margins. But that's where almost all the fluctuation in polling comes in. If one poll predicts a candidate will get 47% of the vote +/- 1%, and another predicts that candidate will get 52% of the vote +/- 5%, then when the second poll is released all the media coverage will be about how much the candidate's position has improved, even though the error margins are so high that (in the absence of any other information), the candidate is really getting closer to 48% of the vote (and is thus likely losing). Because exit polls have even higher error margins than normal polls, their numbers are that much less reliable. Error bars on statistical results are of huge importance. I can say right now, over a year out from the next presidential election, that the Republican candidate will receive 51% of the vote, +/- 49%. If the media were reporting on my prediction, they'd say that I said the as-yet-unnamed Republican was ahead... but I really said that it was way too uncertain to say anything at all (other than that the Republican will get votes, because my floor was 2% total). 

Once the mail has been delivered to the person to whom it is addressed (and in the case of a spouse that could simply be bringing it into the house - no matter who does so), then opening it appears to be considered theft/destruction of personal property, rather than of mail. (source) 

Assuming that the sources are correct, there's no truth to this legend, because the "paper" name wasn't introduced until long after the game had spread out of China. 

There is no exception in the law for spouses. That said, if it is your customary behavior to allow someone else (spouse or otherwise) to collect and open your mail, then that is a valid defense if they're ever prosecuted for opening your mail, and (barring hostile circumstances, such as going through a divorce) it's unlikely they would be punished. 

These two mostly stand by themselves, but together they sortof explain why exit polls lean Democratic. In a busy polling place, even one where there's an even mix of people, if someone makes themselves more approachable by the pollster, they're more likely to be polled. If more Democrats than Republicans are willing to be polled (the link to the proof of which is dead in the article, and the reasons are not discussed), then the results will obviously skew Democratic. 

Additionally, this article describes an investigation where three NC state representatives and one state senator were found to have matching names and dates of birth with registered voters in other states. So while the original article used enough weasel words that it's not technically wrong, the scale of fraud it described is grossly exaggerated. 

The Old Jail Museum in Jim Thorpe, PA, formerly the Carbon County Jail has one cell with a handprint on the wall. According to legend (emphasis mine): 

Silvergate claims this charge was simply a way to justify the time spent investigating Kurtz for bioterrorism due to his art. This one is irrelevant to Silvergate's argument. Kurtz was convicted for something that wasn't a crime, and thus can't be an example of a felony. Case #5 I'm not even going to research this one: The DoJ "reportedly looked into" indicting the New York Times for espionage for their reporting of the NSA's warrantless surveillance programs. Since it was just "looked into", there's nothing relevant here. Since it was (again) a company, there's doubly nothing. 

Live Science: Why It's So Hard To Make Nuclear Weapons Also, the main obstacle is enriching enough uranium to have it be capable of being used to trigger a thermo-nuclear explosion. It seems like most of your concern focuses on the idea that a nuclear plant makes for a juicy explosive target that could set off a nuclear explosion. The differences between enrichment needed for power generation and weaponization make that not so. In order to be "weaponized," uranium much be enriched to a level of Uranium 235 of 80% or more (ratio of U-235 to U-238). Union of Concerned Scientists: Fissile Material Basics In order to be capable of a fission reaction for power generation, that level is below 5%. So, even if I have a reactor running on 20% enriched fuel, a direct hit isn't going to trigger a massive explosion. WorldNuclear.org: Uranium Enrichment HOWEVER, due to space constraints and the desire to get maximum bang for the buck, the nuclear military vessels do use uranium that has been enriched to a weaponized level. The design of the power plants is such that it isn't concentrated all together to reach that supercritical mass. You have many separate fuel rods, along with slowly dissipating materials that dampen the reactions for a more even, long-term "burn" of the fuel. On a side note, there is obviously concern about proliferation of stolen weapon grade materials with more uses in a more widespread manner. Moreso, probably, than fears about an accident or explosion from a strike. Wikipedia: Nuclear Marine Propulsion BlueBird Electric: USS Dwight D Eisenhower (has photo of nuclear fuel rod array) In slamming together the sub-critical masses into a supercritical one, a conventional explosive charge is carefully crafted, designed and triggered. Being hit by a bomb or shell would not have these characteristics. Now, there are the dangers of any normal nuclear power plant - if the reactions get too vigorous, the reactions will speed up to the point where the heat can't be controlled and the generator, itself, will melt down. There would be danger of fuel ignition if a carrier used diesel, kerosene, gasoline, coal or whale oil, though. Nuclear doesn't seem to be that much of a danger. Radioactivity is probably the main concern. So why not use it in regular transportation? Well, the nature of a military naval vessel is that it's going to be heavily armored and protected against attack. As such, any kind of shielding or protection to prevent radioactivity from harming the crew would not be an imposition upon the design of the craft, which does not put a premium on maximum fuel efficiency. They also have massive numbers of crews designated to running all of the ships processes and systems, including the power plants and engines, no matter what the design. Nuclear plants require constant monitoring and management. Are we going to trust someone who doesn't know how to use the turn signal properly to monitor and manage a mini nuclear power-plant in their vehicle? The scale of the operation needed to run an aircraft carrier makes a nuclear plant not a bad option. Not true for your compact Kia. 

UK Office of National Statistics - Divorces in England and Wales: 2013 So, let's break down those numbers. 54% of 65% (behavior cited in cases granted to the wife) were for behavior in ex-wife-granted divorces, so that amounts to 35.1% of the grand divorce total. Add to that cases granted to the husband where behavior is cited, 31% of 35%, or 10.85% of the total of all divorces. Our starting point, of all cases where behavior was a factor, is 45.95% of divorces. Take 1/3 of that (statistic for Facebook being introduced in cases where behavior is a cause), and you have 15.32% of all divorces in the UK having Facebook used to show behavior.... if that quoted claim is true, to start with. It seems to still be a large number, but not I'm not sure if that's really "involved," which has the connotation of being a cause or factor. If I hire a private detective to follow my spouse, and they bring back photos that prove infidelity, the infidelity is the factor. Is a camera "involved"? I suppose, but the infidelity, itself, has nothing to do with the existence of a camera. 

No. The module that controls the rate of charge and whether any charge is drawn from the power source and the AC power adapter resides in the iPhone, itself. As such, it's really not possible to "overcharge" a modern smartphone. 

The basis of most of the grass-fed claims I've heard are based on the fact that the natural grass-based diet in cows and other ruminants leads to a much higher level of Conjugated Linoleic Acids (CLAs) in the foods derived from them. So, two questions have to be addressed to this specific claim - 1) Is the CLA content (and other anti-oxidants if you want to address broader claims) higher in grass-fed beef? 2) Are there any health benefits to higher CLA intake? A review of fatty acid profiles and antioxidant content in grass-fed and grain-fed beef 

LiveScience: How To Make the Perfect Snowball This concept obviously applies to larger snowballs as well, which are the foundation of my "snowmen" scenario. 

(Wish I could down-vote Mayo Clinic for using "aggravating" on their web site like that). Mayo Clinic: Eyestrain complications As one ages, like with many other types of tissues in the body, the lens of the eye becomes less flexible/more rigid, making it more difficult to manipulate for focus. This would speed the onset of and increase the frequency of eye strain, as the muscles have to work harder. This is why people (like me, who avoided glasses for almost 50 years) need reading glasses more often as they age.
