Stop playing the office politics games with them and ignore this whole "evidence" thing. Focus on your projects/tasks and report often to your manager. You are talking to your manager at least once a day right? If you hear more of this gossip, bring it up with your direct manager. She/He will know what to do. Ultimately your manager is the one that knows how you are doing and is the one that matters when it comes time for performance reviews. If someone above them thinks you aren't doing your job then they'll first talk to your manager. That will set things right. 

If it's not 100% relevant to the position then don't bring it up. For software jobs, the Research Assistant portion is as long as you keep it focused on the problems you were solving. Things that led to your undergrad study aren't relevant. If you worked on a project in college that deals with challenges you might face at this new job, then bring those up. However if all you want to say is "I decided to take Intro to Comp Sci because my cousin said that Java coding is fun" - then leave it out as that has zero bearing on whether you are qualified for the job or not. From that perspective, it doesn't matter if you go forwards or backwards. What matters is whether you are giving the relevant information to the reviewer so that they can make an informed decision. 

Given the other info here, I'd say you are applying for the wrong jobs. You aren't a real Systems Engineer so you should do a bit of research to find out what your title should be and use that. 

Basically, it's a letter signed by someone you've worked for which says nice things about you. The entire purpose of the letter is to prove that at least one person in this world believes you are not a complete scumbag. Beyond that it really proves nothing. A letter for academia is worded slightly differently although it ultimately serves the same purpose - to show that at least one peer thinks well enough of you to associate their name with you. The difference between a letter written by a professional acquaintance and a friend/family member writing one is that the family/friend letters are even more meaningless. 

You need to talk to a lawyer. Laws surrounding the ability to enforce a non-compete agreement vary by state and country. Where I'm at the state supreme court has ruled them as essentially unenforceable unless there is corresponding "consideration" for signing. Appropriate consideration here does not include the actual job itself or even being privy to confidential information. From what I've seen about the only thing that passes muster is if the company is offering you some form of compensation above and beyond the normal pay and that it is tagged as such. Regarding "triggering" a non-compete I'm not exactly sure what you mean by that. You either have an agreement or you don't. If you do then it is obviously in force the moment you leave, the company doesn't have to do anything. They just let the lawyers sue you and the target company when they find out where you went. Believe me, they will. I will say that it if this agreement is enforceable at your location then you should inform the new company about it prior to accepting their offer. The likelihood of the new company continuing to hire you would then be remote. However if you don't inform them then you are opening yourself to a whole can of lawsuits and other troubles from everyone. Regardless, you need to talk to an attorney as soon as possible. EDIT From the comments, it sounds like it is likely enforceable - to be clear I'm not a lawyer so you should seek appropriate counsel. Assuming it is then I would first contact this competitor and verify they are hiring. During that process I would tell them about the non-compete and let them know my plans to have the current company throw it away. See where that takes you. If you have a job offer - likely contingent on the outcome of the non-compete, then approach HR / your manager at your current company and state your intentions. You must get a release from the non-compete in writing - verbal assurances are NOT enough no matter who else is in the room. Assuming they do this, then you're good. If they don't then you need to inform the new company that you were unable to get a release - which will most likely cause them to terminate the offer. Even if they don't then you have to decline. Either way you will have burnt your bridge with the current company so expect to have a bit of R&R. 

You've done everything right. I've been in a similar situation as an IT professional. Asked for time off well in advance with the request confirmed and approved by management. I even reminded them a few days before hand with an all clear. Day comes and goes, management pitches a toddler style fit that I was gone. I'm not sure why some people are like this. Best advice I can think of for you is to remember this later so you can be a much better manager than her. 

Assuming they offer you a job, at the end of the day only you can determine if the offer is acceptable or not. If you want $70k and they offer less, then let them know at the time of the offer, that less won't work. The only "trick" is in whether you will walk away from an offer that doesn't meet your requirements. You don't need to play games here. Sometimes I've overstated what I was looking for, sometimes I've simply given them a number and refused to accept anything less. Both ways can work but you have to be willing to walk away. The moment you become desperate is the moment you lose all control over the situation. 

I think you need to define what you mean by "hack". I'd say any hack that might result in a ban from that game world when detected would probably be something you kept to yourself. I'm with @Jane S in that I'd bin the resume for the exact same reasons she mentioned, plus the ethical ones. However, if by "hack" you are talking about something allowable by the ToS (exa: skinning a MMO client) then I'd only mention it if that skill were relevant to the job you are seeking. 

If you mean frustration at the jarring difference between having very specific tasks you need to perform versus being allowed to just forge your own path as the data takes you - then absolutely. "Real life" is far different from academia because it is results orientated and usually adverse to experimentation. Managers of software teams prefer going with what works, not what could possibly work given 6 months to 3 years of trying things out... If you mean frustration at realizing not everyone went to university - then that's just something you need to get over. A rather large percentage of the best software engineers either don't have a degree or got it in something else. You'll find if you start waiving the degree around as a reason why you are Right(tm) or Should Be Listened To(tm) that you'll be ignored. The best software engineers I've ever run into are some of the most cut throat, no BS, get to the point right now type of people that really don't believe you know anything, regardless of what piece of paper you might be holding, until you can prove to them you're not a moron. That proof comes from your actions and ideas. 

I've hired/fired people and I've been fired myself: a couple times actually. One of the ways in which we, as humans, learn is through failure. Sure, you can do the right thing 100 times and not learn a single thing. But when you fail once then you've learned something: you've learned that that didn't work and it's time to try something else. Being fired can be an eye opener. Most people want to do a good job and if they can't then they are likely to be unhappy as well which has it's own issues. Helping them make the decision to move on can be a positive change in their life. Whether they realize it at the time or not. Regarding cause, well, if anyone knew why some people were incompetent and how to fix that then they'd likely be super rich...or burned at the stake; I'm not sure which. The best you can do is try to help them out. Show them the way by doing things like using those code reviews you don't like to positive effect. Just remember, "some men you just can't reach..."
