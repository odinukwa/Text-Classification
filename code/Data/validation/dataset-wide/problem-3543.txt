Without inflation you miss out on these benefits. The first benefit might not seem like a big deal if you think you can simply set the rate of inflation at zero percent. But it is very hard to hold inflation constant at some target level so attempting to hit zero inflation will almost certainly result in occasional lapses into deflation, with the attendant negative economic consequences. 

Suppose the marginal cost is constant and equal to $c$, that fixed costs are $K>0$, and that revenue is $R(q)$. You seem to understand that MR=MC must be true for profits to be maximized: $R'(q)=c$. We also know that average costs are given by $AC=(K+qc)/q$. But note that $AC=(K+qc)/q>c=MC$. Thus, when profits are maximized we have $AC>MC=R'(q)$. So it is not true that $AC=MC$ when profits are maximized in this example. We can conclude that $AC=MC=R'(q)$ holds only in certain special cases. 

FooBar is quite right that unless you expect GDP growth to stop, fixed nominal supply currencies will lead to deflation. A moderate degree of currency inflation serves a number of useful functions in the economy. The most obvious are: 

This is more of an elaboration of The Almighty Bob's answer: It is true that if we start from a competitive market (i.e. large numbers of buyers and sellers), then granting market power to sellers (e.g. workers) by allowing the formation of a monopolistic cartel is bad for efficiency. Those sellers will use their market power to increase the price (and reduce the quantity traded), resulting in a deadweight loss. Thus, we tend to look suspiciously upon practices that create market power. Note that here, the policy intervention we have in mind is to break up the cartel and return us to a competitive world. Why should the labour market be viewed differently? Part of the answer is that the relevant counterfactual has changed. Begin with a world without labour unions. The market will then typically not be competitive because there are often a small number of employers who themselves enjoy market power. Just as a monopolist seller can drive up the price, these monopsonistic (or oligopsonistic) buyers of labour can use their power to drive down the price. Now we are faced with the following policy problem: 

If you are fairly confident that your current price is not too far from the real profit-maximising price then there is little loss in accuracy from assuming the demand curve to be locally linear (i.e. a straight line in the area around your current point). This is illustrated in the figure below: note how the red (linear) approximation to the curve much more closely follows the shape of the curve when the two endpoints are close together than when they are far apart. 

I would point you firstly to work pioneered by the late Gary Becker on applying the principles of economic optimisation to non-market behaviour. Becker's insight was that the kinds of trade-offs people face when trading goods and services also affect many other kinds of decisions, including things such as criminal behaviour or marriage and family life. For example, Becker modelled criminals as deciding what crimes to commit based on an evaluation of the costs (if caught) against the benefits flowing from the crime's proceeds (whether material or psychological). A list of Becker's papers can be found on Repec. Becker's style of applying economics to such topics has been influential and there are now huge literatures applying economics to social behaviour of every variety—to the extent that it is hard to even know where to begin summarising such literatures. At the time of Becker's death, many leading economists wrote articles summarising his impact on the field of economics. 

Rather than write a complete answer, I am going to post a couple of hints that will hopefully get you underway. 

The Bertrand case you mention is a little special because it induces a discontinuity in the demand function. Suppose that market demand is $D(P)=1-P$, zero marginal cost, and that all consumers buy from the low priced firm (and split equally in the event of a tie). If the two firms try to collude around a price $p=0.5$ (with quantity $0.25$ each) then each firm's demand curve will look like this: 

This is related to the observation made by MH.Q: if A and B are two equivalent jobs, but A pays more then everyone would rather work in A than B. This results in a shortage of labour in B and/or an excess of labour in A so that the wages converge by natural market forces and the wage gap disappears. Most of the rest of the chapter is spent discussing reasons why we might diverge from this ideal of uniform wages. The need to compensate skilled workers for the cost of their education and for the chance that they will not be successful in their chosen profession, for example, are offered as key reasons why wages might differ. I recommend you take a look at the chapter to get a handle on Smith's thinking. This reasoning still forms part of our understanding of the modern labour market: if the wage premium for a job is not sufficient to compensate a worker for the (opportunity) cost of training to do that job then workers will not become trained and there will be a shortage of labour in the industry. This will drive up prices by natural market forces. More generally, we now understand that wage differentials are an important means by which the market informs participants about how they should act. An extremely talented person who could, in principle, tranin to perform any of a large range of difficult jobs has no way to know where society needs his/her talents most. But the market provides this information by providing a mechanism for prices (i.e. wages) to increase in areas where skilled workers are short relative to prices in areas where workers are plentiful. The true beauty of this market mechanism is that is simultaneously provides information about the needs for workers, and provides the incentives for workers to enter the appropriate industries. Whatever problems the wage gap might cause in the economy, they must be weighed against the large efficiency gains that come from allocated talent where it is needed most. 

estimate a simulatenous equation model that accounts for both supply and demand. You can read about simultaneous equation models in a good econometrics textbook or, for example, in Dan McFadden's lecture notes. work in a context where you know either the supply or the demand curve are fixed. If you know the supply curve didn't move then any change in price or quantity must have come from a shift in demand and you know that all of your data points lie on (and characterise) the supply curve. The converse is true if you that the demand curve did not move. 

Since this kind of analysis is standard, it makes sense to think of the case in which a monopolist reduces consumer surplus and welfare as being a kind of 'default' and instead ask "when might a monopolist be desirable"? Here are some situations in which having a monopolist might be better than having very intense competition: 

Suppose there are two countries: $A$ and $B$. $A$ is a large, stable, democratic country with its own currency, the dollar. $B$ does not have its own currency. All prices and financial transactions in $B$ use the dollar and $B$'s citizens have a positive quantity of dollars that they hold domestically. Country $B$ has a monopoly retail bank that is required to hold 5% of the value of its deposits as reserves in the safe keeping of an independent central bank, also located and controlled within $B$. My question is: does this suffice for the bank in country $B$ to practice fractional reserve banking? If so, am I correct in thinking that the bank in country $B$ is exerting an externality on the people of country $A$ by devaluing their currency every time it creates a new loan? Is there anything that $A$ can do to prevent this? 

Now, suppose a monopolist has constant marginal cost $c\geqslant0$ (and no fixed cost). It's profit is $$q(p-c)=p^{-\epsilon}(p-c).$$ The effect on the firm's profits of a small increase in its price is $$\frac{d}{d p}p^{-\epsilon}(p-c)=p^{-\epsilon -1} [c \epsilon -p\epsilon+p].$$ Now we can answer the question: if $\epsilon<1$ then $c \epsilon -p\epsilon+p$ is definitely positive for every $p$. That means, no matter how high the price is, the firm would still like to increase the price further—the optimal price is $+\infty$! 

Since joining the Euro, Spain has experience large capital inflows—money flowing into Spain, mostly from Northern Europe. These inflows caused a boom in investment, coupled with an increase in prices of virtually everything (including labor) relative to other Eurozone countries. One consequence of this is that the recession in Spain has been exacerbated by the fact that high costs of production (especially high labor costs) made the Spanish economy less competitive so that the country wasn't able to rely on exports to substitute for the reduced domestic demand. In order to remedy this situation, Spain needs to become more competitive (i.e. for labor costs to fall relative to those in other countries). Normally, this would happen automatically: as a country exports less, demand for its currency from importers (and hence the currency's value) falls so that its products become cheaper for foreigners. However, the fact that Spain is in the Eurozone means that it can't devalue its currency—it doesn't have one of its own! Instead, Spain must rely on 'internal devaluation', i.e. reducing the wages of its workers relative to those elsewhere in the Eurozone. This is problematic because workers are typically reluctant to accept a pay cut (so-called downward nominal rigidities). Thus, the way that the economy adjusts is to have a sufficiently large share of the workforce unemployed that people are prepared to accept jobs on significantly lower wage than they might have expected in the pre-recession years. It should be noted that this line of reasoning is not without controversy. For one, a significant share of macroeconomists do not believe the nominal rigidities story. 

edit: The above reasoning works if we take $\pi_1>\pi_2,\pi_3$ (with strict inequality). But what if the inequality is not strict? Suppose that $b_1<b_2<b_3$, and that $\pi_1=\pi_2>\pi_3,\Pr(p<b_1)$. Then it seems like $b_4=b_1+\epsilon$ must yield a lower winning probability than that enjoyed by player 2 for any positive $\epsilon$. indeed we would have $$\Pr(b_1+\epsilon\leq p<b_2)<\Pr(b_1\leq p<b_2)=\Pr(b_2\leq p<b_3).$$ Similarly, $b_4=b_2+\epsilon$ will yield a lower winning probability than that enjoyed by player 1 for any positive $\epsilon$. I think that, in equilibrium, this won't happen so I guess the result is fine. But it makes the proof seem a bit hand-wavey. 

Note that this approach works with observational as well as survey data. It has the advantage that much work has been done to understand exactly what can and cannot be inferred from a set of observed data—culminating in Afriat's theorem. A fairly neat introduction to this literature was written by the inimitable Hal Varian: "Revealed Preference". 

To understand the economics of auctions a little better, I'd recommend taking a look at "Auctions: Theory and Practice" by Paul Klemperer. This book has a number of advantages: 

Whilst not as foundational as, for example, the Slutsky equation, the condition on the Lerner index that a profit maximising firm with price $p$, cost $c$, and price elasticity of demand $\eta$ has $$\frac{p-c}{p}=-\frac{1}{\eta}$$ is an important equation in industrial organisation. This is not only an elegant formulation of the solution of the firm's problem, but it is also practically useful: 

Geometrically calculating the areas, you should find that 'the tunnel' and A+D+B both have area 3/8. 

Once we think of preferences as being over states rather than goods then it becomes easy to incorporate the kinds of dynamic elements you refer to. For example, if I am choosing between watching a movie in the cinema today versus buying a blu-ray that is released tomorrow then the states could, in principle be quite complicated: 

The first key to understanding this is to recognise that consumers have preferences not over goods, but over states of the world. A "state" is a complete description of all factors that are relevant to a decision. For example, 

In most cases, thinking about these political and financial constraints makes it clear whether a subsidy should be used. Sometimes a combination of both is used. For example, in the UK the government both taxes petroleum consumption and subsidises electric car ownership. 

Roughly, people produce "stuff" by spending their time working (labour) and by employing machinery/tools/land/etc. (capital). If you have more workers or more machinery then it should not come as a surprise that more goods and services get produced. But this is only part of the story. Even if we divide by the number of people to get the size of the economy per-capita, we still find growth: 

Some areas of economics have more consensus and predictive power than others. Most economists would agree on the effects of trade barriers, could fairly accurately forecast the effects of a price change given a good demand estimate, would come to the same conclusion about the effects of allowing a merger between two large competing firms, know how asset prices will react to a change in interest rates, etc. The effect of a fiscal stimulus is one of the most complicated questions in economics because you are asking about the effect of stimulating a system with millions of moving parts (people and firms) and many dimensions (consumption/saving, employment/work, trade, investment, innovation, ...). This is a long way from the simple, closed systems for which natural science is able to give sharp predictions. In fact, when you look at parts of the natural sciences that deal with similar levels of systemic complexity, the overall (lack of) predictive power looks similar to that in economics: 

This observation can help you a little because it means you only need two data points to characterize the demand curve provided the price adjustments are small. Moreover, note that you can implement one large price change as a sequence of smaller changes. As soon as you have two datapoints, you can work out which direction you should be adjusting your price in. One procedure would be as follows: 

Edit: by no means definitive, but this article by Eliaz and Spiegler (2011) is a nice example of modelling consumers who are boundedly rational and do not consider all possible states. The title and abstract are as follows:
