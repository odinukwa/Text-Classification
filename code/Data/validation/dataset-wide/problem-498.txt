Huffy isn't one of those bike companies that has a "nice" well-organized** history, especially in light of its more-recent history: $URL$ So if it is a Huffy, no one at the company will likely be able to confirm it. Additionally, these weren't very (at all?) sought-after bikes so there won't be a user-group maintaining a serial number database (like some high-end brands). ** meaning not bought/sold/rebranded/in-name-only 

two cone wrenches (one on each side of the hub) to remove the jam nuts. This is the likely option. From your photo it looks like there is a flat spot on the jam nut. two hex wrenches (one on each side of the hub) that fit into the axle end. 

I'll add that anything hand tight will come loose fairly soon. As the knurled race loosens it will start to damage itself an/or the ball bearings and cause sloppy handling and steering. I'm not saying that you want to torque the race down to the fork, but up against the lock nut as @alex suggests: 

Unscrew what's left and epoxy it together apart from the internal workings. Buy a replacement cover. I couldn't find any online shops selling replacement covers, but a call to Shimano* will probably net you the exact piece you need. You'll need to know the model number which should be displayed somewhere and look like SL-xxxx. I can't imagine a new one will be more than $20. 

I'm not 100% certain how the DT Swiss centerlock works but it seems like its a way to attach a 6 bolt brake rotor to their hub. What may have happened is that since your center lock was lose: 

I have a frame I would like to get repainted. It is a composite of aluminum and carbon fiber (Al main triangle, carbon fiber seat/chain stays). The carbon fiber is unpainted (maybe a clear coat) and I'd like to keep it this way. 

But these require that the axle already be removed. So what is the proper way to remove these bearings? I know that I can just tap the axle out with a rubber mallet and force one of the bearings out, but I think this would damage the bearing. 

Not generally. Cyclists have points of contact - hands, feet, butt - where prolonged pressure is created. Pressure can cut off communication between nerves and the brain, making a body part or area feel numb. Something could happen with other areas, like the neck for example, if blood flow is impinged and the nerves don't receive oxygen. This is why wiggling things helps, keeps blood flowing and nerves firing. 

Wait patiently while you ride very slowly and safely past them until you either get their attention and they move over or until you are safely past. Get a louder audible signal, like an AirZound. Of course, this doesn't guarantee anything. Signal with your bell and pass them, accepting your fate. Start a public campaign to get the rules enforced. 

Without seeing the rim it's hard to tell exactly what is going on but I suspect you are in a loop where your rim surface got some rough spots which stuck to the brake pads which ground or pulled up some rough spots... and repeat. Since the brake pad change didn't work I'd suggest one of two courses of action. Or both courses but then you start losing track of the variables. Option 1 try different brake pads. The Koolstop salmon pads have a great reputation. Throw them on and see if they work. They are made of pretty hard material and they may accomplish what I outline below. Option 2 is work on your rims and once worked on use new brake pads on them. The work you need to do can be done with those green Scotch brand scrubby pads. You are going to use these to "machine" your sidewalls. Vigorous scrubbing around the circumference will smooth things out and remove trouble spots. You can go so far as to stuff the scrubby between the brake pad and sidewall and then ride 50 ft or so. Problem with that technique is that you only abrade the width of the brake pad so you miss some spots on the rim. Some people wet sand the sidewall with 220 or higher sandpaper. I would only do this if the scrubby doesn't work. The danger is manually machining the sidewalls is that you remove material. Remove enough material and the rim fails. Sometimes in spectacular fashion. Of course, grinding away with metal chunked brake pads also removes material so pick your poison! 

Disc brake hubs are dished almost equally left/right. You will want to make sure your road/touring rim is not an asymmetric rim, designed for dishing on one side and not the other. This Ritchey Girder is an example: 

I did this on a recent Al frame with the exact same problem. I bought a metal (steel) cable boss from the local bike builder and epoxied it myself. I used Loctite's Metal/Concrete epoxy since it's designed for: machinery, appliances, tools, lawnmowers, automotive components, pipes, embedding bolts and screws into metals, concrete or stone and sealing electrical components against moisture and vibration Although lots of other epoxies will probably work. If you do this be sure to read the instructions on the epoxy, clean the surfaces on both parts, and create a good clamp for the piece. It'll take 24 hours to dry fully and you aren't going to achieve good results by holding it with your hands. 

I am trying to learn the right way to remove bearings from a track hub. The bearings are cartridge bearings pressed into the hub. The axle has a ridge that prevents it from being removed while both bearings are in place. 

Seems like you have two options. I'm not sure this is your exact model but the broken piece should just unscrew. 

I've dented the rim on my Shimano WH-RS-10 rear wheel. I found the tech doc pdf. I've had wheels rebuilt before but always with rims that were available to consumers. I can't find any place that sells the Shimano rim, nipples, or spokes to rebuild this wheel. I know I can get close matches from other companies, but I'm looking for identical components to match the good front wheel I have. Does Shimano actually provide these components for sale? Would this be something my LBS could order? 

About mole grips or locking pliers for us in the US ($URL$ I've never found a pair that were large enough to do this. Also, you lose the hand feedback that regular pliers give you. You won't know when the race is about to slip until its too late. 

Tap tap tap tap tap. And then tap tap some more. If this is what I am thinking of you either tap the inside of the chainring from the non drive side. Or you tap the spindle from the drive side which should push the spindle through the chainring and bottom bracket. Or a little of both. Tap tap with a wood block. Greasing before install goes a long way to make these things easy. They are made to be tight! You could improvise a automotive gear puller but the hammer should work. 

Yes spacers are fine for this. It sounds like you want to move a few millimeters - 2 or 3 millimeters is fine and the bolts can handle it. A word of caution about bottom bracket spindle: make sure that your crank is clearing the chain stay. Inspect this under load. You might look and think you have enough room for the shorter BB but on your first ride you can put a few nice gouges in your chain stay when you put the hammer down. 

I know that the physics of disc brakes are different than rim brakes, but the differences are not intuitive to me so I want to double-check this. I understand that one fail point of single walled rims is the spoke hole; that they are prone to cracking. Will this tendency be exacerbated by a disc brake (compared to a rim brake)? FWIW, this is the front wheel I am thinking of. EDIT: if the answer to the question is no, what do I do with the various yes answers that I find? For example from Park Tool's website: 

With that in mind, a reason that most people don't ride that far forward is because moving yourself that far forward screws with the bicycle handling and puts you too far over the front wheel. Note that bikes that enable the most aero positions, like those pictured above, achieve the effect not by moving the saddle forward, but by moving the bottom bracket back. Now, with all that lecturing done, I would say that if you are dedicated to this experiment, you can get close with the profile seatpost mentioned and an ISM saddle. The ISM is an anatomical design with two points and a gap between. A lot of riders slide forward on that saddle and hook their sitbones on the two points. This is opposed to traditional time trial saddles which just had more padding on the nose meaning that sliding forward just jams that thing into you perineum. Even better is if you can start with a bike with a steeper seat tube. 1That is a bit of hyperbole, perhaps someone rides that far forward. 

Is it easy to sand blast just the Al part? If the carbon fiber gets sand blasted it will just get destroyed, right? What would happen if I used glass bead or plastic bead blasting? It should be no problem for a professional to repaint the Al. Simply mask off the carbon fiber and paint away, right? 

Since you have a relatively "flat" spot there (at least flat in the longitudinal direction) you have two options: 

I have some standard rims and I (accidentally) bought tubeless tires. As long as I use rim tape and a tube, can I run these tubeless tires? I know I won't be able to run low tire pressure. But if the tube holds all the pressure is there any danger of the bead unseating? 

I'm not certain, but the freehub body might be the same material as the hub shell (the adapter part). I've heard of the splines on freehub bodyies (from other manufactures) getting worn down, causing the cassette to wobble. In these cases, the freehub body was always soft aluminum. Inspection of the splines on both the freehub side and the centerlock side will tell you if they've been worn out. 

It looks like that Park tool is specifically designed for use on PF30 BB's (+1 for using the right tool). Just curious though, how do the bushings line up with the BB? What surface do they push against? If they push against the inner race, you may well have damaged the bearing. If they push against the outer race or the bearing cup you should be fine. The bearing (i.e. internal race) isn't designed for purely lateral loading. Are you certain that it didn't have any stiff spots before installation? You can try popping it out and free spinning it in your hand. If its still stiff outside the frame its certainly damaged. Even if you pressed the bearing cup in completely bass-akwards it shouldn't bind the bearing. The outer race and cup are thick enough that it would take serious damage/force to deform the outer shape of the bearing to cause any noticeable friction. To address one of the comments: If this is new it shouldn't have any stiff spots. Even the cheapest bearing should spin smoothly out of the box. Putting the crank on will change the inertia of the system and only make it harder to detect these spots.
