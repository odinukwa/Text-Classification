Some creature resembling (and extending the idea of) cephalopods like squids, or similar soft animals like a jellyfish or even a sponge. If they don't have complicated internal organs, a bullet will just pass through them, not doing much damage. However a melee weapon would be able to cut off its limbs and make the creature incapable of continuing combat. Even if the limbs would regenerate over time, a squid-like monster with all its limbs cut off would be helpless, and could be killed before the limbs regenerate (which realistically would take days or even weeks). Similarly, an exploding bullet will pass through a soft enough tissue without triggering the sensors to make it explode. This reminds me of a scene with Captain Nemo: The captain and his crew had to fight giant squids, and their guns were completely useless. They used air guns with shocking bullets. The kinetic energy of the bullets themselves would make them completely harmless even against a human target, but upon contact with the target, a strong electrical discharge would kill it. However, these bullets just passed through the squids and didn't trigger the electrical discharge. So they had to take up axes and chop at the limbs of the squids. 

Collapse of the economy, and possibly, of civilization. There are billions of people living in extreme poverty. Many of them would be happy to move to a better place. Imagine if from one day to the next, over a billion people would suddenly appear in the richest cities of the world. Look at the current migrant crisis, increase both the speed and the numbers by a factor of a thousand, and you can imagine the chaos which would ensue. Millions of starving people suddenly appearing in developed cities, and rioting as very few of them could find what they arrived for. 

Design a nanotechnological virus which infects everyone but remains dormant. The image will be just a trigger for the virus to activate and kill the host. 

I guess the biggest problem would be the production of reliable ammunition. People weren't using muzzle-loaders for five centuries because they were too stupid to realize that they could reload faster if they had a cartridge instead of loose gunpowder, they just didn't have any reliable means to ignite the powder. This means you would probably need a recipe for the chemicals required for a primer and for smokeless gunpowder. Would medieval people be able to produce them without having access to modern industrial infrastructure? 

Make magic illegal or highly regulated in your world. Therefore, only criminals will use magic. (and maybe some special law-enforcement forces created to fight them) 

Why are tanks and infantry still used on the battlefield, when artillery and missile launchers can shoot at much longer ranges and do much more damage? A wizard might be able to toss fireballs at great range, but if the fighter gets close enough, an unprepared wizard can become defenseless. Also, wizards might be in much smaller numbers, their services might be much more expensive, and they might need a long preparation time, fancy hand motions and all to cast a spell, when a quick punch or a quick arrow from a short distance might be quicker and more effective. If a wizard is physically more fragile than a fighter, and magic needs preparation time an fancy motions, even an average fighter can beat up a wizard in a melee.

Don't Use (Astrological) Periods So, as others have said, calendars are typically based on solar cycle or lunar cycle. Once you've got a year, you can chop that up (you don't have to have 12 months) into finer and finer pieces. Even the second and minute were initially defined as fractions of the solar day. Key to this is that the year repeats when the sun reaches the same point in the sky. It's periodic. Why not have a culture that tells time purely linearly, not cyclically? For example, in Star Trek, you have different planets with different orbital cycles, so why would Vulcan agree to a time system based on Earth's rotation around the Sun? Just find something that ticks off consistently (like Earthicans currently use a certain number of Cesium 133 vibrations) and start counting those off. Don't Use Any Periods Or, you could be totally fugazi and not even use a consistent time marker. Like a fanatical culture that measures time by the heartbeats of the Emperor. The rightful Emperor wears a (pre-industrial) chest monitor that wirelessly updates the Central Time Net or something. And everyone lives by that because he's the gd dmn freaking Emperor. If the Emperor gets nervous or excited, literally time speeds up for that empire. Yeah it seems stupid to us, but we just don't know how deeply the Emperor loves us (yet). You could also get Game of Thronesey and not really have constant seasons. Like, what is up with Summer and Winter lasting different numbers of years? That could also explain why cultures on the same planet would invest vastly different systems. Who Even Cares? Of course, you could also have a culture that lives on "island time," which is to say, they don't really pay much attention to time at all. Like, time is measured by how many spliffs you've smoke that morning. (Sounds good to me.) 

BONUS QUESTION: This page $URL$ says a man lived on coconuts from 1902 (and Wiki says he adopted a monodiet around 1905 or 1906) until imprisonment during WWI in Sept 1914, at which time he weighed 86 pounds. So, a while. 

I agree with @TrEs-2b basically. I also do not know of any examples of complete atavism but you can get pretty close. You asked if the wild-animal could evolve back into a humanoid "shape," and that is by definition what atavism is: phenotype not genotype. Fish to Mammal to Sea-Mammal to Land-Mammal Here's a non-homo example I think fits your idea. Whales and other sea mammals evolved from land mammals (which is where mammals first evolved, on land). Land animals (tetrapods) evolved from lobe-finned fishes, which are bony fishes. Whales look a lot like fishes but there are significant differences. Whales have lungs not gills and can't breathe underwater. Whales have hips and thigh bones, but they are small and don't grown into full rear limbs. Whales tailfins are horizontal, fish are vertical. So whales did not actually revert back to fish, but they sure look a lot like them. We could go one step further (for the sake of your question): sea mammals could start making forays back onto land! Now, being mammals, they have already solved a lot of the problems that the first land-dwellers had to overcome (like skin and eggs drying out). So for a sea mammal to become a re-evolved land mammal would actually be a bit easier, in theory! 

With sufficient funding we could (in theory) create self-sufficient colonies on Mars with currently available technology. It would have similar conditions as a Snowball Earth, with the added disadvantage of almost no atmosphere, much less water, and a very limited mass of materials we could ship there with rockets our technology is capable of building. This means that our species could survive, but depending on how slow or fast it was happening, and how united we became in the effort, the size of the population being supported could vary wildly. 

Cultural inertia, historical background, and the willingness of the biggest superpowers to maintain the status quo. There are several real world countries, which, although not "third greatest superpowers", have significantly more political influence than what their size would indicate. Exaggerating them a little, they could be good templates for such a superpower. 

A similar situation already happened. When Cortes conquered the Aztec empire, he only had a small group of technologically advanced troops, in most battles over 90% of his force was composed of native allies, who have chosen to rather be ruled by the Spanish than to become human sacrifices in Aztec rituals. To be successful, your modern army should ally themselves as soon as possible with a local power. The locals will provide the supply of food and the population base (and anything else needed to run a country, from policing to tax collection), and also the bulk of the army, fighting the enemy as they used to, and the modern troops will provide the fist which punches through the enemy. Therefore the losses could be minimized for the time travelers, and they could split up their forces to fight at multiple locations without risk. There is no other way if the time travelers intend to stay long (or indefinitely). Otherwise, every victory they win would be a Pyrrhic one, every man lost, and every single bullet fired would be an irreplaceable loss, while their enemies could replace any losses given enough time. However, allying themselves with a local power, or taking a side in an already existing war, they could certainly tip the scales and could make anyone they choose to be the winner. From now on, careful diplomacy could dictate what share of the victory they would be entitled to. As they have the force to be able to destroy any army and level any town, nobody would dare to double-cross them. 

Relativistic bag of sand. At the speeds spaceships fly, anything can cause great damage, especially if it flies very fast. Just take a look at how much damage a small fleck of paint can do to current day spacecraft. A bunch of sand fired at a significant fraction of light speed will be close to impossible to detect in time, and impossible to defend against with point defenses even if detected. By giving it some spread, you can even compensate small errors in accuracy. Imagine it like a huge space shotgun. Even if the enemy spaceship somehow survives a hit, it will be stripped of sensors, weapons and engines. It would be a very potent weapon especially at the few light-seconds range (Earth - Moon distance), but very dangerous even at much longer ranges, where the target must be constantly moving in random patterns to avoid it. Within the few light-seconds range, not even that would save the target, as its mass would prevent it from moving enough to avoid getting hit.
