Some context: $A$ is a generalized Cartan matrix, $\frak h_{\mathbb{R}}$ is a real form of the Cartan subalgebra in the Kac-Moody algebra associated to $A$ and finally $X$ is the Tits cone. Question: if one reads the proof given by Kac, it is written for $X$ and not $\overline{X}$. Is there a mistake or am I missing something here? 

This is not my area but a question occurred to me that I can not find the answer to. There is a very strong axiom of constructibility which ironically gives us highly non-constructive math (GCH is one of its implications). What would be an equally strong axiom in the opposite direction? And I mean direction in a philosophical sense, so what would be the strongest axiom that constructivists/intuitionists would approve of? My first idea was to find the largest $\kappa$ such that $2^{\aleph_0} = \aleph_{\kappa}$ is consistent with ZF but this set is unbounded ($\kappa$ can be any finite number) and $2^{\aleph_0} < \aleph_{\omega}$. Which brings up the question, how much fundamental difference are there between CH and $2^{\aleph_0} = \aleph_{118}$ for example? 

A GCM is square matrix $A = (a_{ij})$ satisfying: (1) $a_{ij} \in \mathbf{Z}$ (2) $a_{ii} = 2$ for all $i$. (3) $a_{ij} \leq 0$ for $i \neq j$. (4) $a_{ij} = 0$ iff $a_{ji} = 0$. There is a standard notion of irreducibility among GCMs and the common term for it is "indecomposable". Now if you look at most books there is a standard basic classification of GCMs: An indecomposable GCM is of 3 kinds: finite, affine and another category which can be described as all-other-GCMs-that-I-know-little-about-so-I-will-bundle-them-together. There is also another classification based on whether the GCM is "symmetrizable" or not (the finite and affine GCMs are symmetric and hence symmetrizable). What I am looking for is a smart classification of the GCMs that are not finite or affine. For example here is a number of questions: 

I am more or less in the same situation as you are. After careful consideration I decided that I should abandon academia for good. Because as far as I have seen your career in academia is very dependent on where you start out. If you do a postdoc in University of Nowhere the chances of getting a decent job after that will be even lower than it is now. There is a temptation to think that by hard work you can compensate for the bad start in your career, resist that temptation. As it stands now I will be applying for finance jobs later in summer. Consider applying to big traditional banks (J P Morgan, Chase Manhattan, Wells Fargo, ...) investment banks (Goldman-Sachs, Morgan Stanley) and big hedge funds (Renaissance Technologies, D E Shaw, Citadel). If you want more info about 2.5 years ago there was a small article in Notices on the transition from academia (specifically math) to finance. The author had a Ph.D. in number theory and went on working for D E Shaw (PDF): $URL$ Also don't worry about the state of financial firms. They have fully recovered from the effects of the great recession of 2007-2009: $URL$ 

I have a paperback 3rd edition and on page 65 you can find Proposition 5.8. My question is about part (c): 

The universal enveloping algebra of a Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ is isomorphic to the algebra of distributions on the Lie group $G$ with support at the identity. The proof I have of this fact uses the universal property of the universal enveloping algebra and hence it is not constructive. I was wondering if there is an explicit map? For example what would happen for $\mathfrak{g} = \mathfrak{sl}(2, \mathbf{C})$ and $G = SL(2, \mathbf{C})$? For an explicit monomial in $\mathscr{U} \ \left ( \mathfrak{sl}(2, \mathbf{C}) \right )$ can we write the corresponding distribution and how it acts on functions on $SL(2, \mathbf{C})$? 

And if not what is the simplest counterexample? A counterexample would be an infinite sequence of surfaces: $\{S_1, S_2, \cdots \}$ and infinite sequence of strictly increasing positive integers: $\{n_1, n_2, \cdots \}$ such that $S_i$ can not be embedded in $\mathbf{P}^{n_i}$. 

Unfortunately I have not been able to locate these two papers (internet, library, faculty). Any help with finding these two would be immensely appreciated. 

I am wondering what are the prerequisites for being a modern geometer? It seems that the amount you have to know is just huge: differential geometry, differential topology, algebraic topology, algebraic geometry, symplectic geometry, ... and then there is all kinds of overlap. So my question is the following: what should you know (from the topics I mentioned and the topics that I forgot) to call yourself a geometer (lets say by the time you get your Ph.D.)? And where are the best books/articles covering all that? 

Recently I was watching a talk: $URL$ and at the end the lecturer gave a correspondence (I was having trouble with subscripts so changed the notation a bit): $$ \mathfrak{Q} (\lambda, \mu) \Leftrightarrow \mathfrak{M} (\lambda, \mu)$$ Between Quiver varieties and slices of affine Grassmannian. I would like to learn how this exactly works (like precise definition of both objects is a start!). If you have the time and the patience you can post a lengthy response here or you could just point me towards the right place to start reading on my own. Thank you! 

I enjoyed The USSR Olympiad Problem Book: Selected Problems and Theorems of Elementary Mathematics by Shklarsky, Chentzov and Yaglom. 

I first saw an introduction to the deformations of associative algebras in the very nice paper of Braverman and Gaitsgory. I think it's a very good place to start. 

At a lower level then Hartshorne is the fantastic "Algebraic Curves" by Fulton. It's available on his website. 

This way we can study noncommutative geometry by studying the bounded derived category of the category of finitely generated modules over an algebra. In this way we can introduce interesting classes of algebras corresponding to interesting classes of commutative spaces. For example an algebra $A$ is called d Calabi-Yau if the d-th shift in $D^b(A)$ is a Serre functor, this then corresponds to open CY-varieties. This can then be extended to DG-algebras and $A_{\infty}$ algebras. A very nice paper covering these algebras, and thus to some extent this point of view of noncommutative algebraic geometry is the paper Calabi-Yau algebras by Ginzburg. 

I use "a legendre b" for the Legendre symbol. I know this is probably not very common and a bit idiosyncratic but I think it is quite clear. 

Hilbert schemes of points in the plane come up in representation theory. More specifically in the representation theory of rational Cherednik algebras. Rational Cherednik algebras, and more generally symplectic reflection algebras have a close connection with symplectic resolutions, algebraic combinatorics, integrable systems and more and are thus very interesting. See for example: This paper and This paper 

Recall that the (first) Weyl algebra over $\mathbb{C}$ is the algebra generated by $x,y$ with the relation $yx-xy=1$. It can be realized as the algebra of polynomial differential operators in 1 variable, i.e. $\mathbb{C}[x]$ is a faithful representation, where $x$ acts by multiplication by $x$ and $y$ acts by $\frac{\partial}{\partial x}$. In many places I've seen the q-Weyl algebra defined as the algebra generated by $x,y$ with relations yx-qxy=1, where q is some fixed nonzero scalar. This seems like a natural way to do it, and seems to be quite common. Now in the notes Introduction to representation theory Etingof et al. define an algebra which they call the q-Weyl algebra. This is the $\mathbb{C}$-algebra generated by $x,x^{-1},y,y^{-1}$ with the relations $xx^{-1} = x^{-1}x = 1$, $yy^{-1}= y^{-1}y = 1$ and $xy=qyx$ where q is some fixed nonzero scalar. My question then is: What is the reason for the name 'q-Weyl algebra' for the algebra defined by Etingof et al.? 

I second Kevin's suggestion of Huybrechts' book, but if you want to to look at something shorter first I recommend the notes by Hille and van den Bergh. 

It seems to me to be common that if one author (call her author A) contributes significantly less then the others, but still enough to warrant more than an acknowledgement, the paper will be attributed to the other authors (in the normal alphabetical order) with an appendix by author A. This seems to me to be a reasonable way of doing things, since first of all the normal alphabetical order is kept and secondly author A gets credit for her work. 

In the finite case at least, the answer is yes. It is a tensor category, and one fundamental result is that the category of representations of G is equivalent, as tensor categories, to the category of $\mathbb{C}G$-modules, where $\mathbb{C}G$ is the group algebra. The same holds if you just look at the finite dimensional representations, and finite dimensional modules if I remember correctly. As for considering it as a ring, the answer is also yes, if you allow formal combinations of them (so called virtual representations) (thanks for pointing that out Jose and Qiaochu!). It has a basis the irreducible representations, and the multiplication is the tensor product, with the trivial representation as 1. 

You can think of Cayley's theorem as the special case of Yoneda's lemma, where the category has only one object. If you take the additive version of Yoneda's lemma, and you plug in an additive category with one object then you get the desired statement for rings that's in Jack's answer. Viewing Cayley's theorem like this let's you generalize it to many other structures then groups. 

I was raised by a pack of wild mathematicians. We roamed the great planes proving theorems and conjecturing. 

I think that the best way to remember these things is to have a good example of each of these constructions in your head. If you remember the direction of the arrows for them, and if the example is "natural" enough the direction will be obvious, you will have the direction in the general case. Just watch out, sometimes two constructions will yield the same things in specific examples so you want to have examples that distinguish between the various notions. An example of this is that finite products and finite co-products have a habit of being the same in categories in which I search for examples (additive categories like categories of representations).
