Since white holes may be identical to black holes, this situation is exactly the same as if the planet was orbiting a black hole. 

Kevlar bones seem improbable. "Kevlar is synthesized in solution from the monomers 1,4-phenylene-diamine (para-phenylenediamine) and terephthaloyl chloride in a condensation reaction yielding hydrochloric acid as a byproduct. The result has liquid-crystalline behavior, and mechanical drawing orients the polymer chains in the fiber's direction. Hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA) was the solvent initially used for the polymerization, but for safety reasons, DuPont replaced it by a solution of N-methyl-pyrrolidone and calcium chloride." Lifeforms with a biochemistry similar those found in Earth's biosphere would have difficulty accommodating the hydrochloric acid by-product from its synthesis. Possibly organisms with an exotic biochemistry might be able to handle it safely. One of the main problems for any organism trying to grow kevlar is that it would have to consume large quantities of the monomers 1,4-phenylene-diamine (para-phenylenediamine) and terephthaloyl chloride needed for the polymerization to form kevlar. In our biosphere organisms only to access sufficient quantities of calcium compounds to make bones. If there was an environment where the base compounds were found in abundance, then it is conceivable that lifeforms capable of growing kevlar might develop and exist. They would be alien organisms with very exotic biochemistries. Unfortunately, this seems extremely unlikely. 

This is a matter of physics. Spinning structures to generate artificial works because of centrifugal forces. The 'gravity' is caused by the centrifugal forces pushing everything down towards the floor. Where the floor is the inner surface of parts of the structure moving outwards from the centre. The whole structure needs to move, to be spinning, to generate the centrifugal forces. In any part of the structure that isn't spinning, there will be no centrifugal forces and no artificial gravity. Therefore, if only a central mass is spinning, and the rest of the structure isn't, there won't be any artificial gravity in the non-spinning parts. Centrifugal gravity isn't real gravity because it is the result of the rotational motion of the spinning structure. It would be really nice if we could simply generate artificial gravity by spinning large masses. Unfortunately, nature decides gravity wasn't going to be like that. Spin sickness will not be eliminated because it still has to spin. 

Rapidly shifting fashions in the SF community of writers, critics, and readers means standards of what does and does not constitute hard SF means that Shaw's 1969 novel might be considered Hard SF today. This answer posits a difference between hard SF and Hard SF, where hard SF keeps a scientific attitude irrespective of its subject matter, while Hard SF stays close to science as it is known. The two explanations of hard SF and Hard SF below serve as illustrations. 

There are two possible Afterlives. One depends on the survival of the personality after death. The other depends on the existence of a Heaven or a Hell. This is inspired by Nigel Kneale's TV play The Stone Tape. Essentially the human personality is recorded at the moment of death by the surrounding environment. Under certain the recorded personality can be replayed. This means the post-mortem state is that of a sort of ghost. Whether this 'spectre' is a conscious entity or not is an open question. Considering that this 'recording' degrades over time, if you were conscious this could agonising. To get ourselves Heaven and/or Hell, we can start with the assumption that exists parallel realities which might be a form of parallel universe. For simplicity, let's call them a dimension. This dimension is closely bound to our spacetime and while they can only weakly interact with our sate of existence they can interact strongly with what might be the 'shadow aspects' of our nature. This consists of the pure information generated by the structure of our bodies and minds. Normally the 'shadow aspects' are firmly welded to the corporeal state of our bodies. However, on the moment of death the 'shadow aspects' can be plucked out of our world and taken into this parallel dimension or two. The 'shadow aspects' can be thought as the soul. This isn't accurate, but be that as it may, lots of people will think it so. While the 'shadow aspects' are intangible and immaterial in our world they become incarnated into something resembling physical reality in the other dimension(s). Should one dimension be a nice world, and the other not so nice and, if the truth be told, is downright nasty. Then between the two dimensions we now have a Heaven and Hell. Of course, the alien entities in charge of the two dimensions will be pursuing their own agendas which may be radically incompatible with that of mere mortals Now whether the survival of these 'spectres' in these dimensions of Heaven and Hell is eternal and unending, ie, whether they are immortal, is an open question. And the OP isn't asking about this. So we will leave the departed in their Afterlives and hope they can enjoy what is in store for them there. 

Partly it depends on how super-powered your super-powered individuals are, because if they're sufficiently powerful they can be mobilized rapidly and deployed to ameliorate the consequences of any major disaster. For example, if they can travel at hypersonic speed (either flight or teleportation or plain super-speed) and move mountains and change the courses of mighty rivers. But moving the injured and harmed by the thousands and provide medical aid to those thousands would be essential to their success. Changes to make this more believable. Drop the non-super-powered individuals coming in to assist the civil power (the police, paramedical, emergency services, disaster relief). They are interfering in civil matters if they came in the way described. They are a risk to themselves and to others. This is a corporation funded by toys, comics and memorabilia. Come on, this is a corporation they will charge massive fees for disaster relief. Their services, moving mountains of damage, charging the courses of mighty waste flows, and getting people to hospitals where they can be treated or safe refuges, will be vastly cheaper than the disaster relief services of almost anywhere on Earth. This applies to small, poorer nations that would have great difficulty to set up and maintain the level and depth of disaster relief services that an international organization composed of super-powered people can do. It will always be cheaper to pay the fees. The organization should stay out of criminal matters unless asked to do so by national governments and police forces. However, this should be done carefully as there are corrupt governments and this organization might find itself employed as an enforcement arm against political dissidents and other persons resisting oppressive regimes. If they did so, it should be confined to the jurisdictions concerned and stay within that nation's borders. It should stay out of politics and military matters obviously. Care needs to be exercised about which super-powered persons are deployed in which countries. This is similar to way Amnesty International works as people with backgrounds in specific countries aren't allowed to work on cases based in that country. For example, a person with Russian heritage doesn't deal with political prisoners in the Russian Federation. 

This based on one of three models for the formation of a future super-continent (in this case the introversion model). The subduction flux model led to this possible future supercontinent 

Reasons why this won't work by way of introduction As a person with a degree in the life sciences you do realise this could involve one or both of its parents storing their knowledge and memories in their germ cells and that somehow these memories are expressed and translated into knowledge and memory in the brain of their offspring. The density of information encoded into the spermatazoa and ovum would be massive. To say nothing of the potential harm caused by decryption errors into their offspring's brain. All of which would be prohibitive. So direct genetic transmission of knowledge and skills from one generation to the next is impossible. OK? A modest proposal for transmitting knowledge and skills reproductively Now let's do it another way. Through the reproductive process itself, but it's not reproduction as we know it. Assume the two parents do something when they reproduce that no respectable metazoan would ever consider doing, namely, their bodies fuse, soften and effectively liquefy as they and their organs form a single mass of living matter. Effectively this is a gigantic syncytium. Their child will be formed out of this somatic fusion, probably in a womblike cavity at the centre of this fused body, and it will inherit the recombined genetic material from both its parents, as if was normal dioecious reproduction, and imprinted on its brain will be the knowledge and memories of both of its parents. And all that epigenetic stuff that is becoming so fashionable in biology these days too. Once the child is sufficiently formed to be viable, the fused mass separates into the both of the two parents with their offspring between them. As a bonus offer, there's no reason why twins or other multiple births might not result from this from this reproduction by immersive fusion. There you are one great big gooey reproductive mechanism for the direct inheritance of memories and knowledge from one generation to the next. Naturally this reproductive mechanism will be produced by evolution, but how and why it evolved in the first place that's something for you to figure out. 

A size comparison might come in handy for starters. Firstly, the world's biggest submarines. Source: The world's biggest submarines. 

String theory has solutions that suggest there can be 10^500 universes each with own ensemble of physical laws. This is only one configuration for a multiverse (Vide @CortAmmon's answer for Max Tegmark's classification of multiverses.) However, the string theory multiverse does allow for a remarkably wide variety of universes. Many of which would have physical properties and laws quite different from those in our universe. This can include multiple time dimensions, more or less spatial dimensions, negative gravitation, different kinds of electric charge, different strengths of the four fundamental forces and other fundamental forces. It isn't know whether matter, for example, from one universe would retain its physical laws and behaviour if was in another universe where the physical laws were different or wherever it would behave like the matter in that universe. 

This prevents time-paradoxes from occurring basically because there are an infinite numbers of pathways events can work themselves out and preventing those events from being changed. So no matter what your characters do to their pasts they will still exist and the past will effectively remained unchanged. Dying in the attempt seems the most likely way for this to happen. There are other rather yucky ways it can go too. Like becoming your own father or mother depending on your gender. It doesn't bear thinking about. The take-home message is, unless you know time travel works in your fictional universe, then your characters are well advised not to tamper with their pasts. They might not like the results (assuming they survive). 

Even hundreds of millions of years in the future the Earth might still be in the Quaternary Ice Age which only started 2.6 million years ago. Currently we are in an intergalacial period. Anthropogenic warming will delay the onset of the next glacial phase for, possibly, another one hundred thousand years. Most likely this will only be a brief hiatus for the Quaternary Ice Age. It is useful to look at the history of the Ice Ages to understand what might happen hundreds of millions of years in the future with respect to glaciation. 

Higher density has problems because it means the planet will have a bizarre composition. Bizarre in the sense that it will be composed of improbable ratios of elements. Solid osmium planets, indeed! Not impossible, but their probability of their existence is almost laughable. OK, let's say one in 10^22 possible planets. Let's face it osmium is rare. A higher atomic number which means nucleosynthesis and supernovas don't make that much of the stuff. Besides the geochemistry of an osmium planet would be the stuff of nightmares. 

To improve their chances of survival it might best to place the children in small groups over a region where conditions are most hospitable for their survival. Placing ten thousand children in too small an area they will soon deplete its resources. They should be dispersed across an area where resources (food and the materials for tools, shelter and clothing) are abundant and their density is low enough that they don't consume those resources voraciously. Having enough resources with exhausting them too quickly will enable them to, hopefully, thrive and expand into the surrounding environments. The initial small groups should be bigger than one hundred and twenty or so. Say, one hundred and thirty and upwards because groups of this size have enough genetic diversity to obviate the dangers of inbreeding. This can be also be fixed by selecting test subjects with innate levels of high genetic diversity. Africans, for example, this does mean persons from the Dark Continent itself, have higher levels of genetic diversity than persons from the rest of planet Earth. A high percentage of test subjects who have an African heritage will guarantee this provision.
