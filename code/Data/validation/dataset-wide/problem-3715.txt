Trans fat only occurs naturally in a few food sources, and at very low levels (Health Canada). If a food is high in trans fat, the trans fat there on purpose (e.g. processed foods use trans fats to improve texture, increase shelf life, etc.). If a scientist's focus is saturated and unsaturated fat, and if food intake could be carefully controlled (such as in animal studies), they probably wouldn't include foods high in trans fat at all. For example, this study from 1990 compares soybean oil-based and lard-based rat food, neither of which contain trans fat. Even before we knew the health effects of trans fat, including it in one group but not another would be an obvious confounding factor. I would say any older animal or in vitro studies haven't lost any validity. Studies on humans have to be epidemiological for ethical reasons, so it's harder to control for trans fat (and a whole lot of other things), especially since many processed foods are high in both saturated and trans fat. Evidence from epidemiological studies is usually combined with animal and in vitro to support for conclusions about causation, so these findings are a little sketchy to start out with. This study re-evaluated a bunch of older epidemiological studies to better control for various confounding factors. It found no link between reducing saturated fat intake and reduced risk for heart disease and stroke in humans. So maybe saturated fats aren't damaging our bodies as actively as we once thought. From a practical standpoint though, even though saturated fats may not hurt your health, they are not thought to actively help it, whereas polyunsaturated fats are thought to decrease risk of heart disease and stroke (based on in vitro, animal, and epidemiological studies). If you increase your intake of polyunsaturated fats without decreasing your intake of saturated fats, you'll increase your total caloric intake, which would increase your risk of obesity and other associated health risks. So, even if saturated fat is benign, I would still argue that it makes sense to cut back on it to make more room in your diet for polyunsaturates. 

Stair Carry - The same dummy is placed into a carry chair (essentially a chair with rear wheels and grips), we lift it up (again two person lift) then go up and down 3 flights of stairs without lowering the chair I've been working on the basis that the lift for this is similar to the floor lift above (if you're at the feet end) so any advice you could give for the previous lift would probably suffice for that. However when lifting from the head end or when in the carrying position at the feet we are advised to tuck our elbows into our sides and keep your arms in a bicep curl position. Hopefully I can find a picture to illustrate all this more clearly. Therefore in addition to the squats to train my thighs and my above question about the lower legs, I think I have to put some effort into my arms too in order to keep the chair up (once it's off the floor and you're climbing, all the effort is in your arms rather than your legs). For general upper body strength I've been planning to do pushups and reading back it sounds like bicep curls could be a good idea too. Is there anything else that you think would help, or any assumptions that I've made and you can point out are completely wrong? I'd be very grateful for any help you can give me! 

Question: With the above plan can I still run marathon in a few years and maintain healthy joints? I don't mind if it takes longer to run in marathon, I'd like to know if above plan is feasible. Thank you 

People here asked about couch to 5k training twice or week, and I believe my situation is different. 

I have noticed after tennis matches, the athletes will wear coats even though they are sweating profusely. After heavy workout, I notice I need to wear heavy sweater, even though it is 90 degrees outside. Is this a good practice? What is the medical reason for this? 

Here's my routine Plyometrics 20 jumping jacks 40 ghost jump ropes (I don't use real rope) 60 jogging steps I interleave 4 sets of Plyometrics between three sets of weight-training. Lower calves are still slightly sore after two days (even when I walk I can feel the soreness), but I really want to get up and work out!!!!!!!! Is it safe for beginner to do so after lot of stretching, or is it better to wait another day? 

I wish to circumambulate around Mount Kailash on foot. This is roughly 33 miles of mountaineous terrain. Many people do this for spiritual reasons, i.e circumambulate once to wash away your sins, circumambulate 108 times to attain nirvana. I just want to circumambulate around Mount Kailash because I want to. What type of training do I require? I understand this can take years, even decades. Some information about me. 

Here are the nutrition facts of red and white quinoa from the same company. The main differences I can see are that red quinoa is slightly lower in total fat, marginally higher in sodium, fiber, sugar, and protein, vitamin E, riboflavin, and folate. Their amino acid profiles are pretty similar (they are both complete proteins). Just because red quinoa has less fat doesn't make it necessarily healthier (saturated and trans fats are the ones potentially implicated in health problems, and they're the same in both types of quinoa). Foods high in fiber and vitamins promote health, so red quinoa is slightly superior to white quinoa on those fronts. High sodium diets can increase risk of high blood pressure and high sugar diets can increase risk of diabetes, but even though red quinoa has slightly more of both, neither type of quinoa would be considered high in sodium or sugar. If you're a strict vegetarian, red quinoa would be a little better than white to help you meet your protein needs, but meat eaters generally have no trouble meeting their protein requirements. I'd say red quinoa is marginally healthier, but really, if you like white quinoa better, they're about the same. 

According to the Nutrition Textbook I have, there are only established AI's (adequate intake levels) for two particular types of fat: linoleic acid (an omega-6 fatty acid in nuts, seeds, soybean oil, safflower oil, and corn oil) and alpha-linolenic acid (an omega-3 fatty acid in soybean and flaxseed oil). The body can synthesize all the other types of fat it needs from these two. To make a long story short, omega-6 fatty acids are inflammatory and omega-3 fatty acids are anti-inflammatory, so they work together to keep the body in balance. Males aged 19-50 require 17g of linoleic fatty acid per day and females in the same age group require 12g/day. The respective values for alpha-linolenic acid is 1.6 and 1.1 g respectively. Since omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids work in opposition, it is important not to overconsume one and neglect the other. An optional guideline: according to the National Academy of Sciences Institute of Medicine Food and Nutrition Board, up to 10 percent of the AI for alpha-linolenic can be consumed as EPA and/or DHA, which are omega-3 fatty acids found in fish. DHA and EPA have more potent anti-inflammatory effects than alpha-linoleic acid, but they can be synthesized from it if needed. This doesn't mean you should try to cut out all other types of fat. Healthy, whole foods have a variety of fats and other nutrients in them. Fats also help lower glycemic index and carry vitamins. Certain diets, such as ketogenic diets (very low-carb), have higher requirements for fat-intake, so you should also look into diet-specific recommendations. Since the GDA for protein in a minimum and the GDA for fat is a maximum, I think it makes sense that the value for fat is more than protein. 

I'm not sure if I should post here, or on Hinduism forum, as it is Yoga and Power workout. I have been doing Surya Namaskar in the morning. I am comfortable at 30 rounds. But according to tradition, they say reach to 108. Just now, I read this article, $URL$ which touts the 108 repetitions. But I get confused with the following 

I wish to start Couch to 5k soon. Due to logistics, family, etc, I am confined to exercise in my apartment (at least till it warms up again) How to do couch to 5k standing in one place. I know how to jog in place, but how to walk and run in place? There must be a way. Couch to 5K 

They say do Dynamic Stretching before run. Will train for Couch to 5K. Is Surya Namaskar considered Dynamic Stretching? Or are there other Dynamic Stretches to do in addition to Surya Namaskar? 

perform 108 Sun Salutations in one sitting (takes an hour) ride on Stationary Bike at maximum tension (that I can tolerate) for about an hour jog in apartment for an hour max pushups I can do is 2 sets of three lift 5lb leg weights (various exercises, currently 2 sets of 3 reps) lift 8lb free weights (especially trying to strengthen deltoid) 

When you row, you do trunk and hip flexion, which are the ab-targeting motions of a sit-up; however, the resistance is in the opposite direction as in a sit-up. This means that you'll actually target the low back, glute muscles, and hamstrings (these muscles do hip and trunk extension--scroll down to below the "Thoracic, Lumbar" header for images). That said, according to this study, you do use your abs (rectus abdominus and obliques) at the very end of your rowing motion to slow down the trunk extension movement, so you do probably use them a little bit more than on other cardio machines. I wouldn't use it as an excuse to skip out of crunches though :) 

I couldn't find a site that actually explains these equations, but I can make some educated guess about the rationale behind them. The first term probably gives you a an estimate of body fat based on a couple circumference measurements. However, this estimate lacks precision and accuracy, so it needs to be corrected. The second term probably corrects for height (so that tall people don't get punished for have proportionate girths), and the last term is probably an experimentally-justified constant that corrects the result of the equation to it's as close as possible to actual body fat levels. If you check out the first term, you can see that waist and waist/hip measurements are used to estimate body fat of men and women respectively. This makes sense since these areas correspond to primary areas of fat deposition for each sex. You'll also notice that neck circumference is actually subtracted, so it makes sense that gaining more girth in your neck than your waist would cause a decrease in estimated body fat. I think neck circumference is being used to correct for your lean body mass so you don't get punished for having big muscles and bones. Maybe this is because necks don't usually have that much fat. The underlying assumption seems to be: if you have a larger neck girth, you have more muscle, bigger bones, etc., which shouldn't be counted as fat. If your neck circumference increases more than your waist circumference, the assumption is that the increase in your waist was due to muscle, not fat. If the method is accurate within 3%, it must work pretty well for most people, but there are obvious ways the results could be skewed. For example, if a male only did exercises that beefed up his neck without adding much muscle to his torso, the equation would probably underestimate his body fat. Or, if a female had muscular thighs, but a weaker upper body and neck (typical of runners and dancers), the equation might overestimate her body fat. People with uncharacteristic fat distribution would also have skewed results. 

Floor Lift - Lifting a 12.5 stone (80kg) dummy on a scoop stretcher up to say waist height and walking with it. This is done with a crew member at each end. I'm a bit concerned with this one as 80kg is 160% of my own weight, however with the equipment I'm sure it'll be manageable as even if I have the head end I should only be taking over a little over half the weight, correct? 

*with better manual handling technique than that! Anyway for this I've been assuming that as I'm starting in a squatted position then lifting up with bent knees I'll need to work on my thigh muscles. To this end I've been doing squats, is there anything else I could be doing? Would I need to work on my lower legs too? 

In a few months I'll have to do the standard lifting assessment for patient transport work in the UK. I'm only very slight myself so I'm looking to improve my lifting capabilities in the intervening months, unfortunately I don't have access to a gym so am very limited in the equipment I have access to. The assessment is in two parts and I'd like advice as to whether I'm working the right muscle groups: 

I just bought some push-up bars to give my wrists a break and was interested to see that the leaflet in it was keen to advise me that "it is very important to breathe normally whilst exercising - do not hold your breath". Apart from the obvious, why is this good advice? Does it affect the gain in muscle you get or is it just so you don't pass out? 

On the page linked above, they also suggest sports and activities to avoid, as well as activities that are good for people with lower back problems. 

If you want to estimate your body fat in order to assess health risk, it's also important to assess your fat distribution. For example, a high waist-to-hip ratio is related to increased health risk. 

It doesn't matter exactly what your arms and legs are doing in dead bug, as long as you do a variation that's easy enough that you can keep your low back pressed into the floor. With all else equal, I'd say the easiest option is to have one foot on the floor with the knee bent while the other one lowers (first option from the second video), because in that position, the bent leg helps support the neutral position of the pelvis. The medium option is to have one leg straight up above the hips while the other one lowers (second option from the second video), because the leg that is up is stacked straight above the pelvis so it doesn't contribute much forward-tilting torque to the pelvis. The hardest option is to have one knee bent at 90-90 while the other lowers (first video), because now both legs are contributing to forward-tilting torque on the pelvis. You have to keep the bent knee above the hips though, if you bring it in toward the chest you lose that torque. In any of these positions, only lower the leg down as far as you can keep the lower back pressed into the floor. If you can do all of these variations without arching your back at all, the next step up is to do exercises in which you lower both legs, such as this one. In this video they add another variation you can incorporate into dead bug with the head and shoulder lifted. This engages the upper abs, and helps keep the rib cage in a neutral position, which in turn prevents the low back from arching. 

I understand that one set of Surya Namaskar is a set of identical exercises, working the left and right sides of the body. So I guess someone can count one set of Surya Namaskar as two rounds, i.e. 

Help, I am really confused. Do they mean make 54 sets, i.e. 108 repetitions, or 108 sets? I am thinking they mean 54 sets (i.e. one set around the Sun), but now I'm not too sure. 

Please recommend more dynamic stretches that improve hip mobility. That will open up the hips. Also recommend other dynamic exercise for running, esp for couch to 5K. 

When I attempt to do this exercise with 8lbs, I can barely lift my right arm, and my right deltoid actually hurts. I can lift my left arm easily. How to strengthen the right deltoid so it is symmetrical to left deltoid? 

I wish to run simple marathons. Especially marathons that ring in New Year. Here is my physical activity so far (6+ days a week) 

I am training to circumumbulate Mount Kailash, 32 miles of mountain terrain nearly 18,000 feet above sea level. And I understand this will take years! Training is 5 days a week, Monday and Thursday are rest days. One of the exercises I am doing is backward lunge. I am at 4 reps, 1 set. For few days I was happy doing this exercise, now it is causing pain on right knee (started late yesterday morning). This morning when I woke up, I am unable to do this, or other bending exercises, including Surya Namaskar (I'm at 72 reps, 12 yoga poses each!) Now I have to wait a few days till I get better. Please give alternate exercise to Backward Lunge. Perhaps I can do this till my knees are strong enough to do both Backward and Forward Lunge. Thank you.
