Starting from a dead stop, am afraid it is a matter of leg and core strength and handling skills, which seems that you do not quite have yet. They will come with enough riding time. In the meantime you can try to get the bike in motion by pushing the road with your leg as when you push a skateboard or a kid's scooter, then turning the cranks will be easier. I do this a lot to start when I am in hard gears, not only uphill. If the slope is too steep it may not work, but if slope is too steep you might not be able to resume climbing unless you go down and then turn 180 degrees ti face the hill again. 

This is the kind of bike I would look for, that I think can give you more for your money: something from early 90's with an old shimano 105 group or similar, which provides reliable shifting and braking, steel frame that will still last a lot and not very heavy... these bikes are awesome... not too old to be overpriced as vintage, not so new that will still cost a lot, and really close to modern bike performance once you master downtube shifting. I bought a similar one for 140€ that I was very lucky to get, but I see them in the 200 - 300 € range, which is still a really great bike for the price. Now, for mountain bikes, it is another story, those have improved more with time, (suspension, disc brakes, smooth shifting under tension, whatnot ..)and I would go for a new one if I was interested in getting out to the trails. The bikes I mentioned are also easy to resell at the price you bought, so if you get into more serious riding you can always sell and get new one without losing much (which will not happen if you upgrade a lot) 

Once you've spent all that money, you'll have a complete mess of a frankenbike that doesn't work anywhere near as well as a proper DH bike. As Vorac commented, you're better off buying used. The Specialized Status is a good value place to start looking. With that said, an angle headset might help make the bike more confident on the descents, without completely ruining it. 

I don't know about the current Avid brakes, but Avids do have a reputation for being really difficult to bleed properly. The older levers also trapped air above the bleed port. For current Shimano brakes I use a syringe and push fluid through from the bottom to the top when bleeding them. 

Additionally, many forks offer a travel adjust option (e.g. Rockshox Dual Position and Fox TALAS). They tend to be big, stiff and relatively heavy forks which work best in their longer travel mode, but can be lowered in order to aid climbing up really steep ascents. However, they're far too heavy for XC racers. If you made them light enough for XC racing, they'd be too flexible for the more gravity-focussed riders. Additionally, the adjustable spring can have an effect of the suspension's sensitivity. They're a compromise. By the way, features such as Fox's CTD/ProPedal and Cane Creek's Climb Switch don't usually limit suspension travel. They firm up the shock's Compression (and in some cases Rebound) damping. This is to improve the pedalling efficiency of a longer-travel suspension design, in order to help with climbing, or riding on flatter, smoother terrain. They can still use all of the travel if they need to. The climb setting is a compromise. Those compromises aren't necessarily a bad thing though: They enable me to ride my 150mm travel 30lb bike up and down some of the craziest terrain you can imagine. It'll probalby never win an XC or DH race, but it's still a fantastic bike. 

Because I have had my feet sliding from the pedals indeed, and foud that the shape of this sole (possibly just one of the slots/carves on the sole, not two) does make my feet grip better to the pedal and does well to avoid sliding. I'm a student so I'm not wealthy, and I rather not buy some pedals and shoes just to check and see no real improvement. But what is more, I use the same bike to commute and to go on longer routes, and I don't see myself going to class or part time job with cycling shoes, or get the platform/cleat pedal combo. But I also wanted a jersey after those rides, to keep the cereal chocolate bars in the handy pockets, and the pants with cushion, and what is more, I wanted a better, lighter, shifters in brake levers, bike. I was / am, seriusly considering spending some of my savings in this, that is, in the full equip for a road cyclist, expecting to be able to ride at the other riders pace in an easier way. But I'm afraid that the main reason that I lagged and struggled was that I am just not as fit as them in regards to longer cycling. I live way uphill and daily climb some 6 km in 5-10 % steep, in town, and I usually go on longer routes (30-50 km) some evenings and weekends, but I reckon they are simply more fit. Now, thinking of buying a new road bike, I would be afraid of leaving it on the city street, so that implies keeping two bikes. For the new bike, I feel weird to get a 1500€ bike and equip it with platform pedals, so I should get clipless, and get shoes, and then, I feel like I have to buy also jersey and pants, and then I started thinking that this is a bit like internet explorer in windows, it goes bundled, you must go with cleats and spandex, because everyone else is doing so, so it must be better, but if it was not that significantly better it is a bit weird, at least to me to just wear this, maybe with a couple pockets on the side: 

In general, no, there is not a "a best suspension frame" (just as there is no best car, best breed of cat, or best person). There are loads of different suspension designs (single pivot, FSR, DW Link, Maestro, VPP, URT, iDrive, ABP, Switch, Pathlink, Droplink, to name only a few), each with their own distinct advantages and disadvantages. There are also a lot of different types of bike, aimed at different types of riding. What works for World Cup cross country might not work for downhill racing, at RedBull Rampage or even on trail bikes. They all make a different set of compromises. There are also a lot of different people with different riding styles, priorities and preferences. There's so much more too add into the equation, too (sizing and geometry, cockpit, wheel size and so on). So while there might be a best suspension frame design for a given rider on for a certain trail, there is no single suspension design that stands out above all others in all situations. Have a read of $URL$ which provides a good primer on the topic. 

Different brakes use different designs and different fluids, and as such have slightly different bleed kits and procedures. I've answered what I can below. 

Fit a proper DH fork (e.g. a Rockshox Boxxer) and a direct mount stem Bodge a longer stroke shock into the frame (if you can find a pull-shock that long) Now your head angle and bottom bracket are in a crazy place, fit an angle headset (Works Components or Cane Creek) and/or some offset shock bushings (e.g. Burgtec) to put them back somewhere vaguely sensible Fit some heavy duty wheels (e.g. Hope Pro2Evo + Stans FlowEX, or Mavic DeeMax) Remove the front derailleur, and replace it with a single chainring and a chain device Replace the cassette with a close ratio one and switch to a short-cage derailleur while you're at it Upgrade to 203mm disc rotors and Shimano Saint brakes 

It is not allowed by UCI rules, but comissars usually allow it if it is due to mechanical reasons and used to get back to the peloton, since they have discretional ability to decide. Time penalties or disqualification if used to gain advantage over the peloton. So, rule enforcement may vary depending on many circumstances, and I guess they don't want to lose stars like Froome, that could also be important when turning a blind eye on some minor issue 

I would say a saddle like the one pictured is comfy enough for 11 miles, but you can uglify the bike for comfiness sake, police will not fine you. And casual clothes would fit perfectly aestethically. 

A friends of mine just installed aero bars, we went for a 150 km ride. The aerobar advantages are mainly useful in flat terrain. If you have many uphill / downhill you will be using the side handles. And he reported shifting gears was quite annoying compared to brifter shifting. I wouldn't do it, it is for getting faster speed not for comfort or safety. Edit: I was thinking of the whole aero handlebar with shifters at the end and pushed forward saddle combination, which is expensive to have mounted. If it is only the bars, well, I don't know but it seems like a bit shoddy. Of course try it, since it is not as big an expense. 

Only with manufacturer-specific parts, and only with hubs that were designed to be adapted (e.g. you could probably adapt a 15mm bolt-thru hub to 9mm, but not the other way around). For example, Hope will sell you adaptors to let you use Pro 2 Evo hubs with these drop-outs: 

First thing to do is check all the pivot bolts are tight. If that doesn't fix it, figure out where the play is. Is it in the swingarm pivot, or the shock bushings? You can figure it out by holding onto each joint in turn and moving the swingarm. You shoukld be able to feel which part is loose. If it's been like it for a while, it might be all three points. Once you find the source of the problem, I guess you'll need to go to your local bike shop (or the place you got the bike - Decathlon?) and see if they're able to source the spare parts. Shock bushings should be easy enough to get, but I don't know about the pivot hardware. You'd need to open it up and have a look what's in there! 

Your bike uses a "high direct mount" front derailleur - so yes, you can upgrade to an X0, as long as it's a high direct mount model. SRAM and Shimano both sell "non-group" transmission and braking components, usually only to OEM customers (i.e. the bike manufacturers). This means they aren't in a "group" (e.g. X7, X9, XX1, Deore, SLX, XT, etc) but allow bike manufacturers to hit a certain price point. For instance I've got some brakes and hubs that're roughly equivalent to Shimano Deore components, but they're fairly plain looking, with only a Shimano logo on them. They're perfectly good parts - just not quite as high end / refined as as the ones that get the nice branding. 

Having such a limited amount of time for a group ride that in order to finish it on time you would need to push group speed up to a point where the ride is not enjoyable or even feasible 

Just estimating from the picture it could be late seventies early eighties I see similar bikes for sale at around 150 € With a bit of effort it coud be turned into a robust, efficient commuter, but it is not worth too much as antique. The frame is the best part, but equipping everything else new might get expensive. But the front wheel doesn't look that ruined, you could put new spokes. A thorough cleansing and lubing and new cables and that and the bike could go as it is. I'd put wider tires but that could be a problem with the fenders. Also old brakes like those can be weak, so that could prove a necessary change. 

There are organizations that offer riding in traffic classes, they even plan with you your best commute route, I would look into that as a way to gain confidence. Keep in mind that if you are afraid or you doubt at some intersection or maneouvre it can be dangerous if someone decides they don't want to wait for you to make your move. Confidence and paying attention to your environment is best for safety, which includes, as mentioned above, claiming all the lane for you. Practice and get proper confidence on your skills, get a good helmet,(I wouldn't go for the full closed hwlmet because in the tradeoff between visibility and increased face security I think it is better to have more visibility), see that your bike is in excellent riding condition, gears brakes, etc, make yourself seen without blinding other road users, that's it. And then, rememeber you can't be 100% safe on the bike, but just walking on the city is also dangerous, we have to go outside the womb 

In general, yes, different brands of mineral fluid are compatible (including the stuff used in Citroen cars). If you switch to another brand of mineral fluid, it's probably best to flush the brake entirely, rather than just bleeding. however, DOT fluid cannot be used in a Mineral fluid brake, and vice-versa. DOT will eat through the seals used in Mineral brakes. 

Put simply, a master of a craft will be better at it than a "jack of all trades". A dedicated cross country race bike will be better for XC racing than an All Mountain bike. The same would be true of the dedicated downhill race bike. An All Mountain bike strikes a compromise in the middle, making it a good choice for someone who wants to do a bit of everything. It's a bit more complex than that though, e.g. the Specialized Enduro makes different compromises to their Stumpjumper Evo. One is closer to the DH end of the spectrum, while the other is more of an XC/Trail machine. Cherouvim's answer points out some of the compromises (geometry, inefficiency, weight, flex, cost). Others include things like wheel size (XC racers might want a 29er, DH racers a 26er, and Enduro riders — who do a bit of both — might go for 27.5) and axle size (9mm QR is lighter but more flexible than 20mm thru). Which compromise you choose depends on what you want to ride! The "do everything" bike you describe would be complex and compromised, but it does exist:
