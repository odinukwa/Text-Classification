This and the Argonian are surprisingly the only two of this series that I could see that involve the evolution of bipedality. Whether digitigrade ("furry style") or plantigrade (human style), the important thing about bipedal locomotion is that it requires a massive overhaul of the entire body structure, in evolutionary terms. Let's consider the skeleton first. Obviously, what the legs connect to - the pelvis - must change, to support the changed leg position, and force from what was previously behind. That's a 90 degree change. Because of the extra weight borne, the legs themselves need to be made thicker, heavier and more muscular, while at the same time becoming more columnar - the weight of the whole body needs to be able to rest through a vertical pillar of bone, not a zig-zag, or standing will require constant work by muscles. The spine, which previously was a splendid cantilevered system, with head and tail balancing out the spine and creating a spring that could be used for great leaps and bounds, is now vertical, and under constant compressive stress - this requires bulking it up significantly, and making it far less flexible. The forelegs are now free to become more flexible, though for this to have any significant evolutionary advantage, there'd need to be something like brachiation (walking while holding to branches). The ribcage no longer ties running to breathing, as it won't be compressed at every step. The deep keel that ws once important no longer matters and instead a wider, flatter chest is better because it gives a wider grip and means you can cling to more stuff in an armload. The fixture of the skull to spine needs to rotate forwards 90 degrees to be supported by the spine, and since it is no longer providing a counterweight to the organs, it needs to be balanced atop the spine. Looking from side to side becomes a rotation rather than a flexing of the neck vertebrae, which means rebuilding them and reducing flexibility once again. Then there's the soft tissue. Sex, which used to be a simple matter, becomes complex, as genitals move around with the pelvis, and the legs start getting in the way, as do the new buttocks, which are required to make any kind of sitting comfortable (though the tail could be co-opted for this I guess), and for storing the massive muscles required to merely remain upright while walking. Internal organs, which used to be pleasantly supported by ligaments suspended from the spine, now sag downwards, causing prolapses. Muscles need to be moved around just to keep all that in place, but hernias still happen as stuff bursts through. The heart, which used to only have to pump blood up and down a few feet, now has to handle pressure differences of perhaps six feet, and the legs require a lot of blood for their newly-strenuous work. The brain becomes subject to blackouts when standing up, so various filters, gates, and pressure sponges need to be developed to prevent that. For all that to happen, there needs to me a MASSIVE evolutionary imperative to cause such large changes. There are various hypotheses about what happened to humans. Some claim that we just sat under trees and needed to be bipedal to reach up into branches, or hang from branches, etc. Others say it was to carry things, citing tool use. Others say it was because the hot midday sun caused us to become bipedal to reduce our surface area to the sun. My favorite, though I'm very biased, is that we went semiaquatic, and needed our hairlessness, blubber, and bipedality for wading and brachiating in flooded mangrove swamps. In fact, monkeys in such swamps tend to move around in exactly in this way. For the Argonians evolving in the swamps, then, bipedality can arguably make sense. But Khajiit are a harder problem... 

This may be the saddest inditement of how modern educational systems kill imagination that I have ever read. 

"Anything" is a big word. If you nuke it, will it let the blast through? The radiation? sunlight? Air? 

It seems, from the example, that they do not write in discs, but in arcs. That is, they don't really spiral in to reach the center. So I pondered: why would this work, and for whom? Eyes are a possible reason that it might make for a better form of writing: a species with differential focus/zoom (like an eagle, with the center of the eye very zoomed in, but the outer eye more wide-angle), and good peripheral vision, might find it easier to focus with its wide-angle view, especially if moving the eyes is strenuous. So, writing going in a circle around the periphery of its vision would be ideal. But what mechanism would create such a form of writing? What about a very stretchy latex-like tube, coarse on the inside but teflon-smooth on the outside? Thread it through the back of a large ring, and stretch the opening of the tube back over the ring, so it's wrapped around the ring. You can then read from, or write on, the part of the tube stretched out on the ring. Squeezing the tube that wrapped over behind the ring will pull more tube through, until eventually the whole tube is inside out - you then need to undo the operation to "rewind" the book. Or maybe just the page: whether to have a whole book on a single coil, or a book made of a sheaf of coils is up to you (or to the publisher). Sort of the difference between long old-world scrolls, and newer books with short pages. With one tube per page, this would end up looking not unlike the Incan Khipu knot-writing, but with far greater information-density, and obviously no knots (though a knot would work as a "spoiler" tag, you'd have to undo it before reading; and a knot sealed with a chop would work for privacy protection): 

In 2013, NASA estimated it had identified 95% of the potential "planet-killers" of 1km or more (about the same as the dinosaur-killer), and only 10% of those smaller than 300 meters. Tracking rocks appears easy, but there are many rocks that are visible to earth only by obscuring other things, or on close approaches to the sun. Even among those that have been detected, they aren't constantly tracked; their orbital paths are calculated once they're detected, then they are filed away and forgotten about until that orbit is due to become interesting again. That changes if there are things which might push them out of those predictable orbits. Even if 100% of dangerous objects were identified and were continuously tracked... solar sails are essentially mirrors, which makes them black to anything outside a very narrow angle, so they are undetectable other than in their effect on the rock. If the solar sail obscures the rock, or if the rock has been covered in carbon-black, then the rock will not be visible to telescopes either. So the whole system of falling-rock-detection currently on earth would need to be improved several thousandfold, to detect and track rocks far more constantly and aggressively than our current snapshot-based system. We could no longer rely on objects moving in predictable orbits, and no longer rely on passive image detection; a networked array of telescopes detecting stars being obscured, and using some form of active detection (very long distance radar?) for concealed rocks. Deflecting a rapidly-moving rock requires a whole lot more force than aiming; dropping a thing on a planet is a lot harder than it oughtta be, because it is likely to just get caught in an orbit instead of spiralling inwards, but still, the person aiming has the significant advantage of lead time. The closer it gets, the more force must be applied to deflect it, and I think the increase scales with 1/distance^2. There's also the shotgun problem: no matter how many rock-deflecting missiles you have in your armory, your foe only needs to send one more planet-destroying rock than that, in order to destroy your planet. Only one needs to get through. Have one large visible rock followed by a stream of smaller blackened ones hidden behind it. Have what appears to be one rock spread apart into many once the planet deploys deflection measures. Scatter larger high-albedo and smaller low-albedo rocks together in the same "shotgun blast", so that the glare from the shiny ones masks the stealthy ones until it's too late to deflect them. ...and so on. 

Magic does not mean invincible or immortal, unless you decide it does in your world. Magic carries its own risks. 

Let's start from the most obvious and basic pattern: a single type of animal spread over the planet. They are cannibalistic, and can photosynthesize, so there is no problem with it being a zero sum game; there're essentially infinite resources, but the only resources are sunlight, and eating each other. Simplistically, you can pretend that there are just two areas where evolutionary improvements can happen, the two we care about: fighting, and photosynthesis. If an evolutionary change can be developed which has a significant upside for one of these, but no significant downside for the other, you can assume all members of the population have that advantage (those that don't will basically die out). If a change confers a significant disadvantage and no advantage, assume no members of the population have it (those that develop it will die out). So the only evolutionary changes we are interested are those which improve one area, while reducing ability in the other. Over time, cooperative behavior will emerge. Herd members do not eat members of the herd, so only those on the outskirts of the herd are members of the constant battle for meat-resources, so everyone's average risk goes down; cooperation is adaptive, herds thrive. Herds can also cooperate as packs - a group attacking a singleton will typically win, and can then share the spoils. It is advantageous to the herd for those on the outside of the herd to be better fighters (defensively at least). It is advantageous for those on the inside to be better at photosynthesis (since they will never get to fight anyway). If the majority of the population is specialized towards photosynthesis, it is advantageous for some smaller herds to specialize in combat, to pick off and eat those wimpy herbivores with ease. So specialization cannot help but happen even in a homogeneous population with only two traits. If that's the case, then a pre-distinguished group with an infinitude of traits will just specialize faster. Even if you make cows and sheep truly omnivorous, they are never going to become hunters, and their efficiency at converting grass to energy will drop, possibly below the level of survivability. Equally, being a cat takes far higher energy resources than can be provided by simple harvesting of nuts and berries, so while an omnivorous cat might eat them if it sees them, it's more likely to try to eat the birds eating the berries instead; and the adaptations to allow it to eat berries might make it less able to catch, eat, and efficiently digest those birds.
