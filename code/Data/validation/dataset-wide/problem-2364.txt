With a scout group as a lad, we drove from Idaho to Miami, Fl. and back camping using these methods -- campgrounds, wide spots, side roads in National Forests. 

Keeping Dry We used tarps -- the blue woven plastic ones from Canadian Tire. Each pair of students or pair of staff were issued with one 10x12 tarp and one 8x10 tarp, and a bunch of light nylon rope. First night we taught them kids 6 ways to pitch a tarp, depending on anticipated weather and wind. Then senior boys would check the rigging of the newboys to see they hadn't done something silly like leave part of their ground tarp sticking out where all the drainage from the top tarp would drain onto it. Coupled with foam pads, kids generally stayed warm and dry. Most of the time there was nothing more serious than condensation where a bag was against the plastic. Now that said: We were in areas where fires were permitted. We cooked on wood, and most evenings built a drying fire. (Do not give me static about fires please. I took my nephew into Willmore last summer in August, the height of the tourist season. We saw 8 people, all on the last day, 3 hours from the trailhead. Most trips I've not seen anyone else.) This is country with LOTS of creek crossings -- at least one an hour, and on one notable stretch on Mumm pass, 57 crossings in 3 miles. Being well soaked from the knees down, and more than damp above, on a wet day was common. This meant that a cold wet expedition could stack the wood high to keep warm. Are you above timberline? Timberline is associated with two subfactors: Often little shelter from wind. No wood for a warming fire. One of our policies on any trip that had newboys, was that we camped below tree line. We did alpine camping with the seniors -- mostly, for them it was their third or fourth trip. They knew how to keep from getting wet. Reducing the consequences. Ok, you're wet, now what: 

Roald Amundsen, the arctic explorer, would stand by his open window without a shirt from the time he was 11 or 12. Myth or fact? Personal experience, living in a climate with big changes between summer and winter: The first cold days of winter seem bitter. At -10C I would have toque, mitts, polypro, windbraker. By winter's end this was mild, and I'd think nothing of going to get a sled of wood (100 m each way) in t-shirt. Either the Swiss or the Scandavavians did some research where they paid college students to sleep on a wooden deck above a glacier in fall with just a sheet. Temps were in the single digits by morning. My recollection of the report was that no-one got much sleep the first night or two. By night 3, their metabolism had ramped up enough that they were comfortable -- well as much as you can be sleeping on a wood deck. Can't find it now. That said: People who spent the first two years of their lives in hot climates tend to develop more sweat glands than do people in chilly climates. Sweat glands never completely shut down, so to some degree they never adapt as well. For reverse reasons, polar folk don't do well in humid tropical climates. I'm appalled at even the thought of a Toronto summer. So, yes I think being shivering cold does adapt you to a colder regime. 

The first gives a disincentive for a stranger to attack. The second gives you hope if the first is taken. 

If you are a person who burns readily then sunblock at all times plus long sleeve shirt and hat are your only answer. However the danger of sun, IMHO is overrated, compared to the other hazards of life. At one point I used the World Almanac for figures: Fatal skin cancers kill about 2 people per hundred thousand per year. So skin cancer has about the same risk as getting murdered in a civilized part of the world, or about 1/4 that of being murdered in the U.S. Given also that skin cancer risk is greatly increased if you have had even one serious sunburn, the risk seems to be associated with burning, not the exposure. If you are more comfortable without a shirt, do so. If you have a sensible prep plan for a couple months ahead of time, you can skip the sunblock. In passing: In 35 years of working outside and canoeing, I have ended up using sunblock on nose and ears, and occasionally full face at higher elevations. 

Some good answers here: Gotchas that can get the unready: A contour interval of 100 feet or 20 meters is common on mountain maps. Even a slope that shows an even gradient can have lots of stairsteps too big to handle on close inspection. It's easy to see cliffs from the bottom. Much harder to spot from above. Plan your down route while going up. Don't rely on being able to come down on the other side. One of the more frequent mountain formation process is the block thrust. This view looks north. Coming up the west side is a cakewalk. The east side is a bit tricky. Give yourself lots of time. Have a plan for loss of visibility, and/or lightning. Every few minutes turn around and look back the way you came. Have two means of navigation -- e.g paper map AND GPS. 

This isn't quite what you are looking for, but may be functional enough for your purpose. Padded ones are often used by photographers. In use, you commonly have them on your bum for walking, and slide around to the front for access. As another option, check out forester's vests. These are much like a photographer's vest, but with larger pockets. They usually come in eye searingly bright colours. Most forestry supply and safety supply stores. When I was a volunteer ski patrol we had waist packs. The pros had a larger pack, about a 25 liter day pack. I never noticed how they rode the chairlift with them. 

I backpack with my D7100 and an 18-200 mm zoom. It rides in a nylon camera bag -- just a cheap $20 buck one, that I spray with 2-3 coats of scotch guard water repellant. The strap that came with the camera bag isn't long enough. I made another one, and put a fleece pad on it so it doesn't chew my neck. I like the top of the camera bag to be just a little lower than my elbows. I carry an elastic strap -- about as stretchy as a bungie cord with compatible hooks. On rough trail where I'm using my hands a lot, this goes around me, under my pack and hooks to the camera bag. This keeps at hand in front of me. But most of the time when just on ordinary trail, my hands are folded on top of the camera bag, or thumbs are hooked into the straps. 

I had this issue on canoe trips. I would wear my life jacket over my poncho. Worked a treat. One of the things in my backpack is a bungie cord long enough to use as a belt. It has a bunch of uses in camp too, but fastening around a poncho works. One other easy mod for ponchos is to add some snaps or velcro tabs to make sleeves. Another thing I did with one poncho was to wrap it around me, and at waist level put gromets in the hem. This allowed a short chunk of parachute cord to link them together. 

I've had the opposite problem. My feet are very wide from decades of mocassin use. So my ideas might not work. 

There are certain other circumstances that cotton is fine in addition to the hot weather scenario. I pick up a couple of 'quilties' each fall. Cotton flannel outside, quilted dacron fiber inside. This is a nice combination when I'm working outside on my farm. Nice balance of wind resistance and warmth. I've used them on day trips snowshoeing. They are cheap, but they tear on sharp wood ends, and barbed wire fences. By the end of a year or two they are dog bedding. But I would never take them on an overnight. Get them wet and they are a real challenge to get dry. At home I either hang them on a hook by the wood stove, or chuck them in the dryer. Cotton gloves are the worst: A glove or mitten is almost always wet by the end of the day, or at least damp. It is very difficult to get the right balance of warmth and wind resistance. Hands go through a cycle of flushing with blood when you are cold, so their temp cycles too. When they are warm, they sweat, especially the palms. (Trick: apply antipersperant to your hands and soles of your feet to reduce the sweating and chilling issue)
