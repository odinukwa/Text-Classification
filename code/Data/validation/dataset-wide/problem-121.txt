If we borrow from mythology...$URL$ ...then your creature could be a large serpent. It has a head but is still infinite because it has swallowed its own tail. But is that satisfactory as "infinite" by definition? Sure, if inside it's mouth is a wormhole that extends the creatures length indefinitely. Or, what if your creature does NOT have a head, at least not in the traditional sense. Yours is a circular cylindrical creature that has eyes and mouths and ears all over its body. At any given point of its infinite length it can see, smell, hear, and bite. How was a creature like that born? Which end came out first? Well, you could leave up to myth and the readers imagination, OR the whole creature came out of its parent all at once, already circular in its shape. That's how its cells formed when it was in the womb of whatever birthed it. Or if this is fantasy setting then just magic it. As for it not being vulnerable... the creature could be so large that inhabitants of your world think its a mountain range. Any "earthquake" would destroy even an army of attackers. 

In this scenario do you consider plant life to be living things? If not, then maybe, MAYBE, all your creatures could be vegetarian and the plants would survive by living off of their own "circle of life". In other words there would be the plant cycle and your "living" creatures (people?) are basically a parasite off of the plants "circle of life". Otherwise I don't see how life can continue to exist without the exchange, if you will, of energy. If a creature disappears as soon as I kill it how can I eat it? p.s. is this a side effect of the infinity gauntlet? lol 

That's the problem right there. If MOST people have magic, then theirs is a society that doesn't need slaves. Slavery works when you have a large work force overwhelmed by a smaller number who have greater firepower, money, and/or technology. But if the enslaving force has greater fire power and greater technology and more money AND greater numbers the there's not much point. What would actually happen is that people without powers would become your worlds homeless. They would be worthless people who are cast aside pushed out of society. You need a reason why the magicians would need slaves: A) Make the magicians the ones who are fewer in number. B) bring down the magicians power levels (Example: They can raise a plant magically, but not an entire field of crops) so they're still powerful but not so much that they can do everything alone. C) Make it somewhat desirable to be under the magicians rule. Maybe the magicians are worshipped, or maybe being under a magicians rule offers some measure of protection or clout. D) Sex slaves? That there will always be a demand for. And as for why the magicians might want slaves...? To brag. A show of power and influence. Give your society a need for slaves. 

In Game of Thrones there are a bunch of guys called the Unsullied. Basically they're taken as little boys and their privates are removed. This is very extreme of course, but maybe your future society is kinda effed up this way. The Unsullied are some of the most fierce warriors in the GoT universe. I assume the thinking there was that if they didn't have "other urges" that they would devote themselves solely to practice and war. I imagine that a futuristic society might have more humane ways of doing the same. Chemical neutering. Mental conditioning. Its all messed up stuff, but I think you have go extreme to basically get rid off men's "horniness". The majority of us have self control, but not all of us... 

CHAOS! I recently saw a documentary (sorry I forget the name) where some astronomers were using long range telescopes, on Earth and in space, to see if they could determine whether or not there is in fact a large black hole at the center of our galaxy keeping everything together. By observing a specific area for a long time they were able to determine the orbits of several stars/solar systems, and they found that the stars, all in different, erratic orbits, were in fact circling something central; what they now presume is that supermassive black hole. What's my point? Stars move through space the same way that planets move through space in orbit around stars etc. etc. A Dyson Sphere (if it were even possible to build) would orbit right along with the star that its around, but a bridge between two Dyson Spheres would be pulled apart because the stars are moving in two separate orbits. The bridge would snap! Your web of bridges would be even worse. It would break apart into millions of pieces. And I think this would all happen fast too. As a matter of fact this movement between these astral bodies would prohibit you from being able to build such a thing in the first place. Imagine a spiders web where every point that the threads meet/connect is constantly moving in all sorts of different directions. In the case of the web it would become a tangled mess (because the strands are malleable and its all a relatively small structure). But in the case of your web of massive, intergalactic, hard, solid structures, it would be catastrophic chaos! I don't think I'm even exaggerating. Not to mention, building such a thing in the first place... The only substance that is abundant enough to be used as the building material might be dark matter and we cant even observe the stuff (outside of its gravitational pull)! So, that brings up an idea: Maybe your web should be made out of energy or dark matter. That's all hand wave of course, but its better than physical bridges across galaxies imo. p.s. since I brought up black holes, can you imagine what those and any large gravitational pulls would do to specific spots of your bridge/web?! The warping of space/time around such large structures?! Chaos! Good luck with you story/idea! 

The collision happened outside but the vibrations are happening inside the ship. The sound would travel through the air in your ship. Passengers would hear it. 

So I was reading this article recently, titled Stellar Outburst Brings Water Snow Line into View: $URL$ In short it’s about a protoplanetary accretion disc around a young star. The closer the disc is to the star the hotter it gets. But on the outside of the disc it can get cold enough for water/snow to collect. See the article for details. First of all, holy wow! Secondly, that gave me an idea for something similar to Larry Nivens Smoke Ring from his Integral Trees books. There must be an area of the accretion disc where the water/snow line is warm enough for the water to remain liquid, just between too hot and too cold. I know I’m stretching here and it would take all kinds of hand wave. The speed the disc is spinning at is probably too great to allow for it; The disc itself is probably too turbulent; All the stuff in it probably mixes up chaotically; It all gets pulled into the star; Radiation, etc. etc. But in the article it reads that the outer edge of the disc (the water/snow line) was as far away from its star as Pluto is from our sun. At that distance maybe the conditions of all that turbulence are lessened. Move that area in closer to the star, say to the goldilocks zone, and you might get a water/snow “zone/ring” that is warm enough and stable enough for the conditions I’m looking for. Could that band be large enough that creatures who could breathe water could live and swim around in it? Sub question: What with all that stuff in the disc being the matter that later creates life could life originate in that area? 

...Basically the cylinder that is the sun goes wider than the cylinder that is the planet. Both still cylinders. As for day night cycles Larry Niven solved that problem in Ringworld. I don't like his solution, but it works. Check it out. 

Sounds like you want to have a Groundhogs Day scenario without the consequences of what that is. If a day repeated itself then it would start over from the beginning point. All the progress that could happen would be the progress that happened in that day. That's it. No one in it could surpass that as they would also start over with the day. It's already a fantasy, but its even more fantasy that Bill Murray (Groundhogs Day) and Tom Cruise (The Edge of Tomorrow) are outside of that loop. Even allowing for that, the characters they play could only do as much as could get done in the time they have. For example if they have only 24 hours they still couldn't build advance an entire society in that time. You goal should be more manageable within the time loop you've created. But with every loop closing off nothing would carry over (except for the fantasy Murray/Cruise characters memory). 

I know an answer was already accepted, but here I go anyway: Regular updates! Every night, or whenever, there's an update that wipes the memories of the virtual people of any hint that their world isn't real. That's it. Simplicity at its finest. Big brother polices the thing with a fine tooth comb and allows for no funny business. 

Its in love with someone in the physical world, or its looking for a way to stay in the physical world without being hurt and cant find its answer in its own reality. Or both. But I dont think we should be writing your story for you. Motivations are what you should come up with. We should only answer the "how". 

Doesn't he look happy to be alive? Cheers! EDIT: I just wanted to come back and offer some better looking artwork. Your octo-humanoids might look like this: 

Although this does raise another concern... What is the shape of the shared atmosphere area, and does it leak out so badly that nothing could really cross between the two planets? Again, Thanks. 

If your story takes place in the future, the technology may be available to just have a 3D printer use biological material, cloned directly from your character, to print off a new arm. This is just taking existing technology to the next level. Nothing magical. Your story could even have the technology improve on the printed body part by making it "better, faster, stronger" (see what I did there?) so its as hard as machinery. Maybe the more BFS it is the more it looks mechanical. 

There are species of frogs that eat their young. There are crocodiles that eat their young. Of course that's not ALL they eat, and there would have to be at least some other forms of food for them (other creatures?). In your fantastic setting you could look at some of these critters that exist IRL and extrapolate. Larry Niven, Jerry Pournelle, and Steven Barnes wrote Legacy of Heorot about just such a scenario. Good book too. Edit: Maybe this is a solution(?), though it is most unpalatable (lol). Neanderthals and Homo Sapiens were different enough DNA-wise that one could argue it wasn't necessarily cannibalism if one ate the other. Maybe your creature splits into sub-species so they're not actually eating "each other"? 

Let me explain... you have a time traveler from the year 10,000. The traveler has a device that has all of recorded history up until 10,000 a.d. in it, like a text book to be read. If that traveler goes back in time and they make a change to time (say Hitler parents are killed before he's born) the device would reflect the change, right, and so would the travelers memory of events too, right? How could that be avoided? With handwave tech allowed what would be a mechanism by which changes could be made in time but the device and the travelers memory would remain as they were before they time travelled? I'm afraid the explanations I've come up with sound a little too "because I said so"; so I'm wondering if there is a Star Treky "tachyon-field" sounding thingamajig that would make for this allowance that maybe has some even remotely feasible reality behind it. More info: Many people in the year 10,000 have the "recorded time" devices and time travel is a regular matter of course in their time. They study to do it the same way that we go to college for a Masters or PhD. "What do you do for a living?" "Oh, I'm a time traveler." "Oh, how interesting!" It's more specialized than the average occupation of course, like becoming a brain surgeon or something. But could any of that work if they didn't have a baseline of time? I don't see how unless the device keeps things straight for them.
