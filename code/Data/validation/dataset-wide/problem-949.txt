Degrees of metamorphism are called metamorphic facies. This diagram shows at what depth and temperature a particular rock is formed. Igneous rocks are formed when a melt hardens to crystals and sedimentary rocks are formed from sediments. All rocks weather if exposed to water and air, and weathered material is transported by rivers to oceans where sandstone can be formed from the sand at the beach and shale from the finer sediments further away from the coast. Igneous rocks can be formed as hot magma intrudes the crust and slowly cools down and minerals are formed or form lava at volcanoes. This is known as the rock cycle and is one of the fundamental, but complicated, concepts in geology. You can read more about the rock cycle e.g. here to learn more about rock types and how they are formed. 

10mm a year is a huge volume when you multiply with lithosphere thickness and length of the boundary, but you are right - it's more complex than this. Melting is caused by the interplay of temperature, pressure and chemical composition. In the case of subduction of oceanic crust, it's the mainly the water that have been incorporated in seafloor that lowers the melting temperature and expands when reaching a the temperature and pressure of a critical depth. As it can only expand upwards, magma chambers are formed and eventually erupts as volcanos. The largest volumes of lava are however formed by other mechanisms. The volume of material is not directly related to the impact of the eruption, again the chemical composition is the main factor (Silica content in this case). 

Flow velocities from MEaSUREs (NASA), plotted from Quantarctica The ice velocity map shows, that some areas are unaffected by the flow towards the coast. Some of these areas are ice-free. Also at some inland locations, as Vostok, the velocity is very slow. Also, note that this is the surface velocity. At the base, the ice flows slower or not at all. To investigate the mass balance further, I recommended you to download Quantarctica and look closer at the datasets. Shepherd et al (2012) is a good first read about the methods used to estimate changes in ice mass and the present changes. 

Australia is a continent and Oceania is a region. Continents are vaguely defined as large landmasses separated by water or just by historical context. Earth scientists have much more precise definitions of what a continental plate is vs an oceanic plate. In the case of Australia, the continental plate consists of the landmasses Australia, Tasmania and New Guinea. Sometimes other names are used to clarify the difference between the country Australia and the continent. Oceania is the region of island nations and sometimes Australia, located in or near the Pacific Ocean. There are a number of different definitions depending on the context. Usually Oceania includes islands that have no affiliation with the Australian continent. 

Yes, they can. Hawaiian Trough is a good example. The impact on thin oceanic crust is naturally larger/faster than on stiff continental crust. Generally the lithosphere will always respond to load, even if it's sediments, ice or water. The process also works the other way, exhumation by erosion ease the load and cause uplift. 

Temperature gradient from crust to core. Recent research have improved the accuracy, but the principle in the figure remains (Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences, 24(1), 15–40) So why do you experience the temperature colder underground when you are digging? The temperature at depth is the average temperature for day and night or even the year. The energy from the sun reaches only the uppermost soil layer that absorbs heat but the thermal conductivity is relatively low and it will not transport the heat down. The ground is reluctant to change its temperature regardless of variations on the surface. How strongly you experience the temperature difference depends on where in the world you are and the local conditions. In some areas, the ground remains frozen, known as permafrost, even as the temperatures in the air can be pleasant during the summer and the surface layer melts. The depth of the suggests that it's been formed over a long time. It reaches down to the depth where the mean temperature over hundreds or thousands of years is 0°C. At larger depths, the heat from the Earth's interior takes over and melts the frost. 

Change in axial tilt over time from Laskar (1986) We cannot remove the tilt completely, but we can look at the constant axial tilt change in the Milankovitch cycles. Some believe that the impact of this 2.4° change is rather large. Clive Best blog gives the main arguments and suggests some good references. See also this discussion and this paper on tidal change and glaciation. However, it's difficult to specify how much of the impact that is directly related to the tilt change, as sea level change and glaciation also affects and interacts with the tides pattern. 

Even as the geologists of the time had a developed vocabulary for rock types and correlations, they still couldn't be sure that Antarctica was indeed one continent or two. As a side note, it should be mentioned that they are indeed right in the doubts. Today we know that East and West Antarctica have very different history and properties. See e.g. Boger (2011). 

I hope I understand your question right, I think there are some confusion about frequency range and wave-types. Seismic waves are acceleration of matter that transfer kinetic energy from a seismic source (e.g. an earthquake, an explosion or ambient noise) to heat. It's similar to sound waves, vibrations from the surface of e.g. a music instrument set the air in motion and compress the molecules of the air to transfer a wave that eventually reach e.g the eardrum. However, to add to the complexity, in solid matter some additional elastic properties are in play, as you notice. Waves can progress not only as pressure waves (P) but also as shear waves (S) and at boundaries special surface waves can form, often of high amplitude. The progression of the seismic waves depends on the elastic properties of the Earth. A large part of the terminology used for seismic waves are similar to how we describe electromagnetic waves. E.g. frequency, damping and resonance are relevant for seismic waves as well. However, the ranges are very different and electromagnetic waves and acoustic waves behaves different. The earth is a efficient filter, and even transient energy, that contains high frequencies, is limited to low frequencies as it progress through the Earth. Ground wave propagation, as know from radio signals, are different from the properties of seismic surface waves. An interesting coincidence is that wavelengths can be in the same magnitude, but that is because radio waves progress about 100.000 times faster than crustal seismic waves.
