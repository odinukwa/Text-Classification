Instead of telling people that those on the Torus will have a better life, you tell them the opposite. Tell them that there are too many people for Earth to sustain, and so as an attempt to alleviate some of the pressure you'll be sending 1% of the population to live on a space station where they'll have cramped quarters, crappy food, few entertainment options.... Basically, make it seem as though the 1% on the space station have a worse life than the 99% on Earth. 

Going off of the lore, the reason that they brought the slain to Valhalla was so that they could fight in Ragnarok. So it would make sense that they simply want to bring the best warriors, no matter which side they were on in a particular human conflict. Continuing on that train of thought for a while, an argument that seems believable would be that they choose to kill those warriors who have nothing more to learn from living on Earth - the only way they could become better fighters is by training in Valhalla until the end of time. TLDR politics don't matter that much when you're talking about building an army for the end of the world. 

They would not be as fast as the "normal-sized" versions. Long story short, they get hit with the downsides of the Square Cube Law. Let's talk chariots first. You're tripling the size of the riders, the chariot itself, and the wheels, which means you're effectively tripling the weight of the whole system. However, you aren't doing anything about the horses pulling the chariot. In order to apply the same amount of relative power, you'd need to triple the number of horses, at least - once you start adding in multiple horses you start losing efficiency. In addition, the wheels themselves would be at more risk of breaking due to their increased size - the stress on the wheels increases a lot with the increased weight. In order to deal with the increased stress, you'd need to make the wheels wider in addition to taller, but that means adding more weight in general. Net result: slower. Moving on to the boats. Honestly, I don't think that a classic Greek trireme would work at all in this universe. The triple-decked oar arrangement doesn't really work so well with the increased size requirements. If people get up to twenty feet tall, the ships would have to be massively bigger than they were in our history. And that's where the Square Cube Law really bites you. The ship is getting bigger in volume, and the sails/oars are getting bigger by area. As I'm writing this, @Zxyrra just posted their answer with some of the math behind the Square Cube Law, so I won't repeat the numbers. The end result is that you aren't able to get as much propulsion relative to the weight, leading to lower net speeds. It's kinda like how you can flick a pebble and it will fly through the air, but kicking a boulder doesn't move it at all. 

The thing with zero-g is that nobody realizes just how much we rely on gravity for combat. Punches won't be as effective as they are on Earth, since the puncher won't be able to brace themselves against the floor. Throws and flips won't be as effective, since the lack of gravity means they won't be smacked to the ground as hard - and even if they do, you don't get as much of a positioning advantage because you aren't able to immediately pin them to the ground, since you're still floating in zero-g. The most efficient way to deal with a melee combatant in zero-g will be to get them into a choke hold and knock them unconscious that way. Course, they'll be trying to do the same to you. Due to how you need something (floor, walls, ceiling) to move off of/change direction, physical size will matter even more than it does on Earth - the larger person will be able to dictate the movement of the fight more than the smaller person. @MozerShmozer has a good point in his answer (posted at the same time I'm writing this) regarding handholds for movement, but goes in the wrong direction with it, IMO. Since combat is basically devolving into grappling/wrestling, those handholds will be huge, but they won't make combat more familiar. They'll make it more exotic. The handholds will allow you to do all sorts of cartwheels, spins, and flips that would be impossible in normal gravity. Think of the hallway fight scene from Inception, only even more so (after all, there was still gravity there, it was just rotating). Jump toward the person and grab them, you both fly towards the wall. It looks like you're going to pin them to the wall because of the angle you jumped at. They reach down and grab a handhold on the floor. Suddenly you're flipping. They let go of the handhold. You keep flying toward the wall, but you're spinning. Now you're going to be the one who gets pinned to the wall, so you grab a handhold to the side. Now you're flipping towards the side wall instead of the back wall. They grab.... And of course, the whole time you're both trying to choke each other. What fun! 

It depends on how much damage to the planet is acceptable. If you're okay with banging it up a little bit (collateral damage is a thing, after all), but don't want to cause too much long-term damage, it would be pretty easy to bombard the major food production sources from orbit. Just imagine what dropping a few tungsten rods on Nebraska and Iowa would do to America's grain production. If you don't want to harm the planet at all, it's a bit trickier, but still doable. Remember that the key to a siege is making the besieged want to surrender. It's majorly an issue of morale, and food just tends to be one of the easiest ways to hurt an enemy's morale. It's easy to say that you'll fight to the death when the table is full, but it's much harder when you're trying to extend your last loaf of bread another day, when you're giving up your portion so that your child might survive. The battle of morale is a battle that you can fight constantly, even without trying. Never let the people on the planet forget that you're there; plan your ships' orbits so that there is always a ship in view of every major population center, and they can't look up without seeing you. Maybe you could drop a rock into an ocean, causing a tidal wave to crash into a city. Communications on such a short distance are easy, so send video of your crew eating, laughing, generally having a good time (with the implication being "Surrender and join us, and you can be happy too!"), and generally not living under the siege of an armada of spaceships. The entire time, though, you'll be wanting to watch out for the planet fighting back. You have spaceships, they have missiles that can reach space. If they're capable of space flight, you may need to destroy their shipyards so that they can't fight back as easily. That's really the big issue with a siege; you only besiege a place when you can't conquer it in an outright assault, so the planet must be about as advanced as you are. They will fight back, so at some point you'll have to ask yourself how much you're short-term damage you're willing to do to the planet. 

This is definitely realistic. What's actually interesting about this is that several of the issues you bring up sort of resolve each other. I'll go through them one by one. In order to have this happen, you would need less water on the planet than Earth does. So right off the bat, even if you had an enormous consolidated ocean it would be smaller than the oceans of Earth. So right off the bat, you're going to be having less of an effect from erosion. Coupled with evidence from Earth, namely the Caspian Sea - which is completely landlocked - it's quite possible to keep the water separated. There probably wouldn't be too much geologic activity. We currently think that large amounts of water are necessary for plate tectonics, that the plates formed by oceans leaving sediment until eventually the weight cracked Earth's crust. Since we don't have large oceans on your world, no plate tectonics, so less geologic activity. Similarly, since we don't have very much geologic activity, there probably won't be mesas. Mesas are formed through eroding rocks uplifted by tectonic activity, so there would be fewer than on Earth, if any at all. Speculation: One way I can see a planet like this developing is experiencing asteroid/meteorite impacts more frequently than Earth did. The way I see it, this would cause the planet to take longer to cool, meaning that the increased number of impacts would ultimately lead to a more pockmarked surface. When the planet does cool enough that liquid water can begin to build up, the craters would then become small seas. (Don't quote me on this part though, as I'm certainly no expert on planetary formation - I'm just extrapolating off what I know.) 

Alexandr Buturlin is not given command in 1760, and Empress Elizabeth of Russia doesn't die in 1762. Elizabeth's Russia entered the war mainly due to her dislike of Frederick the Great (Prussia, who was allied with England) and therefore was allied with France (and Austria, which is important). By all measurements, Russia/France/Austria were winning the war in Eastern Europe. At the beginning of 1760, Frederick the Great wrote that "I'm at the end of my resources... the continuance of this war means for me utter ruin." Things were looking good. Then two things happened. One, Alex Buturlin was appointed commander in chief of the Russian army, which was by all accounts a colossal screw-up. The Campaign of 1760 was a disaster for the Russian army, mainly due to Buturlin not pressing his initiative. Two, Russia and Austria signed a secret treaty in which they split up Prussia - Russia would annex East Prussia as reparations for the cost of the war. However, since it was secret (as it wasn't exactly good form to divide the spoils of war before the war was over) not many people knew about it. Then Elizabeth died childless and was succeeded by her nephew Peter III. Peter was a great admirer of Frederick the Great, and made peace with Prussia. This peace actually involved Russia switching sides in the war, and they soon marched on their Austrian former-allies. That forced Austria to the negotiating table with Prussia, and effectively ended the war in Eastern Europe, leaving France basically on their own. At that point it was pretty much the end in all but fact. This whole chain of events, from the mess-ups of the Campaign of 1760 to the death of Elizabeth (and her replacement with a Prussian-sympathetic Peter) is known as the Miracle of the House of Brandenburg. There is truthfully no reason why it should have played out the way it did, other than sheer luck and the idiosyncrasies of Russian succession law (Peter was actually German, hence his pro-Prussia attitude, but inherited a claim on Russia through his mother). If you remove the Miracle of the House of Brandenburg, Prussia falls in Eastern Europe. Suddenly it would be England on their own, not France, and they'd be facing a combined French-Russian-Austrian army. Fighting one vs three isn't particularly feasible. GG, France wins. As far as what England would give to France, they'd have no real choice but to give up their North American holdings - much of Canada and the Thirteen Colonies that became the USA. This was before major "colonization" of Africa and India took place, so there actually weren't many options for what England could have given up. They wouldn't have given anything to Russia/Austria, because they had already gotten their share of the spoils (Prussia divided between them, from earlier). They could perhaps get away with just giving France their holdings in Canada, and keeping the Thirteen Colonies, but that depends on how good their negotiators are. Ultimately, France remains a major power in the Americas and England doesn't become the global superpower that we know it as. 

Could such a species exist with conscious or subconscious mate selection, the ability to prefer use of the DNA of a specific male? 

How big would it have to be? Not very big. Radio waves are electromagnetic radiation, just like visible light. Assuming a focused signal, you'd need an opening about the size of a laser pointer. Maybe a bit bigger to ensure the message gets through. The rest of your questions.... Well, it's up to you. We have no observational evidence that wormholes actually exist, so you could make them have whatever properties you want. 

Better than survive, they'd thrive. The key here is that they are in the position of power. They have missile technology more than a decade more advanced than anyone else on the planet - as you said, they're comparable to what the US had in 1955, but that was with ten years of Nazi scientists helping them. So without their help, say that they're 15 years advanced. Neither the US or the USSR get Nazi scientists. So the resulting nuclear proliferation is much slower than it was in our universe. As a result, the Germans are able to subtly control things - Europe is small enough that they would basically be able to strong-arm anyone else into better trade deals, etc. The timing also plays in Germany's favor. November of 1944 is just a few months before the USSR captured Auschwitz. If the Allies don't capture Auschwitz, there won't be the same level of understanding of how awful the Holocaust was, meaning that worldwide opinion of the Nazi party won't be as bad as it became in our universe. The primary disadvantage that Germany has is that it doesn't have much land. The US and the USSR have a lot of open ground, which is good for having ICBM launch sites - you don't want your launch sites to be right next to your major cities, and the more land you have the more missiles you can have. Germany would not be able to keep up with the number of launch sites that the US and USSR could maintain (once their technology caught up, of course). However, the technology lead to start with, coupled with being able to (unofficially) strong-arm the poor post-war economies of Europe and an improved public opinion over what we'd expect from our universe, they're in a very good position to lead the Cold War and emerge very strong for WWIII, whenever that happens. 

Where there are uploaded personalities, there is code. Where there is code, it's easy to add an extra line to give a location marker. Just like how in the real world we have to update our address on our official documents (driver's license, etc) when we move, we could virtually update our "address" in a central database when we "move". Now, it wouldn't be every time there is movement, just every time there's "permanent" movement. Of course, if we're uploading consciousness to a computer, it would probably be easier to do away with a location-based representation model and just move to a more general representation model. Maybe say everyone gets an identification number, and representatives represent a particular range of IDs. As long as everyone has representation, it'll work just as well and with the added benefit of not having to worry about the location problem. 

The big one I'm seeing right off the bat is that the struts would need to have two dimensions of motion. Right now they can fold front-back so that the membrane can fold up against their side. For powered flight they would need to be able to move up-down as well, like a bird flapping its wings. Birds have ball-and-socket joints on their wings, like human shoulders, which is why they're able to both flap and fold. Your flying lizards would need something similar, though it's a bit trickier since it's not a primary joint (and it seems like you don't want them to look like dragons). And of course, going along with that, they'd need the necessary muscle structure to be able to flap them. Another issue, though one that I don't know enough to be able to answer fully, is the question of the lift:weight ratio. They need to be able to generate a certain amount of lift to be able to lift a certain weight (think Monty Python - "A five ounce bird could not carry a one pound coconut!"). Therefore their wings would need to be big enough to generate that much lift. In a similar vein, as much weight as possible would need to be cut. For instance, many birds have hollow bones, as that's an easy way to cut down on weight and make it easier to fly. I'd guess something similar would need to happen for your lizards, and also probably shorter tails.
