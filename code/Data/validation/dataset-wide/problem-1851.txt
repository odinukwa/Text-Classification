It is very rare in any hiring process to hear back if you were not selected to move on. That's just life. It is annoying but it is something you need to get used to. Annoying people with repeated calls (one is fine) to find out can ensure you won't ever be considered for anything else by that person either. If I had resumes for 1000 candidates and phone interviewed 100 and decided to interview only 3, who am I as a hiring offical or recruiter most interested in contacting? It takes a lot of time to contact everyone you eliminate from a hiring process and the people doing the hiring rarely have that time nor have any particular need to make the people happy that they weren't interested in hiring. Now if you are down to being one of the final two candidates, you will hear back sometimes when they decide against you. But that is usually when they would have hired both you and the person they did hire and they might be interested in you in the future, so they want to stay on your good side. I can assure you that you will hear back if they are still interested. Not hearing is an indicator that they are not. If you think they are interested and just haven't gotten around to making a choice and you have another offer that is less interesting that the one you are waiting for, feel free to call and tell them that you have another offer but are more interested in their job and would like to know if you are still in the running or when a decision will be made. But don't keep calling and calling. This makes you look desperate, it annoys busy people and it gains you nothing. I have never seen a hiring decison turned around positively for a person because someone kept calling us. Just because you feel you did well in an interview, doesn't mean that ten other people didn't do better. So don't put your eggs in one basket and keep looking even if you think you did well. 

Hiring season varies depending on the company and the job but here are some general guidelines: Entry level jobs cluster around the spring graduation when there will be the most candidates. Other hiring tends to revolve around several things: 

Some people think that they have no need to answer IM or emails because they only want to do the tasks they want to do. Your task isn't important to them, so they ignore it. So if I have a colleague who doesn't get back to me in a timely manner, I go actually ask them the questions in person (or by phone if they are remote). Be polite but firm. If they try to avoid answering, explain you need the answer immediately becasue you can't make any progress until the issue is resolved and then stand there until they help you. YOU cay say it casually (not in a nasty manner) so something like "Hey I hadn't heard back from you about ABC, so I thought I'd see if you can help me out or when you will be able to get me the information." Ask if they will show you where you can get the information so you don't have to keep bothering them. Note that you don't do this if they are only not answering you instantly, but if several hours have gone by without even an acknowledgement of the message. Another approach is to schedule a meeting with them. Then discuss how they would prefer to be contacted and how you can resolve the communication issue so that both of you can get your jobs done. You may find they think you are bothering them with things that you should be able to figure out on your own. If they still refuse to give you what you need, you may need to escalate it to the boss, but this is an action of last resort. You won't make friends this way, but sometimes you have to do what you have to do to get the job done and if people know they can't tromp on you they will be less likely to try in the future. 

Since you have previous work experience, I would ask the boss to assign me to the more complex of the available projects. I might also tell him some subjects that I have an interest in and see if he has anything related to that. I see no problem with politely expressing a preference. Do not make a demand however. However, the projects may be written in stone for the internships and he may not have anything better to offer you that can be accomplished in the short time period. Therefore, if he turns you down, don't pout or do a poor job. If the goal is to get hired permanently, you want to impress with your performance. Do the tasks assigned well and beat the deadline, so they are impressed. If the goal is simply to check off the intern block in your course list, then do a good enough job to get a good grade but save the learning of more complex things for outside the internship. 

That would be a very appropriate thing to say when asked why you are leaving. I think moving to another firm in the same industry will be problematic for you at this point in your career. If you tell them who you are, they will feel nervous about industrial espionage. You are currently working at your parent's firm and they will recognize the last name and feel even more nervous about you if you don't tell them. If they find out later that you lied and didn't tell them, you are likely to be fired. If you go to work for them for a couple of years and go directly back to a management postion at your family firm and you push an idea is in any way related to something they were doing, it looks even worse to them and you could get sued. This would not be as much of an issue if your family firm was not currently doing international business. But as it stands right now, just because they are not currently in competition doesn't mean it will remain that way. They might even see this as a signal that you are being sent to this differnt geographic area as a way to learn how business is done there before expanding in that direction. Personally I would be more inclined to hire you if the change of companies was truly diverse experience such as being in a differnt but possibly related industry (Such as a medical equipment firm instead of a pharmaceuticial, for example) or an entirely differnt industry. It also would probably be a better way to get the broader experience you want. People aren't going to know your family and you will be accepted or not on your own merit not by being the potential heir to the throne. Further, experience in a different industry will give you a far different perspective than staying in your same industry. Different industries tend to make different assumptions and seeing and changing the assumptions is part of the job of a CEO. It might be best to move into management in another industry entirely. Management skills directly translate to different industries so you are still gaining valueable experience. Then after a couple of years, move back to the industry you are interested in but a firm different than your parent's firm. Once you have successfully had outside experience, people aren't going to see you so much as wanting to commit industrial sabotage and won't be seeing you so much as someone who might not really be capable because he got his previous jobs due to his parents. Then move back out to a different related industry, then to your parent's firm when you are relatively experienced at the mid to high management level. 

You have to look at this as an advertisement for you. So be very critical of what you put out there. It is better to have 2-3 complex data problems and their resulting solutions that 100 short class examples. Real solutions have things like unit test and comments. They have requirements documents. If you want to show that you are better than your competition, you have to show that you are by making your Git hub examples be the best they can be. If I am hiring and have two people with roughly the same experience and one shows a git hub of a 100 tiny projects most of which appear to be class examples and all of which look like quick and dirty code and one shows three complex projects and the presentation is professional including until test, comments, error logging, etc., which one is going to impress me more as a hiring official? In data science in particular, I want to see evidence that you understand the meaning of the data and that you considered how to clean a and transform the data as well as analyze it. I would want to evidence of different analysis methodologies you used and a discussion somewhere of why you chose the one you did. I would want to see presentation documents on how you presented your results because presentation and persuasion are two of the most critical skills needed in this area. I am most concerned about this statement: 

Under no circumstances should you answer that. You can get into legal trouble. Your answer is that it is not the company policy to provide feedback at this stage. We need to compare you to other candidates before making a determination. It is not your job to help them improve their interview skills. If you tell them what they did wrong, you can get them begging for second chances or suing because they do not feel they were fairly evaluated. Personally I would find it a sign of a poor choice candidate if they are so stupid as to ask this unless it is very entry level. 

I think you do yourself and the company a disservice if you don't bring up the problems.The end result of this is that the person leaves or is fired or you leave because you have described an irreconcilable problem. Do you think they would rather keep this person and lose you from your frustration with this person? Suggest you make it clear to your boss what things you are accomplishing.This is a situation where you have to toot your own horn. Often when people are like this, they are also very good at taking credit for the work of others, so the first priority is to make sure management knows what you are doing and get credit for your successes. Suggest you let the tasks assigned to the other person fail instead of rushing in to fix them before anyone notices if you are doing that. You want a clear difference between your work and his. If you have to take over something because he failed at it, then let it fail and then fix and let your boss know that you fixed his bad work. You can be very matter of fact about it, you don't have to accuse him, just say that such and such wasn't working and you stepped in to fix it. What you are doing currently is masking his bad performance and thus enabling him to leech off of you. You are not doing anyone any favors by doing that. You have trained him that being lazy and expecting others to do his work is a good strategy. You might even try a frank talk with him before you do this - telling him that he should be fully up to speed and you don't have time to do his work and yours. I know once I had to tell someone exactly why a different person was getting a promotion and she was not. It was an excruciating conversation. And we shared an office and it was uncomfortable for awhile. But it was necessary. I am not saying this conversation will work out well, I expect it won't from what you wrote. But being uncomfortable after telling a few difficult things to someone is just something that you occasionally have to do at work. Is it uncomfortable to do this? Yes. But it will make him more likely to leave when his bad performance is noticed and all he really has to do is step up his game to fix it but I am betting he won't want to. I wouldn't worry in this case about be asked to give a recommendation. I have never yet had a leech ask me for one if I didn't let him leech. It might also be helpful if you search out some books on co-dependency as they have some strategies on how to have these types of conversations when you are no longer willing to let them depend on you to fix everything so they don't have to bother.
