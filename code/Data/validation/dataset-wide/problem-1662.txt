CPR on Television I don't know how many times I've seen CPR done on television where the patient immediately wakes without exhibiting any major outward signs of the effects caused by either the cause of the cardiac arrest or the CPR itself. In the real world, this is very, very often not the case. While there are some aspects of CPR as shown on television which are correctly portrayed, there are also some which are incorrect or at least inaccurate. Whether this is done for dramatic purposes or due to lack of knowledge on the subject is up for debate. For the purposes of this answer, it will be much easier if we assume that all CPR done on television is done correctly. The science... A paper studying depictions of CPR in 3 different (Rescue 911, ER, Chicago Hope) American television programs states quite clearly: 

Don't let the fact that this product is marketed toward cute, healthy babies distract you from an understanding of just how important research into language acquisition actually is.... While the idea of baby being able to wave a hand to alert mommy and daddy to the fact he's hungry or filled up the diaper again seems adorable, yet trivial.... Just consider some of the studies done with regard to hearing-impaired children, children with autism-spectrum disorder and children who have received cochlear implants and you can see how vital and emotionally charged an understanding of the dynamics of communication between parent and child actually can be, that's the real research this based on. Here are just a few.... Will They Catch Up? The Role of Age at Cochlear Implantation in the Spoken Language Development of Children With Severe to Profound Hearing Loss Defining Spoken Language Benchmarks and Selecting Measures of Expressive Language Development for Young Children With Autism Spectrum Disorders Spoken Language Development in Children Following Cochlear Implantation Does a foundation in legitimate principles and valid research imply a claim to efficacy? No. It doesn't. But no one makes the claim that Baby Signs is either guaranteed or effective. It only makes the claim that it is based on years of research, while leaving the reader to draw his/her own conclusions. They do offer a money-back guarantee I'm told (their people were very nice on the phone). After digging through the site, it seems most claims are made only by the slightest of implications and through videos of cute babies doing cute things. Even clicking on the "research proven benefits" link yields only this group of claims anyone could argue with until the proverbial cows come home: 

Of course, condoms are not 100% effective, because nothing is, but Myron S. Cohen sums up the issue nicely in an academic context: 

Amylotrphic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) - currently being studied but as of now, I find the data unavailable Crohn's Disease - treatment of at least one pediatric patient was attempted, however the data is unavailable at this time. 

In this answer, you're going to see some of the same arguments and tactics as you see from those pushing DCA as a potential cure for cancer. This is mainly because this particular line of treatment may yield some legitimate benefits for a variety of related conditions, but has not yet been been appropriately tested, even though studies are underway (as I'll show later). Simply put, until the data is in, there is no reason to think that Low-Dose-Naltrexone is a miracle cure for anything, or that there is some conspiracy to keep evidence from coming to light. Steve Novella and PZ Myers take a good look at this issue in both neurologicablog, and pharyngula it's with regard to DCA and cancer, but they address the issue of jumping the gun before the research is in and the "big pharma is covering this up" aspect of the argument, which is essentially the same here. What is Naltrexone? 

When encountering the average bumpy railroad crosssing such as the one pictured above, does slowing down almost to the point of stopping (as you would for a speed bump) produce less stress on the vehicle than simply continuing over the crossing at a normal rate of speed? There are a lot of varying opinions on this topic, such as this discussion taken from the Nissan Maxima board (which I picked because it represents sort of an "average" car in the US). I have heard people argue quite passionately for either method. Has scientific study ever yielded an answer to this question, or even produced a reliable set of guidelines based on demonstrable evidence? (Also, I'm aware that a truck designed for off-roading or heavy hauling is less likely to be damaged than a low-riding sports car. While that is an important factor to take into consideration when answering, that's not the central question here.) Photo Source Tampa Tribune 

This seems to be a fairly succint statement of their thoughts on the matter. In a sense, they are correct, condoms alone will not stop the spread of HIV-AIDS, but nearly every single study shows that it will greatly slow the rate of transfer. However, perhaps acknowledging the severity of the problem (death total in the millions worldwide), the church does admit: 

Diffuse axonal injuries can occur at the time of the initial impact, or develop during the minutes or hours after the injury. Length of time unconscious correllates to severity of the brain injury 

Concluding (finally) Most movies simply cherry-pick the most convenient aspects of head injury to advance their plot. Either the person will only be unconscious for a very short time and wake up relatively fine, or the person will be unconscious for an extended time, but likely suffer severe consequences. 

The story can also be found on an episode of weird or what available on youtube. Of course, the fact that these claims circulate mainly on paranormalist websites is reason enough to be skeptical. It seems more likely that these results could be due to contamination, error, or possibly hoax. But if not.... Do these "cocaine mummies" indicate some pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact between continents? 

Some say that the reason you lose more heat through your head is because "heat rises" and most of your body heat naturally escapes though your head. Is this true? Does more body heat escape from our heads than from other parts of the body? 

Even when viewed skeptically, it seems harmless enough, though I'll look at the MLM aspect later. History of the claim: Just how legitimate is the research (and researchers) Baby Signs is founded on? As to the request for study on this topic, there is actually quite a lot. More than previous answers would lead you to believe. A list of publications from Linda Acredolo (The seemingly more predominant academic of the two) can be found here. She has published extensively on spatial recognition and symbolic gesturing in children among other topics. To the best of what I can find as of now, her publications have all been fairly well received. Two of her more notable works with Goodwyn would be: 

The signs and symptoms a person with this condition will manifest are dependent on many things, such as the length of intestine involved, and age. In infants Celiac can be life-threatening or cause permanent sequelae such as growth and developmental delays, weakness and muscle wasting. In older children gastrointestinal symptoms are often seen, such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, dyspepsia, flatulence and weight loss. In adults the condition is less likely to be life-threatening and are often vague or non-specific symptoms such as impaired fertility, fatigue, depression, anemia, and sometimes short stature. Adults are more likely to manifest these symptoms than the digestive symptoms displayed in younger patients with celiac. The symptoms exhibit this wide range and variety of presentations because they often co-present with the symptoms of malabsorbtion caused by the damage done, which is dependent on the amount of intestine the disease has damaged. Also relevant is the fact that up to 40% of patients who have been diagnosed serologically (In the US, serologic tests are usually IgA endomysial Antibody Test and IgA tTG antibody test which have >90% sensitivity and a >95% specificity for celiac, so they are fairly reliable. There are also other tests available, though) for celiac have the "silent" form of the condition, in which there are little to no symptoms present. The reason for this remains unclear (This comes directly from Current Medical Diagnosis & Treatment, but the one my shelf, sorry). Those who may have a "silent" or sub-clinical(sometimes referred to as "Non-Celiac sensitivity popularly, but not by the medical community) case of Celiac will of course benefit from reducing, if not eliminating gluten from the diet. However, true elimination of gluten exposure is extremely difficult, as it is in practically everything, not merely food products, but many medications, some glues, such as one used in certain brands of cigarettes (I know, yet another reason not to smoke). Even though attempts at self diagnosis are almost always unwise even for trained medical professionals, if a person perhaps has a family history of the disease or a strong reason to suspect they might be experiencing a reaction to gluten, certainly a trial of a gluten free diet for a period of time is a relatively safe way to see if improvement occurs. However there are certain comorbidities with celiac disease that should be looked into by a physician, such as diabetes, osteoporosis, increased risk for certain cancers, if you think you actually do have celiac. And now for the fads.... The main "selling point" for the gluten-free diet is the reported under-diagnosing of celiac (at least in the US). As Harvard Health reminds us: 

Is there any way one man, working alone, mostly at night, could have made this structure without using modern equipment? Its website is here. 

I've encountered this one many times over the years, mostly in those "useless facts" books and sites such as the one here. In fact, it's been one of those bits of trivia I seem to have unconsciously taken for granted as true, probably due to the sheer number of times I've heard it. It occurred to me though that while I've often heard the claim stated, I've never seen it proven. Has it been scientifically proven that ants are capable of lifting 50 times their weight?
