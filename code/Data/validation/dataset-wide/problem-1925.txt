Work with your employer to construct a more resilient structure. As an example, you could have an assistant position in your team for someone who will be able to step in when you are unwell; assuming you are still able to talk to them about the current status of a project, to explain details etc, then handover is still very possible. In any team there will be people looking to step up the ladder, so there should be willing candidates for such a role. They may become competition for you, but there is no silver bullet here. In an ideal world I would suggest becoming a 2-person company with someone else, and being taken on together by an employer. That way you could train them to be able to step in, and come to some arrangement on pay and training with them privately. Unusual arrangements like this, however, are usually hard to sell to employers. By approaching your employer to seek to address the issue constructively, you should be able to come to a workable arrangement. If you do not, then events may decide things for you. 

The only "bad" answer here is to use generic adjectives that don't set you apart or boring, vapid ones that say "He's a muggle." (Obviously, you don't want to get too wild and wooly - "hard-drinking, life of the party, etc..." But an interesting adjective has a lot to commend itself.) Oh, and you don't need 5 - you just need one really, really good one. (And 4 backups, in case you don't wow them on the first.) Everybody is "smart," "hard-working," and "creative." If you choose interesting adjectives and can back them up this is an opportunity to set you apart. 

You get the idea - try not to us a buzzword, try not to use the same old lines everyone else does. Really, this is an exercise in vocabulary, creativity, and salesmanship. Have the adjectives before hand, and you'll ace it. Finally, if you can ascribe an adjective to something people have actually said about you, that earns you "objectively great." 

I've heard of people doing this; one guy mentioned having an always-on video conference for remote work, which seems to be the usual context for this kind of appliance. Finally found it: Virtual Camaraderie His take on it - having a separate machine for the video conference - is what you're talking about. [Edit: also Project Stargate] I would make a few suggestions: 

I concur with Ajaxkevi here, but I would add this: In childhood, much of life is about obligations and duties and doing what you should do. In adulthood, however, you will see that plans and circumstances change, and that expectations of behaviour are more about approach (i.e. being clear and curteous to your boss) and less about about actions. You have not signed a binding contract, nor would one likely be even legal in most countries. You can do your best to keep the relationship with the company positive, and it will probably stay that way. It is worth keeping in mind that if you have been a great employee they won't want to sour the relationship either as you might go back and work there one day. They have no legal or even social right to demand you see out your term, since the circumstances that are causing the change are largely out of your control. As a side note, congratulations on creating a business at any age let alone so young. Success in business often requires you to make hard decisions about honouring vague agreements or not, or about honouring one arrangement over another. As long as you treat people fairly and openly, you will have a clear conscience when you need to give people unfortunate news. 

Again, in each of these things, the point of effective communication is this simple - Focus on the recipient, not yourself. The best communication has a hint of yourself but is made concrete in a way that says "You are the most important recipient of this." 

Really it matters less whether you use past or present tense than if you are consistent in your use of the same tense. As an advertisement for your services, a resume is just a document that highlights things about you, such as your attention to detail. The old advice about "always use past tense" is more about looking consistent and "style guide correct" than anything else. If only to show your new employer that you are already in the mindset of working for them, I would suggest being consistent in the past tense- but only to the extent that it seems natural. I doubt anyone reading the resume will even notice what you do there. 

Your founders do not value you very highly. It is an entirely classic setup for bosses to think they are doing you a huge favour by employing you, undervalue you and underspend on things that would make you happy. Often, that is why people start their own companies. I don't think the problem is that being cheap is affecting morale, or that you are not communicating clearly enough. They just don't think you're worth it. What they want is a set of compliant workers who are just so happy to work at such an exciting company that it doesn't matter if there's no money being spent on them. Just look at the contrast in your question; the founders boast of their extravagant lifestyle, yet expected you all to pay for a team event that they had picked. That is at best myopic, and at worst you are being screwed. Unfortunately, some people work on this level; it's dog-eat-dog, they really only care for what they can take and they will do the bare minimum to stop you all leaving. If they have investment money, they probably barely care if you aren't working so hard; if they can justify the extra expense to the investors, they can get more money. They only care if you leave because it would look bad to the investors. In this environment, where the management does not show any real care for the workers, the answer is to unionize. Unionize for some R&R? What am I thinking? I'm thinking that this is more than the culture, or the occasional trips out being funded: It is about the management taking the workforce seriously. If you do not stand up to them properly (or quit), they will continue to pay you all poorly, fail to look after you, and generally drive you as hard as they dare. What's to stop them, if they don't have compassion for you? You are incentivising them to do just that; they can keep more of the money by just pushing you all harder for less reward. Some bosses do care for their workers, and those are the companies you want to work for. The rest you have to force into behaving better by threatening to strike, leave, etc. Most are just weak and only need you to show some mettle before they will back down and treat you better. They just don't see the world your way, and can't justify spending more money on you unless you might leave, because nothing is as important as their immediate bottom line. 

*Clarification, based on a good comment. If, after you have gotten through the interview, and been given a job, you may be asked to complete an application that says "Please list all jobs." If you are feeling particularly supercilious, you should probably list it at that time - on the off chance somebody decides to do a full life audit. At worst, the hiring manager may ask, "What's this?" You say: "It's a job I held for two weeks. It really wasn't worth mentioning, because ..." and you then explain. The resume is about the first impression here - the application comes when it is pretty much a done deal. 

Remember that your resume will probably find its way past a parser at some point. As such, adding a section like this - and making it as complete as possible - is only a help to you! Obviously, if you include a "buzzword" you should be able to back it up in an interview, but including the concept on the resume prevents the parser from denying you that interview in the first place. 

Speak more slowly - give your brain a chance to come up with the right word. Use short sentences - "I have a difficulty to give a right shape of speech to my thoughts or ideas or information that I know in order to express it well." -> "I struggle to express my thoughts clearly" Expand your vocabulary - the right word can replace many: "have a difficulty" -> "struggle" Use simple words - a lot of verbosity is just using complicated words for simple things - "However the difficulty is more in case of verbal communication." -> "But it is worse when speaking". 

It doesn't matter what you earned before. Pay is not about fairness to the employer, or somehow universal. Pay is how much a company needs to pay you to get and retain your services. If you find a new job after 2 years, great. During the hiring process you will negotiate salary with the new employer; if they don't offer enough, you won't take up their offer. It is unimportant what your salary is before, unless that is your entire personal rationale for changing jobs. The new job could be further away, have longer hours, be less flexible, and you will negotiate on the basis of what you will accept. There is no way to convince an employer to pay you more because of a salary you once got but have since quit. That doesn't matter to them. What matters is how much they need to offer you for you to accept. 

Unfortunately, you can't just say "Well, if you think it can be done in 2 hours, I'd love to see you try!" The truth is that in order to get projects approved, one often needs to underestimate the project. Once approved, the developers want a cushion. This expands the estimate. The conflict between these two imperatives is inextricably part of the estimate negotiation between you and your manager. One of the most successful tactics I've found is to expand the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS). In project management, this is a list of the tasks that must be performed, presented in an outline form. When initially recievieng the estimate, you probably have 3 levels of WBS. PMP Methodology says you can have up to 6. By enumerating all of the tasks, you can build in a better margin, spread out over more tasks. Not only is it easier to estimate a smaller unit of work, but by defining more of what must occur, you can justify it more easily too. Within each of these tasks, however, its also easier to "hide the camel." Is it really going to take you 1 hour to update DNS for these new websites? No. It'll probably take about 5 minutes. The rest of the hour is all research. The downside, of course, is that it is very hard to say agile when expanding the tree. As such, just putting it all out there, even if informally, is your best defense. 

If people think you're leaving, they may not offer you opportunities you might otherwise get. You may change your mind. If you find your work fulfilling, meet someone significant, become part of a community, you may find you want to stay. 10 years is a long time when you are young, free and single.*

Talk to HR. If the employee is making claims about their disability impeding their capacity to do the job, it is worth bringing an HR representative into play. Your friend is not in a position to judge whether the excuses are valid or not, and making a call either way could be a mistake. An initial chat with HR should clarify matters, and if they agree with the apparent opinion that the employee's excuses are not valid, then he should bring them into a 3 person chat. That way the employee is reassured that they are being fairly dealt with; if they are abusing their status then they may be more likely to misconstrue (intentionally or not) a private conversation between 2. 

I am good friends with the Director of IT in my firm. He recently let on that he knew I was looking for alternative employment, because they are logging my AIM instant messaging application. Although I restrict my AIM usage to after hours, the scraper they use (since I do attach to the network with the same box), is logged. Thankfully, I have good relations with him, and he and I both agree that our company is insane. Unwarranted surveillance aside - does outside evidence that a person is looking for alternative employment in the United States - constitute valid grounds for dismissal in an at-will contract? Note also, there are other ways that an employer can find you are looking - signing up for certain job boards, Linked In, etc... that don't use company resources. In these circumstances, can they take action based on personal time activities? In other words, do I have any leg to stand on if they fire me? 

I find the PERT estimation useful for software development tasks. Summarising: a = time if you fly through it, no delays, no problems b = time you think it will realistically take given known delays and known problems c = worst possible scenario, everything gets delayed, your other bosses give you extra work, and you find a flaw in your implementation at 80% through your plan Estimated time = (a + 4b + c) / 6 Variability = (c - a) / 6 Say you think a task would take a day in ideal conditions, and normally you'd get there in the next 2 days because of meetings, but there are a few stages that could cause problems and then it would be 9 days. Then your estimate is (1 + 4x2 + 9) / 6 = 3 days, variability is 1.3 days, so you would say "I expect to get it done in 3 days, but it could easily take 4.5 days." This way, they have an idea of when to expect it (for delivery to customers, you want to estimate the time to delivery in calendar days, including the effects of meetings, holidays and so on), and an idea of what a conservative estimate might look like. If there is a big variable, like 'it might break component X, so then I'd have to modify and rebuild that component, which would be an extra week', then flag that up in the response - 'I expect it to be done in 3 days, but it tests the limits of component X, so there could be an additional week there'. This is one of the hardest bits of working in small businesses with multiple competing demands on your time. So grasp it with both hands and don't shy away from giving estimates. The sooner you get a handle on it, the better things will be. If quizzed in person, don't be afraid to say "I can't give you an estimate that would be any use off-hand, let me send you something by the end of the day". Good luck.
