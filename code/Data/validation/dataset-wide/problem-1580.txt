Mr. Allen can perhaps be excused for thinking the quote authentic. It had been bandied about in the press for more than a week almost unchallenged. Putin had spoken on national TV and so nothing stopped the press from going back to look at the original video. Earlier Western Press Coverage of Putin's Statement A preliminary verification would not even have required a knowledge of the Russian language. Putin's statement had attracted some press coverage in the West at the time he made it. A number of these reports are available online with fuller, more illuminating versions of the quote in superior translations: 

So the quotation in the form you cite is garbled and has been interpreted in a manner which is at odds with the original context which is a specific denial that Russia assassinates traitors. Notes on Translation The word “загнуться” famously translated “kick the bucket” literally means “to curl up” or "to curl down". What it means here is open to interpretation. The translation “kick the bucket” can be found in Wiktionary as a possible translation of a very informal use of the word. @bashbino’s assertion that such use refers to decline and death rather than sudden death is probably correct. I suspect it is an allusion to the way plants whither and die. In 2010 the phrase was translated "they will croak all by themselves" (The Telegraph, NBC News) In translating “прятаться” as “trying to keep out of view” I am trying to leave the question of whether the traitor is hiding from assassins or simply from people he cannot look in the eye up to the reader’s interpretation. This word can refer to social avoidance such as the behavior of a child who hides behind his mother’s skirt. The phrase “колом станут у них в горле” refers to difficulty swallowing due to revulsion, not to airway obstruction. To make this clear I have translated it “will stick in their throat”. In 2010 it was translated "it will get stuck in their throats" (The Telegraph, NBC News) Similar Statements Putin's December 2010 statement on deep-cover spies and those who betray them was not the first. On July 25, 2010 the Guardian reported a statement on the subject: 

This is the official website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the Republic of Poland - monarchies do not generally describe themselves as republics. In addition, the CIA world fact book describes Poland as a "parliamentary republic" subject to the 1997 constitution and with the head of state "President Andrzej DUDA (since 6 August 2015)" - not Jesus Christ. Further, the articles you linked, if they are true, appear to be refereing to a religious ceremony at which the President was present - not a political or legal change. 

What this says is that there is greater intergenerational equality of economic opportunity in Australia than in the US and that this has not changed significantly over time. Put another way, what your father earned has less impact on what you earn in Australia than in the US. This of course cuts both ways - social mobility is not always upwards. This is then used as a basis for decrying the economic opportunities of a person who is: 

This is simply a statement that in the results, all of the woman had a positive correlation between strength ratings and attractiveness ratings and none of them had a negative correlation. That is, as one went up so did the other. We are not told in the article or the abstract the slope of this relationship which presumably varies for each respondent, that is, does a doubling of the strength rating double the attractiveness or is it flatter (50% more say) or steeper (150% more say). 

The anecdote you give is an example of "a deviation from the process of care" - the accepted process of care being do not stick a NG tube into someone's brain. While these are the most obvious and graphic sources of "medical error", the definition used in the paper is much wider than that. Without being able to access the source documents I cannot say exactly what makes up the "medical errors" being included in the statistics. From the description it would include: 

No, on the occasion in question Putin did not say that traitors would be killed. The quote in your question comes from a March 5, 2018 broadcast of BBC Newsnight. It is a concatenation of three soundbites from a three-minute statement in which Putin says that Russia no longer kills traitors. The soundbites come from the last paragraph of his statement in which Putin paints a melodramatic picture of traitors as broken men living out their remaining days in abject misery leading to an early death. The particular traitor to whom Putin alludes is not Sergei Skripal as some have claimed. He is correctly understood to allude to Colonel Aleksander Poteyev convicted in absentia of betraying deep-cover spies in the United States. The actual fate of enemies of the Russian state is beyond the scope of the question and this answer. Instead we will discuss the beliefs on this subject which Putin was attempting to instill. He was inviting the Russian people to picture traitors dying friendless and alone Men Without a Country, presumably in apartments strewn with empty vodka bottles. The translation in the BBC broadcast alters the tone of Putin's statement and broadens the set of possible meanings of his words to the point that, when they are read in the style used by Western comedians portraying Putin, they seem to convey veiled threats of violence. Chinese Whispers The next day (March 6th) the composite soundbite from the BBC broadcast appeared at the head of article on the website of The Sun, now shorn of the context provided in the BBC broadcast. The article describes the statement as a "threat to 'choke traitors'", thereby changing the BBC's poor translation into an unambiguously false one (as discussed below). The day after that (March 7th) the Independent put up an article with its own version of the BBC video. The article incorrectly identifies it as a video which "re-emerged online" and describes Putin's words as "apparent death threats". Also on March 7th the Telegraph described Putin's words unambiguously as a "death threat". This despite the fact that in 2010 they had reported on the very same statement and found exactly the opposite meaning in it. What is more, the Telegraph goes beyond saying that Putin's words were spoken close to the time of Sergei Skripal's release to assert that Putin was speaking of him explicitly. On March 7th on Good Morning Britain Piers Morgan asked Alexander Nekrassov (former Kremlin adviser) what Putin meant by "kick the bucket". Mr. Nekrassov's answers are apparently interpretations of "they will croak all by themselves" which Putin can be heard saying in Russian in the BBC audio. Mr. Morgan sees this as an evasion. Mr. Nekrassov in turn sees Mr. Morgan's interpretation that Putin meant "they will be killed" as perverse and becomes annoyed. Neither one of them seemed to know the context of the quote. On March 12th the video was mentioned in an editorial in the New York Times. The editorial links to the March 7th article in the Independent and quotes the translation from the video. The editors seem to have obtained some information about the TV show during which the statement was made, but this is a bit garbled too. In particular their description of the question is incorrect and they make no mention of the overall import of Putin's answer. Also on March 12th Newsweek made explicit the hitherto unspoken assumption that Putin had spoken in the style of "a Mafia boss in the Godfather series" while somewhat incongruously expressing doubt that Putin had been involved in the attempted assasination. On March 14th an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council was held. Vassily Nebenzia (Russian ambassador to the United Nations) compared high British officials who accused Russia of the poisoning of Sergei Skripal with Inspector Lestrade who regularly got stuck on superficially plausible theory of the crime and when it turned out to be a dead-end was unable to extricate himself without the aid of Sherlock Homes. To this Jonathan Allen, deputy ambassador to the United Nations rejoined: 

Aside from the limitations on the statistics and the publication bias described above, this is an argument over interpretation of the results. The authors see the preference as having an evolutionary basis - woman like strong men because they are the descendants of people with a preference for strong men and that gave their ancestors an evolutionary advantage. If so, such a preference should be universal. An alternative view that the article ventilates is that the preference is a cultural one and that our culture venerates strength and that these woman learned to do this too be growing up in this culture. If this is correct, then the preference is culture specific and not universalizable; across neither space nor time. One study cannot determine who is right or if either hypothesis is. Obvious issues There are a number of issues that pop out at me with how the study is constructed which may introduce biases - I do not know if the authors' addressed these. 

The poll appears to have been the subject of press coverage in July 2016 (see The Star, The Express Tribune and Full Report from 4, 8 and 10 July respectively). These articles are almost verbatim copies and seem to be a media echo chamber - they also appear to be the source of the New York Time's coverage. They all refer to the survey being prepared by "the Ontario Council of Agencies Serving Immigrants and advocacy group Mass Minority" that "will be" released, however, I cannot find the "51 page survey" on either organisation's website. You may want to contact them and ask for a copy of the survey and the data set.
