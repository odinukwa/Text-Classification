There are a couple ways you could do this: Option 1: Go far away Hyfnae's answer touched on this, but if you hide yourself well enough, and do so on a planet far enough away from this society (you said they only found most of the universe, after all), you can avoid detection for a long time. However, once the society's surveillance stations come your way, your activities will need to be downsized immediately. Even if you've hidden your labs well enough to avoid detection, if life on your planet starts evolving too fast or changing too rapidly you will draw more attention than you want. As a result, another option (my favorite) would be to . . . Option 2: Bring in more people What if your conspiracy included not only biologists, but some builders and surveyors as well? You could arrange to construct a surveillance station near the planet(s) you want to work with, and make sure that its leaders are fellow conspirators. Then, you would have nearly unlimited creative control on the planets around the station, as your planets can't be discovered by a society that thinks it already discovered them! Option 3: Change society The final option I can see would be to convince this society that "messing in god-like affairs" is not something to be banned, but embraced. After all, you aid that these immortals get bored of their immortal lifespans, so they build structures spanning entire solar systems. Your conspirators could simply pitch their activities as another way to ease the boredom. To make their case better, they could propose to use a lifeless planet and artificially terraform it. Where's the harm in messing with life that would never have existed in the first place? While this option, if successful, would be the best way to play God without fear of getting caught (society already knows about and agrees to your work) I can see how it would make for such an interesting story. However, I can see an interesting dynamic whereby most conspirators try to hide their activities and a few try to make it socially acceptable. These few would risk exposing the conspiracy, and might become the target of a space-age hitman. Hope this helps! 

Defensive Teleportation A bomb can easily be teleported onto a ship, but the defending ship can just as easily teleport it off again. Ship teleportation systems are programmed to identify high energy reactions and teleport them as far away as possible. Unfortunately, this autonomous system only works because explosions have a 'loud' energy signature that the teleportation can lock on to. Human boarders cannot be as easily identified, and therefore have a chance to gain control of the ship without being spaced. 

Unlikely, but it doesn't necessarily need to Existing spacecraft don't need to deal with relativistic speeds, but they still move incredibly fast. And while satellite-destroying meteors are rare, micrometeors are pretty common. A meter of shielding is far beyond the budgets of any spacecraft we currently build. Instead of trying to use thick solid shields, modern spacecraft rely on Whipple Shielding. A Whipple Shield is a spaced shield - it has two layers with a gap between them. The first layer intercepts obstacles, but it isn't intended to stop them - its purpose is to disperse the energy over a larger area. 

Even as the first layer gets perforated, the holes are small and don't significantly compromise the layer's structural integrity. The second layer isn't penetrated by the more diffuse impact, and maintains an airtight seal. There are, of course, many variations on the design that Fred Whipple proposed in 1946. You can use more than just two layers - that way if the energy is not sufficiently dispersed by the first impact, it can be dispersed several more times before risking your final layer. You can use flexible materials such as Kevlar instead of rigid aluminum. But the basic principles remain the same. By using multiple layers separated by gaps you disperse the impacting energy and make it possible to protect your ship with a great deal less shielding than you would need with a solid shield. 

It depends on what your government is willing to do to maintain population. For instance, if you don't care what the people think / government has absolute power, you could simply kill off people when you're above your cap. However, I get the feeling that this approach isn't what you're going for, so I'll provide a couple other options. Sex ed Educating people about the dangers of unprotected sex and providing contraceptives is a very good way of reducing unwanted pregnancies, allowing all children born to have been planned for. While not significantly reducing the danger of overpopulation, this policy makes population growth/decline/stagnation more predictable and manageable by your government. Advance society Shalvenay touched on this, but advanced societies tend to have lower birthrates, mainly as children have stopped being necessities (for subsistence farming) and have become something more of a burden on parents. After all, it used to be that children helped produce food and clothes, but now parents have to provide that for them. Children are also an enormous time commitment, so for the most part only people who want children, knowing fully their responsibilities, have children. To increase this effect in your society, your government could sponsor efforts to develop underdeveloped parts of the world, if any exist. Once your planet is sufficiently developed, you could maximize the time commitment of children by making daycares illegal, possibly under the premise of helping children by having their parents be the ones who raise them. However Even with both of these options in place, your population will still grow. Just look at the US, one of the most developed countries in the world, where the birthrate is still significantly higher than the death rate. Unless every person in society is willing to limit the number of children they have, you're going to need to take extra steps. If you want to truly and reliably stagnate populations, your government is probably going to have to become morally questionable. Forced infertility You could develop medicine that babies are given at birth to render them infertile, and only with a government permit could they be provided with a drug to stimulate their reproductive systems again. The downside of this approach would be the immense resources required to manage these permits and the possibility of wealth becoming a factor in securing one. Brave New World-esque factories If you've ever read Brave New World, you'll be familiar with this suggestion. If your society is advanced enough, you could produce children in artificial wombs, making entire factories for children. This would give the government complete control on population growth with comparatively fewer resources. Overall If you use any of these options, your government is going to need to do a couple things to ensure their success. Firstly, census taking will have to change. Reliable death counts and birth rates will need to be calculated more than every ten years, probably at least yearly. Computerized birth and death certificates that automatically add to a counter is one option that comes to mind. Secondly, the government will have to take complete control of the world, if they haven't already. People cannot be allowed to have the freedom to have children if you seek to manually curb population growth. However, there is one final option your wise government can take if it does not wish to pursue the above methods. Nothing If your government remains in power forever, it is safe to say that if they wait long enough, the population will grow faster and faster, until food cannot be produced fast enough. This will cause mass starvation and the population will drop significantly and then grow to a sustainable level. Unfortunately, on Earth a "sustainable level" will mean that nearly every aspect of the environment becomes artificially controlled to produce just barely enough food for the now stagnant population. Foods that are efficient to farm/grow like corn, potatoes, and fish will begin to dominate markets, and many species useless to humans will die out.

Tar pits Why invent a new trap when nature has one that it's been using for thousands of years? And they're self concealing! A few years of dust and no one will ever suspect that the bones of a few dozen explorers lie beneath their feet until it is too late. 

You all are picking boring animals. Let's go look at the extinct list! I'd start with a glyptodont. It's basically a giant armadillo. It's strong but slow, and a quick shaman with a knife should be able to get past its armor without trouble. Now that you are invulnerable from the neck down, it's time for some strength. Bears are the obvious choice, but I think that they are probably outmatched by the 1,000 kg giant ground sloth. Now it's time to get some speed and endurance. Here the pronghorn is probably your best bet, if you can catch one. Sneaking up on one in the open plains where they live might be difficult, though, so you might turn instead to the majestic moose, which can clock in at 35 mph for over 500 m are excellent swimmers and can kick in every direction. For stealth and a wicked pouncing leap it's time to go jaguar hunting. And now you're ready to face your mammoth! 

To add to the list of horribly dangerous chemicals... Hydrofluoric Acid There are plenty of acids that are more dangerous than HF, but it would probably be significantly harder for your heroes to get their hands on fluoroantimonic acid, triflic acid or the like. And HF is plenty dangerous on its own. From the Wikipedia article: 

Finding out the claims does not need to be easy. There's no central register. Any close city might have something in their records but a written contract in some private drawer might be lurking around, too. In medieval times credits were usually paid back by nobles in terms of "royalties" (pun likely not coincidental but etymological). The noble got money now in exchange for lending his rights at something later like a source of tax income for a certain amount of time. This means the bridge as a tax source might be lend off to a rich family (the forerunner of banks) only to fall back to him after the time agreed in advance expires. The bank gambles on the income in the near future. They will calculate carefully to make sure they'll get their share. This might already be the case. If so, the bank has a strong but time-limited claim. If not, any other claim (by other lords) can be circumvented: The knight should address the king with concerns about the state and load of the bridge. He proposes to reduce the load on the already run-down (even if it's not) bridge to allow for repairs, if he gets in writing the right for taxing any new and old bridge located once the length from his island to the capital downstream and twice upstream (supposing the capital is located upstream, otherwise vice versa) regardless of previous arrangements. If he's able to get that, he has royal decree that nullifies any claims and ensures he will always have the closest bridge to the capital. Plus he doesn't need to repair the old bridge, because he only assured to allow for not actually pay for repairs on his own. Next he gets a credit lending out tax rights on the old bridge. The bank is bound to ask for the use of the money: "Constructions, I want to invest in my land to make it prosper by attracting more trade." The bank will likely agree, because more trade means more income from the bridge, which they will get. Now the old bridge isn't of any concern for him. He already got a fixed share of the money beforehand. If there are any claims: Sort them out with the bank yourself! He invests the money into building a new bridge. The bank will be pissed, because he'll be cutting their tax income with the new bridge: "But I said I'll invest in constructions!" With the two concurrent bridges, tax will be low attracting many merchants. The knight can increase the tax, as soon as the old bridge falls back to him. In case there are strong claims over the old bridge, he can also sabotage it. He should only do so after the bank's claim expired. No need to anger them too much. Now for water rights: He can have some bandits coming along the river. Attracting bandits shouldn't be too hard. If everything else fails, have some loyal men play them. The bandits anger the king a little. And the knight reports his watch saw a boat escape along the river around that time. However he was unable to do anything and still is, unless he's allowed to deploy some chains across the river to stop and check travelers. This should clarify water rights right away. Now the Knight owns two sources of income: 

Emphasis mine. Wikipedia also provides a quick how-to on where you an acquire some if you can't find any in the lab. 

It could go either way, but I'd lean towards cooperation. I saw a documentary a few years back (which I unfortunately can't find at the moment) about a group of Israeli and Palestinian kids who were brought together for a while. As best I remember it, the kids entered with the prejudices they inherited from their parents, but upon meeting each other they abandoned them pretty quickly and became friends. I don't remember if any of the kids had been directly impacted by the conflict. I also don't remember the ages of the kids. What I understood from that was that the hatred and prejudice that fuel the conflict are taught to the youth at a very young age. But at the same time they are more flexible and will more quickly forget their differences than adults would in the right circumstances. And external threats are excellent at uniting people. 

In an effort to aid conservation, this city put into place several ordinances which make it difficult and expensive to remove trees unless they demonstrate a clear danger to the nearby structures. There are tax breaks available for modifying buildings to accommodate nearby growth without harming it. By the time the tree was big enough for the neighbors to complain, it was an integral structural component of the building and couldn't possibly be removed safely. (Which will be a problem when the tree dies, but all involved are hoping it lays long enough for that to be someone else's problem. )
