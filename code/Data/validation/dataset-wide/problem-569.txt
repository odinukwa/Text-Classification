According to weight weeniesthe Continental Speed King Supersonic is the lightest 2.3 or larger tire. 

10 and 11 speed systems are not compatible. The pull ratio of the shifters is different, as is the cog spacing of the clusters. You may get away with some combinations of frankien-mixandmatch, but as the drive chain wears, the differences become more problematic. Ultimately, most find its not worth the problems it creates. 

My oldest is now 12 - Balance bikes were not readily available 10 years ago in my country. If I did it over again, I would use a balance bike (or take the pedals off a normal bike). Balance bikes provide a natural and safe learning progression. Most kids have come off some sort of sit astride plastic toy, a balance bike is really a 'big kids' version of what they are used to. They then naturally progress on it as the build confidence and competence. Eventually they will be able to everything you do on a normal bike except pedal. The transition to a real bike with pedals is then another natural progression. Other options - trainer -teach bad habits that need to be corrected, or straight onto a proper bike wheeler "deep ends" them - they have to learn a lot very quickly, or get hurt... Neither experience makes for a great way to teach someone or for them to learn. 

If its just one spoke, and you are after functional, not perfection, all you would need it a spoke wrench. If its the right hand side of the rear wheel, you will need to remove the cluster so need tools for that. Tourers often/usually carry spare spokes and can replace them on the side of the road if needed, so you don't need all the gear the LBS has (although it sure makes things easier)..... The actual task for replacement is straight forward (in theory) - replace the spoke, re-install the wheel on the bike and put the bike in a work stand or something so the wheel can spin (upside down is a last resort), use a zip tie on a frame member as a guide and tighten/loose spokes to true the rim. In practice, being your first, it will take all day as every "tweak" you make will appear to do strange things elsewhere. The trick is slow-slowly. Take you time, no more than 1/4 turn then re-check. You might need to tweak the spokes up to a few each side of the broken one - more than that and either the wheel was not true to begin with or something else is happening.. I would look for reasons why the spoke failed, and consider a visit to the LBS if truing the wheel gives you a heap of trouble. 

As already suggested - a road bike would be a better answer and chaining to slicks will help efficiency. As far as cadence and getting more top speed / lower cadence, the MTB cluster you have will have a smallest cog of 11 teeth - you cannot go smaller (smaller on back is higher gear). The only other option you have is to increase the chain ring size. MTB chain rings normally stop at 44. So what size can you go up to - you probably have a 42 at the moment - a 44 is only 5% larger (pedal 5% slower) but over 100 miles it could make a big difference. The clearance with the frame and the front derailleur might prevent such an increase. Going up a couple of teeth could be anything from straight forward chain-ring replacement to difficult and expensive to impossible. If you do go up a size, you will probably need a new chain, and possibly a new front derailleur. Most people that complain about top end speed and want bigger gears are actually not pedalling fast enough for efficiency - more common on MTB's where the riding position and bike geometry is set up more around agility and control than efficiency. There are a few cyclists who can maintain 90+ cadence in top gear on a MTB over 100miles, but not many. Unless you are maintaining a cadence over 80, I would recommend not changing the bike at all. 

(Proviso - I assume your existing rotors are in good condition - if not the upgrade is a replacement of a worn component which needs doing anyway.) It will be fine to use existing rotors. Rotors come in all shapes and sizes and prices, so it can get confusing, but within the same size, the difference is more about balancing cost, weight and durability, the ability to shed mud and the ability to handle heat. Throw into this mix marketing and sales, and most of the information you will find is driven towards getting you to spend money you do not need to spend. There would be advantages in upgrading, my guess is they would be very small and probably imperceptible once riding. You gave no indication how much cash you have burning a hole in your pocket, so we cannot really give you a "Is it worth it? Yes/No" answer. 

I assume you have worked out the problem is your center of gravity is too far back, so there is not enough weight on the front wheel. This is a common problem, and I have found my new bike is worse than any other I have ridden- I went for a smallish frame for tight technical single track. I am still playing around to see what I can do. I assume you have tried leading forward and getting you weight further forward.... On the track, try to slide forward to the front of the seat. Change down to a lower gear and higher cadence, you generate a smoother action and have more control over the torque lifting the front wheel. Ultimate solution is usually a larger frame - more precisely, a longer wheelbase. Assuming you are not able to change you bike there are a couple of things you can do at no or low cost. Slide you seat forward on the rails - this moves your weight forward, but shortens the cockpit. Get a longer seat, which gives you options of riding positions. Forward for hill climb, back for a a bigger cockpit and better fit. Try a longer stem - 75mm is quite short and you should be able to go out to about 120mm. What I suggest is try several sizes and see if you can find a fit that works - talk to your LBS, they may be prepared to let you try on and swap it if it does not work. It's such a trivial job I have seen it done on the trail. Remember to play with seats rails as well. Handlebar height. If you have packers on the steerer, lower the height of the bars by putting the packers on the top or the stem, and see how that feels. As said, all these things are aimed at moving weight forward. Some will change the way you sit and ride, and the best position will need to be a compromise between uphill climbs and other riding. Often, by the time it is steep enough to be a problem, you are quicker to get off the bike. 

Being seen - the higher you are, the more likely you will be seen over a roof top. Clearly some cars are too high or too low for it to make a difference, but the odd car is at a height the difference might be significant. Seeing - in an aero position, its harder to see as much as in an upright. It can be done by actively looking around, but its harder - you have to force yourself to do it. Speed/efficeny - when I go into the aero position, its because I want to go faster or ride more efficiently. My concentration moves towards my riding technique than observing the road. However, it is entirely possible to sit upright and not concentrate on the road (e.g. Focus on music, sending text messages, last nights hot date....etc), so I believe upright is safer with the proviso you are concentrating the same amount on riding. Manoeuvrability - when on aeros your ability to change speed and directions is restricted. If aero position did not compromise agility, XC MTBers would have drop bars. So overall, I would suggest that Aero position is less safe than upright. Quantifying how much difference it made would be harder... 

The consensus opinion (for typical road use) seems to be Deep V's, apart from being best for showing off cool colors and looking good, have no advantage over other rims. Some people report they are stronger - break spokes and go out of true less often, although I cannot find a scientific study to confirm this. What I have read, people have replaced old, worn out, cheap wheels with new higher quality deep V rims, and then claim the Deep V's made the difference. The reality appears to be the new and better quality made the difference, not the deep V. I have found no evidence that Deep V's improve handling, to the contrary, there are many reports of Deep V's making the bike harder to handle in cross winds - presumably due to the larger cross section of the rim. Its not a big surprise that Deep V's and Fixes are commonly seen together - they are both products with more disadvantages than advantages for an average cyclist, promoted with evangelical enthusiasm by a few and ignored by most. 

A bit of noise is not uncommon with discs, if the wheel spins freely don't worry too much unless its annoying you. The tolerances are very fine, so the slightest disk warping cause a bit of rubbing. A bit of dirt and grit also does it.... Mechnical disks usually have one pad fixed and move just one. If the fixed pad is a little too tight it will rub. You may need to undo the fixed pad a fraction and tighten the on that turns the same amount. 

Its almost always more cost effective to sell the existing bike and use the funds to buy a (used) bike you want. Its worth doing it from the perspective of learning about bikes, owning a unique piece of art/engineering "franken bike" or just a cool way to kill some spare time. Doing it because you want a road bike and only have a MTB is the wrong reason. Little things like wrong length cables and chains, incompatibly betwen bottom brackets (chain line problems) can quickly add up to a lot of $$$. If you want drop bars you need road shifters that are not compatible with MTB derailleurs meaning some big ticket items. 

The problem is the current controller built into the LED bulb has no or ineffective EMC suppression. This is extremely common in cheap equipment from unbrand named suppliers, who save costs by not going though the rigourous CE or FCC testing requirements. They also cut costs by not placing components (usually a small cap is all thats needed), and lay out the board poorly so it radiates noise. I have heard of people successfully soldering a small tantalum cap onto the LED board. Best palce is as close to the control IC as possible, across the power input wires. If that does not work, another across the LED itself would help. (Careful, they are polarised) Alternately wrap it in a conductor (Tin foil is good), and tie it to ground to create a Faraday cage. Problem is with it tied to ground, its hard to ride far, and you need a hole to let the light out, but that lets out the RF noise. A better option is to buy a light that meets CE or FCC EMC standards, but they tend to be more expensive. 

For efficiency I would put the road tire on the back, as the rear carries more weight. However, front would be best if cornering traction was important. If the MTB tires have an aggressive MTB tread pattern the mismatch would be best addressed by matching tires and getting another road tire. 

Assuming you have an indexed shifter, more important that the width of the gears is the spacing - if that's the same (I expect it will be) then it will fit on the hub and the derailleur will move the correct amount to effect gear changes. If the shifter is not indexed, then it won't be so critical. You should however replace the chain, as if the cluster is worn out, the chain is likely to be, and the old worn chain will quickly wear out a new cluster. You should carefully look at the chain rings (on the pedal cranks), and replace those (if worn) as well for the same reason. The tooth height and profile will not make a difference. The 14 vs 13 smallest gear will mean you high gear is reduced - potentially reducing your top speed, otherwise it not be a problem. I suggest some light reading over Here 

Its unlikely that the problem is your tire quality. Stump jumpers are not cheap bikes and come with pretty decent tires. Although a Kevlar belted tire might help, its likely to be a waste of money. First up is what you are riding over. Bark, twigs and trees themselves are not going to puncture a MTB tire. Thorns, particularly dry ones, will. Even relatively small thorns (a couple om millimeter) will puncture a tire. If you have punctured and have not removed the offending pointy thing, you will puncture again, this might be what has happened. Are the holes in the same place each time? This is the most likely reason for four in quick succession. Are your punctures one or two holes? If two, you are getting "snake bites" from too low tire pressure - (well covered already, use search).. If you are riding over thorns, then you need to buy thick heavy tires with a Kevlar belt. Light tires puncture easier. Also install thick, heavy tubes. This extra weight wil slow you down, but not as much as fixing punctures does. Consider going tubeless (the sealer also helps seal up puncture holes). You could also ride different trails - I have some locally that I avoid for this reason. It could always be you just had a bad run of it...... 

Although not as good a the stands used in bike shops, a light weight portable stand will hold the bike for larger torque jobs. I replace the BB and pedals with the bike in my light, portable stand. The stand holds the bike, you have one hand for the tool, and the other to hold the bike and counteract the forces close to where they are applied. On the odd occasion I have worked on a bike after a gorilla with a spanner has had a go, or corrosion has seized parts. In these cases, one option is to lower the bike so wheels are on the ground, but the stand still holds it upright. Using correct tools - e.g. longer handles rather than more force allows more controlled application of higher torques. In the worse cases, I will remove the bike from the stand and lie it on the floor. Pedals are easier to loosen with the bike on the floor, its a two second job before putting in the rack, but can be done easily enough in the rack if needed. As far as flopping around - not really a problem, you have a hand free to support and control the bike, and one for the tool. The stand I have has a rod to hold the handle bars steady. A lightweight portable stand is certainly a compromise compared to a professional fixed stand, but if you want something that works 95% and accept it has some limitations (How often do you replace seized up BB's) they are well worth the cost. Given changes in the industry where every season a 'new and improved' way of doing things also means a specialised tool, it won't be long before bikes are like modern cars and DIY maintenance is limited to cleaning and pumping up tires. The only regret I had after buying mine was I did not do it 10 years sooner. It is a tool that will last a life time, and be used a lot, so it is worth thinking hard before getting one that is cheap. One other thing to consider is if you have a carbon bike clamping Carbon is not good. One recommendation is to install an aluminium seat post and clamp that.
