According to multiple sources I've seen, they don't even put jersey numbers on the lineup card, so I don't believe they put anything even on Jackie Robinson day. Here is a picture of a game used card used in the Cubs vs Reds game last season during Jackie Robinson day, and no numbers are present. The only information present is Batting Order position, Name, and Position number. 

As you can see, there are many references to what may have started the ritual, but no real proof. It's just something that people observe, but no real reason is known as to why exactly it started. The tradition, at least now, is people sing "Take Me out To The Ballgame" during this 7th inning stretch. 

No, it would not be legal. If the ball goes into the gutter before reaching the pins, any pinfall that happen after the ball hits the gutter is not legal pinfall, therefore the pins either need to be stood back up(if on the first ball of the frame) or the shot counts as 0(if on the 2nd ball of the frame). Rule 6b - Illegal Pinfall 

According to NBA.com, you must be charged with flopping 6 times or more to be suspended for flopping. 

If you allow an MLB team to call up and send down players at will, there is no stopping them from using whoever they want, whenever they want, and it's basically a roster free for all. There are no rules, limitations, they could use all 90 of their players in one season if they felt like it. For the players sake, it stops MLB teams from just calling them up when they need them, and sending them down when they don't. If there were no limits, or consequences, a player could be stuck in the minors for most of his contract if the team doesn't feel like they always need him, and it hurts his chances of really getting a shot, and working his career. 

According to this graphic, as of 2014, the average Left Field wall sits about 331 Feet from Home Plate, while the average Right Field wall sits about 328 Feet from Home Plate. So basically they are about the same distance, I wouldn't think it'd give either side much more of an advantage. The MLB does state that: 

Since 1927, when the NHL assumed possession of the Stanley Cup, there have been 8 instances of the Stanley Cup Finals consisting of 2 Canadian Teams. 

It is very uncommon that a player, especially one signed to a huge contract would ever take a pay cut to stay with a team, or be able to sign with a team who has a chance to go all the way. It happens quite a bit in basketball, with older players who want to win a ring(reference my first article). 

Well to answer the question specifically, a big reason they chose to split him out wide against Sherman, is because of Sherman's arm injury. A big part of Sherman's game is getting his hands on receivers, being more physical, and bumping them off their routes. Now Gronk has 3 inches and 70 pounds on Sherman, and with his bum arm, he wasn't able to lift it and use it to full strength, so Gronk would be able to take advantage of the size differential a lot better with a less than healthy Sherman. That's why you saw, at times in the game, other people going against Gronk, because Sherman wasn't at his best and able to be as effective against the bigger receiver like he usually is. 

Here is another quote from this article that shows Jon Lester's willingness to take a pay cut to stay with the Red Sox, just as Pedroia took a lesser offer from the Sox to stay. 

According to MLB.com, it's been done 17 times, and here is a list of all Players who have hit 4 Homeruns in a game: 

According to this list of MLB Rule Changes, bunts started counting as strikes in 1894. A foul bunt that is not caught in flight is always counted as a strike, even if it is a third strike. 

The biggest difference is in the number of Defensive Backs on the field for the play, and you would use the dime defense to prevent the mid to longer range passes. A couple of explanations below will help clarify it for you. While it is great in the pass game, it does leave the defense susceptible to the run. 

So, assuming you're talking about offense, technically it seems that you could run towards the line of scrimmage before the ball is snapped, but you would have to stop, set yourself for one second, right before the ball is snapped. The rule according to Sporting News 

According to Wikipedia, the 7th Inning Stretch is something that is widely disputed, and no real record exists of exactly when it started. There are several accounts of what could have started it, but no real proof that any of them are the real reason it was started. Can't really comment on why it's in the 7th inning and not earlier in the game. 

The definition of "faux" is: artificial or imitation; fake so if you don't want to play with real feather shuttles, you can buy the "faux feather" shuttles and be safe to know that they aren't real feathers, but fake, imitation feathers, made to look or feel or act like real feathers, but they are not real. Definition of "Faux" 

According to this chart, the number 62 is designated for Offensive Line and Defensive Line. As Leonard Williams is a Defensive Lineman, he is more than welcome to wear #62. 

Possibly yes. I've only ever heard of players being willing to take less. Here is a link to an article showing players from different sports who have taken pay cuts to stay with a team, or to be able to play one more year even if they might not be the player they used to be. Here is another article from 2005 where Chipper Jones of the Atlanta Braves offered to take a pay cut so that the Braves would be able to keep Tim Hudson. 

Basically the squib kick is used at the end of the half or end of the game to run out the clock, and keep the ball away from a top of the line return guy. You basically pooch it down the field so someone bigger has to pick it up and run with it, instead of putting it in the hands of the other teams return specialist. According to Wikipedia: 

Basically, as this quote states, the quality start statistic was brought about to point out when a pitcher might have lost, but still pitched a quality game, in which he could have, or even should have won. The Quality Start states that it is completed when a pitcher pitches "AT LEAST" 6 innings, while giving up no more than 3 runs. So the reason it is retracted if he pitches a 7th or 8th inning and gives up a 4th run is because the rule does not simply state if he pitches 6 innings and gives up no more than 3 runs in those 6 innings, he gets a quality start, anything after that is gravy. It simply states that to qualify for a quality start, you must pitch at least 6 innings, meaning you still can't give up a 4th run after the 6 innings have been completed. [3] 

Well, there are a few downsides for left handed catchers, such as throwing out a base stealer at 3B, which would probably happen more often with a left handed catcher, but probably the biggest reason is pointed out in this quote I found here: 

I can't confirm 100% but my best guess is no. First of all, it'd be tough to find 10 players who could all start on one team, and that a team would also be able to afford. The best example of someone doing something like this is the Greg Popovich coached Spurs, as on multiple occasions they will bench Manu Ginobili, Tony Parker, and Tim Duncan, along with others for the back end of back to back games, as a part of keeping them rested and healthy. Another thing that would be tough in this situation is the roster size of an NBA team. You can currently have 12 active players for any given game, so if you had an entirely new starting 5 for the 2nd game of a back to back, you'd only have 7 total players you'd be able to play, unless you played some of the starters that are "resting", which would kind of defeat the purpose of resting them, and not just starting them in the first place. Normally, when a team is going to play a back to back series, they will try and play their main players less than in a normal game, so if LeBron and the Cavs play a back to back, chances are, David Blatt will try and get LeBron off the court with 25+ minutes instead of his usual 35+ minutes to keep him somewhat fresh for the next game. Most of these NBA players are in good enough shape that a back to back isn't going to hurt them much anyway. This doesn't really have a whole lot to do with the question, but I just read an article stating that Adam Silver, NBA's new commish, is looking to realign the divisions and make it so that teams don't have to travel as much, and keep back to backs at a minimum to reduce the stress on players overall.
