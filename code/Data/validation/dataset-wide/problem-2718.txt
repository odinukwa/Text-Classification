For research in this field see for instance : Spät, Knaup, Müller (eds.): Post-Physikalismus, Herder (2014): The keyword is Hylemorphism. Röd, Poggi: Die Philosophie der Neuzeit, Band 4, Beck (1989) p. 265: "L.G.A. de Bonald: So wie es keine Erkenntnis ohne Sinneseindrücke, Empfindungen und Raisonnement geben kann ..." Allerkamp, Mirbach: ‎Philosophy (2016): "Menschliche Erkenntnis, die gemäß sensualistischer Vorgaben ohne Sinneseindrücke nicht auskommt ..." The sources are in German. The essence is this: Without any sensual experience you would not have any basis for thinking. What do you need to think 1 + 1 = 2? Two apples or two strokes or two clouds? You need something: pictures, letters, sounds. Even Helen Keller could add two bodily contacts or count her heart beat. Like writing is impossible without letters, like space is impossible without matter or energy, thinking is impossible without the memory of sensual impressions. Mathematics is impossible without reality in two respects: You need reality to abstract the mathematical notions from it. And you need reality to think and to express the results of our thinking. 

This question Does all matter exist forever? has inspired me with a related question: Will life exist forever? Here life is meant in the widest sense. It need not be an organism based on carbon or silicon. Perhaps the answer should focus on: Will intelligence exist forever? Some interesting ideas about this topic are given by F. J. Dyson: Time without end: Physics and biology in an open universe, Rev. Mod. Phys. 51 (1979) 447. But this paper is certainly not the newest state of the art. 

Here is my opinion about the solution of your riddle: Socrates did not talk about the definition of terms but about the awareness of the own ignorance as the beginning of wisdom (apology, reported by Plato). Ignorance may also be translated as limitation. Defining and delimiting are closely related words. Therefore your source may have mistaken one for the other. 

"Many matters in academia, such as who gets funding, what gets published and who gets employed are settled by a relatively small group of people." (Lucas: "Legitimacy of peer review" ) Often we hear "peer-reviewed" praised as a feature of high-quality papers in science or mathematics - in particular in modern mathematics where a comparatively small fraction of believers in transfinite set theory have conquered most positions as academic decision makers. This position is criticized by others, for instance [Henry Flynt: "Is mathematics a scientific discipline?" (1996)] 

You can denote the symbol or name of x by f(x) and the symbol or name of y by f(y). Then the implication f(x) = f(y) → x = y excludes that different objects have same name: If the names are equal, then the objects are equal. 

The Christian love of the other as the self is in principle the same, here expressed in the positive (as in the oldest Egyptian text): What you want to enjoy that do to others. 

Whole volumes could be written about the various attempts, starting with Leibniz and not yet ending with Russell, to prove from the axioms that 1 + 1 = 2. Of course the answer why 1 + 1 = 2 will be answered in different ways by the experts of different scientific branches, depending on their points of view. But there is a very simple and, as far as myself and many friends and students are concerned, also very satisfying answer. Mathematics, first in its basic structures including counting, and the four basic operations, and later in many productively evolving branches, has been shaped by the physical environment. Therefore it is in no way surprising that it describes this environment. Whether you take two apples or two sheep or two equal masses: The result is always twice of the single property. Even in modern mathematics numbers have been identified with cardinalities of sets. Three is the cardinal number of all sets that contain three elements. (It is not allowed to talk about the set of all such sets, but we say class, and everything is fine.) Three is the number of trees in my garden. And 7*7 = 49 according to the tables which everybody has learnt in school and which they can check with a handful of coins. Therefore there is absolutely no reason to brood about the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences. Mathematics simply has been constructed that way. Therefore it is not at all necessary to "prove" that 1 + 1 = 2. And if mathematicians would choose a different axiom system where 1 + 1 = 3 could be proved, then this kind of mathematics would simply become irrelevant for any practical purpose as we can observe it with other theories which are completely decoupled from reality. 

There are (at least) four different meanings of "to be known" with respect to numbers. 1) All bits or digits representing the number can be given in some system. 2) All bits or digits representing the number can in principle (i.e. with unlimited time and memory space) be given in some system. 3) The numerical value can in principle be determined to every desired precision, but with an error larger than zero. 4) Two well-educated mathematicians understand the same by a phrase defining a number. Examples: The prime number 2^(43112609)-1 is of the first kind. The next larger prime number is of the second kind. The square root of 2 is of the third kind. There are different variants for the fourth kind: The greatest twin of prime numbers or the smallest odd perfect number. (Two mathematicians understand that these numbers perhaps do not exist.) The second even prime number or the smallest positive fraction. (Two mathematicians understand that these numbers do not exist.) Note: If transfinite set theory is true, then there are completely undefinable numbers, and they constitute the overwhelming majority of numbers. 

Gödel's incompleteness theorem is based on: "The true reason for the incompleteness that is inherent in all formal systems of mathematics lies in the fact that the generation of higher and higher types can be continued into the transfinite whereas every formal system contains at most countably many.... In fact we can show that the undecidable statements presented here always become decidable by adjunction of suitable higher types .... Same holds for the axiom system of set theory. [Kurt Gödel: "Über formal unentscheidbare Sätze der Principia Mathematica und verwandter Systeme I", Monatshefte für Mathematik und Physik 38 (1931) p. 191] Since the "generation of higher and higher types" is invalid, at least according to some branches of modern mathematics (e.g., Constructivism or MatheRealism), one cannot derive a general proof of God's existence from the incompletenes theorems. But Gödel himself is certainly what you consider "a serious and respectable person". It is not his incompleteness theorem that proves or supports the idea of the existence of God but a direct logical proof by the greatest logician of the last century, namely by Gödel himself: Christoph Benzmüller, Bruno Woltzenlogel Paleo: "Formalization, mechanization and automation of Gödel's proof of God's existence", arXiv (2013) 

As has been mentioned already: "When the observation is limited to the projection, part of the information about the original object is lost." That is inevitable. A two-dimensional picture cannot convey the complete information of a three-dimensional space. Nevertheless the problem can be overcome by projections under different angles as is usually applied in modern medical applications like X-ray and NMR. There it is possible to see the structure of human bodies, for instance the brain in three dimensions. In order to investigate the tree we had to observe its shadow at different times and if possible cast by different sources. DNA would be out of reach for shadow research. 

Allegedly the human soul has a mass of 21 grams. If so, then it must exist. In 1901, Duncan MacDougall, a physician from Haverhill, Massachusetts, who wished to scientifically determine if a soul had weight, identified six patients in nursing homes whose death was imminent. Four were suffering from tuberculosis, one from diabetes, and one from unspecified causes. MacDougall specifically chose people who were suffering from conditions that caused physical exhaustion, as he needed the patients to remain still when they died to measure them accurately. $URL$ The argument is not very good because it was hardly possible for McDougall to determine the weight of human bodies with the required precision. 

A paradox is a result that seems self-contradictory or logically unacceptable to the layman. Usually it can be explained by experts. A self-contradictory or logically unacceptable result that cannot be explained in a sufficient way is called an antinomy. There are many paradoxes. A comprehensive list of paradoxes is supplied here by Wikipedia. Note that opinions about classification of results are often differing. In particular modern set theory shows plenty of paradoxical results which by many are called antinomies. The antinomies of Cantor's naive set theory are generally acknowledged as such. For an overview see chapter III of the source book on transfinity. 

In order to argue, we need a basis to start from. If we start from present science, then the theory is untenable. Already a bunch of some hundred radioactive atoms will never act in a determinsitic way because for instance the time of decay of a single atom is not determined by so-called hidden variables but is subject to probabilistic behaviour. The existence of unknown deterministic causes (so-called local hidden variables) determining the fate of an atom has been excluded theoretically and experimentally by quantum theory. The key-word is Bell-test experiments conducted in the 1980 years. A pair of particles (electrons or photons) is prepared in a so-called entangled state. Then the spin or polarization of each particle is separately measured. The results show a correlations that cannot result from a preceding state where each particle has a fixed spin or polarization, decoupled from the other particle. So we have to accept probabilistic behaviour which never can reproduce identical states of a bunch of atoms, let alone of the whole universe. And an answer for religiously motivated people: Wouldn't it become very boring for God if the same old way repeated over and over again? 

"Outside definitions" are neither necessary nor available. Everything you know and can speak about belongs to your domain of experience or can be reached by combining elements of this domain. When you start your life, you have not many words except lala and mama or so. Every object you have to learn is shown you as an original or as a picture or a gesture by your teacher, mostly your mother, and you are told its name. Later more abstract notions and their names are added. Leopold Kronecker, a very great German mathematicians said: "Often it has been said that mathematics should start with definitions. The mathematical theorems should be deduced from the definitions and the postulated principles. But definitions themselves are an impossibility, as Kirchhoff used to say, because every definition needs notions which have to be defined themselves, and so on." [Leopold Kronecker: "About the notion of number in mathematics", Public lecture in summer semester 1891 at Berlin – Kronecker's last lecture. "Sur le concept de nombre en mathematique" Retranscrit et commenté par Jacqueline Boniface et Norbert Schappacher: Revue d'histoire des mathématiques 7 (2001)] So everthing is defined exclusively from inside. And of course all particles of the universe exist and all thoughts that ever will be thought and all sets and Russell's male barber who shaves all men who don't shave themselves. Only logic is not fit for all conceivable cases. 

The question is mistakenly put. There is no eternal life. Even if you apply the best machine, the probability that it is destroyed is greater than zero. That means your death will happen with high probability. You cannot be sure to survive. Further the lifetime of a universe that can supply your machine with free energy is limited. But even in the short term, you will not remain what you were when pressed on a hard disk. It is well known that a lot of your psychological constitution and mental state depends on peripheral (with respect to the brain) organs like your heart or pituitary gland, stimulating good or bad feeling by hormones and other products of metabolism. Lack of these stimuli would change your personality in an unforeseeable way. 

Your question is discussed among mathematicians under the key words Platonism and constructivism. Platonism is the opinion that everything is already there (like Plato's ideas). Constructivism is self-explaining. An implication of Platonism, i.e., that mathematics can be discovered, is transfinite set theory. There it is assumed that fro instance all natural numbers and all real numbers are existing. Since it is impossible to construct or identify or distinguish all uncountably many real numbers, this opinion would be meaningless in constructivism. Cantor as the founder of transfinite set theory had a clear vision of the existence of all numbers. Of course, if existing, they cannot exist in some corner of the universe but only in the intellect of God. Same is valid for the hierarchy of infinities playing the dominant role in transfinite set theory.
