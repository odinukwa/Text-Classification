$\mathbf{Proof}$ We shall only prove part 2 since part 1 is identical. $\leftarrow$ If $\downarrow x$ is clopen, then clearly $\downarrow x$ is the least element in $\{C\in\mathcal{C}_{d}(X)|x\in C\}$, so $\{C\in\mathcal{C}_{d}(X)|x\in C\}$ is principal in $\mathcal{C}_{d}(X)$. $\rightarrow$ Suppose now that $\{C\in\mathcal{C}_{d}(X)|x\in C\}$ is principal. Then let $R$ be the least element in $\{C\in\mathcal{C}_{d}(X)|x\in C\}$. Then clearly $\downarrow x\subseteq R$. Suppose now that $\downarrow x$ is a proper subset of $R$. Then let $y\in R\setminus\downarrow x$. Then since $y\not\leq x$, there is a clopen downwards closed subset $S$ with $x\in S$ but $y\not\in S$. Therefore $S\in\{C\in\mathcal{C}_{d}(X)|x\in C\}$ but $R\not\subseteq S$ contradicting the minimality of $R$. We therefore conclude that $\downarrow x=R$ after all. Therefore $\downarrow x$ is clopen. $\mathbf{QED}$ The following propisition is not too hard to prove. $\mathbf{Proposition}$ Let $X$ be a Priestley space. Then the following are equivalent. 

The answer to question $2$ is negative. Let $P$ be any infinite set and let $\leq$ be the trivial partial order on $P$. In other words, $x\leq y\Rightarrow x=y$. Then $A$ is the set of all bijections from $P$ to $P$ with no finite cycles. If $f:P\rightarrow P$ has no finite cycles, then let $C$ be the partition of $P$ into its cycles. Give $C$ a total order $\preceq$. Finally, linearly order $P$ by letting $x\preceq y$ if i$x\in R\in C,y\in S\in C$ and $R\preceq S$ or where $f^{n}(x)=y$ for some $n>0$. Then $f$ is an automorphism of $(P,\preceq)$. On the other hand, $A$ is generally not a subgroup of $Aut(P,\leq)=Sym(A)$. If $P=\mathbb{Z}$ and $f,g:\mathbb{Z}\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}$ are the maps where $f(x)=x+2$ for all $x$ and $g(x)=x+1$ whenever $x$ is even and $g(x)=x-1$ whenever $x$ is odd, then $f^{-1}g,f\in A$, but $ff^{-1}g=g\not\in A$. 

Let me prove that a two ultrafilters $\mathcal{U}_{1},\mathcal{U}_{2}$ on $\omega$ are isomorphic as posets if and only if they are Rudin-Kielser equivalent. Suppose that $\phi:\mathcal{U}_{1}\rightarrow\mathcal{U}_{2}$ is a poset isomorphism. Then whenever $x\in\omega$, the element $\{x\}^{c}$ is a coatom in the poset $\mathcal{U}_{2}$. Therefore, $\phi(\{x\}^{c})$ is a coatom in the poset $\mathcal{U}_{2}$, so $\phi(\{x\}^{c})=\{y\}^{c}$ for some $y\in\omega$. Therefore, there is a unique function $f:\mathcal{U}_{1}\rightarrow\mathcal{U}_{2}$ such that $\phi(\{x\}^{c})=\{f(x)\}^{c}$. Similarly, there is a unique function $g:\mathcal{U}_{2}\rightarrow\mathcal{U}_{1}$ such that $\phi^{-1}(\{x\}^{c})=\{g(x)\}^{c}$. However, it is easy to see that the functions $f,g$ are inverses. Suppose that $R\in\mathcal{U}_{1}$. Then I claim that $\phi(R)=f[R]$. If $x\not\in R$, then $R\subseteq\{x\}^{c}$, so $\phi(R)\subseteq\phi(\{x\}^{c})=\{f(x)\}^{c}$, hence $f(x)\not\in\phi(R)$. If $x\in R$, then $R\not\subseteq\{x\}^{c}$, hence $\phi(R)\not\subseteq\phi(\{x\}^{c})=\{f(x)\}^{c}$, so $f(x)\in\phi(R)$. Therefore, $\phi(R)=f[R]$. Therefore, since $R\in\mathcal{U}_{1}\rightarrow f[R]\in\mathcal{U}_{2}$ and similarly $S\in\mathcal{U}_{2}\rightarrow g[S]\in\mathcal{U}_{1}$, we conclude that $\mathcal{U}_{1},\mathcal{U}_{2}$ are Rudin-Keisler equivalent. It is well-known that there are $2^{2^{\aleph_{0}}}$ many Rudin-Keisler isomorphism classes on $\omega$. 

A simple such characterization exists when one is working with proximity spaces instead of topological spaces. Suppose that $(X,\delta)$ is a proximity space with complete containment relation $\ll$. Then we say that a subset $Z\subseteq X$ is a proximally zero set if there is some proximity map $f:(X,\delta)\rightarrow[0,1]$ such that $Z=f^{-1}[\{0\}]$. On the other hand, the proximally zero sets are precisely the sets of the form $\bigcap_{n\in\omega}A_{n}$ for some sequence $(A_{n})_{n\in\omega}$ such that $\ldots A_{n+1}\ll A_{n}\ll A_{n-1}\ll\ldots\ll A_{0}$. Equivalently, a zero $A$ is a cozero set if and only if $A=\bigcup_{n\in\omega}A_{n}$ for some sequence $(A_{n})_{n\in\omega}$ with $A_{n}\ll A$ for all $n$. This characterization of proximally zero sets was first explicitly spelled out in my paper 2. Since in a completely regular space, a set is a cozero set if and only if it is a proximally cozero set in some compatible proximity, one can define a cozero set to be a set of the form $\bigcup_{n\in\omega}A_{n}$ such that there is a compatible proximity $\ll$ such that $A_{n}\ll A$ for all $n$. Another similar internal characterization of zero sets is slightly more complicated and is given in 1. A collection $\mathcal{U}$ of open sets is a completely regular family if whenever $U\in\mathcal{U}$ there are sequences $(U_{n})_{n\in\omega},(V_{n})_{n\in\omega}$ of elements in $\mathcal{U}$ so that $U=\bigcup_{n\in\omega}U_{n}$ and $U_{n}\subseteq V_{n}^{c}\subseteq U$. In 1, it is shown that a set $U$ is a cozero set if and only if $U$ belongs to some completely regular family. Also, I claim that one can also characterize the cozero sets internally in terms of a way-below relation. Suppose that $(X,\mathcal{T})$ is a topological space. Then define $U\prec V$ if and only if $\overline{U}\subseteq V$. Define $U\ll V$ if and only if there is some $(U_{r})_{r\in[0,1]\cap\mathbb{Q}}$ such that $U=U_{0},V=U_{1}$ and where $U_{r}\prec U_{s}$ whenever $r<s$. The following are equivalent: 

The set $\beta\mathbb{N}$ of ultrafilters on $\mathbb{N}$ is not only a topological structure, but also an algebraic structure as well which is partialy compatible with the topological structure of $\beta\mathbb{N}$ (i.e. it is continuous in one variable). If $\mathcal{U},\mathcal{V}$ are ultrafilters on $\mathbb{N}$, then define an ultrafilter $\mathcal{U}+\mathcal{V}$ by letting $R\in\mathcal{U}+\mathcal{V}$ if and only if $\{n|\{m|m+n\in R\}\in\mathcal{U}\}\in\mathcal{V}$. With this operation, $\beta\mathbb{N}$ becomes a well known semigroup of cardinality $2^{2^{\aleph_{0}}}$. Also, Boolean algebras are interesting structures, but the cardinalities of Boolean algebras are often greater than the continuum. For instance, the weakly compact and strongly compact cardinals can be characterized in terms of Boolean algebras. An inaccessible cardinal $\kappa$ is strongly compact if and only if every Boolean algebra $B$ that satisfies the identity $$\bigwedge_{i\in I}\bigvee_{j\in J_{i}}x_{i,j}=\bigvee_{f}\bigwedge_{i\in I}x_{i,f(i)}$$ (where $|I|<\kappa,|J_{i}|<\kappa$ and $f\in\prod_{i\in I}J_{i}$) has a $\kappa$-complete ultrafilter. There is a similar characterization of weakly compact cardinals since for weakly compact cardinals the above holds only when $|B|\leq\kappa$. 

Suppose that $X$ is a finite partially ordered set. Then a subset $A\subseteq X$ is said to be an antichain if there do not exist elements $a,b\in A$ with $a<b$. Let $\mathcal{A}_{X}$ be the set of all antichains in $X$. Let $L_{X}$ be the collection of all downwards closed subsets of $X$ and let $U_{X}$ be the collection of all upwards closed subsets of $X$. Then Let $\mathfrak{l}_{X}:\mathcal{A}_{X}\rightarrow L_{X}$ be the mapping where $\mathfrak{l}_{X}(A)=\{x\in X|\exists a\in A,x\leq a\}$ and let $\mathfrak{u}_{X}:\mathcal{A}_{X}\rightarrow U_{X}$ be the mapping where $\mathfrak{u}_{X}(A)=\{x\in X|\exists a\in A,x\geq a\}$. The the mappings $\mathfrak{l}_{X},\mathfrak{u}_{X}$ are bijections. Define a mapping $Q_{X}:\mathcal{A}_{X}\rightarrow\mathcal{A}_{X}$ by letting $Q_{X}(A)= \mathfrak{u}_{X}^{-1}(\mathfrak{l}_{X}(A)^{c})$ for each antichain $A$. Then $Q_{X}$ is a bijection from $\mathcal{A}_{X}$ to $\mathcal{A}_{X}$, so since $Q_{X}$ is a permutation of $\mathcal{A}_{X}$, $Q_{X}$ is a composition of disjoint cycles. If $n$ is a natural number, then let $t_{n}$ be the largest number such that there is a poset $X$ with $|X|=n$ and the permutation $Q_{X}$ has a cycle of length $t_{n}$. I doubt that there is a nice explicit formula for $t_{n}$, but it seems like one can produce decent upper and lower bounds for $t_{n}$ or limits involving $t_{n}$. What are some good upper and lower bounds or limits for the value of $t_{n}$? It is obvious that $t_{n}\leq 2^{n}$ since if $|X|=n$, the $|\mathcal{A}_{X}|\leq 2^{n}$. Furthermore, if $n>1$, then $t_{n}<2^{n}$ since if $t_{n}=2^{n}$ and $\mathcal{A}_{X}$ has a cycle of length $2^{n}$, then $\mathcal{A}_{X}=P(X)$, so $X\in\mathcal{A}_{X}$. However, this implies that $\mathcal{A}_{X}$ does not have a cycle of length $2^{n}$, a contradiction. One can use a similar but more complicated argument to get more precise upper bounds for $t_{n}$. Now suppose that $n_{1},...,n_{k}$ are natural numbers. Then let $X$ be the partially ordered set of cardinality $n_{1}+...+n_{k}$ with $k$ connected components and where the $i$-th connected component of $X$ is a chain of length $n_{i}$. Then each cycle in $\mathcal{A}_{X}$ has length $\textrm{Lcm}(n_{1}+1,...,n_{k}+1)$, so $t_{n_{1}+...+n_{k}}\geq\textrm{Lcm}(n_{1}+1,...,n_{k}+1)$. Therefore, for example $t_{15}\geq\textrm{Lcm}(3,4,5,7)=840$. This however is only a rough lower bound and I am sure that this lower bound can be improved significantly.
