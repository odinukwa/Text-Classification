The 5 precepts are clear not to use drinks and drugs which lead to carelessness and the 5 precepts are really the basics of buddhsim - the precept relevant for us : I undertake the precept to refrain from intoxicating drinks and drugs which lead to carelessness. Surāmerayamajjapamādaṭṭhānā veramaṇī sikkhāpadaṃ samādiyāmi. drugs are really connected strongly to greed to attachment which is very anti-Buddhist buddhism is to not attach to aversions and greeds and by that to gain wisdom I understand hard experience in general can also lead to Buddhism - but for instance if you fall and break both legs and back and have huge amount of pain which somehow got you closer to buddhism maybe the pain will prevent you from advancing maybe the bad health will prevent you from advancing or advancing fast so it might be the same case with drugs that they have some benefits but in general the disadvantages are much higher .... especially for someone asking about this or anyone reading this which is already interested in buddhism ! so the plus in getting into buddhism is not there anyway - plus there is a very big chance people have the kamma to get into buddhism and if one event (fall/drugs/breathing/eating/scratching) wouldnt have happened than another one would happen that would lead them to buddhism 

If all the actions that involve volition can happen without volition as well, can volition be assumed to exist and be only under the control of a self ? This is in reference to your question: 

There is suffering, that is the first noble truth. May be you can contemplate on that, see how it applies to you? Also I'm curious, based on this and your other questions as well, have you diagnosed yourself for ADHD ? I suspect you might have a mild case of ADHD, based on what you have reported - lack of focus, lack of interest in mundane things etc. (If that is the case, I see only two options - you have to find some innermost passion or obsession and use that as a fuel or use stimulant medication) Hope this helps! 

I practice mahasi sayadaw - and from my personal understanding its best not to eat meat cause its wholesome - its hard for me to explain all the ways it is wholesome but i think it helps in compassion and in self control like another extra precepts that can help the practice even though its not a must i also found this text but not of theravada which talks about meat eating : Many of the Bodhisattva precepts are about not harming, either oneself or others, or animals. The first major precept is to ‘Refrain from taking life’. It points out in great details that one should not kill oneself, nor cause someone else to do it, nor do it in a roundabout way, nor create the cause or conditions, nor the means to kill. It is an exhaustive list that makes us reflect on the many ways by which we might cause harm. We might not kill other people or any living creatures but do we cause them harm in any other way. And if we cause them harm, how do we do it? Do we do it in a round about way so we do not feel responsible for it? Do we create the causes and conditions for causing harm needlessly? These precepts show us that wisdom and compassion help us to reflect on our actions and intentions. Then the precept explains why we should not kill and that is because the duty of a Bodhisattva is to be always compassionate and to lead others to liberation. There are several precepts that investigate what it means to be non-harming due to a compassionate attitude. The third major precepts, which encourages proper sexual behaviour, states that the reason for doing so is that otherwise perverted, indecent, indiscriminate sexual behaviour would cause compassion to disappear. When one is in the power of lustful thoughts or feelings, can one reflect on what would be the compassionate things to do for all involved in that moment? This precept reminds us: “It is the duty of a bodhisattva to always present a state of mind which conforms to the Buddha-nature and to lead others to liberation by teaching them the pure Dharma.” The third secondary precept encourages vegetarianism on the ground that if someone were to eat the flesh of animals he would destroy great compassion and great kindness and the seed of the Buddha-nature. To this day monasteries and nunneries in China and Korean are completely vegetarian. Since it seemed more difficult for laypeople to be fully vegetarian then six specified fasting or vegetarian days a month were created as well as three special months of abstinence, i.e. times when one avoids animal food. taken from : $URL$ 

If you have crossed Arising and Passing away (mistakenly taken as kundalini, or enlightenment experience) Yes, it is expected you go through it at some stage. refer to: $URL$ $URL$ 

I have experienced the same things that Andrei has mentioned, i.e., loss of joy, relating with normal people, loss of interest in entertainment and other worldly stuff (in no particular order). It even became crippling at one point when I didn't clearly understand what was happening and tried to correct myself unskillfully. But as with many things it was a phase and I no longer suffer from those issues. Some things can become worse before getting better, so even if certain things seem to become problematic at some point it doesn't mean that it will remain that way. I know its not wise to generalize, but that is my experience anyways. 

im trying to understand in what ways we advance - i mean before becoming a sotapanna what do you improve throw meditation and if you answer for example : " you have less ill will your less angry" do you mean we lower the anger levels - if so how - did i remove existing anger "seeds" or did i improve my ability to notice and let go of anger - and if so is this an ability which builds up from meditaiton to meditation ? i would appreciate everything you can expand on the subject of advancing in the path 

I dont get much effect from death contemplation on myself - i wondered lately maybe contemplating the death of those close to me might work to install a sense of urgency do you think its effective ? and should i do it the same way as death contemplation of self or different ? I want to do it to get a sense of urgency all thoughts on subject are welcome 

My two cents: It is not easy to come to a conclusion from the behaviour alone. Consider: A1. Ignoring the error due to indifference/apathy, not caring for whatever the outcome or result. A2. Not interfering with it, because there is good in everything and allowing the natural process to evolve - not siding with push or pull to change the outcome one way or the other, but staying with it, observing one's reactions as well as accepting things as they are. And: B1. Correction being done because one cannot accept the presence of an error, a reaction to correct things based on one's view of how things should be. B2. Correcting because of compassion, in-order to benefit all the beings that may chance upon this. To me, both A2 and B2 are equally good, as they are a display of true equanimity and compassion, respectively. A1 and B1 are not actions without demerit, but B1 is slightly better in a sense because there is a greater chance to learn from it than A1 (going ahead and committing even a mistake is better than totally ignoring it, in my opinion). Of course, in a community managed site like this B1/B2 are the better options, but in regards to right action for mindfulness practice/self development both A2 and B2 should rank equally. 

Is there a benefit to "wishful thinking" ? not like in a very deluded way - but like if i think about meditating a lot during the day - or getting money to also give others and aid practice 

Usually i do a short metta after vipassana - saying good wishes to myself than to someone close than to people i like lsess and less and in the end include all beings i want to do metta before sleep so i can sleep better- but it usually takes me a long time to fall asleep no matter the stuff i tryed --- so in case i have an hour maybe two before sleeping - or even 10 minutes is a long time for me to do metta how do i extend the metta time ? - just repat the metta cycle again and again and again ? 

Simple answer: It's a phase, it will pass. Detailed answer: Mindfulness meditation doesn't result in a strictly upward curve in terms of clarity or perceived well being. This is one of the reasons for getting guidance from someone experienced, so that they can give you proper feedback on whether you are making progress or not. If you don't have a teacher/can't find one, I can give you some tools for self diagnosis, let me know in the comments. But be warned, self diagnosis has its own issues and assuming oneself to be in different stage can cause unnecessary and needless suffering that one can do without by just sticking to regular practice. $URL$ refer to rows 2 (possible current stage) and 3.1 (possible reason for worsening symptoms) 

The sights and sounds were always there. Since your question is about why it is different when you meditate as opposed to the days you don't, may be you need to understand what happens on those days in order to understand this increased sensitivity ? Maybe your mind was caught up in worrying about fulfilling commitments, like reaching university on time. Maybe you were daydreaming, or probably just scanning the environment and only noting novel and interesting stimuli. Probably this doesn't happen on the days you meditate. I don't know about your typical meditation session, so I am assuming you are watching the breath. So you watch the sensations that make up the breath for a period of time. You are not only looking at interesting sensations during this session, you are looking at all the sensations - if you are doing it right. So after this session, when you go out, its only natural that you are not looking at just interesting sensations or worrying about getting somewhere, but looking at all the sensations that make up the external reality. 

What technique you practice ? do you have a teacher ? Cause if you dont i would recommend it In case you have a teacher and you practice in a correct way, than i can tell you what helps me now : which is that every action you do have an effect (even if not every kamma has an effect) so nothing was in vain and remembering that each action you do has an effect can help motivate you - for example if every action you did has an effect than failing and trying again and again even if never successful still has its point see this question - especially the chat i had with Sankha Kulathantille : What are the cases where a karma's fruit is destroyed? 

How to get back to practice after failing ? i always try and fail try and fail meditating for some years- had and have a teacher - did retreats - but i never manage to keep meditating for more than a few days - tried going all in - tried only meditating 5 minutes - or just being mindful ect ect cause every time i fail i take a month or two break if not more so how can i get back to practice each time ? the more i "fail" and take this breaks i feel that its for no use cause i never manage to persevere no matter what i try
