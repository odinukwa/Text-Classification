Without knowing more details, about all I can do is recommend some books by Suzette Haden Elgin, starting with The Gentle Art of Verbal Self-Defense at Work. In her series of books (they all have "gentle art of verbal self-defense" in the title), she describes a number of linguistic attacks and traps that many people don't realize are going on. She also gives a number of responses that can be used to deflect away from the emotional attacks into actual communication as well as identifying the real issues under discussion. 

On resumes, I usually list the contracting company first, then the client company second. For example, I worked for as a contractor, and they placed me at , I usually put something like: 

One of the things the researchers were mentioning was that to extroverted leaders, employees who came up with lots of ideas were seen as threatening the leader's dominance. This leads to a conflict in both status and power. 

I am a bit of a snob when it comes to food, but my experiences in my career have shown that the benefits of going to team lunches far outweighs the downsides. Avoiding the group lunches means that you will end up outside of the team, and I've never figured out how to counter that effect. 

To begin with, very few companies have employees that do interviewing full time. For almost every recruiter and interviewer you meet, you encounter someone who might range from to , to . Very few companies use structured intereviewing to recruit candidates. You are more likely to encounter technique in phone surveys, or in the computer-based personality tests that many retailers and entry level companies screen applicants with (read Punchinin In for more details). Typically retail companies have to hire lots of staff due to high turnover, so they have a vested interest in determining what sort of personality does well, and what fits badly. This means that the sort of person who would do well at Home Depot for example, is very likely to do poorly at Abercrombie Fitch; both stores have wildly different customer bases and product lines. More and more intereviewers appear to be using competency based interviewing. These are less about the details of what you know, and more about how you think and solve problems. For people who memorize a lot of things, these sort of interviews are very hard to pass. One of my pet research areas is in decisionmaking. People do not make decisions in logical, repeatable manners. Interviewing and recruiting employees is just another example of this human foible. For an introduction to why this is the case, I recommend 3 books: Sources of Power. This book describes a new theory of decisionmaking (recognition primed decision) that claims you recognize patterns in previous instances and use those memories to make decisions. Predictably Irrational. The author does research in behavioral economics. So this book is a summary of some of the research he and his colleagues have done on how people make decisions that make perfect sense at the time yet are quite irrational from the economic concept of "rational consumer." Checklist Manifesto. Our lives are rather complicated, and we tend to forget things at inconvenient times, especially when things are framed in particular manners (advertising and politics use framing to divert your attention from what is important to you). 

Sample (for public trust, not classified data). Companies that have other divisions handling classified details and public trust positions have a tendency to try to minimize the different HR policies, so it is likely that they'll use a similar reasoning/standard even for the other divisions. Even though you specifically excluded this sort of thing in your question, the company might not have done so. A friend of mine is a programmer, and since the project involves working with a federal agency, all the developers and IT staff had to pass a public trust background check in addition to the regular employment check. From my chatting with other companies that have asked me to "pass" background checks, they tell me that they're looking to make sure that: 

Section 1706 of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 is responsible. By removing the "safe harbor" (which is section 730 of the Revenue Act of 1978) provisions, this act made it too risky for employers to continue to hire engineers and computer professionals as contractors. If the IRS later reclassified the independant contractors as employees, the employer becomes retroactively responsible for the employer share of the taxes along with interest and possible penalties. A "safe harbor" would allow the employers to skip the past taxes, interest and penalits. Since our profession has been specifically excluded as a matter of law, it is almost impossible to be a 1099 contractor without setting up your own company. The contract agencies get around this issue by making you a W-2 employee of the agency while the bodyshop gets paid on a 1099. This issue bothered one person so much that he flew his airplane into an IRS office in 2010. Some easy-to-read information. As for myself, I'm working on a "Plan B" to get my accounting degree (and later CPA license) as one potential exit plan from programming. This stuff is covered in tax accounting courses because the "independant contractor versus employee" issue is a very thorny and expensive mistake that many businesses get themselves stuck into. 

My current employer has a huge spread in salaries for developers - the highest paid developer gets paid twice what the least paid developer does. While the manager claims that skill and duties are important, the real issue is that people who are good negotiators are making far more than the ones who are weak at negotiating. The highest paid developer is also the guy who thinks that everything is negotiable, so he tends to play negotiating games with everyone. Since he is also the social glue that holds the team together, we tend to go along with the negotiating games. This company also has a habit of paying married employees more than single/divorced ones. People who are shy also tend to be weak at negotiating. Negotiating is arguably the most important non-technical skill you can develop. It is the skill that affects your wallet the most. 

One job I had required me to have lots of meetings and make regular trips to the various production facilities. I got a small magnetic dry erase board (similar to this one) and hung it by the cubicle entrance. I labeled it "Tangurena Finder" and had a large pie chart drawn on it. I moved the magnet to indicate where I was. I'd jot an estimated time when I expected to return. At this job I usually spent about 10-15 hours per week in my cubicle. Sometimes, jokers would change the labels on the pie chart. At this time, dry erase boards were very rare to see in cubes. If I were in a similar situation today, I would print the daily schedule from Outlook and post it in my cube. Ad hoc/last minute meetings would be handwritten on the schedule. 

Based on this remark, I think it is driven by a feeling that you have no control, or things are out of control. This is similar to why people feel scared when flying and don't feel scared when driving; even though flying is safer, the lack of control makes passengers feel unsafe compared to when they are driving a car. Like the others, I'm going to recommend that you visit a therapist in order to determine what levels of stress are acceptable to yourself, and what levels are not. Learn where your boundaries are and if your current company is on the wrong side of those boundaries, one of you has to go: you, or the company. I've worked with people who have anxiety disorders. The most severe one was diagnosed with a really bad case of Aspergers. With medication and a few small changes to the environment (like letting him have an office with a closeable door, instead of setting him adrift in the sea of cubicles), he was able to function. 

This is a cultural issue that depends on your workplace's culture. Some want to inform everyone affected as soon as possible, others want you gone with no one knowing you have gone. One book that has a useful chapter on leaving is called Engineering Your Retirement. It is aimed at technical people, and it gives plenty of advice (and equations) to help determine how much is enough to save for retirement. The checklist and advice at the beginning of chapter 8 is what you should keep in mind whenever you depart any employer (due to quitting or getting laid off). 

At a previous job, our branch office's software had a huge profit margin (about 60%) and our main product had about 60% of the market (for that product). As a result, corporate decided that our cash cow was going to subsidize the entire division (no other branch had a profit margin over 10%, and several were losing money). This resulted in our branch having zero money nor time to make upgrades nor hire additional staff. Nor were we allowed to make any significant changes. The cash-cow milking was a directive which came down from the CEO and that sort of "penny wise and dollar foolish" was what got the CEO fired last year. I got tired and quit about 18 months ago and a recent chat with the boss, he had mentioned that the profit margin has dropped to about 30% and market share is down to about 40%. Many of the larger customers had been leaving for competitors products and the smallest customers had left to use a free website set up by the government. 

I will be resigning my position at $company. My last date of work will be $date. My address is $address. 3.14 Sign and date the letter.

It totally depends on the company and what sort of issue was related to a problem in the past. At one financial company I had to work with, having a suspended driving license is a disqualification because they had one really bad apple who also had a suspended license. Therefore, all future candidates with a suspended license are presumed to be bad risks. This particular person also had been fired from a previous job, so they disqualify everyone who has ever been fired. That particular person had lied about working for companies they never worked for - so any company that says "Who? We have no records of them" is a disqualification. My credit score was in the 500s back then, so they sure weren't looking for someone to lend money to. One of my coworkers worked at a place where his ex-wife is now the HR person, so when she said "he is not eligible for rehire" that coworker was disqualified from working with the large financial client. The federal government takes the viewpoint that credit reflects the trustworthiness of an applicant. Someone who is careless with repaying money is likely to be careless when handling classified information, and is additionally a risk for selling classified materials to pay off debts. This argument derives from their claim that a person accessing classfied information holds a fiduciary responsibility, and that repaying debt is another fiduciary responsibility; and if you can't be trusted (by someone else) to do the little things correctly, you won't do the large things correctly (for the feds). The boilerplate that they use is:
