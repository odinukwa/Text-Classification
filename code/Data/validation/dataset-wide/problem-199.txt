I think a major drawback to birds wearing armor, is that they most likely will not be able to armor their wings. Wings need to be in contact with the air to work properly, so wing armor would need to be at once skintight and offer projection. Metal is out of the question, as are almost all man-made materials. Maybe a thin film of kevlar could work, but that's about it. Birds are more than 50% wing by area(and the larger the bird, the higher the percentage), and probably most vulnerable at the wing. So individual bird-armor seems unrealistic. However, I don't think this entirely rules out armor, just individual bird armor. Several birds would be able to carry a large cloth capable of stopping most projectiles, providing tactical cover for other birds to shelter behind(the cloth can be extended upward with wire so it protects the birds carrying it). These cloths would be like mobile trenches, and battles might turn into encirclement contests between these mobile defenses. You could add slits to fire projectiles through. You could get creative, either way I think this is how bird armor is going to evolve. Some birds will carry the armor, while others will perform combat function. Individual armor just doesn't seem to make much sense. 

Leave messages. This seems to me to be the only way to do it. If a Short Race's lifespan is the blink of an eye compared to a Starmaker's thoughts then there will be no opportunity for back-and forth communication, at least not unless the Starmakers succeed in their goal of increasing the Short Race's lifespan for long enough for that to happen. So, leave a message. Encode it in the alignment of the stars, or the cosmic microwave background, or just bury it on a convenient nearby Moon*. Any form will do, as long as it can last long enough to still be there when the Short Race reaches scientific maturity and is ready for the knowledge it contains. Then, if all goes well, they can use its contents -- the great knowledge of the Starmakers -- to extend their civilization's life span to a duration that would permit a conversation. Some work will need to be done to make the message comprehensible. The message cannot be written in the Short Race's language, since it must be written long before the Short Race even has a language. But with some care a message could be constructed that contains its own key for how it should be read. (Humans have tried this with the Arecibo message.) This might not work the first time. Perhaps the Short Race will not understand the message, or will use it to create a terrible weapon that wipes them out in the blink of an eye, etc., but that's okay. Another Short Race will arise before long; the Starmakers can use the knowledge they've gained to improve the process next time. Perhaps many iterations will be needed. Perhaps one Short Race will send a message saying "our Sun is dying now, but we've got this far, and we've discovered this technology that would have helped us escape if we'd had it sooner," and the Starmakers can pass that knowledge on to the next speicies. Or perhaps the sticking point is not technology but civilization itself - how can you create a society that will be stable for all that time, neither destroying itself through war or overshooting its resources? That might take a lot of trial and error. But once it's perfected, if it works, the result will be that the Short Race becomes a Long one and can finally meet their companions. *ok, so that's basically the plot of 2001. 

That's an interesting question, since we have absolutely no idea what conditions are ideal for developing even carbon-based life. For instance, for carbon-based life, we would expect something like an atmosphere high in ammonia or other simple nitrogenous compounds(you need some 20-30 distinct proteins for DNA replication) to even have a shot in hell at producing life, yet there is no evidence for this kind of atmosphere existing on earth; based on our current knowledge, it is exceedingly improbable that on an earth-like planet(or any planet really), carbon-based life would arise by chance. Yet, it did. The bottom line is that nobody has any idea what chemistry is likely to produce life. But why try to use science to answer a question that it cannot answer? The origin of life in your universe could be a mystery in yours as much as it is in ours. Perhaps in your universe, the panspermia theory is correct, and life arose only once, somewhere incredibly far away. Perhaps your silicon-based life was created by carbon-based scientists, whose civilization was eventually destroyed without a trace. Perhaps your universe is a simulation in the mind of a deity. There are so many ways you can go with this. 

The reaction would be panic, chaos, and confusion. To the extent that the wish would quite possibly never be wished because there would be no consensus on what it should be or who should wish it. As for the wish, I would suggest something like 

First question is jurisdiction. Is this an independent colony, under it's own sovereignty, or is it a colony of an Earth based nation? If the former, then it's really a question about international human rights conventions, if the latter then it depends on the nation. Either way, the defence is basically quod est necessarium est licitum, that which is necessary is lawful, and for the premeditated killing of hundreds of people ... well, no amount of rationalisation, no matter how foolproof, is going to get you off completely. It's politics as much as justice. Let's face it, we in the developed world like our killing to happen in small, regular, impersonal batches. There's a lot of other factors which will affect the outcome, but I doubt things look good for our poor governor. He better hope that he's tried in EU jurisdiction where there's no capital punishment, because he will be tried and it could easily go either way. 

No, not with current technology. Modern skyscrapers are limited by logistical factors, such as concrete drying on the way up to the top of the building. In terms of structural stability, we could build buildings 2 miles high. But raising this to 4 miles doesn't make a difference, many other factors prevent us from reaching this height first. Edit: yes, you could build the skyscrapers with less material, and you could make them skinnier. Elevators would use less power. It would definitely make things easier, but you can't just assume that everything doubles. 

I think you have to add a sealed catheter to the guy, and a shit-tube, or else he will be living in his own excrement, which I don't imagine a person could long survive. He'll have to take vitamin d, because vitamin d is produced through the skin. Without the skin, I imagine he'll be a lot more prone to injury, since the skin cushions the insides somewhat. Molot raises a good point with keeping the blood fresh, but I see a couple of ways this could be done. Either the doctor produces it with stem cells/living bone marrow sample from the patient(a little sci-fi, but not too far off), or the tube is molded to the patient himself, and is just slightly larger than him, so not a huge amount of extra blood. As for CO2, It will bubble out(if the blood is exposed to the air at least occasionally. In fact, if you gave the blood enough surface area, you could let diffusion do all the work of providing oxygen, so he can't kill himself by taking off the mask. 

There is a chemical reaction (actually several reactions that all occur together) called the formose reaction that can produce sugars from formaldehyde. It is thought that this reaction might have occurred on the early Earth and played an important role in the origin of life. There might be a way to have the sugars produced by the formose reaction on your planet. The main difficulty is in coming up with a plausible source of formaldehyde. This paper says it can be produced from carbon dioxide and water under UV light, i.e. in the upper atmosphere. Presumably the main reasons this doesn't happen on Earth are the ozone layer, and the fact that having lots of oxygen in the atmosphere means that formaldehyde will rapidly be oxidised. I don't know for sure, but it might be possible that if your atmosphere is 20% oxygen and 80% CO2, and has plenty of water vapour, then you might be able to produce formaldehyde at a high enough rate that it won't all be oxidised. Then you could have sugars formed by the formose reaction inside water droplets in the atmosphere, which explains the sugary rain. The variability of sugar concentration would easily be explained by the fact that the formose reaction is quite slow and quite sensitively dependent on conditions, so the amount of sugar would depend quite strongly on how long the raindrops had been in the air, among other things. Some caveats are in order though. If you don't want photosynthesisers on your planet then oxygen is a bit of an issue. Although the reaction that produces formaldehyde from CO2 also produces oxygen, that oxygen will be used up by the metabolisms of the organisms that consume the sugars. You would need an additional, extra source of oxygen in order to maintain an excess. (Though as Richard Tingle points out in the comments, this could happen if some of the organic matter doesn't get metabolised back into CO2 and instead gets buried and subducted, leaving an excess of O2. This is exactly how it works on Earth.) Secondly, formaldehyde itself is quite poisonous to most (all?) organisms because it's quite reactive, and it's used as a disinfectant for that reason. The sugars from the formose reaction are also poisonous to humans, but I would not be surprised if some organisms can eat them. Similarly, an atmosphere with 80% CO2 would be lethal to most (all?) Earth animals, though plants and some microbes would be fine. So this planet's life might be somewhat Earth-like, but it would be adapted to this particular environment and most Earth life would not survive there. Another caveat is that the formose reaction is catalysed by metal ions, which means your rain would either have to be salty (it's hard to imagine how that could happen) or there would have to be some other catalyst available in your atmosphere. Finally, formaldehyde is not very stable in the presence of oxygen - pure formaldehyde is a flammable gas - so it's quite hard to imagine that formaldehyde and oxygen could co-exist in the same atmosphere. Overall, I don't think this scenario is particularly realistic or likely, but it might be just about in the bounds of possibility, and I couldn't resist putting it forward given the specifics of what you were asking for. 

Would the people become 10x heavier? If so, drowning becomes a serious risk, as these hypothetical humans would obtain a much smaller percentage of their needed swimming-force from their buoyancy, and being 10x stronger would not save them. (Ex. Suppose that normal humans are 10% denser than water, and are twice as strong as they need to be to tread. Aka, they can tread 2*10%= 20% of their own weight. Therefore, your hypothetical humans would also be able to tread 20% of their own weight, but now buoyancy only provides an additional 10% of their weight. Meaning they have only 30% of the necessary force, and are not nearly strong enough to swim). If the people stay roughly the same weight, then they become much more dangerous to each other and themselves. They can now jump about 3 times as high, greatly increasing the risk of landing badly. A toddler could easily push you out of a window. And it becomes impossible to subdue somebody without using weapons, as one small kick from them will launch you(and them) into orbit, meaning that cops and bouncers will favor the use of deadly weapons. 

This would very rapidly take humanity to a much higher female:male ratio. Since sex with pregnant women counts less, you need at least five women for every man, probably considerably more. It is quite possible that one sex will make a commodity the other. Certainly sex work will have the biggest boon in human history and become legitimate, since access to sex becomes a survival necessity. I wouldn't be surprised to find brothels in every supermarket. Effectively you're keeping women perpetually pregnant, which results in a massive population growth. You'd get about 60% increase globally every year: even converting all available land to high-intensity agriculture and the entire population living on GM rice, we'd exceed the Earth's total ability to feed us within a few years. To manage that I would expect the immediate, total and compulsory use of non-barrier contraception. I would think everybody would receive contraceptive implants, and probably some license system would be used give people a break from them and have children. Back of the envelope calculations suggest that there would be no stable population level, and humanity would be condemned to boom-bust cycles. The loss of barrier contraception would also massively increase the prevalence of STIs. That could cause people to form closed networks of sexual partners, with strict rules on health and fidelity, which in the long run could displace the family. Health, particularly mental health, will take a massive hit. LGBT people will be especially badly affected for obvious reasons. Monogamous relationships will effectively become impossible. People will become traumatised by the necessity of involuntary sex. Mental health problems will also suddenly carry a huge risk of death, since both problems and treatments are strongly associated with sexual problems. Last, but certainly not least, our concept of sexual consent will probably go out the window. An act is not a crime if it really is necessary for survival, so committing rape about one a month would be a valid lifestyle choice. 

The planet could be a giant prairie. Grass can grow, but not much else. Hence why humans have to eat grazing animals, instead of plants directly. Similarly, if humans rip up the prairie and plant crops, you get a dustbowl that grows out of proportion and destroys a everything. Or, whenever humans settle down in one place, endemic disease eventually destroys the population and forces a return to hunter-gathering. Edit: If you downvoted, why don't you take a trip down to your nearest grassland, and try and eke out a living by eating seeds, and then come back and tell me how easy it is. 

Assuming they don't land on the polar ice caps, in the middle of a desert, or during winter and an ice age, they can survive up to 430 million years ago, the approximate time period of the evolution of woody trees. So long as humans have wood to make spears, they can out-hunt any other predator in existence. Of course, I wouldn't say their survival is assured, but it seems likely. There are always animals to hunt, and there will be many, many more in a pre-human world. 

Humans who prefer to be completely alone are rare, but they exist. Perhaps with dragons it's the other way around: perhaps, very rarely, a dragon comes along who is outgoing and charismatic towards other dragons. With a sufficiently Machiavellian mindset, perhaps such an exceptional dragon could convince the other dragons to put aside their instinctive indifference to one another and unite as a single force. In order to do this it might be useful for this new dragon to have a scapegoat, an enemy for the dragons to unite against. Even if the human threat is not in reality all that credible or severe, the charismatic dragon might be able to drum up fear and resentment against them in order to achieve its aims. ("My fellow dragons, yet another of our number has been senselessly slain. How many more dragon lives must be lost before we put an end to the encroaching human menace once and for all," etc. etc.) Then the humans would suddenly find themselves under siege by a powerful force against which they are not really prepared to defend themselves - which might make for good drama if that's the sort of thing you're going for. 

I have some aliens. They look a bit like giant land-squid, and they have two very interesting characteristics. First off, their central nervous system never stops growing, so intelligence and age are well correlated, although in extreme old age when the brain has grown beyond the body's ability to support it dementia and death are inevitable. Second is their reproductive cycle. Beneath their mantles they have three "bud sites". If left vacant a new bud containing the individual's haploid genetic material will form. A bud kept in a bud site will stay viable for years, but without a host they only survive a few hours. They swap buds with each other, and when they're ready they close up their mantles and the three buds, as well as the gestational parent's own contribution, merge together and a baby thing is formed. So there are no distinct sexes, and everyone has four parents. As I imagine it, this makes reproduction like a gigantic trading card game. Individuals are constantly swapping buds (not necessarily even their own) to get desirable combinations of characteristics for their offspring. Offspring are raised by their gestational parent and may not even know who the other parents are. As an extension of all this I've imagined that their culture is based primarily around games and strategy, and historically their societies tend to be gerontocracies (although the age-intelligence correlation makes the distinction between gerontocracy and meritocracy rather fuzzy). My question is what happens to their society when their technology advances to provide for life-extension, intelligence augmentation, and the ability to store and preserve viable buds outside the body? More specifically, I'm thinking that their biology has given them a fairly natural social setup, but what sort of society might they end up with once those biological factors are mitigated by technological progress. If they're anything like us different groups will seize the opportunity to push for greater rights and equality, but on the other hand even though any natural reasons have gone certain things will be deeply embedded in identity and culture. I have some ideas, for example that success in games will become a more important factor than age in power structures, but I'm going all over the place and struggling to get much that's coherent so I wanted some fresh perspectives.
