Wouldn't a plausible explanation be "the only one in your list which even exhibits this is the anthropocentric one." 

Also, brains. Blacking out is inconvenient. A separate chamber or entire heart devoted purely to feeding blood to the brain seems like it would be useful anywhere that blood pressure to the head will often change significantly, whether by changing attitude (stand/lie), acceleration, or injury. So you could argue that Klingon-type warrior races would likely have brains protected by a very thick skull and a largely isolated blood supply, the better to survive in combat for longer; as might flying bipeds that pull high g-forces. 

When placing and naming civilization markers on a map, we can follow some basic rules. Where rivers reach the coast, there will typically be at least some amount of tidal estuary and delta, so the coast should angle in a little there; unlike most bays, these will be sharp rather than rounded. Urbintor is a good example. Humans live on the water, and on trade routes, so the first (and probably oldest) cities should go anywhere a river joins the sea, like Markal, Porlat, Kesidi, Mestas, and Urbintor again - great trade and fishing. River forks are also good places for trade and water, too, as well as being nicely defensible, protected on two sides by a natural "moat": in this map, this seems to be one of the main reasons for placing cities. There's a great sheltered bay with two rivers leading from it, leading to Bloodhill and Latale. This bay would normally become a huge city pretty fast, unless there's a good reason for it not to. Probably the biggest in that continent. Bays are caused by erosion from the sea, so will typically be rounded (no examples on this map), rather than pointy (Distad, Dalere, Vantia City, Turrum, Minra, Dongan, Montibem, Pordeut, Todora, Estreor, Porlaba, Eastport...), unless they are fjords between two mountain ranges. Fjords will typically end in at least a short river. Names mean things, and those things get used in multiple other names: in Pordeut, Porlaba, Porlat - I'd suspect that the "por" is a degradation of "port", and "lat" has some meaning, as it's also seen in Latale. Eastport shows the word non-degraded, showing regional differences, which is nice. The same region (Kingsland) has BloodHill - that region seems defined by readable Englishy names. My suspicion is that this will be where the heroes will start out, and venture into more foreign-sounding places. A bit tropey, if so, but not a terrible thing. Outside of that southern continent, though, names seem like just 2-3 random-syllable things, with no clear sign of meaning. Having several river-fork cities have a similar prefix or suffix (-ford, -bridge), and so on, will add verisimilitude: see $URL$ but obviously, like your "por-", make them regionalized to the tongues of your world, rather than using them directly. As a counterpoint to that, for a fiction writer, having names which are easily confused by the reader (bannockburn, bannockbridge) is usually a bad thing. I'd go with having the first syllable unique in each case, and shared suffixes, unless the point is to show the two places are very close together (bannockburn being just upriver from bannockbridge, perhaps). As well as rivers, other trade routes matter - places where major roads join, mountain passes, etc. Also significant sources of resources, like mining town, fishing villages (the whole coast would normally be populated with these before inland areas got many towns), etc. I like the placement of Erten & Estreor, placed to take advantage of the trade that flows down that channel from Gahotere and the Vanlian empire, to Kingsland and southern Aumedeszel. 

Theocracies rule in the Absence of Gods (or Absence of Interference by Gods, which can be hard to differentiate). A national government defines a social framework. Religion defines a social framework. While governments rule by the will of a group of people (that group never being all Ruled, mostly not even contemporaries of the Ruled). Theocracies rule by the Interpretation of Gods will by Priests. Now in a worlds with gods manifest, are there priests? Go into a library, buy a self- help book on contacting Zarg The Wholesome, and list Her your wishes. The ones that please Her get fulfilled, the others... don't please her. Now someone eats green peas in public. You don't like it. You go: "Zarg: is eating green peas ok with you?" No you don't. If Zarg dislikes green peas, there's literally infinitely many ways for a god to have known about it and done something about it. So now it's about you and the pea-eater. Gods do not have a stake in it. The conflict of interest is compleyely secular, and you are left with politics to achieve your will. Find people similarly bothered by peas, pass legislation, etc. . There might be some legislation about doing smiteable things in huge crowds, similar to bringing a gun to shoot youself in a big crowd, but mostly the governing will either take all gods into account, or not reference them at all. Think about gravity: No laws against letting things fall upwards, because thats covered by a great unyielding force. Lots of laws about not letting things drop on people, building stuff to code so it doesn' t drop on people, etc. You wouldn't calk that a Gravicrecy, would you? 

The true potential of exoskeletons has not yet been explored. Carrying stuff is the lamest (still valuable) use case. With an exoskeleton, you are now interacting with a host of computer controlled servos. 

Apocryphally, moss always grows on the northern side of the tree (well, in the northern hemisphere at least). If you actually go out and try this, you'll find it works as poorly as you would expect. Surveying a large number of trees you might be able to establish a side on which moss grows best. But is that because that side is to leeward, northern-exposure, pointing-uphillest, or something else? [Edit: thinking about it, that possibly doesn't matter, so long as it's not the last option. If the moss is consistently directional, then you can use it for making sure your path does not diverge, regardless of whether you know what direction you are traveling in. So I suppose this does answer the question as asked, even though there are far better responses in other answers. Sadly, things like leaf direction won't tell you the direction you expect the sun to be, since the light is diffuse. This fact may also affect the moss thing: direct sunlight would make the effect far stronger.] 

Display isn't computing, so Mars' laws can be dismissed as irrelevant. Individual policemen may argue that anything at all is a computer, but if it's the government putting these things in place, then the law matters, and those policemen's opinion does not. So on the face of it, the question can be simplified to one of various questions about electronics, suitable for electronics.se rather than worldbuilding.se. 1) If the question can be reduced to "what're CRT's resolution/size limits?" then the ViewSonic P225f was 2048x1536. Some online sources claim 2560x1920, but I suspect this was processing resolution, not display resolution. [Aside: while max display resolution and max processing resolution do not always match up, it is important to blithely ignore any people who claim that color CRTs lack an inherent native resolution, or in any way lack pixels. They are either confusing them with analog monochrome CRTs, are unaware of how the technology worked, or are using their own incorrectly nitpicky definitions of jargon terms like 'pixel' in order to try to be argumentative or look smart.] CRTs, because of the glass used around the sides of the tube, inherently mean big gaps in video walls, so you're limited by the max size of one "screen". These gaps can be ameliorated entirely with projection and compensation (at the cost of brightness), or with lenses (assuming the viewing angle is correct). 2) Perhaps instead the question can be reduced to "what're the resolution/size limits of non-digital displays?" After all, restricting to CRT makes little sense in terms of "computing". LCD, LED, etc are also non-computing, and can at least in theory make a video wall with no (or, negligible) gaps. A couple of mm at most. $URL$ may be a helpful resource: analog transmission and processing is limited mainly by bandwidth. Transmitting the signal over cable can entirely remove that limit, meaning that with enough cables, you could have an entire IMAX sized wall displaying video at 0.2mm dot pitch. That would be a fairly epic challenge, though. First, you'd need a camera that could capture it... but IMAX has shown this is possible on celluloud, which is analog. Then you'd need to split each celluloid image up into signals for many "little" screens, and transmit the signal for each mini-screen on the wall. 3) But I think what the question actually meant "what're the resolution/size limits of displays that use no integrated circuits" particularly given the example given: the Portacolor was US' last valve TV produced, not the last CRT TV. However, this still reduces to one of the two earlier options, as valves became redundant only due to their size, power requirements, cooling requirements, cost, unreliability, and other flaws. Their switching speed and other capabilities were never the issue, and were improving as constantly as ICs have. Moore's law was invented before Integrated Circuits. 

Time flies like arrows because they are fast moving elongated objects that move axially. Slow moving stuff is incredibly big in the time-dimension, fast moving stuff is small in that aspect. (Think about measuring one of the three space-dimensions of a house, by walking by it, and calling out whether the house is beside you. One step: Still there. Two steps: Still there...... Thirty steps: now ist gone! Same for time: Go forward in time (meaning stand still and exist), and call out whether the object beside you is there: second 1: There. second 2: There. ... second 123134: Still there. It's a house. Gonna take awhile. Now sit there while an arrow flies by (and remember: Time flies are tiny, so they don't see so good. Stuff needs to be near them to appreciate it. No knobbly stuff either, moving knobbly stuff to a time creature is like a rapidly expanding and contracting monster. Scary. Nice, smooth arrows: Great. You sit near them, the view alters, soothing like staring at a tumble-dryer (which they like second best). Modern aluminium-shafts with paint on it? bliss. Practically like TV. 

Edit prompted by comment of L.Dutch, to better reflect the question. Apex-predatoryness and dominance are two largely unlinked concepts. Consider the Great White sharks: We are total a**holes to them, but that is not because we want to eat them (no appreciable part of them anyways) - we want them as trophies, we fear them, we are bored, we are wasteful - sharks die. Humans, even if they were complete herbivores, would still be humans (otherwise why call them humans? If you think herbivore bipedal beings would be bovine, docile, whatever, you conflate predatordom with other traits that in reality do not follow). Societies are mostly products of very specific circumstances: The Aztecs seem to have had a very different society from the early SriLankan societies, yet they were on a similar tech level, had comparable climates, and biologically near-identical human beings to work from (and both hat man-eaters in their biome). ---- there are several current communities that are located in biomes that contain man-eaters: there are still tigers and lions about. Apart from some technicalities about going out alone after dark, the traits those communities exhibit are not statistically more different compared to non-threatened communities than non-threatened comunities are among each other. Humans would have killed most of the apex predators above them in the food-net (not eaten them - that would have made them apex predators themselves), saved a few for the zoos and then wondered that they withered and died. Humans would overwhelm with numbers, poison, trick, burn, trap and generally bring their whole lethality to bear until no appreciable predator was left in the adjacent food-net. Higher numbers of Great Whites would survive, because humans don't live in the ocean. ---- The only weapon humans would not be able to bring to bear is the outcompeting of other predators - to starve them we'd have to cull the prey of those predators without direct nutritional gain to ourselves. I think we'd manage (\s) Why am i writing "would"? Humans did. Sabretooths, Cave bears, they all went extinct, not because we absolutely wanted to eat them, but because that made the neighborhood safer. Sure, there are stil a few man-eaters around, and every once in a while humans do get eaten, but it's rare. --- Not eating meat does not equate not being capable of seeing blood - elephants are strict herbivores, but if angered they will crush a fool. --- Warfare is intra-species violence that has (in humans) nothing to do with nutrition-by-foe. It has to do with ressources, with societal pressures, but it is not about eating your enemy - so that aspect of humans would also stay. Look at herbivores fighting for a good spot on the grass, or a sexual partner - there is nothing specific to carnivores in terms of violence. Now if your question was what would have happened if humans were not the dominant species of intelligent community builders - and the other species was carnivore, while humans were not - that's a completely different question, the answer to which will completely depend on the exact traits of the dominant species you envisage - they will shape the ecological niches that humans then would compete for; You'd also have to explain how humans evolved as humans - we can power that wasteful brain of ours, because "big-brains" is the ecological niche we dominate - in the long run there always is just one species per ecological niche, that is what makes it a niche. 

You, a gentleman from the 1800s, discover a strange flat silver box, with a hinge at the front (or so it appears form the image of a fruit on the lid). $URL$ Under the lid, where you might expect to see a tray of chocolates, you see a tray of letters and symbols, randomly arranged. Perhaps you recognize the alphabet, but if so, it is scrambled, and placed in the middle of the tray, facing away from the hinge. The letters appear fixed in place - trying to remove one with your fingers, it pops down as if on springs. They could be mechanical buttons, but none, at first glance, appear functional. If you have experience with typewriters, you might intuitively get the concept of keys; otherwise, you will at least understand the concept of buttons and an alphabet. Below the buttons is a faint recess, such as one might rest a small lithographic print or business card into, but unfortunately there is none there: it is empty. At the sides are various holes of various shapes, five on one side and three on the other. One looks like a coinslot, the others are squarish and go in to various depths, some having golden metal springs within. On further investigation, one button, the one on the top-right, appears to be a toggle, making an illuminated image of a beach appear and disappear from the inside of the lid. When the beach is shown, so too is a small rectangle in the middle of that picture, containing the text "enter password". Most of the buttons at that point add a dot to the box, the exceptions being: 

Unfortunately, it's a serial device, and the drivers aren't compatible with anything even if you manage to get one and a serial port adapter. [If anyone's super interested in this, $URL$ has a great writeup about getting it working with newer hardware... while the OrbShield adapter is now called the orbotron, available at $URL$ maybe (been a while since that site was updated)]
