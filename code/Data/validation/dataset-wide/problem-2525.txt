I don't know if there is a answer to this. But I would think it is more common sense. It really depends on you're doing. Some acts require careful before it is done. A little thought before speaking to a person, or if you're doing something like writing or programming, which are mental skills, is good. Since you mentioned and Bruce Lee, I'd say martial arts has a way of repetitive action, in other words, a combination of moves being practised repeatedly, so that it just occurs naturally. Going with the flow is crucial. Now, or in the middle of that, may cause you to check the action unnecessarily when it is going correctly, consequentially the occurs, which may be detrimental, in that context. That's why all the thinking is done before-hand in martial arts practice, and unbroken, smooth repetition is of paramount importance. (Commenting on movies would be inessential here. I'd advise you to take anything you hear in them with a pinch of salt. The dialogues may be used for rather than ) In conclusion, it really depends on the situation you're in. Be present in the moment and do mindfully what the situation entails. If you're sitting in meditation practice, and letting go would help because that's the whole point of meditation. The mind's activity needs to be calmed, if I may say so. That's where and letting go helps. In regular activities, just know where you are, be alert and aware of what you're doing, that is mindfulness. And the effect is that you're able to do things more productively (which is generally a good thing). 

Why not? Simply read? Take what you feel is right? There are many explanations. You may be mislead. That's why I said simply read. Don't stop yourself from reading/exploring. But why should you get carried away by what's in the books of a person? Most importantly, start reading your own life. Look at what's happening to you in situations, how you react, how you respond, what you are doing. Take conscious actions. That will give you more than enough knowledge on what you need than all the books in the world. 

Thus it may have been under Manjushri's guidance that Je Tsongkhapa adopted this order. You are of course right about the order in which the Lamrim points are presented is different in the various Lamrims. While Jowo Je Atisha used Bodhichitta as the first step on the path, Gampopa in his "Jewel Ornament of Liberation" begins with Buddha Nature. While Patrul Rinpoche begins "The Words of My Perfect Teacher" with the precious human life. Atisha begins his Lamrim after explaining the three scopes with the following verse: For these excellent beings Who aspire to supreme enlightenment, I shall explain the perfect method Taught by my spiritual masters. Thus the Lamp on the Path to Enlightenment is primarily addressed to Mahayana practitioners and thus generating the Spirit of Enlightenment is the first step he presents. Gampopa has a very interesting presentation in "Jewel Ornament of Liberation". Buddha Nature is the primary cause, the precious human life is the working basis while reliance on a spiritual master is the contributory cause. Patrul Rinpoche's combines 'Reliance on a Spiritual Master' together with generating the spirit of enlightenment and development of Bodhichitta. One of my teachers has explained that the above are three levels of refuge and Patrul Rinpoche uses it as the preliminaries before the introduction of Mahamudra, Chod and Transference teachings. Since the Lamrim Chenmo is a sutric text it does not go into the tantra except towards the end where Je Tsongkhapa mentions that the disciple has to practice the teachings of the Vajrayana before undertaking the four methods of gathering disciples. However the Vajrayana is a part of the entire path and thus from Je Tsongkhapa's point of view the preliminaries should include guru devotion. This is explained further in Panchen Chyoki Gyaltsen's 'Easy Path' where each section is divided into the preliminary, the actual meditation session and time in between sessions. This format is adopted by Kyabje Pabonka Rinpoche as well in 'Liberation in you Hands'. In the preliminary, is the primary practice of Guru Yoga and supplication which helps you understand the meditation topic better. Thus in the Gelug Lamrims following Tsongkhapa the importance on the Reliance on the Spiritual Master being the root of the path is emphasised. This can be best explained by the benefits of relying upon a spiritual master as found in the Precious Master's Instructions Outline to the Lamrim. The eight benefits of relying on spiritual masters: * Coming closer to achieving Buddhahood * Pleasing all conquerors * Being invulnerable to demons and misleading friends * The automatic reduction of disturbing mental factors and incorrect behaviour * The increase of all grounds, paths and realisations * Never being deprived of a teacher in all future lives * Not falling into lower rebirths * Effortlessly achieving all temporary and ultimate goals 

To an extent, you have to see patterns. What they did, how things happened, etc., But spiritual path is a very subjective process, your internal nature as it has happened by your past accumulations and external circumstances. It is about YOU. Unconscious and conscious mental/physical impressions have played a large part in how you are right now. One more thing, please don't split yourself up into parts like , etc., It is all a mental construct. Throw it away. You are one person. Please be that first, and start from there. 

In your current social context maybe it is safe to shy away from religious talk considering people may be religious bigots. But you may also want to reel them in on their religion and attitude. And as for such talk about other religions having more women or whatever, you can just dismiss it for yourself. Sometimes it may be wise to not try and penetrate the other person's ignorance. You may prick the ego instead. And that's dangerous. And one more thing, Buddhism has certain practices and goals. And that must be all. Try not to identify too much with it or defend it. Know for yourself that you are going on the path you feel is right. 

So, let's get this straight. If you get an answer of how Karma works for the particular situation you're mentioning, OR any answer at all as to how Karma works, then you may be lead the wrong way. Because you need to understand that all this is NOT true in your experience. It won't make a difference. You may ask the question and somebody may give you an answer. You can either choose to believe or disbelieve that answer. But, consider this. What is the truth? Will you be closer to the truth by either believing it or disbelieving it? Contemplate this. And then these questions will probably stop coming up because you can see the futility. 

Upasaka Kalpesh Mange, as told be others here, it's at large distruction for the mind, and given your intent here, you should best be sure about it. How ever, even for monks, while my person nevertheless likes to give much appreciation to it, musik or singing, that increases or gives rise to samvega, is not unskilfull perse. For serious lay people the use of what is called smot, a special style of singing and proper text, is very usuall here in south east asia, and a specially used on occations of going forth, to increase gratitude toward parents. Usually giving a possible liberating lake of tears, being about suffering and taking leave at most. But also this can become a distacting issue, if clinging on the pleasure of sound and certain upcoming emotions. Singing yourself (even in mind), even if smot, especially when monk, is not as skilfull to be seen, and hardly bring on a base where it does not gets against certain precepts, if taken. So, as mostly everywhere, one is also left alone here, to be honest about ones intent.

If seeing that certain things are easy misleading, not having real base in Buddhas teaching, especially for Beginners, till Awakening, it's good to throw such simply FAR away, and such to do, reasonable, after probe, althought it might look aversive, is actually good and leads minimum to heavenly states as effect. If wishing to understand of what the Buddhas way of use of a very needed duality is, to reach the unconditioned, the importance of wise discrimination, not foolish deciding to run away in a pseudo-nonduality, eg simply ignorance, The Road to Nirvana Is Paved with Skillful Intentions and Virtue without Attachment might be good starter. Watch out how the "no-dual" Zenis will react on the answer, to get the message. In regard of feelings, it's right that pleasant as well as unpleasant feelings are suffering as well, it's just missed that neither-pleasant-nor-unpleasant feelings have this as well. Why? Because (the hide in) ignorance is not lasting. As for deeds by mind, speech and body, there are skillful and unskillful, and yes, skillful often are not pleasing, because burdensome seen, connected with letting go and give.

It really depends upon the level of the disciple. The Buddha taught different stages of understanding of reality and each progressively works on adding subtlety to the understanding of reality. In the First Turning of the Wheel of Dhrama, the Buddha taught about the five aggregates and how they are impermanent and the self itself is impermanent. He went on to explore the self and how it cannot be found as one with the aggregates or separate from the aggregates thus expounding the concept of selflessness. Then in the Second Turning of the Wheel of Dharma, the Buddha taught the perfection of wisdom where he refuted the existence of even the five aggregates. However since these were two rather extreme views, the Buddha taught in the Third Turning of the Wheel of Dharma about the view that things exist in the mind-only. The above is a rather simplistic essence, but what the Buddha was doing during the three turnings was introducing the nature of reality from the less subtle to the most subtle understanding. We have to realize, that we may not be ready for the most subtle understanding of reality just yet and have to work our ways up the levels of subtlety. Sometimes it does help to look at metta as truly existing. At times it helps to look at a basal consciousness and karmic imprints as existing. It can also help by looking at conventional and ultimate reality as two modes. Or you may be better of looking at the Madhayamika Prasangika view of the absence of inherent existence and the reality that is solely based on dependant origination. So to answer your question if metta is real, the best way to look at it would be from understanding your own understanding and how it corresponds to the four schools of tenets and working the way up. $URL$ 

It is not that there is no self. There is no self in the way you think of a self. That is, there in nothing inherent in what you refer to as "I". When you understand this, you free yourself and your actions are able to transcend limits. With this understanding, your actions become perfections. Which is why everything you do should be with an understanding of selflessness.
