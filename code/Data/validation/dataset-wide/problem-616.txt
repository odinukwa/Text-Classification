The broad design is easy enough, I can get ordinary wheels from the local racing/historical scene. It's the drive and handling that concern me. I suspect I will need an adder-subractor gearbox to balance the pedal power and allow it to be ridden solo, but I've never built one except using Lego so I'm not sure how big it'll need to be. I'd really appreciate tips from people who've built one before. 

I can't speak for every hydraulic brake ever, but when I've done this I didn't worry about it, I just bought sealed brakes and put them on. I'm currently running cheap Shimano ones on my touring bike and have not had any issues, and in the past I used Hayes with similar lack of problems. 

Have you tried removing the stem so you have better access to the wedge? Often if you do that you can screw the bolt in and pull the wedge out, then reassemble it away from the bike. The other approach is to again lift the stem out, remove the front wheel, then turn the bike over and push the wedge out from the fork side. If you have a front mudguard you will need to remove that too, but almost always the bottom of the steerer tube is open so you can get the stem bolt or another long, thin object against the wedge and push it out that way. You may need to hammer it a bit, so preferably use a long punch or spare bolt, rather than the stem bolt that you need to make it all work. 

You should definitely check the gear shifting regularly. I'd say monthly, or whenever you notice that it's not as easy or definite as you'd like. That means popping the outers off the frame, sliding them along the cables and making sure there's no grit or fraying. Then lube them. Doing that will kill the fine adjustment of the gears, so you need to get the cables back to their neutral position - go for a quick ride and shift a lot. 5 minutes, not half an hour. Then adjust your gears properly. You may be able to do that on the bike, or you may need a workstand. But do it after a quick ride, not immediately after the cables have been worked on. Same thing with the brakes. I'm going to assume disk brakes. With cable brakes, check the pad wear every 20-ish hours of riding and the brake lever travel whenever you get on the bike. Adjust the brakes so the travel is right if it's not. If the pads are worn, even "oh, there's enough there", fit your new pads and order a replacement set. Always have a spare set of pads at home, because that way you know you always have them. When that model is discontinued you want to know before your bike becomes unrideable (ie, when you just fitted your last pair of pads, not when that pair wears out). Ditto wheels. When you're adjusting something and the wheel is spinning, make sure the wheel is round and rotates easily. That way you'll catch broken spokes and worn wheel bearings early on. New wheel bearings are cheap, new races can mean replacing the hub. Your call :) Whenever you service anything, look at how worn it is. Wiggle it. If you've adjusted it recently, think about why it's not staying adjusted - either you're doing it wrong or something else has happened. Have bearings worn and now have play? Is there a crack in the frame opening up that's "shortening" your brake or gear cables? Has a washer or bolt fallen out? Has the derailleur or hanger been bent so many times it's about to break? Until you know, don't just assume you mis-adjusted something last time. The previous advice of paying a bike mechanic just because they are a second set of eyes and don't have the "I'm lazy, I can leave that for later" issue is sound. 

That's specific to the type of light and how it's mounted. The only general advice is "make sure it has a proper mount and is installed correctly". Of course, for may lights the answer is "it did not come with a proper mount". For your fork bridge mounted dyno light the mounts are often cheap steel and if you're lucky there will be a fold or two to strengthen it in places. Those usually end up not working very well. If the light slips around on the mounting bolt that's usually easy to fix. Get a locking nut and if necessary a longer bolt so you can fit it. The nut you want is deeper than a normal nut and has a plastic insert to make it less likely to come undone. They're cheap, so most bike shops will buy a box of 100-200 for 5c-20c each (more for stainless steel ones) and charge you 20c-50c for one. Your call as to whether $10 for a box is worth it. If you are right on the end of the bolt don't fart round with removing washers, just buy a longer bolt. Most cities have an industrial fastener shop, find it or use an online one (but $5 shipping on $1 of bolts... ow). 

It's a wrench that will work on a range of different size nuts and bolts. Each step on the top ramp will grab a different size. A further advantage is that it will work equally well (or badly) on four sided nuts, and on five and seven sided "security" bolts that a conventional adjustable wrench with parallel jaws will not work on. It will not work especially well, but it's a one-piece equivalent to a proper adjustable wrench, which in turn will not work as well as a proper set of spanners. They're made because they're cheap, light, and easy to manufacture. Edit: found the ad on ebay and it has another image: 

Double taping or double wrapping is definitely common, and as with all things bicycle there are various opinions on the best way to do it. I do it mostly for comfort, although as with many others I do have hands big enough to comfortably hold the bars when they're bulked up like that (I'm using two layers of foam tape rather than an under-layer of cotton tape). I'm not sure there's much advantage to using a layer of non-padded tape, but if it works for you go for it. It's easy enough to remove, so at worst you've lost whatever you paid for the tape. What I usually do is buy bargain-bin tape for the bottom layer because no-one sees it, and I'll often wrap top-down because I think that works better. I don't tuck the first set of tape into the bar at the bottom, only the outer layer starts tucked in. And I'll often run the outer layer a turn further up towards the stem so it's anchored onto the bar rather than just the first layer of tape. I get that extra tape by only wrapping round the brake levers as little as possible (ie, I don't do the extra figure-8 around the levers), partly because the extra padding often spoils the feel of the levers.
