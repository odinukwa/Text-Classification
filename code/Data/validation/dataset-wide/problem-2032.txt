My approach to this kind of problem is to ensure there is sufficient methodology and tooling in place to make the issue technical and not personal. For example, make sure you have automated builds and smoke tests. If these get broken, have a rule that the breaker must provide food at the next team meeting. Sometimes people will just boldly challenge the status quo in a selfish quest for personal progress. In a way, this is normal. It is entrepreneurial at best. The individual is moving forward in a framework that permits it. So, change the framework. Those types of people will not be thwarted, they will make progress in different ways. So as a manager your aim is to harness that spirit and direct it in a way that is positive for the team and the aims. Part of that strategy of harnessing will is to make sure people still feel a sense of ownership. The most popular answer here thus far advocates a philosophy of renunciation of ownership. I think this may be counterproductive. Let people passionately own their area. But make sure they do not trespass others'. 

Do exactly as you wish. If you want a job where you can yawn when tired and dress as you wish, keep being exactly as you are, without compromise. If you feel you were unfairly treated, then screw them. You win. You avoided being treated like a monkey later. Hey this is a short answer but in a nutshell this is all you need to know. 

I would just get really riled with the coworker and tell them loud and plain that you can't work with the blind open and to damn well shut it when I come back in the room. If this doesn't work, get hold of a big mirror, preferably a fresnel lens, and point it so when s/he opens the blind,their monitor melts. This would be an interim fix until I boot management up the backside with a 'fix this before I call health and safety inspectors' warning. 

I would tell my old employer that they should have kept me closer in the loop. Beyond that, if this investment round is make or break for them, I would say that I had no idea I was so critical, explain I should have been told, and demand equity and access to the business plan in order to stay on. Another route I would consider is whether or not the two businesses could synergise. If so, I would suggest that a solution could be an overlap period where you work on something useful to both businesses while taking double pay. I have been in a similar situation a few times and my experience is that a) you should never walk on a project you committed to b) you should leave employers for new ones if the pay is higher and conditions better long term, where you are not on a contracted project 

In Central Europe in IT it is expected that you join on a lower salary and undergo a trial period. In IT this can easily be 12 month, especially for a junior. To then expect a rise is normal. There is no logical implication that this would imply an annual rise. Since the financial crisis CPI inflation rarely has any effect on salary. The contrary. Since the crisis, the biggest effect on salaried employee living costs is consumer debt interest rates which have dropped annually. CPI inflation is much lower than asset price inflation. 

I was hired at the beginning of the year with a good salary and perks. However, my motivation droped seriously after a couple of weeks, seeing how my boss works. I felt I made too much efforts to obtain basic information to complete a task. Nonetheless, I took a morning off due to some paperwork, my boss immediately took new measures against me (thinking I had a job interview). Later on, I didn't really understand why my boss extended my probation, after having praised my work a little before. A couple of weeks later, she came to me during evaluation period and did set my next year's objectives. She did assign to me a big task a month ago, and I am almost done with it, and I need her inputs about some elements. However, she seems distant and doesn't give too much importance to what I do. Plus, she has not assigned any new tasks for what it is to be next. I feel there is some contradiction, why should she present new year's objectives, and in the mean time be distant and not marginalizing me? Should I be a little patient and see what will happen? Or should I resign right away (I have secured an old job but with a lower salary)? 

A couple of weeks ago, I lost internet connection at the end of a monday, on my workstation. Next day, the connection was not back, so I had to contact helpdesk. They brought the connection back, but I couldn't connect to some websites (I usually launch some video on youtube with lowest quality and merely listen while I am fulfilling my work). Checking with colleagues, everybody had access, Youtube included. How should I take this measure against me? 

My probationary period was extended last week, all the sudden, two weeks before due date. The official reason was that I didn't work on an unclear task I couldn't do, and due to my "senior" status, I should be able to do it. I haven't had enough time to learn enough, nor did I work on that specific component to investigate the source of the problem. This problem exists since many years and no one could solve it (it happens randomly under unclear conditions/parameters etc.). The unspoken reason is that I didn't contact my boss to inform her about the status of a previous task. My boss is sometimes absent without prior notice nor does she bother to reveal the duration of her absence. I don't like this new job because we work without any methodology. When someting wrong happens, she keeps telling me: I gave you (verbally) the information yesterday (no documents, nothing written --> high risk of confusion) - my colleagues tell me "tell her yes, you are right". My problem with her is that when I was proactive, she shut me down, and now that I am being passive, she doesn't like it. At the end of last week, I could see she was not happy because she could see my office was empty (already prepared my bags - I don't like my new job either, but I have to cope with it). She kind of marginalized me lately, or maybe wanted me to be more proactive as before. She gave me a long tedious mechanical task (I had to produce +6000 lines of hard coded values). While executing this task, I was wondering: "is she punishing me?" When I called her to tell her I was done, she sounded energetic and positive. However, I heard she has a hard time keeping subordinates, as she usually get into conflicts even people with soft personalities. Am I losing this job? Is she inciting me to look for another job? 

The problem here is that the approach the customer is proposing is backwards and awkward. The IT team should be asking you for guidance on how to resolve the issue. You trying to navigate their internal IT department and find someone to do this is obnoxious for you and them. The person you are in touch with is confused about how things work. Instead of making it into a battle around what is and isn't your job, just guide them on how to get things done. "Please work with your IT team to contact me(/my team) with regards to this problem. I will provide them with the information they need to resolve this issue. Thanks." Once you get someone who knows something and can do something about it, things should go more smoothly. NOTE: It's of some concern that you have access to their servers if it's not your job to administrate them. If you don't administer these servers, you do not need access and therefore should not have it from a security perspective. 

I take it that this is your first job out of school. It's a rough time and since you don't have any experience to draw on, it can be a little unnerving when someone takes advantage of your newness. If I were you, my first step would be to get some intel on this guy. Do you have any friends in the company yet? Do you feel good about your manager? I imagine this must be a fairly small company since the CEO is personally handling the hiring of someone at your level. This guy must have some sort of reputation by now. You should start asking people you trust "what's with [insert freak's name here]?" And tell them (in confidence) what he's been saying to you. If you don't have any friends at work, make some. In the meantime, you might want to ask him what he wants from you. From what I can tell in your post, there doesn't seem to be any point to these conversations other than you intimidate you. I would try to come across as casually bored by these conversations but start asking questions like "is there a point to this?" I had a coworker at my first 'real' job that would take it upon himself to put me down, one-up me, or minimize my achievements regularly. Years on, I think he was just threatened by me. I worked with him for maybe a year but it felt like a long time. My guess is that this is what you are dealing with. The best thing to do is be the adult and act confidently. 

The term "man-hours" is a somewhat antiquated and it does carry some baggage but you shouldn't take too much offense. The continued use of it is really not any more sexist than the term "manhole". Can a woman go into a manhole and does she feel less welcome in the sewer because of the name of the entrance? That said, this is being replaced over time. You could advocate something more specific based on the kind of work. If you are in software, you can use terms 'developer-hours' or 'dev-hours' vs 'arch-hours' to distinguish the kind of work. Another option is to change to 'days' and while you are at it call them 'person-days'. 'Man-days' sounds strange. It's really hard to measure how many hours of work a given person has put in. One man's hour might not accomplish as much as given woman's hour, for example. On the other hand, there is no ambiguity around when a day has passed and how many days are left until a deadline arrives.
