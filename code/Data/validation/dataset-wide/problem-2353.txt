You shouldn't use biners to attach to the rope for the same reasons you don't do it when attaching to the end of a rope: It pointlessly adds another point of failure (and uses more gear). 

Important disclaimer: I am not a medical doctor, all of the following is based on knowledge acquired from climbing courses and experience. Therefore I will keep it general, but take anything with a grain of salt (as you should with anything considering your health from unknown sources). Hangboarding and campusing are extremely dangerous to your fingers. As a beginner I would not recommend using them. When you want to start using them, get advice from someone experienced. There are some general points you should follow: 

and the length of the cordelette is 1. Derivation/Final Conditions Now lets define the positions of these points at the end of one pulling iteration and denote them by adding a "'". This end is defined by the prusik/B meeting the biner that redirects the rope (yellow). In this position the cordelette is exactly folded in halves: 

Little excursion up front: If you have problems with joints or back when jumping down, do not ignore that. Either you already have a significant problem with those areas, in which case you should consult a health professional, or more likely you don't land properly. Even with mats, good landing technique is very important to save your body. That's out of scope of this question, but you could google for Judo/Jiu Jiutsu falling techniques (in a simplified manner work very well) or ask another question. Most important thing about down-climbing is exercise: It isn't technically very hard, one just hardly ever does it and thus generally pretty much sucks at it. Think back to when you started climbing. So do easy routes and climb them down. This is also a great warm-up or endurance (on a little harder routes) training. My go to warm-up for the trainings I give are general purpose core and should exercises alternating with climbing one easy bouldering route up and down. Just doing that before training will improve your down-climbing tremendously. As to specific things to look out for when down-climbing: 

First of all if you are really interested in tying your shoes, check out Ian's Shoelace Site. All credit for the imagery used here and most of the information given goes to the author Ian Fieggen. For me the requirements to my shoelace knot are the same as yours (and probably most of everyone's): Secure but still quick to tie and untie. The Double Shoelace Knot you mentioned is very common but in my opinion completely useless. It is not more secure than a simple knot. It is just a simple knot done twice, so it has the get undone twice. Plus it is cumbersome to open. The one knot I use is a slight variation from the Better Bow Shoelace Knot. Until the following step you do it the same way: 

Method using one single rope You obviously tie in on one end, the partner which climbs best on the other end. The weaker partner ties in at a save distance from the end. The exact distance is always a compromise between available rope length and safety margin between climbers. The one in the middle can be tied in using a variety of knots, I prefer an overhand secured by a double fisherman's knot. The weaker one starts climbing and the second one follows as soon as the rope in between them is almost taught. If the first falls, this does not affect the second. But if the second falls, he will pull the first off the rock. Advantages: 

As a general rule of thumb: Never use static material only as protection while moving. Unless you anyway know what you do, I suggest you stick to that rule. There are several examples of fatal accidents involving static falls of very short distance into your binding, which then broke. Fall factors are not a factor to consider, as this compares length of fall to length of rope which will dynamically brake, while here there is nothing dynamic. Even if the material holds, such a static fall causes injuries or at least severe pain in the hip region (I know, I once fell about 0.5m into a daisychain while aiding, two connections ripped and thus damped the fall, it still hurt a lot and caused me to abandon the climb. However in the exact case shown above when slipping, you would not fall directly into the sling. Scraping over the rocks you would not be very fast when the sling stops you, so it would not be comfortable, but hardly hazardous. Still the best method in such terrain would be going on short rope. If properly done and trained you are safer and faster than with such improvised protection, but it really needs some practice. You are connected with about 10m of rope and the stronger climber goes ahead. In very easy and hardly exposed terrain you simply go simultaneously managing the rope so that it does not get in the way. On slightly harder or exposed terrain the leader places the rope over spikes on the go, thus providing security against falling off completely. In case it gets much harder you secure the second (e.g. wrapping the rope twice around a suitable spike) and you climb the section, then you belay the second up with again a spike or shoulder belay (this is a direct translation from German, no idea whether it is the correct term in English). 

This might depend on the area. At least in Switzerland the answer is simple: You can use them for planned overnight stays. They are usually just a small part of the entire hut with none to rudimentary to quite luxury cooking/heating facilities. Their size and equipment present varies greatly between different huts. Most SAC huts have one though. You should usually contact the "hut person" in advance, both for reserving (he can tell people if it is to be expected that too many mountaineers go there - this is usually not pleasant) and to receive sometimes vital information (e.g. where/which door is the entrance in case you have to shovel it free of snow). Please follow the usual guidelines: Leave the place in equal or better state than you found it. Pay the fees and usually make an entry in the hut book - maintaining a hut involves lots of work and money. According to Wills and Tullochgorum (thanks) this works more or less the same way in Austria, Italy and France. 

The problem will be that both the terms/activities "dynamic climbing" and "mountaineering" are quite broad. Strictly speaking the answer is yes: You sometimes use dynamic climbing in mountaineering, as there are routes that you cannot do entirely statically. However this is not very helpful and even misleading, so I will try to give a broader view in the following. TLDR: You don't often climb dynamically, as not falling is the priority when mountaineering and the risk of falling is inherently bigger when climbing dynamically. However you will sooner or later come across something, that is only or more easily done dynamically, so it does not hurt knowing how to climb dynamically. I personally define static climbing as a movement during which you could stop and hold that position at any time. This is nothing official and rather strict. On ice I never heard of dynamic movements being used in mountaineering except for special cases and people pushing the limits. In ice climbing the paradigm is "do not fall" and climbing dynamically goes against that. On snow you generally don't climb but walk, so I wouldn't know how dynamic movement applies there. On rock you quite frequently use dynamic climbing when considering this strict definition, as it can be much more efficient. E.g. reaching a hold in a kind of swing while all three other extremities are still on steps/holds is perfectly save, but needs less body tension and pulling with your arm. Still you will only do this when you are certain the next hold is good and/or you are in easy terrain without big consequences of a fall. The big difference between rock climbing and climbing rock while mountaineering is usually the protection: In rock climbing you protect in a way that you can fall without (serious) injuries, in mountaineering you can or want, due to time constraints, often only protect in a way that prevents a the entire team to fall as far as the mountain goes down (ugly description, in German we call it a "Totalabsturz"). So as in ice climbing, falling is not really an option in mountaineering. This means you take less risks while climbing and therefore tend to climb much more statically. As for the moves you stated explicitly: Jumping to a hold (dyno) and swinging is not something you do in mountaineering on a regular basis, as both inherently carry the risk of missing the next hold/foot and thus falling. Nevertheless you might come across a situation where you need it, e.g. when having to jump over a gap or only having good holds but the rock below is blank. But as I said, that's not something you encounter regularly. 

There are many phrases that you will find concerning dry treatment of ropes, but they can all be easily related to your three categories: non-dry rope This rope has no treatment to repel water. Consequently it absorbs the most water and thus getting heavier. Wet ropes also loose some of their dynamic properties, so falls will get harder. As it is the cheapest variant, it is well suited for indoor climbing and also fine for sports climbing (you usually don't sport climb in heavy rain). dry rope The sheath of this ropes has a dry treatment. This means that the individual fibres are treated to repel water. As the sheath is on the outside, this is already a good protection against water. This is a goto rope for any multi-pitch, alpine climbing and mountaineering (except in case of heavy icing, see below). dry core rope Both the sheath and the core fibres are dry treated. This is an additional protection against water that may pass the protected sheath. As the core has much more fibres than the sheath, this is more expensive. This rope is for ice-climbing and mountaineering in mixed conditions. In those activities it is pretty much possible for a wet rope to freeze which makes it unusable, so it is vital it stays dry. 

When I am trad-climbing (actually generally when rock-climbing), I carry 60cm (shoulder length) and 120cm slings. Some 60cm slings set up as alpine draws, the rest over my shoulder. When setting up a belay station, 60cm slings tend to be too short. When using a double boolean as central point, that uses already most of the sling length. Further, when abseiling, I use 120cm slings in the following setup: Girth hitched parallel to the belay loop (alternatively directly into the belay loop), then a knot (eight, butterfly) at about a third of its length. Thus the autoblock cant reach the abseiling device. The remaining loop in front of the knot I use as self belay sling. Thus when I reach the next belay station, I can immediately secure my self. Another small benefit for the forgetful: While abseiling, you can clip the self belay biner into the rope, that you will pull down afterwards. I do not see, what the problem of loading the sling at the knot should be. Even if you dislike it, you can simply adjust the girth hitch such, that the knot is not at the end. Both eight knots and butterfly knots can handle ring loads. If you are using a dyneema sling, the knot can slip, but very slowly. This means that under constant load the knot may creep upwards, but I never saw this being the case when abseiling. Burning trough is anyway not a problem in this setup, as a slipping knot will not concentrate the friction heat to one point. Method 1 could be adjusted in the way, that you take your sling in a double loop and girth hitch it to the belay loop. 

I suppose you mean outside of village, so you are talking about streams and sources. In any alpine areas (France, Italy, Switzerland, Austria) I drink water unfiltered when I assume that there are no alps (place with cattle during summer) upstream, which worked for me. Of course you usually cannot be 100% sure about it, but almost so. If there is cattle upstream, you have a quite a chance of getting diarrhea. I did it twice until now when I was just too thirsty and once came to regret that decision :) Many people attribute diarrhea to glacier water, which I cannot confirm. Unless you drink it constantly, the lack of minerals is not a problem either. For dwells in towns in Switzerland you can drink always unless there is a sign telling you otherwise. Sometimes such a sign is present as the water is not officially tested, that also very often the case in alpine huts, while the water is fine. But you cannot know, so unless you have somebody trustful to advice you, keep away. 

The solvay biwak is solely an emergency shelter. There is an emergency radio available. So if you sleep there without declaring an emergency (even if just to inform the authorities) you have to expect to be fined (the locals are very strict and fines not negligible). In August you cannot expect snow around the hut (though you might get lucky and it can snow at these altitudes even in summer). The first place you are guaranteed to find snow/ice is the shoulder above the Svolvay bivouac. This takes about 3/4h on the way up. As with anything on the Hoernli route: Finding your way and rockfall are the main problems. Even if you have done the way already, if you are exhausted and it is dark, it might a better idea to stay and not have anything to drink for one night. If you are too late you should already know ahead, so you could take snow on your way to the Svolvay bivouac. 

Tell this person to pick up the end that is on the ground and to take you on belay. Even if he doesn't have any gear, instruct him how to use a rock/tree/... for "belaying". Attach yourself to the short end as closely to the munter as possible. Then if you can unload the rope for a short time, do that and untie the munter. If you don't, you need to make a foot sling from the excess rope to do the same. After that you are let down to the ground by your belayer. StrongBad brought up the point of unsuitable rappel wrings that may break from the rope friction: I have never seen a rappel ring like this and can't imagine any metal being abraded to the point of breaking by one slow descent of 3m. However I do hear some scary stories of material in place on the other side of the great pond, so who knows :P 

There exit various kinds of head or even upper body mosquito nets. You can put one over your head and the sleeping bag opening to hold them away. If you are anyway carrying a tent, I think this is optimal as it is very lightweight. As you seem to enjoy sleeping in the open, an alternative would be to ditch your tent entirely and go for a bivy bag, with possible additional bug protection as shown in Liam's answer. 

In both cases the screw placement will be severely weakend and you need to replace it. How far away you try again depends entirely on the situation. Try the closest place that is in some way distinct from the orginal one. If the above is fine the screw is most likely fine. Unless you placed your screw on top of a bulge, which is anyway a bad idea, small cracks at the entrance point are no big issue. I only ever saw such in really deep temperatures (below -5degC). Of course if you have multiple or very long cracks, thats not good. However that should not happen as drilling an ice screw does not displace lots of ice, it cuts, so there is no reason for cracks to form. This is much more likely when hitting your axes into the ice, so you will notice it there first. It can happen in cold temperatures after a big temperature rise or fall that the ice is both very hard and has tension on it. In this case you should not be climbing at all. 

The loosening of the binding is kind of optional, I never do it but my board is second hand, so I do not care too much. The waxing on the other hand is absolutely essential for the base and it is fast and easy to do at home, the necessary materials are not expensive either. The same (except loosing of binding screws) applies to skis as well. 

K. Winkler, H. P. Brehm, J. Haltmeier, *Bergsport Sommer. Technik, Taktik, Sicherheit (SAC-Verlag, 2. Auflage, 2008), p. 228. Equalising anchor The simple answer is again: This is a no-go. Always use a fixed central point or at least stopper knots. There may be a lot of friction in your particular setup, maybe even enough when fully loaded. Still this is a bad idea, as it removes the redundancy. If one of your two points breaks (unlikely but possible), then there will be a static fall into the second (in your case braked by friction, but still). Especially now as you also have webbing over a thin edge, this would be too much risk factors for my liking. If it is a anchor you walk to on top then you will probably never attach to it directly so there is always the rope between the climber/belayer and the relay which is an elastic element. So there wont be a static fall. Still you will have an unnecessarily bigger force. A fixed central point does not have this fallacy and the potentially unequal load is really not an issue. One bolt is strong enough, the second one is just redundancy for the very seldom special case (badly placed anchor, ...).
