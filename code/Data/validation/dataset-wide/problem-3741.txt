Disclaimer. I am just talking about the chiral part of a conformal field theory. The chiral parts of WZW model are described by affine Kac-Moody algebras. I am describing how to obtain the Kac-Moody algebras starting with abelian currents (derivative of a free bosons). $n$ free Abelian currents $\{J_1,\ldots, J_n\}$ correspond to target space $\mathbb R^n$ and compactifying the target space by a lattice $\Lambda\subset \mathbb R^n$ corresponds to add a vertex operator $V_\alpha$ for every point $\alpha\in \Lambda$ of a lattice (or just for a basis). By compactifying the target space $\mathbb R^n$ with a root lattice in the case of a of a simply laced Lie algebra (all roots have the same length $\langle\alpha,\alpha\rangle=2$) one obtains the affine Lie algebra of this corresponding Lie algebra at level 1. Namely the $J_n$ and the $V_{\alpha,n}$ with $\alpha\in\Lambda$ and $\langle\alpha,\alpha\rangle=2$ form a basis of the affine Kac-Moody algebra at level 1. The simple simply laced Lie algebras are exactly the one with A,D,E Dynkin diagram. That is basically the Frenkel-Kac construction: I. B. Frenkel and V. G. Kac. Basic representations of affine Lie algebras and dual resonance models. Invent. Math., 62(1):23–66, 1980. Some other one can get by conformal inclusions, for example $G_2$ at level 3 embeds into $E_6$ at level 1. I guess one obtains all level 1 cases by regarding conformal inclusions $(C_n)_1\times SU(2)_m\subset D_{2m}$ and $G_2\times F_4\subset E_8$. Finally level $\ell$ one can embed in the $n$-fold tensor product of level 1 by $$J_a^{(\ell)}(z) \sim \sum_k 1 \otimes \cdots \otimes \underbrace{J^{(1)}_a(z)}_{k\text{-th position}}\otimes \cdots\otimes 1$$ 

Ostrik's paper shows that every indecomposable module category comes from a connected algebra $A$ given by the internal action endomorphisms. If $A$ can be chosen to be commutative in the center $Z(\mathcal C$), then the module category has the structure of a monoidal category, see e.g. here $URL$ and references therein. If $\mathcal C$ is braided it is enough to ask to ask $A$ to be commutative in $\mathcal C$. There are actually two possible ways to do this. 

If G is finite, do you need to take the GIT quotient? Maybe just the usual categorical would work. A necessary condition is that for any point x of P(V) its stabilizer acts trivially on the fiber of your line bundle at x. The stabilizer would also be finite, and its action on the one-dimensional fiber factors through the quotient by the commutator subgroup. Since the values of the one dimensional representation homomorphism must be roots of unity, after taking appropriate tensor power the action will become trivial. Say, if you consider O(n) where n is the order of G. 

Unless you know that $F'$ has a finite locally free resolution, and this will tend to fail when $F'$ is the skyscraper sheaf of a singular point. But maybe you just want to work with $G$-equivariant coherent sheaves on $X$. 

(Trying to rephrase an earlier question) In topology, a continuous map $f: X \to Y$ has a ``homotopy cofiber" $Cf$ included in a cofiber sequence $$ X \to Y \to Cf \to \Sigma X \to \Sigma Y \to \Sigma CF \to \ldots $$ when $f$ is a cofibration, the cofiber is homotopy equivalent to $X/Y$. Now, if $Y$ is a category, say, of modules over a ring $R$, and $f$ a functor from another category (e.g. embedding of projective modules into all modules), is there a similar cofiber category and a cofiber sequence? 

Some comments (1) On this site there was a question "Why a smooth surjective morphism of schemes admits a section etale-locally?"; so smoothness gives some kind of nice property here. (2) Even for smooth morphisms, over complex numbers one may not have a Zariski local section (even in the case when the fiber is a projective space). (3) For an arbitrary morphism there is no hope for a global section - consider the case of a blowup of a point on a projective space. 

I have a question about weak factorization of birational maps (in characteristic zero). If $X_1 \to X_2$ is a birational map of smooth varieties, it was proved some time ago that we can decompose it into a sequence of blowups and blowdowns with smooth centers. Now, suppose that $X_1, X_2$ are resolutions of the same $Y$, so they admit a birational morphism to $Y$. Can we find a factorization into blowups and blowdowns so that on each intermediate step we also have a morphism to $Y$? Is this written up somewhere? 

I have find in [equation 1.1.51, page 24,Chaichian M, Demichev A. Path integrals in physics, vol I : stochastic processes and quantum mechanics. Bristol (Philadelphia): Institute of Physics Publishing; 2001] that when $N$ goes to $\infty$, then $$ \lim_{\Delta t \to 0,\\ N \to \infty} \exp \left ( -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{(x_i-x_{i-1})^2}{t_i-t_{i-1}}\right ) \prod_{i=1}^N \frac{d x_i}{\sqrt{2 \pi (t_i -t_{i-1})}} =\\ ``\exp \left ( -\frac{1}{2} \int_0^t |\dot{x}(s)|^2 d s \right ) \prod_{\tau=0}^t \frac{d x(\tau)}{\sqrt{2 \pi d \tau}}" $$ thus, if $A_y$ is a non-empty open set containing $y$, $$ \mathbb{P} (x(T) \in A_y | x(t) = x) = \int_{A_y} p(x,t;y,T) d y\\ = "\int_{C(x,t;A_y,T)} \int_{E^\infty}\exp \left ( -\frac{1}{2} \int_0^t |\dot{x}(s)|^2 d s \right ) \prod_{\tau=0}^t \frac{d x(\tau)}{\sqrt{2 \pi d \tau}}" $$ Here we don't really know what's inside the integral but, if no mistake, what should be correct is to write $$ \mathbb{P} (x(T) \in A_y | x(t) = x) = \mu (C(x,t;A_y,T)). $$ 

Let $W(t)$ be a standard brownian motion in $E \triangleq \mathbb{R}^d$. The transition probability from a state $x \in E$ at time $t$ to a state $y \in E$ at time $T$ is $$ p(x,t;y,T) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi (T-t)}^d} \exp \left ( -\frac{1}{2} \frac{\|x-y \|^2}{T-t}\right ). $$ Using the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation, it is clear that for all $n \geq 0$ and for all finite sequence of states $x_0 = x, x_1, ... , x_n, x_{n+1} = y$ and $t_0 = t < t_1 < ... < t_n < t_{n+1} = T$, we have $$ p(x,t;y,T) = \int_{E^n} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}^{nd}} \exp \left ( -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=0}^{n} \frac{\|x_{i+1}-x_i \|^2}{t_{i+1}-t_i}\right ) \prod_{i=1}^n \frac{d x_i}{\sqrt{t_{i+1}-t_i}^d}. $$ I am not so sure that the limit as $n \to \infty$ makes sense in the right hand side above but I believe that it can be interpreted in terms of the Wiener measure on $\mathcal{C}([0,\infty);E)$ and $$ C(x,t;y,T) \triangleq \{ \omega \in \mathcal{C}([0,\infty);E) \: | \: w(t) = x, \: w(T) = y \}. $$ (if no mistake) how to interpret $p(x,t;y,T)$ in terms of $\mu$ and $C(x,t;y,T))$? 

It's probably a very simple question but I am not sure about the reference. In the definition of a balanced monoidal category we require that the braiding isomorphims $$c_{V, W}: V \otimes W \to W \otimes V$$ are not arbitrary but admit twisting isomorphisms $\theta_V: V \to V$ which, in a way, represent $c_{V, W} c_{W, V}$ as a coboundary. Does it mean that from the homotopy point of view, existence of a twisting makes the category symmetric monoidal in the sense of $\infty$-categories? 

I have a smooth projective morphism $X \to S$ or relative dimension 1 (i.e. a family of smooth curves over base $S$). There should be a map $H^2(X, K_2) \to H^1(S, K_1) = Pic(S)$ given by integration along the fibers (the cohomology is in the Zariski topology and $K_i$ are the Zariski sheaves of algebraic $K$-theories). In other words, some kind of global version of the symbol map in $K$-theory. Is this written up somewhere? The only thing I have seen is a paper by Brylinsky and someone else, where they take two rational functions $f$ and $g$ and cook up a number, froom values of $f$ at zeros and poles of $g$, and values of $g$ at zeros and poles of $f$. 

I am reading two papers by Daniel Grayson: "Localization for flat modules in algebraic K-theory" and "Algebraic cycles and algebraic K-theory" and I am wondering if any recent advances in K-theory can extend the results a bit. Specifically, suppose $\pi: X \to S$ is a smooth projective morphism of relative dimension 2. Mimicking Corollary 1.6 in the second paper, can we write an exact complex of sheaves $$ 0 \to \mathcal{K}_3 (X) \to \mathcal{K}_3^{0/1}(X/S) \to \mathcal{K}_2^{1/2}(X/S) \to \mathcal{K}_1^2(X/S) \to 0? $$ The sheaves involved are sheafification of K-theory in Zariski or etale topology. The last term is K-theory of coherent sheaves flat over $S$ with support of relative codimension 2 (i.e. support finite over $S$). The two intermediate terms are some kind of relative K-theory for the pairs built from coherent sheaves (flat over $S$) with support of relative codimension 0 (resp. 1) and its subcategory of sheaves with support of relative codimension 1 (resp. 2). In fact, I am OK with a resolution of this nature where the two middle terms can be a bit more obscure than stated, as long as the first and the last terms remain the same. An alternative: when $Y \to S$ is a flat family of projective curves, but not necessarily smooth, is there an analogue of the resolution $$ 0 \to \mathcal{K}_2(Y) \to \mathcal{K}_2^{0/1}(Y/S) \to \mathcal{K}_1^1(Y/S) \to 0 $$ stated in Corollary 1.6 for the case when $Y$ is relatively smooth over $S$? Again, it's OK if the middle term gets a bit more obscure, as long as the other two survive (maybe with the correction that the first term is K-theory of coherent sheaves, not of projective modules). 

As a prototype example of ergodic diffusion, consider a real valued Ornstein Uhlenbeck process of the form $$ d X_t = -\alpha X_t d t + \sigma d W_t, \quad X_0 = x $$ where $\alpha, \sigma > 0$ are constant and $W$ is a real valued Wiener process. I am trying to get some help to clarify the connection between the relaxation time $\tau$ related to the convergence to the invariant probability measure and the first eigenvalue of the generator $$ - A = \frac{\sigma^2}{2} \partial_{xx} - \alpha x \partial_x $$ We consider the minus sign to have a positive spectrum. I have not been able identify a proper reference but this connection is known for a class of ergodic processes. Let me do some calculations to see what's going on. First, on one hand, a quick check tells us that $X_t$ has a gaussian density that is : $$ p_{t,x}(y) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi} \Sigma_t} \exp \left ( - \frac{1}{2} \left (\frac{y-m_t(x)}{\Sigma_t} \right )^2 \right ) $$ where $$ m_t(x) = \exp(-\alpha t) x \quad \mbox{and} \quad \Sigma_t^2 = \frac{\sigma^2}{2\alpha} (1-\exp(-2 \alpha t )) $$ and therefore $$ \lim_{t \to \infty} p_{t,x}(y) = \frac{1}{\sigma} \sqrt{\frac{\alpha}{\pi}} \exp \left ( - \alpha \left (\frac{y}{\sigma} \right )^2 \right ). $$ Next using the function $$ \sqrt{2 \pi} F(\xi,\eta) \triangleq \frac{1}{\xi} \exp \left ( -\frac{1}{2} \left ( \frac{\eta}{\xi} \right )^2 \right ) $$ and when $t$ is large we have $$ p_{t,x}(y) - p(y) \approx F_\xi \left ( \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{2 \alpha}}, y \right ) \left ( \Sigma_t - \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{2\alpha}} \right ) + F_\eta \left ( \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{2 \alpha}}, y \right ) m_t(x) $$ which yields $$ \lim_{t \to \infty} - \frac{1}{t} \log( |p_{t,x}(y) - p(y)| ) = \frac{1}{\alpha}. $$ Comment : I am somehow surprised that $\sigma$ does not affect this relaxation time. As explained in $URL$ the simplest theoretical description of relaxation as function of time t is an exponential law $\exp \left (-\frac{t}{\tau} \right )$. On the other hand, taking $w(x) = x$, we clearly see that $$ A w = \alpha w, $$ in other words, $\alpha$ is an eigenvalue (the first one, we call it $\lambda_1$) for $A$ and it is related to the eigenvector $w$. We finally observe that the first eigenvalue of $A$ is the inverse of the time of relaxation for $p_{x,t}$, concisely $$ \fbox{$\lambda_1 \tau = 1$}. $$ question : What is the deep reason for such a connection between $\tau$ and $\lambda_1$? 

Lurie proves that formal $E_\infty$ moduli problems over a field $k$ are equivalent to augmented $E_\infty$-algebras. Is there a reasonably small model for this when $k = \mathbb{F}_p$? Or maybe we could have a similar, but different, statement where we start with moduli problems over [commutative algebras with additional Steenrod operations], and on the output we get a suitably modified category of dg Lie algebras? 

You may want to look at curves in three dimensional projective space. I vaguely remember, although I may be wrong, that there was a component with general member non-reduced. 

Is there a transparent explanation of why the singular cochain complex of a topological space X is an $E_\infty$ algebra. There are combinatorial proofs using, say, the surjection operad, but is there a topological picture behind those? If we wanted to restrict,say, to the level of little (2-)discs, could we describe the structure using something like Eilenberg-Zilber contractions of $C^*(X^m)$ onto $C^*(X)^{\otimes m}$, various diagonal maps and so on? 

The closest I have seen to what you are asking, is the paper Hübl, Reinhold; Yekutieli, Amnon Adelic Chern forms and applications. Amer. J. Math. 121 (1999), no. 4, 797–839. Not quite Riemann-Roch, but probably the right approach. 

Let $E$ be a rank $r$ bundle on a quasiprojective scheme. There is a natural map $$ \Lambda^r H^0(E) \to H^0(\Lambda^r E) $$ It does not have to be surjective as can be seen from the case when $E$ is a direct sum of line bundles. However, is it true that $E$ can always be twisted by an ample line bundle so that this map becomes surjective? 

It is known that a flasque sheaf on a topological space has trivial cohomology. Suppose that we are in a relative situation of a smooth fibration $\pi: X \to S$ and $F$ is a sheaf on $X$. Is there are weaker condition on $F$ which implies that the higher direct images to $S$ are trivial (but not necessarily the cohomology groups of $F$ on $X$).
