Take a look at Consequentialism, or more specifically at Utilitarianism. One branch of Consequentialism is act Consequentialism (Utilitarianism simply being hedonistic act Consequentialism), which is briefly summarized as follows by SEP. "Act consequentialism is the claim that an act is morally right if and only if that act maximizes the good, that is, if and only if the total amount of good for all minus the total amount of bad for all is greater than this net amount for any incompatible act available to the agent on that occasion." ($URL$ Basically consequentialism attempts to maximize utility, in other words general well-being, of all people. I think this is more or less what you're looking for. 

Honesty is simply speaking/writing (or whatever mode of communication) in a way that accurately conveys your beliefs, not necessarily the truth. Again it can be true, as in my first example, but truth is by no means a necessary condition for honesty. "Truth telling", of course also has no necessary connection with honesty. For example, imagine you are asking me for help with basic trigonometry. Unfortunately, unbeknownst to you I despise you, so I decide to give you the wrong answer. So I tell you this: "The tangent of an angle is equal to the length of the opposite side divided by the length of the adjacent side." Fortunately for you I'm really not that good at math, so I actually believed that the sine of an angle had that formula instead of tangent, and I was actually trying to deceive you so that you would do worse on your next math test. In that situation I told the truth, as I'm sure you know (after all tan(theta)=opposite/adjacent is indeed the correct formula). But at the same time I was not honest. I attempted to lie to you, since I believed that the formula I gave you was wrong(even though in actuality it is correct). "Truth telling" is simply whether or not you tell someone what is objectively true. And of course telling the truth and honesty can go together as well. For example if you asked me "Have you ever broken a bone?" I could say "Nope, I've never broken a bone." I believe that it's true, so I am indeed being honest, and it also happens that it actually is true(I have never broken a bone), so I'm also telling you the truth. So to address your last question, I'll give a couple well known philosophical perspectives. Kant would say(well there are many different interpretations, but I believe this is the most well known and accepted as being what Kant intended) that lying is always wrong. This comes from his Categorical Imperative which has multiple forms, although Kant claims they are all equivalent ($URL$ so I will pick the Universal Law. "act only in accordance with that maxim through which you can at the same time will that it become a universal law" (SEP, link from like 2 lines up). That SEP entry gives an example in which, if you decided to lie to steal money, according to Kant for that to be moral you would have to wish that every single person would also make the decision to lie to steal money. But if everyone did that, then society would break down because no one would be able to trust each other. I believe he is completely literal when saying that lying is never ok, no matter what. (Sorry can't find a source, but I've read it quite a few times.) I disagree, so here is a consequentialist/utilitarian argument and example. To way way oversimplify, consequentialism/utilitarianism focus on the overall welfare (or utility) of either society as a whole, or just locally who is affected by whatever decision you're making. Both my grandparents have been very sick. About two weeks ago, my grandpa died, and my grandma is completely bedridden(literally has a hospital bed in her room), and her memory is completely gone. She forgets everything within a few seconds, or a minute or two at most. She usually asks me what college I'm attending about 30 times a conversation. (I'm just emphasizing how truly non existent her memory capacity is because it's important). The first time I talked to her after my grandpa's funeral, she asked me where he was probably about 15 times. I told her each time that he was dead. She was going through the immense, horrible pain of learning that her husband died for the first time every single time I told her. It was obvious it hurt so so badly, it was truly the first time she had heard it (in her mind) every single time. I eventually realized that she's completely bedridden, not even in charge of her own property anymore, the funeral and everything was taken care of by her family members since she isn't really able to do things anymore, and simply has no important (or even trivial) decisions she can make. In other words, there was literally absolutely no good that could come from telling her the truth because there will never be a decision she makes where she needs to know, and because she can't even go to therapy and come to terms with what happened, because her memory would never let her remember. If everyone in my family told her the truth, she would be subjected to finding out for the very first time that her husband had died, over and over and over again, every 5-10 minutes for the rest of her life(except when she's sleeping). To me, wishing that on anyone is unacceptable, and any ethical system that would allow that must be flawed. My approach about the situation in the above paragraph was a utilitarian approach. I simply chose the option that (as best as I could tell) would maximise pleasure (or utility/happiness, whatever term you want), or at least minimize suffering, and that option just happened to be to lie. I should point out that there is a definition of lying that actually would exclude the knowing, intentionally deceptive untruths I said to my grandma to not be considered lying. The following definition of lying, and brief follow up is from my first link to SEP in the first paragraph. 

I understand compatibilism to mean that an action can be free if it is self-determined by the agent, even if it would have been impossible for the agent to choose any other action. Consider the following analogy. Person A is a slave who has had some sort of brain control device implanted. This brain control device does the following and nothing else. It makes the person it's controlling desire to continue providing free labor under horrible conditions(being a slave) more strongly than they desire to leave and do anything else. There are also no laws prohibiting person A from leaving, and it has been made completely clear to person A that there will be no punishment for them trying to leave. In fact their owner has told A that they will give A some starting money to help them out if they leave. Is person A free? It seems like a compatibilist must say yes, because their continued decision to remain a slave is their own decision, it is not from fear of consequences or anything like that. They are choosing to stay because it is truly what they want to do, and to a compatibilist the fact that they couldn't "want otherwise" is irrelevant. But I think most people would have a problem calling someone in this situation free. It just seems to me like compatibilism is a word game created just to give us "free will", but in doing so it completely devalues its own concept of free will. Also feel free to suggest any additional tags or for me to remove a tag. I included linguistics because I think this is mainly an issue of how free will is defined, but I could totally understand if many people thing that it's an irrelevant tag. EDIT: So I just had an idea for a rebuttal defending compatibilism, so the rest of this paragraph is like me putting on my compatibilist hat for a minute. In order for the slave to choose otherwise, they would have to be free to act against their own will. But would acting against your own will really be a freely chosen action? For that action to be chosen by the agent (and therefore freely willed), the action HAS to be what the agent wills to do. Surely if you want to have a hamburger for dinner, but your parents make you eat spinach, you haven't freely chosen spinach for dinner. So would the above paragraph be a valid defense of compatibilism? Essentially that not accepting the slaves choice to continue being a slave as free is the same as demanding a logical impossibility to define an action as free? 

To me this seems more like an attempt to assign inherent wrongness to lying than to produce a coherent definition though. Additionally, this definition seems to be very confused about free will, conflating a true lack of free will with simply acting a certain way out of fear. A person being robbed at gunpoint (temporarily just assuming free will exists for sake of argument) has no less free will than any other person has ever had. They would still be free to choose defying the assailant, it would just be a hard choice to make since they know that they are essentially choosing death. Nevertheless, the decision that person makes is free in terms of actual free will, just as much as someone choosing to get ice cream or cake. So I don't think that is a great definition. I'll just conclude with a (albeit rare) piece of still applicable wisdom about Kant that I think answers you most directly. 

Universal Skepticism seems to boldly claim certainty in the knowledge that knowledge is impossible. The obvious contradiction here is that if they really believe their own theory, it should force them to conclude that there is no way to know that the theory is true, because the very nature of their theory says that knowledge is impossible. This should then open the door to other arguments, since now a universal skeptic is forced to conclude that they have no way of knowing if knowledge is impossible, so they have no reason to put their somewhat arbitrary skeptical beliefs above any others. They should believe what has the the best justification, even if certainty can't be guaranteed, as opposed to only believing that they know nothing. Would't this really just mean that they are no longer universal skeptics? 

It's a perfect solution fallacy, which I believe is a more specific type of the nirvana fallacy, the name (perfect solution, not nirvana) implies. It means refusing to accept a solution because it's not perfect, or because some hypothetical better solution might exist. The situation you gave is definitely an example of that fallacy, but keep in mind there are certainly many situations where this sort of reasoning(just less extreme) is perfectly valid. For example, if you're at the airport a few minutes before your flight boards, and want a soda(you're not terribly thirsty, you just feel like having a soda), it wouldn't necessarily be a fallacy to reject the solution of buying a soda before you get on your plane because you want a free soda. Even though in most situations that might be the perfect solution fallacy because demanding free things is usually unrealistic, you know that you can get a free soda on the plane in half an hour. On the other hand, if you wouldn't even take the free soda on the plane because the only solution you will accept is a free soda exactly right when you want it, then that would again be a perfect solution fallacy. So yea, the situation you described is a perfect solution fallacy. Just keep in mind that for something to be a perfect solution fallacy, the person has to either be expecting a perfect solution, or rejecting a solution better than the current situation because it might leave some problems unsolved. 

Yes, an argument can be true even if the premise(s) is false. Validity is only about the structure of the argument, the form, which is why it's called formal logic. Having a false premise is irrelevant to the formal validity, and is instead an informal error. As Mauro pointed out in his comment on your question, all conclusions can be shown to follow from a contradiction, so the example you gave is indeed a valid argument, although I don't think the example you gave is really that relevant to your real question. A more relevant example to your actual question would be an argument like this. "All bachelors are married. John is a bachelor. Therefore John is married." So just assume that john actually is a bachelor for this example. This is a completely valid argument, at least in terms of formal logic. Note, however, that even though it is a valid argument, it gives a false conclusion because it has a false premise (that all bachelors are married), and that premise will always be false. Note also that it COULD give a true conclusion, if we had also made the other premise (that john is a bachelor) false, meaning that john really isn't a bachelor. Then the same argument would give the same conclusion, that john is married, but now the conclusion would be true, because the premise that john is a bachelor is false. Basically it's just that validity determines whether that form of argument works and is completely consistent. If you take a false premise, then your knowledge about whether you'll get a true conclusion goes out the window (depending on how many premises are false and how many are true, etc). 

I will include a few quotes from this SEP entry, but this would be a great SEP entry for you to read through as it pertains pretty directly to your question. I just read the whole thing just for this answer haha, and it was very interesting. $URL$ So regarding honesty vs "truth telling". They are at least in a certain sense unrelated. Honesty is the attempt to tell the truth, it is telling what you believe to be true. For example, I could tell you "2+2=4", and I would be being honest. Not because it's true, but because I believe that it's true. This is an example where I was both honest and told the truth. To illustrate that here's a different example. Let's say hypothetically that I believe the earth is flat. Then I could tell you "The earth is flat", and that would also be honest even though it's not true. It's honest because I told you what I believed to be true. 

Lying is usually wrong, because it is treating people as a means, rather than an end in themselves. It is disrespecting their autonomy, and you are robbing them of the ability to make as informed of a decision as they could have if you told the truth. I think this is a great point, and I totally agree with it, I just think he takes it too far saying that you can never lie. That's why I like the consequentialist perspective better. If people followed consequentialism, it would still lead people to not lie the vast majority of the time, but it will also tell people that they should lie when for example it might save a life, or save someone from enormous suffering.
