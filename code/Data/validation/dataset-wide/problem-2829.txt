A more general meaning of instrumentalism has been advocated by John Dewey. Instrumentalism focus rightly on one characteristics of natural sciences: To make predictions or retrodictions. But instrumentalism neglects a second characteristics: Science is based on the theoretical concept of theories. And theories claim to explain observations, they do not only predict them. 

The most effective way to learn critical thinking is to apply the method of questioning in all situations of daily life. It is bit acting like Socrates as Plato portraits him in his early dialogues, e.g., Euthyphro, Laches, Ion. 

Since the advent of quantum mechanics we know that observation of microphysical effects may disturb the mind-independent reality in an unpredicitible way. As a consequence our knowledge resulting from a single observation is restriced by Heisenberg uncertainty relations. But according to Kant’s emphasis on the thing-in-itself we can never know how the mind independent world is. Because we construct our knowledge from the input of our senses, due to the forms of our intution, and using the categories of our reasoning. The whole process acts as a filter. You do not give your definition of ontological relativism. But one can denote Kant’s position as ontological relativism. On the opposite, ontological relativism in the sense of Quine would be irrelevant for your question. 3) I would even say that anti-relativism collapses into solipsism. One cannot refute the latter position by logical argumentation. But no solipsist endures this position in his daily life. 

Nietzsche develops his thoughts on European art in his essay from 1872 The Birth of Tragedy from the Spirit of Music. Already in the first sentence he introduces his thesis that any development of art is bound to the pair Apollonian and Dionysian. He introduces both terms as a pair of opposed drives. As a first approximation he relates them to the two human states of dream and frenzy (German: Rausch). For me it is rather difficult to follow Nietzsche's text and to make any sense from the big words in his general statements. The author asserts far reaching claims, makes comparisons, but he does not give arguments. He alludes to his precursors in philosophy of art, in particular to Friedrich Schiller. The terms Apollonian and Dionysian had been introduced before by the German philosopher Friedrich Schelling in an essay from 1795/96 Über das Studium der Griechischen Poesie. The essay is one of the earliest works of Nietzsche. It results from his time as professor of classical philology and from his adoration of Richard Wagner, who at this time was his mentor in arts. It is well known that the essay was also his swan song in this discipline. After publication his reputation as classical philologists was ruined and Nietzsche started his career as philosoph. Later Nietzsche added a second preface entitled Attempt of self-criticis (German: Versuch einer Selbstkritik) where he pulls the book to pieces. 

Of course there are accounts of human nature which are not based on metaphysical concepts. You may take any contemporary textbook on psychology, e.g., 

I do not know about any philosopher who claims that moral discussion is impossible. Probably one can ascribe such a claim to a solipzist, who can have a moral discussion only with himself. The fact that there are many moral discussions in this blog, i.e. discussions about moral decisions as well as discussions about moral and ethics itself, show that such discussions are possible. But it is considered controversial, whether it is possible to recognize values to guide moral decisions or to give an ultimate justification for such values. 

@Robbo The passage from Alan Watts expresses a view which is often heard when opposing so called Eastern and Western thinking. Then Western culture is characterized by science, technological progess and target orientation. While Eastern culture is characterized by meditation and experiences which cannot be expressed by words - as Western people are told. Of course, both characterizations are much too simple and hold at best as a first approximation. I understand thought in the quoted passage as “rationality”, characterized by logcial thinking with argumentation. According to Watts, “above” is the Eastern culture, “below” is Western activism. Both terms above and below are taken as evaluation as you assume. Aside: In my opinion Watts re-echos a cliché. 

It is one of the severest traps of language to reify the negation. Because reification prompts the question whether a new object has been created, e.g., which object is nothing = no-thing? Sometimes the error continues when asking for properties or possible actions of the new object. The best-known example is Heidegger's nothingness. Aside: I know than fans of Heidegger do not share my assessment:-) To defuse the problem one can always keep the negation as negation. In the example above nothing can literally be said then transformes into it is not possible to say a single word. 

Descartes was educated in a college run by Jesuit priests. Here he received an in-depth training in scholastic philosophy. The new founded order of Jesuits united the main proponents of scholastic philosophy. The subject was teached in an authoritative form, relying heavily on Thomas Aquinas and on the works of Aristotle. It was used as a safeguard to support and to defend the doctrines of the Catholic church. We know about internal instructions to the philosophical teachers of this order. They should avoid introducing new thoughts and even new philosophical methods. Descartes undertook his work primarily not in direct response to the scholastic doctrine, but in response to scholastic method. He was unhappy with the uncertainty of the disputed speculations. He was driven by the search for certain knowledge. And he was fascinated by the reliability of the mathematical method to obtain certain knowledge. It is a methodological problem that Descartes addresses. Referring to the doctrine there was one main issue and some minor ones, which Descrates considered different from the Jesuits' official teachings. First, Descartes represents the heliocentric model that the earth moves around the sun. Secondly, some examples for minor issues: Descrates rejectes the Aristotelian causa finalis as useless for natural science (Med. IV, section 6). He also rejects the Aristotelian teachings of four fundamental elements. Instead, Descrates operates with the concept of matter and its fundamental property of extension. 

Hence Ockham did not speak about hypotheses as a means for explanation in general. Therefore the objections from your question do not meet Ockham’s razor. Instead Ockham focused on the field of ontology, dealing with entities in the ontological sense. 2) Methodological: How to apply Ockham‘s principle as a useful heuristics? I consider the elimination of the aether concept from electrodynamics by Einstein a useful application of Ockham’s razor. Physics of the 19. century postulated a substrate for the expansion of light which was called aether. It was necessary to ascribe rather unusual properties to this hypothetical substance. In addition all attempts to observe a physical effect of aether failed. Both difficulties encouraged Einstein to abandon a concept which did not explain anything. This insight can be generalized: It is useful to apply Ockham’s razor to a concept which does not explain anything but creates additional questions. Aside: As science progressed a new aether concept entered physics in the form of an ubiquitous Higg’s field. Since the experimental evidence for the simplest Higg’s boson one can continue with employing the Higg’s field to explain mass generation, see „The Return of the Aether“ in Greene, Brian: The Fabric of the Cosmos. p. 268f. Concerning your bonus question I follow Mauro's quote from SEP: For Ockham, the only truly necessary entity is God; everything else, the whole of creation, is radically contingent through and through. 

Formally an assumption is the premiss "A" of an implication "A => B". Here "A" and "B" themselves may be formulas of arbitrary complexity. On knows, that the implication is true if and only if either A is false or A and B both are true. In the applications, the formula "B" is given and one looks for a formula "A", which is true and such that the implication "A => B is true". Then one knows that "B" is true. The first task is to find such formula A, i.e. to find the hidden premiss. 

Knowledge representation is a model of a certain domain of the real world. These models are composed from objecttypes (entity, surrogate) and the relations between objecttypes. Such models are named "ontologies" and can be formalized as "Entity-relationship-models". Ontologies are used e.g., in business-administration to model a certain business domain. In sales we have entities like customer, order, product and relationsships between the entities customer and order like customer places an order, and between order and product like an order comprises several products. These ontologies are the prerequisites for database design. 

I do not remember that Newton solved any problem from philosophy. Instead, Newton developed groundbreaking thoughts about gravitation. He gave mechanics a solid base by developing calculus. He was one of the first to establish the domain of mathematical physics. Concerning the problem of time and space Newton asserted the existence of absolute space and absolute time. But that claim did not solve any philosophical problem, because it was simply wrong. Newton's seminal work is entitled "Philosophiae naturalis Principa Mathematica". Possibly the term "philosophiae naturalis" induced the lecturer, to whom you refer, to his statement that Newton was successful as a philosopher. I consider Newton no more and no less a successful philosopher than his precursor Galilei and his follower Einstein. All three were physicists. Of course they knew the thoughts of their precursors or fellow philosophers like Aristotle, Leibniz, or Mach. Aside. Can you find out how the lecturer motivates his judgement? 

The main difference is that Kant rejects the possibility to recognize "the real being" of the world. See Kant's conception of the therm "world" as a limit concept and Kant's rejection of the recognizability of things-in-themselves. Husserl does not emphasize these fundamental differences. Instead he regards Kant on the right way to his own, Husserl's, concept of transcendental philosophy. 

Truth or falsehood of a belief is a relation between the belief, expressed as a proposition, and a fact from the physical world. To keep things simple I do not consider facts from the mental world. The same holds true for those mental states which incorporate representation of facts. Either the model is a correct representation or it is a wrong representation. The model itself is a pattern of neural activities. I even favor the view that the neurobiological substrate of beliefs are exactly such representational states. 

1) Taken your question literally: One does not need to argue that consciousness exists. Everybody when awake is conscious and experiences consciousness. One can discuss whether every perception is a conscious perception. Because we know that humans can also be triggered by unconscious stimuli. This kind of stimulation is used by marketing mechanisms or by priming, applied in an experimental context of cognitive psychology. 2) Hence the question is not, whether consciousness exists. The questions are: 

Thr hard problem of consiousness asks how to embedd my subjectivity (first person’s view) into a scientific model (third person’s view). The problem of other minds asks how to detect other human’s subjectivity from the third person’s viewpoint. Both problems deal with the relation between first person’s viewpoint and third person’s viewpoint, i.e. between the subjective and the objective stance. But the problems are not identical. 

Broadly speaking, consequentialism judges an action according to the consequences of the action. While a deontological judgement asks whether the action follows a given rule. 1) A main proponent of a deontological rule is Immanuel Kant. His fundamental rule is the categorical imperative. It states: Act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law. 2) A main proponent of a consequentialist ethics is Jeremy Bentham. His prinicple of utilitarian ethics states: By the principle of utility is meant that principle which approves or disapproves of every action whatsoever according to the tendency it appears to have to augment or diminish the happiness of the party whose interest is in question: or, what is the same thing in other words to promote or to oppose that happiness.
