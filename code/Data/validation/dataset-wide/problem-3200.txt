(It is somewhat ironic that Thomas Aquinas was one of the early distinguished graduates of the University of Naples, given the ideological tension between the clergy and that Emperor.) 

See Game Theory for more on that problem of the zero sum game, which in this case is simplified as "If they aren't on our side, they are on the opposing side!" East/West were also commonly referred to as the Communist world and the Free World, and there was an unaligned bloc (for example, India)) that eventually got called the Third World as a form of political shorthand. No few nations in the Unaligned bloc took the position that 'we don't want to be forced into being on one side or another.' (Can you blame them?) 

The cold war was "a war by other means" between two global power blocs Your question is based on a false premise, that false premise being that the US and the USSR actually wanted to go to war with each other. In the large sense, they didn't, for a variety of reasons but two primary ones were (1) how expensive in blood and treasure World War II had been, and (2) the consequences of actually using the nuclear weapons that both sides had. Wars are usually a child of politics 

Issue: Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), which extends 200 nautical miles from the country's coastline. What's at stake in the SCS and its resource zones is money, and future energy revenue. From a survey in the mid 90's ... 

Hitler and his party appealed to (among other things) nationalism in their efforts to take Germany in their political direction. FWIW, Wagner's legacy has in the last half of a century certainly come under fire, in part due to an association with nationalism and anti Semitism, which is also associated with Hitler and the Third Reich. Your question suggests that one should consider the social context when that novel was published. I read The Odessa File shortly after it came out. (Early 1970's.) At that time, the hunt of for some of the Nazis who had escaped to Argentina, Brazil, and elsewhere was alive in the Western context. It was also in the news now and again as various SS or other sorts were found. This was an era when WW II movies were still very popular (The Longest Day, Raid on Rommel, the Dirty Dozen, the Boys from Brazil were all contemporary films to the novel's release). The Nazi was a standard trope-villain in both film and literature. (Robert Ludlum featured a few Nazis as the bad guys, or shadow bad guys, in his books, also popular at the time). Given the time of Fortsythe's book's publication, his alluding to that symbolism -- the pre-Christian Germanic Volk and their legends/paganism -- is not a surprise. It was par for the course in that time and place for fictional treatments of the Third Reich. Given the sales of the book, and the movie after, it was part of a successful formula used by Forsythe and others. 

Features of a hand grenade There is a double safety feature on a typical hand grenade that prevents it from blowing up before you have sent it to its target. The modern hand grenade uses a delayed explosion, once it is armed, as a design feature to account for the approximate time of flight of a lobbed grenade. (Most of which are descendants of the Mills Bomb from WW I). Safety feature one. The pin holds the handle in place. Grenade not armed. Safety feature two. The handle held down? Grenade not armed. The handle, once the pin is pulled, can be held in place to keep the fusing from beginning the sequence that leads to detonation. (Typically 3 or 5 seconds, depends on the grenade ... there are a lot of different models) In order to arm the grenade, you pull out the pin, and once you throw it the handle flies off. At this point you have a finite number of seconds before it blows up. (For a rifle grenade, the launch from the rifle is what begins the arming/detonation sequence). A sling launched grenade would, due to how one uses a sling, eat up some of that time to (1) insert the grenade into the sling and then (2) use the longer release arc to get the velocity generated for launch. (Compare a compact throw from second base to first versus a pitcher's full body extension in terms of release time) This increases the likelihood of the grenade exploding before launch (ouch!) or exploding too soon after launch to do damage to the target. (Blow up halfway there). It also adds additional motions/movements that can go wrong. The grenade lob is a comparatively simple, compact motion. A further risk is the grenade slipping out of the sling during the launch process, and placing your own comrades at risk. (Nooooo!) Using a sling needlessly complicates the use of a modern hand grenade. Rifle Grenades Modern technology has arrived at a variety of rifle grenades, which date back in concept to 20th century warfare (WWI and WWII). Those grenades were adapted to be fired from a rifle if extra range was needed. Nowadays, there are whole families of grenade launchers meant to launch longer range grenades, like the M40 grenade(the only one I have experience with), to include the M79 and M203. (Pics at that link, and I have used them both). Final answer (1) Using a sling eats up too much of the time before detonation, so that the grenade most likely won't blow up at the target. (Needless complexity) (2) Safety for the grenadier and his allies. (A mistake could be lethal). (3) If you need the range, use a rifle grenade/grenade launcher (The right tool for the job) Sources: (1) Wiki on hand grenades (where the pictures came from) (2) (Experience) Military training received in how to use a hand grenade and grenade launchers.
