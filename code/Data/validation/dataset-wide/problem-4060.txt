Variation A: I'm happy to work with simplicial combinatorial model categories rather than ordinary ones. Variation B: It would also be interesting to know the answer to the following questions for combinatorial model $\infty$-categories and left $\infty$-Quillen functors. This is probably easier because one has more flexibility in this setting. Question 1: Is $N: \mathbf Q \to Pres^L$ an equivalence of $\infty$-categories? This functor is known to be essentially surjective -- for simplicial model categories this is in HTT, I think. Question 2: Can the homotopical category $Q$ be refined to a model category? There are size issues here; I'm happy with any way of handling them. I might suspect that something like Dugger's universal homotopy theories provide cofibrant resolutions. More specifically, I'd like to know: Question 3: Are there model categories $C, D$ such that every left adjoint functor $NC \to ND$ is modeled by a left Quillen functor? 

As to the more general question you mention at the end: What is the relationship between the geometric realization of a category and the geometric realization of its fundamental gropuoid? I believe that the classifying space of the groupoidification of a category should be the 1-truncation of the classifying space of the category, equivalently the classifying space of the fundamental groupoid of the classifying space of the category. Let me say that again: $|N(\Pi_1C)| = \tau_1|N(C)| = \mathbf{B}\Pi_1|N(C)|$ where 

Let $V$ be a complete and cocomplete symmetric monoidal closed enriching category. It's a general fact (see Street, Absolute colimits in enriched categories) that the Cauchy completion $\tilde C$ of $C$ is the enriched category of right adjoint bimodules from a point to $C$. That is, an object is an enriched presheaf $R: C^{op} \to V$, an enriched copresheaf $L: C \to V$, a unit $\eta: I \to \int^{c \in C} R(c) \otimes L(c)$, and and counit $\varepsilon: L(c) \otimes R(c') \to C(c,c')$ natural in $c,c'$, satisfying triangle identities. So the idea is to start with this data, and, assuming that $C$ has all the absolute colimits you know about, show that this adjoint bimodule is representable, i.e. show that there exists $c_\ast \in C$ such that $R \cong C(-,c_\ast)$, $L \cong (c_\ast,-)$, in such a way that $\varepsilon$ becomes composition and $\eta$ becomes the unit map $I \to C(c_\ast,c_\ast)$. I'm not sure there's anything systematic about how to go about showing this -- it will depend, for example, on the nature of the list of colimits you have to work with -- so maybe it's best just to illustrate with an example. Let's take $V = Ab$. Then, using an explicit description of the coend, we know that $\eta$ must be of the form $\sum_i a_i \otimes b_i$ with $a_i \in R(c_i)$, $b_i \in L(c_i)$ (and the sum is finite). So, assuming we have direct sums, we can just take $\eta$ to live in $R(\oplus_i c_i) \otimes L(\oplus_i c_i)$. Then using $\varepsilon$ we can write down an idempotent on the object $\oplus_i c_i$ which we split to get a representing object for $(R,L,\eta, \varepsilon)$. 

Does some statement along these lines hold? It at least works out in ACF, where $\ker \chi$ consists only of Frobenius automorphisms as soon as the transcendence degree of $A$ is at least 2. EDIT In view of the counterexamples in the comments that I should have noticed, there should be an additional "non degeneracy" hypothesis. Let's additionally stipulate that $\overline{A \cup B} \neq \bar A \cup \bar B$ unless $\bar A \subseteq \bar B$ or $\bar B \subseteq \bar A$. That makes the kind of argument that works in the ACF case look plausible. 

Let's talk about free monoid constructions in a monoidal category $(\mathcal{V}, \otimes, I)$. Free monad constructions are a special case, when we take $\mathcal{V}$ to be a monoidal category of endofunctors. There are at least two flavors: the free monoid on an object $X$, and the free monoid on a pointed object $I \to X$. It's pretty easy to construct the free monoid functor $T: \mathcal{V} \to \mathcal{V}$ in typical monoidal categories -- just take $T: X \mapsto \sum_{n=0}^\infty X^{\otimes n}$, or in the pointed case, $T: I \to X \mapsto \varinjlim_{n\to \infty} X^{\otimes n}$ using the map $I \to X$ to define semicosimplicial connecting maps. The issue is with defining multiplication. We want to say that $TX \otimes TX = \varinjlim_m X^{\otimes m} \otimes \varinjlim_n X^{\otimes n} = \varinjlim_{m,n}X^{\otimes m+n}$, and then define multiplication $\mu_X: T^2 X \to TX$ by the universal property of the colimit, setting $X^{m+n} \to T^2 X \overset{\mu_X}{\to} TX$ equal to $X^{m+n} \to TX$, where the unlabeled maps are the canonical colimit inclusions. If you think about this, you'll see it's the usual formula for multiplication in a free monoid. The diagrams all commute, so we can define this map $\mu_X$ with no problem. The problem is that the domain of $\mu_X$ is $\varinjlim_{m,n} X^{\otimes m+n}$, and in order to identify this with $T^2 X$, we had to commute a colimit past $\otimes$ -- we needed the functor $TX \otimes(-): \mathcal{V} \to \mathcal{V}$ to commute with the colimit defining $TX$. This is fine if $\otimes$ is (right) closed, in which case $TX \otimes(-)$ commutes with all colimits, so these simple constructions work in the familiar cases of free monoids in categories like $\mathsf{Set},\mathsf{Ab}$, etc. But right closedness is simply not true in a category of endofunctors $\mathcal{V} = [\mathcal{C},\mathcal{C}]$. The condition becomes slightly different in this setting -- if you start with $F$ and define $M(C) = \varinjlim_n F^n C$, you want to argue that $M^2(C) = \varinjlim_m F^m (\varinjlim_n F^n(C)) = \varinjlim_{m,n} F^{m+n}(C)$, for which it suffices for $F$ to commute with the colimits defining $M$. Unfortunately, this is not often the case, although I believe the semisimplex category is at least sifted, so if $F$ commutes with sifted colimits you might be in luck. Otherwise I don't know a shortcut to reading Kelly. I think the trick to reading his paper on a first pass must be to keep in mind that you can take the factorization system he uses to be $(M,E)$ = (all maps, isos), and then "preserving $E$-tightness of a cocone" just means preserving a colimit. What I currently understand is that Kelly gives free constructions endofunctor -> pointed endofunctor -> well-pointed endofunctor -> monad. I'm currently most mystified by the middle one. 

EDIT Thanks to Jeremy Rickard for several corrective insights in the comments! In the direction of positive conditions, I'm not sure whether the following conditions are reasonable for your purposes: Proposition: Let $\mathcal{C}$ be an abelian category which is 

In case you've never heard of lax-idempotent (KZ) monads, I've included some background and expanded on the above examples at the end. (N.B. I am blithely ignoring strictness considerations in this question.) The pattern: The general pattern I am getting at above is that a 2-monad on one 2-category $C$ can often fruitfully be replaced with a lax-idempotent 2-monad on a differerent 2-category $C'$, with the same algebras. Thus one trades objects of $C$ with certain structure for objects of $C'$ with certain properties. One wins if an object of $C'$ is not much harder to specify than an object of $C$, and the properties in question are easier to check than the structure in question is to specify. Sometimes it's not even feasible to describe the original 2-monad directly, but it is nonetheless one can approach its algebras via the alternative description. Question: Is there something systematic going on here? For example, is there some kind of adjunction between lax-idempotent 2-monads and all 2-monads, and we sometimes get lucky and find that it induces an equivalence of categories of algebras? I think that the work of Cruttwell and Shulman, and also of Hermida is somehow relevant here. But it seems that passing from a categorical structure to the "virtual" version gives slightly different KZ replacements than the ones I've listed above. For example, Cruttwell and Shulman's theory takes the 2-monad for symmetric monoidal categories, and yields the adjunction between symmetric monoidal categories and symmetric multicategories -- not the adjunction between symmetric monoidal categories and Gamma-categories. And in their framework, one still needs to work directly with the original 2-monad. Clubs also seem relevant, but I'm not sure they cover all the cases above. 

Elmendorff's theorem holds for an arbitrary compact group. So I'm pretty sure at least that there's no disagreement over what the $G$-equivariant categories -- stable and unstable -- should be for an arbitary compact group. Please correct me if I'm wrong here. I sometimes get the impression that there are real problems in setting up $G$-equivariant homotopy theory when $G$ is not finite -- for example, all the foundational $\infty$-categorical work of late seems to be done in the finite or profinite case. But I don't know what these problems could possibly be! By (1), it's perfectly clear what the orbit category should be. When stabilizing, the Haar measure should allow the kind of "sums" required to construct transfers. Where's the problem? If it's possible to do motivic equivariant homotopy theory over non-finite algebraic groups, then surely it's possible to work over compact Lie groups! It's true that non-discrete Lie groups are inconvenient to model as simplicial groups. Is this really a stumbling block? Perhaps people just focus on the groups they actually intend to work with. I don't know many existing or potential applications of equivariant homotopy theory over infinite groups. This is probably just my ignorance, since for that matter I don't know many existing or potential applications even over finite groups. For example in this overflow question I see Kervaire invariant one, the Segal conjecture, Galois descent for $\mathbb{C}$ over $\mathbb{R}$, and the study of spaces with $G$-action. These are all for $G$ finite, except maybe the last one, but it's also the vaguest. The other application that comes to mind is cyclotomic spectra and THH, where $G = S^1$ (but we use a universe with only the proper closed subgroups), which brings me to another confusion: THH should admit a genuine $S^1$-equivariant structure, but people tend to just use the cyclotomic part, using only the proper closed subgroups (which are all finite). Is this because (a) we'd like to use the $S^1$ part, but there's no model of it that's reasonable to work with, (b) we wouldn't have any use for the $S^1$ part even if we could get our hands on it (seems unlikely -- shouldn't this correspond to information at the infinite place?), or (c) even if we could get our hands on the $S^1$ part, thinking about it in equivariant terms would be the "wrong" approach, or require additional corrections, or (d) some other reason? 

Accessible, accessibly-embedded, reflective full subcategories $\mathcal{L} \subseteq \mathcal{K}^{[1]}$. Accessible, accessibly-embedded full subcategories $\mathcal{L} \subseteq \mathcal{K}^{[1]}$ which are closed under colimits and pushouts and retracts along arbitrary morphisms of $\mathcal{L}$. Full subcategories $\mathcal{L} \subseteq \mathcal{K}^{[1]}$ of the form $\mathcal{L} = {}^\perp(\mathcal{C}^\perp)$ for some small set $\mathcal{C} \subseteq \mathcal{K}^{[1]}$ (where for the moment I'm using the more standard convention that ${}^\perp$ denotes strong orthogonality. 

The proof is via the small object argument. Note that the "closure" conditions of (2) are always satisfied by a subcategory closed under ${}^\perp(()^\perp)$ in an arbitrary category. And consider this: if $f: A \to B$ is a morphism and you can form the pushout $B\cup_A B$ of $f$ along itself, then the lifting property with respect to the map $B \cup_A B \to B$ is equivalent to lifts with respect to $f$ being unique, which means that the orthogonality relation we're talking about (usually called weak orthogonality) can be used to express strong orthogonality (where unique lifts exist). And we get analogously: Theorem Let $\mathcal{K}$ be a locally presentable category and $\mathcal{K}^{[1]}$ its category of morphisms. Then the following are equivalent: 

Remark. Of course, really "being locally in $(\mathcal U, \mathcal{F})$" is a structure and not a property as suggested by the terminology -- $E \to B$ could be locally in $(\mathcal U, \mathcal{F})$ in many different ways (so the above definition really should be neatened up a bit -- I hope it's clear how to do this). With this in mind, it is natural to generalize the definition, replacing $(\mathcal U, \mathcal{F})$ by an arbitrary fibration over $\mathsf{Top}$ equipped with a map of fibrations to the codomain fibration $\mathsf{Top} \downarrow \mathsf{Top} \to \mathsf{Top}$. But I think this extra generality is not needed for the following. Examples. 

Here are a few more facts which seem relevant here. Let me adopt the Boyarchenko-Drinfeld terminology from the preprint I linked to in the comments above, and use the term "closed idempotent" for what I called "well-idempotent" in the question, and "open idempoent" for "co-well-idempotent". 

The notion of a (left, say) Bousfield localization of a model category doesn't seem to be invariant under Quillen equivalence. There are a lot of things that could go wrong. But I don't know any examples. So if anyone could help me out with even one of the below questions, I'd appreciate it. Let $M$ be a model category and $\mathrm{Ho} M$ its homotopy category. 

Fix a base scheme $S$. Stable and unstable motivic categories over $S$ are defined as certain categories of higher stacks on the Nisnevich site $Sm_S$ of smooth schemes over $S$. Why smooth? As a casual observer, I see two broad classes of possible reasons: 

$M= \mathrm{Mod}(T)$ and $U$ the usual forgetful functor. $M$ is $\mathsf{Set}_\mathrm{inj}$. $(M,U)$ is any AEC, as in (Q3). 

There's a kind of analogy between the way manifolds work and the way bundles work. Let me try to give some examples of the analogy (although there may be better ones). I'll stick to smooth manifolds and vector bundles for definiteness. 

$(\mathcal{K},I)$ permits the small object if: Every object of $\mathcal{K}$ which is the domain of an arrow in $I$ is $\mathrm{cof}(I)$-small. 

In the following I'll speak of coverages on $T^\mathrm{op}$ rather than co-coverages on $T$. Let me take the liberty of loosening your question. It seems a little funny to me to to ask that the finite coproduct cocones in $T^\mathrm{op}$ form a coverage on the nose. After all, the point of a coverage is to present a notion of sheaf, or equivalently a Grothendieck topology. And every set of cocones generates a Grothendieck topology by just throwing in all the additional sieves that the axioms of a Grothendieck topology tell you have to be in there. So let's just let $J$ be the Grothendieck topology on $T^\mathrm{op}$ generated by the finite coproduct cocones. In general there's no reason for this site to be subcanonical. But what I think you're really driving at is the question: 

Let $T$ be a theory, and $A$ be an algebraically closed set. Let $L$ be the lattice of algebraically closed subsets of $A$. Can one understand the kernel of the natural map $\chi: Aut(A) \to Aut(L)$? (The image of this map is also interesting to study, but it really is the kernel I'd like to know about.) When $T$ is "nice" (maybe some kind of stability condition) and $A$ is "large enough" (maybe some kind of rank condition EDIT: as became clear in the discussion in the comments, more than just a size condition is necessary -- some kind of "complexity" or "nondegeneracy" condition on the algebraic closure operation is probably necessary), I would hope that the following are canonically isomorphic: 

Let $\mathcal C_0$ be a small additive category with countable coproducts, and let $\mathcal C$ be the category of additive functors $\mathcal C^{op}_0 \to \mathsf{Ab}$ preserving countable products. Then by Lemma 1.3 and Prop 2.5 here, $\mathcal C$ is a cocomplete abelian category which is easily seen to be locally $\aleph_1$-presentable. Moreover, cokernels are computed "levelwise", so that the representables are a generating set of projective objects; in particular, $\mathcal C$ has enough projectives. But $\mathcal C$ is pretty far from being an additive presheaf category. Along with მამუკა ჯიბლაძე's example in the comments of sheaves on a complete boolean algebra, this makes it pretty clear that there are plenty of locally presentable abelian categories with enough projectives which are not additive presheaf categories. I'm still not sure about categories of quasicoherent sheaves, though. 

Set theorists have responded to the paucity of elementary embeddings $V \to V$ by considering elementary embeddings $V \to M$ where $M$ is not $V$. Whereas category theory suggests studying endofunctors $\mathsf{Set} \to \mathsf{Set}$ which satisfy nice properties weaker than being elementary embeddings (actually the first approach can be viewed as a special case of the second, since $M$ is generally assumed to be a non-elementary substructure of $V$, so we can compose $V \to M \subset V$ to get an endofunctor $V \to V$). This approach is much less developed; the only examples I happen to have come across are at the level of measurable cardinals:
