On Bill Maher show of April 21, 2017, he read a Pew poll comparing Republican and Democrats. He claims it shows that after the election, most Republicans think we are doing much better economically, when the data shows a slight continuing uptick. On bombing Syria, when Obama wanted to bomb Syria and that only 22% of Republicans approved, but a new Pew poll supposedly shows 88% of Republicans approved of Trump’s bombing of Syria. Democrats held the same 32-37% approval for the bombing, for Trump and Obama. They also did survey on our income tax system. Republicans went from 39% thinking it is fair to 56% thinking it is fair. This poll would seem to show that Republicans change their opinion of the same data based upon who is in office whereas Democrats maintain their opinions more rationally. Is this just bias in the system or are these findings legitimate? Were the polls conducted in unfair ways to get the data to show the results desired by an agenda? Are Pew polls considered to be fair and if so, are they being misrepresented to put forth a political agenda? 

This NPR article from 2009 states that Dean Radin conducted a Love study that claimed to show a scientifically meaningful correlation between a husband thinking about a wife and her sensing it within two seconds: 

The 3M company has a product called 3M™ Precise™ Mouse Pad with Repositionable Adhesive Backing and Battery Saving Design, MP200PS that claims to: 

Is this real science? Has the statistical analysis been properly conducted? Is it really confirmed by 3 dozen double blind randomized studies at reputable institutions? 

I'm wondering if these claims are significant? Does such a seat provide a significant benefit to rib protection as compared to using a good vest like this one? Does such a seat provide any significant performance benefit (e.g. more than 0.25% faster) in outdoor karting such as at Sonoma raceway for a driver near the top of the field in Senior Rotax? I spoke with another dealer that does not sell these carbon fiber seats and they indicated that on the performance side the Original Equipment Manufacturer's (OEM's) seat that came with the kart should give the best performance since it was designed for the kart chassis specifically and that regarding rib protection, using a good rib cage (such as the one they sell) is much more effective that the benefit any seat can provide. 

Since the original article wasn't mentioned in the question, here's a link with abstract: MEIER MH, et. al. Persistent cannabis users show neuropsychological decline from childhood to midlife. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2012 Oct 2;109(40):E2657-64. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1206820109. Epub 2012 Aug 27. The purpose of the study, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, was to 

If someone has 300 gr of Turkey, that alone is almost 600 calories (without the filling or gravy), add a couple of pumpkin pies, you are already over the thousand. With rolls, alcohol and snack you might get to the 4500, or not. There is a lot of variation. In both cases, the single meal is over the daily recommended ingestion, which is around 2000-2500 calories a day. 

If you break it down by the numbers, it seems to be closer to the 3K than 4,5K, but the variation can be huge depending on what drinks and snacks there are. 

So although it is not exactly know how much there is yet to be explored (aerial images show a plateau that continues 1 km to the west), there is a general agreement that those areas will not be as settlement dense as the centre. 

If you double all the dimensions of a stone building supported on stone pillars, the weights are all increased eightfold, but the supporting capacities only go up fourfold. This all applies to animals and humans too: 

I'll try to summarize why the evidence, in this case and other similar ones, is considered not conclusive. The scientific community agrees on America being populated as late as 13-17k years ago, and as early as 40k: 

This is not true. Most of Palenque has been thoroughly surveyed, mapped and documented. While not all areas have been excavated, there has been extensive analysis of the settlement. 

There is no scientific backing for this classification. What is referenced as "Greek" is actually called Morton's toe (name derived from the surgeon who described is as a foot syndrome), but it's so common that this congenital short first metatarsal bone is considered a normal variant of foot shape. In statuary and shoe fitting it has been called Greek foot, because it was an idealized form in Greek sculpture. It also persisted as an aesthetic standard through Roman and Renaissance periods: 

Children, the younger they are, the more they are susceptible to febrile seizures which can occur during an infection. The safest place to be whilst having a seizure is on a soft surface like a mattress, not say, climbing a tree or swinging across a river on a rope. The above reference gives that it is best to place the patient in the recovery position to prevent choking on vomitus. This can be done if the child is in sight of the parent/guardian, which may best be done on the sofa or in bed, depending on the layout of the house. As an adult, you may well be able to function relatively normally with a bacterial condition, but if you have a fever and you exercise, your temperature may reach dangerously high, ie. >= 38 Celsius, whereupon you may seize, which could be dangerous depending on where this happens. Two facts are also relevant: 1/ Antibiotics can and do put a strain on the kidneys. 2/ A large amount of aerobic exercise - such as running a marathon - will cause the breakdown of a certain percentage of erythrocytes in the blood and a release of myoglobin in the damaged muscles (this is perfectly normal). This also stresses out the kidneys. Conditions such as Rhabdomyolysis make matters worse. The Above two items occurring at the same time may cause irreparable kidney damage, leading to necessitate dialysis or transplant. Tell your medical professional if you plan such strenuous activities, and take their advice is the best thing you can do here. 

Auto-immune conditions such as pernicious anemia can cause B12 deficiency, which in turn causes lethargy and tiredness. Here. Also, in people in good health otherwise, those who take acid supressors for 2 years or more stand a chance of developing B12 deficiency. Here. Currently no particular vitamin is associated with Ginkgo Biloba, but as has been noted above, Ginkgo Biloba may produce some measurable benefits in some subsets of people tested, but are not considered generally successful.: Here. (same reference as Guru42's answer, just read a little more of the article and you'll see it's benefits are not considered of great significance.) I am unable to find any reputable article which demonstrates that vitamin supplements are of any benefit to the memory of (ie. enhance the memory of) people who otherwise lie within the normal range of health. 

Adding to Articuno's answer, the reason no remains of the type have been found is because adult hominids taller than (about) 9 feet simply can't exist. It's about physics: If you double the height of any being, its surface area quadruples, and its volume triples. While lengths scale linearly (x), areas scale quadratically (x^2) and volumes scale cubically (x^3). This means that a human as big as those in your examples would not reach adulthood. The oldest remains of a person with gigantism are those of a man that lived close to Rome in third-century A.D. Gigantism itself is extremely rare (about three people in a million worldwide today). 'Giants' can't exist because it's a scaling issue. Galileo was one of the first to point it out: 

Findings are suggestive of a neurotoxic effect of cannabis on the adolescent brain. As DrugAbuse points out, this loss seems to also be consistent with findings in animal studies. The length of the study, publication, number of participants and variables considered show good methodology. The difference between the two studies mentioned in the question is that the second had a large enough sample to account for socioeconomical differences, and found no direct correlation them and IQ loss associated with cannabis use. 

Yes. Homo sapiens is, as far as we know, the only species that has permanently enlarged breasts. In the rest of the primates, plump breasts last only as long as breastfeeding does: 

Exploration Palenque is considered a medium-sized site. It was surveyed and mapped in 2000 through a project called the Palenque Mapping Project (PMP): 

Excavation Not all areas that were charted have been excavated. Excavations are invasive and destructive, not to mention really expensive when done in the jungle, as trees keep growing and burying structures each year. It's rare to find completely excavated cities, though, especially when newer structures have been built on top of old ones, and the land is in private hands. Maintenance can also be a big issue for these sort of sites. The biggest structures in Palenque have been explored to detail from 1922, however, and those can be considered representative of the city as a whole. You can see the full list of excavations and investigations in the Palenque Project website. Also, the map is impressive, so here's a smaller version:
