In a world were armor and weapons are made out of cacti. I’m going to make two assumptions. Cacti are being used because of a lack of other resources (wood and metal are rare/nonexistent), and that they are real life cacti. Size of an army: The two limiting factors are number of people willing to fight, and the number of fresh cacti available. Style of warfare: My understanding of mini house cactus anatomy says the needles are the hardest part. My limited experience eating dried cactus snacks say that dried cactus is still rather soft and squishy. Thin cacti could be used as makeshift spiked clubs if the handle area is cleared of needles. These extra needles could be implanted in the club or in a pair of gloves. I don’t imagine the cactus club will survive multiple strikes. I also cannot imagine a warrior carrying more than one(maybe two) at a time. So I imagine combat between two groups would start off with a cactus dual of sorts and once they break it becomes an all-out brawl. (this is where the needle glove might be useful) Larger cacti could be cut into armor like objects. Like the club I cannot imagen that the cactus armor will last too many strikes. I would not dry the armor out, you want it thick enough to stop a needle. The main purpose of the armor would be to stop the initial needle club attack. If it survives the initial attack it may disway your opponent from grappling you in the brawl segment of the battle. One thing to keep in mind is that there will be a lot of broken cacti bits on the ground. I think good boots would be a necessity. Slip proof and cacti caltrop proof. 

To answer how an altruistic society might evolve, look at what caused it to evolve to be the way it is now. Most of human history there was scarcity of food and a lot of danger from predators or other human tribes competing for food, so physical strength and ability to amass resources were very important for survival or the group, so such people were viewed positively by society. In the modern world fighting off bears is less of a concern, and a much bigger problem might be environmental collapse. If you extrapolate that further, you could say that in few short thousands of years (or hundreds if you want to be optimistic), humans will evolve to dislike greed, due to it's wastefulness and environmental concerns, while emphasising non-violent cooperation, since efficient use of resources is more important then fighting off things. Eventually creativity, ability to get along and not-hoarding things might become more socially desired then strength and wealth. Also robots will do all the heavy lifting so who needs strength, am I right? 

Use one or more Supper humans to make them. In my humble opinion and as described in the comments by others, I don't think there is a logical way of removing free will, but leaving a still useful logical mind behind. The closes you could get is with some hand waving. Let there be one (or more) supper humans friendly to your cause that don't mind playing 'warden'. Give them some kind of mind control, or alliance reassignment ability. Every day they can remind the prisoners that the Warden is there friend, and they not only like but want to help the warden out. If your organization does not like the idea of having super humans in charge. There is the option of more hand waving, and using psychic recordings of the original warden. Maybe at one time they had a super human, with a alliance reassignment ability. Before that particulate super human escaped/died/terminated/retired they build up a whole library of basic "Obey me" commands that they play over the load speakers. 

There are so many ways to incite rebellion, but in general find out what people are most fearful or angry about and who they are suspicious of, then blame the latter for the former, while insinuating that the government is protecting them. If you want them to be less evil and go after the government directly it could be harder depending on what sort of the reputation the leaders have, sometimes oppressive people are popular (ex. Vladimir Putin). There probably needs to be more information to really provide a detailed answer, but other common tactics include provocations, sabotage, pretending to be the rightful king or queen, accusing the ruling class of having a different religion or not believing in the dominant one, accusing then of not being real members of the nation (if they have some foreign parentage) 

This is probably not what you wanted but it could be useful for a different world building. Maybe these creatures latterly just have crystal material build up in their eyes. . It is not a beneficial trait, but a trait they learn to live with. As infants they have good vision to help protect them as they learn to walk and what food is good to eat. In adolescence their vision starts to fade as the crystals start to form in their eyes. (Rhino’s have poor vision but can still function) As full grown adults they are blind and now rely fully on their sense of smell and hearing. If someone were to harvest an eye they would notice that they resemble geodes Maybe these creatures constantly grow new eyes as they age. If this were the case you could get a rough idea of how old they were by the number of crystallized eyes they have. 

I've read some conflicting theories regarding ancient atmosphere (some say it had more oxygen, but others dispute it) being relevant to survival of large dinosaurs. So my question is: is it realistic, from the point of view of known science to have Cretaceous Period dinosaur alive today? (Assuming it was successfully brought over somehow, maybe in a large time-truck) 

In general, totalitarian (and other despotic) regimes are great at huge unreasonably expensive projects, just look at the pyramids, or the terracotta army and the whole mountain sized complex that houses it. The only real costs to the regime leaders are time and natural resources. Are they willing to concentrate on a project that may not yield any interesting results before they are dead? Does using resources (including people) to make it happen divert those resources from something else they want have accomplished? Currency would probably not mean anything to the regime (they already own everything that can be bought with it) 

I know you are looking for the color of the material it is made out of, but unfortunately it might be painted neon-yellow or neon-orange like a traffic sign. Some color to make it stand out when you are looking at a night sky or clear blue sky background. Just to help plans and space ships from accidentally hitting it. 

Crystal “cellphone tower” There still is some hand-waving magic going on, but to a degree it works. One of the objects your main character comes across, builds or enchanted is a crystal that somehow queried the entire internet during its creation and saved a static image of it. Now their cell phone (while in signal range of the crystal tower) can communicate with it as though it had access to a cell tower. There are no other phones on the network so outgoing calls are useless, but there are lots of DNS address with fixed content waiting to be accessed. How this crystal queried the entire internet is a little iffy. That’s got to be a powerful spell, or at least a very large crystal. Maybe it’s actually a full tower, not just a crystal sitting at the top of a tower. A little world building, maybe it’s not a perfect copy of the main character’s worlds internet, maybe it’s a perfect copy of a universe very closely related to their universe. With there being infinite possible universes eventually you will have to settle for close enough.
