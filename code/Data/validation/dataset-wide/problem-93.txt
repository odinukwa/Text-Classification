No, it is not possible. Not even remotely. At least not with Earth mammalian biology being what it is. Bones can only get so big. But hey, we had some pretty tall dinosaurs walking around, so why not a giant human? It comes down to joints, blood circulation, and a bunch of other fun stuff like that. Basically, once you reach a certain size our basic biology just can't keep up anymore. An 80 foot giant would swing an arm, and snap its bones in half, as the muscle power required to move its limbs would be greater than the strength of its bones. If we were devising a different creature, with multiple hearts, a different circulatory system, etc. it might work out, however. Some of the earlier, massive dinosaurs are believed to have had 2 hearts anyway, so it can happen. If you look at the history of our world in fossils you will notice that even the dinosaurs got progressively smaller as we get closer to modern times. Same with the megafauna that dominated our planet a few hundred thousand years ago. The more complex our biology became, the smaller we evolved to be. This is not a coincidence. Even blue whales, whose weight is suspended by the oceans they live in suffer from diseases related to their size by the time they die. At best you are likely to reach 15 feet, but what we end up with, does not look human. 

No Matter (in its basic concept) exists in 3 forms; Solid, Liquid and Gas. Heating a solid will give you a liquid, heat that and you got a gas, heat that and you have yourself Plasma. Now Robots are nothing more than complex machine and machines as we recognize them (pieces of matter moving in a certain way to serve a certain purpose), while sometimes contained gas or liquid, are predominately solid. Thus while a robot can contain Plasma, it cannot be made of it. 

As the world is so dim it is possible that eyesight works similar to solar panels. The creatures that live there might be nocturnal, spending the day ''charging'' their eyes so that when they are awake, they can see. They might also just see in a lower light frequency that doesn't require as much light or energy from their sun. Finally the simplest, most boring answer ever; they see just like we do, but darker. 

The reaction would be panic, chaos, and confusion. To the extent that the wish would quite possibly never be wished because there would be no consensus on what it should be or who should wish it. As for the wish, I would suggest something like 

I was reading about the rogue planet PSO J318.5-22 which is thought to have molten iron rain and things like that, and I vaguely remembered from uni that almost all iron mixtures have a slushy eutectic phase. So I got to thinking, could you have life based on the impurities and crystal structures in that phase, with iron as the solvent? Different crystal systems can seed each other and self-replicate that way, different metals and metal complexes have various catalytic properties, and so on. I don't plan on mapping out the details of that kind of biology, just want an opinion on whether or not it's vaguely plausible. 

For a being that desires to help humanity grow and not subject us to trickery, it has a very funny way of going about it. Growth and development are inevitable assuming we survive, so the offer of the wish with all it's ensuing disruption and conflict is counter productive. 

Personally, I would simply wait out my initial 30 days. I have absolutely no desire for immortality, I'm a gay man, and I've survived sexual assault and am therefore rather touchy about sex under duress. Death seems very much preferable to living in this scenario. 

This would very rapidly take humanity to a much higher female:male ratio. Since sex with pregnant women counts less, you need at least five women for every man, probably considerably more. It is quite possible that one sex will make a commodity the other. Certainly sex work will have the biggest boon in human history and become legitimate, since access to sex becomes a survival necessity. I wouldn't be surprised to find brothels in every supermarket. Effectively you're keeping women perpetually pregnant, which results in a massive population growth. You'd get about 60% increase globally every year: even converting all available land to high-intensity agriculture and the entire population living on GM rice, we'd exceed the Earth's total ability to feed us within a few years. To manage that I would expect the immediate, total and compulsory use of non-barrier contraception. I would think everybody would receive contraceptive implants, and probably some license system would be used give people a break from them and have children. Back of the envelope calculations suggest that there would be no stable population level, and humanity would be condemned to boom-bust cycles. The loss of barrier contraception would also massively increase the prevalence of STIs. That could cause people to form closed networks of sexual partners, with strict rules on health and fidelity, which in the long run could displace the family. Health, particularly mental health, will take a massive hit. LGBT people will be especially badly affected for obvious reasons. Monogamous relationships will effectively become impossible. People will become traumatised by the necessity of involuntary sex. Mental health problems will also suddenly carry a huge risk of death, since both problems and treatments are strongly associated with sexual problems. Last, but certainly not least, our concept of sexual consent will probably go out the window. An act is not a crime if it really is necessary for survival, so committing rape about one a month would be a valid lifestyle choice. 

Specifications Existing floating rigs and fixed platform rigs hold about the same weight; the heaviest today being the floating Hibernia. It can hold 58,000 tons while in operation. With depths in international waters, a floating platform is recommended. A plain office tower that is 10 stories high would weigh in at about 800 tons for foundation and an additional 100 tons per floor (I was an urban planner - these are high-level numbers, though) coming to 1,800 tons, well within Hibernia's capacity for weight (not structural integrity). So let's up the ante. 20 Stories will get you 1,600 ton foundation and 2,000 tons for floors. You're now at 3,600 tons. You can further the math. But the weight is not the issue. The height is. After about four floors, you're going to start getting massive issues with wind and waves. With a top-heavy floating tower, you will be bobbing around all over the place. So instead, I would recommend you flatten out your tower, and have a very wide, four story building, with extra floating 'legs' in the water. Not very sexy, I know. A four story building, weighing 58,000 tons would take up about 360m (1/4mi) x 360m square, allowing for utilities and transportation equipment. This is a nice, large block of space. We consider 350m to be 'walking distance,' for access to facilities in urban planning. You have a four story indoor city. Bonus, you have a lot of space on the roof for gardens and solar power generation. Legality The location should be in international waters. While this does not grant you immunity from the law (any illegal action can be prosecuted by any country in international waters, although flag countries' law usually is what it's based on), it does allow some autonomy. Location Storms are very rough in the Atlantic, so I would recommend you place it just outside Portugal's jurisdiction around the Azores, for some shelter, and access to nearby facilities (air strip), resources (port to bring food in), and emergency evacuations. Autonomy I'm guessing nobody will really bother you, but you'll have to do a lot if you intend to establish your own country and be legitimized by other states. EDIT: So you want a little bit higher? I think you could have stability at 20 storeys now that I've done a little math. A similar 20-story structure could be 280m x 280m, and I think that would be flat enough to hold still in the winds off the Azores. Edge the sides off and onto the top to make a short-fat pyramid, and you can get greater height. /Edit What can this hold? I don't know what your breakdown of uses are, but either structure size can hold a healthy breakdown (inlcuding the utility, hallways, etc.)of: 

First question is jurisdiction. Is this an independent colony, under it's own sovereignty, or is it a colony of an Earth based nation? If the former, then it's really a question about international human rights conventions, if the latter then it depends on the nation. Either way, the defence is basically quod est necessarium est licitum, that which is necessary is lawful, and for the premeditated killing of hundreds of people ... well, no amount of rationalisation, no matter how foolproof, is going to get you off completely. It's politics as much as justice. Let's face it, we in the developed world like our killing to happen in small, regular, impersonal batches. There's a lot of other factors which will affect the outcome, but I doubt things look good for our poor governor. He better hope that he's tried in EU jurisdiction where there's no capital punishment, because he will be tried and it could easily go either way. 

You could build a small flux-compression generator into a bullet, possibly replacing the explosive charge with simply the impact force. That would give you the combined effect of an hollow or explosive round with an electromagnetic pulse which I imagine would be quite good against cyborgs. 

I have some aliens. They look a bit like giant land-squid, and they have two very interesting characteristics. First off, their central nervous system never stops growing, so intelligence and age are well correlated, although in extreme old age when the brain has grown beyond the body's ability to support it dementia and death are inevitable. Second is their reproductive cycle. Beneath their mantles they have three "bud sites". If left vacant a new bud containing the individual's haploid genetic material will form. A bud kept in a bud site will stay viable for years, but without a host they only survive a few hours. They swap buds with each other, and when they're ready they close up their mantles and the three buds, as well as the gestational parent's own contribution, merge together and a baby thing is formed. So there are no distinct sexes, and everyone has four parents. As I imagine it, this makes reproduction like a gigantic trading card game. Individuals are constantly swapping buds (not necessarily even their own) to get desirable combinations of characteristics for their offspring. Offspring are raised by their gestational parent and may not even know who the other parents are. As an extension of all this I've imagined that their culture is based primarily around games and strategy, and historically their societies tend to be gerontocracies (although the age-intelligence correlation makes the distinction between gerontocracy and meritocracy rather fuzzy). My question is what happens to their society when their technology advances to provide for life-extension, intelligence augmentation, and the ability to store and preserve viable buds outside the body? More specifically, I'm thinking that their biology has given them a fairly natural social setup, but what sort of society might they end up with once those biological factors are mitigated by technological progress. If they're anything like us different groups will seize the opportunity to push for greater rights and equality, but on the other hand even though any natural reasons have gone certain things will be deeply embedded in identity and culture. I have some ideas, for example that success in games will become a more important factor than age in power structures, but I'm going all over the place and struggling to get much that's coherent so I wanted some fresh perspectives. 

Excellent question. I don't know if it has ever been done. Substitution and Transposition First, re-arranging map elements, such as a mountain-replaced-by-a-body-of-water. But this is recognizable to someone familiar with your region. Next, re-assembly of the mapped region by squares of, say 500m x 500m, so that there is a distortion that only your readers can understand how to re-assemble it. Smooth out the features so that they blend together and you have a map of an un-recognizable region with features that are not familiar to anyone from 'round here. Your readers then take up the scissors and re-assemble and re-substitute. Feel free to throw in classic cryptography of the names of features or strategic positions after that. 

Sperm whales can go 90 minutes at a time without needing to surface. I am interested in an idea for a creature that is air-breathing, but spends a lot of time at depths of (100m to 300m) and sometimes briefly on land. An adult is about the size of a human, and is warm-blooded, although not necessarily mammal. An air-breathing version of a mermaid/man, that spends weeks under water without surfacing. I'm flexible on shape and form, but I'm after the biological modifications I have to make to such an air-breathing animal who spends its weeks-long migration periods submerged under the ocean surface. 

Religion - sheep are religious features from at least as early as the 8,000 BC and today, and for your timeperiod the more, the better. They're featured in many cultures in that time, even to the Arab world. Food, clothing, milk - You said it yourself; mutton-pie, anyone? Not sure if your bear-people need wool clothing, but the bear part probably doesn't. Beasts of burden - After years of training (and with sheep, we're talking a long time), your bear-people have domesticated the sheep to do some of the labor: pulling carts and plows, turning the grain-grinding-thingy. Other uses - Bits of sheep can also be found in tennis rackets (strings made of sheep guts), candles and soap (tallow rendered from sheep fat) and most cosmetics and skincare products (lanolin, an emollient found in sheep's wool). Precedent - it's not without precedent to have a place overrun with sheep. When I lived in New Zealand, there was a ratio of 20 sheep per person. Flora? - Perhaps in your tundra world, there still exists a fast-growing, pesky grass; and these sheep just love to eat it.
