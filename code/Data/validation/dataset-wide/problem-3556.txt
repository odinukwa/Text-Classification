The most important take away is that the bar will be going across your shoulders. I have seen video of people like Max Aita squat with no hands on the bar. I will say that I don't entirely agree with Rippetoe's hand placement and elbow position recommendations, but they will be good enough to get you started and that's something you can figure out later. The biggest difference of opinion has to do with the elbows going back. I find it better for them to stay parallel with the body. If you feel like too much weight is in your elbow, then you probably have the hands too close to the body. That's what works for me at any rate. 

A lot of the answer depends on your goals and the exercise you are doing. Our bodies are marvelous creations that can adapt to a wide range of stresses over time. However, there are a few principles you can use to apply to your exercise regimen: 

Also considering where your squats are, it can be that the squats are robbing your energy for the bench press. Switching to 3x5 even though you didn't stall will make it a whole lot easier to make more progress on your bench press and rows. 

With those disclaimers out of the way, I can say without a doubt you are using the the formula incorrectly. The formulas become more useful when you understand about the different adaptations that happen with rep ranges. Granted, even the rep ranges are only useful to a point--but it helps to understand how to design your work around your goals: 

As a complete beginner, there really isn't a huge reason not to. What it does is give you more practice, at the expense of energy. The time to back off and just do the 3x5 is when you feel run down before you start. This is how you adapt the load to what you can do right now. When 3x5 gets you run down all the time, it's time to switch things up and go for slower increases. That said, make sure the practice you are doing is good practice. You don't want to reinforce bad habits. 

You can find that for your current ability you can find the sweet spot once you know how long you can maintain any given intensity. But it also shows that if you only have so much time available, you can increase the load by increasing the intensity. Lower intensity (i.e. lower heart rate) burns more fat percentage wise, and higher intensity (i.e. higher heart rate) burns more sugar percentage wise. The volume of calories burned can outweigh the benefits of a low heart rate workout assuming you only have so much time. The above is a simplification of everything, because our bodies don't linearly progress in the number of calories burned as you increase your intensity. You get to a certain threshold and the number of calories burned jumps way higher. 

The biggest risk of injury comes from overuse, particularly if you are getting older. Body weight exercises are very safe, and the biggest real risk of not doing them correctly is wasting time because you won't get the results you want. The key to pushups is keeping your body straight as a board. If your body is sagging in the middle, it's likely because your abs are too weak. If you do some situps to help strengthen the abs, you should be able to get to the point of doing a proper pushup soon. Another approach is to do your pushups from your knees until you can do those with proper form. Pullups are great, and even if you do kipping pullups or jumping up to get started, you will get stronger. Eventually, you will want to do them with strict form, but it takes time to be able to do that. Doing body weight squats with bad form also won't put you at risk of injury. You just won't be getting the benefit from them that you desire. If you work on breaking from the hips, and going as deep as you can, you will get more benefit from them. Eventually you can work up to squat-jumps where you squat down, and jump up from that position as high as you can. There are other body weight exercises that are quite useful such as: 

You will be strengthening most of those muscles. That combined with common assistance exercises like rows, back extensions, planks, and other core work will be the majority of what is needed. It is not common for such small muscles to be limiting factors for beginners, and even many intermediate lifters. As such, focusing on the main lifts will help you get all your muscles stronger. Additionally, it is unlikely you will ever need to directly strengthen your neck unless you intend on ramming your head into someone like a football player. The main lifts will strengthen it as the body maintains rigidity throughout the lifts. 

The bottom line is be intelligent about what you eat and why. Don't simply take someone's word for it, but find out the purpose behind the recommendation, the side effects, the time frame recommended, etc. Milk is not evil, but it is not the end all and be all either. When you are trying to gain weight, GOMAD (or the 2-3L a day) can be an effective means to do so--particularly if you have a hard time gaining weight. It won't be all muscle, but it will be more muscle than fat if you are putting in work at the gym. There will also be a fair amount of water retention. If you don't have problems gaining weight, then no GOMAD is not what you want. You want to control the rate of gaining weight so that it is mostly muscle. Stick with regular food for your protein intake. 

The two beginners programs that seem to be really good are StrongLifts 5x5 (SL) and Starting Strength (SS). Medhi (the guy behind SL) has been going on a salesmanship spree lately, so you will have a lot to ignore, but the core program he has works and works well. His is a 5 sets/5 reps scheme. Rippetoe (the guy behind SS) is a pretty down to earth kind of guy with a dry sense of humor. His book is very good as far as teaching technique and what to look for as a beginner. SS is a 3 sets/5 reps scheme. So, you should be very effective at building strength using: 

In this position, the only thing that will prevent you from staying in a tight set up is if the floor or your shoes are slick. If I'm unsure about the floor, I'll make sure the heals of my feet lock down so they touch the bench supports. Uncommon causes of hamstring pulls/strains 

I have to ask if you are using the Valsalva Maneuver while lifting the heavy weights. According to the article I linked to, blurry vision is a side effect of taking the Valsalva Maneuver too far. Every lifter is different, and that phenomenon only happens when you are pushing your limits. The bad news is that as the weight gets heavier, the risk of passing out due to the Valsalva maneuver increases. For bench presses, the safest bet is to press in a power rack with the safety bars above your neck. If you do pass out you won't get injured. However, it is a useful tool to get those heavy weights up. In some cases its the only way to get those heavy weights up. You may be able to lessen the impact if you incorporate aerobic exercise after your weight lifting. Aerobic exercise like jogging will help your heart become larger and pump more volume of blood per beat--somewhat easing the circumstances that cause Valsalva retinopathy. 

There can be many reasons for muscle spasms/pulls in the neck area, including (in no particular order): 

The short answer is that you aren't deadlifting enough to really feel anything. You can pull more weight on a deadlift than just about any other compound exercise. The big thing to concentrate on is: 

The first two questions really attack the same thing from opposite sides of the coin to get you to think about the role of lifting in what you want to do. The remaining questions also help refine what type of training programs you will be interested in. From the content in the question, I can guess at some of your answers: 

The heavy day helps get the body used to heavier weights to enable increasing weight over time. The rep day is the meat and potatoes of getting stronger. Speed day is kind of a mental break and active recovery day--while focusing on moving weight quickly. Since I have 3 main compound movements, I alternate which one gets which emphasis. I also make sure each main compound movement gets a different emphasis for that day. That way I'm not going heavy on bench and deadlift in the same session. 

Finally, understand that the lifting community has five classes of lifter that are defined not by how much they can lift, but by how long it takes for their bodies to adapt: 

Starting with basic strength training: Both Rippetoe's and Medhi's strength programs will have you using slow compound lifts while you are getting all your beginner gains. For this purpose, just about any set of weights will work. Now, Rippetoe's program has you doing power cleans. In order to pull that off you need a bar where the sleeves rotate so that the weights remain stationary and you aren't killing yourself with their momentum. When you are just starting out, it might be a good idea to get your starter set using the advice in @Greg's answer. In the beginning you just need to start moving iron. It will be a bit of time before you start maxing out what your starter set can do for you. I personally have done this with my gym subscription, and am looking for the home gym now that I'm totally serious about this. Keep the following things in mind: 

Person A will need to lose a total of 17 lbs and person B will need to lose a total of 15 lbs. This is closer to 4 months of work. If you consider that a short amount of time, then yes it can be done quickly. If you consider that a long period of time, then no it can't be done quickly. 

While cutting does present a head wind, most of us are not pushing so close to the edge of our potential (me included) that you can still continue to progressively get stronger while eating fewer calories. If you have a scale that estimates body fat, you may see your estimated lean mass shrinking. Do not be alarmed! Not all lean mass is muscle, some of it is water retention, some of it is misreported. In either case, your fat weight should be shrinking faster than the lean mass. As long as you are improving month to month in the gym, you are getting stronger. From the Performance Nutrition Encyclopedia One of the things that the Josh Thigpen suggests is a pre/intra/post workout nutrition were you have a combination of quick carbs and protein for each of these. 

Achy pain is usually just DOMS. However, if the bar was set up too high, it can be the pressure of the bar on your muscles. Without being able to check your form (in person or in video), it's really hard to say exactly what it is. These are the two most likely explanations given your description. 

First, understand that stress in any form depresses your immune system. Lifting weights is a training stress, and in particular deadlifts can really push you over the edge. The goal is that when the stress is lifted and you recover you are at a stronger position. I have no idea what your current stats are with the squat, bench, deadlift, overhead press, and barbell rows. A year is a long time to be on that beginner program. Some things to consider: 

Lastly, according to Mark Rippetoe in the Starting Strength book, deadlifts are an effective exercise when done correctly to prevent further injury. If you don't have the book, I highly recommend getting it. There's a lot of good tips on recognizing form problems and correcting them. 

Light strength training to rehabilitate your elbow would include both elbow flexion (some form of curl) and extension (press or cable triceps extensions). Use a light weight that won't aggravate the joint, and that you can use for 3 or 4 sets of 10-15 reps. After doing this 3x a week for a couple weeks or so, you should notice the joint feeling better. Give more emphasis to the action that you use less. Also, do not lock the elbows during extension related exercise because your goal is to flush blood through the joint. IMPORTANT: If your injury is due to a known injury during the sport, do get it checked out to make sure there isn't any non-inflammation related damage. If there is traumatic injury in addition to inflammation, the protocol I outlined will make things worse until the trauma has been remedied. 

The weight I use for my rows is much lighter than my bench press. I make up for that fact by doing more reps with the rows than I do with the bench. For example, I may be benching in excess of 120kg and rowing with 55kg. The ratio isn't so important as it is the fact you are using the heaviest weight you can do for 20+ reps. Since your routine is mostly body weight exercises, perhaps a better match would be inverted rows. Essentially you have a bar, desk, or table over you and you pull yourself up to it. If you can do pull ups, those would also be excellent additions to your routine. 

During non-training days you can either skip this altogether, or just have one 2-scoop protein shake during that time of day. All other food should be regular food. The reason for this is to time carbohydrates and protein to give you more energy throughout your workouts, as well as put your body in the best condition to make use of the protein and carbs. I.e. more goes to muscle and less to fat. (Source is the Performance Nutrition Encyclopedia). Training Changes You need to maintain your lower body strength while building your upper body strength/mass. For a training split, I would use 3 days where two days are upper body days and 1 is a lower body day. Feel free to adapt things to suit you better, but this basic structure will help: Day 1: Triceps/Shoulders/Lats 

You can stick with the incline if you want, but this will give you a bit more variation. The back extensions work a bit more of your posterior chain than the glute bridges and leg curls. By the time you can leg press your body weight for reps, you should be a lot more stable than you used to be. Ideally, you would build up to being able to do goblet squats, and then barbells squats up to your body weight. However, your journey is likely to be different. You may have to make some changes to the ideas I put up for you based on ability. If your balance issue is more of an inner ear problem rather than strength, you may never be able to squat--but there are things you can do. 

It depends on the sport. Soccer and Football (I'm speaking as an American here) both use long socks to hold the shin guards in place. The shin guards provide extra padding to prevent injuries from errant kicks and tackles. The long socks are also in the team colors so the referees can easily identify which team the players are on even when the jersey isn't visible (such as in a pileup). Other sports like basketball don't have shin guards and the sock height is more of a personal style as they have changed over the years. Usually the team will be consistent so the players look uniform. 

These are all places fat tends to gather, or are used in body fat estimators. So, by tracking the sizes of these say monthly (no more frequently than weekly) you should see the sizes get smaller. Add up the differences at each of the sites and that's how many inches you have lost. In my book inches lost is more important than pounds on a scale. Now, the .5g/pound lean body weight is a minimum for someone with a sedentary lifestyle. If you have an active job, you may need to increase it proportionally (use a limit of 1g/pound lean body weight to start with). Weight lifters will probably go above this, but if you are a runner or do endurance sports it should be plenty. Just be sure to add an additional source of protein right after your workout to help the muscles rebuild themselves. This is in addition to your daily allowance. You want to at least maintain your muscle mass, if not increase it. Just a note about the recommended calorie allowance: those are estimated based on your Basal Metabolic Rate. Without getting that properly tested they are using some math to calculate what it should be based on what they think your fat free mass (lean body weight) is. The simplest calculation to get in the ballpark is the BMI which is simply taking your weight in pounds and dividing by your height in inches. It's close enough for government work, but not when you are trying to shave off a couple pounds. Recommendation: Feed yourself the recommended calorie allowance your app tells you. Don't arbitrarily cut a lot of calories out. If you are gaining weight, decrease the recommended calorie allowance by 200. If you are maintaining, decrease by 100. If you are losing, leave it alone. Re-evaluate yourself weekly. Your BMR changes as your muscle mass changes. If you are constipated, use something like milk of magnesia or magnesium citrate to get things moving again. Re-evaluate your fiber intake.
