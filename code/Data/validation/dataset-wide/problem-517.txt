When I've had that happen before, it's never that the cable actually disconnected inside the brake lever, it's either disconnected at the brake or one of the cable housing stops. Does the other brake still work? Can you see how the cable end is connected in that lever? First, check the brake. Different brakes have different styles of how it's done, but there's usually some way to quickly release the brake (to make it easier to remove the wheel). Second, check the cable all the way from the brake to the lever. The cable will run the whole way, of course, but the housing that the cable runs in will typically be in sections. The ends of the sections (that aren't at the brake or lever) will generally have a sort of metal cap that fits into some kind of stop. The stops on my bike are sort of little cup shaped things with a hole for the cable and a slot along one side to allow the cable to be run into it in the first place. I've only ever had it happen when I forgot to reattach the brake after fixing a flat. When the cable has too much slack it's easy for either of those problems to happen. Once you get everything working again, check how much slack the cable has. It shouldn't be common if everything is adjusted right. If it's really become disconnected inside the brake lever, how to reconnect the end without untaping and retaping your bars will depend on exactly how the cable is connected inside the lever. On mine I think if I released the tension elsewhere on the cable it would be possible to pull the cable end into the place it should be in (but it would be a fiddly sort of operation working in a cramped little space). 

Slightly smaller is fine There's really no possible problems going just a wee bit smaller. Even going much smaller would probably be fine. Slightly larger is probably ok With the original 26 x 2.0 tires on the bike, check the clearances. Remember that a 2.1 tire will be both wider and "taller". Look at how much space there is around the tire at the fork crown, where the tire is close to the downtube, where the tire passes between the seat stays, where the tire passes between the chainstays, where the tire gets closest to the seat tube... As long as there's room for a wider tire, it'll be fine. It's really common to change out tires for slightly different sized ones. 

Your rim diameter is 622mm. Same as most road bikes, most cyclocross bikes, many touring bikes, many hybrids, and some cruisers. Figure out your rim width in millimeters. It might be printed on the wheel somewhere, it might be in the specs for your bike, and you might have to borrow some calipers to figure it out. You're looking for the inner rim width that fits outside the beads. You should now have figured out the ISO size of your rims. Work out what the acceptable tire widths. Something like Sheldon Brown's tire width to rim width chart should help. Look for tires within the range you've worked out. I suspect 45-622 will be your smallest acceptable size and 60-622 is probably a tiny bit bigger than your current tire. If you go a bit smaller (35-38mm), you'll be risking pinch flats and rim damage, but there's a lot more tires available. 

Does it make the noise with no weight on it? Can you hold up the front of the bike and listen? Figuring out exactly where the noise is coming from would be very helpful. If you hold the handlebars or fork steady and try to move the wheel sideways, is there any play (does it wiggle or is it solid)? The wheel should spin freely Look at one of the brake pads (or something else that's close to the wheel) and spin it; can you see the wheel move side to side as it spins? Wiggle the spokes. Do they all feel the same, or do some feel looser than others? If there's anything optional, like fenders and you still haven't found the source of the noise, try removing those and see if the noise goes away. 

From your comments, it sounds like you're hoping to find a folding bike that folds up fast, but is also light enough to carry up stairs easily and small enough to fit through turnstiles and on the train with no problems. All for well under $1000. This may be impossible. There are cheap folding bikes (under $500) and there are lightweight ones that fold up small and easy to walk around with. You might be able to find something that meets all those criteria for cheap that's used, but I don't think you can manage that with a new bike. There is the A-Bike which is quite similar looking, but has a different folding mechanism. There's plenty of competition for folding bikes out there: 

It certainly sounds like you should look at going to a wider range of gears. Your triple on the front already seems like a pretty wide range, and unlikely to easily get a wider range up there, so I'm thinking you'd mostly be looking at a wider range on the cassette. The downside of widening your gear range will (generally) be that you'd get less fine tuning of gears inside your range. You should definitely pay attention to the actual gear ratios. Some careful selection (work out all your current gears and figure out what the new gears would be) could help a lot. Right now your low end is basically 1:1 and your high end is 4.1:1. A smallest sprocket of 11 instead of 13 (without changing from a 53) would get you to 4.8:1 for your highest gear, which is about an 18% improvement and could easily be enough to get you the higher-end range it sounds like you need. Much more low end than that might require replacing the rear derailer, but I've seen 11-34, etc, which would get your lowest gear down to 0.8:1. Usually those have a specific "granny" gear on the back that's a big jump, which could still leave you with plenty of fine tuning in the rest of your gear range. 

I really want to ride the Lotoja, from Logan, Utah to Jackson, Wyoming (206 miles). There's some beautiful scenery along that route (I've driven it several times) and enough up and down to make it really challenging. I also really want to ride the Salt to Saint, from Salt Lake City, Utah to St. George, Utah. Since it goes through my hometown and all... Also, some beautiful views along the route. 

It's common etiquette, at least everywhere I've been, to stay away from wet and muddy trails (unless they're supposed to be or always are a mudfest). Riding on a muddy trail makes ruts which make the trail conditions worse for everyone once the mud dries and the ground hardens. In addition to ruts, if the trail is muddy and you slide out a front wheel going around a turn, for example, your wheel can scrape several inches of trail off. This can cause erosion problems later on. However, as alluded to earlier, if the trail is a known mudbog and stays muddy year-round, one more rut probably won't hurt anything. Another common counterexample is when the trail is melting in the afternoons but can be ridden early in the day when the ground is frozen. If you're crazy enough to be out riding then, more power to you. But generally speaking, it is in good taste to stay off melting, muddy trails. Any time your presence can alter the trail physically (ruts, slide-offs, feature damage), everyone else who shares the trail with you will be glad you stayed off. 

In small neighborhoods like this it's also not a bad idea to stay out in the lane and not hug the curb. This gives you much more time if a car or child comes hurtling out into the road and you're not going to be slowing down a following car very much. Edit: include the warning to watch for dogs. This is pretty important. 

I've never ridden a belt-drive bicycle, but I've ridden both belt and chain drive motorcycles and the belt drive is considerably smoother and quieter. One of the features being used to tout belt-driven bikes is that they don't require lubing, so that would be a plus. In addition to not needing to take the time to properly lube your drive-train, the lack of lube would mean less attractant for dirt/dust etc. Each manufacturer would probably have their own recommendations about operating temperature range and how often to change them. 

If it's not broken, don't fix it. The act of folding ourselves onto a bicycle, (especially one with any kind of aerodynamic advantage over a mountain bike) is not a natural-looking position for a human body. We're built to be more or less upright, which is not an aerodynamic position on the bike. So, if you're comfortable on your bike and feel like you're ok with the amount of wind-resistance you create for yourself, and your bike is properly sized for you, there's not much you'd really want to change. A couple of general bike position loose guidelines (yes, general and loose are a bit redundant here, but these are not hard fast rules): 

If all these things hold more or less true, and you're comfortable when you ride, don't stress what you look like. 

It will probably depend on terrain, speed, and other aerodynamic (or lack thereof) factors whether one would even notice a difference between an "aero" frame or a "normal" frame. If you're climbing lots of hills, riding in traffic, or otherwise not in a position where wind resistance is your chief enemy, I doubt you'd see a benefit from going aero. If you live out in the farmlands and ride on fast, flat roads, or somewhere that has lots of wind, you may notice a difference, because wind/air resistance becomes a factor. 

My fixed gear bike has brakes. And I wear a helmet when riding it. And I don't listen to my iPod while on the bike. I'm the new non-conformist. 

I find Clif Bars to be a pretty good solution. They're easy to open, they go down relatively easily, they don't melt or freeze (ever try eating a powerbar on a cold day?) and they have about 200+ calories. On rides shorter than 3 hours, I just take a couple of packets of Gu, one bottle of water, and one bottle of lightly-mixed gatorade (I mix from powder since the full-strength stuff leaves the mouth quite sticky on a ride). On longer outings, I'll take the Gu and a Clif Bar per 2 hours, and lots more water. 

Don't expect much until you know the guys that work at a bike shop. I bought my first road bike (a single speed) from my not-so-local LBS because it was on sale (45 miles from my house, with several bike shops in between). In the process, I discovered that I got along well with the guys that work there. In return for our growing relationship, they started giving me pointers about maintenance, and discounts on accessories (computer, bar tape, etc). When I referred my father-in-law to them to get a bike (he's a doctor and doesn't have the same price constraints that I do) they gave him a pretty good deal because I sent him. I have no doubt that when I've saved my pennies enough to budget for a new bike I'll get as good a deal as they can offer me, without having to ask for a deal. Most bike shop employees and owners could make a lot more money doing something else, but own/work at a bike shop because they love cycling. I appreciated the desire to stretch your dollars as far as they'll go, but nobody is entitled to special deals without earning them.
