Rebirth is the one of the main reasons to practice Buddhism otherwise you are just following nihilism, just kill yourself and its done. It will not match the concept of dependent origination or the middle way. Its no included in the agreements of the Theravada and Mahayana because it is not part of practice and also assumed knowledge, if you go to a Buddhist country and ask a Buddhist about rebirth they will undoubtedly believe it but they might not know the four noble truth. In the same way both schools recognize there are Gods,Asuras, Animals, Hells why not add it too? 

I remember reading a sutra where someone asked the Buddha something similar to this and he replied (in a paraphrased way) "Did you desire to come here before arriving here?" Buddha "Yes" Someone "Now you are here do you still desire or are attached with coming here" Buddha "No" That Guy "It is the same with Nirvana/Practice, when you are there you can let it go" There is nothing wrong with it Master Zhi Yi classifies desire for practice/achievement as one of the helpful qualities to Cultivation/Meditation 

In the Diamond Sutra the Buddhas says “All conditioned things are like dreams, illusions, bubbles, shadows they are like dew or lightning this is how they are to be viewed" This is since all phenomena like the world are impermanent and therefore subject to an end like an illusion 

Its not really not trying to change anything. This probably stems from a bad interpretation of Zen/Chan Buddhism where one practice is to observe the mind. Thoughts that come whether good or bad will arise then pass so you can observe them realizing they are impermanent, non-self, etc or simply observe them without attaching to them. A Chan master taught a series of five techniques of increasing subtlety. All are misguided in some way apart from the fifth and ultimate method. 

In the realms of heaven, you are "burning up" large quantities of "positive" karma quickly There is little reason to generate "positive" karma while in the heaven realms, why? Because you are in some state of bliss Once you burn all that "good" karma all that is left in your "stash" is "bad" karma. 

Other than these areas I could find no references to balancing the 37 factors. Hopefully this is what you are looking for... 

Instead of viewing every car as an obstacle try to shift your mind to see each as sentient being(s), just like you, with the same goal as you, to reach their destination safely. If your anger stems from being in a rush or late, try to leave earlier to give more time to reach your destination. Driving with the radio off and with your focus on the road, your car, and other cars is actually safer in many regards. If a driver does something that arouses anger in your being, ask yourself, 

It is worth noting, in conjunction with the other answers provided, that the fetus in question is going through karma from it's past lives in a scenario like this. 

When anger swells up and rears its head I wish to be rid of it quickly. For a moment of anger is said to burn a mountain of merit. In my personal practice I have gotten quite adapt at controlling my negative emotions and dealing with them appropriately. Patience is something I used to not know at all. Now I know patience well, and am able to keep my cool when things go sour. Lately though, even though I keep my cool, I can feel anger inside myself. It is not controlling my actions, but it is present, and I can feel it in my pulse, and in my body temperature when I breathe. I'd like to know if there are any practices related to this sort of anger. One that is not outwardly visible, but is present nonetheless. 

A direct awareness of the arising of deluded thoughts. An examination of that awareness. The prevention of the arising of thoughts. The perception that thoughts have no intrinsic nature (that is, they are empty). Awareness of the arising of deluded thoughts without analysing or pursuing this awareness, so that thoughts are freed the instant they arise. 

Some Chan Teachings: Therefore you should not suppress concepts. Whenever they arise, if you do not fabricate anything but instead let them go, then they will stay as they are and come to rest by themselves; thus you will not pursue them. Some Chan teachings: When you are engaged in contemplation itself, look at your own mind. Then, the lack of any mental activity at all is non-thought. If there is movement of the conceptual mind, be aware of it. “How should one be aware?” Do not analyse the mind which is moving in terms of any kind of quality at all: do not analyse it as moving or not moving; do not analyse it as existing or not existing; do not analyse it as virtuous or non-virtuous; and do not analyse it as defiled or pure. If you are aware of mind in this way, it is natureless. This is the practice of the dharma path. 

It depends, there are three realms Desire, Form, Formless. Desire realm gods as the name suggests have desires and are more likely to be attached to their luxuries making it hard to study the Dharma. However, Form and Formless realm gods all attained their positions from high skill in meditation and are far less attached to desire and they probably don't find too much harder than us in following Buddhism 

How would hell be completely existent in every school of Buddhism if it was a tool added to control society? If something was added not everyone would accept it resulting in various schools as we see now but this hasn't occurred with Hell so it isn't a later addition. 

This last branch vow is an interesting one, one skillful means described by my old guru back when I was practicing the vows and still considered myself Buddhist was the act of reprimanding with false anger. To appear angry and scold when you actual are not holding anger and are holding compassion for the one being scolded. If someone was a guru or a monk and they were telling people to kill 3rd born children (A highly unlikely case) It is permissible to break certain vows to stop them and their followers. See 

These are all metaphors for impermanent things. Phantom is a ghost. You can find the full text in Tibetan and English here An audio lecture (four parts) can be found here (On the main page click dharma essentials, and then course 6 for the links to parts 3 - 4) Some written notes on the audio lecture here. 

Now, this can be seen in the Tibetian Wheel of Life Illustration, but I do not have the memory or resources to know if any sutras flat out say it. I think it is worth noting that the drop from heaven to hell is not guaranteed by even this belief, as it is in accordance with the "individuals" karma. However in most cases after a birth in heaven, the next rebirth will tend to be in the lower realms, either animal, hungry ghost, or hell being. 

These mantras are normally chanted in meditation , there is some controversy over the subject in Western Rime centers, but it is absolutely a part of the Tibetan Tradition. 

No escape through any gate, those overcome by fear that try to flee are captured by goddesses accompanying the gate keepers (Various ways are described) Those trying to escape through the gates are stopped by the gate keepers, those attempting to kill themselves to escape are revived by Amrtakundali. 

I was reading through Patisambhidamagga, KN. From page 164, it describes about 'Eighteen kinds of knowledge of imperfections' related to Anapanasati(Mahavagga->Anapanasatikatha). Following is the except: 

Does anybody have a reference to pali canon(not commentary) where it supports the observation of start-middle-end of breath? 

In short, modern scientists analyze the external universe from quarks to quasars in pursuit of "the ultimate reality". On the contrary, we Buddhists analyze the matter in our sense experience as patavi, apo, thejo, wayo - Mahābhūta to get rid of the dilution (avijja) caused by Vijñāna(~consciousness) projected on Mahābhūta. This is the intention of kayanupassana as described in the great Satipattana Sutta. 

Anxiety is caused mainly by Uddhacca-kukkucca. And it can be abandoned by developing tranquility, concentration and equanimity of the mind. 

In short, 'world' is relative to one's six sense experience. And six sense(Salayathana) bases are made out of past karma(cause) and the experience based on those senses are vipaka(effect). So the 31 planes of existence is nothing but 31 levels of sense base experiences. This is can be further explained if we analyze the availability of senses in Kama Loka, Rupa Loka and Arupa Loka: 

With or without intention, volitional actions are defined as kamma. For example, killing an animal in excruciating pain while the intention was to free it from agony. Even in habitual or involuntary actions, there might be an element of intention. It is just the lack of awareness or mindfulness. For example; one could slap a mosquito involuntarily; but the thought process required to kill is complete, hence bad kamma is accumulated. 

According to Dhammachakka sutta, the first sermon of Buddha, four noble truths are explained in the following sequence: 

The Buddha clearly rebuked the idea of consciousness/mind that runs and wanders on [from birth to birth] in Mahatanhasankhaya Sutta (MN 38). 

An audio class on it can be found here. Typed notes of this audio lecture can be found here A useful chart can be found here. It is in the reading as well, but in a less readable format. The Tibetans believed that the purification of karma was possible. The Karmic Purification process has 4 steps. There is a class on that too on the same site. (acidharma.org) I will provide a brief summary of the process. The first step is to take refuge in the 3 jewels, in your knowledge of karma and emptiness. I will not go to into depth on this step. The second step is called "Destruction Force" 

In most traditions of Buddhism there is talk of the Buddha, or various Bodhisattvas talking about their past lives. At what point in the path to enlightenment is the ability to remember ones past lives gained? 

The proper way to address this is also highly situational. Keep in mind some of the other bodhisattva vows that must be kept in tandem, especially 

There is disagreement on this between schools, in the Tibetan tradition merit cannot be transferred to others, but can be offered / dedicated to achieving virtuous goals : IE dedicating all my merit to the goal of freeing all beings from suffering. This however is borderline transferring... so it is unclear where the line is drawn. 

These descriptions, as noted in the article, are designed to give the reader a general feel of the process. To use your metaphor 

This is situational as well. Is it a video of something we have no control over? If so the answer is no. Is our job to stop crime, or does the video give you some knowledge that could stop the criminal etc. and you choose (Through apathy or other reasons) to ignore it, then the answer is yes. However if it is a youtube fail compilation video, or just a compilation of random crimes, that have nothing to do with you, or your community, ignoring it, would be the best option. By that I mean, not seeking more out to watch as well.
