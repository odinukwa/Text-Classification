I also think that people tend to look only at those better off (in whatever way they want to be well off) when judging themselves, not at a total population. So in a group of 10, 9 people are going to feel that everyone in the group is better off than them, as they only compare themselves with the ones that are. Even worse, for subjective things, all 10 may feel worse off, as unfavourable comparisons can go both ways. (A feels uglier than B, and B feels uglier than A, for example). I don't have a name for this, or a source, it's an opinion founded purely on experiences. 

Something to add to pluke's answer: The "scientific method" is to only believe what you can prove (and to actively try to disprove any hypothesis). So although you can't disprove that God exists, if you can't prove it, it is more in line with that principle to disbelieve it than to believe it. So I agree 100% that God can neither be proven to exist, or not to exist, but to apply Occam's razor and believe the simpler -and closer to physical proofs that DO exist- theories, the more scientific we are being. 

"If A Then B" implies nothing about the world if A is false. So the statement can't be disproved if A is false. Technically, I suppose it's more "undefined" than "True" when A is false - but truth tables don't usually allow for an undefined value. 

While I think there are some concepts that can't necessarily be described properly in every language, I think your reasoning is flawed. When we learn what a "dog" is, we don't have to say "It's a four-legged mammal with these characteristics..." - we say "That." - and point at one. When words are labels for things in the real world, it doesn't necessarily follow that there has to be a word (or words) to describe it, and it certainly doesn't follow that no other words can be re-used in any of those definitions in order to form the tree-like definition structure you describe that leads to one root word. 

I don't believe that "It is the case that X" is different from "X is true". As far as defining it, I'd say the closest synonym I can think of is "a fact" - as in "It is a fact that X". In more general use however, there can be several, contradictory "cases" being discussed, whereas a "fact" is more a constant (given, assumed, or proven) across all "cases". (scenarios? possibilities?) Example sentence: x -> y y While it is a fact that y is true, there are two cases to consider, the case where x is true, and the case where x is false. 

The statement "The King of France is bald" would usually mean "The King Of France exists, and has no hair". It could be taken to mean a few other things, but this is the meaning I will assume for this answer, and regardless of what you assume it to mean, you can use the same method I will use below to derive the opposite. Let X = The King of France Let A = X exists Let B = X has no hair Truth Table:      BT     BF AT    . AF The dot in that truth table represents the situation "The King of France is Bald". The opposite would be      BT     BF AT           . AF    .      . Which is (A&!B) or (!A&B) or (!A&!B) which simplifies to (!A or (A&!B)) It can also simplify to (!B or (!A&B)) which in english is "The King of France does not exist, or he exists and has hair" or "The King of France has hair, or he does not exist and has hair". As the second translation doesn't really make sense, we take the first. (As, in this case, the second sentence only has a value if the first is true). If you interpret the original sentence to be a different combination of facts, or some dependency between the two sentences, then your original truth table is different, but to find the opposite, you take the truth table with every combination being opposite, and interpret from there. Another popular interpretation would be "There exists a King of France such that it is bald." The opposite of that one is "There does not exist a King of France such that it is bald," which is quite clearly true. 

I'm surprised that nobody mentions the "artistic sports". In gymnastics, high-diving, synchronised swimming, etc, points are scored purely on an "expert's" aesthetic aproval of your performance. I don't think anyone would argue that these are sports (except maybe synchronised swimming!) - but they are definitely art forms, and the scoring of them is certainly not entirely objective. You can't "win ugly" in these sports. However, teams and individuals compete against each other with the intention of winning, by scoring more points than their competitors, exactly as in the general definition of "sport" (and the context you supply above). So in these cases I think the answer is absolute - these are sports, and also art forms, in and of themselves. 

The answer to your question is "No", nobody has proposed such a number. Because an infinite number of them exist. 0.1 is an example, so is 0.01, 0.2, etc etc etc. As soon as you limit your "i" number to being a positive integer (and hence being relevant to the definition of prime), it becomes impossible, as there are a finite number of integers between 1 and 7, and all of them can be proven to not divide into 7. Anything bigger than 7 will obviously not divide into 7 with an integer result. Anything less than 1 is not a positive integer. So although there are numbers that divide evenly (ie with an integer result) into 7, none of them (besides 1 and 7) are positive integers, and that's what it takes to make 7 prime. When first conceiving "i" as a concept, it is important to realise that it is NOT part of the number systems you already know. Much like a child learning about fractions for the first time, or negative numbers, these are outside of the systems they have learned so far. It is possible to have a "new" concept that fits a definition that is currently impossible, but you cannot try to infer that it fits in an existing set of numbers (positive integers), and hence breaks an existing rule (prime). 

Also read sometimes as: p implies q. All this means is that p being true defines a value for q. When p is false, q can be anything it likes. The "True" (not undefined or not known) in the truth table means that these values do not contradict the rules, which is true in this case. It is more that the RULE is (can be) true when p and q have these values, than saying that the rule proves these values, which is how you seem to be trying to read it. 

Absolutely. There's a principle called "Protection of the minority" respected by most Democratic systems, that exists to do exactly that. It's the reason most countries have a constitution, and why there's a "bill of Human Rights" respected in most places. Essentially, this principle exists to ensure that the majority can't vote to further their own causes at the expense of a minority (For example, if we were to vote that all people whose last name started with a letter after "S" in the alphabet had to give all their money to people whose name started with a letter before "S", more people would (ignoring morals) want to vote for it than against, but the protection of the minority would kick in here, through a consitutionally protected right to property, for example). 

I'm not sure that this does "imply an infinite amount of knowledge". Infinite recursion does not necessarily result in an infinite total. 1+1/2+1/4+1/8+1/16+... to an infinite level of recursion still results in just less than 2, not infinity. In relation to your question, each "piece" of knowledge seems "smaller" (less meaningful, less relevant?) than the previous one, and sufficiently so that the sum of all those pieces is not significantly "larger" than the first few terms. In practice, there are many environments where we communicate information and don't require confirmation. There are still relatively many where we require confirmation, but very few that I can think of where the communication isn't considered complete until we've confirmed receipt of the confirmation. If these pieces of information were "equal", there would be many more situations where there was significant recursion of confirmations. 

I may be missing something here, but I assume we are using "reductio ad absurdum" proof principles here. If so, as I understand it, we assume the opposite of the thing we are trying to prove - instead of the original hypothesis. In your proof, you have conclusions drawn from both the original (3 from 1) and the opposite assumption (4 from 2) - which is always (and obviously, if you think about it a little) going to give you contradictions. So assuming I have your question right, and understood your proof right, no, it's not valid. The contradiction has to come from assuming ONLY the opposite, not both the original and the opposite. If I have understood wrong, please explain why, and I'll try to clarify. 

You have proven that the argument did not come from a thing - not that it came from nothing. The other alternative reading of "did not come from a thing" is that it has always existed (which as you are making it the set of all things ever, is the more reasonable reading) Sorry for the brief answer, late for work! 

"Ethical" is a very subjective subject, most of the time*. But in general, I would say it's unethical not to use the best information available when treating someone (talking medical ethics here, as per your example) regardless of how that information was gained. If the first experiment with cyanide was to poison someone with it, and only then realize that it's lethal, should everyone else ignore that information and continue to give it to patients? Of course, there's a fine line between "using information gathered unethically" and "indirectly funding/encouraging the unethical gathering of information". It's important not to cross that line. 

I work in a quite technical field, that my wife knows nothing about. When I am trying to explain something that happened at work that day that involves something technical, there's two ways I can approach it: 1) I can try to explain to her the basics around what happened, which I will do when it is fairly simple or close to something I can easily analogise. 2) I can give her some absolutes to work from that explain the situation I am in without imparting an understanding of the underlying tech. When I do 1) she understands the issues, and hence believes the conclusions that I lead her to. When I do 2) she agrees to just "take it on faith" because she trusts my knowledge of the area. "Taking it on faith" is very different from "believing" it (as we are using the terms here), even if religion has merged the two to mean the same for its own purposes. I guess I do the same when reading about quantum physics break-throughs and similar. There's a lot I need to accept without understanding to understand the stories. When I later learn enough to fill the gaps, I gain belief. 

Allow me to play around a little with the situation you have proposed. We walk into a room with 5 individuals, and ask them one at a time: "Are you American?" We may assume (of the people in the room): 1) "Not all are American" as soon as we get a "No" Answer. 2) "Some are American" as soon as we get a "Yes" Answer. The real difference comes in the "Some are Not American" situation. We can only assume this when we get a "No" answer, just like "Not all are American". However, if a random number of people are now removed from the room, Americans first, we can assume "Not all are American" as long as we had a "No" answer originally. We can NOT assume "Some are not American" unless we know that someone is left in the room. A more silly, but more straightforward set of hypotheses: 1) Not all Americans are Martians. 2) Some Americans are not Martians. 3) Not all Martians are Americans. 4) Some Martians are not Americans. 1, 2, 3 are all true, but 4 is false, as we are proposing an existing member of an empty set. Hope that helps! 

As somebody pointed out above - Circles exist regardless of observers, and the ratio between any circle and its radius is constant. For that matter, the ratio between the distances between the center of a sphere and any point on its surface is constant too (1), so these "values" must exist as well, independant of thought about them. In fact, a sphere is defined as a shape where every point on the surface is equi-distant from the center. If numbers don't exist, then that concept can't exist either... I hear the arguments against the independant existence of numbers, but I cannot wrap my head around their non-existence, where I can easily understand other such arguments. I find it easier to understand the concept of something concrete ("a tree" for example) not existing than numbers not existing. I tend to trust my understanding in issues like this, if something feels like its bordering on the nonsensical like this does, I cannot accept it as true. I welcome an explanation of a number-less world that I can wrap my head around - I just haven't heard one yet... 

I believe that the laws of mathematics are independant of thought. The names, symbols, etc that we assign to numbers are irrelevant, but the ratio between the radius and circumference of a circle, for example, are constant whether we observe them or not. The laws of physics, equally, are part of the universe, regardless of human observation. We spend time and effort trying to figure out what they are, not inventing them. I would like to believe, also, that the laws of logic are similarly imutable. The way we express them make it feel like they are human inventions, but I believe they are constant facts of reality that we discover and decide on conventions to express, rather than creating and enforcing rules on reality. We would not observe water flowing uphill (observe, not just perceive), or 1 individual object coming together with another and forming a group of 3. However, when it comes to logic, it is possible to perceive actions which seem to be founded on a belief that defies logic, making it easier to think that it is human-created. 

Existential - There exists x such that... (says something about some x) Universal - All x are... (says something about every instance of x) Yes, as with so many things in logic, adding a "Not" can change that (idiomatically) as ~(∃x)Fx is the same as (x)~Fx, and does specify something about all x, not just some of them, but as far as I'm aware this is still an "Existential" statement. Willing to be corrected on that last point, but as far as I'm aware, as long as you are talking about (∃x), it's Existential. 

I'd like to add a shorter version of distinguishing "paradox" from "tautology". In short, they are closer to being opposites than synonyms. A Paradox is a situation that cannot exist sensibly, eg: "This statement is false". Attempting to evaluate the truth of that statement is impossible, as truth forces it to be false, and falsehood forces it to be true. Time-travel stories love paradox. The important aspect of a paradox is that it cannot be meaningfuly evaluated, not that it proves itself false. Also, paradoxes are almost always self-referential, in order to have that quality. Tautology is a statement that proves its own truth. The examples given above (eg "All unmarried men are bachelors") are perfectly good ones. In general use, a tautology is a repetitive statement of the same fact (as opposed to a redundancy, which is stating a fact, and one that can be implied by it). eg "The black cat is black" is a tautology. "The black cat is not white" is technically a redundancy, although one that trivial feels like a tautology. (Note, that definition is more about language than logic, included here for completeness) x->x is a tautology. x->~x is not a paradox, it is just false.
