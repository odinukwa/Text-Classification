It's a characteristic of things, not a thing. Things are impermanent. Impermanence is not necessarily impermanent (because impermanence is not a thing). 

I think it's sloppy speech about the word "infinity". Your statement is a "divide by zero" error, undefined, meaningless. I learned in Maths that the correct way to use "infinity" is that it isn't a number, it's a limit ... or more specifically it's no limit, it's unbounded. The definition of "infinity" is "bigger than any number": for example if you pick any number (e.g. "100") I can find another number bigger than your number (e.g. "101"), therefore the number you picked isn't "infinity" ... no number that you can pick is "infinite". The correct way to phrase your ashtray problem is something like, 

The OP asked, "In particular if such a person were to heed the advice of the Kalama Sutra". So, the same Kalama Sutta also tells the following reasons, for which the Kalamas should believe a given doctrine: 

What I'm positing is: if a foetus counts as life, then the same rules apply as with any other life. If a foetus doesn't yet count as life, then no such rules apply. That seems simplistic. If you're asking whether the argument is only about "when does life begin?" I think the answer to that is "no" as well. 

I was amused by the opinion on that subject which was quoted to me by my dad (he was a Roman Historian, and the following is from a fictional description): 

I think it has been useful in advancing technology. Your "science hasn't given a proof of the existence of God" might be summarized as Occam's razor and Russell's teapot. However IMO personal faith is useful too. For example, one reason why you're able to learn chemistry at school might be because you personally have faith in your chemistry teacher: faith that they're talking sense, saying something that's worth learning, and that even if you don't understand them immediately there is something to be understood which you expect to understand later. Personal faith (e.g. in the safety of the airplane or in your own unimportance) is also useful when getting on an airplane for example. 

In the first situation she knows the name by remembering it. A person's name cannot be calculated, only memorized. In the second situation she knows the result by calculating it. She has memorized (i.e. knows) how to multiply, how to calculate a result, but does not know what the result is until after doing the calculation. The premise (that #1 is "know" and #2 is "not know") is true if "I know" is a synonym for "I have memorized" (but not a synonym for, "I am able to calculate"). Sometimes we can, colloquially, say that #2 is an example of "knowing the product of two numbers": we might say that the subject is "numerate" or "knows her numbers", or (more formally) "knows multiplication". 

There are several reasons why it's about choice. Rhetoric/politics It's more attractive to be "pro" something than "anti" something. For example, if your opponent's position is "pro life", you don't want yours to be called "anti life", you want to be called "pro" choice (and vice versa). Rights trump choice Your choices end where my rights begin. People use the alleged "baby's right to life" as a tool to limit or eliminate the pregnant woman's choice. To counter-act that "right", people talk about the "right to choose" etc. Life begins whenever we say it does There are different times when life could be said to begin: 

The division of the world into separate "things" seems obvious, but may not withstand certain types (e.g. time-scales) of scrutiny. Consider your body, for example: it sheds skin flakes; you eat and breathe; where does your body begin, and where does it end? Is it the same thing tomorrow, as yesterday? In what sense is it a thing that's objectively separate from other things? 

Or, if you kept the "a fetus is a human" definition, then the argument might break at this statement: 

Furthermore there is a social good, a social justification for a law which says, "It's usually illegal for citizens to kill other (living) people (in society)." It's not at all clear to me that it's equally good or necessary to have the same law about terminating pregnancy. So even I grant your premise that "it's about life" I'd say that "it's more about killing", but abortion isn't killing because there is no "person" involved (assuming for example that person-hood begins when you qualify for a birth certificate). And it's only "usually" illegal to kill: for example the law makes exceptions for accidents, for self-defence, for not being a sufficiently "good Samaritan", and I don't know what else. In fact that's probably why there are extra/specific laws, which govern abortion: because otherwise abortion would not be covered by other/existing laws which regulate unlawful killing. 

Buddhism teaches that impermanence (analogous to "change") is a characteristic of any/all "component things" or "compound things" i.e. of things which have been put together: which are also called "conditioned phenomena" because their existence depends on or is conditioned by other things. Among "impermanent phenomena" are Saṅkhāra: which includes things imagined and things desired. But impermanence/change itself is not a "compound thing". 

So the argument is about when does life begin. Granted that there's a "right to life" after birth, and granted that there is a "right to choose" before life begins, the question is "when does the right to choose end and the right to life begin?" Difficult choices Sometimes there are difficult choices, e.g. when the pregnancy threatens the mother's life, or if it's determined that if the feturs is carried to term then the baby will be born disabled, etc. 

Some people prefer science over religion because they reckon science is more beneficial: it not only "works", but has practical beneficial consequences like modern medicine. It's also practical in the sense that "it can be practised". 

I suspect that there's a problem caused by using an adjective as a noun. The word "human" can be used as an adjective or a noun. It can be used as an adjective, e.g.: 

I think it's to do with relativism. If you only know X and Y, and know that Y is worse than X, then you have the situation described in the OP. To know that X is bad, either you need to know about some "absolute" good (against which to compare X and find it bad), rather than mere "relative" good; or at least you need to know a third thing, Z, which is relatively good and compared to which X is bad. In if you want to support your proposition that X is bad, in spite of your interlocutor's reminder that Y is worse, either you need to define what "absolute" good is or you need to explain what third choice you're comparing X with. In your "homeopathy & chiropractics" example, you could argue: 

... which I understand as meaning that people deify (e.g. describe as "God") what they imagine to be greater than themselves. Some people also speak of a God of the gaps, which I think means we attribute to "God" whatever is a gap in our knowledge. 

I think that Buddhism teaches that it's self-evident that "suffering" exists. "Suffering" is a poor translation of Dukkha. This is an important observation: it's the so-called First Noble Truth. One you accept there's such a thing as a "self" and that you're "sentient" then your object may be to minimize or to end (i.e. to prevent the arising of) suffering. Presumably you don't believe that "bullet in head" is a skillful way to prevent the arising of suffering, nor to 'live a good life'. Buddhism also constructs an ethical system of virtues and faults: faults like greed and anger, and violence (which cause suffering); and virtues like equanimity and loving-kindness, and harmlessness (which prevent suffering). And it does this without believing in a God (well, more specifically without a God you'd recognize as such). 

I suspect that enthusiasm might be neither ethical nor unethical (though some might argue that it's better to be individualist, conversely others argue that's it's better to be socialist). Instead perhaps it's the consequence of the enthusiasm, i.e. what you do with it or as a consequence of it, that's ethical or not; for example: 

Do you mean "prove to yourself" or "prove to others"? The question arises e.g. with the Theory of Evolution: "If the earth is really only 6000 years old, then when were the dinosaur fossils created?" etc. Some of the "laws" are better-proven than others. The law of gravity, for example: if I drop a hammer on my foot, I can entertain the thought that perhaps it will float like a feather in the air instead of dropping, BUT I am what I call "virtually certain" that it would drop and hurt and therefore I won't try it. I suppose I'm used to the notion that I might be wrong. I like to think that I'm "biased" but not "prejudiced" i.e. that if NASA would demonstrate an anti-gravity device then my bias would say "that's highly unlikely to be true" but I wouldn't have prejudice saying "that's impossible". So maybe I use fuzzy instead of boolean logic: the probability of the hammer hurting my foot if I drop it is ninety nine point nines percent, not a hundred. Still that's close enough to a hundred that I won't make the experiment. Note that criminal law has to cope with this kind of problem too, so apparently it uses notions like "evidence" and "beyond reasonable doubt". 

I'm not sure, I'd guess that a Buddhist might say that lions are evil -- they're killers, and immoral. Animals in general exist in an inferior state of being, i.e. the (lower) animal state is closer to the (lowest) hell state than the (higher) human state is, because animals don't have the capacity for morality (I'm not sure whether one distinguishes between amoral and immoral). I suppose there are three reasons to think that they're not evil: 

Perhaps you might be on thin ice, though, if you're getting in to a "religion versus science" argument? There was this 'joke' I heard once, while I was living in Toronto: 

What does the phrase have to do with the Greeks? And the Greeks had "Nothing in excess" as a proverb. 

Buddhism originated at about the same time as ancient Greek philosophers (e.g. Plato from about 425 - 348 BCE, whereas Gautama Buddha sometime between the sixth and fourth centuries BCE), is 'philosophy' and a 'modern way of thinking which stems back to ancient times', yet doesn't originate in Greece. 

For what it's worth, to the extent that it's true, the phrase reminds me of the "Middle Way" of Buddhism; i.e. that you might (as the Gautama Buddha himself did, with his early life as a worldly prince followed by his striving for enlightenment as an ascetic) know extreme (excess) before you know wisdom (sufficiency); e.g. you know "not enough" and "too much" (excess) before you understand "enough". 

I don't know much about Western philosophy (perhaps I came to this site with the same question that you did, which is how I found your unanswered question here). I think that maybe Stoicism has some obvious paralells with Buddhism. One disadvantage, perhaps, is that there isn't much surviving literature from the early stoics (compared to e.g. the whole bookshelf, the whole library, of Buddhist literature), though there's more from some of the later stoics like Marcus Aurelius (I'm not sure whether Marcus Aurelius should be considered a good teacher though, or whether instead perhaps he was a good student). I looked at Wikipedia's Categories in the hopes of getting an overview or introduction or index. Within those categories: 

The title of the question is "are both achievable?" but by the end of the question you're asking whether they're mutually exclusive. Can you help and maintain (not 'instead of maintaining') your own happiness? Your question sounds a bit like, "My friend is drowning and I'm not very good at swimming; am I morally obliged to drown too?" A lifeguard is taught to save people without drowning themselves. That can't continue to help if they drown too! Professional counsellors and doctors too have a certain detachment as well as compassion. Can you remain close (helpful) without becoming 'attached'? Can you remain happy, or retain equanimity, or at least learn how to always regain your equanimity after whenever you lose it? Can you change the equation somehow: persuade your friends to swim for themselves, call a professional lifeguard for them, throw them a flotation aid, instead of simply drowning yourself?
