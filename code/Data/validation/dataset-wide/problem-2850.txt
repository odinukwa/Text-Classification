Is Epictetus implying there is only ever just one cause for our actions? Or, is Epictetus arguing there is one cause which outweighs all others? What is Epictetus saying this cause actually is? 

How reliable is a "Logic / Objectivity" Bias when it comes to reasoning? Or, What are the potential limitations or vulnerabilities of relying solely on these bases of reasoning? Note 1: "Objectivity" and "Logic" are sometimes used interchangeably. But, I am speaking to the strength of "Objectivity" - not Logic, nor symbolic logic. However, it seems that along with other forms of reasoning - people often proclaim a Objectivity Bias, rather than other standards of reasoning: tradition, science, empiricism [different from science], pathos, ethos, Logos, (in the "Intrinsic Pattern" sense of Heraclitus), equanimity, wisdom, divine revelation, etc. Note 2: Some of those standards may appear "objective" - but are they really? In view of time, exhaustive knowledge, etc? What are the limitations and vulnerabilities of "Objectivity" when it comes to validating reasoning? Examples: 

2. Answer - the Simplest, Consistent and Valid Definitions of "Truth" and "Falsity": Logic is a computational process, examining the validity of a context of reasoning to infer a conclusion that has a "Truth Value". So, "Truth" is to "Reasoning", as "PI" is to "Circles" - an inviolable constraint. "Truth" defined in Terms of Logic, (premises, conclusions and implications): 

I don't want to start going through agnosticism, as it isn't as relevant to this question, so I'll set this one aside. 

Edit: While looking at the answers a thought came into my mind - most of the answers say something like "you can't not do both, it'd be way less effective". If so, why there are so many physicists that don't study philosophy? Why, for example, are there no philosophy courses in the physics degree? Are they being ignorant of philosophy? Do they think physics is inherently enough? Or do they simply don't interact with philosophy to even know its necessity? 

Two of the biggest German Idealism movement, Schelling and Hegel, have a very similar line of thought. I was wondering a simple question (with probably a long and complex question) - what is the difference between Schelling's System of Transcendental Idealism and Hegel's Philosophy of Spirit(/Mind)? (in both systematic and theoretic perspectives) 

I must say this is a topic that's been bothering me for some time now, especially considering my confusion of current state of academic departments. Put simply, I understand while reading philosophy of nature (the older term, I think, of nowadays physics) that the study of nature of the world (i.e. cosmology, parts of metaphysics, etc) used to lie in the philosophy department. But nowadays it seems as though philosophy stopped studying such subjects (or at least most of it, as subjects such as philosophy of mind still exists), and now the department that studies them is mostly physics. Correct me if I'm wrong, but by that development, the conclusion to a student interested in (what used to be) "philosophy of nature", is that he should study physics, and not philosophy (perhaps some combination, but physics would be the dominant one). Is that conclusion the correct one? Note that this is purely practical question. [I had no idea which tag would fit, so edit if you have any suggestion.] 

3. Why we find pleasure in creat/ing/ed beings: We are in fact creating "beings" - of some sort, certainly not as complex as ourselves - yet. If we are examining "God", transcendent of this causal domain, of physicality, and time - then any "physical pleasure" we find could not be validly attributed to God too. So, necessarily - the list would have to be limited - somewhat - to apply between a "Life Giving Spirit" towards "Mankind" - in the same ways we might find pleasure in the beings we are creating, (to establish plausibility). Our greatest pleasures creating beings, are in those that are "like us" - at least seeming to take pleasure in the same experiences that we do, (literature, comics, movies, virtual reality, etc.). 

2. Addressing Confirmation Biases: 2.1. A Source for Creativity, Inspiration, Abductive Reasoning: Theism and Mysticism have incredibly expanded what we have thought possible / plausible, (this is abductive logic, not inductive nor deductive). For example: We aren't living in the Dark Ages any more, and we know the plausibility of gods is certain - especially given: we are already creating artificial worlds, intelligences, toying with nano-technology, quantum mechanics, biological engineering, terra-forming, etc. 

A [Exists] A > B [is True] A [Exists] Therefore "B [is True]" "B [is True]" does not necessarily mean "B [Exists]". 

While this question sounds like this one, bear with me and I'll explain why it's more of a revised version of this one instead (and to be honest I wasn't sure if I should've just edited it, but I think it'll need a complete rewrite and would be better off to just post a new one instead). So, when people ask the question "is there something rather than nothing" (which some would claim to be "the root of philosophy") it seems like they assume that "nothing" is the 'default' status, while "something" would require an explanation - and an extensive question on this would be Does a negative claimant have a burden of proof? Now, what I'm asking is, why - on the epistemological level - would we ask the question that way (putting "nothing" on the root of it) rather than, for example "why would there be nothing rather than something"? Why do we assume that nothing comes first and something has to "fill the void"? In other words (those in my original question) - isn't "nothing" and "something" equivalent on the epistemological level? (maybe Spinoza on God would be a good example, although I'm not exactly sure how much of this is my own interpretation and how much is what Spinoza actually meant because it's from memory - when Spinoza puts God and Nature as equals, the theological equivalent would mean that you can either take God as completely ontological, meaning "everything is God", or you can take God out of the equation - because you can say that Nature is exactly it. This would mean that "God" or "without-God" [similar to "something" and "nothing"] means exactly the same epistemology-wise - although definitely not the same theology-wise). I hope this is clear enough. Tell me if you think this question should be closed and the original edited instead. Edit: I just want to emphasize the statement in my question by phrasing it a bit more radically - why do we even ask the "why there is something rather than nothing" question? Why isn't it obvious that this question is meaningless because there both "something" and "nothing" are equal? In maybe a bit odd example - isn't it the same as asking why is the result of some calculation is 1 instead of 0? And although it may have philosophical significant, is it really that big as it is usually being portrait to be? 

A False Presupposition: " So, theists don't??? I am supposing that the original question is actually addressing . 

Specific Examples where Objectivity was appropriately set aside for other forms of reasoning would sufficiently answer the question. 

2. The Plausibility of Pleasure: Suppose that "God" is defined, (at least in part), as the creator of beings. Then analogously, if we created beings - we could be considered "gods". And, if we find pleasure in our creation - then it stands to reason that our own creator would plausibly find pleasure too. The question then becomes - why are we finding pleasure in creating beings? 

Partnership: Advocating for, helping, and Challenging each other; (Psalms 21:1, Isaiah 7:1; Matthew 1:23). Intimacy: In-to-me-see, revealing own heart and perceiving the heart of others; (Isaiah 66:2, etc.) Beauty: Art, Form, etc.; (Isaiah 61:3, etc.) 

Obviously, I am speaking to some common Scriptural passages - to avoid the meritless claims of a mis-deific characterization, (like "God" as a "celestial-dictator", solipsistic, and self-fulfilling, etc.); Obviously this argument only aspires to an abductive or inductive conclusion - through analogy, as it probably isn't valid to actually dogmatically represent a non-corporeal "God" dwelling in a transcendent domain of reality - which would be hard to relate to. 

(*although there are the ways that's been shown in the answers to Alexander's question How can something non-physical exist?, the first positing the distinction in abstractness/concreteness but agrees to providing physicality all of the causal realm [which isn't what I'm seeking]; the second doesn't really distinct them but rather takes a sort of holistic/monistic approach, which isn't bad but doesn't yet answers the question to its full extent [even in this holistic approach one needs to distinct where the physical end and the non-physical starts]; and another answer distributes the physical and non-physical to different areas of existence, which [I think] renders every attempt to bring non-physical causality to science as futile) 

In philosophy and science, we quite often make systematic approaches that limits our thoughts to be as accurate as possible. Examples are endless - basically every logical system, every epistemological research, they all at some level try to do things similar to (merely the best example I can think of) Popper with the distinction of science and pseudo-science. We make assumptions for what is true, such as it has to be logical, it has to make sense, it has to have clear connection to our empirical world, it has to be compatible with our moral beliefs, etc. I ask, why do we make such assumptions about the nature of the world? How do we know it even fits within our possible scope of knowledge? What keeps us from having a completely skeptical (Hume style, though even he wasn't completely skeptical) view on the world, or the radical theistic view of "we can't know nothing about nature because God works in mysterious ways"? This question seem to aim for skepticism at its core, but do note that the question is mainly about the "limiting" of the possibilities of truth. 

2.5. A Good Faith Effort to Address Confirmation Biases: Yes, there are "Logic" and "Science" biases too. (The historical debate over the exact nature of mankind's evolution is a great example, the Scriptural account being one of the first examples of genetic engineering.) Mankind, still in its infancy, cannot rationally assert which bias is more valid than others, let alone argue that each bias doesn't have some validity in their own right. The Scientific method, at the very least, requires an assessment of rival hypotheses. Accordingly, it is often observed that when rival hypotheses are rejected - those hypotheses often evolve, and even the de-facto hypotheses mature too. It is prima-facie apparent that each different confirmation bias has led to hypotheses that have challenged and refined other hypotheses under different biases. This mechanic of intra-accountability between standards of truth has added, and still adds value, to the scientific method - is not too burdensome, and risks can be reasonably mitigated. Regardless, this mechanic of intra-accountability can only be dismissed according to the same exact principles that other mechanics in scientific development could be dismissed. Until that burden of proof is met - then it is not reasonable to dismiss the "dialectic" between "Theism" and "Science". (Whether that burden of proof has already been met, or how it could be met, is a great question, tbh.) 

The widely used (especially by laymen atheists in theology debates) term of "God of gaps" (the idea that theists explain unexplained scientific phenomenons by invoking God as the reason, filling that unexplained [or, yet-to-be-explained] gap in science) is quite known to be used in science/religion debates. What happens more than often in those (mostly laymen) debates is that this argument is being invoked against a metaphysical argument for God. What I'd like to ask (I assume the answer is obvious, but I'm not exactly sure, maybe there was a discussion around this subject) is whether or not it's "correct" (logically) to invoke the "God of gaps" argument in a metaphysical debate? 

Postmodern nihilism - the postmodern position that says "there's no one truth", which leads to a nihilism that denies objectivity, and is more popular today because, well, postmodern is quite popular today as it's a new school in philosophy. Existential nihilism - the existential crisis of "there's no meaning to life, we are nothing compared to the billions of years of the universe", which leads to a nihilism that denies any sort of hope and aspiration for a meaning. 

*by "progression of philosophy" I mean like for example how Kuhn identifies progression of science as paradigms, or the classic linear view of progression. 

Logic: That which is true, because it must be. (Vulnerable to Creative, Cleverer, Thinking.) Empirical Evidence: What is physically observable. (Vulnerable to full awareness of a Causal Domain.) Moral Veracity: What is equanimitable, (Limited by Entropy). Wisdom: What brings fulness of life - in the context of eternity, (Limited by lack of transcendent awareness.) etc., etc. - Tradition, et al. 

In that case, it is not necessary for "A" to be true, as "B" is another explanation. Although, both A and B are "Truths" in form - the type of "Truth" that "A" is, (a plausible truth) is not interchangeable with deductive truth. Even if "A" IS deductively true, within our own "Causal Domain", it is NOT the case that it MUST be true within this "Logic Domain". So, "A" is not "True" [deductively true], because it is not necessarily true - nor false - in this context/domain. 

Note 1: In Deductive, Inductive, and Abductive Logic, the term "Necessarily" changes to "Probably" and then "Plausibly". Note 2: This "definition" applies within the contexts of logic and even causality, (it breaks down in metaphysics, etc.; In metaphysics it is not necessary that "a square must have 4 equal sides"). In the context of logic, this definition could be falsified if these definitions somehow do not apply to a valid conclusion following a valid syllogism. Disproving a "Truth":
