There exist many works from fiction which are secular in the sense of your definition, i.e., free from religion or mythology. Just to name two modern authors: Henry Miller (Quiet days in Clichy) or Max Frisch (Homo faber). In addition: A novel dealing with questions of moral can be a secular work. Moral and religion are not necessarily linked. There exist many systems of moral without religious foundation, e.g., Kant's Categorical Imperative. 

A similar distinction marks the beginning of European philosophy of science: Aristotle starts his lectures on „metaphysics“ (Book 1) by distinguishing different kinds of knowledge. In ascending order: 

In the second passage of your question you yourself give arguments that your question is ill-posed. In my opinion the decision about assuming the existence of the Jewish god should be made on the explanatory value of such a hypothesis: 

It is one of the fundamental claims of Kant in his Critique of Pure Reason (CPR) that the answer to your question Can Free Will exist in a Causal Material Word? is Yes. Kant in the third antinomy of pure reason (CPR B472ff) deals with the thesis 

The human colour vision is bound to the cones. We have three types of cones with maximum of absorption in the wavelength domain respectively 

Of course, sensations and other mental processes are not material. Electrochemical processes were unknown to Descartes. His characterization of res extensa derives from the restricted mechanical view of his time. But when repeated today, the argument is a bit outdated: Today we say that mental processes are a kind of information processing, i.e. the basic term is information. Information processing always needs a material or better a physical substratum, e.g. nerve cells and the electrochemical processes of information processing. Information cannot be equated with these physical processes, but information presupposes the existence of these processes. A first bridge between physics and information theory is the concept of the entropy of a message. In the context of neuroscience this bridge has to be broadened to join physics and informatics and create a monistic and scientific view which incorporates mental processes. Summing up: Descartes is right that mental processes are not material. But the scope of his approach is too narrow to be relevant for today's investigations. 

Note that Aristotle's concept is broader than today's why-question which often asks just for a causal reasoning in the sense of causa efficiens. Added. As Mauro correctly quotes in his comment: According to Aristotle causa efficiens is the father [sic]. 

and its antithesis. After the exposition of the problem in the form an antinomy Kant starts his reasoning along the lines of his transcendental philosophy to come to the conclusion in B586: 

was published. It contains a series of essays by Einstein's scientific colleagues but also some essays about philosophical issues. E.g. an essay by Goedel about the relationship between the theory of relativity and idealist philosophy. (I am quoting from the German edition). The special feature of this volue are the comments and answers, Einstein makes to some of these essays. E.g. Einstein writes a long replay to Reichenbach's essay on the philosophical meaning of the theory of relativity. My personal opinion is that until today Einstein's impact on philosophy is limited. Because most philosophers do not understand e.g., the importance of the concept of spacetime as a physical quantity. They still discuss the concepts of time and the concept of space as two separated entities. 

If I correctly understand your mathematical example, then mathematics provides many examples of the following type: A problem has no solution in the context, where the problem is stated. But the problem has a solution in a broader context. For example take the problem: 1) Find all solutions of the quadratic equation x^2+1=0. The problem is stated in the context of real numbers. But the problem has no real solutions. Instead the problem has two solution, namely +i and -i, from the context of complex numbers. 2) Similarly, take the problem: Find all solutions of the quadratic equation x^2-2=0. The problem has no solution in the rational numbers, but it has two solutions in the real numbers. 

Essay II of Genealogy of Morals is entitled “Guilt, Bad Conscience, and Related Matters”. Nietzsche identifies “the contractual relationship between creditor and debtor” as the sociological source and origin of issues like injury, guilt, and punishment (section 4). Section 20 states that “the consciousness of being in debt to the gods” increases in direct proportionaly to the influence in society of the god concept. Hence one would conjecture that the decline of the importance of the god concept in society also diminuishes the strength of the consciousness of guilt. According to section 21 any assessment of guilt and duty from a moral point of view has to consider the human conscience. Nietzsche states that contrary to expectations the dominance of these concepts did not diminuish even for humans who no longer believe in god. The terms guilt and duty are no longer part of a contractual relation to god but move into the human conscience and become moral terms. The sentence 

According to the Trancendental Aesthetics of Kant's Critique of Pure Reason space and time are the two kinds of human intuition. I.e. the two basic dimensions to classify the input from our senses, step one of mental information processing. The second step is the information processing by means of the categories. The output of both steps is named experience. Quite different is the contemporary concept of space and time according to current physics. Here the best elaborated theory is the Theory of General Relativit. It combines space and time as two components of 4-dimensional spacetime. Both component have only a relative meaning, relative to a given observer and his system of coordinates. But more: Spacetime is a physical quantity. It is affected by other physical quantities like masses. The first confirmation of the resulting curvature of spacetime was the observed bending of light when passing near big masses like the sun. An actual confirmation would be the observation of gravitational waves (LIGO experiment). They are oscillation of spacetime due to the radiation of gravitational energy by the merge of two black holes. According to the General Theory of Relativity spacetime is an objective physical quantity "existing in itself", i.e. independent from the observer. This view is different from Kant's concept of space and time. During the history of physics before Einstein many different concepts of space or time were proposed, e.g. by Newton, Leibniz, Mach. Added. If the question is, whether Kant considers space a noumenon, my answer is "no". Space is an intuition, i.e. one of our means to classify the input from senses. On the opposite, noumena are hypothetical objects in the outer world, which create the input for our senses. 

The term picture theory of meaning refers to Wittgenstein’s description of language in his book Tractatus logico-philosophicus. From its 7 main propositions number 4 and its sub-propositions deal with language. Proposition 4: “The thought is the significant proposition. (= Der Gedanke ist der sinnvolle Satz.)” Proposition 4.1: “The proposition is a picture of reality. The proposition is a model of the reality as we think it is. (= Der Satz ist ein Bild der Wirklichkeit. Der Satz ist ein Modell der Wirklichkeit, so wie wir sie uns denken.)“ Different interpretations for „picture“ have been suggested. One interpretation takes “picture” as mapping in a mathematical sense. Accordingly, a picture is a structure preserving mapping from the proposition to reality, i.e. the structure of the proposition resembles the structure of reality. This covers the property of a “model” to represent the structure of the domain of investigation. Already this Ansatz of the picture theory can be questioned from the viewpoint of constructivism: We do not know the structure of reality, hence we cannot determine whether the proposition maps to its structure. All we can do, is constructing from our sensory input due to repeated experience a model with its structure. As Kant puts it: The thing in itself is not recognizable. Wittgenstein presupposes that reality has a structure which resembles the logical structure of our propositions. Notably, he presupposes a logical structure of reality resembling the logical structure of purged language. In my opinion, such view overestimates the role of logic as the primordial structure of reality. Overestimation, because reality exists much longer and previous to information processing according to the rules of logic.
