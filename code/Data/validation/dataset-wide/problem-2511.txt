Don't regret or repent! That is bad Karma. What you need to practice is Samma Vayama(The right effort) of the noble eightfold path. The effort (1) to prevent the arising of unarisen unwholesome states; (2) to abandon unwholesome states that have already arisen; (3) to arouse wholesome states that have not yet arisen; (4) to maintain and perfect wholesome states already arisen. Take the triple refuge and the five precepts every morning to remind yourself. Then at night, before going to sleep, reflect on the day's activities and see if you broke any precepts or if you can improve with Samma Vayama and try to do better next day. 

Also, whenever the Buddha smiled, a white ray of light would emanate from his teeth. This is caused by a special citta called the "Hasitoppada citta" which only Arahants have. The story of Mattakundali 

There's no "living Buddha". The Buddha existed more than 2500 years ago. Looks like you are overcome by lust/passion. Usually Patikulamanasikara meditation is recommended to such individuals 

All Buddhas are masculine. No, it is not harmful to invite the Buddha. In fact, the Buddha mentioned several times that a person who has perfected Sathara Iddipada can live the maximum life span of a human at that time. It was about 120 years back then. So he could've stayed another 40 years had he been invited. Venerable Ananda had several opportunities to invite the Buddha. But it's said that Mara(the evil god) prevented him every time. 

If one focuses on the emptiness of things, it will be the object of the mind at that time. Those(non Buddhists) who attain the Ākiṃcanyāyatana(7th Jhana) could get the false view that sphere of Nothingness is unchanging and permanent. But it isn't. 

Anger is eradicated at the 3rd stage(Anagami) of enlightenment. Lord Buddha is fully enlightened. It is impossible to make him or any other being who has reached or passed the stage of Anagami, angry. 

'Consciousness' is merely a momentary mental phenomenon that arises due to causes and performs the task of being aware. Nothing more, nothing less! 

There's no "Grandfather" Buddha. The Buddhas are not related. Prince Siddhartha's grandfathers were king Sinhahanu(father's side) and king Anjana(mother's side). Corporeal relics of each Buddha disintegrate as the respective Buddha Sasanas end. But it is possible for other relics to survive longer. Like the staff of the Buddha Kakusandha and the water filter of the Buddha Koṇāgamana in the Shwedagon Pagoda. 4.32 billion years is a Hindu count. An exact number isn't given in Buddhism. Only analogies provided. There are no 1000 Buddhas per Kalpa. The maximum you get is 5. It is called the Maha Badra Kalpa. The water filter is a piece of cloth, just like mentioned in the other answers. 

Patikulamanasikara is the meditation recommended to the person defeated by lust. Whenever you see people or think about people(including yourself), meditate on them in terms of those body parts until the perception of a person goes away and all you see is contemptible body parts. 

For Arahants, all actions are neither Kusala nor Akusala. For normal beings, all intentional actions are Karma. Which means it is either Kusala(wholesome) or Akusala(unwholesome) Karma. There is no "neutral Karma". But there are actions which are Karmically neutral. They are called Avyaakata. 

Yes, the owners can teach them good manners. Train them not to kill other animals, not to steal food from others. The more domesticated the animal is, the less bad Kamma it would commit. Also, you can have it listen to the Dhamma. It's a long shot, but it has worked on some occations. ex: The story of Manduka Devaputta 

The Vinaya pitaka is preached only if the life span is less than 50,000 years. When the life span is higher, the human world is said to be similar to heavens. The Buddhas usually introduce Vinaya rules when someone commits a misdemeanor. But the people are very virtuous during these times. So the need to introduce new rules does not arise. Ironically, the Dhamma lasts longer when there's no Vinaya pitaka, due to the much longer life span. Additional info: $URL$ 

Roaches usually come when you drop food pieces on the floor. Killing will break the first precept. So if you see any cockroaches inside, simply chase them out. Do not eat food everywhere. Do it at one place and clean up after. You can use a repellent like Dettol to clean. Close any holes where they can sneak through to your apartment. 

The statement must be untrue. There must be an intention to deceive. An effort must be made to deceive. The other person must know the meaning of what is expressed(whether he is deceived or not). 

Craving is not required to help your family. You only need compassion(Karuna) and kindness(Metta). Craving only makes you worried and sad. 

I used to have several pet cats and I remember rescuing many mice & squirrels from the jaws of death. The cat killing animals is not bad Karma for you, but here are some ways you can get bad Karma: 

No, it is not a general view. Theravada tradition does accept the Jataka stories. It is a part of Khuddaka Nikaya. But it is not unnatural for someone to doubt any part of the Tipitaka at any given time. Doubt can appear in the mind at any time. Apart from that, some teachers might opt to leave the Jataka stories out when they preach to western audiences as it may not be appealing to them. 

Unfortunately, this is one of the first questions people ask, especially if they are coming from a theistic background. As a result, many who require the belief of a 'God' as a precondition, turn away from Buddhism without even practicing and finding out for oneself. Likewise, many atheists also get turned off when they hear about hells/heavens/rebirth in Buddhism. To answer your question, if by 'God', you mean a creator/omnipotent/all governing entity, the answer is No. 'God' is a Christian term. At the time of the Buddha, words like 'Mahābrahmā' or 'Brahma' were used to describe such concepts. Brahmajala sutta talks in detail about how this belief was originated. The concept goes directly against one of the core teachings of Buddhism: "Sabbe Dhamma Anatta" - all phenomena are non-self or devoid of a soul. Even a Jataka story questions the belief in such a being: 

But this doesn't imply compassion(Karuna) and kindness(Metta) are unimportant. They have many useful benefits and they help us to stay away from hells by subduing our cruelty and hatred. That is very conducive to attaining Nibbana. Realising that is wisdom. When a being attains or passes the state of Anagami, he removes aversion completely. Then there's no obstacle in his mind for compassion and kindness to arise, when he interacts with people. That's why they are naturally inclined to help other beings attain enlightenment. That is the reason why we even have Buddhism today. If the Buddha did not have any compassion towards the worldlings, he wouldn't have preached the Dhamma just because the Maha Brahma invited. Compassion and wisdom can work in tandem. Ex: Maha Karuna Samapatti Nana of the Buddha. But compassion is not a requirement for wisdom to be present. 

Knowing is a part of the experience. An experience is merely the arising and vanishing of the five aggregates: Rupa(form), Vedana(feeling), Sanna(perception), Sankhara(mental formations), Vinnana(knowing/awareness). If the meditation is done correctly, the awareness can be seen as merely an aspect of the experience along with the other 4 that comes and goes. Not as a person. 

Each intention is it's own Karma. Whether one intention is better than the other depends on the purity of the intention. In other words, if it's defiled by greed, hatred and ignorance. 

No, it is very likely, even scientifically speaking, to have similar living conditions elsewhere in the universe. In November 2013, astronomers reported, based on Kepler space mission data, that there could be as many as 40 billion Earth-sized planets orbiting in the habitable zones of Sun-like stars and red dwarfs in the Milky Way, 11 billion of which may be orbiting Sun-like stars. 

In an ultimate sense the goal of charity in Buddhism is to cultivate a wholesome mental quality that helps to attain enlightenment. It's not about fixing what's wrong with the world. There are no others or 'oneself' involved in that sense. 

The better you get at mindfulness while you are awake, the less dreams you will see while you are asleep. When you go to sleep, take the lying posture as the primary object of meditation and practice mindfulness until you fall asleep. If you still keep dreaming on a daily basis, you should get advice on your meditation technique and get it readjusted. 

All conditioned or caused phenomena are bad. Because they are unsatisfying. That which is not conditioned or caused is good. It is good for anyone who achieves it. This problem occurs when you think that 'good' means a person experiencing a pleasurable mental or physical feeling. Nibbana is not a feeling. All feelings are caused. It's an existing phenomenon that cuts off the cause of suffering at the moment of attainment. 

Nothing happens for a reason. Reason is something given by us. Everything except Nibbana happens & happens due to causes. Nibbana doesn't happen, it is existent. Thus not caused. 

According to the above definition, 'escapism' is unskillful even by common sense standards. ex: Listening to songs to deal with your stomachache. It is not "separating 'self' from body". It is "not taking the body or mind as a 'self'" as neither is qualified to be considered as a self in reality. Thus no escapism involved. Working to remove desire is the opposite of 'escapism' as desire is the origin of suffering - 2nd noble truth. 

Dyana meditation is basically keeping your focus on one object. Various forms of it can be found in many religions. There's nothing exceptional about it. Even christians/muslims praying to a God is a type of concentration meditation that could lead to the first Dyana. In that case, the object of focus is conceptual or fictional. In Buddhism also you can find types of Dyana meditations as they are useful methods of developing concentration and subduing defilements. But what makes Buddhism exceptional is Vipassana meditation. This meditation is not found in any other religion. Then there are so many unique teachings like the four noble truths, the noble eightfold path, most of the teachings in the sutta, abhidhamma, vinaya pitakas that amount to 84,000 teachings. So if someone claims that the Buddha copied almost everything from Yoga, it only speaks of his lack of knowledge in Buddhism. 

Yes, your understanding of Metta is wrong. ex: If you are doing Metta towards a person who wishes to rob a bank, you don't wish the robbery to succeed. You simply wish happiness to arise in his mind so he does not need to rob. If Person-A wants to beat Person-B, you don't wish for that to happen. You simply wish for Person-A's anger to subside. Metta does not mean wishing for beings to give in to their defilements. 

This is not possible! Bad and good things happen because of causes. If the causes are not present for something to happen, you simply can't make it happen, regardless of your mood. To take the same example, just because you pray to a god, you won't get the things you pray for. There should be someone listening, who is in a position to give you what you want. And that being should decide to help in the way you want. 

It's a highly subjective question. Someone might desire the taste of a vegetable curry more than a meat curry. Someone might desire the taste of chocolate or ice-cream more than the taste of meat. Someone might desire liquor consumption more than meat. It has nothing to do with the number of animals killed. On the other hand, eating meat does not require desire. Even enlightened beings consume meat. Unwholesomeness comes when you desire or dislike the taste or start worrying about whether you are responsible for the dead animal.
