I think the above suttas are not about dysfunctional families. For example, SN 37.29 & 30 say dysfunctional wives are expelled from a family. Dhamma practise is about developing virtue and maintaining that virtue in all circumstances. DN 31 describes have people in various relationships should ideally relate to one other. If people don't relate to each other properly, these relationship can be ended. In DN 31, it is said: 

Celibacy is freedom & also saves lots of money because when sexual desire ends, most other forms of sensual attraction & desire also end. No more buying expensive flowers & restaurant food. 

I doubt the laws of kamma can be reconciled with the laws of evolution for many reasons, such as: (1) Buddhism only proposes good results come from good kamma. The Buddhist laws of kamma are not about biological survival & evolution but about psychological happiness & suffering. (2) Where as Darwinian evolution (I assume) would propose both good actions (e.g., loving off-spring; living in balance with environment) and bad actions (e.g., killing, stealing, raping &/or lying/deceiving when required) contribute to survival & thus evolution. (3) The supreme practise & goal of Buddhism (the noble eightfold path) results in celibacy & non-reproduction, thus a diminishing of the gene-pool of enlightenment genes (dhamma dhatu). (4) Buddhism states the fully-enlightened being or 'arahant' has completed human spiritual evolution where as Darwinism (I assume) would not offer any completion or fulfillment of evolution. (5) In short, Buddhism is spiritual evolution while Darwinism is biological evolution, i.e., miles apart. 

If the mind remains non-attached & concentrated, the rapture will calm and pleasure or happiness will appear, which is a more refined pleasant feeling than rapture. Rapture (piti) is very vibrant, bubbly, agitating & seductive where as happiness (sukha) is more subtle, calm & soothing. 

Is this a dodgy quote (despite coming from the exalted MN 22) because birth stories appear to be later additions? This said, I did try to compile 'birth stories' and only found around a dozen in the Buddhavaca suttas, such as AN 3.15; MN 50; MN 81; MN 123; MN 143; etc; which seem to be in the style of later works, such as the Jataka Tales, Buddhavamsa & Apadana. The lokuttara dhamma in SN 22.79 says all memories of the past are mere aggregates & not-self. 

You may ask yourself when suffering: "Why am I suffering?". The general answer is because of change & loss, i.e., aging-&-death. Then ask: "Why did aging-&-death cause me to suffering?" The answer is because I ignorantly regarded the lost or deceased object to be "I", "me" & "mine"; I took birth as the 'owner' of those objects. Below is what famous Thai monk Ajahn Chah had to say about this: 

The explanation about the 'vaci sankhara' (which is bolded) clearly states thought is the cause of speech. If this is true, how can thought be the "verbal fabrication" when it is obvious that: (a) speech is the verbal fabrication and (b) thought is that which fabricates (or causes) the speech? Similarly, in MN 10, contemplating the 'citta' means observing to see whether the citta ('the mind-heart') has greed or not, hatred or not, delusion or not, etc. Therefore, how can perception & feeling be the "mental (citta) fabrication" when many suttas state it is feelings & perceptions that are the cause of mental states of greed, hatred & delusion (as shown below)? 

To believe nothing happens is the hindrance of doubt rather than the spiritual power of faith/trust. A person wishing to fully practise the Buddhist path should have faith in the teachings. Before the mind can naturally energize & develop buoyancy & joy, it must settle down, which can appear stagnant for a time. 

This is confirmed by SN 5.10, which states the arising of the view of "a being" is the arising of suffering: 

This is not much to explain here. There is no evidence for results of kamma outside of your conscious experience. You have a conscience. The more you meditate & are sensitive to the heart, the clearer your conscience, the more compassion you have, the more ability to reason with wisdom. If the mind is free from greed & lust for food, it can calmly make a sensitive decision based on weighing various factors (costs & benefits). People have always eating meat for food, meat will always be available, we certainly feel better knowing we are minimizing harm & damage. The Buddha's attitude for food is summed in the Puttamansa Sutta. 

Hardcore Dharma is an branch of American Buddhism, like the self-proclaimed hardcorers in this video starting at 5:52. Instead of wearing saffron robes, hardcorers dress in black. 

Therefore, the Buddhist approach would be to treat physical (brain) illness with physical medicine, which is why Buddhist meditation is generally not recommended for strong forms of these illnesses. However, visiting, talking to & socialising with monks & nuns who are highly developed in loving-kindness (metta) can help people with such illnesses feel more emotionally secure, loved & balanced. In other words, there is no stigma in Buddhism surrounding these illnesses. Buddhism teaches every component of the body & mind can be subjected to injury, disease &/or illness due to decay, natural imperfection & impermanence. 

Buddhism is not about belief. Buddhism is for people who desperately need to find peace because the world is not an attractive place for them. If you still believe TV, movies, sex, luxury, fancy cars, boats, video games, porn, family, God, Jesus, etc, are attractive, desirable & worthwhile things, enlightenment is probably not for you. 

The reflections you are doing are both excellent & necessary however they are the development of right view and not the development of right concentration. The development of concentration is developing a quiet & still mind. In developing a quiet & still mind, the right view reflections you are doing are used only when a hindrance arises or when grasping/attachment to meditation arises. 

The mind has a wisdom faculty to discern emptiness. It is not possible to explain how or why this can occur. The Pali suttas simply say: 

How to reach jhana is explained in SN 48.10, in the last part about concentration. Since jhana is a state of non-thinking, how can it be reached by reading, thinking, planning & wanting? 

The six computer screens are like the six consciousness. The CPU is like manas. The hard drive is like alaya or citta. 

The 2nd mark of conditioned phenomena (not 'existence') is 'unsatisfactoriness' rather than 'suffering'. When the mind sees the breath, due to its impermanence, cannot be relied on for true happiness, it sees 'dukkha'. I suppose if the mind also sees due to impermanence, if the mind clings to the breath, this clinging will bring suffering because the clung-to breath will change & disappear, this can also count as seeing 'dukkha' in the breath (I suppose, if we cheat a little). 

Ud 8.1 says Nibbana is not a "world" (loka) or "other world" (paraloka). Any "world" includes suffering (SN 12.44). Nibbana is the cessation of the world (lokanirodha√±ca; AN 4.45). 

Obviously, smoking is not compatible with the Noble Eightfold Path. In Asian Buddhist countries, the majority of monks serve a social/cultural purpose & therefore do not practise the (entire) Noble Eightfold Path and may smoke as a cultural norm. 

The Buddhist idea seemed to exist systematically before the Hindu idea. At least the idea of moksha with Brahma appears to be not mentioned in the Pali suttas, which report discussions with Brahmans who followed the Vedas. While the early Upanishads are not mentioned in the Pali suttas, it appears the ideas in them about moksha seem to be either immature or not widespread at the time of the Buddha. 

Absolutely. MN 117 states kamma & results ('rebirth') is a mundane teaching siding with merit & attachment. What this means is the results of kamma is always taken personally, such as "I did good", "I did bad", "I am happy", "I am unhappy". Kamma has self-view, unless it is noble kamma that ends kamma (per AN 6.63). 

I doubt it. I think sankappa & cetana are synonymous and both probably can be unwholesome, wholesome & noble. MN 117 refers to unwholesome & ignoble sankappa. 

No. I do not believe a Buddha can teach this. It is only a view of those who reject the Dhamma is visible here & now. The sutta (SN 35.145) about "old kamma" refers to the sense organs (not the aggregates) and says they "ought to be viewed as old kamma", which means the noble practitioner should not let the mind drift back to the past, thinking about old kamma but, instead, focus on the sense organs. 

There are two kinds of Nibbana, namely: (i) Nibbana that can be experienced & (ii) Nibbana that is the ending of sense experience which can only be inferred. To quote: 

In summary, a solution to cure these sexual disorders is to see clearly they are disorders that bring suffering rather than activities that bring sustainable happiness. 

The word is 'bhagava', from 'bhaga'. You may prefer 'Fortunate One' if you believe 'blessings' can only be given by a person or a god. 

The idea is wrong that meditation is 'expanding the mind' while 'concentration is narrowing the mind' and that the two are mutually exclusive. The word 'mindfulness' ('sati') in Buddhism means to 'remember to apply' or 'keep in mind' the Buddhist path; which means to keep the mind in a clear & aware state that is free from unwholesome & unbeneficial mental states, such as craving & distracting thoughts. The word for 'concentration' in Buddhism is 'samadhi'. The word 'samadhi' means 'collectedness' & refers to when the mind gathers together its energy, power, awareness, wisdom & other wholesome qualities due to its practise of 'mindfulness'. The Pali scriptures states: 

It is unlikely the Mahasi method brings quicker wisdom because the method is based in verbal thought noting. Whatever degree of conceptual thought exists, to that degree the clarity of consciousness available for genuine insight is diminished. 

SN 22.59 states experiencing Nibbana requires the dispassion (viraga) that occurs from completely realising the impermanence, unsatisfactoriness & not-self of every type of consciousness & the other four aggregates. 

Feelings are not always caused by ignorance because the Pali suttas state arahants & Buddhas experience feelings: 

The term 'kaya-sankhara' is defined in MN 44 as the 'in & out breathing'. The same term is found in step 4 of Anapanasati & in the 2nd nidana of Paticcasamuppada, as follows: 

To focus, you remember to keep the mind on the meditation object (breathing) &, when the mind strays, just bring it back to the object. When the mind strays, it is not "you" that is intentionally straying but the mind itself therefore it is not logical to judge "yourself" since the mind is the problem rather than "yourself". If the mind is straying a lot and you are judging yourself a lot, you may have to train the mind new ways of acknowledging the straying, such as mentally noting: "The mind is straying"; "the mind has craving"; "the mind has anger"; "the mind is restless"; etc or simply: "straying"; "craving"; "anger"; "restlessness", etc. In this way, instead of judging "yourself" & attributing blame upon "yourself" unnecessarily & unwarrantedly, the mind is judged or the states of mind are judged. There are preliminary meditation techniques for beginners such as the popular Mahasi Sayadaw method that use this kind of mental noting. You may check out these methods or, otherwise, read about how the Buddha dealt with his straying mind in the sutta on Two Kinds of Thinking. 

The immaterial jhana are optional & not required for enlightenment (refer to SN 12.70), which is why immaterial jhana are not included in the noble eightfold path (refer to SN 45.8). The Buddha attained enlightenment by developing the 4th material jhana (refer to MN 19). However, the immaterial jhana are described in many suttas (such as in detail in MN 111) because they are a natural development of concentration or quieting (refer to SN 36.10). I recommend reading MN 111. 

The 1st jhana does not uproot or destroy sensual delight. It appears only the Non-Returner & certainly the Arahant have uprooted sensual delight. Therefore, sensual delight can still arise after the 1st jhana has been attained. This said, it is probably unlikely a person can attain jhana who is concerned about losing art & beauty. Jhana is not like buying a better motor car or more luxurious house. 

I think this issue you are raising is not really related to Buddhist meditation practices but to the individual. Some individuals, be they Buddhist or non-Buddhist, religious or non-religious, have a keen sense of not harming others & being responsible towards others. Others do not. That said, about Buddhism, my impression is cultural Buddhism, both Western & Asian, is quite weak in its explanations of sexual misconduct to its lay followers since I get the impression monks don't want to put pressure on people by over-moralising. Therefore, it can be expected that people may practise Buddhist meditation for 10 years but have no real sense of the purpose of the precepts. In fact, there are enough Buddhist teachers that practise sexual misconduct. Sexuality is a very strong emotion/drive thus many people struggle to manage it. 

Feelings/sensations ('vedana') are pleasure & pain (or unpleasantness). For example, the taste of ice-cream, being sweet, is a pleasurable sensation. The smell & sight of a rotting dead animal is an unpleasant feeling. Or a mosquito biting is a painful sensation. Emotions/cravings/desires/defilements ('kilesa') in Buddhism are categorized into three types: (1) greed/lust/love; (2) anger/hatred; & (3) confusion (including fear)/ delusion/self-obsession. (When there is a lack of mindfulness) pleasant feelings give rise to greed or desire towards that pleasant feeling & experience. Unpleasant feelings give rise to hatred, anger, aversion or desire against that unpleasant feeling & experience. 'Vague' feelings give rise to confusion, fear, etc, circling around that 'vague' feeling (which Buddhism calls 'neither-pleasant-nor-unpleasant feeling'). The practise of Buddhism is that of having mindfulness & wisdom when feelings occur. For example, you may feel pleasure towards the sight of expensive food but have the wisdom to realise you cannot afford that food. Such wisdom will eliminate the desire/craving towards that pleasant food. Or you may feel pleasure towards the sight of your friend's beautiful wife but have the care, good-will & wisdom to know lust for your friend's wife is wrong, inappropriate & harmful. Or you may feel displeasure in your work against a difficult client but know if you exhibit anger in your voice you may lose the client or have a complaint lodged against you. In Buddhism, it is taught pleasant & unpleasant feelings will always occur. Even Buddhas have pleasant & unpleasant feelings. But Buddhas, because of their mindfulness & wisdom, do not have the arising of unwise emotions/desires that lead to harm & suffering. 

The Pali scriptures define consciousness as 'sense cognition' or 'sense awareness'. This is the most accurate single definition to use. 

The Pali suttas provide accurate descriptions of Nirvana, such as the 'destruction of craving' (Dhammapada 154; MN 37); 'visible here-&-now destruction of greed, hatred & delusion' (AN 3.55; SN 45.7); 'supreme happiness' (Dhammapada 203); and 'Simile of the Ocean'. Therefore, the description by N√¢gasena given to King Millinda in his 80th dilemma should be compared to the Pali suttas to test its accuracy. That Nagasena offered a very lengthy answer shows he did not really have a "dilemma" & spoke falsely, when he said: 'Nirv√¢na, O king, has nothing similar to it. By no metaphor, or explanation, or reason, or argument can its form, or figure, or duration, or measure be made clear.' These links might help: Nibbana For Everyone & Bhikkhu Pesala What Is NibbƒÅna?
