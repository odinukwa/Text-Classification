I don't find it fully describes what it purports to though and it seems to cover syllable structures I'm so far unaware of in Lao. 

I was just answering a question about the origins of English and Latin and wanted to talk about their common ancestors but ran into a surprising problem. So we know the majority of languages in Europe and the Indian subcontinent are related under the name "Indo European". If you just want to look at the languages in the subcontinent there is the name "Indic". But when you want to look at the other half, I can't seem to find a name. English is a member of the Germanic family. Latin is a member of the Italic family. Both are on close branches on the European side of the Indo European tree but "European" is not the name of a language family as far as I am aware. When we talk about European languages the terms covers an area including unrelated languages such as Basque, Finnish, and Hungarian. So if "European" is not a name of a language family and Indo-European is far too vast, is there a term I'm overlooking? 

Now it seems okay. Coming to your tree, you must correct the and according to this hypothesis and you are good to go. 

What does that mean? I learned that an must always be at v-spec and is really and there. I -at first- thought that does not have any accusative argument, so is at V-spec, but that did not make any sense at all. So, from this point, it went through this way below: 

I think you ask more Chomskian side of computational linguistics, but I did not run across a thing on Chomsky's theory on computational linguistics (of course, that does not mean there is not). Statistical linguistics is way more computational since it uses corpora, parsers, statistics and possibilities. It is best to start with any corpus linguistics and statistical computational linguistics book and learn n-grams, bigrams, trigrams and other stuff. If you say "I want to parse my texts, use corpora and take statistics.", there are tons of libraries for NLP just like Java's LingPipe, OpenNLP, StanfordNLP, Apache UIMA, GATE, MALLET, FrameNET or Python's holy NLTK module and you can use those libraries to use texts or corpora to achieve any goal. (Assume that you work on a research about women and men complaining. You have samples and you use them to take statistics and generalize results. Or assume that you work on a research about a dead language. You can use those libraries to take statistics of that language to define most-common particles in that language.) On the other hand, if you say "I want to write my own parser, tokenizer, my own corpus database model...", you have to know any programming language, regular expression and statistics/probability knowledge. I do not know if Ruby does but Java and Python is best fit for this work. 

In Australia there are two creoles in daily use, Kriol (, also known as Roper River Creole etc) in the Northern Territory with about 30,000 speakers and Torres Strait Creole (, also known as Broken etc) in the Torres Strait Islands in far north Queensland with about 25,000 speakers. Are there any kind of papers or research which investigate or compare the two languages? Ideal would be something considering various aspects of language one by one (phonology, lexis, pronoun system, etc) and making direct comparisons or the approaches of the two languages such as "While does ... , does ...". 

This is where ambient language can enter your thoughts and confuse you. For me my Spanish is sub-fluent so mostly I can concentrate on a conversation I'm having with people without bothered by a loud TV in the background which would interfere with my thoughts in English. I do however find that I subconsciously eavesdrop on people speaking Spanish, even when I haven't used it for a while. 

Okay, so let's start with . DP hypothesis simply suggests that is a dependency of a in lexicon, which means [the dog] is DP, not an NP. You can test this on such structures having and at the same time. If you keep assuming the is complement of (and an will always be adjunct of ), the structure below would be grammatically valid: 

There are tons of diachronical researches on Turkish, Arabic language and Persian language but great amount of those works are owned by literally prescriptivists and written in Turkish. Keywords: Arapça, Farsça 

If you do not mind if it is Turkish or not: This is the library of TDK (Turkish Language Foundation). Unfortunately there is no single electronic documents but you can search keywords in catalogue. There is also National Thesis Center for searching any thesis. If you are abroad, there is no ability of downloading since registering is allowed for university members (including students) in Turkey, but you can take names and mail them to share their works with you. Coming to search, there is a search bar in the site below, you can use keywords to see the thesis on diachronic researches on it. (National Thesis Center also provides English site prefence for foreingners.) This is a catalogue for original manuscript by TDK. Do not forget all those resources are written in Turkish. 

Agglutinating languages tend to have many cases and tend not to meld the case affix with any gender or number affix so most would probably suit your needs. The ones most often discussed would be Turkish, Finnish, and Hungarian. More people talk about Turkish being easy to learn while you often hear the other two described as very difficult to learn. Here's an example for Turkish: 

*during last 10 years -> during the last 10 years *some of my friends in US -> some of my friends in the US *But they don't know why is that -> But they don't know why that is *not-native English speaker -> non-native English speaker. 

I just found out that the Lao word for "kangaroo" doesn't appear to be a direct loan from English. Both words are pronounced more or less as "ching choh". In fact it doesn't seem to be from French, Chinese, or Vietnamese either. Most languages just borrow the English word, but of the ones I can find that don't none of them look like the Lao and Thai words either. Now it's plausible that "ching choh" somehow is related to "kangaroo" but if so it's changed more in the borrowing most loanwords from English or French that I've come across. What is the actual etymology of these words? 

I'm looking for a verb network or verb dictionary project in Japanese which shows verbs with its own dependencies (like [iku DP DP] [kaeru DP] etc.). Is there any? 

If you want to look for an English resource, those are so rare but have a possibility of being much descriptive. For instance, this work seems to be a research on phonological structure of Arabic loanwords in Turkish. (Not free.) This is a page from Wikipedia. This work seems much more sociological, but it is worth to be seen. (Not free.) This is about Persian-Turkish relation. (Not free.) 

Is there really any reference that an occurs in another place rather than v-spec? If it is possible to see s in another place, does that apply to all verbs not having an accusative argument but only a ? If is specific to , then how do we describe the given example above? 

I've put "isolates" in scare quotes because this is probably not a standard meaning for the term "language isolate". But anyway I'm sure it's still abvious what I'm looking for. I was wondering about languages losing or merging tones until there are none left. Since that would take a long time we might not have evidence of such occuring. But what we might possibly have are instances of non-tonal languages within language families which otherwise consist mostly of tonal languages. If this doesn't exist I'm also interested in cases of a language with far fewer tones than most of its sibling and cousin languages. 

Though it's apparent that since English is included that this list might include languages which only make the distinction for pronouns and not nouns. If you want a list with only languages such as German and Russian I'm afraid I don't know how to narrow down the list on WALS. It also seems odd to me that the majority of Slavic languages are not included. This could be due to an animate/inanimate distinction leading to analyses that they have four genders. 

However, I'm assuming you are taking a syntax class, which means this is the visible part of iceberg. You have still lack of knowledge of , the roles on and (I mean the usual movement from v-spec to I-spec, but it depends on situation) etc. I mean I gave a tree, but it is not still valid for current generative grammar, I made it because it is based on your givings above, it is valid to your current state. You can get an information on DP hypothesis here for now. However, I recommend Radford's syntax books as a reference, those are great. The Valid Tree of Late Government and Binding Theory (Phases Not Included) 

However, this is a brand new hypothesis in syntax, an merged two sentences having a structure as below (I made it): 

In my syntax classes, I learnt that v-spec is specific for role. The thing is, I came across a structure in the resource below:
