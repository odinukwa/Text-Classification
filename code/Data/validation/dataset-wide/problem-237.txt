Is it possible to have an economy with no inflation? Yes. But the government fixing the price of one item will not do this. Suppose the government passes this law: One loaf of bread must cost one lobe, period. So what happens if there's a poor harvest and bakers can't produce as much bread as people want at 1 lobe per loaf? In a free market, if people want to buy 10,000 loaves but only 5,000 loaves are available, then the price goes up. This leads some people to decide to buy less bread or not buy any bread, perhaps buying rice or potatoes instead. It also encourages farmers and bakers to produce more bread to take advantage of the higher price. Eventually the price stabilizes at an amount where the quantity demanded equals the quantity available. If the government prevents that from happening, then there will be shortages. Maybe people have to wait on long lines to get bread, and the people at the end of the line are out of luck. Or you have to have the right connections to get bread: people who are friends with the baker get bread, or people who have political power. Or you get a black market: bakers start secretly selling most of their bread at a more realistic, market price. And what about the prices of all the other products out there? If those prices are allowed to fluctuate freely with the market, then okay, there is no inflation in the price of bread, but there could be inflation in the price of everything else. You could, of course, have government-set prices for everything. But then you just propagate the problem I discussed above: massive shortages in under-priced products. And who sets all these prices, and how? Who decides how much a pound of potatoes should cost compared to a loaf of bread? And if anything happens to change the relative value of two products, like new technology or a new source of imports or even just changes in taste, like people decide to eat more rice and less bread, now your prices are out of sync with true value, and there's more economic disruption. The real way to eliminate inflation is to control the money supply. The US started doing this fairly successfully back in the 1980s. To take an oversimplified example: Suppose the only thing there was to buy was bread, and there are 10 loaves available. If people have 10 lobes available to spend, then the price will stabilize at 1 lobe per loaf. If people have 20 lobes to spend, then the price will go up to 2 lobes per load. Etc. This is oversimplified in many ways: Assuming there is only one product to buy, assuming that each unit of money will be used for exactly one purchase, etc. But it's the general idea. Basically, when the US treasury sees prices increasing faster than the target range, they reduce the money supply. When they see increasing too slowly or falling, they increase the money supply. Or more often, they adjust the rate at which the money supply is increasing: it's pretty much always increasing, just faster or slower. Since that policy was adopted inflation in the US has mostly been kept to around 2% per year. They're not all-knowing or all-powerful so they can't manage it perfectly, but they're doing fairly well. 

How much detail do you need for your story to make sense? As others have noted, national borders tend to run along coastlines, rivers, and mountain ranges. But there are plenty of exceptions, especially when no convenient river or mountain range was available in the general vicinity of where two nations bumped against each other. Sure, you could write a history of the world up to this point to explain how your borders came to be. But is that necessary? If in a story a writer says, "Bob was tall and had red hair", he normally doesn't find it necessary to trace Bob's genetic history back to Noah to explain exactly how he came by this traits. If for some reason you need an unusual national border in your story -- if say, country A is on the west side of the ocean and also control a tiny strip on the east side of the ocean, and country B is then east of that strip -- you might need a couple of sentences of explanation of how that came to be. But if the history isn't relevant to the story, even that probably isn't necessary. If I'm reading a story set in a ficitonal world, or in some part of the world where I'm not familiar with the geography, I don't recall ever wondering, "Hey, wait a minute! How come the border between Foobar and Plughland runs through the Fwacbar Valley? Didn't the author say that there's a river near here? Why isn't the river the border? What's the history behind that?" Unless the story is about geography and politics, I doubt such a question would even come to the mind of 99.9% of readers. 

Your planet could have one or more moons that regular eclipse the sun. As each moon passes between the planet and the sun, the sun will go through phases. Of course we get this phenomenon on Earth, as the Moon occasionally eclipses the Sun. It's pretty rare on Earth, but one could imagine an orbit for the Moon that would make it more common. Namely, an orbit that is in precisely the same plane as the planet's orbit around its sun. If there are multiple moons in similar orbits, it would be more common still. 

The Indians did form nations: The Iroquois, Apache, Comanche, Arapaho, Navajo, etc. Whether they would have eventually invented more advanced technology is a question that is, I think, impossible to answer because it is speculating about a hypothetical. Some Indian nations -- the Aztecs, Inca, and Maya -- had advanced to levels comparable to ancient Egypt and Babylon. But most of the rest were still limited to stone age technology or just the beginnings of metal working. One could debate endlessly why this was so. (And just discussing it is liable to get you accused of racism.) Are Indians genetically indisposed to technology? Was it because of some environmental factors? Did they labor under bad governments or some other social liability? Lack of communication with other cultures to share knowledge? Religions that did not encourage a scientific world view? Just bad luck that they didn't get some crucial geniuses while Europe did? Etc. I'm sure there are a million theories. Depending on what theory you find convincing, you could then discuss what it would take to overcome the problem. Given that historians debate the question, for a fiction story you could pick a theory that makes your story work. 

The first question would be how effective these super-soldiers are. If one super-soldier is a match for 10,000 ordinary soldiers in combat, yeah, there'd be a lot of pressure for the other country to follow suit. If one super-soldier is a match for 1.2 ordinary soldiers, not so much. Are there countermeasures available? How difficult is it to "build" one of these super-soldiers? Etc. Is there any way to create anything comparable to the super-soldiers without killing people? Like can these people with the latent talents somehow learn to use their talents and become semi-super-soldiers themselves? How difficult is it for the people with the latent powers to escape? Presumably the ethical country has every incentive to welcome such refugees. Even if they can't or won't "use" them themselves, encouraging and helping them escape would deprive the enemy of the resources they need to create super-soldiers. For a fiction story, I'd think you could easily arrange the "facts" to make whatever outcome you want. If you want there to be incredible pressure on the ethical country, then make the super-soldiers extremely powerful and say that all attempts to counter them with anything other than your own super-soldiers have proved fruitless. If you want the ethical country to have an alternative, then make the super-soldiers less powerful, or say that the people with the latent powers can fight them, or whatever. When the scenario is complete fiction, you don't have to struggle with how to get the desired outcome. Just make something up. Of course the trick may be to make something up that makes an interesting story. 

Why is it that every city and town on Earth today does not declare independance and become a separate nation? I live in the U.S., probably the most successful revolutionaries in history. And yet since the revolution we have built up 50 states that stick together. Why doesn't Hawaii or Alaska or Texas rebel and form an independent nations? There are lots of reasons. The first and biggest reason: Declaring independance is not a free and easy thing. Assuming the central government objects and sends troops to keep control of the colony, property will be destroyed and people will die. If you lose, at a minimum the leaders will be executed or imprisoned. Depending on the brutality of the war there might be mass executions. The government might impose repressive measures to prevent a new revolution. Even if you win, a lot of people will likely die along the way. Going to war is not something that rational people do on a whim or for trivial reasons. You have to have serious grieviances. Second: cultural ties. If the people in the colony all have relatives back in the home country, and they share similar political, religious, and philosophical beliefs, and they all get along more or less, what would be the motive to declare independence? Why would they even want to? Third: as others have mentioned, economics. We could speculate about what technology is developed, but it could be centuries before a Mars colony would truly be economically self-sufficient. We tend to think of the "colonial period" in the New World as a brief time, but in fact it was 284 years from the arrival of Columbus to the Declaration of Independence. It was a longer time from the first colony to the first colony becoming independent than it is from the first colony becoming independent to today ... and Canada and South America were still colonies long after the U.S. was independent.
