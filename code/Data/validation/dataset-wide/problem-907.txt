So thats definitely true. It appears that he decided to incorporate his own experience into the books. When he writes 

This seems to indicate it was planned to stop on the number 75, though Carey doesn't mention why. It could just have easily ended slightly before if the climax was a few issues before hand, the repercussions didn't have to continue for so long. It could have been planned just to end on 75 because that is quite a nice number, but I doubt that is the case. It is most likely that Carey had noticed this and decided to likewise end on 75. The fact it was planned in advance to end on the same number seems to infer that it was intentional. 

There's not much evidence I could find, but it would be one hell of a coincidence The number 75 is pretty specific. For two comics to stop on that number would be some coincidence, especially because it is quite a small amount of issues. The only thing I could find which may indicate something was from the following interview: 

In Sappho 94 (τεθνάκην δ' ἀδόλως θέλω), there is this tercet at ll. 25-27, which is very incomplete, which Edmonds doesn't even have, and which Bibliotheca Augustana and Campbell p. 69 both read: 

This tells us that is probably a typo/mojibake for , given by LSJ as quoted by Perseus's Greek Word Study Tool as various things including , and that the incomprehensible must somehow mean . I looked for all possible combinations of vowels substituted for the 6 and endings, and found nothing on Perseus, but found , , on the Rocci dictionary. Not too fitting, but maybe. Back in the days when I translated Sappho, I had temporarily settled for , but now I guess a better way to do this would be , both meaning and keeping the initial consonant and possibly a vowel. Analysing other fragments in that safopoemas, 6 is almost certainly an omicron, and the chi could be a kappa, so we could have or , neither of which yields anything interesting on Perseus. I looked around for another source for this completion (possibly Reinach, which this document claims to be following in the quote below), but was unable to find any. So my question is: what was this reconstruction supposed to look like, and who proposed it, and of course, how supported is this amongst critics? Quote from safopoemas.doc's introduction 

As for why Lewis and Tolkien set up the group in the first place - probably for discussion about the works they were writing, and connecting to other writers. Why do you set up a chess club? For practice, fun, and people. It seems like that would be why they would set up a group like that. This is basically what it says in The Inklings by Humphrey Carpenter: 

In The Mysterious Benedict Society series, the Whisperer is a machine that transmits thoughts and implants messages in people's brains, usually harmful. And the Emergency is the tense, stressful situation artificially created by the Whisperer that doesn't actually exist. Are either of these symbolic? 

Tolkien and Lewis started it when Tolkien returned to Oxford. I'll answer the questions that you mentioned one by one. Unless otherwise specified, the quotes come from Inside The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe by James Stuart Bell, Carrie Pyykkonen, and Linda Washington, chapter 5. When was it set up? 

This quote was of course from the Christmas hating Ebenezer Scrooge. However, if we quote this as coming from Dickens, someone not familiar with his book may assume that Dickens hated Christmas, which we have no evidence for. He may have written the words, but it isn't his quote. He is giving the words to a character. But if we quote it to Ebenezer Scrooge, again someone not familiar with the name may assume they are a real person. So it seems we can't just quote one or the other. Someone made the point that if the character is really famous we can just quote their name, but that's not true. Not everyone will have heard of a character, and someone else made the point they wont be as famous in a couple of hundred years. There have been discussions similar on english.se and writers.se, but none give a definite answer. However, one of the answers gives a link to this site. It reaches the conclusion at the bottom that: 

The book opens with the main character, Jimmy Carter, playing baseball - this could be what you're remembering as scouting. The cover does have the main character on it, wearing dark glasses. The book was published in 1994, so it's within the time frame. I don't know enough about it to say for sure, but it appears to match your description, from what I can tell. 

At the time, there were many Jewish bankers/moneylenders, so moneylenders were probably often portrayed as Jews. For a very long time, the Jews have been associated with banking and money. There are a few reasons, such as that there were a lot of Jewish bankers after the 11th century. In The Encyclopedia Judaica, in their article on Banking and Bankers, in the section on Europe, they say: 

In a relatively short while, I'll have to write a blog post on this poem, so I've been doing some research into the sources. The first is P.Oxy. 1232, an image of which is the following. 

Wharton seems to not even have the fragment, and then safopoemas. This weird doc full of horrid typos, which is no longer available at the link it was at, which is now broken, but can be found as a pdf here, with the same garbage typos as the doc version, and is based on a Spanish edition of Sappho, has this semi-garbage: 

From these, I can find most of what the text at Greek Wikisource (very end of page) has. However, there is a bit that is not in these images. From what I see on Grenfell and Hunt's book on the Oxyrhynchus Papyri (HUGE DOCUMENT, Firefox crashed while I tried to find the page of the below image), P.Oxy.1232 is supposed to have a couple other fragments, one of which they transcribe as: 

(I found this by Googling , finding this British Library page, looking at the scan, seeing the quote I mentioned above, then Googling and finding a link to the Project Gutenburg page.) 

Was Hardy here exposing his own anti-Semitic prejudices here, or was he merely commenting on the general sentiment in England at the time relating to Judaism? 

Why does Merion react so strongly? I understand that they are not one specific gender at all times, like the brunette seems to be insinuating, but why not just say 'I'm bi-gendered'? Why immediately blow up at the girl? 

Of course, the boundaries are a bit blurry. They are very similar, and there are cases where either would apply. But in general, a graphic novel is longer and more unified. 

I understand that Beatrice is basically saying 'I would rather X than hearing a man say he loves me.' But I don't understand the dog barking at a crow bit. What does a dog barking at a crow signify? I did some research and found that a crow is a bad omen, so perhaps the dog barking is warning the owner of a bad omen? 

Here is a guide to citing fiction by Monmouth University. It doesn't say anything about quoting characters, but it does say the following: 

I believe the story you are after is the short story The split cherry tree by Jesse Stuart written in 1939. I found this by searching 'story boy father school teacher microscope' and it was the fourth or fifth hit. I read the story and as I couldn't find a good conclusive summary online I wrote one myself: 

What they are saying here, is that this character is making the other people do his work for him - and that these people are doing the same thing, pushing their work onto other people. (FWIW, they are commonly referred to as help vampires across the Stack Exchange network.) Since Tom Sawyer tricked the other people into doing the work that he was supposed to do, they are comparing these people to him. 

When Sophie is taking her religion studies test, she writes this: (page 124 in my edition; chapter "Hellenism") 

However, do we see any indication that he wanted to go to sea? He had seemed pretty happy where he was. Is there any indication in the rest of the novel that he wanted to go to sea?
