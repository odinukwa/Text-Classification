My question is somewhat opposite than most people would expect. So here it is... Last year, I was thinking to make a career transition into some very specific management kind of roles from an Engineering background. During the same time, some recruiters from top-notch tech companies contacted me for some great engineering career opportunities (same kind of role/track that I am doing currently). I respectfully turned them down saying that it does not match my future career goals although the position is very lucrative in terms of recognition and financially. Note that I turned it down right at the onset i.e. without doing any telephone or in-person interviews which kind of made sense since I did not want to waste anyone's time. Now after researching a bit more, I found that I need more experience to be in the kind of roles that I have been targeting and after doing some information interviews the general idea was to continue doing similar type of work (engineering) for few more years and then try again. So my question(s): Is it OK to contact those specific recruiters again. I understand that those position might not be available anymore but I want to make myself available if any such future opportunities arise. Also, what and more importantly how should I say tactfully that why I am interested again? What are the chances that they may take me seriously? I would really appreciate if anyone has been in a similar situation and have been successful at it. EDIT: Most of the recruiters that I talked about are recruiters working for the company and they are not necessarily 3rd party contract recruiters. 

I had a boss who struggled with social niceties like this. It just sort of didn't click with him. I didn't think about it much because he always seemed great at hobnobbing and building real (albeit professional) relationships with people. Then, we had a team member from a big client whom I just couldn't stand. He was obnoxious, boorish, inappropriate... you get the picture. Constantly walking around our office telling appalling stories and, mostly, racist or sexually explicit jokes. I just broke out in a sweat every time he came around and dreaded the thought. I asked my boss for his professional advice, and he said, "[guy]? I love [guy]!" And it struck me, he practiced. Every kind of professional social interaction, he had a mental script for, and he practiced and polished it every day. I realized that deep down, he would never be that kind of guy, but he understood the benefits of contributing to a pro-social workplace, and he considered it part of his job. My animus towards that client just evaporated, and after that, I "loved" it when he came around, too. He was never going to stop saying things that we all knew (and discussed privately) were wholly unacceptable on every level, but if I built a professional relationship with him, then we had things to talk about, and that was something I did have influence over. My stress was gone and I was able to go on to work with him on things. In your case, I'd consider coming up with a few stock phrases--how was your weekend, that commute was something else this morning, that sort of thing. Then, especially for the biggest talkers, try to remember one innocuous personal detail about them that you can ask about in a pinch, like a pet (species only), something specific about a family member (son's upcoming wedding, niece's new job--name is preferable here if you can remember it), or a hobby project in the works. And here's the other part of it. If you have good non-verbal communication, like you look them in the eye, smile, and have a pleasant tone in your voice, then you can get away with jumping on the end of a sentence if they're starting to launch into a story. You smile a little extra, give a little wave, and while you start to walk away, you say, "That sounds so nice! Well, I'll see you later!" and keep going to your desk. 

I have been helping another department (30% of my time) in my company as somebody left the role. Of course, I am doing this after my boss' approval. Now that department wants me to interview for the full-time position. I think there is a decent chance (60-70%) of getting selected. They are also interviewing other candidates which have more experience than me. Chances are even if I get selected, I will have to work with my current boss in my new role because of cross-functional dependencies within company. I am not too happy with my current job and my boss already is aware of my view on the current job. We are working to get this situation resolve. My worry is that if I tell my boss right now and if I don't get selected for the new position within company, it may backfire more than if he know about it later on. Should I tell or not? 

TBH, I think you're both wrong. If your computer use policy is to lock your computer when you're not there, your responsibility is to manually lock your computer. If you're away from your computer and it's logged in and unlocked, for whatever reason, the computer's not the one accountable, you are, so make sure you're the one who ensures that doesn't happen. That being said, that's a relatively widespread and--on its own--harmless office game, but your boss is making an irresponsible decision. He could well be putting himself and all of you at risk. First, he's encouraging behavior that doesn't reinforce good security standards, and that's a bad practice, regardless of the reason. But second, he's actually encouraging his subordinates to use the computers under someone else's identity, which is likely internally punishable by your company's policy and possibly, depending on your organization and your data, illegal. I don't know what you want to do with that information, but that's my viewpoint, based on experience. 

Beginning of last year, I was selected for the interview process for a position that I really liked. A recruiter (employee of the company) who use to work for the company contacted me for the position. My interview process ended after first phone interview and I was not provided any feedback as to why I didn't advanced to the next level. Since then I have been preparing myself for similar positions and have been doing a lot of informational interview. I feel now I am better prepared for such interviews. Now, a very similar position opened again in the same company few weeks back and I want to reapply for the position. Question: I am thinking to again contact the same recruiter (I verified that he/she is working for the same department/company) and expressing my interest again for the position. Is there anything else I should do (or NOT do) when I am contacting a recruiter for reconsidering me for the position? I don't want to say (or not say) something that would blow my chances away. 

I've been advised that, if you take non-FMLA leave in conjunction with FMLA leave or if you leave the company while on FMLA leave, the leave may then be considered as non-FMLA, and that it's best to come back at least for one day in order to officially end your FMLA leave and process all your paperwork before any of that other stuff. If you're talking about parental leave given by your company that's not covered under FMLA, it'll depend entirely on your company's policies. 

I would definitely avoid trying to read some meaning into this relating to your performance in your work. If someone's trying to send you messages this way and it's the first you've heard of it, your workplace has much bigger problems than employee social events. 

An individual BCCing anything to the whole company about their personal lives is just not something that should be done. However, in my experience, a picture of a new baby is sent out to everybody in the office in order to accomplish two things. First, everybody's going to ask about the baby and it gets disruptive. Some people are truly interested and some people just feel obligated. The new parent either can't resist getting drawn into long conversations or gets frustrated and overwhelmed. Second, it's a much less heartless-seeming way to announce that an employee may be out of the office for a period or may have an unpredictable schedule, and plans can be shifted to compensate rather than causing all kinds of pile-ups.
