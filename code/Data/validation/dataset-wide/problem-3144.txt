This was a new idea. Traditionally, the ancients considered the ratios of the whole numbers to be the ideal proportions, as described in Plato's Timaeus and detailed by Vitruvius. Le Corbusier, however, was probably channeling Hambridge and Cook who had written several years before him. Note that many sources mention the mathematician Mark Barr as originally making the association to Phidias, but this is purely apocryphal because Barr never published any such thing, and the only one who ever claimed that it was Barr's idea was Cook in his book Curves of Life, who may have just made this completely unsupported remark about Barr to give credence to his own ideas. 

Finally, the third basic method was to use a jar. If the jar was glazed and sealed it was a good way to keep the scroll dry, which was a big factor because Roman houses were pretty wet and papyrus tends to degrade rapidly in moist climates. Jars were also a lot cheaper than bookshelves, so for a middle class person, they were the obvious choice. 

There were three common methods. The first and most common was to use a diploma which is two boards sandwiched together with leather thongs. Papyrus is very fragile, so if you had something valuable written down you needed a binder like this to protect it. Also, writing can be done right on the boards themselves, not even using paper. Many diplomas had wax on them, so you could erase them, but obviously you would not do this for a legal contract. The second method is to use a cubby. The paper was rolled up and placed in a square compartment. So, you would have a matrix of boards making lots of small 3-4 inch cubbies. Normally this would only be done by somebody who was pretty rich. Essentially it is a bookshelf for scrolls. Note that one scroll can be pasted onto another one. So, if a business man had a lot of accounts he can just keep pasting onto a scroll and it gets longer and longer. So, a businessman might have one cubby for each thing, store, property, ship, whatever. The scroll having the records for that entity is kept in its own cubby. In other cases scrolls would just be stacked up on each other on a plain shelf, as in this rendering of a relief dated to the time of Constantine (4th century): 

Imperial Rescript on the Termination of the War issued by the Chrysanthemum Throne on August 14, 1945. 

The reason is that it mimics the way you would kill someone else most efficiently. The other answer saying disembowlment is "drawn out process" is true, but you don't disembowel them. Seppuku is not disembowlment. To explain... First of all, the fastest way to kill someone easily with a sword is by slicing through the solar plexus. A large artery, called the abdominal aorta, runs longitudinally through the solar plexus. Severing this artery will cause a large decrease in blood pressure and put the person into shock almost immediately. Also, the solar plexus is a nervous junction. Severing it will generally cause an instant paralysis. Finally, just beyond the solar plexus is the diaphram, so at the same time you can flood the diaphram with blood, preventing any further breathing. In general, a cut of this type will instantly incapacitate the person (which is what is wanted) and they will be unconscious within less than 30 seconds usually, and completely dead within 5 minutes. Killing in this way is a much easier stroke than a decapitation (the next best option), and can be done at longer range. Proper seppuku simply imitates this stroke. It is difficult to do because once the bushi cuts into the solar plexus he will become instantly incapacitated. For this reason the cut must be instantaneous and decisive. Any hesitation whatsoever will cause a failure. Because of the difficulty of making this cut properly, often a less experienced warrior would cut at the navel below the solar plexus, more of a "disembowlment", however as long as the bushi severs the abdominal aorta, death will follow rapidly. The purpose of simultaneous decapitation by an aide is to prevent the bushi from involuntarily crying out--a dishonor. The aide must cut off the head at the exact instant the cut is made, otherwise the bushi may make a sound. Below is illustrated the two possible cuts, the upper one being the correct and proper one, although more difficult to execute. 

The Irish style was developed in Irish monasteries and spread throughout Europe as those monks moved around (see the book, "How the Irish Saved Civilization" for more info). This style is characterized by what we call a "lower case" letter, with very large ornamental letters at the beginning of chapters. Roman writing was used for civil purposes: book keeping, laws, property records. Irish writing was used for literature, religious writing and scholarship. When printing developed at the end of 15th century what happened was that there was a merger of these two styles. Roman letters became "capitals" and Irish letters became "lower case". Case refers to the boxes with printing type as it is kept at a desk. As litlnemo says, there was no set method for combining the two styles. Different printers did whatever seemed most readable. Over time our current practice eventually evolved. 

The "disease" explanation is, as you surmise, considerably exaggerated. The major factor in such warfare is military prowess, determination, organization, and logistics. If you are interested in understanding why the conquest was possible I would recommend starting with the Mexican conquest, rather than the North American one, because the comparisons and events were more stark. One of the best books to read is the biography of Hernando Cortes written by Bernal Diaz de Castillo, one of his lieutenants. Diaz lived through the entire campaign of Cort√©s and was eye witness to all the events which he describes in detail. Reading this book carefully will give a sharp picture of the ways the European conquistadores were able to overcome the native Americans. For me the central episode in this book and the critical one is in the first battle against the Tlaxcalans which occurred in 1519. The account of the battle in which 120 Spaniards fought against thousands of Tlaxcalans is incredible. The men were fighting literally knee deep in blood. I am not exaggerating. The blood was pooled up to their knees. I have read the account of this battle many times to try to understand it fully. If you do the same, you will start to understand not only how the conquest was possible, but how any man defeats another in war and why. 

In the way of clarification, the tradition concerning this post pertains to the Gaels, who are one specific ethnic invader of Ireland (there were many others). According to the Gaels they are "Feeny" meaning Phoenicians who originated in the Levant. They travelled first to Egypt (where they were guests), then to an island in the Mediterranean (Crete?), then to North Africa (Carthage), then to Spain (Galicia), then finally to Ireland and Britain where they invaded and settled. This occurred, according to them, in approximately 1500 B.C. (the invasion of Ireland). One evidence that this tradition is fundamentally true is the similarity of the Phoenician language and ancient Gaelic. For example, in both languages the language for a citadel or fortress is "Kathair" which is often abbreviated to "kair" (for example, Carthage). Another example is from Plautus, the Roman playwright who includes the Punic (Phoenician) language in one of his plays in which he has a Carthaginian character. The character says "palum erga dectha" which means "I will submit to the commands of heaven" and is identical to the phrase "Ba lion earga deacta" which means exactly the same thing in Gaelic. Another reason to suspect the migration is the worship of the same god, Bel. The pre-Christian Gaels worshipped a god to whom they sacriced and called "Bel" (pronounced "bale" like Christian Bale) which is exactly the same name as the god of the Phoenicians, which is often spelled "Baal" and is pronounced the same way. Believe it or not this god is still celebrated today in Ireland in the holiday called "Beltane" and you can attend Beltane celebrations if you travel to Ireland in early May. As far as Egyptian culture which the Phoenicians may have transported to Ireland there are several interesting connections. One is the use of bagpipes. Another is the wearing of kilts. 

The determinative (the guy with the stick) is the symbol you will usually see associated with words involving soldiers or fighting. 

You are asking to prove a negative here which is not really possible. Who knows what was rattling around in Hitler's brain? Just because a bunch of clowns in the OSS found some blueprints in one of his desks doesn't prove he was plotting to take over Nebraska. Hitler was an architecture freak who spent hours going over the details of buildings with Speer, his lead architect. He had lots of blueprints. There is nothing in either of Speer's two books about Hitler plotting to move the capital of the Third Reich to Nebraska, nor is there any such thing that I know of in the Tischensprach either (although I have not read the whole Tischensprach). The idea that Hitler, a fanatic German nationalist, would move the capital out of Germany is not logical in any way. Moreover, Hitler had plans to build a gigantic super city, called Welthauptstadt Germania (in GERMANY obviously) which featured a huge 950-foot building, called the Volkshalle, so big you could fit the great pyramid inside its dome. Doesn't sound like somebody getting ready to move to Nebraska. Welthauptstadt means "world capital". 

Madagascar was already at a minimum a protectorate of France since the former queen had signed a treaty ceding control of the island to the French. Subsequent to this, a rebellion started against the French. Ratsimamanga was accused of conspiring with the rebels--a capital offense. 

The ship depicted in the relief is a warship, not a trading vessel. Notice the soldiers positioned on the upper deck. The round things are shields. I think the fishes and the crab are not there to suggest the sailors were eating those things. They are decorations meant to indicate the sea. It is common for scenes involving the sea to depict various sea creatures. Any kind of mission-oriented ship, whether a warship or a trading vessel will not dally to fish. They must carry all the food and water for their journey. When they need more food, they must put into port to buy it. If the ship is in some unknown land the normal procedure is to put ashore and try to find local people with whom to barter for food and water. 

Before and during the war Germany was officially what was known as the "German Confederation", a republic of many different independent states. The loss of the war completely destroyed the confederation. What happened is that the army stopped fighting the Allies and attacked and invaded all the different principalities of Germany, which were all mutinying, and forced them at gunpoint to join the "Weimar Republic". The Weimar Republic thus was a civilian instrument of the armed forces of Germany, essentially a Prussian organization. For example, in Hamburg, which before the war was a free city, one of three in Germany, starvation and unrest resulted in a Communist coup. An organization called the "Council of Workmen and Soldiers" seized power. This organization was composed of Communist agitators and deserters from the German army and navy. They established a dictatorship over Hamburg and proposed forming a new state which they called "Great Hamburg". They proposed attacking and invading nearby areas to create the so-called "Great Hamburg". One of these areas, called Cuxhaven, had been taken over in a coup by Sparticists, a form of radical, violent Communists. Hamburg absorbed them. The German army, which was Prussian-dominated, reacted to these events by invading and putting under martial law all the different states. For example, among the free cities, Bremen, which had also gone over to a Communist dictatorshop, was first to be attacked and invaded. When the "Council of Workmen and Soldiers" in Hamburg saw this at first they determined to fight and actually started trying to collect weapons as though they would have a battle against the army, but when the first troops showed up it was clear they would have no chance, so they capitulated. In the same way all the principalities of Germany were forced into the Weimar Republic. In most cases all the nobility had already been deposed by various radical Communist mutineers before the army even got there, but in those cases in which the local monarch still rule, the army deposed them and forced their state into the Weimar Republic. For example, in Bavaria, a Socialist political party seized power and declared the "Free State of Bavaria", which was more like a communist dictatorship than a free state. The former King of Bavaria, Ludwig III and his entire family had to flee for their lives.
