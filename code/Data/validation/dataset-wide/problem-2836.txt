This is an accident (also known as "destroying the exception"). An accident is a deductive fallacy in which one ignores the existence of exceptions, and thus obtains a faulty conclusion. As Ryder notes, the first one isn't a fallacy, as stated, but a slightly loaded question. The appropriate answer is "Yes, in the case of this road, driving at night is safer than driving during business hours". For the other two, they are good examples of an accident. The example given on wikipedia is another one, which concludes that surgeons are criminals because cutting people with knives is a criminal act and surgeons cut people with knives... ignoring that there are exceptions in which cutting a person with a knife is not a criminal act. 

Science doesn't assume that the laws of science hold all of the time, in every part of the universe. However, evidence has been collected suggesting that the laws seem to apply within the visible universe - motions of bodies seem to follow the laws of motion, light emissions from distant stars seem to have signatures that align with those of nearby stars (including the sun), which also match those of various chemicals on earth, after allowing for redshift, which is also consistent with our "local" laws. However, should a celestial body be found with a signature inconsistent with what we have found, or should a body move in a manner inconsistent with our motion laws, or other such inconsistencies are found, science will update to account for this, and start investigating why this might be. The existing conclusion, that the laws we have found are "universal", will be replaced, either by determining new laws, or by accepting our local laws as only "local". 

It is my view that the confusion, here, lies in a mixing of different uses of the word "belief". We use it both to refer to faith, and to refer to current understandings and viewpoints. Faith is taking something to be true in the absence of evidence. Viewpoints are more like hypotheses, and understandings come from evidence. As such, when someone is described as having a "belief in science", what they are usually saying is that they have the viewpoint that science is an effective method of obtaining information. They are not saying that, if science says something, it must be true - that is, they aren't saying they have faith in science. Note that there are exceptions - those who have true faith in science. Those who have belief in science generally accept the conclusions arrive at via the scientific method. The use, here, of the word "accept" is important. Should evidence come forward that contradicts the accepted conclusions, then those who have belief in science generally accept the new conclusion in place of the old one. You assert 

Again, this confuses conclusion with faith. The big bang theory was speculated based on various theories that apply today. From this theory, they then developed predictions about things that had not been observed (because nobody had yet looked), but that should exist if the theory is correct. For instance, residual background radiation from the bang itself. Observations then found what was expected, or at least close enough to support the theory. And yet, science has a principle, coming from statistics, that nothing can truly be "proven" based on evidence. Instead, the evidence is simply of greater and greater weight as more of it builds up. And even then, if science can't directly confirm something, there is always consideration of alternatives. We can't directly observe the big bang, and thus there are many different variations of it, all of which are consistent with observations. And even if we ignore those variations, the question of what came before the big bang is very much an open one. Some, such as Stephen Hawking, think that the question of "before the big bang" is meaningless, that time itself began then. Others think that the universe oscillates (see "Oscillating Universe Theory"). And others believe that the time before the big bang had different physical laws. Some believe the universe is embedded in a greater universe, and that the big bang was merely the start of the substance of our universe, not the universe itself. Most, I would say, do not "believe" anything regarding it, considering it to be an unanswered, and likely unanswerable question. Science does not seek to explain why the universe behaves the way that it does, only how. And for this reason, it can't really be considered a "belief system". It is rooted in the scientific method, which is a process. Let me put it another way. If one were to create an analogy with religion, science wouldn't be the belief in god, it would be the meditation, or otherwise altered state, used to seek answers. Notice that meditation can be used by atheists just as easily as by anyone else - there is no inherent faith or belief tied to the meditation itself. There are certainly some people who could be described as having "faith in science" - that is, rejecting anything that does not fit within science immediately, not as "unknown", but as "wrong". Richard Dawkins is a classic example of this. However, believing in science is not the same as this. And even those with faith in science can't be said to be following a form of theism, because that would require a faith in the results, not in the process. Those with a faith in science would alter their view of the world if it were discovered tomorrow, by scientific techniques, that the apparent patterns of our world are merely happenstance, that even the imperfect laws of quantum mechanics were far more strict than the universe really is, that our apparent reality was nothing more than a massive coincidence of randomness. Their faith is in the method, not the conclusions, and believe that information obtained by other methods is necessarily untrustworthy (thus the disbelief in gods, which lie outside of the realm of science). 

To answer "What is universe for?", you have to answer "Why does universe exist?" or to be more philosophical "Why is there something instead of nothing?" No matter how one will want to answer this last question, one would have to appeal, at least implicitly, to that which exists (or to what supposedly exists). Otherwise, one would put himself in the dubious position of assuming that the appeal to non-existence somehow explains existence. (The trend in philosophy since Plato, and perhaps long before him, is to posit some form of consciousness as the “answer” to such questions, even though this tactic is irrescindably incoherent.) Thus, by posing this question and assuming that it is valid, you implicitly (but unavoidably) commits yourself to the fallacy of the stolen concept. If we ask why something is, but simply turn around and posit that something in our explanation of that something, what mileage have we gained? Indeed, we’re back to where we started, yet we don’t admit it to ourselves. This is what you do in assuming that the question “Why is there something rather than nothing?” (or “Why does existence exist?”) is a valid question. One will have to assume the fact of existence in order to answer the question. But in so doing, he will have to deny the fact of existence in order to validate his assumption that there must be a reason why there is something rather than nothing. He must assume the very concept his argument wants to deny, thus ‘stealing’ it from the objective hierarchy of knowledge, and rendering invalid any conclusion he hopes to draw from his argument. Existence exists. We must start somewhere. The theist wants to start with a form of consciousness. He wants to posit a mind (albeit supernatural) which is responsible for creating all its objects. This is called metaphysical subjectivism, a view which holds that existence finds its source in a form of consciousness. Some may object to my characterization of the question “Why is there something rather than nothing?” as fallacious, contesting that there is no such thing as a fallacious question. However, it is true when we examine issues in epistemology and logic, that there is a such thing as an invalid question. The fallacy known as ‘complex question‘, for instance, is a species of invalid question. It is a question which operates on a false assumption and expects the reader to accept that false assumption in order to answer it. The typical example is the question “Have you stopped beating your wife?” The question assumes that one is a married man and that he beats or has beaten his wife; indeed, it implies such beatings are a regular occurrence. Contrary to these assumptions, however, it could be the case a) that he is not married, or b) that he is married but has never beaten his wife. Since the question is asked in a manner in which a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ response can be the only appropriate reply, one cannot answer it on its own terms and avoid affirming its erroneous premises. One would implicate himself simply by answering. The question is fallacious because it leads one to accept a false premise, assuming either a) or b) are the actual case, if he should choose to take it seriously. Likewise, a question which leads one to commit a fallacy in order to answer it is also invalid. If taken seriously, the question “Why is there something rather than nothing?” will lead one to commit the fallacy of the stolen concept; indeed, the fallacy of the stolen concept is unavoidable on the question’s own terms, as we saw above. One would have both to assume and deny existence in order to address the question. If Martin Heidegger ,who originally asked this question, did not recognize this, it was principally because he was not operating on a fully rational philosophy. Yet, today we have theists assuming this question is valid all the time in the construction of their apologetic ruses. What is it that theists want to posit in response to their invalid questions so as to appear to satisfy them? Of course, they assume that the only logical answer is to assert a universe-creating, reality-ruling form of consciousness, which they call God, and delight themselves with this as their answer, never allowing themselves to recognize that the question leads them to accepting a stolen concept, and assuming that their arguments justifying this illicit move make it valid. 

The idea that it exists to strengthen the patriarchy is silly; the concept of fatherhood directly benefits the female vastly more than the male. According to evolution, it likely came about as a consequence of human's extended childhood. Because of the immense amount of resources that a human child requires, and the fact that a human woman is very limited in the number of children she can have in her lifetime, her mating strategy necessarily becomes primarily about picking a male who can share that burden...providing and protecting the child. Both males and females 'want' (in the Darwinian sense) to continue their bloodline. Males can become a father with very little investment, but children who have a father who invested in them are far more likely to survive and prosper, and are more likely to have children who do the same. Mothers who select fathers that do so are also more likely to have surviving descendants. This doesn't really address the purely ethical considerations of fatherhood; that's a philosophical question that depends on what ethical structure you have adopted. I'd say that most ethical frameworks have a conception of responsibility, though, which describes half of fatherhood... and of maximizing happiness, which is the other half. Men who haven't raised children are missing a fundamental joy in life, like men who haven't fallen in love or never appreciated art. 

"He seems to believe that a man has something more than just a brain, he thinks that there is something more in there and not just experiences" It's odd, isn't it, that otherwise rational men believe that sort of thing? I think the reason they do is twofold: One is that the brain (and mind) is a chaotic system; while it is deterministic, there is no way to predict what its future state will be. You have to wait and see. So, it is unpredictable, but not random... which gives a fairly rough description of what free will FEELS like. It seems self-evident that we aren't making RANDOM decisions, but also self-evident that we are MAKING decisions, not following a predetermined script. The solution in the past has been to say that we do not behave in a way either random or predetermined, but some ill-defined third option, generally due to the influence of some preternatural force (soul, essence, or some other evasive concept.) Secondly, there are huge but inevitable problems with perspective. When we start to reason or do science about ourselves, particularly our own consciousness or perceptions, it sometimes gets very tricky. We see this in philosophical problems of free will, solipsism, idealism, etc., and in scientific problems dealing with quantum mechanics, the anthropic principle, biological definitions of life, and so on. It's harder to reason about a problem when you are, yourself, a fundamental component of the equation. 

First, Objectivist principles are intended to be rational guidelines for maximizing long-term happiness. Accidents and emergencies are, by definition, exceptional events, and behavioral principles aren't always applicable. Secondly, Objectivism is against altruism in the sense of an obligation to sacrifice to others. It isn't globally opposed to acts of kindness or charity. The traditional objectivist answer to the question is that an Objectivist bystander should make as well-informed assessment of the risk of providing aid, compared to the value the other's life holds in relation to the objectivist, and act accordingly. This judgement can't be made by anybody other than the individual, because only they know their values. An objectivist who is drowning would call for help, in the hope that others would save him (i.e., believe that the drowner's value is worth the risk). It would be wrong for the drowner to believe that the bystanders had a moral duty to risk death to save him, but not wrong at all for him to appeal for freely given assistance. Personally, I think that a practical objectivist incorporates a little bit of game theory into their behavior, and knows that a some minor assistance to others as a general rule can grease the spokes of society... again, as long as it's freely given and reciprocal.
