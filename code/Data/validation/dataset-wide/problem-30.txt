Cattle used for "fluoride brainwashing" So... you wish to brainwash your populace via use of a chemical that we'll alludingly call a "fluoride". Except... you don't have a way to "fluoridize" the central water supply in 1700s the way you do in 1800s. Nor can you poison every farmer's plants. BUT... you CAN more readily disperse the chemical to the cattle! (I can offer specific ways but that'd be a separate question :) So, to ensure people don't avoid the brainwashing, we are prohibiting vegetarianism. Probably, along with hunting wild animals. 

NOTE: I would prefer answers based on real research into religions and psychology. But you don't have to be limited to that. 

QUESTION: Howe would religions develop on such a world, where everyone's predisposed to believe in hallucinations over supernatural by their own experience? Would it be a world that is nearly 100% atheistic? Or specific religion types (Buddhism/Taoism?) would dominate? For the purposes of this question, it doesn't matter if a deity exists or not; but if a deity exists, their ability to do things is such that 100% of the effect they produced can be explained away as a hallucination. 

"Andromeda"'s "Slipstream" approach. Your FTL technology relies on slipstream that can only be navigated by a human pilot. Obviously stolen from Gene Rodenberry's "Andromeda" show. 

A person died long ago and their soul went to Heaven/Hell/Some ethereal plane. Somehow after years of struggle they find an escape back to the Material World. What allows that soul to have a new material body? Is it created somehow? Can it only possess another body? The world in question has magic to some extent, tho its very scientific. I want to avoid simply saying "Magic" or "Just because". Ideally it will be the "same" body as before death as far as looks and so on, but I'm not opposed a very clever possession or something. 

We couldn't use Jupiter's gravity as it stands without moving something. If you can move Jupiter, you can move Earth, or even better still the asteroid in question, so there wouldn't be any reason for it. Using mass to move other things via gravity is possible however. It's actually one of our plans in case we do need to move some space rocks out of our way. They call this a gravity tractor. 

Yes, there would be different cultures. Other factors would cause the cultures to diverge, like climate, flora, and fauna. Some parts of your continent will be hot, others cold, and others will have seasons. Living in a desert vs living in remote mountains of lush forests vs vast plains. Dealing with dangerous wildlife, or abundant fishing or simple lack of any real animals to hunt or raise. All these would affect how the people of that area live and how their culture develops. Natural barriers would also cause people to develop different and remain different. Large mountain ranges, massive dense forests or deadly deserts will all keep people isolated and developing their own cultures that may not mix. Assuming the rest of the world is ocean, the people by the water would develop maritime lifestyles with a bit more freedom to travel around. 

5. Reduce suffering from poverty, to prevent unrest and revolts by the people who have little to lose and safety and stability to gain. See pretty much any revolution or uprising you can think of as examples. While at setting up philantropy, set up social safety nets to keep the less-productive sheeple content. Some sort of weak Basic Income Guarantee is not out of realm of impossible for a good developed Imperial economy (fed by the income from Free Enterprise Zones), and can be designed to balance avoiding extreme poverty with avoiding bankrupting the Treasury. Also, ensure entertainment. Nothing to distract people from attending revolutionary meetings like a good round of Kardashian admiration, or gladiatorial games, or dances. 

For more details on motivated reasoning, I would recommend a recent series of episodes on "You're not so smart" podcast. People with high IQ are not guaranteed to be experts at picking political leaders. So, in representative democracy (instead of direct issue voting) IQ is not that relevant. Even assuming the (wholly incorrect, as per previous point) assumption that somehow, high IQ can lead to "correct" positions being taken by voters, that doesn't translate into picking "correct" politicians. Obama hoodwinked a whole lotta progressives (including high-IQ ones) into thinking he'll establish their utopia (as well as whole lotta conservatives afraid of the same). Instead, from him, they got TPP, Wall Street bailouts, support for Hillary over Bernie in 2016, wars in Afghanistan, Lybia and Syria; drone bombings; NSA ubiquitous spying; and more illegal deportations than under Bush. Trump hoodwinked whole lotta voters that he'll build the wall, deport tons of illegal aliens (he deported less than Obama did), drain the swamp, move the Israeli embassy to Jerusalem, repeal Obamacare, etc... So far most of the promises he made didn't pan out for his voters. I won't even go into high-IQ support for genocidal psychopaths listed in bullet #1 above. Issues that require resolving are frequently beyond understanding of any single person, even with 110 or 140 IQ; unless they spend their life studying them. Having high IQ doesn't mean you know jack U&*t about economics (as many high-IQ marxists prove). What makes you think non-economist with high IQ would be good at voting for the right people/issues when it comes to economics? 

I would agree with the 1960s-tech assessment: you don't just need steel, you need high quality, lightweight, high strength steel, etc. You can, however, give your natives a leg up in the non-tech areas. One suggestion that comes to mind is an extremely high mountain range that extends well beyond the atmosphere. Not only would this give them experience with airlessness, it would also provide a useful launch platform -- assuming they could move all the required natives and equipment into such a deadly area. But space is difficult and requires a long learning curve -- read up on the ongoing space programs all over the world; even with the knowledge and technology, the secret sauce is experience and perhaps failure. What about the natives would make them good spacefarers? One example would be if they were squishy enough to survive being shot out of a cannon. This would also have war implications -- if you could shoot an army over a wall, how would fortifications and weapons be different? A plus is that it's not a stretch to start shooting natives straight up; a minus is the plausibility of a body that can survive hundreds of gees. 

Although I favor the artificial genetic reservoir idea myself (Ergo Proxy springs to mind), there is also the Planet of the Apes idea wherein time and/or space travellers return to earth and end up re-colonizing. I think there is more fun to be had by playing with conventional expectations of "human" -- for example, a "tall man" today is different from a tall man of just two hundred years ago -- so what sort of expectations would mean "human" to an observer? 

Plant based alternatives are an issue. To have a sustainable vegetarian diet, you need access to plant based protein - legumes, avocado, etc... If that requirement is a problem, that's the root of prohibition on veganism (non-vegan vegetarianism is not affected as they can use milk or eggs). E.g.: 

Engage the services of media makers. Producers, film directors. As with #2, the approach #1 helps you win points with them. Have them make propaganda movies that paint you in good light. Cuba successfully did that with Michael Moore. 

Economic unrest. New enterprising rich types clashing with existing power structures. Think French Revolution, or February 1917 revolution in Russia. Set up "economic free zones" for enterprising types. Less regulation, more law and order. Make it easy to move to/from there This has the added benefit of keeping your country economically vibrant and viable, without bleeding those enterprising types out of gene pool through immigration or tyrannical suppression. Lack of law and order. Set up "frontiers" to keep the rough, the tough, the footloose and the risk-takers busy. Ideally, far away so they aren't tempted to return to stir up trouble, only to retire. That will productively channel and/or isolate most of your psychopath types, or even regular destabilizing people. Seasteading. Space. Raiding neighbours. Desire to improve the life of the "oppressed". See, Russian Revolution, or Occupy iPhones, or whatnot. Most of those aren't actually dissent from the oppressed, but from people who are higher up the social chain, caring about said oppressed. Set up philantropy and "for the common good" programs to keep the bleeding hearts happy and busy. Very few people want a bloody revolution, if the alternative to better life for others is Habitat for Humanity type work - especially if it's effective and efficacious. Unrest and revolts by the people who have little to lose and safety and stability to gain. Let's cover that in detail in next topic
