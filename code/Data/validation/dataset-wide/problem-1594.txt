I believe that if the claim is tweaked slightly, there is some evidence to support it. Originally it says "born without wisdom teeth", which to me sounds like they are missing all of their wisdom teeth. I haven't seen any studies that show that high a rate for that. Also, I believe everybody is "born" without them, since they generally don't start forming until age ten or so. If it's changed to "will not develop one or more wisdom teeth", that's a bit easier to find support for. While this study was mainly looking at specific ethnic variations, they also include a table showing various studies done from 1954 to 2010: 

This doesn't clearly say what time period/method they use to get the "baseline trend", so it's hard to give a precise figure, but it's clear that they're adjusting for some sort of previous trend. They also note that the major gains were in demographics consistent with the predicted effects of the law: 

but it claims that he was nominated in 1995, and lists different supporters. This is not to say that both couldn't be true, but I don't believe you're going to find hard evidence either way. 

The "Prevalence" column shows the rate where one or more third molars (wisdom teeth) are missing. You can see that only one of them (Lee et al, 2009) tops 35%, but there are several that get somewhat close. So even if 35% is a bit high, it's probably correct to say "One estimate says..." 

"We as humans only started eating large amounts of carbs when we got into agriculture. Even then, it's only in the last 100 years we started to put them (including sugar) into everything in large amounts." Humans have been consuming carbohydrates well into the Paleolithic. A method known as "starch grain analysis" has been able to recover all kinds of carbohydrate residue on the teeth of paleolithic humans. Some good papers in this field are Changes in starch grain morphologies from cooking and Microfossils in calculus demonstrate consumption of plants and cooked foods in Neanderthal diets (Shanidar III, Iraq; Spy I and II, Belgium). Evidence for mortar/pestle-like starch grinding dates back 30,000 years. Furthermore, almost all the "hunter-gatherer" cultures featured in paleo diet books are not hunter-gatherers, but horticulturalists like the Kitavans (or trade with horticulturalists like the Pygmies) who get most of their calories from starch. The !Kung and other related cultures are almost pure foragers, but they gather honey quite often, braving great danger to acquire it. So while evidence is spotty, I don't think there is any way we can say our ancestors ate a low-carb diet. I cannot comment as extensively on the insulin driving fat storage since this is not my area of study, but I will say it's a perfect example of how you can build a story that looks and sounds scientifically sound by selectively referencing studies. I was initially swayed by Taube's book, particularly since I lost weight on that diet, but since then I have added carbohydrates back in and now eat a mainly carbohydrate diet and have not re-gained. My friend Dr. Stephan Guyenet has a few articles skeptical of the insulin=fat idea that are very good and extensively reference. He also works in that field: Insulin and Obesity: Another Nail in the Coffin, 3 part series on the carbohydrate hypothesis. Why then do diseases of civilization seem to track with the adoption of refined carbohydrates? We need to look for other mechanisms such as hyperpalatibility, lack of fiber that modulates inflammation via SCFA, LPS-induced inflammation, and other factors. 

Recently I saw a commercial for Centrum that claims you can see the light of a single candle from ten miles away. I was skeptical, but a trip to the internet claims that not only is that true, but you could actually see it from 30 miles away. Most of what I found simply repeated that claim (some had varying numbers, but in the 10-30 range) with nothing to back it up. One page detailed it a bit better, by giving some basic math based on the number of photons it takes to register a light in the eye. However, they still don't link to anything solid IMO. Obviously these numbers assume line-of-sight, since any distance over a few miles would be blocked by the horizon if on the Earth's surface. I also assume that "the light from a single candle" means roughly one candela, but nobody cares enough to clarify that I could find. The main reason I'm skeptical is because I've seen ceremonial (small) bonfires on mountains a few miles away. Even with a much larger light and closer distance, they're pretty faint. Is there any empirical evidence that human eyes can see a light source that small from that distance? This seems like a simple thing for people to test. 

The Hamilton Depression Scale and the Numerical Description of the Symptoms of Depression In recent years it has been criticized in several published papers, notably The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale: Has the Gold Standard Become a Lead Weight? A particularly pointed passage: 

According to this gas station, pumping gasoline into more than one vehicle is a serious safety hazard: 

Apparently, yes. The same study seems to be discussed here in a radio format. A predecesor group, from Stanford, saw the same thing (see TED talk here.) At first glance, another separate demonstration of this seems to be described here. The mechanism by which this works is not yet understood, but the effect seems to be real. 

The gas station making this claim charges different customers different prices per gallon depending on their level of activity as reflected in database records accessed by their loyalty cards. Quora indicates that the gas station's claim is bunk intended to increase profits, but answers there don't cite any authoritative source or skirt around the core question, regarding the accuracy of the claim. I have seen this claim repeated at various gas stations, but not all. Also, this much more extensive safety guide from Shell (thanks to a now-deleted answer for the link) mentions nothing about double-pumping or filling multiple vehicles, though it covers other minor hazards like "don't use the inner pumps" when filling a truck to avoid obstructing a sales associate's view of farther pumps. To me, a single customer filling two vehicles instead of one doesn't seem to be different from normal operations when the gas station is busy, except for the loyalty card/price and payment method not changing between two sequential vehicles. I don't see how that poses a fire hazard, and think that false claims of safety hazards for profit leads people to ignore (or be less likely to view as credible) legitimate safety warnings on other occasions. However, the gas station is explicitly claiming that safety hazard is real - is there something to it? 

So while I do believe that the results published in the study are accurate, it's hard to tell if they're meaningful. 

The study that's from goes on to examine specific mutations in the PAX9 gene and their effects relating to dentition, in case you're interested. Note that it doesn't say "they will disappear", just that their formation is based on an inheritable trait. It could go either way from here, as always. 

In summary, it looks like HuffPo did what most journalists do: Take a single number/soundbite from a paper and report it. There are confounding factors, and the number quoted is jut an estimate, but it's clear they have taken a lot into consideration. It's not just a WAG. 

It's possible that there is some clown-specific law that I've missed, but it's likely referring to a more general ban against masks and related means of concealing your identity: From Reuters: 

The evolutionary aspect is trickier, but it's clear that the trait is inheritable. Sampling shows that it varies tremendously by ethnicity: 

Of course, people suck at rules, so there are naturally anecdotes about who was nominated. The problem then is sorting that out from the wild speculation that also happens. The sources given by Wikipedia are in Italian, so I can't assess their accuracy very well. I found another source: 

According to Dr Joe Vinson, yes, or at least it was in 2005. I can't find an online text of the study, but it's reported/recapped in many places. I haven't seen a newer study that directly measures antioxidants in the US diet.
