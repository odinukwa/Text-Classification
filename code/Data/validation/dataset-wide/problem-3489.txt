The stock of capital in the RBC model is a predetermined state variable, meaning that the capital $K_t$ available at time $t$ was determined at time $t-1$. Usually we have an accumulation relation of the form $$K_t = I_{t-1}+(1-\delta)K_{t-1}$$ When solving an RBC model starting at time $t=0$, we must exogenously assume some initial capital stock $K_0>0$ to get the model started, since we don't explicitly consider what happened at time $t=-1$. Labor, on the other hand, generally is not specified ahead of time. Instead, in many RBC models the household has an exogenous certain time endowment, perhaps normalized to 1, and then "leisure" $L_t=1-N_t$ is the amount of time remaining after "labor" $N_t$. Leisure then enters into the utility function just like consumption. (An equivalent and common alternative is to directly put labor $N_t$ as a "bad" into the utility function.) The basic contrast is that capital is a stock while labor is a flow. We can choose the level of investment flow $I_t$ in each period, and the stock $K_t$ (which we can no longer control once we've reached time $t$) reflects the accumulation of past investment flows $$K_t = \sum_{s=0}^\infty (1-\delta)^s I_{t-s-1}$$ Meanwhile, labor $N_t$ is a flow that the household can choose optimally at time $t$. Things becomes more complicated in a model with either (A) human capital or (B) search frictions. With (A) human capital, the effective supply of labor is partly a stock, since it reflects past flow investments in human capital; whereas with (B), the number of ongoing employer-employee relationship is a stock that reflects accumulated matches. Neither of these are present in the baseline RBC model, however. Instead, the baseline RBC model is essentially the Ramsey growth model augmented with a stochastic process for TFP and endogenous labor supply. In this model, capital $K_t$ is the only endogenous linkage between periods. 

Yes. In the core New Keynesian model in GalÃ­, it is possible for the aggregate profits of intermediate good producers to be zero or negative; and it is even more likely that the profits of individual intermediate good producers, who may be stuck at prices far from the optimum, will be negative. Since it's easier to characterize the aggregate, I'll discuss the conditions there. Note that the aggregate profits of intermediate good producers are just aggregate revenues minus the aggregate wage bill, or $$\Pi =PY-WN$$ where $P$ is the aggregate price index, $Y$ is aggregate output, $W$ is the nominal wage (common to all producers thanks to the competitive labor market) and $N$ is aggregate labor input. Now, consider the special case where intermediate producers have constant returns to scale and productivity is normalized to 1. There we have, to first order, $Y\approx N$ (there is a second order difference due to price dispersion). Hence, again to first order, we have $$\Pi \leq 0 \Longleftrightarrow P\leq W$$ When is $P\leq W$? Well, using lowercase variables to denote logs, we know from household optimization that $w - p = \sigma c + \varphi n$ (see Gali p.43 equation (2), for instance), where $\sigma$ is the inverse EIS and $\varphi$ is the inverse Frisch elasticity. And since market clearing and our simple production function imply that $y=c=n$ to first order, this becomes $$w-p = (\sigma + \varphi)y$$ Finally, we observe that at the "natural level" of output $y^n$, markups should equal their desired level, which is $\mathcal{M}=\varepsilon/(\varepsilon-1)$, where $\varepsilon$ is the elasticity of firm demand. Writing $\mu =\log \mathcal{M}$ and substituting into the equation for $w-p$, this implies $-\mu=(\sigma+\varphi)y^n$. Finally, subtracting from the equation for $w-p$, we have $$w-p = (\sigma+\varphi)(y-y^n) - \mu$$ We'll have negative aggregate profits $P\leq W \Longleftrightarrow w-p \geq 0$ when $(\sigma+\varphi)(y-y^n) \geq \mu$. Note that this happens when output is high, since profits in the basic NK model are countercyclical. Interestingly, under some not-totally-crazy calibrations this can happen. For instance, if we assume that both the EIS and Frisch are 1/2, so that $\sigma=\varphi=2$, and also assume $\varepsilon = 10$, so that $\mu = 0.105$, then exceeding the natural level of output by even 3% is enough to deliver negative aggregate profits, since $4\times 0.03 > 0.105$. And again, note that it is much more likely that we'll have individual firms with negative profits; in the case where aggregate profits are even close to negative, any firm unlucky enough to be stuck at a much lower-than-average price will have negative profits. Finally, I should clarify that all of this is unrelated to the concept of zero long-term economic profit that you mention. This concept is often embedded in models of monopolistic competition in the form of a free-entry condition (where firms pay some fixed cost ex ante to exist), but this is very rare in New Keynesian models - presumably because NK models focus on business-cycle frequencies where the entry margin is limited. 

Kenny LJ and FooBar already did a great job of clarifying the broader conceptual issue here: in equilibrium, prices don't just increase or decrease without a cause (a shift in supply or demand), and any deviation from the equilibrium price will result in a surplus or deficit. But since you're talking about interest rates, I assume that you're interested in what happens when a central bank changes the interest rate. This is legitimately very confusing, because at first glance it doesn't seem like the central bank is affecting either the supply of savings or the demand for investment - and hence, by changing the interest rate, it seems like the central bank will break the equality of savings and investment. This isn't true. But it took me years to wrap my head around this, and I suspect that the vast majority of economists would get it wrong if asked to explain it (as evinced, perhaps, that someone as smart as FooBar misfired a little on this point). Indeed, John Taylor - an extremely well-known macroeconomist - recently fell victim to a fallacy here, as Miles Kimball pointed out (see point 7 here; as further proof of the difficulty of this topic, I'm not sure that Kimball got it quite right either!). To clarify, let's split into two cases. Case 1: flexible prices. Note that what really matters for savings and investment is the real interest rate, which is the nominal interest rate minus expected inflation, while the central bank sets the nominal interest rate. Suppose that the central bank increases interest rates, and at first suppose that inflation expectations remain constant. Then as you point out, desired savings will increase while desired investment falls. This means that there will be a glut in the economy: there will be more goods supplied than demanded. How is this resolved? In a world where prices are flexible, the price will fall until inflation expectations rise exactly enough to offset the central bank's increase in the nominal interest rate, leaving the real interest rate ultimately unchanged (so that desired savings and investment balance again). For instance, if we have a certain expectation of where prices will be next year, then when prices fall today, that fall creates more expected inflation over the next year. This is the neoclassical, flexible price case, and it resolves your paradox in the simplest possible way - by saying that expected inflation will adjust such that real interest rates, and hence the desire to save and invest, are unchanged. But as you can probably guess, this is fairly unrealistic: prices don't always adjust that quickly, and it's counterfactual to say that higher nominal interest rates result in an equal rise in expected inflation. Case 2: sticky prices. Let's suppose that prices are "sticky", meaning that they don't change in response to events very quickly. This is the kind of assumption made in "New Keynesian" models (and, to some extent, "Old Keynesian" and monetarist models before them). Indeed, for our purposes, let's suppose that prices are so sticky that expected inflation is a constant, so that a change in the nominal interest rate translates exactly one-for-one to a change in the real interest rate. (This is not a bad assumption empirically, according to Nakamura and Steinsson!) This means that we can't use the dodge from before: when the central bank pushes up the nominal interest rate, the real interest rate that matters for the savings/investment market rises too, and it seems like we should get some kind of disequilibrium. Indeed, if not all sides of the market react right away, something like this might happen. Suppose that in response to an interest rate hike, consumers quickly increase their savings, cutting back consumption, but producers are slow to respond and keep producing the same amount of goods. (Let's ignore the response of desired investment to interest rates, which complicates the story but doesn't change the basic lessons.) Then there will be a surplus of unsold goods, which will accumulate as inventories. This inventory accumulation is a form of investment (e.g. line 14 in the US national accounts here), so $S=I$ will continue to hold - but it will hold in a weird way, where consumers' saving is matched by producers' unintended inventory accumulation. Alternatively, suppose that producers react right away. Then when consumers try to save more and consume less, producers will produce less, and there will be less income earned by workers and capitalists. How will consumers deal with this fall in income? Partly, they'll save less - because it makes less sense to save when your earnings are low relative to their usual level. Partly, though, they'll consume even less - which means that producers make less and incomes fall again, and so on and so on. This is just the Keynesian multiplier, and the process ends when income $Y$ has fallen by $\Delta Y = \Delta S/MPS$, where $\Delta S$ is the initial increase in desired savings and $MPS$ is the marginal propensity to save out of income. At the point, the decrease $MPS\times \Delta Y$ in desired savings from the $\Delta Y$ fall in income precisely offsets the initial increase $\Delta S$ in desired savings arising from the higher interest rate. (If there is an initial fall $\Delta I$ in investment in response to the higher interest rate too, then this becomes $\Delta Y = (\Delta S - \Delta I)/MPS$; and it becomes more complicated still if investment changes in response to income, etc..) In short, $S=I$ continues to hold because desired savings depends on income - which you can't see from the simple, partial equilibrium diagram showing S and I relative to the interest rate. Consumption (and therefore income) will eventually fall enough to cause a decline in savings that restores equilibrium. 

In general, "Ponzi schemes" in the context of asset pricing refer to "rational bubbles", or a failure of the transversality condition you need when passing from a flow identity to a present value identity. They are not "fraudulent schemes". For instance, there can be a rational bubble on a "fundamentally" worthless asset in a perfect foresight world if its price grows at the real interest rate available in the broader economy. (This is actually what you're talking about, in case it's not clear to you - each investor assumes they can offload the asset at a higher price to another investor, and you push the problem of the "greatest fool" to infinity, which makes the assumption a rational one ex post.) Is there any evidence for the existence of such rational bubbles? Cochrane (2002) points out that rational bubble theory does not account for the association of "bubbles" with high trading volume. In a rational bubble, it is rational to hold the asset in every period: there's no reason to observe high turnover along with high prices. They are also silent on the association of high prices with high volatility - in a rational bubble context, volatility (induced by shifting from one equilibrium to another) is always present, and the choice of equilibrium (the fact that we're on an explosive price path) does not produce more volatility than usual. Rational bubbles appear to be a poor explanation of events that people have historically described as "bubbles" (and of the price behavior of cryptocurrencies). In contrast, the convenience yield theory outlined in Cochrane (2002) and also in this blog post seems to fit the data much better. If "overvaluation" is driven by a liquidity premium induced by shorting constraints and a short-term constraint on supply, then we would expect to see the standard prediction of monetary economics that high prices should be associated with high turnover. In that case, overvaluation relative to "fundamentals" should also require shorting constraints - in the case of dollars vs treasuries, for instance, it's illegal to print banknotes or close substitutes to money to finance a purchase of bonds, which is a kind of shorting constraint. Indeed, shorting constraints are what we see in the cryptocurrency market: BTC futures have only recently started trading on stock exchanges, and even then the "electronic paper" that you hold when you take the long side of a BTC futures contract is not the same thing as holding BTC directly, so what appears like a possibility to short BTC through these contracts is in fact not so. (It satisfies "speculative demand", so it's possible to "bet on cryptocurrencies" without having to hold any, but it's not possible to use these contracts in the place of cryptocurrencies in transactions.) If you want to ask whether cryptocurrencies are a bubble, then you have to define what "bubble" means. If it is "overvaluation relative to fundamentals", then is USD a bubble? After all, it's trading at a premium relative to T-bills. If you include any convenience yield the asset may have in your definition of "bubble" so that USD is not one, then it's likely that cryptocurrencies are not "bubbles" either. It's very difficult to say anything about whether cryptocurrency valuations are "justified" or not by this explanation, since the convenience demand of cryptocurrencies, like of cash, has components which are not transparent. We're mostly in the dark, and I wouldn't try to outguess the market price of an asset in a circumstance where we know next to nothing about the factors which are driving the convenience demand for it. 

Habit forming models should work fine for this if you just switch the sign with which the habit enters the utility function of the consumer. The usual habit model looks something like $$ \Delta X_t = \phi (C_t - X_t) $$ with $ \phi > 0 $ where $ X_t $ is the consumer's habit at time $ t $ and $ C_t $ is consumption. Habit forming models usually take a standard utility function $ u $ and say that consumer's time $ t $ utility from consumption is given by $ u(C_t - X_t) $. For your purposes, assuming the utility from consumption at time $ t $ is given by $ u(C_t + X_t) $ will do. With multiple goods instead of one, you may specify a moving habit for each good and put each habit in the same way into the multivariate utility function. Habit models may also assume that habit formation is "external", i.e the consumer makes decisions without taking into account that consumption decisions affect the habit process. For your purposes, you want the exact opposite: the consumer should notice the effect consumption decisions have on habit formation and act accordingly. The point of this modification is that for large values of $ X_t $ it reduces the marginal utility of consumption, so (for instance) if the consumer has to work and suffer some marginal disutility to acquire income and there are no savings, they will work less in times of high $ X_t $ compared to times of low $ X_t $. If there are savings, then the consumer will still consume less in times of high $ X_t $, because the marginal utility gain from doing so is small. 

If it was not feasible, then the residents of the city would bid up the price of the services provided by the low-paying jobs until the induced rise in wages (and the fall in rents) would make housing affordable enough for people who are supposed to provide the "make the world go round" services. It's important to note that this process can't create housing units out of nothing; so the restricted supply of housing still leads to inefficiency - if no new houses are constructed, people who are dissatisfied with the lack of affordable basic services have to move out of the city until enough housing is freed up for workers who are going to provide these services. This leads to inefficient allocation of labor, etc etc. "Labor market corrections" or rent regulation don't solve the underlying problem, which is a shortage of housing units in areas which offer higher productivity to workers. Public transit could help, but how exactly do we make it "high quality"? The best way to improve the quality of public transit is probably to build more roads to alleviate traffic problems during peak times, and these construction projects usually run into the same barriers that housing construction projects do. The solution I would recommend is to reform some of the environmental regulation, zoning laws and the government's internal review processes which make it so hard to build new housing units, high-speed trains, roads, etc. If the problem is a lack of housing and transportation infrastructure, the correct response should be to remove the supply-side barriers which are contributing to the shortage.
