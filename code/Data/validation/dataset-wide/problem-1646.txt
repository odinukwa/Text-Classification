The Kennedy quote you supplied is probably from a 1977 Congressional Joint Hearing before the Select Committee on Intelligence (and a couple other committees). There doesn't seem to have been any disagreement from the CIA witnesses at that hearing that MKULTRA had been a real program, that it was larger than previously thought, and that most of the records had been destroyed in 1973. You can read the entire hearing here. Here's the passage that most directly answers your question. 

Here's the text of a Norwegian article that purports to talk a director of communications at Nike about the commercial. I can't really speak to the veracity of this article, though, and the title is certainly deceptive. 

Of course, Jay-Z would hardly be the first musician interested in the occult. Jimmy Page would be the classic example, and even in the world of hip hop Jay-Z was beaten to the punch by The JAMs (later known and The Timelords, and still later as The KLF). But the important point here is that just because some artists are interested in the occult that doesn't mean we should take that interest as evidence that there really is a worldwide conspiracy to mind control to world's population through symbolism. Real evidence for the Illuminati claim has never been presented. 

The invention of what we consider touch typing, and therefore typists who could stress the upper limits of their machines, is usually attributed to a Mr. Frank McGurren in the late 1880s. Newspaper accounts of his exploits stress that he didn't have to look at the keyboard to achieve speeds of typing on his Remington #2 that left his competitors in the dust. For example, from the New York Times of August 2nd, 1888: 

I think the key phrase in that quote from the Starchild Project is "the research team ruled out all known deformities." In fact, most independent experts think it most likely the skull is that of a child suffering from hydrocephaly. Dr. Steven Novella writes: 

The Remington #2 was the first successful typewriter, though it was still years after its 1878 introduction before it started selling in significant numbers. American Heritage, again: 

If you have any engagement with current pop culture you've heard about the impending apocalypse in 2012. The date is usually given as December 21, 2012, supposedly derived from the end of some or another Mayan calendar. My question is, who first proposed that the end of the Mayan calendar predicted the apocalypse? The first time I read about 2012 theology was in Daniel Pinchbeck's book 2012: The Return of Quetzalcoatl, but he wasn't really predicting the end of the world so much as a universal consciousness. So when did the leap to doomsday prophecy occur, and who made it? 

Edited with new information I got a copy of the book The Slaughter: An American Atrocity and had a chance to read the source of the claim. The odd thing is that the factual part of the book is only about 50 pages, including several pages of transcripts and reproductions of official documents. The rest of the book is a fictional account of a reporter investigating a fictional hate crime vaguely based on the author's own experiences. It struck me as an odd approach to such a serious accusation. Carroll Case's primary source is William "Bill" Martzall, who worked with Case. One day years ago, Case says, Martzall confessed his role in a massacre at Camp Van Dorn. Though really, the word "confessed" may be a little strong. As Case relates it, Martzall's story sounds like a race-baiting fantasy. Martzall's story starts off fairly factual, talking about how the 364th had a bad reputation from events that happened in Phoenix. Martzall says that the population of Centerville was so concerned about this influx of troublesome black soldiers (I should note that the whole account only uses the n-word to refer to them) that a local sheriff decided to kill one just to teach the others a lesson. This would appear to refer to the death of William Walker, which I'll address separately. After this, however, the story gets suspect. Martzall then says there was supposed to be a July 4th dance on base, but the black soldiers disrupted the festivities before they could start. The final straw occurred when black soldiers attacked a pregnant white woman and ripped the baby from her womb, "stomping it to jelly." That night Martzall says he was assigned to a machine gun squad that gathered the 364th into an open area on the edge of the base and killed "hundreds, maybe a thousand" black soldiers. The bodies were loaded into a train and somehow disposed of. Obviously, if a pregnant woman and an unborn child were killed in such a gruesome manner it would be big news, but no such death is associated with the 364th. I'm pretty sure that the whole later part of Martzall's story is just a horrible racist fantasy. The story in no way specifies 1200 or 1227 dead. None of Case's sources would have any way of knowing how many dead there were, and it was not a case of simple subtraction as suggested in the comments. The math doesn't work out. I'd be interested to know where the number comes from. Case also presents what he says is the "smoking gun," a memo from a Major General Virgil Peterson commenting on the plan of a General McNair to discipline the 364th. We don't know what McNair's plan was, but Case assumes it must have been the massacre. I would point out that while Peterson's memo doesn't say exactly what McNair's plan is, it doesn't sound from his responses that it's anything extraordinary. For example, Peterson doesn't think the people of Centerville should be given a veto on the black soldiers' access to town. I'm not sure how that fits into a plan to kill a large number of those soldiers. None of this is not to say that bad things weren't going on at Camp Van Dorn. The William Walker killing, in particular, sounds like premeditated murder even in the official documents trying downplay it. Walker, on leave, was confronted by two armed MPs, a town sheriff, and an unspecified number of shotgun-toting men acting as a posse, for the "crime" of missing a button on his uniform. The MPs claimed that even though he was faced with what I assume must have been at least seven heavily armed men Walker started a fight and the sheriff had no choice but to shoot him. I can see why the NAACP would have taken an interest in that. 

The claim that Hitler and the Nazis were obsessed with the occult is embedded in our pop culture now, and often repeated in documentaries as if it is an established fact. (At least in the kinds of documentaries that run on the History Channel.) I am familiar with Otto Rahn, the German medievalist who was inducted into the SS and instructed to do research on the connection between German and French Grail traditions. What I've never seen any proof that Rahn's research was funded because of a belief in the occult, as opposed to the more political aim of proving some sort of territorial claim over France, however tenuous. I'd love some sort of primary reference as to Himmler's exact motives. Is there any truth to the larger Nazi/occult claim? Do we have writings by Hitler or other high ranking Nazi officials on the subject of the occult? Is there good evidence that the Nazis actually expended significant manpower and money to find the Holy Grail or the Spear of Destiny? Obviously, I mean beyond the usual looting of museums that goes on in any conquest. 

The most standard way of looking at how much of the economy any given entity comprises is to compare the value of its production to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the country for the same time period. From this perspective saying that the financial sector accounts for 40% of the economy would seem to be far overblown. This NYU study includes a comparison of the size of the financial sector to GDP right up to the finiancial crisis, and the financial sector maxes out at about 8% of GDP. 

I think you answered your own question. No artist operates in a vacuum. I'm sure Rihanna is perfectly aware of what's being said about her in the rest of pop culture. Is it possible that Rihanna really is a "princess of the Illuminati" (even though the historical Illuminati was anti-royalty) and she and her producers decided to reveal that in a music video? I suppose so. But when it comes to extraordinary claims we as skeptics should require extraordinary evidence, and a playful reference to silly rumors made in a music video is hardly extraordinary evidence. It would be like claiming that Harrison Ford is planning to run for President of the United States because he appeared in Air Force One playing the President -- I don't think we need a denial from Harrison Ford to know that playing the President doesn't automatically mean you consider yourself a candidate. Back on the subject of Rihanna, rumors about her being somehow involved with the Illuminati conspiracy that controls the world probably originated on the website The Vigilant Citizen. As far as I can tell the site's author is anonymous, though he claims some experience in the music industry. 

By American standards George is certainly living in poverty, but standards are different in many parts of Africa. The other element of these stories about Obama's half-siblings is strictly political, suggesting that Mr. Obama was somehow ignoring the plight of his own family. We should remember that Mr. Obama's father divorced his mother when he was three and both his parents remarried shortly afterwards. His mother's family was living in Hawaii and then Indonesia, his father's moved to Atlanta and then Kenya. While these half-siblings may share some of Mr. Obama's DNA, they were never family in any social context. 

With no one disputing the essential facts given, I see no reason to assume they're aren't true. In this particular case there really was a conspiracy at the highest levels of the CIA to cover up uncomfortable truths. 

The science behind the phenomenon is simply that sodium bicarbonate (as baking soda is known to its friends) is amphoteric; that is, it reacts with substances that have either strong acid or base pHs. Most things that we consider bad smelling in a refrigerator are giving off a vapor of strongly acidic particles, therefore sodium bicarbonate powder, with its large surface area, will react with those particles and neutralize them by making them less acidic. And of course Arm & Hammer will be only too happy to tell you all about this. So it the science says it works in theory, but a better question might be, does it work really well? I found at least one chemist who doesn't think so: 

This is another quote from Ted Kennedy, but a few minutes later the then current director of the CIA, Adm. Stansfield Turner, verifies that Kennedy's account of the destruction is correct. 

The movie Zeitgeist greatly overstates the case for mythological similarities between Jesus in the Bible and those predecessors. Conspiracy Science has a detailed takedown of the Horus material. Here's the most important part: 

Okay, scratch the firmware part, but you see the core sentiment expressed quite commonly. I've never fully understood why believers in God see this as such a great argument, as I can see the opposite scenario as being true to. If I were squatting in a foxhole being shot at and I've just put my hand in a pile of goo that used to be my best friend's face, the belief that there's a kind and loving creator would not make a lot of sense to me. So my question is, has there been any research done on whether stressful/life-threatening situations make people more (or less) religious? 

There is certainly no hard evidence that Bill Ayers had anything to do with the writing of Dreams from My Father. There isn't much indirect evidence either, unless you agree with Cashill's frankly puerile literary analysis. (One of his arguments it that only former sailors will write about the wind or use ships as metaphors.) There's no way to prove conclusively Ayers didn't work on the book either, but we must test the credibility of the claim based on the evidence there is, not on what some people might want to be true. A few other elements that should probably be considered. 

If by evidence you mean any cloned babies, the answer so far is no. From an interview with that same Dr. Zavos in January 2011: 

There can be no doubt that the Loch Ness Monster exploded into the public awareness in the 1933, thanks to a few sightings that made national news in Britain. What I'm wondering is if there is any evidence at all that there were sightings before 1933. The first movie about the monster, 1934's The Secret of the Loch, has the locals claim that they've always known the monster is there. (It also has one of the very same locals theorizing the monster hatched recently from a prehistoric egg disturbed by road construction -- consistency is not the movie's strength.) That suggests that very early in the Loch Ness phenomenon this meme of the monster being an ancient legend was established, but I'm curious if there's any truth at all to it. I know about the Saint Columba story, but that account doesn't occur in Loch Ness at all and is from a book full of tall tales. I'm looking for sightings of a creature in the Loch and ones that can be verified as having been recorded before 1933. In other words, people coming forward after 1933 saying "I saw the monster 20 years ago!" don't count, unless they can show that somebody wrote down the details of that account at the time.
