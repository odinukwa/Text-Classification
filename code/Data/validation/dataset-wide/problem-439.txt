A correct theory of quantum gravity might allow for the engineering of better gravitational telescopes (like LIGO today), and might allow us to better understanding of what our telescopes see in the sky, but that is about it. A quantum gravity theory might also help guide us towards a "theory of everything" revealing the deeper structure of the laws of the universe and perhaps calculating some physical constants exactly from first principles rather than simply measuring them, but this would be an additional step beyond quantum gravity and the engineering benefit there would be mostly in the high energy physics involved in short lived particles made up of quarks (called QCD) where physical constants are currently known least accurately. Pretty much all of the fundamental laws of physics with engineering relevance have already been discovered to the full precision at which they have significant engineering implications, outside some very narrow areas like practical nuclear fusion reactors where more precision in existing physical laws would have engineering benefits. 

Why not? Imagine regular armor wrapped with aluminum foil (or for that matter, silver foil) that is held taut? It could be ablative with damages layers torn off between battles like a snake's skin. It wouldn't add much protection from anything except light (and perhaps lasers), of the appropriate waive lengths, and it would be shitty for stealth, but I don't see why it isn't feasible. 

Yes The answer is here. Only takes 25 Billion nukes the size of the Tzar Bomba to do it. The process To completely destroy a planet you need to impart more energy into it than its gravitational binding energy which is calculated using the following equation $E = \frac{3GM^2}{5R}$ Filling in the universal gravitational constant, Mass and Radius of pluto; $6.67\times10^{-11} m^3kg^{-1}s^{-2}$, $1.3\times10^{22}kg$, $1.15\times10^6m$ respectivly. You get $5.9\times10^{27}$ joules of energy. Which is ~25 billion times the energy in the Tzar Bomba with only $2.4\times10^{17}$ joules. 

If your gas giant suffered a concentration of impacts on a much larger scale in one hemisphere you could get the effect you are looking for. The winds of the planet would likely keep the soot kicked up from the impacts segregated into one hemisphere. A bombardment severe enough could leave marks that are visible fro years. 

Yes In modern fission reactors a small amount of the energy released is Gamma radiation. It is captured by the reactor shielding and contributes to the overall heating of the system. If you had a highly active gamma source the same could be done to heat a large piece of shielding. That heat, in turn, could drive a Rankine Cycle (like modern reactors) or Sterling Engine. For efficiencies much better than a panel. For comparison, a Rankine can have efficiency in excess of 40% percent and Sterling engines around 20%, though I seem to recall seeing %50 somewhere. 

Each of the smaller successor states to the U.S.A., each with their greater degree of internal political consensus, would be much easier to govern than the entire United States as it exists today. But, diplomacy that was never necessary before between these factions would now become a major preoccupation. Also, some successor groupings would be more tightly bound than others and with the U.S. Civil War's spell discouraging secession broken, internal politics would always be hunted with exit threats (some more credible than others) in the six federal or confederate successors that would be present. The DSA would probably not have a legislative branch or judicial branch that handled private law cases. It would have a high court of military justice and some administrative law courts and would be run by unequal delegates of the eleven member nations a bit like the European Community before it became the E.U. or NATO or the UN Security Council with its peacekeeping units. Its headquarters would be in Denver because of its central location and because the Rocky Mountain Confederacy would be a weak member of the alliance since strong members would be too envious if the headquarters were located in one of the stronger or more unified members of the DSA. Organizationally, the DSA military would be more like NATO with significant distinct member state sourced military units, than like a truly unified military force. It would probably also be underfunded relative to the current military and riddled with distrust between member forces who would fear both a bid for reunification a some coalition of member states and a member state gaining advantage that it could use against another member state. The DSA would probably not be able to maintain a unified front on trade or immigration policy which have always been the source of strong regional divisions in the U.S.A. The Eleven Member States Of The DSA 

Your people would have adaptations similar to the Sherpa who live at high altitude in Nepal. There are numerous studies of their adaptations, here is a review of the studies and their findings. Some highlights are increased blood flow, more oxygen-carrying capacity in the blood, stronger hearts, and larger chests. A more complete summary is below: 

Here Comes the handwaving Tools: Your protagonist (antagonist?) has access to (builds?) the following: 2 Wakefeild Plasma Accelerators, 2 Storage Rigs, a whole bunch of power, access to LIGO, tons and tons of shielding (literally), and a "lets turn up the power attitude" and/or reckless graduate student. Procedure: The Wakefield accelerators are arranged in a track field shaped configuration, pointing in opposite directions in what would be the straightaways. The storage rings make up the curved ends of the track, with one of them modified to allow for firing at a target on some path tangent to the curve; that just happens (intentionally?) to be pointed at a facility with a cosmic ray detector. It could be hundreds of kilometers away, and let's keep the population density in the intervening distance low. One of the wakefield accelerators is primed and fired into one of the storage rings that catches the accelerated particles and stores them. After some adjustment, the particles are injected into the second wakefield accelerator and then recaptured with significantly higher energy. This process is repeated over and over again. 

A variant of the no liquid fuels idea could be that there are liquid fuels but all known deposits of them have dangerous/toxic impurities that are too costly to remove for mass production use. For example, maybe plants in the Red Queen battle had to have strong venoms to prevent them from being overgrazed and those venoms survived and developed higher concentrations as the plants were broken down over time into oil, so that smoke from burning it without purification spreads a potent nerve gas to anyone in the vicinity. I also take issue with those who say that "steam power" in the colloquial sense as a defining characteristic of Victorian technology, really is about the steam. In my experience one reaches more sensible conclusions if one assumes that the word "steam power" is really code for coal power, as historically, petroleum was not available until decades after the steam age and was used to power mobile steam engines only briefly. 

Payment Systems In countries in the civil law legal tradition (not just Europe but also most of Africa, Asia and Latin America), as opposed to the common law legal tradition of England, the "payment system" aspect of banking is generally handled primarily by the postal service and involves "push" transactions (the European name for them is giros) that are the moral equivalent of a money order as opposed to checks in the common law tradition which "pull" money out of a bank account whose balance is confirmed when the check is presented by the recipient for payment rather than when the instrument is issued the way that a money order would be. We have private money transfer systems in the U.S. that operate more or less the way that a European postal account system does, the most famous being Western Union. Debit cards are also conceptually like European postal account systems because the available balance is confirmed before the payment is made and involves a reduction of a positive balance, rather than an increase of a negative balance the way that a credit card does. For larger transactions, wire transfers via banks are the norm, but wire transfers unlike loans and check transactions, are not functionally extensions of credit to the customer. In both the postal systems and in private money transfer systems, there is usually some sort of fee charged to finance the operation, which is some combination of a monthly account fee, a flat per transaction fee, and a fee that is a function of the amount of the transaction. A related line of business common in developing and third-world countries is that of a money courier, who physically delivers cash in person from a sender to a buyer for a fee, usually as an independent business person. Often money couriers network with each other so that a U.S. courier might deliver funds from an Algerian courier in exchange for the Algerian courier delivering from bound for Algeria by the U.S. courier. The two couriers would trade their obligations with each other rather than the physical cash originally delivered to them. This is basically a primitive form of wire transfer. A slightly more sophisticated version of the same thing is called correspondent banking where someone sets up the moral equivalent of a no interest checking account in several countries and then handles transfers between the accounts. Foreign Exchange The business of exchanging one currency for another that doesn't involve explicit interest is sometimes handled by stand alone businesses but is also commonly handled by commercial banks and could continue to be handled by them. Factoring Another major activity of banks in the early days of banking was a form of secured lending called "factoring". In a factoring transaction, the bank buys accounts receivable from a business in exchange for cash, and the business then uses cash to make purchases. As payments on the factored accounts receivable are received, they are paid over to the bank. The bank pays less than dollar for dollar for the accounts receivable based upon the past history of the business in successfully getting paid by those who owe it money plus an additional profit margin. But, unlike interest, this is a one time transaction that is not dependent upon how long it takes the bank to receive the accounts receivable, and it is generally structured to be non-recourse (i.e. if the bank isn't repaid its cash advance in full that is its tough luck). Investment Banking What you and I ordinarily think of as a "bank" is what is called "commercial banking." There is a kindred finance industry called "investment banking" which lines up long term investments in the stock and bonds of publicly held companies for companies that want to go public or are already publicly held in a process called an "Initial Public Offering" (as distinguished from a secondary sale of a stock or bond from a party other than the issuing company), for a significant fee that is financed with the public offering proceeds. If interest were disallowed or greatly limited, big business would get more of its financing from stock, preferred stock (which is a debt-equity hybrid), and would probably limit debt transactions to "money market" transactions in which big businesses borrow cash at very low interest rates for short periods of time (which even restrictive usury laws might permit) basically for working capital purposes. Trust Management, Safe Deposit Boxes and Cash Management Most banking functions are structured as credit transactions (even deposit accounts are currently merely loans from the customer to the bank). But, not all. Some banks have trust departments that manage money held in trust for others (both conventional private trust funds, usually for family members, and also charitable trusts and accounts such as retirement funds and security deposit funds and monies held in trust by lawyers for their clients), typically on a fee basis that is a function of the amount of assets under management. These can sometimes be invested in real world investments like real estate or leased equipment, as well as stocks and bank deposits. Banks also customarily operate safe deposit boxes and there is no reason that some institution or other wouldn't continue to offer this service. Cash management is what armored car drivers, sometimes affiliated with banks and sometimes as independent businesses do. They drive around, pick up cash received from businesses (and drop off new cash for day to day operations), and get it counted and credited to the account of a business in a manner that is conscious of robbery and embezzlement risks. (This is a booming industry in the era of the all cash legal marijuana industry these days.) Pre-Paid Bonds Just because private lenders wouldn't be allowed to charge interest doesn't mean that governments couldn't issue interest bearing bonds (municipal bonds or treasury bonds in current parlance). Indeed, they might even be legal for private parties since these interest rates are typically very low because default rates are very low. Buying government bonds creates a stream of payments in the future. One could trade in government bonds at discounts and premiums as the case might be in order to pre-pay obligations that would otherwise accrue over a period of installments, while receiving some time value of money benefits. This would be indirect interest, but might be allowed if government bonds were exempted. This is a method used now to close out loans in cases where prepayment is prohibited or prepayment incurs a significant penalty, while avoiding any meaningful risk of default because government bonds almost never default. For example, government bonds might be paired with lease to own transactions to discount future payments and close out the deals. Various kinds of bankers and brokers arrange these deals now and private banks might continue to do so. Credit Unions and Mutual Banks The New Deal featured many cooperatives, especially in rural areas, which are businesses owned by someone with a relationship other than as an investor in the business. For example, a mutual insurance company is one owned by its policyholders. Prior to the FDIC, mutual banks (owned by depositors) and credit unions (non-profit banks) were very popular because they were much less prone to taking risky high levels of leverage to benefit the private investors and frequently went bankrupt in recessions causing the loss of bank deposits. In contrast, mutual banks and credit unions, acting in their owner's interests, were much more conservative and rarely went bankrupt even in recessions (often called "panics" at the time). If the FDIC had not been created, a ban on private investor owned banks, but not mutual banks and credit unions might very well have been allowed, and because any excess profits from these institutions benefit account holders, there would be (and is today) little incentive for them to unnecessarily jack up fees or charge unreasonably high interest rates. Non-Bank Credit, Bonding and Letters of Credit You would also expect to see in an economy without significant interest being allowed, an expansion of "trade credit" between vendors and purchasers (e.g. selling goods that only have to be paid for in 30 days), and a replacement of financing transactions with lease to own transactions (now commonly seen in auto financing mostly because it affords business users of leased vehicles more level deductions for tax purposes). Private banks might get into this trade credit economy by offering "bonding services" for private companies. A bonding agreement in this context means that a financial institution such as a bank would promise to pay any lawful debts of the party to which trade credit was extended up to a dollar cap in exchange for a fee. Basically the bank is co-signing your loans. These arrangements are now pretty much restricted to government officials guaranteeing that their services will be lawfully performed and for firms in the construction trades, but the concept would be more widely used if credit from banks for working capital was not as easily available. A subtype of this transaction is mortgage insurance, but bonding is usually what it is called in cases of domestic trade credit and contractual liability guarantees. Letters of credit issues for a fee are a variation on bonding (where the bank actually pays all debts rather than just defaulted ones in the transaction) that are uncommon now except in international transactions but might become common if interest bearing loans were prohibited. You might also see lots of loan sharking and other black market credit transactions. 

One extinction for another The atmosphere has a mass of $5.5\times10^{18} kg$ processing half of it ($~2.75\times10^{18}kg$) in a week means processing $4.5\times10^{12}kg$ of atmosphere a second. That's four and a half trillion kilograms per second. Now the fastest you can get air to move using a vacuum is the speed of sound, so about $340 m/s$. The majority of the mass of the atmosphere is in the troposphere and one cubic meter of air has a mass of about one kilogram. Therefore we can assume a volumetric flow rate of $4.5\times10^{12}m^3/s$ of the atmosphere. With those parameters, the opening of your vacuum would have to have an area of $1.3\times10^{10} m^2$. We are limiting our work to the troposphere so the height is ~10000 meters making the aperture 1.3 million meters long or 1300 kilometers. Moving air this fast creates pressure drops that will be in their own right fatal over a large area. This pressure drop will also create enormous super storms and lightning and likely kick up megatons of dust. And that's just the info flowing of the air. The outflow is worse, again dust storms, lightning, supersonic winds. But now with all that hot air you will produce the mother of all storms: Supercells and Hypercanes if too close to water. Driven by super heating these storms will push water vapor into the upper atmosphere and destroy the ozone layer. You just kill them faster 

One way for a military leader to end up in that situation would be to be in a society with a long and august tradition of honor and fair play and chivalry who wins with tactics like the Trojan horse and trickery that win battles in dishonorable ways according to the old school of thinking. To capture the sense of it, imagine how many people might despise a Presidential candidate who wins primary after primary by the dozen en route to a nomination for his party, but does so by resorting to demagoguery, low blows, incivility, appeals to people's basest instincts, mockery of honorable men, and outright blatant lies. Even if someone like that won the "war" by being elected President, lots of people might despise him and think poorly of him. There are fairly direct military analogies to that kind of political journey that could lead to the same kind of perception. For example, suppose that the military leader in question won a key battle by raising a white flag of surrender and then attacking the soldiers who had come to accept their surrender with hidden weapons and soldiers who ambushed their leaders. It would be a win, but a dirty one. Perhaps another battle is won by capturing an opposing leader's family and publicly torturing them until the opposing leader gives in, and then slaughtering the tortured family members once he had the opposing leader's surrender in hand. Maybe another battle is won by poisoning the lake that is the sole water supply for the region, killing huge numbers of civilians and rendering the entire area uninhabitable for another decade or more. Maybe his troops are relatively unskilled and undisciplined, prone to raping and pillaging without authorization to do so, prone to infighting among themselves often resorting in pointless, deadly duels between members of his own force, and he himself is fat, lazy, rude, capricious with his treatment of his underlings, not very competent in one on one combat, and prone to make serious gaffs that show a lack of knowledge of the places that he is conquering. It is easy to see how such a man could have several big military successes and yet still be viewed as mediocre. 

Earth With Rings The Rings First things first. Rings around a planet are comparatively short-lived. For example, there is speculation that the rings of Saturn may be very young and only have a 100 million or so years left in existence. They will fall into the plant thanks to gravitation interactions between other bodies in the solar system and radiation pressure from the sun. The important takeaway is that rigs from through some other cataclysm after a plant has formed. So your planet will form much like the earth, accrete mass, clear out its orbit, get hit by another body and form the moon. Hey look the earth has rings! 

Isomer Bomb Triggered With the right Isomer, it may be possible to induce a very violent and rapid decay by blasting it with gamma rays. This may be a viable method for trigger an explosion using Hafnium which has been looked into. Your weapons could consist of a primer that triggers a blast of gamma rays into (insert isomer here) resulting in the rapid decay. Put in a casing that can help focus the decay products to continue the reaction. This may or may not be how some nuclear weapons work. With advances in particle physics, it may be possible to engineer elements/isomers that fit the needs required. On a similar note, a universe I'm working on has an extremely advanced civilization using a stable-ish Hassium isomer in kinetic weapons because of its very high density, predicted to be ~40 g/cm$^3$. Stored? Since an isomer is a metastable nucleus, that is to say, kept from decaying because its constitute parts have just enough extra energy to hold together and that decay occurs when that energy is released. Therefore, it might be possible to store the isomer in an environment that constantly keep the nucleus on the perturbed. I imagine a scenario where the isomer is stored under gamma ray illumination, the energy of the decaying isomer is replaced the flux of extra gamma radiation. This would only be practical if the decay chain has several steps in it, otherwise, the gamma radiation would be better suited as the weapon itself. 

Incidentally, I don't think you'd need seven hot spots, because they tend to migrate. The four southern hotspots could easily be a single migrating hotspot and produce essentially the same topography, and indeed all six could be from a single hot spot if the Japan plate in the hypothetical case was moving rapidly in geological terms early on and was twisted a bit from pressures from the adjacent plates. A formation like that would be more in line with real world precedents. In terms of weather, this ought to expose western Japan to more intense typhoons. Subduction zones on both sides of the island would also greatly increase volcano and earthquake activity in western Japan. A subduction zone to the west of Japan would also greatly change its ecology, because a western Japan trench formed by the subduction zone would have prevented any land bridges or very shallow sea access to the islands as happened historically which was a major source of its pre-Iron Age population (the Jomon) and was also a source of much of its terrestrial life. With subduction zones on each side Japan would have terrestrial fauna and flora that would be much more distinct from the mainland in real world Japan, more like pre-Maori New Zealand. This topography would also probably greatly increase the number of distinct watersheds in the region, eliminating the long rivers necessary for larger freshwater fish. 

Climate Depends on several things, if we are sticking with the Earth-Sun system then the Earth will get much hotter since it will receive more the solar energy than it gets now. Probably pretty bad for the majority of life on earth but Antarctica could be a nice place to live at least. Now, this is assuming nothing is done to alter the Earth. If we are talking moving planets then altering the atmosphere is easy. Removing the greenhouse gasses is one step that could preserve the earth because without them the earth would be very cold. With a faster rotation expect winds to be very different, again hard to say directly but expect them to be moving faster. The Coriolis Effect will play a much larger part in the weather than it does here on earth. A combination of more winds and higher temp extremes probably will cause superstorms. Probably still habitable, just much hotter. For example the solar system inner limit may be as low as .5 AU. 

Sarcasm, idioms, slang, and hyperbole Your translator seems very literal, which means that quirks of language will be missed. For example: In English when someone makes a mistake you yell fail In Italian (and when and where I visited) for the same act, they yelled Flauto which directly translates to flute. Which has little to do with failure. There are plenty of other examples but the best is everyone's favorite four letter word that starts with an f and ends like firetruck. Imagine it's literal meaning added to each of these examples. Languages rely heavily on context and the speakers themselves, and while I suppose not outside the bounds of a magical object, require a powerful translator to avoid loosing any information. 

A plastic brick building in Columbia from here. This example is small scale, but there is no good reason that bigger blocks perhaps as big as those in the pyramids or medieval castles, but much lighter to place, couldn't be used. For example, a version of this technology developed in New Zealand can be designed to use much larger, less finely polished bricks. Imagine cubic yard sized bales of plastic turned into smooth bricks. The world is full of plastic crap that would be readily available in a post-apocalyptic world (it could be mined from landfills or gathered from floating plastic in the sea, if necessary), can often be compressed, melted and reformed into convenient shapes. This technique is used to make plastic bricks in some developed countries. Landfills are more ubiquitous than quality quarries or old growth forests which would be good in a time period when long distance transportation of low value building materials might be a problem. Also, once placed, the plastic bricks can be welded into a single solid surface with heat. And, plastic is forever. Most kinds don't biodegrade over time. Animals don't eat it. It isn't friendly to plants that could root in it. If it's thick enough it can handle rough weather. It isn't as brittle as glass or ceramic or brick which would be good in places with earthquakes (perhaps fracking induced as people chase scare hydrocarbon supplies) or major storms. Also, plastic is water proof which would be attractive in coastal areas put at risk of periodic storm surges in a world where sea levels had risen due to global warming. While the bricks in the image above are bland and gray, plastic can come in many colors and random mix of pre-apocalypse marketing driven colors could provide an ugly/beautiful aesthetic that characters could muse upon adding "local color" to the story. The (optional) aluminum or tin cover foil would prevent it from melting in the sun or from minimal stray fire exposure, but with sufficient ignition and intentionally poked holes in the metal cover it could burn. Plastic Concrete A wall made of "plastic concrete":
