TL,DR; Yes, it makes great tactical sense to do this. Details In addition to the "There's no Stealth in Space" articles, another article is pertinent to the discussion. Its conclusion is that space fighters are generally a Bad Idea (TM). But that is not why you should read the section. It states that it makes more sense to replace the space fighter with an expendable missile bus. Basing the weapons on current and extrapolated propulsion systems, the missile bus would possess a high Isp, low thrust engine capable of supplying a large delta V and low acceleration. The missiles would possess lower Isp, higher thrust engines to ensure the target couldn't "jink" out of the way or shoot it down. When the targeting computer on the missile bus calculated the missile's delta V would permit an intercept, it would drop missiles for the intercept. It's conceivable that the missile bus would hold many missiles and make several such drops for each target. Each missile's targeting computer would calculate its optimal & terminal burns (a maneuvering missile is harder to shoot down) to ensure intercept. The missiles would fly ballistically (no propulsion) until it reached one of those burn windows. The benefit this tactic provides is manifold. The target will see the missile bus (or fighter) as it uses its propulsion. The missile bus can eject missile pairs in opposite directions and impart a large separation force. These means each missile will arrive on different trajectories (making defense harder). Because the missile hasn't used its propulsion yet, it's possible the defender won't see the missile ejections. The missile bus and missile on-board computers will have shared planned trajectories so that all dropped missiles arrive at similar times. The target will see the missile bus and know it has been engaged. Depending upon the details of the engagement, it might not see the actual missiles until after the first time it sees each missile make its optimal trajectory change burn, the target will know for sure that it was fired upon. Also due to the nature of ballistic flight, it will be trivially easy for the target to compute the missile's location. A smart defender would use this knowledge to try to maneuver out of the threat envelop of the missile, shoot it down, engage ECM, or all the above. Reference Atomic Rockets: Space Fighter. 

But they have to draw the line somewhere. Where is that line? I am also viewing this question as a societal one - not necessarily as a dictatorial ruling form on high. The punishment for the crime of not working was set by the citizens of this society. I suppose I could see it working like this: 

1. National Aerospace Plane In the late 1980s I worked on the National Aerospace Plane. At the start, of the project, I felt that we could not such a thing. By the end, I had come to the conclusion that we could build it, if we sunk enough resources into it. Estimated time to complete 5-10 years. 2. Cheap Space Launch Infrastructure R&D and construction for Light Craft / laser launcher, Ram Accelerator, Light Gas Gun, or Coil Gun to launch objects into space cheaply. Estimated time to R&D 5-15 years. Estimated time to construct 5-10 years. 3. Fusion Power Plants We still don't understand everything that we need to build viable fusion power plants but after 60 years of trying we are finally at least in the ballpark. At current project funding, such a plant won't reach scientific break-even for a decade or so. Within 5-10 years after that we might achieve engineering break-even. Economic break-even will follow sometime after that. Unlimited resourced would speed this up significantly, perhaps halving the time it takes to finish. Estimated time to complete 10-20 years. 4. Interplanetary Craft Using current state of the art nuclear power and propellants, we could build space craft that would scoot to Saturn within months rather than 6 or more years. Estimated time to complete: 10-20 years 5. Space Colony Using the craft mentioned above, there are no theoretical reasons that we could not build, populate, and maintain colonies on many bodies of the solar system. Estimated time to complete 20-30 years. 6. Space Elevator Until about 15 years ago, space elevators weren't even deemed scientifically feasible. Oh sure, the required materials strength was within the theoretical maximum chemical bond strength of materials we knew (e.g. single crystal iron could do it), however, we didn't know of any bulk materials with the sort of tensile strength required for the project. Then we discovered how to make nanotubes. Single nanotubes have the desired strength and light weight properties for a project like this. However, we still don't know how to make single tubes with a length of 48,000+ km long. But imagine that we develop a method to grow the nanotubes in-situ microgravity. The main problem facing a project after resolving that issue would be the politics :( Estimated time to complete R&D 20+ years Estimated time to complete construction 10-20 years 7. Interstellar Craft Some of the most advance propulsion schemes current known (e.g. Nuclear Pulse Propulsion [aka the old BOOM - BOOM], Fission Fragment Rocket, & Fusion Fragment Propulsion) to be possible would make manned interstellar flights possible. However, it would take most of the industrial output of the entire Earth for many decades to put it together. Estimated time to complete 50-100 years to build Estimated trip time 150+ years 8. Terraform Mars Why stop with basic outposts when physics tells us what we need to do to make Mars a "shirt sleeve" environment. Use our interplanetary craft and begin playing Solar System billiards. Shove smallish ice blocks from Saturn's rings so that they impact at Mars' poles. We bombard the poles for two reasons, 

There's two factors that you need to worry about: chemical weathering and mechanical wearing. Chemical Weathering For chemical weathering purposes, perhaps the best rock to last through the centuries would be slate. Remnants of rock after chemical weathering -> silt Silt compressed into rock -> Shale Shale metamorphosed -> Slate Since slate is compose of only mineral grains that survived chemical weathering, it is of necessity highly resistant to chemical weathering. Unfortunately, it really isn't resistant to mechanical weathering. So if not subjected to mechanical weathering, your best bet is slate. It would likely last several centuries for rain to erode the house. Mechanical Weathering To resist mechanical weathering you want a rock that is very hard and tough. Granite (and related rocks like andesite & rhyolite) are composed of multiple different minerals. In combination they act like a composite material with the different materials providing some of their better qualities to the overall structure. Unfortunately, several of the minerals in granite are highly susceptible to chemical attacks. Stroll through a cemetery and look at the granite headstones. After a few decades the chemical weathering begins to make reading those headstones quite difficult. But if you took a hunk of slate and bashed it into a hunk of granite, the granite is going to win - every time. For water to erode the structure will likely take 1-2 centuries. The Winner Since you stated this is a post-human world, I'll make the assumption that weathering is the primary factor for your building - which means Slate is the ultimate winner. 

People are people. Take any (sufficiently large) subgroup of people and ask me what they'll do under a set of circumstances and by far the most likely answer is "the same thing any other group of people would do." So, you ask: Would wars still happen after a Rapture-like event? If so, why? Yes Because people are people. Perhaps a more interesting question comes from understanding what The Rapture means to certain evangelical Christians. Some sects have embellished "The Rapture" and included lots of lore not found in any historic Christian writings. Usually these embellishments (now) include a global apocalyptic war, probably nuclear. My opinion is that this is not more or less likely than such a war would be prior to such an event. You add this statement: 

At around 400 BC, the Greeks created the above contraption and demonstrated that the expulsion of fluids (in this case gases) could be used as a form of propulsion. Marine By comparison the development of water jets as a means of pushing ships around is a relatively new development. 

In spaceships, every gram counts! Putting this another way, no ship - not even a space ship dedicated to combat - could afford to carry mass whose only purpose was as armor against other weapons. However, a clever spacecraft designer could indeed layer a ship in such a way to protect the most valuable parts of the ship (like the crew) with less valuable parts of the ship. Some items on any atomic power space craft that it would have to carry and could provide protection against weapons fire are: 

One example of how this might happen is you have a predator with peak activity during a specific time of day (e.g. a sight oriented predator that doesn't tolerate high temperatures might be most active in the morning). Populations of the prey species which are most active outside of the predator's peak activity (e.g. afternoon and dawn) would avoid the predator, have a better chance of survival, and be more likely to pass on their genes. Since predators adapt to the behavior of prey and vice versa, eventually this will drive one population of the prey species to be active earlier and earlier with the other to be active later and later. Eventually the two populations of the prey species will not share the same active period and not interact appreciably. Over time this will cause speciation. Traits of the two groups There is no certainty about what traits the two groups will develop. Obviously they'll develop traits that help them survive in the environment their population uses. For example, we don't know whether the nocturnal group will develop low light sensitive, echo location, or improved sense of smell. However, the trait will be consistent with neutral or positive chances of survival. Traits with negative survival potential are quickly weeded out. To get the specific traits that you want really has little to do with the nocturnal/diurnal speciation and more to do with the specific evolutionary pressures those environments impose on those populations. Some possibilities for your specific traits: 

Some type of 3d printer Current 3d printer technologies typically restrict the material types each type of printer can use (e.g. some can do plastics, others can do metals, most can't do materials dissimilar to what they were designed to use). If the benefactor had access to one of the more advanced machines as well as feed stock, this would be a wonderful thing to put into the treasure chest. This is included in The Global Village Construction Set.

As the environment changes from that found on the surface of the Earth to higher pressures and colder temperatures, water ice can take many different other forms. Interior of Titan 

TL,DR; Yes, you could do something like this. No, the system you proposed definitely could not do this without killing the human(s) inside. The acceleration I derive from your numbers (if you assume constant acceleration - which is a bad assumption for conventional guns), is an acceleration of ~7000 g's for about 0.1 seconds. 7000 g's is guaranteed to turn your crew into red jelly at the back of the capsule. Details Background Years ago I wrote up description of how the Ram Accelerator technology could be used to accomplish this goal. Researchers have used experimental Ram Accelerators for decades. We could probably build one now that could launch things into orbit. 

Identify all (or most) of the genes influencing intelligence. Identify the side-effects (especially the negative ones) associated with the "smart" setting. Figure out if we can counteract negative effects with other settings.

If you take predation "off the menu" for your planet's ecosystem, then you may need to rely upon social factors determining an animal's ability to mate. This could drive the population to higher intelligence, it might just take longer than it did on Earth. Alternatively, if you wished to drive many animal species to higher intelligence, make a planet with lots of sophisticated dangers. Only the animals with high intelligence or high birth rates create children able to survive the environment. 

The problem is that anyone even casually knowledgeable of physics or chemistry knows that these "elements" don't exist - nor are there any "missing" elements in the periodic table. I have worked with advanced materials and know that there's really a few ways we can get materials with exotic properties: 

Yes If those copies can perform useful services (entertainment, research, answering phones, etc.) then a market to buy and sell them will arise. My own belief is that eventually the law, society, and morality of biological humans will catch up with this development and ban the "enslavement" of AI entities like you proposed; human society can sometimes take way too long to take appropriate actions. I find it perfectly believable that the state you describe could exist for decades (centuries?) before the rest of human civilization realized what it was doing. With a bit of a stretch, I could imagine it as a redux of the American Civil War with the abolition of slavery of electronic entities (EE) as its rallying cry. 

Here's some discussion on a science board about what chemists have found react hypergolically or explosively. Here's a list of videos which show the same. General discussion The problem with a plant carrying a digestive chemical which reacts so strongly with the chemistry of other living things is this: creatures evolved on the same planet, share the same chemistry. Meaning that plant contains chemicals which can cause itself to spontaneously burst into the flame if its reservoir of that chemical is ruptured. Imagine an explore hacking his way through a jungle with a machette. He accidentally hits this "flame bush" and ruptures its digestive sack - immediately causing the plant to burst into flame. If any of that fluid sprayed out of the sack, say onto another plant or the explorer, then adjacent plants and even the explorer also burst into flame. Fun stuff There are chemicals which are hypergolic with many other chemicals. You might find the discussion in Sand won't save you this time discussion amusing or interesting. The chemical is called chlorine trifluoride ($ ClF_3 $ ).
