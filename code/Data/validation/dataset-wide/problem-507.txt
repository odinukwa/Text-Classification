I spent the last few days spraying lubricant on the pedals and clipping in and out of the pedals on a stationary bike whilst leaning against a wall. The pedals did gradually become loose but were still too stiff for my liking. Nonetheless I ventured out to my local park wearing one normal trainer and one cycling shoe on the other foot. This allowed me to practice clipping in and out using one foot whilst the other foot wasn't clipped in which was very reassuring. I did one lap of the park without any problems and then wore cycling shoes on both feet. I found that clipping out seemed easier on a slow moving bike than when I was clipping out on a stationary bike. I also found that when my foot was at the bottom of the pedal stroke, it made it immensely easier to clip out. 

Can anyone advise on what parts will need replacing? Also, how can I prevent this from happening again? Thanks 

I have a Specialized Allez Elite road bike, purchased brand new in June this year. So far I've covered around 300 miles in total on it. During my ride yesterday, as I was going up a slight hill, I switched to the smaller front chain ring. As I did this, I heard a sickening crunch, pedals jammed, looked down to find one of the gear changing parts is jammed into the back chain rings and chain has come off. Luckily I managed to get onto the footpath and dismount without any problems. I don't know much about bikes so have provided an image of the damage: 

It's called a stem clamp binder nut. The names don't get more specific than that, unfortunately. You could search for the bolt by the stem name, and maybe get lucky finding another one. It's not a super-common setup for stems; they typically used a hex nut. If it doesn't fit a little further into the stem, it's most likely an incorrect size for the stem. The flange should sit flush when the bolt is fully tightened. The binder bolt thread only comes in a few sizes, so you may just have a bolt that "works" but is not original to the stem. 

To align the caliper, loosen the caliper bolts and bring the fixed cpad as close as possible to the rotor without rubbing. Then dial in the fixed pad so that it is as close as possible without rubbing. Then install your cable/housing, and begin adjusting. To improve brake feel, pre-stretch your cable before making adjustments. Take the wheel out, out a pad spacer in (Pedro's tire lever works great, or any other non-metal object), and squeeze the lever as hard as you can ten times. This will seat the housing into the ferrules, as well as stretch the cable out. If the pads are sitting in a "V", then the brake pad spring most likely needs replacing. You could also try spreading it open a bit first, but the springs are so cheap that it's worth it just to get new ones. P.S. The Alfine dynamo actually uses loose ball bearings, making it re-packable. It's tricky, due to the wiring connectors, but it's nice to be able to do it yourself. Avid Brake Pad Spring 

You have tires you can run with really low pressure (for more traction in the snow). You can have your mountainbike frame and disc brakes. In my opinion you even don't need a suspension with such a bike, the low pressure in your tires is really enough comfort and suspension. If you ride more rural and snowy roads it can be really fun with such a bike! And actually most of the "big players" in the mountainbike sector have their own model. 

As fixie-biking is really trendy at the moment, i often see fixie riders 'skidding' and stopping their bike by blocking their backwheel. As this only works by shifting the riders weight to the front of the wheel i recently wondered if there is a physical limit (like weight) where this braking method will not work anymore because the pressure on the back wheel is still to big to skid? 

I think about buying a new mountainbike when sale is starting. Now my Problem is that my favorite mountainbike has only 2 chainrings with 36/26 teeth. I am used to ride with 3 chainrings and don't know if it's too hard for me to ride or if it feels like "some gears are missing" if there is one chainring less. I am just a hobby cyclist, I love to do some tours an evening rides, but just for fun. Maybe someone can explain advantages and disadvantages of 2 vs 3 chainrings. 

Is there anything else a newbie like me should consider before buying a single gear bike? I'm 6'2" and weigh 10 stone. Appreciate the help. 

I'm new to clip less riding. I just purchased and installed Shimano R540 SPD SL Road Pedals for my bike. I also got Shimano R064 SPD SL Road Shoes. I have been practising clipping in and out indoors in the hallway using the walls either side to balance myself whilst on the bike. I can clip in without too much difficulty, but find it extremely tough to clip out (even with the tension set to the lowest setting). I found that I am twisting and then almost yanking the shoes out of the pedals. I'm pretty sure this isn't how it is meant to be. If I attempted this on the road, I would fall flat on my face. I have sprayed some lubricant on the pedals in the hope that they loosen overnight. But other than that I've been stumped as to what else I could do. Appreciate any tips, helpful suggestions and advice on the matter. Thanks 

There are two possibilities: 1.) The roller brake mechanism and internals are completely seized. Based on the level of rust on the outside of the brake, there is a strong possibility that there is rust inside as well. Shimano roller brakes do need to be in fairly good condition, and have the correct Shimano grease in them to work well. If the brake had a very thick type of grease injected into it, it may have gummed up the brake completely. The Shimano Nexave roller brakes, are technically serviceable, but are not warrantied by Shimano if opened up. They are designed as a complete unit; replacement internals are not available, and must be scavenged from other brakes. Most shops will typically not service the internals; know that if a shop is willing to, there are no new parts going into the brake. Nexave brakes are fairly inexpensive, and any good shop should be able to supply you with a replacement, and install it as well. Despite my normal recommendations to overhaul existing equipment, this is one instance where replacement is the best route. 2.) You are possibly missing a spacer/locknut between the brake drum and the frame. While this is not your exact brake, the parts are similar. You may be missing item #2. It looks as though the end of the fork blade may be contacting the drum, and exerting pressure on the drum, preventing it from springing back. Be sure that there is the appropriate locknut holding the brake unit in place, and the over-locknut dimension is 100mm. This is only likely if the hub has been overhauled, and the brake was put on incorrectly, with the locknut missing. The reason the brake works while rolling backwards is that the drum is being pushed in the "open" direction, loosening the internals (from whatever is making them stick), and allowing the brake to operate normally. 

Personally the problem is not the distance, but the time i need to commute, especially in the mornings. So, is a roadbike that much faster than a cyclocross bike so that it's worthwhile to take a longer distance to commute and be even faster? 

On a magazine i saw a bike with a magnificent frame. I would love to know what model it is. Maybe someone can help me. 

This sounds like a perfect job for a Fatbike! Those bikes were made for such conditions you describe. 

Yesterday, a little boy hit my carbon framed road bike with his little bike while I was already standing. He was not very fast, the normal 'little-boy-dreaming-on-his-bike'-speed. So, nobody got hurt, but his mum wanted me to check the frame, she was very sorry and apologized hundreds of times. After a first look, I can not see any visible cracks or something. Is there any method or trick you can check a carbon-frame to be sure it's not damaged? Can there even be some cracks you do not see? (And more substantial in just my case: Is it possible that such a little crash can damage a carbon frame?).
