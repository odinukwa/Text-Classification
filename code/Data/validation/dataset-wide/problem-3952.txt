Google Books snippet view shows you different little snippets of the speech. The beginning of the speechs has "by study and information we became convinced that Serre and Kodaira had not only made highly original and important..." If you do a search for the phrase "convinced that Serre" (with quotes) in Google Books, you'll find several books that have the speech: "International Mathematical Congresses: An Illustrated History", the ICM Proceedings, a French "Compte Rendu" of the Proceedings, and the "Gesammelte Abhandlungen" of Hermann Weyl. The search comes up empty elsewhere, which strongly suggests that you need to get one of these books from the library for the whole speech. The Intelligencer has the last paragraph, which has been reprinted many times and is surely fair use: 

I have heard algebraic number theory called "algebraic geometry in one dimension". (Or maybe you could call it arithmetic geometry in one dimension.) There is a natural emphasis in algebraic number theory on elliptic curves, function fields, etc. The reason is that algebraic geometry in one dimension is relatively well controlled, so that you can instead focus on arithmetic issues. I might describe the philosophy this way, even though it is not my area and not my philosophy: If number theory is like playing music, and algebraic geometry is like juggling, then general arithmetic geometry is like playing music while juggling the instruments. I.e., it's a great thing to do, but it combines two problems that already hard enough separately. To the extent that you adopt this emphasis, it makes sense that you would learn more from complex curves than from higher-dimensional complex geometry. But without the one-dimensional emphasis, it is not true. For instance, the Weil conjectures are a deep result in higher-dimensional number theory, if you can call finite fields number theory, and they are both motivated by and informed by higher-dimensional complex geometry. (If number theory is music, finite fields could be music mainly in one note. If I had to juggle instruments, I might rather juggle tambourines or triangles.) I should add that restricting to one dimension isn't a completely consistent vision of geometry. To give two examples, if $C$ is a complex curve of genus $g > 1$, it comes from a higher-dimensional moduli space, and it has a higher-dimensional Jacobian variety. These issues also arise in positive characteristic. The philosophy that algebraic number theory is one-dimensional is there, but it is not a completely serious philosophy, and not just because higher-dimensional generalizations exist. The Langlands program eventually leads you to the opposite philosophy. Finally there are also connections between number theory and manifolds with three real dimensions, because of the fact that the boundary of hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^3$ is a Riemann sphere and $\text{Isom}(\mathbb{H}^3) = \text{PSL}(2,\mathbb{C})$. 

Here is a question in the intersection of mathematics and sociology. There is a standard way to encode a Sudoku puzzle as an integer programming problem. The problem has a 0-1-valued variable $a_{i,j,k}$ for each triple $1 \le i,j,k \le 9$, expressing that the entry in position $(i,j)$ has value $k$. The Sudoku rules say that four types of 9-sets of the variables sum to 1, to express that each cell is filled with exactly one number, and that each number appears exactly once in each row, column, and $3 \times 3$ box. And in a Sudoku puzzle, some of these variables (traditionally 27 of them) are preset to 1. It is known that generalized Sudoku, like general integer programming, is NP-hard. However, is that the right model for Sudoku in practice? I noticed that many human Sudokus can all be solved by certain standard tricks, many of which imply a unique rational solution to the integer programming problem. You can find rational solutions with linear programming, and if the rational solution is unique, that type of integer programming problem is not NP-hard, it's in P. Traditionally Sudoku puzzles have a unique solution. All that is meant is a unique integer solution, but maybe the Sudoku community has not explored reasons for uniqueness that would not also imply a unique rational solution. Are there published human Sudoku puzzles with a unique solution, but more than one rational solution? Is there a practical way to find out? I guess one experiment would be to make such a Sudoku (although I don't know how difficult that is), and then see what happens when you give it to people. 

I was vague on the positions of the planes. The orthogonal projection of $V$ onto $W$ has a singular value decomposition, and the singular values are $\cos \theta_1,\ldots,\cos \theta_n$. The orthogonal projection the other way is the transpose, or Hermitian transpose in the complex case, so it has the same singular values. The corresponding singular vectors are the lines $V \cap P_k$ and $W \cap P_k$. So the actual explicit work of finding the geodesic comes from solving a singular value problem, or equivalently an eigenvalue problem. 

First of all, it doesn't matter whether or not the map is smooth. If you find any continuous map, then it will have a smooth approximation. The other answers so far explain that the cobordism group gives you an obstruction to improving a singular-simplicial chain into a mapped-in manifold. In fact, it is easy to see that this is basically the only obstruction, and that null corbodism directly gives you a way to improve the simplicial chain. I'll work with integer coefficients rather than over $\mathbb{Z}/2$ so that things survive a little longer. Say that you have this $(k+1)$-dimensional cobounding chain. You can manifold-ize a $k$-dimensional face of the chain because various $k$-dimensional sheets meet the face with opposite sign and you can pair them. This is basically using the fact that the reduced 0-corbodism group is trivial. Then turn to the $(k-1)$-faces. Because of what you did to the $k$-faces, the sheets meet the $(k-1)$-faces in a collection of circles. But circles are null cobordant, so you can smooth them. You can continue in this way using the fact that oriented surfaces and 3-manifold are all null-cobordant. But when you try to improve a $(k-3)$-face, the link of the an incoming sheet can be a 4-manifold that is not null-cobordant, like $\mathbb{C}P^2$. Then you're stuck. The obstruction is fundamental because the original null-homologous $k$-cycle could have been an embedded $\mathbb{C}P^2$, and the original cobounding chain could have been a cone over it. 

A motivation for the term "over" is that if $k$ is a relatively initial ring, for instance a field, then the algebra and geometry of a scheme "over" $k$ have coefficients in $k$. Long before schemes were defined, you could talk about a curve defined "over" the complex numbers or a ring defined "over" the integers. The realization was that you might as well generalize this concept as much as possible and let $k$ be any scheme. As you say, it also captures the notion of fibrations or families, and part of the point is that in the end that's not really different. For instance if you have a scheme over the integers $\mathbb{Z}$, is that choosing coefficients or is that a fibration? It's both, because you can specialize to $\mathbb{Z}/p$ for any prime $p$ and that specialization is a fiber. 

(The total does not add up because a polynomial can be divisible by more than one cyclotomic polynomial.) 

Here also is a remark about Noah Snyder's answer to the other question. He points out that the representation ring of $G$ is graded by the character group $Z(G)^*$ of the center of $G$. It sometimes so happens, when the characters of $G$ are all real, that the Schur-Frobenius indicator is given by a group homomorphism from $Z(G)^*$ to $\{\pm 1\}$. If so, then of course the indicator gives you a reduced grading of the representation ring of $G$. So, it would be interesting to know which finite or compact groups have this property, or an analogous property for another Brauer group. I think (not quite sure) that all compact simple Lie groups with real characters are examples. 

One more remark: The geometric picture of a foliation with a transverse volume structure holds for closed $k$-forms that are also non-zero simple forms (i.e., wedge products of linearly independent 1-forms). I think it's a theorem that any closed $k$-form is locally a sum of closed, simple $k$-forms. If that's correct, then that's also a way to visualize a closed $k$-form, as an algebraic superposition of volumed foliations. $k=1$ and $k=n-1$ are special cases in which every non-zero form is simple. 

I'd like to summarize the answer that has developed from Eric Shechter's book, via Mark Meckes, plus the remark from Gerald Edgar. Since it's not really my answer, I'm making this a community answer. 

There is only one embedding of $M$ into $\mathbb{R}^{k+n}$ for $k \gg n$. A stable framing of $M$ induces a normal framing of $M$, because the total bundle of $M$ in this embedding is trivial. Make a tubular neighborhood $N$ around $M$ which is diffeomorphic to the normal bundle of $M$. Make a map from $\mathbb{R}^{k+n}$ to $S^k = \mathbb{R}^k \cup \{\infty\}$ which sends the complement of $N$ to $\infty$, and sends each normal fiber to $\mathbb{R}^k$ using the framing of that fiber. The map extends to $S^{k+n}$ by sending $\infty$ to $\infty$. 

The question has basically been answered in the comments by David Speyer and SJR. It is a theorem of Chebyshev that that for any irrational $\alpha$ and any real $\beta$, the inequality $$|\alpha n - k - \beta| < 3/n$$ has infinitely many solutions. In particular, take $\alpha = 1/(2\pi)$ and $\beta = \frac12$. Then one gets that $n$ is so close to an odd multiple of $\pi$ that $|\sin n|^n$ converges to 1 for these values. Even if you took $|\sin n|^{n^2}$, these values would be bounded away from 0. Certainly if the terms of a series do not converge to 0, then the series does not converge. 

In the structure theory of an operator acting on an infinite-dimensional vector space over a field $F$, there is some good news and a lot of bad news. The best news (as Matthew Emerton mentions) is the classification of finitely generated modules over a PID. This beautiful theorem immediately generalizes the Jordan canonical form theorem and the classification of finite or finitely generated abelian groups. It says that every f.g. module over a PID $R$ is a direct sum of cyclic modules $R/d$, and the summands are unique in either the primary decomposition (which comes from the proof by isotypic submodules and Jordan blocks) or the invariant factor decomposition (which comes from the Smith normal form proof). You can take $R = \mathbb{Z}$, or $R = F[x]$ for a field $F$, or of course there are other choices. I suspect that the bad news is likely to be uniformly bad for countably generated modules over any PID. I found a reference for the case of torsion-free abelian groups, so I will concentrate on that case first. Consider the abelian groups $A$ that lie between $\mathbb{Z}^2$ and $\mathbb{Z}[\frac1p]^2$ for a prime $p$. Those choices for $A$ that are free abelian are just lattices in the plane (whose coordinates have denominators that are powers of $p$). There is an important theorem from the theory of affine buildings that you can make an infinite tree of valence $p+1$ out of these lattices. Two lattices are equivalent if they are the same lattice up to homothetic expansion (by a power of $p$). Two lattices are connected by an edge if they are nested and their quotient is $\mathbb{Z}/p$. So, the theorem says that this graph whose vertices are lattices is acyclic and has degree $p+1$ everywhere; the graph is an affine Bruhat-Tits building of type $A_1$. Given a general $\mathbb{Z}^2 \subseteq A \subseteq \mathbb{Z}[\frac1p]^2$, you can let $A_n = (\frac1{p^n}\mathbb{Z}^2) \cap A$. This is the type of direct limit that Matthew Emerton describes, which looks good, but bad news is coming. For a while, $A_n/A_{n-1}$ can be $(\mathbb{Z}/p)^2$, then it can be $\mathbb{Z}/p$, and then $A_n$ might stop growing. If it stops growing, then $A$ is free with two generators. If it always grows by $(\mathbb{Z}/p)^2$, then $A = \mathbb{Z}[\frac1p]^2$. But in the middle case, if it grows by $\mathbb{Z}/p$, then $A$ is described by a path in the affine building from the origin to infinity. There are uncountably many ($2^{\aleph_0}$) such paths, and they have a $p$-adic topology. So when are two such modules $\mathbb{Z}^2 \subseteq A \subseteq \mathbb{Z}[\frac1p]^2$ and $\mathbb{Z}^2 \subseteq B \subseteq \mathbb{Z}[\frac1p]^2$ isomorphic? The outer module is obtained by tensoring either $A$ or $B$ with $\mathbb{Z}[\frac1p]$, so the question is when $A$ and $B$ are equivalent under the action of $\text{GL}(2,\mathbb{Z}[\frac1p])$, which is a countable group. After localizing at all of the other primes, this question was studied by Hjorth, Thomas, and other logicians and algebraists. As Brian Conrad suggests, they have several theorems that indicate that the answer is wild, similar in spirit to the classification of infinite graphs up to isomorphism. Now suppose that $F$ is a field, most conveniently a countable or finite field, and suppose that $V$ is an $F[x]$-module lying between $F[x]^2$ and $F[x,x^{-1}]^2$. Then you get the same geometric picture as before: The $F[x]$-free choices for $V$, up to homothety by powers of $x$, form an affine building which is an infinite tree, such that the neighbors of each vertex are a projective line $FP^1$. The complicated submodules are the ones that correspond to paths in this tree from the origin to infinity. If $F$ is finite or countable, then $\text{GL}(2,F[x,x^{-1}])$ is also countable, but the set of these paths is always uncountable and the group action is always far from transitive. I don't know if Hjorth's and Thomas' results extend to this case (because I am not qualified to read their papers), but my guess is that they would be comparably pessimistic. There are other cases in which you get good news, basically by making infinite-dimensional operators look like finite-dimensional operators. The module $V$ in the previous paragraph has no $x$-eigenvectors even after passing to the algebraic closure $\bar{F}$. This is the same statement as that $V$ is torsion-free over $F[x]$. I think that a torsion module over a PID $R$ behaves much better, if it is the direct sum of its isotypic summands. For instance, if $x$ is locally nilpotent on $V$, then I think that it is a direct sum of Jordan blocks, possibly including infinite Jordan blocks (like the differentiation operator $x = \partial/\partial t$ on $\mathbb{Q}[t]$). 

Many thanks to Allen in turn for his generous citation to me. What I had to say is fairly standard, yet I don't think that I'd ever be able to write a book like Hatcher's Algebraic Topology. Here is a link to the appendix that Allen wrote. Here is the situation in a nutshell. A simplicial set has a small realization. It is a CW complex made of non-degenerate simplices of the simplicial set. The simplices can be glued to themselves or multiply glued to each other. However, the simplicial set structure also implies that the corners of each simplex are consistently locally ordered, and this is not possible with an arbitrary gluing. The consistent local ordering is useful for a variety of purposes. The first time that you'd really care is that it gives you a canonical cup product at the level of simplicial chains. Geometric topologists, especially 3-manifold topologists, widely use of exactly this structure, except without the consistent local ordering. This is called a generalized triangulation, and you can express it in much the same way as a simplicial set. Instead of using the simplex category, whose morphisms are order-preserving maps between ordered finite sets, you use the symmetric simplex category, whose morphisms are all maps between all finite sets. The small realization of a symmetric simplicial set is exactly a generalized triangulation, if the symmetric simplicial set satisfies a certain freeness condition. The symmetric group $S_n$ acts on the set of formal $n$-simplices, and the condition is that the action on the non-degenerate one should be free. Symmetric simplicial sets appear in a bare handful of papers in the literature. Every generalized triangulation with consistently locally ordered vertices is represented by a unique simplicial set. This is harmonious view of simplicial sets to make both algebraic and geometric topologists happy. The only problem is that it does not generalize well to other simplicial objects, because the non-degenerate simplices aren't any good in, for instance, a simplicial group. Simplicial sets are very useful to algebraic topologists. Generalized triangulations are very useful to geometric topologists. Simplicial complexes are useful to combinatorialists: they are hypergraphs with a closure property. Simplicial complexes are not as useful as natural generalizations to either algebraic or geometric topologists: simplicial sets if you order the order the vertices; or generalized triangulations if you don't order the vertices. It is true that certain constructions of simplicial set or generalized triangulations are automatically simplicial complexes. For instance the simplicial set of a poset is automatically that (as Charles Rezk says), or the second barycentric subdivision of any type of CW complex that has a barycentric subdivision. (Because the first barycentric subdivision is automatically a simplicial set with colored vertices.) 

Let $M$ be a smooth, compact $n$-manifold with a stable framing. Then Pontryagin's map works like this: 

Probably the right thing to do is to express the classifying space of $A_n$ as the non-trivial double cover of the classifying space of $S_n$. A point in the classifying space is then a set of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^\infty$ with a "sign ordering". A sign ordering is an equivalence class of orderings of the points, i.e., ways to number them from 1 to $n$, up to even permutations. I coined the term "sign ordering" by analogy with a cyclic ordering. But that name aside, the idea comes up all the time in various guises. For instance an orientation of a simplex is by definition a sign ordering of its vertices. This is in the same vein as your other examples and you can of course do something similar with any subgroup $G \subseteq S_n$. You can always choose an ordering of the points up to relabeling by an element of $G$.
