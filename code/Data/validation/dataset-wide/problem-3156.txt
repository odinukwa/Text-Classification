I believe Romania's chief misfortune during the Middle Ages was to be right next to Eurasian Steppe, in an era when settled communities really had no military answer to the expert horse archers that steppe country naturally incubated. 

As fate would have it, while I'm typing this answer, Jared Diamond is on NPR delivering his critique of a new book on exactly this topic. The book is Why Nations Fail, by Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson. Diamond was fairly critical, but still you might consider checking it out. Otherwise, you could consider reading his own book on the subject: Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed. 

*emphasis mine The typical methods used were poll taxes and literacy tests. Both tended to include grandfather clauses that gave a free pass if you were related to someone eligible to vote the year before slavery was abolished (a clever, if transparent, bit of legal trickery). In practice, both tended to be selectively applied to only black applicants. It didn't stop there though, in addition to numerous other onerous requirements, in Alabama you got "doxed" as well: 

Let's go through your major metro areas there: Seattle - This city is on a bay. Technically, not inland at all. Its a nice deep enclosed bay, which is historically a really good place to put major port cities, because your port facilities are relatively sheltered from the violence of the open ocean that way. Compare this to Baltimore, which is on an arm of the Chesapeake Bay. Both cities might appear "inland" if you zoom your map out far enough. Portland - About 100 miles upriver (and 60 miles inland) from the Pacific on the Columbia. This is comparable to the port of New Orleans, which is 105 miles upriver on the Mississippi from the Gulf of Mexico. Since both cities are on the largest river in North America that empties into their respective sides of the continent, the comparison is a particularly apt one. You could argue none of the rest of Oregon is really that "major". What they do have (eg: Salem, Eugene) is generally strung along the Wilamette River, which happens to run north for a long stretch until it merges with the Columbia near Portland. There are some inlets along the coast that look like they might have been good spots for a port, but none of them happen to be on a river that's anywhere near the importance of the Columbia. Much of the same goes for Washington (and a couple more inland states and provinces). What other mid-sized cities exist in the Pacific Northwest are mostly upriver from Portland on the Columbia river system. 

I heard a few interviews with an author of a book that went into this subject on the NPR circuit a few years back. Sadly, I didn't pick it up, and don't remember the book's name now. I do vaguely remember hearing that when it was going around, so many people were sick (not to mention dying), that in a lot of places society hit a kind of tipping point and basic services started to break down. Trash could no longer be collected, bodies weren't getting buried, etc. From surfing around Amazon, the best book that I can find that goes into the societal aspects is America's Forgotten Pandemic: The Influenza of 1918. It covers the USA rather than Ireland, but it was a truly global pandemic, so it should give you an idea. 

It seems most likely to me it would have been a local Sept leader, or at best a Earl or Laird, who got run out of his territories in the course of typical Scottish infighting. Over generations of retelling this guy could easily have been eventually promoted all the way to a "King", as it makes the family's origins sound more respectable. You would be positively amazed how many people in the USA claim descent from a Cherokee princess (the Cherokee don't even have royalty). An event very much like this, known as the Flight of the Earls, happened in 1607. Another page I found talks of issues with "Scottish mercenaries" in Ireland prior to 1570. If we assume that Ireland wouldn't have been the only victim of this activity, your "king" could well have been one of those mercenary leaders. 

As for the ancient Iranians, our first record of them moving into their ancestral homeland is around 800 BC. At that point they likely physically resembled other early Indo-Europeans. The question is what that was. It is surprisingly difficult to find references to studies of physical appearance outside of sketchy sites pushing racial agendas. What I did dig up tended to agree that skin and hair color appears to have undergone a surprising amount of selection pressure, meaning that these would be among the absolute first features to evolve to match what works best at the latitude a people are living. So skin color is actually about the worst thing to look at to ascertain relations between peoples. The best I was able to dig up was this Science story. I could be misinterpreting, but it appears to be saying that the PIE people who moved into Europe carried multiple light-skin traits, one of which nearly disappeared in central Europe, but later came back into prominence amongst those that proceeded into northern Europe. The PIE people also appeared to have a tendency to be a bit taller. Exactly how fast this process evolves I'm not sure. However, Cyrus was only about 2 centuries removed from the Iranian descent into their homeland, so I'd think it fairly likely he was a bit fairer than your typical human being living in the subtropics. But we really don't know. 

This is actually a subject of much debate. More interestingly, the answer depends on which Gospel account you are reading*. For the Synoptics, the Last Supper is the key. They report it as a Passover meal, which by definition puts it on 14 Nisan. The crucifixion is (strongly implied at least) the next day, so 15 Nisan. For John, its Jesus' trial that clues us in. It occurred on the Day of Preparation prior to Passover, placing the crucifixion itself on 14 Nisan. This chronology may have been influenced by a desire in John to equate Jesus to the traditional Passover sacrifice (the Paschal Lamb)2 As for the day of the week, all four Gospels agree it was a few hours before the start of the Sabbath (IOW: a Friday). 1 - Sadly for the literalists, there are rather a lot of inconsistencies between the four different Gospels. Generally a believer has to either ignore the scholoarly research, or dump literalism. 2 - John was the latest of the Gospels written. For historians that makes it the least certain. However, it is easily the most poetic. 

Sadly, this bit does not appear to be referenced. I found a lot of references to an extreme rate of attrition in horses during the war (a 5x higher rate than the humans, supposedly), which makes one wonder how the Southern approach could possibly work. Civilwar.com elaborates on this a bit: 

Logically there are only two legit sources this story could come from if true; the two participants. As the brick-chucker does not strike me as a man of letters (and is far from the hero in this story), I think its reasonable to rule him out. That leaves Wesley himself. The problem there, as both the question and another answer have alluded to, is that Wesley kept extensive journals of his life, and this is certainly the kind of thing that would be in an entry had it happened. And yet it is not. So this almost certainly has to be a fanciful invention. If you know anything about Wesley, it reads like a joke as well. One important thing to know about the man is that praying was as natural as checking the Twitter feed might be to a modern person. He claimed to spend 2 hours every morning in prayer (a habit he got from his mother). So the only thing surprising about him stopping for prayer in this story would be that he didn't manage to come across and address any crisis of conscience already in those two hours that morning. The other thing is that he very often had to contend with angry mobs, including at least once actually being hit by a brick. So the dude hucking the masonry at him would certainly be in character too. Another thing that struck me about this story is the archaic form of it. It may just be a joke, but it looks like a pretty old one. I ran ngrams on the words "interceding" and "backslidden", and the phrase "rough fellow", and the result showed all three peaking in use back in the 1800's. If one were to join the curves, the most likely authorship date would be sometime in the vicinity 1860.* For what its worth, this corresponds roughly with the period sometimes referred to as the Third Great Awakening in the USA. In the Wesleyan sphere, the big happening at this time was the Holiness Movement. It turns out J.G. Morrison was a Methodist (Wesleyan) preacher active from the 1890's, who was indeed part of the Holiness Movement, and eventually split off with his compatriots into the Nazarene Church. So the timing is certainly consistent with that wording of the story being his work. * - spoiling this line of reasoning a bit is that the setting of this story would be the 1740's but ngrams get unreliable before 1800 due to the small sample sizes. There are some interesting spikes back there if you try it anyway. So its quite possible this joke could even have been contemperanious 

At the end of the movie Fiddler on the Roof, the Russian Jews are shown leaving in a train of wagons. I always pictured a wagon trail running West, much like in the USA in the 1800's (but in much less happy circumstances of course). Its just a movie of course. Hollywood movies aren't exactly renowned for historical scholarship. However, it was made in 1971 with the involvement of quite a few Jewish folks who would have most likely had access to older relatives who had made this exact journey. 

Going further back, you get your first clue here. Goidelic languages in the 4th century were not all that far removed from the Gaulish being spoken in today's France. Gaulish in turn is an Indo-European language of the Western branch. Indo-European is generally presumed to have been native to somewhere in the eastern european or west asian steppe. So presumably when the Indo-Europeans moved into Western Europe, their language became Celtic (or "Gaulish"), and when the Gauls moved into the British Isles, their languages became Goidelic in Ireland and Brythonic in England (and perhaps Pictish in Scotland). 

It sounds a lot like you are looking for The Arab Tyrant's Manual. Its observational, but contains a lot of real-world strategy tips for dealing with pesky democratic agitators at all levels. There's also of course the classic The Prince, by Machiavelli. It was arguably a bit more serious, however, it didn't have to deal so much with competition from democratic ideals. 

You're looking for the term quisling, which is an adjective to describe someone (or a government or group of people) being a toady, particularly with respect to someone they should be standing up to. The term comes from Vidkun Quisling, who ran the Norwegian government during WWII. When the Nazis invaded, he actually helped them take over the country, and as a reward got to run it for them for a while. Churchill responded by making the man's name a byword for treason. 

If you read a bit between the lines, it appears that the faith was strongest amongst the nobility and financial elite, and never really made big inroads with the peasantry. The problem was that the 17th century was also the period when King Gustav's Swedes swooped into central Europe, conquering much of northern and western Poland. There was a religious dimension to the conflict, such that Calvinists and Lutherans tended to side with the Swedes. That worked well for them while the Swedes held their territory, but no so much when Swedish forces lost the war and went home. In the aftermath anyone who had supported the Swedish-led protestant forces was viewed as disloyal. After that, discriminatory laws became much more acceptable, and some of the more radical protestant sects were banned outright. The result was that Poland became one of the more notable successes of the Counter-Reformation. 

Cincinnatus is sort of the prototypical example. He was elected dictator of Rome in 458 BC to deal with a military emergency, and again the following year to deal with a plot against the republic. Both times he gave up dicatatorial powers as soon as the crisis had been dealt with, and went back to his farm. This had a great influence on the founding fathers of the USA. The post of President was designed to be able to carry out a simliar role in an emergency. The post is designated as supreme commander of all US armed forces, and is allowed in times of military crisis to suspend Habeus Corpus. George Washington was often referred to as "Cincinnatus", and the city of Cincinnati, Ohio was named after him. During the US Civil War, there was open debate about whether a similar dictator might be required. However, the powers given the President in the Constitution proved to be sufficient without taking such an overt step.
