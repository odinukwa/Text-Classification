The moment you believe that an avenue of approach is not useful and not worth defending is the moment when a good strategist will use that particular approach to your disadvantage. Tunneling is labor-intensive, aimed against fixed locations, and best used where there isn't a lot of underground infrastructure, e.g., sewer lines, power lines, and natural gas conduits. It would not work well against a mobile enemy or a location with potentially dangerous underground infrastructure. 

The Wikipedia article on M. Gerasimov requests a citation. The source cited in the Tamerlane article is a news article from 2006 that mentions the prophecy as hearsay. Unless something else comes out, we have no proof that this isn't fabricated. 

Semaphore pointed out historical examples. I believe the context (thank you for providing the link) also helps. The following are all quotes from that same speech. 

Being caught in a terrible war, the enemy is evil (even if he also claims to be Christian) and any technology or science he uses is considered a perversion of that technology and science. 

The Ku Klux Klan is a Christian terrorist group because they engaged in acts of terror. They burned down churches and executed people they considered harmful to their vision of Christian and American ideology. There still exist people who claim to be Christians and forbid interracial marriages. There still exist people who claim to be Christians and claim white supremacy. There still exist people who claim to be Christians and harbor significant anti-Semitic sentiments. When these people act on those beliefs to terrorize other people by threatening politicians who support racial equality, to burn down black churches, or to hang Jews from a tree, they become Christian terrorists. While the Ku Klux Klan may have harbored anti-Semitic sentiments, they are best known for their anti-Negro sentiments. There was a common teaching in the 19th Century that white men were the descendants of Seth, Negroes were the descendants of Ham, and Asians were the descendants of Japheth. They saw the domination of the Negroes (Ham) and the incursions of the Asians (Japheth) as fulfillment of the prophecy of Noah that Canaan (a son of Ham) would serve Seth and that Japheth would live in the tents of his brothers. This educated their ideology of white supremacy. This ideology of white supremacy turned into violence and terrorism after the Civil War. The Negroes were now equals to white men and the KKK felt that this was a violation of the Biblical prophecy, so they acted to suppress the freedmen and their allies. Per the Wikipedia article that you referenced, you see that they threatened and assassinated Negro politicians. This is similar to the actions we hear about on the news performed by Al Qaeda, ISIL, the Taliban, and other terrorist groups in the Middle East. 

I would recommend a read through Janet Abu-Lughod's book, Before European Hegemony. This covers trade routes and practices in different areas of the world during the late 14th through early 16th centuries. The remainder of this answer is pulled in great part from what I understood of the book. Water ways are preferred due to a lower rate of banditry. While piracy was common in the Mediterranean, it wasn't as common in the Indian Ocean. The Italians, particularly the Genoese and the Venetians, would have a convoy to protect the merchandise and harried each other's ships. Numbers mean a lot. Most pirate enterprises can't afford more than one ship and joint operations are difficult to orchestrate. Whenever you get two different groups with two different goals, e.g., "Whose purse are we filling?" you end up with a separation of interest. If a merchant convoy is large enough, it would be a significant deterrent to a pirate with only one or two ships. Land routes don't have such simple limitations. People are typically land-bound; that's our natural habitat. We don't need to have a ship to carry loads on land. We don't need to have a ship to afford us shelter on land. Because of this, it is much easier to have a larger band with which to attach merchant convoys. Thus, land routes had a higher rate of banditry and it would take greater numbers to deter bandit attacks. Why are deserts safer? The deserts are harder on travel and sustenance. If you're traveling through the desert, you're traveling with enough to sustain your journey to the next watering hole or trade post. If you're a bandit in the desert, it's more difficult to sustain yourself between raids. During the late 13th and early 14th centuries, there were four towns in the area of Champagne which had regularly scheduled and rotating fairs. The fair would stay in each town for a couple of months before moving to the next. Each town encouraged trade of particular wares, so merchants interested in buying or selling particular items would know when to be where. For the fairs to be successful, the lords of these towns and their surrounding areas had to secure the safety of the merchants traveling to the fairs. When this guarantee was no longer provided, the merchants sought other venues. Europe was behind the times, though. Note that the title of the book clearly indicates a time before Europe dominated world trade. The Italians, being closer to the traders from the Middle East (and discouraging direct trade between the rest of Europe and the Middle East), were more familiar with many of the trading practices of the Middle East. This included loan instruments and various forms of housekeeping. Often, there would be a partnership between merchants. The one partner, usually the one with more invested financially, would stay in a shop or warehouse in the home town while the less invested financially would invest his safety into acquiring and transporting goods. In the Indian Ocean, there were a few cities that became merchant cities. The weather patterns in the Indian Ocean prescribed travel in particular directions. Merchants could only practically travel east in the spring and west in the fall. During the summer, they would set up shop in the area of Sumatra and, during the winter, set up shop near the straits leading either into the Persian Gulf or the Red Sea. In short, the book covers key elements to a healthy economy and illustrates them several times. A healthy economy requires safety at home, safety to produce materials beyond what is necessary to subsist. A healthy economy requires safety along trade routes, safety to travel to a buyer willing to purchase your excess. A healthy economy requires a consistent schedule, safety to know that, when you get to your buyer, your buyer will be able to purchase your excess. 

Over and over again, Churchill addresses the losses they have suffered and the dangers they face from Germany's military might. These losses would not be so severe if German technology were not on par with that of the Allied powers. 

The upper classes who stayed wealthy did so because of their economic practices. The global economy today is a recent invention; economies tended to have less interaction on a broader scale in the past. Thus, there was an even more immediate feel of the zero-sum game (my gain comes from your loss) in ancient times. One way for a person to make the initial climb above his neighbors was to charge interest or, if he was in the right position, tax. One charging interest on a loan makes money simply because he had some money to begin with, not because he is actively doing anything with it. Experts agree that interest rates in ancient times were quite steep. If someone in the village had a good harvest and his neighbor had a poor one, the one who was better off could loan his neighbor some of the produce and charge interest when it was paid back. This was one of the ways people got the upper hand at the beginning. Considering that most people grew little surplus, this meant, eventually, that the lender all but owned the land his debtor worked for him. This obviously balloons. The lender is able to lend out more money and collect more interest. With careful exploitation, he eventually has everyone in the village indebted to him and receives a portion of everyone's harvest without having to do any work himself. The upper classes didn't always stay wealthy. Those who stayed wealthy were the ones where the heirs paid attention to how their ancestors acquired and maintained their wealth. I diverge a little, but it was the intent of the Mosaic law to prevent this exploitation. Debts were forgiven every seven years, slaves were freed every seven years, and lands were returned every fifty years. It was an economic reset to prevent class disparity. 

Confused Yet? This is the source of the confusion. While the historians gave us some clues by lining up the reign of the monarch in the Northern Kingdom with the reign of the monarch in the Southern Kingdom, the Northern Kingdom no longer existed by the time of the second siege of Jerusalem. Historians have done their best to line up the reigns of the monarchs of the Southern Kingdom with the reigns of kings from other kingdoms, such as Babylon. Whenever they try to do this, they still have to examine all the information in order to answer those two questions: "Accession or Non-accession?" "Nisan or Tishri?" Take another look at the Wikipedia article at the top of this answer. Thiele is assuming an accession year count where Albright does not. They both agree that the year started on Tishri 1. 

Wikipedia - Siege of Jerusalem All of the contemporary records, whether Hebrew or otherwise, rely on regnal dating systems. There are two points of confusion, particularly when dating the reigns of Israelite or Jewish kings: which calendar is used and when does the first year start. I'll try to clarify farther down using Queen Elizabeth II as an example. Religious or Secular Year? The Hebrew historians used two different calendars and, to some extent, continue to do so today. Some historians used the religious calendar, which starts in the spring with the first month, Nisan. Passover is Nisan 14. Some historians used the secular calendar, which starts in the fall with the seventh month, Tishri. Rosh Hashanah ("New Year") or Yom Teruah ("Day of Trumpets") is Tishri 1. Regardless of which calendar was used, Nisan was the "first month" and Tishri the "seventh month". In similar fashion, whether we use the calendar year (January - December) or an arbitrary fiscal year (July - June), January is still January and July is still July. Unlike the British, the historians of the Bible always started the year at one of these two points: Nisan 1 or Tishri 1. British historians start the regnal year with the date of accession. For Queen Elizabeth II, then, the British regnal year starts on 6 Feb every year. Accession or Non-Accession? Some historians used an "accession" regnal year. From the date of ascension to the last day of the year, the regent served the "accession" year. The first day of the calendar year following that began the regent's first year. Other historians used a "non-accession" regnal year. From the date of ascension to the last day of the year, the regent served the first year. The first day of the calendar year following that began the regent's second year. Applied to Queen Elizabeth II Let's put this in perspective of a modern calendar with Queen Elizabeth's reign. We'll presume two calendars: the calendar year (roughly equivalent to the religious year) and the fiscal year (starting on July 1, roughly equivalent to the secular year). 

Land ownership has historically been hereditary and Richard Horsely writes in his book, Covenant Economics, that it was an "inalienable right" for a person to live on and work his father's land. He also indicates that the land actually belonged to the community, that the family were just tenants and caretakers of the land. They lived in houses on the land and it was common practice for a new groom to build an annex to the family home in preparation for his marriage. The Ottoman Land Code of 1858 required all lands in the Ottoman Empire to be registered. The hereditary tenure system was partially abolished. Some tenants were unaware of this new law. Other tenants refused to register the land, whether because it would obligate them to military services or because they didn't want to or couldn't pay the taxes and fees associated with registration. Some tenants did end up registering their hereditary land. Others delegated a representative for the community, of which some faithfully registered the land to the various members of the community and others registered the land in their own name. Finally, a few particularly unscrupulous people registered lands they had no rights to and became absentee landlords. Whether all the land was registered or not is unclear based on the sources immediately available to me. In 1873, the Ottoman Empire passed another land reform that clearly allowed Jews to own land in Palestine. The Zionist movement reacted to this by buying land throughout Palestine. The Zionists were purchasing deeds to these lands, but they weren't necessarily buying them from the tenants. By 1948, Jews owned deeds claiming about 7% of the land in Palestine. When the Mandate of Israel was formed, the British Empire recognized the deeds issued by the Ottoman Empire. The Jews continued to purchase land in Israel. When the State of Israel formed, many Arabs fled and Israel passed the Absentees' Property Law, reallocating the land that was abandoned. According to this Wikipedia article, some 70% of the land in Israel could have been doubly claimed by a deed from the Mandate of Israel and a deed granted by the Absentees' Property Law. 

Dick Henry provides a Julian calendar year-at-a-glance view going back to 46 B.C. on his website, but it abides by the timing specified by the papal bull "Inter gravissimas", so it doesn't show you O.S. dates after A.D. 1582. Petko Yotov provides a side-by-side year-at-a-glance view extending into the future, going back to A.D. 1582, and providing a Julian calendar year-at-a-glance back to A.D. 1. 

A question of this sort is going to generate a lot of opinion, so there may not be a definitive answer or you'll have a lot to sift through. I expect Canada didn't "emerge as a power" because Canada didn't want to. The Game of Empires Spain started grabbing land in the New World in the late 1400s and 1500s. The Portuguese similarly started grabbing land in the Indian Ocean in the 1500s. The other sea-going European powers (particularly Britain, France, and the Netherlands) also started grabbing land around the world. Italy and Germany didn't unite until the late 19th century. The Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman, and Russian Empires were pretty contiguous and had their own limitations to expansion. The United States didn't really emerge as a power until it started realizing imperial ambitions in the late 1800s. Yes, the U.S. pushed westward, taking and buying land from Spain, France, and Britain, and this was pushed by public opinion (see "Manifest Destiny"). By the time the U.S. was contiguous from Atlantic to Pacific, public opinion was primarily isolationist; the politicians that wanted more land had to spin the truth so the people might accept that it wasn't a land grab. Similarly, when it formed in 1871 in the wake of (or as a result of) war with one of the Great Powers, the German Empire realized it was late coming to the Game of Empires. Fueled by public opinion (or, at least, several of Germany's leaders), German still reached out and grabbed some land in Africa and some islands in the Pacific. By the time Canada became independent and was able to dictate its own foreign policy, World War I had ended with horrific consequences for the European players in the Game of Empires. (The U.S. and Japan weren't as badly affected.) I expect that, in reflecting on World War I, Canada didn't want to join that particular game. The Game of Money While the land area of Canada is slightly larger than that of the United States, its location further north has prevented Canada having a population to compare with the United States. Most, if not all, of the major population centers in Canada are in the south, often within 100 miles of the border with the United States. Many of the exceptions would be on the Atlantic Coast, where the Gulf Stream makes for milder climates. Canada has plenty of natural resources. Canada also has the infrastructure and technology to compete with the other nations on the financial market. Canada's location, however, makes it more difficult to extract those resources. It's not impossible, of course, just more difficult. The history of rail building in Canada has a couple of particular dark periods for the government economically. Rail is one of the most efficient means to get natural resources to refineries. Again, Canada probably could become a bigger player on the financial market if the right people tried hard enough.
