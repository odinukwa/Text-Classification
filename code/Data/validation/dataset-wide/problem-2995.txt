This is how mathematical induction works: You show that a statement is true for N = 1. Then you show that for every N ≥ 1: If the statement is true for N, then it is true for N + 1. It follows that the statement is true for all N. In this case the statement is: There are at least N cities. You showed the statement for N = 1 (by quoting Berlin, Germany). You showed the induction step (if the statement is true for N, then it is true for N + 1) for N = 1 (San Francisco) and for N = 2 (Stockholm). You didn't give the slightest bit of evidence that the induction step would be true for every N. Therefore you gave no evidence that there is an infinite number of cities. 

There are a priori three possibilities: 1. There is no god. 2. There is a god, and it doesn't want humans to prove its existence. 3. There is a god, and it wants humans to prove its existence. Quite obviously, in cases 1 or 2 we won't be able to prove god's existence in any way, including physics (there may be proof attempts that can be more or less easily debunked), and in case 3 there will be proof, which may be physical. There is no proof forthcoming so far, so I conclude that one of (1) or (2) is the case. Which isn't very enlightening :-) 

Gödel's incompleteness theorem is often grossly misinterpreted when the subject of intelligence and artificial intelligence are discussed. His theorem states that there are mathematical statements that cannot be either proven or disproven. A computer looking for a proof would fail to find one. A computer looking for a proof and not giving up would be stuck. But a brilliant mathematician looking for a proof would also fail to find one. And if that mathematician didn't give up, he or she would also be stuck forever. He found that are problems that are impossible for any computer to solve. The same problems, however, are impossible for a human to solve as well. Some people seem to think that an unsolvable problem would cause problems for an artificial intelligence. But surely any artificial intelligence worth the name would be capable of figuring out that a problem is hard, too hard for it to solve, and then like humans would do the only recourse is to give up. 

Two sides have made an argument. They disagree in a single point. Since they disagree in a single point, at least one side must be wrong. They cannot both be right yet disagree in a single point. So if you examine both sides' arguments, and you tell us that both sides have a point, then you haven't examined the arguments well: One side, possibly both, are wrong, but you haven't figured out which one. You are sitting on the fence, and not passing the test. About alanf's answer: When we make an argument about something, we can make weak or strong arguments. I'll make a weak argument about arithmetic: 2 plus 2 is probably some number or something else. Because this argument is so weak, it is correct, but so weak that it is useless. Now I'll make a strong argument about arithmetic: 2 plus 2 equals π. It happens that this argument is wrong. But it's a strong argument, which means we can examine it and without a shadow of a doubt say whether it is right or wrong. Another weak argument: 2 plus 2 is not a number, but I might be wrong. This is so weak that it is actually true (because I am indeed wrong as I said). It is so weak that our two arguments contradict each other and are still both right. Here alanf says quite rightly that we should reject both arguments. They are two weak. Neither argument is strong enough to refute the other, so we can consider them both wrong. If you examine both arguments, which seem to be contradictory on a single point yet both right, you must call them out on their weakness. You must say tht these arguments are just too weak and therefore can be considered both to be false. If you don't do this, you are sitting on the fence and not passing the test. 

There's no paradox. The genie does whatever the genie wishes to do. When the genie "grants a wish" this doesn't invoke some law of physics where granting the wish becomes inevitable. The most likely outcome is that the genie does nothing, or if A and B agreed between them on their wishes, the most likely outcome is that the genie puts them both into a bottle and throws the bottle in the ocean. 

Fact is that if we could stop the fantasist, it would be immoral to do so. If we stopped him, 1,000 people would die. If we didn't stop him, one person would die. Much better to not stop him. Consequently, if the fantasist has laid out his plan and has prepared everything to kill the bomber, it would be immoral to stop himself and not kill the bomber. That leads me to claim that the fantasist's planning and preparing of the killing of the bomber is the immoral act, not the shooting itself. We have two different actions: One is the fantasists scheming to be able to kill a human being without going to jail for it, the other is the shooting of a bomber, which will save many lives. One if these acts is deeply immoral, they other is not. 

Here's a though experiment: What are tomorrows lottery numbers? The simple answer would be "I don't know (yet)". But instead you could say "the first number is maybe 1, or maybe 2, or maybe 3, ..." and so on. Instead of saying that you don't know, you could say the number is in an overlapping state where it could be any of 49 numbers, with equal probability. Of course, for lottery numbers this is nonsense. However, for electrons this is exactly how they work. And not only in the future, but all the time. An electron circling around an atom isn't at some point circling at a certain speed. It is in a permanent state of being "somewhere around here". It is in one of many places with certain probabilities. But probability is not quite the right way to express it. Imagine you took a photo of a ball swinging around a centre, but leaving the camera lens opened for an hour. On the photo you would see the ball in all different places, but brighter in places where it was more often, and dimmer in places where it was more rarely. An electron is a bit like that, but at any single point in time. Now Schrödinger's cat is the result of an experiment where quantum physics is made to control something in the non-quantum physics world. The cat is killed if an electron hits a detector. But an electron, as explained, doesn't hit a detector. It simultaneously hits and doesn't hit, with different probabilities. Therefore the cat is in a state where it is simultaneously dead and alive. It's not either dead and alive but we don't know because we haven't checked, it is both dead and alive at the same time. 

"Unless" specifies a necessary condition. The presence of a lifeguard is necessary to allow using the pool. It is not a sufficient condition: For example, if the lifeguard is present but tells everyone to stay out of the pool, then the use of the pool is not allowed. This is logically the same as "except", but very different from "if and only if". 

Legally you are responsible if you know or should have known. Wilfully closing your eyes doesn't avoid responsibility. The statement here implies at least an awareness of an accusation that slavery was used. Fallacies are about incorrectly drawing conclusion. Here I'd say the premise is false. 

The first question is: If X was present, how likely is it that we would have evidence for it? I claim: There is an elephant in your kitchen. If this claim was true, it would be impossible to not have evidence of it. If there is no evidence of elephants in your kitchen, that's quite strong evidence for the absence of elephants in your kitchen. I claim: There is a tiny and extremely well hidden camera in your kitchen. Here it is quite plausible that evidence is absent, even if the camera is there. So absence of evidence is relatively week evidence for the absence of the camera. The second question is: How likely is it that X is present in the first place (before we started looking for evidence)? That might be difficult to say in some cases, easier in others. If the presence of X is a priori very likely, then the best explanation for absence of evidence is that we didn't look well enough for evidence, or it is hard to find. If the presence of X is a priori very unlikely, then the explanation for lack of evidence is that X is just not present. I claim: "Yesterday, I threw a dice, and the number six came up 12 times in a row". Without evidence, you won't believe it. I claim: "Yesterday, I saw a black car in my street". Even without evidence, you'd probably believe me. 

We think that when we look at truly random events, nothing unlikely will happen. For example, throwing a coin ten times and it landing heads up each time is unlikely to happen, so we think it isn't going to happen. But in reality, there are two things against us: One, unlikely events will happen, just not very often. Ten coins in a row landing head up will happen about one in thousand times. Things that are more likely and that we still consider unlikely will happen more often. If something is so unlikely that it has only a one in fifty chance to happen, then during the 50 coin throws mentioned it is quite reasonable to expect that it happens once. Two, there are many things that are very unlikely. Like 10 heads in a row, but also ten tails in a row, 5 heads followed by 5 tails or vice versa, alternating between heads and tails, and so on. That greatly increases the chances that something very unlikely will happen. If we can think of 20 things that each have a one in thousand chance to happen, then we can expect one of these twenty things to happen during just 50 coin throws. So when we are asked to simulate coin throws, we will tend to avoid patterns that seem unlikely to happen, not aware that unlikely looking patterns are not really that unlikely. 

Practical and completely non-philosophical refutation: If one of my children makes this argument to me, I'll slap them around the face and blame it on my parents. Practical refutation 2: Police officers, bosses, judges etc. don't accept that argument so it won't help you much. Practical refutation 3: If you make mistakes, you can blame these mistakes on your parents all you like, but that's not going to improve your situation one bit, so you better do something to improve your life instead of trying to shift the blame. (In practice, this argument often needs to be used when the parents actually might be at fault for the way they raised their child, but the child needs to be reminded that finding someone to blame doesn't actually improve their situation). Philosophical refutation: You may be right, but by claiming that your mistakes were already predetermined at your birth and you had no choice but making them, you give up the right to call yourself a human being. Worse for you, if being born is so awful that you blame your parents for it, that is a fixable problem. (Imagine instead of a child a robot who was created and programmed by a person. That person would have to accept blame for damage caused by the robot, and would probably decide to turn the robot off). Philosphical refutation two: If you claim that your parents are to blame for all the bad things you do, then surely they are the ones to praise for all the good things you do. So when you you get your next salary, you better send that straight to your parents because they deserve it. Philosophical refutation three: Being born is a necessary precondition for you to be able to misbehave, but it's not the cause of your bad behaviour. As evidence, there are millions of people who were also born but don't show the same bad behaviour. Even if it was the cause, we pass blame only for foreseeable consequences of actions. Your misbehaviour was not foreseeable when your parents decided to have a child. So there are two entirely different kinds of refutations: The last one just shows that the argument is wrong. Other refutations say that you may be right, but you haven't quite thought through what the consequences of being right are - and if you are right and think properly about the consequences, you'd be very quiet about this and not draw any attention to it.
