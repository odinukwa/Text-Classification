If you suspect that the faces are out of alignment, you may want to take the frame to your local shop to have the bottom bracket faced. This will cost between $20-$40, and will typically also include the chasing of the bottom bracket threads as well. Finally, you may want to consider a higher quality bottom bracket. The UN-26 is entry-level quality, but if you are riding regularly and/or in inclement weather, it will wear out quickly regardless of installation quality. 

To align the caliper, loosen the caliper bolts and bring the fixed cpad as close as possible to the rotor without rubbing. Then dial in the fixed pad so that it is as close as possible without rubbing. Then install your cable/housing, and begin adjusting. To improve brake feel, pre-stretch your cable before making adjustments. Take the wheel out, out a pad spacer in (Pedro's tire lever works great, or any other non-metal object), and squeeze the lever as hard as you can ten times. This will seat the housing into the ferrules, as well as stretch the cable out. If the pads are sitting in a "V", then the brake pad spring most likely needs replacing. You could also try spreading it open a bit first, but the springs are so cheap that it's worth it just to get new ones. P.S. The Alfine dynamo actually uses loose ball bearings, making it re-packable. It's tricky, due to the wiring connectors, but it's nice to be able to do it yourself. Avid Brake Pad Spring 

I would recommend first checking on what Noah recommended: checking that the crank bolts are tightened down to the proper torque. If they are, I would start with the following steps: 

Yes, they are compatible. As long as you are using a 160mm caliper mount, and a 160m rotor they will work together. There are industry-wide standards for rotor position for front and rear brakes. Like @Carel says above though: make sure your pads are a type that are correct for the rotor (this shouldn't be a problem with HRD rotors, you can use metallic or organic pads on them) and also compatible for the type of riding you are doing. For example, if you are doing tons of downhill with organic pads, you'll wear through them really quickly. 

It really depends which seal is installed in the Charger damper. Rock Shox started with a pretty simple o-ring setup to seal the damper from the lower body and the lubrication oil in there. This caused issues with the damper as some lubricating oil could find it's way inside the damper and cause the bladder to explode. I think at that point they decided to only put 5ml inside the lower leg of the damper side. The replaced the seal with a a blue skf seal which is better and I think allowed 10ml afterwards. If your lower seal of the charger cartridge is not blue you should fill in only 5ml. If it is blue you can use more than that. In any case if you use too much it will add some progression to your fork and can cause other seals to blow due to the higher pressure. 

Most of the times the frames aren't the biggest issue with weight. What's mostly limiting are the wheels. Especially if theses are cheaper 29" wheels you should check the manufacturer for a weight restriction. But in the end it depends on what you mostly ride with the bike. If it is mostly commuting you should be fine. As said before the front shock could also become a problem. 

For delivery in the suburbs I think you won't need a mountainbike as you want something fast for the deliveries. This basically narrows down the question further as most quality bikes for trekking/communting etc. are not build with a rear suspension. Also dropping down the kerb should be something which is absorbed with the body. So we are now to decide if you need front suspension. I don't think it will slow you down as the front suspension doesn't have such a big impact on the terrain you are riding. Another thing to consider is how you gonna transport the deliveries. Are they transported in a backpack or on a back or front rack. If the latter is the case and you want to use a front rack the front suspension is out of the question as the typical forks are not made to be used with a front rack ( you just can't mount them ) In case of a backpack you are good with a suspension fork most likely your hands will be glad you buy one. But what you should consider ultimatly is how much you gonna spend on the bike. If it will be a cheaper bike I would consider buying a bike without a suspension fork as those tend to be pretty crappy. With crappy I mean poor quality of dampinig and high weight so you are better of with a stiff fork. Also if you are doing deliveries your mileage will probably a bit higher so lesser parts which will break are better.
