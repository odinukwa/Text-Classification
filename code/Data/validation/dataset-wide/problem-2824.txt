Perhaps with this groundwork, you can start understanding the examples in Wikipedia's Interpretations of Quantum Mechanics. 

     God =        אֵל = 'el      gods = אֱלֹהִים = 'elohiym However, it is not clear that this damages Lewis' overall argument. For consider that #2 essentially assumes that A = God. It is typically said that God is the standard of what is right and what is wrong; this means he can be compared to that standard, by being identical with the standard. He is, by definition, greater than anyone else, better than everyone else, etc. I detect no contradiction. Is it the case that #2 immediately sets A = God? I claim that the answer is yes, although if A is finite, we should perhaps say A = god. But we are used to there being many different gods, none of whom allow another to be the standard of good and evil: see the Greek pantheon, for example. It seems to me that Lewis would be on board with asserting the following dichotomy:      I. Either you are claiming that you are a god,     II. Or you are claiming there is ≥ 1 god who is not you. It seems fair to say that Lewis would dismiss I. as vacuously false: who would say that? Well, Nietzsche might (I'm not an expert), but surely not the audience to whom Mere Christianity is addressed. Therefore, we are justified in rejecting #2, which lands us at: 

I'm cheating a bit, because from #6 on, I'm really giving specific instances of algebras. Basically, this means that there are a possibly(?) infinite set of combinations of axioms which can be used to generate rules for manipulating numbers. An example would be Clifford algebras. So your question turns on: what is a number? If a number is merely an element of an algebra (roughtly: a set of symbols with rules of how they can be combined to get other symbols), I will answer a tentative Yes. We aren't guaranteed that reality has finite complexity, so it may be that we could be forever discovering new algebras which match new models of nature, and they would bring in new numbers. As an example of how ℍ is useful, consider orientations in three dimensions. An easy way to visualize them is as a location on a sphere, like latitude/longitude. What is your latitude at the North Pole? There is no wrong answer, which means one runs into computational difficulties when one needs to "move through that point". If you fly directly over the North Pole, you are going North one instant, and South the next. Sudden 'flips' like this tend to be very bad, because we very much prefer continuous changes. ℍ avoids such singularities with orientations—pretend that you add "which way you're facing" to latitude/longitude. 

Feyerabend was arguing against methodological dogmatism I suggest a look at Richard J. Bernstein's Beyond Objectivism and Relativism: Science, Hermeneutics, and Praxis. His core thesis is that the dichotomy between 'Objectivism' and 'Relativism' is false. See what he has to say about Kuhn: 

True. Wittgenstein's argument against a private language (simpler wiki version) is relevant: without an external reference which establishes the meaning of signs (words), one does not have a 'language'. This external reference must be external to at least two people in order for actual communication to happen. 

Keeping my response to the original form of the question: I would rate two of the claims in your question as highly dubious. 

Yes to "some progress", with a free will defense like Alvin Plantinga's or Alexander Pruss'. These only allege to rebut the logical problem of evil, leaving the evidential one wide open. Note that a free will defense is weaker than a theodicy. One way to get more progress is to talk about other things a benevolent creator would want, like for his/hers/its creation to form rational beliefs and be able to understand all things, including moral things. Then again, such a creator hopefully doesn't need e.g. Unit 731, which did provide knowledge that we otherwise wouldn't have. Is moral knowledge worth the cost? One can probably construct possible worlds where the answer is 'yes' and some where it is 'no'. 

I'm trying to figure out whether compatibilism (SEP, Wikipedia) is falsifiable, a metaphysic, or something else. One way to get at this is to take a Popperian approach, and ask whether any conceivable observation could prove compatibilism to be false. This is different from proving libertarianism to be true; I would be interested in knowing if it has to be compatibilism or libertarianism, or whether there are other options. One answer I've come across is that if we could show that there is no such thing as 'mind', then compatibilism would be trivially false. That is, suppose that there is too much overlap between my mind and your mind, then the thing that makes a decision is some combination of the two minds, putting into question the idea that individual minds make decisions. I'm skeptical of this type of answer, because it seems to merely beg the question of whether 'mind' was defined properly before getting to compatibilism. It may be interesting to note that dualism does not rescue us from compatibilism, unless we allow [apparent] paradox to reside there, instead of insisting that the logic that applies to particles and fields applies to whatever is in the other realm. There is no reason to suppose that 'reasoning' and 'logic' and 'choice' would be thought of differently in a nonphysical realm. Either the choice was founded in reasoning and observation, or it was random. Or we could say that choices have rational and irrational components. Where would the room for libertarian free choice be found? Surely purely random choices cannot be considered 'libertarian'? Here I'm assuming a dichotomy between compatibilism and libertarianism, which may be in error. Consider this paragraph a search for what might falsify compatibilism, a search which failed. 

Being in a simulation gives one less confidence about the rationality of reality and our ability to [scientifically?] penetrate it to its 'base', or ad infinitum, if it is infinitely complex as David Bohm suggests in Causality and Chance in Modern Physics. Any simulation we do of reality will of necessity be smaller then our own reality, either in complexity or scope. How would creatures inside such a simulation have even equal power to explore reality, as we do? Another argument is that if we are a simulation with a purpose, then those running the simulation may not want us to proceed past a certain technological or scientific point. Such progress may violate the very purpose of the simulation. Imagine, for example, that a company wishes to advertise its product with maximum effectiveness. Well, perhaps it would wish to squash technological innovation which would render its product obsolete. And so, it could run advertising simulation research and squash anything in the simulation which would destroy its utility. 

To assert 1. would threaten to deny freedom; one quick argument is that freedom to choose which ice cream flavor is not true freedom. I presume there are more advanced forms of this argument, but they would depend on you further articulating what you mean by the word 'freedom'. As a heads-up, it is important to understand that there are at least the categories of 'freedom-from' and 'freedom-to'; I have seen many people err by omitting one of those. To assert 2. is to require an accounting for how wrongness would be indicated. One possibility is to say that pain ⇏ suffering, that there is a way to live such that pain is noticed as more of an information signal that can be shut off once the wrongness it indicates is taken care of. Indeed, people with high pain tolerances seem to well-simulate this phenomenon: they can use the information provided by pain [up to a certain level] but not care about it otherwise. Note that insensitivity to pain can be very bad; see for example congenital insensitivity to pain. A more extreme version is CIPA. People with CIP[A] must be very careful, like people with leprosy (it can destroy the nerve architecture). Now, what is suffering but merely prolonged pain, due to those signals being ignored? If that is the case, one must restrict freedom in order to guarantee zero suffering. But this leaves us questioning whether 2. is even a coherent option: for it to obtain, we appear to have to deny a certain kind of freedom, which destroys the very argument we are trying to make. Therefore, it appears that there is no guaranteed method for obtaining freedom ∧ ¬suffering.
