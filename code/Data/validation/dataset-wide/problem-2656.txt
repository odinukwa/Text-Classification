I can't think of a specific term, but the closest one that I remember is called the fallacy fallacy: dismissing an opponent's conclusion as false/unworthy of consideration merely because fallacies were present in their argument. 

It seems to me that the rejection of the validity of induction would cause a deep skepticism in pretty much everything but most prominently in perception. If we can never assume uniformity of nature, then every inference about the future and the future based on the past is invalid. Thus wouldn't the rejection of induction restrict us to only be able to talk validly about our present phenomenal experiences or whatever is directly present in the mind? What are the practical ramifications of rejecting induction? It seems that it would throw us all into intense skepticism. 

From what I've collected, Quine seemed to have solved the problem of non-being by using Russell's theory of definite descriptions through the negation of the x having certain properties/descriptions. However, I hear Kripke rejected Russell's definite descriptions. How did Kripke solve the problem of non-being with his theory of reference? 

As phrased I think the question isn't properly representing the issue. To me the question is "What is my moral obligation to be altruistic." because your sole example is a shared cause, not a personal one. Are you morally obligated to campaign for a cause you believe in? ... absolutely, 100%, if it's a personal one. Isn't personal health, both mental and physical, a cause you believe in? Making a living? Using the recycling bins. Paying taxes despite the dental bills from gritting teeth? How about happiness? If you have a cause to 'keep the world safe (so I can be happier)' then isn't practicing the skill of being happier (mental health) a cause you should champion? (If you think happiness is not a moral obligation then why would any participation in society be one ... putting out the trash, regulating one's emotions, etc. People who practice the skill of happiness don't usually commit crimes, hurt others, etc. Why is happiness not a moral cause we all share?) I think because you do not exist as a Borg you have no moral obligation to be altruistic. You DO have a moral obligation to maintain personal integrity. Very practically speaking this usually means spending whatever altristic time you choose on local causes. Most people are most often more effective making small changes on a small scale. For example a person who refuses to have children (despite wanting them) because the child will increase the carbon footprint of the world is not thinking in a healthy way. 

What I don't quite understand is why the idealist/phenomenalist cannot logically infer that since the room he is in is not collapsing, there must be supports underneath the flooring. My question is this: cannot an idealist/phenomenalist have knowledge of unobserved entities through logical inference from his experiences? 

I am aware that Kant addressed Hume's skepticism on causality, but I don't see anything in his CPR that solves the problems of induction and uniformity of nature in other contexts like everyday life, where Hume's question, "will the sun rise tomorrow?" seems to persist. Exactly how does/would Kant solve the problems of induction (particularly uniformity of nature) in non-causal contexts, if he did at all? I am aware that there has already been a question like this, but I thought the answer to it only addressed induction in the context of causal formulations about the world; in this respect, I think Kant only dodged the problem of induction in causal formulations by solidifying causality as an intuition. Rationalizing your belief that the sun will rise tomorrow and rationalizing your belief that C-fiber firing causes pain seem to be two different things. 

Free will is being able to choose AN alternative. Free will is not being able to choose ANY alternative. Here's an example: How many numbers can you name? Would you not say you can't because there are an infinite number? So here's a new question: How many different choices are available to you right now? Well it's also infinite number of choices is it not? And you might say "Yes, but I can't choose to fly like Superman." to which the reply is that physics has nothing to do with free will because if it did then the question would be moot ... I can't will myself to fly like Superman therefore there's no discussion needed (any more than a discussion of 'why isn't superman real'?) Another opposition to free will is that 'it's the reactions in your brain that effect your choices'. Well, yes ... can one 'be' without having physicality? Just because there is 'influence' doesn’t mean you don’t have free will else the argument would be that reality itself precludes free will! ... which would again render the discussion senseless. My thinking is that consciousness means the capacity to distinguish infinity - that as being is a feedback loop then it's endless recursive. How can self-consciousness be 'bounded'? ... is there some end to the recursive feedback loop that is the 'schema'? of being? 

From what I've gathered, reliabilism states that epistemic justification occurs when someone forms a belief via truth-conducive methods. However, doesn't this fall to the problem of induction? Isn't reliabilism assuming that truth-conducive methods, or methods that have produced true beliefs in the past, will persist to be truth-conducive? 

It seems intuitive to me to think that if there is a basic substance or building block of nature (e.g. fermions and leptons, etc.), then all facts regarding entities comprised of that substance are reducible into facts about instances of said substance. For example, the term "water" is reducible, on a chemical level, to "two hydrogen atoms combined with an oxygen atom via covalent bonds." In turn, this chemical equivalent of "water" is reducible to something like "two sets of identical combinations of subatomic particles combined with another unique combination of subatomic particles via [insert some atomic description of covalent bonds] (I'm no physicist)." I like to think that this process can proceed until we reach the most basic of substances, at which point we would arrive at the most primal description of a phenomena. I think topics of the social sciences are subject to this as well. For instance, "a language" can be reduced to "particular sets of certain reverberations used in certain groups of massive collections of subatomic particles (people) who engage in brain states that correlate both/either artifacts of physical substance and/or brain states with some of those particular reverberations of sound." Obviously, you could go "deeper" in the analysis, but for the sake of time and my sanity, I won't try to do any better; you probably get the idea. That was just my understanding of a typical reductionist project, but I have a feeling that I might have just conflated reductionism with physicalism. My question still stands, regardless: What are some of the problems with reducing natural and social phenomena into facts about the primary substance of which they are all ultimately made of? 

If you are speaking about the death of others, it does matter to people due to common ethics. Since the start of our lives , we have been taught by either religion or culture, that the worst thing that you can do to a man is taking his life and the best you can do to him is saving his life. This is part of the world (all the cultures) scheme of things. Now speaking about the individual's death: It all comes from the self-preservation instinct which ensures that the individuals preserve their own existence. This is the cause of the fear of death which nobody is free from. There is not a single rational reason to fear death. All the reasons that people claim that they fear death because, are from the perspective of the living (Ex: My family needs me, while dead people do not get worried about others). Matter fact, dead people do not have a perspective. This proves that this fear comes from our flesh as an instinct. Conclusion: -The death of others has been purposed throughout the history as an ethical problem by religion, which extended to all cultures even secular ones. -The death of the individual is a problem due to the fear of death, which is irrational due to being an instinct. 

"One must imagine Sisyphus happy". Yep ... because imagining the likely reality would be too painful. I think Camus is using 'severity by opposites'. (I am quoting myself as I don't know the proper term for this.) This means there's no words that carry the weight needed so instead you use words from the opposite end of the meaning spectrum. For example if our waiter asks if we enjoyed our meal, given that the plates are clean, we could say 'inedible ... hated it ... We want our money back and we didn't even pay yet.' The absurdity gives weight to the depiction. Alternatively, nope. Sisyphus has free will and that means one can choose (to pursue) to be happy regardless of the situation. Camus is saying that, conventionally, it's not possible for reality to give us the external circumstances for instant gratification. Every single conscious person, through free-will, can choose to pursue desensitizing themselves to an otherwise unpleasant reality, and possibly, ultimately, learn to love, be happy with, something you previously hated. I will offer the very very dissimilar in scale example of me and broccoli. I hated it until age 30. I forced myself to eat it ... masking it with spices or such, and now it's my favorite veggie, and I also prefer veggies as my main food group (previously being 'junk food').
