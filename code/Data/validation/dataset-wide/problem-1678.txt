There is a so-called "red shift", but it's caused by unreliable exit polls leaning blue, not fraud causing the actual results to shift red. If you had asked whether polls in general showed a Democratic lean compared to the results, you would be getting a very different answer. But since you specifically asked about exit polls, this is all about them. This article, which dates from shortly before the 2008 election, discusses 10 reasons that exit polls aren't reliable. They may be informative, but you can't draw any statistical conclusions from them, even for something as basic as who won. I'll quote sections that specifically address the "red shift" issue below. 

I think it's reasonable to assume that David Sheff did have enough sources for the story of the three attempts at diversifying to justify including them in his book. However, I can't tell you what they are. There's also an interesting reference to them here, where the author is describing Yamauchi's relationship with his daughter 

However, this is attributed to a 2007 Action News Special Report from ABC News via a broken link, so I can't find any further information about it. Is there any evidence that this is a real "unremoveable handprint"? Are there documented attempts at painting over it or proof of the 1930's replacement of the wall? Alternatively, has anyone actually tried to disprove it, and if so, what happened? 

TL;DR Silvergate's choice of examples to introduce his book does not address the quoted thesis at all (that average professionals unknowingly commit felonies), and thus one can assume the whole book fails to support his thesis. 

So both people who voted before election day itself and those who come close to closing time aren't necessarily well represented. I couldn't find any statistics on how these groups tend to vote overall, but they're certainly enough to introduce even more error into the exit poll results (even if they balance out from one year to another). 

Going based on the list of deaths from this source, which provided many of the numbers used in the OP's linked article, it looks like it might be definitional difference, but I can't explain all the numbers. The numbers provided by the IDF are much closer to deaths by gunfire, rockets, explosives and other weaponry, while the "Established" numbers match to just rocket attacks. 

It's a slight exaggeration, but the core appears to be true. Wikipedia has a page on the Hitler family and what happened to it, which sources a lot of its information from The Last of the Hitlers by David Gardner. In that book, he tracks down and interviews the surviving members of the family. First generation Hitler had a sister, a half-brother, and a half-sister who survived into adulthood and could have had children. None of them lived past 1960, although both half-siblings had children. He also had two sister-in-laws. One sister-in-law never married and never had any kids. The other had one daughter, who committed suicide in 1971 (for unrelated reasons). It's highly unlikely there was any sort of "pact" in this generation - all Hitler's siblings (of all sorts) had children or not based on their own lives, and wouldn't have that decision affected by his reputation. Second generation As previously mentioned, Hitler had a niece through Eva Braun who committed suicide before having any kids. The more interesting (and relevant) people are the five children between his two half-siblings. Wikipedia (again) summarizes it as follows: 

Having let some time pass for investigation, the apparent conclusion here is No, it's not credible. A Washington Post article titled "7 papers, 4 government inquiries, 2 news investigations and 1 court ruling proving voter fraud is mostly a myth", which admittedly takes a very strong editorial opinion on the matter, links to exactly what it claims to. Of note are the four government investigations, since they include North Carolina (as asked about) and Kansas (as the state which was running the investigative database): 

There's three parts to this question, which I'll address individually: Can the administrator of a Bitcoin exchange arbitrarily change the exchange rate? Certainly. The exchange software is just software, with all the potential for bugs, easter eggs, back doors, and so on that software is prone to. It would be trivial to add a "Set exchange rate" function to custom-written exchange software. Unlike real-money exchanges, which have some level of oversight by the SEC or it's equivalent in other countries, no one regulates bitcoin exchanges or their software. Does arbitrarily changing the exchange rate steal money from users? Here the answer is more equivocally "yes and no." In order to explain that, I need to start with how an exchange actually works. Generally, no one trades directly with the exchange. Instead: 

Usually, the sites make the claim that it helps with separation anxiety. Is there any research to support this? Does this actually benefit the cat, or is it just something to make the owner feel better about leaving the cat alone? 

There's a great article about the history of circumcision and the arguments on both sides here, (also the core of it (without author's opinion) is excerpted here). It's worth noting that neither Mosaic nor Ars Technica are scholarly journals, nor is this an academic paper - rather, this is science journalism with references. 

Silvergate claims that one of these six was later ruled (in a trial against someone else in the conspiracy) not to constitute a crime. I don't know which one, and without the full book, I can't research this more. Case #3 

TL;DR 18th-century Victorian attitudes towards sex may have generated an interest in circumcision, but late-19th century medical science led to its widespread adoption in the United States. The rest of the world isn't nearly as interested. 

As is often the case, No, but with a grain of truth. There was a tribe which was described in legend as "red-headed cannibals" by the oral history of the Paiute tribe: the Si-Te-Cah. According to their legend, as documented in Fossil Legends of the First Americans (2005) and Sarah Winnemucca of the Paiute tribe in her autobiography (1883), the Paiute fought them and killed them all, possibly by sealing the survivors into Lovelock Cave. However, there is no original source for these cannibals being giants - Winnemucca doesn't even hint at that in her book. From the other end, there were skeletons discovered in Lovelock Cave, and Wikipedia cites one of the original miners' archeological reports saying he found the "body of a man six feet six inches tall.". This is certainly tall but not a giant by modern standards, but could have been in prehistoric times. Additionally, human bones which appeared to have been split for marrow were found, which supports the cannibal legend. However, a lot of the remains are no longer around, due to the lack of care taken with archeological remains in the early 20th century. (One source I found said that one of the skeletons was taken to be ground up for a local lodge's "initiation ritual", for example.) The aforementioned Fossil Legends book suggests that the story of giants
