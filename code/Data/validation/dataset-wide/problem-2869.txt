Take this example, some people have amputated limbs, now does that make everyone praise their intact body? the answer is no.There's a common basic narcissism (not the clinical narcissism) in man, that makes him act as a special one. It goes like this: I'm special, therefore my destiny can not be like that person.The problem is that deep inside you, you do not feel that your current resources can be degraded at any time.My answer is, it's impossible to praise what you have (will never be grasped as a radical idea that shapes your mind) . Now i do not know whether the acknowledging of the insecurity of your resources would bring happiness or dread. (Side note): It seems to me there is a difference between praising our current condition and not condemning our current condition. 

If you are speaking about the death of others, it does matter to people due to common ethics. Since the start of our lives , we have been taught by either religion or culture, that the worst thing that you can do to a man is taking his life and the best you can do to him is saving his life. This is part of the world (all the cultures) scheme of things. Now speaking about the individual's death: It all comes from the self-preservation instinct which ensures that the individuals preserve their own existence. This is the cause of the fear of death which nobody is free from. There is not a single rational reason to fear death. All the reasons that people claim that they fear death because, are from the perspective of the living (Ex: My family needs me, while dead people do not get worried about others). Matter fact, dead people do not have a perspective. This proves that this fear comes from our flesh as an instinct. Conclusion: -The death of others has been purposed throughout the history as an ethical problem by religion, which extended to all cultures even secular ones. -The death of the individual is a problem due to the fear of death, which is irrational due to being an instinct. 

I disagree that faith (as you define it) is a must for optimism. Religious faith is merely an example of faith. You could have faith in any of your cultural business (Say for example, raising good kids or acquiring materials). By your definition of faith, all atheists will be living in despair and lack of possibility, but does that happen? No, because they have faith in something else (Which might be their atheism). That leaves us with the term "Self-esteem" as a better substitute for "Faith". Self-esteem is defined by: The belief of one, that he is part of a meaningful and righteous project (Ex: Communism,Atheism,Christianity or even being a fan for a football team) and a genuine follower of that project (Ex: for Christianity,being a non-sinner). What i want to say in short, is that faith does not have to be literal, as in religious faith, here's where self-esteem comes as a working definition for all forms of faith. That's why most of atheists will not reach despair after abandoning their religion. For the nursing woman example you give: Atheists are not free of the guilt present in the religious, if she's an atheist and her set of moral standards (super-ego) is well-established by the culture or any other non-religious means, she would still be prone to guilt that might a reason to force her to nurse her husband. The fact that religion gives us literal hope (Ex: After life and reward), does not mean that it's the only way to mask the existential anxiety and despair. What i want to stress is that, "faith" is too abstract to be substituted with its concrete daughter "religious faith". 

If my understanding is correct, then Kierkegaard (The Sickness Unto Death) is saying that freedom is impossible. What i understand from reading: Guilt is directly proportional with the realization of freedom. The more realization of the freedom will result in more guilt, in the extreme of that lies depression. This results in guilt hindering this freedom. On the other extreme, the schizophrenic is predetermined and destined to follow a single possibility. Since nobody can choose to become obsessed with a certain possibility and to have pure faith in it, therefore the schizophrenic lacks freedom. Is this correct? 

I think that something that makes humans unique is that we have self-contradicting thoughts. For example, almost universally, we try to reduce manual labor (and hence, the invention of robots, right? :-)). At the same time, we do recognize that physical activity is good for good health and try to include it in our lives. If a robot were to be programmed with such self-contradictions, the program would enter into a circular loop and cannot function. 

Thought, may have "become the means of self-expansion, to act without giving sustenance to the ego, the cause of conflict and sorrow". However, I do not for a moment think that it is the only designed function or outcome of thought. Just as a bad act results from thought, so also a good act. In fact, much of the evil that is done by humans results from thoughtless, impulsive reactions learned from childhood. On the other hand, if were to go through the cognitive analysis of what we are about to do, then, our actions will probably be often different . 

To me, it seems that we are talking of language being subjective. I think it is the dynamic of language and communication. Language is a tool for communication which implies a certain degree of common understanding between the speaker(s)/transmitter(s) and the listener(s)/receiver(s). In the case of "I'm moving", the listeners are assumed to use the Earth as the reference. Isn't every single word an artificial construct? And, they could even mean different things in different languages. If what we call a "leaf" were to be renamed to "fael" tomorrow, would a leaf cease to be what it is? 

First, I would like to present my understanding of some of the terms. Countries are geo-political entities, that were defined by specific individuals. Not everyone gets to define their own country or other countries. Also, the definition of countries change over time. Illegal entry refers to the entry into a country without in a manner contrary to an entry defined by the law of the country. In a representative democracy, the law, also, is usually defined by certain individuals, and not be everyone. Poverty is a lack or deficiency of personal needs. The amount of money, which is used to fulfill these needs in capitalist societies, is often used as an indicator of poverty. "Poor resources" and "poorly managed moderate resources" are contradictory in that the former refers to "poor resources" and the latter "moderate resources". Similarly, "rich resources" and "better managed moderate resources" are contradictory in that the former refers to "rich resources" and the latter "moderate resources". For argument's sake, let us first consider that the countries have "poorly managed moderate resources " and "better managed moderate resources". The management of resources, again, rests not equally on all individuals in a country. It follows, therefore, that not everyone participates in the definition of "countries", "laws", and "management of resources". At the end of the day, if an individual is in so much poverty (has very little money), then the definitions become irrelevant to the individual's happiness and the individual does not conform to them anymore. This could possibly be the background of individuals who enter a country illegally. I have not experienced it firsthand, so my statements are only conjectures. The "members of a population from Country B" (let's call them, Population B), who may conform and live by the definition of "countries", "laws", in general and their country and their laws, in particular, would probably think that it is the illegal entry of the "members of a population from Country A" (let's call them Population A) is not just illegal, but also unjust. Thus, the tricky part is to find a solution that would both address the poverty of Population B as well as the illegality and injustice against Population A. Now, let us analyze the next statement regarding the resources and their management. In a globalized world, resources (materials, finished goods, and knowledge) are exported and imported among different countries. The price is determined by the buying country and the selling country, demand, and supply. Thus, even countries with less resources can be rich, depending on what type of resources they have. Once they have an economic advantage, it is easier to build upon the economic advantage more and more. The exports and imports are controlled by individuals who manage the resources. By exporting resources to other countries, these individuals gain economic benefits. However, it results in more and more poverty of Population B. Thus, we can see that if all populations would like to conform to geo-political boundries identified as the countries, and avoid illegal immigration, then
