I know that specialized uses a custom wheel from fulcrum racing that leaves them with a unique numbering system not found on the Fulcrum site. Backstory is that i have 4's on one bike and 6's on another. As I plan to sell the older of the two bikes I want to keep the better of the two wheel sets. 

Running 1x9 is a great idea. I have done it with relatively good success. There were always times on big rides i wish i had a granny.I also intially had issues on chain drop. Because the 9 speed rear, bumpy and rocky terrain can knock the chain off when the derailleur would slap. To prevent chain drop on the front, you can run a bash guard, and an N-gear jump stop on the inside. 

Both the 7.5 and 7.7 are great bikes. An alternative would be a Specialized Sirrus. I have owned 2 Sirrus' and loved them. I only upgraded to a Specialize roubaix so i could participate in competitive road biking. The difference between the 7.5 and 7.7 is pretty big. 7.7 has much better road worthy components and will be several pounds lighter. 

Yes, assuming they are both remote capable. Rockshox uses the same lockout on all the models I have seen. Should be no issue and will only take a small allen wrench. You will likely need to remove the grips, brake lever and shifter from your left handlebar. IF the new fork is not capable you may need a remote lockout top cap, which is a bigger question. 

If the child's bike has a quick release front wheel, you could also use a universal fork mount bolted to a rear bike rack. Then just hang the front wheel on the kids bike with a bungee cord. 

most mid level and up brakes / levers will offer 75% or better power from the hoods. Max brake power from the drops. The handle bar position is critical on long rides to offer 3 or so different hand positions. Start with the hoods level, to just above level and move around from there. I tend to micro adjust them as i get comfortable on a new bike. Seat height, frame size, stem length all play a factor in finding that sweat spot. 

Craftsman robo grips pliers. Kind of a cross between channel locks and vice grips. They really help with enough force and grip to get broken bolts lose. 

Also worthy of note, the riders are still human - maybe they SEEM super human, but i promise they are still human. So at the end of the day, humans have limits, TDF shows this every year in the highlights and low light reels. 

Fetish bikes are a white label brand out of Taiwan. Most of their bikes change year to year and rarely have any identifying markings to a model outside a sticker (which is not applied when shipped, leaving it optional for the first owner to apply). Honestly it may not ever truly be identified. If you need a replacement part or repair, it's best to take it to a bike shop for the proper part analysis if you don't know what you are looking at. 

Most modern disc brakes (mechanical or hydraulic) can be aligned by loosening the caliper from the frame or fork, grabbing the brake hard, and re-securing the bolts. Then once you let go of the brake, it should be centered. Not ideal for the trail, but easy in the garage. 

Premium cleats are a harder material, and will last longer than the cheaper brass cleats. both fit the same, and both offer the 15 or 20 degree float option based on mount position. 

The BB and head tube are some of the thickest carbon parts. Listen to sound differences around it, but I think these areas would be some of the last places to crack. Most cracks would occur either at a junction, thin spot, like middle of the down tube. Also, if the crack you see has no marring, chipping or other damage on either side, its probably superficial. Cracks caused by outside forces (impact) would leave other evidence on the paint, like scuffs, chips, etc. 

We have a prius. It averages 46mpg on our normal driving trends, but 48mpg on long stretches of 65mph trips with the roof rack, but empty. Example test: 1 road bike, with a round tubed roof rack, and wind faring. I also had a bug / wind screen bike cover. On a trip of 500 miles we dropped to an average of 35pmg. Giant drop. 1 bike, 2 bikes, forward, backward, road or mtn, seems to be about the same 10mpg drop every time. 

While the comments on your question are good, i'll answer anyway. Short answer: Yes for your specific needs this is a fitting bike. Longer. Yes, If you have some hills, the 3 speed oxford model may help. Buying a used bike off craigslist for someone with little bike knowledge is probably not a great idea. a $50 - 100 bike in my area is generally pretty old. beat up and not worth the savings. 

I use a sling like shoulder strap and bag. I dont mind the bag, it has some padding and room for extra tools / supplies. I have tried hooking a strap to the tripod itself (at the head and the weight hook, but it felt more unsecured than just using the bag. 

Your best bet may be layers. Start with a bike short or tights (non chamois if thats your style), then layer on a wind / water resistent outdoor pant. Something you would find at high end outdoor retailer (REI, EMS, Etc.). Lots of options from northface, sierra, columbia, etc. They will have plenty to offer in terms of durability and slenderness in the legs. When its really cold a fleece tight, but as it warms up just a lycra tight, then maybe just lycra shorts should be good. 

How much maintenance and what is it specifically that needs attention on 2006 - 2010 Santa Cruz Bur VPP rear linkage mountain bikes? Im looking to buy a used Blur XC, but I hear they need a lot of upkeep. Just wondering what. Is it just a lube and clean situation? or replacing bushings on a yearly basis? 

I dont think thats IN the bottom bracket. Its too sharp and hollow sounding. Like something plastic. IF you remove the chain, and examine the cables and crank arms, i suspect you will find something else. Broken plastic bushing, some sort of guard, etc. The second thing would be to remove the cranks. These are new cranks, and will be a single bolt on the non drive side. Non drive side will come off, and the drive side will slide out with the crank spline / shaft. Now you can inspect both sides of the sealed bearings. 

Ride with what you need. My commute is about 3 miles. I never carry any tools, and i only bring rain gear if rain is in the forecast. Good fenders are key, and i agree a basket or rack is nice. Lugging it all in a backpack gets old. Especially a laptop, lunch, water, coffee and bike lock. 

Having had low end aluminum, mid grade steel, and now a Specialized roubaix SL3 full carbon, can say the full carbon is the reason they dont need suspension. The Specialized Roubaix wins on the cobbles more often then not. Carbon is smooth and really takes most small bumps to a manageable level. All at 16lbs. Where any suspension fork is going to be 2 pounds and have trouble being as stiff enough to mee a racers demands. 

If your lines dont leak, you should be set. Contamination of brake fluid (bikes and cars actually) is caused by exposure to air and dirt. Sealed lines should be good for 5 years easy,if not longer. I would only replace if the lines got a crack or cut in them. Because bike brakes have a very solid seal, and no real massive reservoir, they are less prone to contamination then a car. Since cars have a large reservoir usually under a simple pop top or screw cap with a light seal, they see a bit more dirt and air in the fluid. 

Not an answer you want to hear, but Tektro parts are very sparse because they are entry level, and low budget. No one really makes parts for them other than tektro. So if its discontinued you may see if a bike shop can make something else fit, but online you will likely not find a match by visual. Avid or hayes make brakes that are more universally supported. 

If the hard sprint doenst work, Pepper spray is small, compact and quickly deployed. Some say a simple water bottle squirt to the dogs face will do it, but i have had a few persistant strays. A half spray in the general direction is more than enough. 

My personall suggestion is the classic 1990's book / Video "Mountain bike like a champion" by Ned Overend Or his Performance Mountain biking DVD Both have helped me more than i expected. Otherwise practice practice practice, and ride with people better than you anytime you can. Another alternative, but the most expensive, is go to a local pro's "skills camp". Often a few days of riding, instruction, and hands on help. I hear amazing things about these kinds of camps, but have never been to one personally. 

Probably getting close. As you experience more flats than normal or really begin to notice the ledge of that tire corner when you lean into a curve its probably time. Some people wait till the fabric is showing, but i dont like the amount of flats that i start getting. 2000 miles is a great life span for any tire, I say time for a new one. 

I have repaired non structural and surface carbon blemishes with clear nail polish. I had no issues and used the handle bars for several years with no issues. 

in my experience bolt on rear wheels with horizontal drop outs / single speeds actually perform better. 

meguires quick detail car shine is a fine product. Also you could wet clay bar to get rid of the small stuck on grime. 

Spit. Im not kidding. Saliva is a great lubricant that will dry with little residue, and depending on any sugars in your system, could be a little tacky. I have done this for years. 

Using some conduit and bungee cords, i presume you could fashion some sort of hooks. I envision a simple 180 bend on the main bike, and a T with both ends of the T also having a 180 bend on the bike side. Sounds hokey, but i made a picture, maybe it works, maybe it get the wheels turning on a better idea. Just need to find a way to use a bungee cord or two to keep it all together. 

While this wont be as consistent as the image above, wrapping your bike with electroluminescent wire will be 10x cheaper and faster, plus last longer. Amazone sells it pretty cheap here I have used it on bikes, Halloween costumes, kid toys, etc. Its super flexible, durable and safe. 9ft runs on 2 AA batteries. Tape or zip tie it on as needed. 

You can generally find a great deal on a used single speed 29er. Everyone likes to try it, few stick with it. Or with your busget, they find they love it, and upgrade selling their "starter" SS 29er. Try your local Craigslist.org, MTBR.com and ebay.com for deals on used. 

Lightly feathering the brakes. Hard braking often locks up a tire causing a skid or to break free from the ground. This is uncontrolled and damages both tires and trails. So to modulate the brakes, slowly squeeze the brake lever, and pausing mid way once the brakes are working, you probably have more you could squeeze, just dont need to. Different brake set ups will offer differing levels of available modulation. 

Look to a 3 speed hybrid or a flat bar road bike. Craigslist and ebay may really save you some money. Plenty of deals out there for $500. You may want a touring style / path bike because they will have a bigger volume tire. A true road bike has a 25mm wide tire, and touring / path bike will have a 32 or 35mm wide tire. A little better for the bumps and holes. You can try new with places like bikesDirect.com hybrids or Bike Nashbars Hybrids pages. both have deals in the range you are looking for. 

I have an older fox Talas RLC fork. It rebounds under no weight fine, but even just sitting and pedaling it compresses fully. If i pull up it will rebound, or get off it will rebound. But it seems to slowly sink when im on the bike. Lock out still works, and the PSI is at 90-100, and I weigh 185. So that seems to be within normal range. 

Sounds like your headset is loose. Have you properly rebuilt the stack order of the bearings, cups, shims and lower race? Also make sure your star nut / top cap is pretty snug with the stem bolts loose, so you can fully seat the headset stack. Then tighten the stem bolts on the steerer tube. 

I use a citrus degreaser and its great. I clean my entire bike with it, but it gets the sweat and oils off the tape so the dirt stops sticking. 

Because of your interest, age and desire to ride a trike, I would recommend a 3 speed. Trikes are very heavy and if you are new to biking you may need an easier gear than what a single speed will offer stock on most trikes. 

Short answer. Hub integrity can not really be judged by noise alone, but by feel. If you feel it slipping under load the hub could be damaged beyond repair. The quiet smooth feel, but working normally is just a good, sealed hub that the manufacturer built in a way that has smaller or less splines. The full monty. A free wheel hub consists of a few key elements. The splined hub body, springs and pawls. The spline is a series of ramped teeth. Slipping one direction, gripping the other. This allows the coasting. Fancy hubs may have more splines than cheaper ones. The pawls are little teeth that grip the spline, and are spring loaded to keep them engaged when the cassette body is spinning faster than the hub. So as a hub wears, its usually the splines or the pawls loosing their crisp shape, or the springs in the pawls no longer being strong enough to keep the pawl engaged.
