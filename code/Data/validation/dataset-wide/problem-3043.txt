Later on, gladiators were not only slaves, but ex-soldiers and free men as well. An ex-soldier would be intimately familiar with the (Roman) arms and armor he had worn during his service, but the gladiators rarely appeared as Roman troops, in the current garb of the day, so even the soldiers, those with the most training already, might need other training on how to properly use weapons and armor used by the barbarians, or perhaps Roman legions of by-gone eras. (The whole gladiatorial period lasted several centuries, and times change.) 

According to an American Anthropologist article written by A. L. Kroeger, one example of Stimulus Diffusion would be Chinese Porcelain. In the Sixteenth Century, Chinese Porcelain started coming into Europe. Porcelain had previously been unknown. Over the course of the next two centuries, as more and more people discovered the usefulness of porcelain, the demand was fairly universal throughout Europe. Unfortunately, due to demand and the high cost of importation from China, it was extremely expensive. European craftsman had to both find the materials and duplicate the processes. The kaolin deposits were found in Germany and the craftsmen invented and perfected the manufacturing processes, enabling relatively inexpensive European porcelain to be made. Bottom Line Chinese Porcelain was imported into Europe. -> European housewives wanted it. Chinese porcelain was prohibitively expensive. European craftsmen found the materials and invented new processes to manufacture equivalent porcelain. The materials used were not exactly the same and the manufacturing processes were completely new inventions. The output was of comparable quality. -> European Porcelain was now made available. 

Before germ theory, there were similar concepts of infectious disease- bad humors, bad air, etc. Miasma theory held that decaying organic matter transmitted infectious fumes to other organic matter. Girolamo Fracastoro went further and developed a proto-germ theory in the 1500s. So people got the idea. 

The same methodology could be applied to predict the collapse of the Shah's government, the 1970s stagflation in the US, and the fate of oil producers in general. Hubbert published his method in 1956. 

M. King Hubbert predicted that Soviet oil production would decline as it did, thus implying an economic collapse. 

$URL$ Aqueducts did, in some cases, freeze over. Aqueducts were built underground in the northern provinces to even out the temperatures over the day, and this helped a bit. $URL$ $URL$ Flow rates are 5 to 70 L/s on modern models of Roman dropshafts. However, you can't prevent water from freezing over long distances just by increasing the flow rate. Presumably there was no running water if it became too cold. 

If you meet the enemy as they begin to cross, they may halt their crossing, preventing the attack. They may fire at you from the far shore. If you let only as much of the enemy force as you can handily defeat, cross the river, you can easily defeat them while the reinforcements attempt to cross to their comrades. This is a form of "divide and conquer." 

According to FM23-95 Basic Field Manual, 75mm Tank Gun M2 (Mounted in Medium Tank M3), the amount of traverse to the left and the right, are actually 14° 0'. Turns of hand wheel to traverse through maximum travel (28°) is 25½. One turn of the hand wheel was 1° 6'.

Here is a diagram of a typical battleship, an Iowa class. As you can see, there's only armor over critical areas like the engine and armament. A shell hit anywhere else isn't going to need to penetrate much steel to deal damage. The cruiser San Francisco actually was disabled by HE, and barely escaped before AP shells could be loaded.

In Dante's Inferno, the eigth circle of hell is for insincerity, which includes politicians. The second pit in particular includes the prostitute Thais from classical mythology, who falsely aggrandized her lover. But these aren't real people. I think that the lack of historical figures displaying sycophantic tendencies shows either the ineffectiveness of this tactic, or conversely, its extreme prevalence and lack of notability. 

While there are many articles discussing the Australian Aborigines' de facto legalized slavery, or essentially free labor, the fact seems to be that they were never de jure slaves, as Africans were. Why didn't England press the Australian indigenous Aborigine population into actual slavery? 

That was it. At all times, out of the harbor, they operated in war time conditions, which meant submersed most/all of the daylight hours, and at night, 5 men above decks. 

In 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean blue. He sailed farther than anyone else had ever done, on three tiny ill-equipped ships. After days of sailing he finally reached his intended destination and discovered the Westward sea route to the East Indies. Unfortunately he didn't actually reach his goal. Fortunately for me, he discovered the new world. Were there other explorers heading out into the unknown and uncharted waters Westward from Spain, England, or Portugal that failed? In other words, everyone remembers the winner, and second place is another word for loser. Who were some also-rans? 

People had all kinds of jobs. One of the interesting thing about engineering before the digital age is that there were whole divisions of workers making graphs and visualizations, and doing calculations. What we would today use a spreadsheet software for, used to be done by hand by dedicated employees. Here is a database of everyone on the project. The project required creation of an entire town, with doctors, entertainment, personal services, etc. There were also foreign spies. 

"Country" is derived from the Latin term for "land across the river". Thus, in history, nobody really talks of "countries" if they can avoid it. But we can talk about "states". $URL$ The claim that Andorra became independent in 805 could easily be a myth created to justify sovereignty. The Andorran government claims to have the charter of independence locked in a safe. We have no way of knowing what happened. If the earlier date is wrong, we know it became independent in 1278. 

When White men came to mainland North America, there were an indigenous population already here. I will refer to that population as North American Indians. Africans were brought to the Americas (eventually) as slaves. Talk to an average White man in the South, point at a group of Black men (African Americans, Negros) and he could be expected to think "slaves". Why didn't America (or the English before the American Revolution) think of (or write laws to the effect that) the indigenous North American Indian population as slaves? NOTE: I'm not asking why didn't they enslave American Indians, just why didn't they view them as (think of them as) slaves. 

This question seems to be attracting poor quality answers. Some tangential discovery by some scientist is held up as being critical to the bomb. This shows a total lack of understanding. Here is some actual background: $URL$ The atomic bomb was an extrapolation of critical pile experiments conducted at various locations in the 1930s. These had little to do with Jews, Szilard, or anything of the sort. The actual development of the bomb again had little to do with Jews. Atomic bombs are quite simple devices, especially the ones used over Japan. They are little more than a ring of explosives or gun that compresses uranium into a small space to attain criticality. It's absurd to claim that any one group of people was essential in figuring them out. There was no way that Germany could ever come anywhere close to developing the bomb because it requires vast amounts of energy to process the uranium. The US created the city of Oak Ridge to get this done, and mined uranium from Canada. Germany had nowhere near that kind of hydro and uranium resource, and the Allies easily destroyed their attempts to build heavy water plants in Norway. In short the accepted answer is completely ahistorical and has no relation to physical reality. No, Jews had no particular essential role in creating the bomb. 

The first ship to successfully circumnavigate the world was the Nao Victoria. It was originally part of Magellan's fleet. All of the other ships (the Trinidad, the San Antonio, Concepción and the Santiago), Ferdinand Magellan himself, and most of the sailors of the Victoria had already either been killed, or turned back before this. When the Victoria finally returned to port, under the command of Captain Juan Sebastian de Elcano, they discovered, even though their logs were kept meticulously, that they found they were a day behind everyone else. This, eventually, led to the establishment of the International Date Line.

Climate geography explains most economic development. This is the reason why certain regions, such as Africa, are significantly poorer than temperate, dry, UV-protected regions such as Europe. There is the problem of causality. But it clearly runs from climate to development in most cases. There is no third variable causing both winter temperature and GDP, for example, and there is no plausible way that GDP would affect winter temperature (besides global warming, but that points in the wrong direction). There may be various geological and racial reasons why this is the case, but that's a separate question. 

Bombing was really the only way the Western Allies could attack Germany until mid 1944, so that is what they did. Even in 1945, the Allied controlled ports were operating at max capacity and it was much easier to invest in bombing than building up port capacity to move more troops into Europe. Also, by then the war was practically over, the occupation zones were agreed on, and the Allies preferred air power over land warfare given political pressure for lower casualties. The USSR and Germany had a land border with good supply lines and as a result they had no need for relatively ineffective tactics like strategic bombing. 

Much as the entertainment wrestlers of today, wounds and injuries were common. Just because the gladiator you face today is a colleague, perhaps even friend, doesn't mean that gladius he (or she) is swinging won't slice open your skin if you stumble the wrong way. So the gladiators were provided the best of medical care, at least as was known then. Plus, while pure slaves might have to live on scraps and be lucky to count one good meal a day, the physical exertions of gladiators meant they had to be fed not only with more regularity, but better quality as well. 

Well, drugs and drug abuse has been around since the beginning of man, of that I am positive. In the Victorian era, for instance, addiction to laudanum was a major thing. Mary Todd Lincoln (the First Lady) was said to have been so addicted. As far as the American 50's, according to a blog I read the wide-spread drug abuse of the 60's was the direct result of the behind-the-scenes drug use of the 50's. The Beat Generation (aka Beatnicks) were the abusers of the 50s. WWII caused a boom in the development of pain killers. The drugs of choice of the 50s appear to have been Marijuana, Heroin and LSD. Their main usage demographics, however, were mostly inner-city and the so-called Jazz-scene. The blog is pretty enlightening and finished with several citations. Well worth a read.
