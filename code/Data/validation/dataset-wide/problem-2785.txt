Showing a position is true or probably true is impossible. The idea that it is possible and desirable to prove ideas true or probably true (justificationism) is wrong. In reality, you can't prove any position or show it is probable. Any argument requires premises and rules of inference and it doesn't prove (or make probable) those premises or rules of inference. If you're going to say they're self evident then you are acting in a dogmatic manner that will prevent you from spotting some mistakes. If you don't say they are self evident then you would have to prove those premises and rules of inference by another argument that would bring up a similar problem with respect to its premises and rules of inference. In reality all knowledge is created by conjecture and criticism. You notice a problem with your current ideas, propose solutions, criticise the solutions until only one is left and then find a new problem. If you have an explanation that claims that some particular object is in a particular room, and you have an idea about how to test that claim, then you can go ahead and test it. If you test the claim and it fails the test, then either the claim was false or there was something wrong with the test. You explanation of how the test works will have implications for issues other than the outcome of that test and so can be tested by testing those independent implications.

The existence or non-existence of God is not a scientific issue since it can't be settled by experiment. However, the explanation for why this is the case is a criticism of theism, not atheism. Agnosticism is also a bad position for reasons I will explain below. Having said all this, I am not a militant atheist. I don't think that eradicating religion by law would be a good idea. I also think it is possible religious people have some ideas that are morally better than the corresponding ideas held by secular people. We should aim to retain the best parts of any tradition by reforming it to keep its best parts and get rid of the chaff unless there is some reason this can't be done. For example, I doubt that Nazism could be reformed because it was just an excuse for mass murder and conquest, it had to be destroyed. Christians aren't Nazis. The standard atheist line is that since you can't prove God exists (or that he probably exists) he doesn't exist. This is wrong because you can't prove any position (or show it is probable) and so this argument doesn't pick out theism as being any different from any other position. Any argument requires premises and rules of inference and it doesn't prove (or make probable) those premises or rules of inference. If you're going to say they're self evident then you are using the same argument as a theist who claims it is obvious that God exists. If you don't say they are self evident then you would have to prove those premises and rules of inference by another argument that would bring up a similar problem with respect to its premises and rules of inference. Another approach that is sometimes used is that reason has to do with how the human mind works, but since how your mind works doesn't necessarily have anything to do with truth, that doesn't get us anywhere. Knowledge is not justified true belief: justification is impossible. In reality all knowledge is created by conjecture and criticism. You notice a problem with your current ideas, propose solutions, criticise the solutions until only one is left and then find a new problem. Experiments are useful only as criticism. Ideas can't be derived from experiment any more than from any other set of premises. Rather, the idea is that you work out how the consequences of one theory differ from those of another. Then you conjecture ideas about experimental setups that would enable you to see the relevant consequences and criticise them. Once you have a setup that works about as well as you can make it work you use it to do the test. If the results are compatible with one theory and not the others then you may have successfully refuted some false ideas. Sometimes a purported successful experimental test will be successfully criticised because a test is a conjecture about something that happened and that conjecture may be wrong, so experiments don't prove anything. Theism can't be experimentally tested. If God existed he could have made the world any way he liked, so no feature of how the world actually works can rule out his existence, even in principle. For example, he could have made the world 6000 years ago with fossils and stars and photons travelling through space in just the way we see them. Nor can God explain anything about moral philosophy. Perhaps God had some reason for making the world the way it is, in which case we can just say the world is that way because reason X. For example, if he made eyes so that we can move around without bumping into stuff any mechanism that would respect the priority of not bumping into stuff will do, God is not necessary. For example, if not bumping into stuff helps spread genes for not bumping and genes for bumping don't spread, then evolution can explain non-bumping. If God make the world the way it is on a whim, then we might just as well say "shit happens". One reason why theism can't be tested is that it doesn't solve any problem. It is also incompatible with good explanations, it can't be the case that God made the world 6000 years ago and that evolution is the only way to explain adaptive complexity. So theism is untenable. Now, the standard agnostic line is that we can't be prove whether God exists or not so we shouldn't say he doesn't. The problem with this is that you can't prove anything so this is an irrelevant objection to any particular position, including atheism. Moreover, it is better to take the strongest possible form of any position. The reason is that the strongest form has more implications. This makes it more useful if it is true, since you can rule out more bad ideas with it. And if the position is false, then it is easier to find out that it is false since there are more implications that can potentially be refuted.

No. Your view, whatever it is, agrees with your intuitive ideas about ethics, which I'd guess are a muddle of ideas you've picked up more or less by accident because they happened to be around when you were doing a philosophy course or something. 

Gettier problems are that some ideas that allegedly satisfy the formula of being justified true belief are not knowledge. One example is suppose that Peter believes that he has ten coins in his pocket, that he believes he has ten coins in his pocket and that he is going to be given a promotion to chief toilet cleaner and has heard about from a reliable source. The Gettier claims Peter has a justified true belief that the man being promoted to chief toilet cleaner has ten coins in his pocket. The Gettier problem highlights a real problem in an indirect way hidden by a lot of bad ideas. The problem is this. There are many facts that nobody gives a hoot about and don't seem particularly significant, like the colour of my computer mouse. Knowing the colour of my mouse won't shed any light on any issue. So people don't think the information about the colour of my mouse is knowledge, and they are right. Your response is that this is just a problem of people having a false intuition, but you are wrong. This is an instance of a fatal problem with the JTB theory. A theory is deemed to be justified if it has gone through some process called justification that make it true or probably true. The model for how JTB knowledge is created goes something like this. You somehow (1) come to believe a theory and it is somehow (2) justified and (3) it is true. JTB theories typically either have nothing to say about step (1), or they say something that is false. For example, inductivism (the belief in induction) claims that you somehow get a theory from experimental results. In reality, there is an infinity of ideas compatible with any experimental result, so you can't get a theory from experimental results. So then where do theories come from? Where could they come from? They can't come from the truth since you don't know what's true and they're not totally random. What happens is that you notice a problem with existing knowledge, something existing knowledge doesn't explain, and then you produce variants of that knowledge to try to solve the problem. You look for criticisms of the variants, including looking for cases in which they are incompatible with experimental results. You keep coming up with variants and criticising them until only one is left and the last variant standing solves the problem. You then look for problems with your new theory. The growth of knowledge starts with problems. It starts with current, flawed knowledge. The knowledge it invents solves those problems. Knowledge is always a solution to a problem. The ten coins in the pocket example is just an example of somebody happening to be aware of some useless fact. The JTB theory doesn't explain why this is not knowledge. It also fails to solve a lot of other problems. JTB is false. For more on why JTB is piffle and what should replace it, see "Realism and the Aim of Science" by Karl Popper and "The Beginning of Infinity" by David Deutsch. 

If you read the quote in context, it becomes clearer why Newton took the position that absolute space exists. I will explain briefly here but for more detail see "The Discovery of Dynamics" by Julian Barbour. The problem has to do precisely with the law that objects continue to move in a straight line with constant velocity (inertial motion) unless a force acts on them. The question that arises is with respect to what frame will the object move inertially? If you drive down the road and turn your car, then another car moving in a straight line appears to you not to be moving in a straight line. So why should we say that you are accelerating and not the other car? Descartes proposed a solution to this problem: objects do not experience a force unless they are acted on by adjacent objects but Newton pointed out that this is false with the bucket experiment. Suppose that you take a bucket full of water and tie a rope to the handle of the bucket. Then you twist the rope up a lot and release the bucket. The bucket spins and at this stage of the experiment the surface of the water is flat although the bucket is moving. Later, when the bucket has stopped moving the water will be spinning. So in both cases the motion of the water is not a straight line with respect to the surrounding matter. Newton concluded that what determines whether an object is moving inertially is its motion with respect to absolute space. He was wrong about that but his argument was not stupid. The issue was not about what he could see but with what explanations actually accounted for what he could see. The problem was not properly solved until Einstein came up with the general theory of relativity, which explained that acceleration is equivalent to not moving in free fall: it is caused by interactions with the gravitational field.
