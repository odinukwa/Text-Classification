I can think of other examples. The Hungarians are not Huns. The Bulgarians are not Bulgars. The Dutch are not Deutsch/Germans. The Hungarians and Dutch do not use these names when speaking their own languages, but will use them if they are speaking a foreign language like English. 

This is not mentioned in the linked Wikipedia article, but in Middle Persian texts from the first half of the first millennium AD the king is addressed as ašmā bayān, literally “you (plural) gods”. This rather puts paid to the claim that the honorific use of the 2nd person plural pronoun originated in Latin. 

It doesn't have a special name. It is the correct way to write Arabic. But if you are looking for a name, "stacking" is as good as any. 

Arabic (classical) has a lot of different ways of expressing negatives. laysa refers (usually) to the present time, lam to past time, lan to future time, lā and mā can refer to any time depending on the tense of the following verb. laysa is a conjugated verb, the others are immutable particles. 

“Doodenbeer” is North German dialect (Plattdeutsch). Literally it does indeed mean “death beer”. It is a drink taken after a funeral, then, in a broader sense, a funeral ceremony or wake itself. See the entries “Beer” and “Doodenbeer” here: $URL$ 

In Persian the indefinite article /i/ can be attached to a noun, or to a noun+adjective phrase. For example: pesar-i “a boy” pesar-e bozorg-i “a big boy”. Though of course in written Persian this article is written to the left of the head word. Just as a comment on the inadequacy of this "left / right" terminology. 

I am reminded of the famous story about how the young Max Planck was told by his professor to steer well clear of a career in physics, as there was nothing new to be discovered in that field. In historical linguistics, or specifically Indo-European studies, since the 1990s a whole new corpus of texts in a hitherto virtually unknown language were discovered, namely Bactrian. These have revolutionised our knowledge of ancient Iranian and Indo-European languages. Just to add: none of this has filtered down to the holy of holies of internet wisdom (“Wikipedia”). 

Indian English is English as spoken by people whose first language is an Indian language (mostly Indo-Aryan or Dravidian). The English of India is strongly influenced by Indo-Aryan phonology, morphology and syntax. In this particular case I think we have to see a calque on the Indo-Aryan use of the infinitive as a semi-polite (or politeness-neutral) imperative; e.g. as in Hindi bacnā “look out!”, which is formally an infinitive (“to look, to be looking”), but is used here as a command form. May I add that “to be + VERB +-ing” is a perfectly “normal” (to use your word) present continuous infinitive in English (“It is time to be looking for a new job.”) What is not normal in standard English is its use as a command form. See R.S. McGregor, Outline of Hindi Grammar, 2nd edition, p. 41. 

Casus rectus and Casus obliquus are calques on πτῶσις ὀρθή (“upright fall”) and πτῶσις πλαγία (“sideways fall”) respectively. It has been suggested that these were originally technical terms in a game of dice. 

You write: “Japanese is the only language I know about that doesn't have a /u/ sound - it has /ɯ/ instead.” Although you are using slashes, I think you are really talking about phonetics (“a /u/ sound”) and not about phonology. Phonology is an abstraction. There is no overwhelming reason why you should not analyse the Japanese [ɯ] as phonological /u/, nor is there any good reason not to analyse English [æ] as phonological /a/. These are just abstract symbols, like the symbols used in algebra. It would be better to ask whether there are any languages that have fewer than three vowel phonemes. Your question, as it stands, in unanswerable. 

This phenomenon is not unique to Serbo-Croatian. It can be observed also in Arabic, where you have (for example): singular: šahr = one month dual: šahrān = two months plural of paucity: ʼašhur = 3 to 10 months plural of multitude: šuhūr = more than 10 months The dual suffix –ān is proto-Semitic. It does not derive from the word “two”, but the word “two” is morphologically dual (e.g. Arabic iϑn-ān). The two plural forms are not formed by adding any word to the singular but follow the rules for nominal derivation from a three-consonant root (in this case š-h-r). As always in linguistics, none of this has any logical “reason”. Language has its own logic. 

The wikipedia article is (as often) badly formulated. "In the Germanic languages" is wrong. "In (some) Germanic languages" would be all right. 

The replacement of historic /ɒn/ by /un/ is a well-known feature of Tehran dialect (“Tehruni”), which has become the colloquial koine in the whole of Iran. The phenomenon that you are observing is what in linguistics is called “diglossia”, where one form of the language is used in formal writing and speech, but another form is used in ordinary conversation. There is a very pronounced diglossia in Arabic, besides other languages. 

In classical Arabic the present tense takes a prefix and a suffix, while the past tense takes only a suffix: ya-fʻal-ūna “they do” faʻal-ū “they did” Similarly in Persian: mī-rav-and “they go” raft-and “they went”. 

The classic explanation is that *ṛš becomes ur in Old Indian. The ending of the gen. sing. of Indo-Iranian -r stems is sometimes *-as and sometimes *-s. pitur is like hotur (Avestan zaotarš, with full-grade stem). 

The majority of languages in the world do not have grammatical gender and do not distinguish between masculine and feminine forms of the pronoun. Those that do distinguish belong to the Indo-European or Afro-Asiatic families, plus a very small number of other single languages. For this reason it is futile to draw up a long list of languages that do NOT have gendered pronouns (Turkish, Finnish…..). It would be more useful to ask which non-Indo-European and non-Afro-Asiatic languages DO have gendered pronouns. 

Nobody knows what PIE sounded like. The symbols used to represent PIE phonemes are essentially "algebraic" symbols. When we propose a PIE phoneme *bh, this is merely shorthand for "the PIE phoneme which is reflected by Skt /bh/, Greek /ph/, Latin /f/ etc." The conventional transcription has no phonetic content. 

In German, umlaut is admittedly no longer productive, but it is still very much in evidence in words like Mann > Männer, Kuh > Kühe, and many more. 

I am not sure about the oldest word, but the OED has early references for: pintle (Old English) pillicok from about 1328 onwards prick from about 1558 onwards pillo(c)k from 1568 onwards cock from 1618 onwards Also this from Urquhart’s famous translation of Rabelais from 1653: “My pusher, dresser, pouting stick, my horny pipe, my pretty pillicock, linkie pinkie…” 

As you say, “Cartesian” is from the Latinised form of the family name “Descartes”. This derives from the one-time place name “Les Cartes”. So “Descartes” means “from (the place called) Les Cartes”. However, I have not found any satisfactory explanation for this toponym. It could be from the plural of carte, “playing card, map”, but this does not sound like a very plausible name for a village. Otherwise, do you know if Descartes himself (writing of course in Latin) ever referred to the co-ordinate system as a “charta”? Maybe you would get a better answer in the “History of science and mathematics" forum. 

There is no difference. It is just a matter of spelling. You can write the particle مى as a separate word, or you can join it to the following verb. 

I think I understand what you are asking. Urdu, like Persian, is written with Arabic script, with a few extra letters. The numbers are written with the Eastern form of the Arabic (originally Indian) numerals. So yes, they do use the same unicode coding. 

In principle, sound laws are universal within any given language. (I say “in principle” because every rule has its exceptions). This means that the same sound laws will affect all words regardless of whether they are nouns, verbs, prepositions or whatever. 

The Mitanni texts are in Hurrian, a non-Indo-European and non-Semitic language. As you mentioned, they contain some loanwords and proper names taken from proto-Indo-Aryan. This form of Hurrian is written in an Akkadian-based cuneiform script, so it is likely that the scribes also used Akkadian for certain types of documents. By the way, "official papers" is not really the right term for a chancery that wrote not on paper but on clay. 

Both of these roots originally had an initial w-. horos “boundary” is from older worwos, as attested by Mycenaean wo-wo, and dialect forms like ορϝος. In the case of orgē “anger” we do not happen to have any attested Greek dialect forms with w-, but IE *uerg- is supported by zero-grade forms like Sanskrit ūrj- “strength”. 

Although most linguists would agree that there is a considerable amount of vocabulary shared by Uralic and Indo-European languages, there is not really any consensus as to why this is the case. The mainstream view is probably still that developed by Björn Collinder in his copious publications, which distinguishes various strata of IE borrowings into Uralic: First: borrowings from proto-IE into proto-Uralic. Second: borrowings from proto Indo-Iranian (the ancestor of the Indo-Aryan and Iranian languages) into proto-Fenno-Ugric (that is: the ancestor of all the Uralic languages other than Samoyedic). Third: pre-modern borrowings from IE languages into individual Uralic languages, notably the borrowings from Alanic (the ancestor of Ossetic, an Iranian language) into Hungarian, or the borrowings from proto-Germanic into Finnish. Fourth: borrowings in relatively modern times, e.g. those from Swedish into Finnish. Very strangely, all of these seem to be borrowings in one direction only. The Uralic languages seem in each case to have been recipients only.
