Worst case scenario you change something behind you manager's back, and he doesn't know what's going on suddenly. Makes him look bad, makes you look bad. Draft your methods going forward and present your plan to your manager, and ask that you take charge under his supervision. This is an opportunity as a junior to take on a project you're interested in. But, your manager may also have valuable input, mentoring or advisory to complement whatever it is you draft. Granted, it doesn't guarantee you'll lead those changes. I think it goes without saying, however, that in most cases you shouldn't subvert your manager. 

If their temperament permits it, people will get offended even if you speak to them in the most professional, unbiased tone. Just get the point across: If he asks you to do something unreasonable, say "I'm busy, you will have to return it." A reasonable person might even connect the dots eventually: "Oh no! Have I been offending him this entire time by making these requests?" In this case you'd have nothing to explain; you are coworkers, not superior/subordinate. He will task you as many times as you permit him. But I think the way to avoid offending him if it's within your best interest that way is to be frank, direct, and don't allow it to boil over into frustration for yourself. This is for everything but the rest area. If you open something, or turn something on, it's your responsibility to shut it down and so forth. That's just common courtesy, and it should go unsaid. If he doesn't do it, people such as supervisors will catch on. 

US Businesses: Executives in small companies can say whatever they want to investors with caveats. Smart companies know what to say and what not to say, however, and utilize legal teams and industry professionals to doctor releases. Now, the investors know the technology pipeline, what the company is developing, it's why they invested in the company. The executive committee are making what are called forward-looking statements. I'm just going to glance this off Wikipedia because it's accurate: 

I think that courses can be useful for entries such as credits offered for continuing education. For example: 

It's my belief that dealing with difficult people lies in realizing why they're being difficult. Instead of talking with your colleagues, sit down with your lead and say "Look, we had this situation (exactly as you explained it to us). I know you've been with this company for a while and I just want to get a handle on your thought process so I can make things work more smoothly going forward." The problem with some people, especially if they're high performers, is their thought process is everywhere. They sometimes think that after a hasty explanation, you're right there with them, and sure in some cases if you aren't it upsets them. Don't let it upset you though, because I think it's okay to ask questions, and get a better understanding of the people component here, even if you obviously know what you're doing in your role. I wouldn't let egos clash. 

I submitted my resignation yesterday and it was not smooth at all. I want to discuss it a little bit and get feedback on my side. So first I submitted by E-Mail. I planned of sending an email to give a heads up and then meeting CEO and discuss details with my written letter. I feel it was bad decision and mistake on my part because they were pissed I sent an E-Mail rather than doing it in person. It was a visa sponsored job in Germany and they took my decision to quit very personally and were visibly angry, partly because they sponsored my visa. I quitted in around ~6 months because of very dis-satisfaction with working conditions and working hours. I tried to work, but I just couldn't bear working conditions there. They are not very horrible, but it's just I have worked in much better companies. And there were several things about them I didn't like. They asked what I didn't like. When I tried explaining, I felt they were not very open to feedback and they just tried to justify themselves without letting me speak. There is one problem I specifically want to talk about. Two days ago, I was assigned a new one-month long project (for 1 person)(we are software development agency). But yesterday I finally had appointment at local employment agency and I got their permission to change job. My probation period was also ending this month, so if I had not resigned yesterday, I would have got stuck here for 2 months because my notice period is 2 months after probation period vs 2 week now. They were angry why I didn't told them earlier. It was because I couldn't resign until I had permission from govt because of visa. They literally told me why I didn't told them I am looking for a new job. I want to leave on good terms. So I am thinking of completing the project over weekend and work extra after end of probation period. I don't want to do it, but I don't want them to hate me either. They literally told me my resignation so soon is leaving a very negative perception of me in their eyes. My questions are: A) Is resignation over E-Mail considered unprofessional? B) Am I professionally obliged to work on a visa sponsored job even if I am not satisfied with working conditions and I tried 6 months to make it work? C) Am I supposed to give head-ups to my employer that I am planning to quit until I am not sure if I am allowed to legally? D) What are my professional obligations towards unfinished projects at the time of resignation. They just accepted the project 2 days ago and said if I had resigned a day earlier, they wouldn't have accepted the project. Am I oblige to finish it? I have an option to work Monday-Sunday and finish it as much as possible before I leave. But there is one more problem. I only have 1 month since my day of quitting to accept a new job. If I don't by then, I have to apply for another visa, and later change to work visa. That will cause me to be unemployed for a while and without any salary. I don't suppose they will pay me if I am unemployed because of waiting for visa. So I just want to use this time instead to find a good job ASAP. 

Approach it as you would any side gig. Decide if you want to do it. And if so, decide how much time you want to devote to it. (Remember, you have a primary job and you want to start that off on your best foot. Don't starve your "real" job to feed your "side" job.) As for pay, you seem to have some leverage here. You should be able to get your prior salary easily. And it wouldn't be much of a stretch to get your prior salary plus the cost of the extra taxes you must pay as a 1099 contractor. You would have a decent argument to ask for your salary at your new job too. As far as benefits, I assume you'll be getting those through your new employer and don't need them through your 1099 gig. Make sure your new company won't have a problem with you working on the side. 

I wouldn't. I might add them to a cover letter, if the technologies are particularly relevant for the job of interest. And I'd certainly be ready to discuss what I was learning if the topic seemed relevant during an interview. But what I happen to be reading and learning at an instant isn't something I'd put on my resume/CV. 

If I understand you correctly, you are not employed by Big Corp. Nor do you have a contract indicating that you are starting work with them on a particular date. There is no resignation here. Thus, there is no requirement to give notice, and nothing unprofessional in starting to work with Small Corp today. (Although it would be a courtesy to tell Big Corp you are now off the market). If Big Corp wanted to have you obligated to them, they would either have you on the payroll or would have given you an offer to return that you subsequently accepted. When I (and I believe most companies) retain contractors, I fully expect them to be setting up their next gig before the current contract ends. If I want to keep the contractor around longer, I ask if we can extend their contract. If I don't extend them, I always expect anyone good will attempt to find another job (and usually succeed) - not sit around hoping that I will bring them back eventually. 

I'd suggest you decide to relax one or more of your "wants". It's probably not reasonable to expect your outcome to be different without changing any of your inputs. What you are currently doing isn't making you happy and it isn't making you any money. Something needs to change.
