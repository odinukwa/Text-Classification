You should do the best job that you can, because either: a) You complete this in such a professional fashion that you either get more work from within this company, or you get a great reference for your next post. or b) You do it in a slightly poor fashion and spend the next year making minor changes to very un-interesting code in an attempt to spin out your job. You'll be bored and you won't be advancing your skills in any way. You'll probably then want to look for a new job, but may be lacking the glowing recommendation as it took you over a year to get a simple CMS working... 

I think its kinda late at this point and would be perceived somewhat offensive to decline a good will gesture(a raise given on their own). If I were you I would just make certain that whenever its time for an evaluation round, I would schedule a meeting with my manager, plead my case and why I deserve a raise, then ask for a specific amount. Either I receive that or not, I ll know I ve done all I could for it and I ll consider my options if the result is something Im unhappy with. Also, keep in mind that to escalate to a bigger pay level sometimes changing jobs is needed, otherwise people will go off your initial base wage for any future purposes(raises/bonus etc). p.s. Goes without saying that anything non-trivial should be communicated face to face. 

At some point in the past I considered leaving my job for a different job at a non-competing company. The interview went well, but I decided not to take the job. My boss doesn't know I considered leaving. Now I've been promoted to a position where I may need to manage my company's interactions with the company I interviewed with. I'm concerned my boss may not take well to the information that I considered leaving. But if we interact with that company I can't guarantee he won't find out. What is the proper way of handling this situation? 

For posterity, I should note that I would never recommend doing any less than the best you are able. You'll be happier for one (as noted above), but you shouldn't dismiss the ability of the people around you to tell when a bad job is being done. People are generally always aware when someone is shirking (and it's very annoying). 

What has not been mentioned are your legal requirements under European data protection. You are most likely not permitted to release information about an individual without their specific consent. Doing so would be a breach of data protection regulations and could leave you open to whatever the consequences of this are in Germany. Regardless of Bob's chances, without him having given consent, you cannot do this. Given that you are unable to contact him, you should probably not even reply. 

I asked the customer three questions, and they only answered one, as if the others didn't exist. I need answers to all those questions. Frankly, I find it a little rude that they didn't read my email and give me a thorough answer, so I don't trust myself to not come across as rude in response. Is there a "correct" way to point this out and re-ask my questions? 

In late 2014 I interviewed at a nearby company. The interview went well, but afterward when it came time to discuss compensation, my requirements apparently made the interstitial recruiter angry. The interview was the last I communicated directly with our neighboring company. Since that interview, my workplace has altered drastically for the better. I have been promoted, and as part of my new job I wanted to reach out to this neighboring company. My boss knows about my interview, so I have no fear of getting in trouble. The neighboring company does not (to my knowledge) compete with us in any space, but we have overlapping competencies, and could imaginably work together on some projects. Six months ago I contacted their sales department asking if they would like to make some custom components for us. Their sales engineer said he was on the road, but would call me back the next day. I never heard back, and two further calls were left unreturned. Two months ago I emailed their director of engineering, again without response. I connected with him on LinkedIn, and he accepted my connection. I sent a similar message through LinkedIn, thinking the email kraken might have eaten my original email. No response. I emailed a different engineer at the company. No response. This strikes me as very unusual behavior. Either this company doesn't want to talk to me personally, or they don't want to talk to my company. The first seems unprofessional. The second seems concerning, as if they plan to enter competition with us. Am I overthinking this situation? Does this seem to anyone else like an unusual sequence of events? Should I be concerned? Are there any further actions I should take? 

I've been doing this job for around 15 years and what I still wouldn't regard myself as 'a very experienced programmer', partly because they keep changing what we work with! Without wanting to sound trite, I've worked with a lot of junior programmers who thought that they knew everything (they didn't *) and it can take a bit of a step in mindset to realise that there is always more to learn, and more importantly, you may also need to learn to do things in the way that your employer desires, rather than just what you think is best. 

Its perfectly understandable to be in an economic position that every pound matters. In which case you should clarify up-front with the company's HR their policy on expenses made on the basis of the interview process(since they knew you were not local). Its a whole different thing however to ask for compensation after the process concluded and after those expenses were already made. 

For the time being, I would propose you stay composed and attend the meeting without questions beforehand, this way you don't spread unnecessary tension or lose face by asking something that is very far from the truth. You should be mentally prepared for all possible outcomes and be prepared ahead of the meeting(paper trail checked etc) to defend yourself and your work if need be. The fact your sympathizing boss will be the one attending is positive. p.s. If you really can't contain yourself, you can politely and indirectly ask for the exact purpose/thematology of this meeting to the HR rep since, after all, they welcomed questions. This way you can clear it up or at least be hinted about the direction this may go. 

I have had this issue at a previous (very large employer) with a single mandated security policy across all users. They then bought us (a development house) and couldn't figure out how to let us work (requiring local admin access) on their corporate network. What we wound up with was two computers each (not even a VM). One computer (with the nice blue sticker on it) connected to the corporate network and let us do fun stuff like email and access holiday requests and the other one (with the nice red sticker on it) connected to our own lan, that we managed ourselves. I don't recommend this as an option (as it's a real nuisance), but it is one option if you really can't get access granted on the corporate network. Also handy for creating your own gaming server... 

My employer insists that everyone's Linkedin profile list their business email address, not their personal email address. Is this typical, standard, or generally accepted practice? 

Inflation as a measurement is a kind of national economic puree. Local cost of living is a much more relevant number to employees lives. Is there a proper way for an employer to quantify how cost of living changes in an area year to year, for the purposes of indexing raises? Some sort of standard table or publication? 

Its all about keeping matters civilized and polite so that you can co-exist and all get the best they can(you get your 2% almost all the time, they get their 98% uninterrupted). 

Yes, it is. You give up your parking rights for the vast majority of time even though you technically have 1/3rd "ownership" of the slot as well. As such they benefit greatly and having priority over them for the very few times per year you need to use it should be the norm. How to get there without alienating anyone:
