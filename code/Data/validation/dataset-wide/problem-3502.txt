Page 4 of this document has the balance sheet as of November 2015: $URL$ Their assets are 4489 liabilities are 4431. Thus Equity is 58, L/E = 76 (approx). It would not matter even if Fed had infinite leverage ratio. However, as far as I know congress has agreed to keep Fed solvent (so the ratio can't go negative). Although, the institution is not even solvent, as some of it's assets are marked mark to model, thus having much lower fair value than presented in the balance sheet. The balance sheet reflects created money (growth in base money) and not debt. Created money generates inflation, but significant amount of bank credit was destroyed which also constituted money people transacted with. Thus the newly created Fed money has just replaced the bank credit and there has been no significant inflation, as the M2 money supply has only raised slightly. Some of the currency has also been exported overseas as USA continues to have a balance of payment / trade deficits. Based on the quote, it seems the author has confused two issues. If you want to investigate the debt and liabilities of the government, you need to look at the government debt and it's other liabilities (not merely the Fed). He is correct that the debt is at a quite high historical level (only during world war 2 was it higher), while other liabilities (such as social security and medicare liabilities) I believe are at an unprecedented historical level. 

The firm tries to maximize profits $\Pi$ \begin{align} \max_{K,L}\{\Pi(K,L) = F(K,L) - RK - wL\} \end{align} where $F$ is the linear homogeneous production function, $R$ the rental rate of capital $K$ and $w$ the rental rate (wage) of labor $L$. FOCs are given by \begin{align} \Pi_K &= 0 \Leftrightarrow R = F_k\\ \Pi_L &= 0 \Leftrightarrow w = F_L. \end{align} Footnote 1 of page 33 in Acemoglu (2009) tells us that the FOCs can also derived by cost minimization. With (2.6) and (2.7) being $w=F_L$ and $R=F_K$ respectively. The firm tries to minize costs \begin{align} &\min_{K,L}\{RK + wL\}\\ \text{s.t.}~~& F(k,L) = Y \end{align} where $Y$ is some output level. Set up Lagrangian \begin{align} \mathcal{L} = RK + wL + \lambda(F(K,L) - Y) \end{align} FOCs are given by \begin{align} \mathcal{L}_K = 0& \Leftrightarrow R + \lambda F_K = 0\\ \mathcal{L}_L = 0& \Leftrightarrow w + \lambda F_L = 0\\ \mathcal{L}_\lambda = 0& \Leftrightarrow F(K,L) - Y = 0 \end{align} 

This is an important result in financial economics (asset pricing) but not trivial to explain intuitively. I do my best to give you the big picture and get you started on your research. R is the return on an asset or portfolio. Any asset or portfolio. m is the stochastic discount factor or pricing kernel. The expectation here is over possible states of the world given information at time t (m and R are as of t+1). These are physical, not risk-neutral, probabilities. In fact, a (positive) stochastic discount factor is what is used to translate physical to risk-neutral probabilities. In a discrete case, the risk-neutral probability is the risk free rate times the physical probability times the value of the stochastic discount factor in that state. The stochastic discount factor takes on a different value for each possible state of the world (that's the sense in which it is stochastic). But it doesn't change for each different asset. If it exists, a stochastic discount factor can be applied to every asset in the economy and price them all correctly. Facts about the SDF: 

The problem is not that the global economy is too chaotic. It is that people have different interests. And that is no wonder because for many countries the utility of using carbon most likely exceeds the utility of fighting climate change. And in fact, a case could be made that for some countries the atmospheric carbon and a warmer environment may be beneficial. 

No, because people could still find value in the notes. For example, let's say the nation had the most transparent and hard-lined central bank in existence. Then, people of other countries might find the notes worthy. Of course, there is some intrinsic value to the paper notes as well. But it would have to be assumed that such value is zero, as producing something would raise the GDP. In practice, the whole case is absurd, but the answer would almost certainly be no, no one would exchange the notes for anything. As for the mechanics of the question in the comment section, let's consider the case through the equation: $Y = C+I+G+NX$ And also the central bank's profit/balance sheet: $Assets-Liabilities=Equity$ $\Delta equity = profit$ If the central bank bought some valuables to back it's money supply (gold for example), the investment would raise and NX term would decline, cancelling out and also creating a trade deficit. All of the money would flow outside the country, so no citizen could use the currency to buy anything. If the central bank itself tried to fund the increase in consumption (or give the money to it's citizens to do so), the trade deficit and consumption would increase. However, the assets of the central bank would not increase (since consumption items depreciate). In the process the central bank would become insolvent as it would suffer a loss. Then, people would not be expected to use the service to an even higher degree. Although, the central bank could try to leverage it's balance sheet, buying investment products from foreign nations to cover for this. In the case that there was an income stream, such as donations or foreign investments, the government could easily have a solvent central bank and thus I don't see why the money would not have value. (of course, 0 GDP would require that the central bank is operated for free). The question becomes a lot different if we assume fiat currency, but I won't go into that. In any case, this is a major hypothetical with unrealistic assumptions. 

Consider some time series data $X=\{x_t:t\in[0,\infty)\}$. Define a steady state by \begin{align} x\in X:x_{t+1} - x_t = 0 \end{align} and the log deviation from steady state with \begin{align} \hat x_t:=\ln x_t - \ln_x. \end{align} Now we can express $x_t$ as \begin{align} x_t=x\exp(\hat x_t). \end{align} Consider the the following equation \begin{align} a_t = b_t c_t^\alpha + D\mathbb{E}_t\left[\left(\frac{e_{t+1}}{e_t}\right)\left(\frac{f_t}{g_t}\right)^\beta a_{t+1}\right] \end{align} where $D$ is some constant, which is ought to be log linearized for every time dependent variable around steady state. First Attempt Express every variable by its new definition,i.e. \begin{align} a\exp(\hat a_t) = b c^\alpha \exp(\hat b_t + \alpha\hat c_t)+ D\left(\frac{f}{g}\right)^\beta a\mathbb{E}_t\left[\exp(\hat e_{t+1} - \hat e_t + \beta(\hat f_t - \hat g_t) + \hat a_{t+1})\right] \end{align} which should simplify to \begin{align} \exp(\hat a_t) = \exp(\hat b_t + \alpha\hat c_t)+\mathbb{E}_t\left[\exp(\hat e_{t+1} - \hat e_t + \beta(\hat f_t - \hat g_t) + \hat a_{t+1})\right] \end{align} 

Let $i=1,2$ denote the players, $x$ the state and $u_i$ the control of player $i$. The state equation reads $\dot x = f(x,u_1,u_2)$ and the objective function is given by $F_i(x,u_1,u_2)$. Now I'd like to solve the following optimal control problem of joint maximization (cooperative solution) \begin{align} V(x(0)) := \max_{u_1,u_2}\int^\infty_0{(e^{-r_1t}F_1(x,u_1,u_2) + e^{-r_2t}F_2(x,u_1,u_2))dt} \end{align} where $r_i > 0$ is the time preference rate. I was wondering how to apply the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman in this case. Is something like the following possible? \begin{align} \frac{r_1+r_2}{2}V(x) = \max_{u_1,u_2}\{F_1(x,u_1,u_2) + F_2(x,u_1,u_2) + V'(x)f(x,u_1,u_2)\} \end{align} 

The program would increase the supply of labor to those specific sectors. As a result more foreign people would get into the sectors bidding the price down (lowering the wage). In addition, some Americans would not be able to get hired, that otherwise would have. In addition, companies would become more profitable so more companies would be started and the reduced labor costs would be visible in other sectors, increasing labor demand elsewhere. In the very long run free movement of labor is at least in theory more efficient than restricted movement, as people will more efficiently be able to navigate to the most efficient job locations available. 

The purpose of a firm is to generate income for it's share holder. Two sources of profit are appreciation and dividends. Besides that the price fluctuations can mean that the firm is doing something right/wrong and stock holders are reacting accordingly... So the price reflects on the expectations of the future profitability of a firm. 

If the maximum is less than the scrap value, then scrap it. If your profit function is continuous, then you can maximize it by differentiating with respect to the quantity produced of the two inputs, setting the first order conditions to 0, and solving. Just be sure to check that you have found the maximums and not the minimums. If it is not continuous you will need to use a different method to find the maximums. How to write the profit function? $$ \pi= TR(q_1,q_2) -TC(q_1,q_2) $$ $TR$ is usually easy. It's $$ TR(q_1,q_2) = P_1(q_1,q_2)\cdot q_1 + P_2(q_1,q_2)\cdot q_2 $$ Insert your price functions (which will be constants if you are a price-taker) and your cost function so that $\pi$ is a function only of $q_1$ and $q_2$. Then find its max. The $q_1$ and $q_2$ that maximize $\pi$ are what you want. This type of problem seems hard if you get caught up letting your right brain trying to figure out how to solve it heuristically. Don't do that. Write out the profit function and maximize it. 

$$\text{Assets - Liabilities = Equity}$$ $$\Delta \text Equity =\text Profit$$ $$\text {Leverage ratio} = \frac{\text {Liabilities}}{\text{ Equity}}$$ Using these identites, it would become apparent that as the billionaires increases the leverage ratio, liabilities grow, equity stays constant, and there is no change in profit. What is described could multiply their assets, but also liabilities. They would not gain anything in profit. In the long run they might gain something in profit because more efficient capital structure. But they already should have capital structure that reflects their risk appetite and profitability desires. Also only banks legally have the ability to lend currency which they don't actually own. Other businesses don't have such legal rights (although they can leverage through other means, ie. corporate bonds). (The 2nd equation is not an identity, as there are other means of raising equity than profits, but it rather characterizes the situation. In addition, to be clear I am talking about their businesses, leverage ratio has little meaning when it comes to non-business life). 

Summary: The fear of future inflation causes treasury yields to rise today. Wider deficits also lead to higher yields because the supply of treasuries increases. This will lower the price of treasuries, which is the same as increasing yields. Now, why is the market buying dollars? The market is anticipating US consumers and government going into debt and driving up interest rates. In order to take advantage of these higher interest rates, one must have to have dollars to lend. But no, foreigners are not buying dollars because they are anticipating inflation...they are buying because they anticipate higher (real) interest rates. The inflation will come as a side effect of the anticipated spending spree and foreigners are expecting the inflation to be smaller than the rise in nominal interest rates. 

A reduction in trust in the USD (not just in US politicians) A good (better than the USD) alternative currency 

The price of a good is the equilibrium between the people buying and the people selling. A change in the money supply does not change how many goods there are to sell but it does change how many dollars the people buying them have. If people have more money, they will be willing to pay more, so the price goes up. 

I wrote some silly program where you just fix endowment $e=(e_1,e_2)$ and utility functions $u=(u_1(x_1,y_1),u_2(x_2,y_2))$. The example provides an illustration for your utility functions and $x_1+x_2=1$ and $y_1+y_2=1$. I've drawn 100 indifference curves on an equally spaced grid of given utility levels $\bar u_1\in[u_1(0,0),u_1(1,1)]$ (blue) and $\bar u_2\in[u_2(0,0),u_2(1,1)]$ (red). The black line is the contract curve. I added a second figure with some initial endowment $e_1 = (0.25, 0.75)$, $e_2 = (0.75, 0.25)$ and core. 

In Bertsekas (2005) Dynamic Programming and Optimal Control, Vol 1, 3rd ed., in Proposition 3.2.1 he states that solving for $V$ is the optimal cost-to-go function and the associated $u^*$ is optimal. However, he explicitly declares it as a sufficiency theorem. Actually, I just want to make sure, that if I've solved the HJB and recoverd the associated state and control trajectories, that I don't have to be concerned with any additional optimality conditions. Solution I Attempt I think I was able to derive necessary conditions from the maximum principle by the HJB equation itself. Define the hamiltonian \begin{align} H(x,u,V'(x)) := F(x,u) + V'(x)f(x,u) \end{align} then we have \begin{align} \rho V(x)=\max_u H(x,u,V'(x)) \end{align} which is \begin{align} \rho V(x)= H(x,u^*,V'(x)). \end{align} Define an arbitrary function $q:[0,\infty)\to\mathbb{R}$ with $q(0)=\lim_{t\to\infty} q(t)=0$. Now fix \begin{align} x = x^*+\varepsilon q \end{align} where $\varepsilon\in\mathbb{R}$ is a parameter. Plug the term into the maximized hamiltonian which gives \begin{align} \rho V(x^*+\varepsilon q)= H(x^*+\varepsilon q,u^*,V'(x^*+\varepsilon q)). \end{align} At $\varepsilon = 0$ we have the optimal solution. Thus differentite over $\varepsilon$ to get a first order condition \begin{align} \rho V'q = H_x q + H_{V'}V''q. \end{align} Now define the adjoint variable with \begin{align} \lambda = V'(x). \end{align} Differentiate over time \begin{align} \dot \lambda = V''\dot x. \end{align} and note that \begin{align} H_{V'} = f(x,u) = \dot x. \end{align} Plug everthing into the foc wich gives \begin{align} \rho \lambda = H_x + \dot \lambda. \end{align} That's it pretty much. So solving the HJB is indeed necessary and sufficient (omitted here) for optimality. Someone should add it to wiki. Might save time for people thinking about such problems (won't be a lot I reckon). However the transversality condition \begin{align} \lim_{t\to\infty} e^{-\rho t}\lambda(t) = 0 \end{align} is missing. II Attempt Define the payoff functional \begin{align} J(u):=\int^\infty_0 e^{-\rho t}F(x,u)dt \end{align} Note that \begin{align} \int^\infty_0{e^{-\rho t}\lambda[f(x,u) - \dot x]dt} = 0 \end{align} by definition of $\dot x = f(x,u)$. Add the neutral Term to the payoff funtional \begin{align} J(u)&=\int^\infty_0 e^{-\rho t}[F(x,u)+\lambda f(x,u)]dt - \int^\infty_0{e^{-\rho t}\lambda\dot xdt}\\ &=\int^\infty_0 e^{-\rho t}H(x,u,\lambda) - \int^\infty_0{e^{-\rho t}\lambda\dot xdt} \end{align} Integration by parts of the right term ond the rhs yields \begin{align} \int^\infty_0{e^{-\rho t}\lambda\dot xdt} = [e^{-\rho t}\lambda(t)x(t)]^\infty_0 - \int^\infty_0{e^{-\rho t}x(\dot \lambda-\rho\lambda)dt} \end{align} Resubstitute that term \begin{align} J(u)=\int^\infty_0 e^{-\rho t}[H(x,u,\lambda) + x(\dot \lambda-\rho\lambda)]dt - \lim_{t\to\infty}e^{-\rho t}\lambda(t)x(t) + \lambda(0)x(0) \end{align} Define \begin{align} x &= x^*+\varepsilon q\\ u &= u^*+\varepsilon p \end{align} which gives \begin{align} J(\varepsilon)=\int^\infty_0 e^{-\rho t}[H(x^*+\varepsilon q,u^*+\varepsilon p,\lambda) + (x^*+\varepsilon q)(\dot \lambda-\rho\lambda)]dt - \lim_{t\to\infty}e^{-\rho t}\lambda(t)[x^*(t)+\varepsilon q(t)] + \lambda(0)x(0) \end{align} FOC for maximum $J_\varepsilon = 0$ \begin{align} J_\varepsilon=\int^\infty_0 e^{-\rho t}[H_x q + H_u p + q(\dot \lambda-\rho\lambda)]dt - \lim_{t\to\infty}e^{-\rho t}\lambda(t)q(t) = 0 \end{align} Since $q$ and $p$ are unconstrained we must have \begin{align} H_u &= 0\\ H_x &= \rho\lambda - \dot \lambda\\ \lim_{t\to\infty}e^{-\rho t}\lambda(t) &= 0 \end{align} 

A stock is a claim on the profit of a company, along with the voting power to control that company and force it to pay out when you want it to. The value of every stock is defined by the payments (from the profit of the firm) the holder expects to get at some point. If the stock pays no dividends, it is because the stockholders have allowed management to plow that profit back into the firm in hopes of greater dividends down the line. Notice that payments may be in the form of (1) regular quarterly dividends, (2) special one-time dividends, or (3) stock repurchases. All of these are valid ways of taking the profit of the firm and giving it to the owners. Are there any firms that intend never to pay anything out? No. That would be some sort of non-profit organization. Metaphorically, think of asking the following quetion: "What if there is a bank account you keep putting money in but that will never allow withdrawals?" The question describes something that is not a bank account. All accounts eventually pay out, whether to the current owner or to one down the line. Similarly all profitable firms will eventually pay out the wealth they have accumulated for their owners. The value of the an ownership claim on the firm (i.e., its stock price) is exactly what people think the future payouts are worth.
