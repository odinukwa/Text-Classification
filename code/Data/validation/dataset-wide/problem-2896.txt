I notice two things that run through your steps. The first it is brought up again and again that the method (tool) used to implement consciousness does not inherently matter, but I believe it does. The book is not conscience because it can take no action (it is inert). The computer may be conscience because it can take action. I believe the ability to take action is at least one requirement for being conscience. The second is that the steps accept input from an external source. Is a remotely controlled robot conscience? Is there a difference between the "lookup table" and a remote pilot to a robot? I doubt people would see a remotely controlled robot as conscience, rather they would look to the controller. The flaws come in part from a poorly defined term "conscience". First, let me offer that I believe you mean consciousness. Consciousness is the state or quality of awareness, or, of being aware of an external object or something within oneself. We sometimes say being self-aware. Implied in the definition is that this awareness is a self-contained action. It does not come by virtue of a look-up table or any external other input. I am not saying that it is not learned, just that if learned, it does not require input to be maintained. Assuming that you accept that definition then step three is not valid because the system is not self-contained. Finally, all of the above steps assume a computational model for consciousness. That is to say that consciousness can be mapped into specific steps and choices based on inputs. You have not demonstrated that this is true. The requirements for the tool to implement consciousness depend on the answer to this question. So steps 1,2,4 and 5 are ambiguous. 

No, utilitarianism does not require altruism. No country or community ever purely subscribe to a single moral system like utilitarianism, but we can possibly say legal systems are somewhat based on consequentialism, in that we expect everyone to behave hedonistically except in situations where restrictions would be for the greater good for the rest of the community. Stealing, murder, defamation all have consequences under law. Lying, cheating, lack of manners have societal consequences. If we can make laws and incentives perfectly align with utilitarianism, we should expect people to behave accordingly. So an evil man can always behave in his own self interest and seek his own pleasures, and the consequences in a utilitarian system will drive the man to utilitarianism choices. It's absolutely reasonable for a selfish man play the system to ensure maximal benefits; we just need to make sure that the selfish choices also align with utilitarian choices. Given perfect incentivized utilitarian system, we should expect every sane reasonable individual to be utilitarian. Obviously, no country has perfect laws and we know our economic/workplace/societal incentives go against the greater good by default, so every society requires most of its citizens to behave altruistic or be empathetic to achieve some kind of utilitarianism. That said, in theory, individuals do not need altruism for utilitarianism. 

Assuming the Judeo-Christian God. 1) The modern Christian belief system asserts a "fallen" existence. Meaning that at one point everything was perfect, but things have become corrupt by the introduction of sin into the world. This is typically referred to as the fall. The high may be a result of this and therefore not part of the perfection that God intended. 2) The "high" itself is not the evil for most peoples perspective, rather the obsession with that high is the problem. This also may be a result of the fall as described above. 3) It is possible, even likely, that a benevolent God created materials which would result in pleasant feelings. Just as sexual intercourse results in pleasant feelings. Presumedly a benevolent God would create the means to have pleasant experiences as part of his creation. 

I'm having trouble reading this because all of the points stated about Ayn Rand and her philosophy are simply wrong. Anyone who has read any of her non-fiction will know this. As stated above, she bases everything back to the metaphysical(Following that of Aristotle, reality is absolute and the mind perceives it)...the Law of Identity..a thing is what it is..A is A. 2+2=4. If you agree with science and logic, and that reality is real and absolute, then you will like Ayn Rand and Objectivism. If you can refute her axioms EXISTENCE EXISTS or CONSCIOUSNESS....then you can prove her wrong...except you need to both exist and be conscious to contemplate the axioms(that is why they are called axioms folks...irreducible primaries)...so good luck. If you believe in a Platonic or Kantian metaphysics...ie you believe in God, Quantum Physics, String Theory, The Matrix etc.... Then her philosophy is not for you and you should continue to pray to God or stare at a spoon and try to bend it. Objectivism and Randism are different. An Objectivist does not have to agree 100% with Ayn Rand...although they WILL agree 99.9% with her because everything is based off of your primary tool of survival..YOUR MIND...RATIONALITY, REASON, LOGIC...Objectivists will almost always agree with each other because everything is based off of reasoning(deductive and inductive logic)..not like religions where morality is subjective according to how you interpret the book...and whether or not the book is full of contradictions which are emotional/whimsically followed or disregarded..... Objectivism is about integrating concepts and eliminating contradictions so that EVERYTHING works as a system...Objectivism is a closed system, meaning that every single piece affects the other... For example, when children are taught that 2+2=4 in grade school, and then they return from recess to learn that Jesus fed thousands with a few buckets of fish...an objectivist thinker...will question the teacher...because philosophy is about finding TRUTH...and the TRUTH is ABSOLUTE.... Morality is not subjective...it is OBJECTIVE... "Objective" simply means that when you look at the world(reality) it does not change according to your perception(subjective)...reality is absolute and you perceive it... Anyway, anyone on here bashing Rand without actually using REASON and LOGIC but instead attacking her with slander...When approaching the philosophy of Objectivism: "[There is a] dangerous little catch phrase which advises you to keep an “open mind.” This is a very ambiguous term—as demonstrated by a man who once accused a famous politician of having “a wide open mind.” That term is an anti-concept: it is usually taken to mean an objective, unbiased approach to ideas, but it is used as a call for perpetual skepticism, for holding no firm convictions and granting plausibility to anything. A “closed mind” is usually taken to mean the attitude of a man impervious to ideas, arguments, facts and logic, who clings stubbornly to some mixture of unwarranted assumptions, fashionable catch phrases, tribal prejudices—and emotions. But this is not a “closed” mind, it is a passive one. It is a mind that has dispensed with (or never acquired) the practice of thinking or judging, and feels threatened by any request to consider anything. What objectivity and the study of philosophy require is not an “open mind,” but an active mind—a mind able and eagerly willing to examine ideas, but to examine them critically. An active mind does not grant equal status to truth and falsehood; it does not remain floating forever in a stagnant vacuum of neutrality and uncertainty; by assuming the responsibility of judgment, it reaches firm convictions and holds to them. Since it is able to prove its convictions, an active mind achieves an unassailable certainty in confrontations with assailants—a certainty untainted by spots of blind faith, approximation, evasion and fear." - Ayn Rand If you are to attack her...attack her axioms first...attack aristotle's Law of Identity...or simple say out loud that you believe "Perception is reality"...in which case..go take some shrooms, or snort some coke, walk up to the roof of a tall building and see if when you feel, think, and believe you can fly, ....JUMP. 

The Problem of Induction does represent a problem for the philosophy that is often referred to as science. That empirical reasoning is not "proven" may or may not be a problem for you personally. Empiricism has lead to knowledge that is closer to true then what we had before. So empiricism is useful as the computer you are using to view this demonstrates. Is our current understanding of empiricism "true"? Almost certainly not. That is part of the philosophy of the sciences. The assumption that our current understanding is flawed in some way. This encourages people to suggest improvements. As a result our understanding improves over time. So no I do not have an issue with the problem of induction, it only represent another area where our understanding could improve. That science currently has flaws in its understanding of things is a strength, rather than a weakness. 

Not much at all, is the answer to question. However, it looks like the OP answers the question himself, since the question itself shows that all combinations of free will and intelligence exists. Modern philosophers still debate "free will", even the word itself is debated with compatibilists against non-compatibilists. In any case, definitions of free will have to do with the capacity to make choices among alternatives. Similarly, "intelligence" is something extremely vague with many desired attributes along a range. Its meaning not debated in philosophy at all, but generally definitions relate to the quality of said attributes. So as intelligence increases or decrease, quality increases or decreases. So as free will increases or decreases, the capacity to choose increases or decreases. On a graph, free will and intelligence could be the axes, and people would the the dots on the scatterplot. Plotted on the scatter plot will be people with great intelligence freely making choices, foolish people unable to make choices, or computers with powers of intelligence without consciousness, and animals being conscious without smarts. As the question implies, there's no pattern in the scatterplot. I'm sure you can keep changing the definitions of free will and intelligence so that they may have the barest connection, but generally there's not much relationship between free will and intelligence as they talk about different things by definition. (Disclaimer: I personally do not believe free will exists at all, so this question and answer is personally irrelevant to me. Note: Also, the question is about philosophy, not science. If it were about the nature of reality, then this answer would be much different... such wondering if a "brain" is the requirement for intelligence and the capacity to choose.)
