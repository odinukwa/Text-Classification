Mac v. PC -- (This one is slightly different, and probably less applicable to your scenario). There's enough variation in consumer preference to keep people switching from Mac to PC, or vice versa, when one side slips up or has a breakthrough, but there's not enough variation in consumer tastes to justify the existence of a third for-profit competitor. Apple and Microsoft both have huge infrastructures dedicated to producing a quality product, and an upstart third OS company would not have the resources to create a product as good, and no realistic chance of gaining a large enough number of users to generate the necessary revenues to become a competitor. In essence, the market is only big enough for two, based on costs of production, and amount of variation in tastes. 

Much, much less than the other answers suggest. If the aliens are at least a little bit smart about how they do this, I think they could pull this off with an army smaller than the German army during WW2. Why? You seem to be forgetting that the aliens: Have Nukes What? I thought this was pre-ww2 technology? Let me explain: The escape velocity of earth is 11.2km/s. In other words, if you drop a sufficiently large and heavy object to earth from rest, it will impact the earth at 11.2km/s (Air friction will reduce this number, but also the ship will probably be moving at a considerable speed to begin with). A 25 ton panzer tank moving at 11.2 km/s will impact with approximately 2% of the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima. This may not seem like a lot, but Germany produced 50,000 tanks during WW2. If the aliens tie 50 tanks in a bundle, and drop them at once, they essentially have 1,000 nuclear weapons. Did the aliens bring a navy with them? 1 capital ship will impact with the energy of 1,000 hiroshimas, which is on par with modern nukes. Assuming they brought 13 million infantry, and each infantry transport weighs as much as the ISS(450 tons) and transports 100 men, then they will have another 65,000 items which can impact with the energy of a Hiroshima. So, the strategy for the aliens is actually incredibly simple. Basically, destroy the entire surface of the earth, then send in a few million remaining infantry to colonize the earth(hopefully they brought some women), killing off the remaining survivors of Armageddon wherever they are found. Now, finding the absolute minimum number of troops they would need, basically depends almost entirely on the mass and number of the troop transports, and other vehicles. If the aliens are smart, they won't even bring an army or navy. They'll just bring a million tons of garbage with them. Edit: I just realized that the question specified "not mass genocide." Nonetheless, I don't think this really changes the answer. All the aliens have to do is nuke a few cities, and negotiate a surrender. Then just keep a bunch of stuff in orbit to drop on earth if earth ever rebels. 

You could definitely go either way with this one. On the one hand, humans eat chimpanzees, and seem to have no problem with that. On the other hand, if aliens came to earth and started eating chimpanzees, we might react a little more negatively, given their status as outsiders. You could also: Make the animals sacred Hindus are offended by eating cows, even though they don't consider cows to be their "cousins." Maybe your fox-people believe that fur is a spiritual thing, that the soul resides in the fur or something, but it's not even strictly necessary for this scenario. 

Applying this to your scenario, it could be that most people don't care what replaces the current system, inasmuch as they really just want the current system gone. Hence, there would be little support for a third faction, as people would just see it as a subtraction of resources from the rebellion that could be used against the Empire(In the same way that people saw Ralph Nader as just a subtraction from Al Gore's votes). Because starting a rebellion is very expensive, and everybody thinks the current rebellion is working out for them, there wouldn't be enough interest to generate a third faction. 

If they were humans, we would know. We can be pretty sure of this because humans/hominids have only existed for a few hundred thousand years, which isn't long enough for evidence of settlements to completely erode. However, go back far enough, and it's absolutely possible. After a few million years, for instance, the only real remnants of a civilization would be in the fossil record. If you find a disproportionately huge number of fossils of one species, spread all over the world, this could serve as inconclusive evidence of an intelligent species, as the only other species that has done this is man. The best form of evidence for an earlier civilization would be the presence of man made elements. If, for instance, levels of naturally occurring plutonium were much higher, that would indicate the existence of intelligent beings in the past who had nuclear technology. 

It seems artificial to have one of the founding fathers become King. This was an era when social classes were rigid, and it was a tremendous feat to join even the low-ranking nobility. If Washington or somebody else became King, they likely would not be seen as real monarchs by Europeans. Therefore, I think it's more realistic to have someone from an existing royal family, preferably the British Royal Family, to become the new king of America. Scenario 1: A member of the British Royal Family joins the revolution, lending legitimacy to the American cause in exchange for position as constitutional monarch in the new colonial government. Scenario 2: The colonists kidnap a member of the British Royal Family(while trying to make it seem voluntary, not a kidnapping), in order to lend legitimacy to their cause. The new "king" can deliver canned speeches, and serve as an important figurehead and source of central leadership for the founding fathers. Of course, the founding fathers are still in charge. 

Being Underwater/high pressure atmosphere Water's dense and easy to glide in, so everything evolves to glide. If you had a very dense atmosphere, you wouldn't need very big wings, and so the evolutionary expense would be minimal. Arboreal Environment As you say, arboreal environments are well-suited for the evolution of gliding(as in the flying squirrel), when the ability to leap from tree to tree reliably and quickly is required. Some people(not many, and even fewer scientists) think that birds evolved as tiny arboreal reptiles, and only later grew into big massive dinosaurs like the T-Rex. Open plains Most people, and most scientists think that bird flight evolved as an extension of running. Wings were originally used for stability while running by dinosaurs like Velociraptor, and once the wings became big enough, enabled gliding over short distances, as a way to conserve energy while chasing after prey. The animals are really just super-duper-tiny Because of the square-cube law, flying is much easier when you're super-duper tiny like insects. Hence, the animal evolves gliding when it's small, then through evolutionary pressure, becomes super-duper big, and no longer small. Near natural hot springs This one is pretty speculative, but if you're living near natural hot springs or a volcano, then there might be a lot more updrafts, allowing gliding to become a very efficient method of locomotion in your specific habitat. Big Leaves Another very speculative one. Say there's a plant that grows these huge leaves. An enterprising squirrel grabs hold of the leaf, and wham-o, he's soaring through the air using the leaf as a hang-glider. Now, the leaf has a seed attached, so the tree gets to spread its seed far and wide when it has a squirrel to steer it, and the squirrel gets a vehicle to travel wherever. So it's a symbiotic relationship. You could even imagine the tree evolving to become a cute little nursery for baby squirrels, and when they grow up, they take a leaf from the tree, and spread it to a new place, mate with another squirrel, and once the tree is fully grown, the female squirrel gives birth to her babies in the tree, and they raise a happy family together like good monogamous squirrels. Spiders Spiders like the one in Charlotte's web glide using sacks of spider silk. Now all you need is an enterprising spider who thinks to weave in rudders, flaps, and ailerons, and you've got yourself a little 8-legged hang glider right there. 

Colony Foundation If this war is fought on a large enough galactic scale, and settlement of enemy planets is your eventual goal, then it might be too wasteful in terms of time to have to send two waves of ships(robotic warships, then colony vessels only after the battle is won). Instead, have warships with male+female crews that can serve as colonists/administrators immediately upon victory(depending on whether the losing party will be completely wiped out, or just conquered).

The Empire and Rebellion share the same enemies While it seems difficult to make sure there's only one rebel group, it's easy to imagine a situation in which one rebel group is vastly predominant over other ones. In fact, there are many examples. For instance: 

To integrate this concept with your example, I would suggest that in your world there are really only two political ideologies that have any popular support with the commoners. The first is the caste system currently in place, of course. The second is unlikely to be something as radical as democracy or Socialism, or even a republic, and is more likely to take the form of a military dictatorship by a benevolent secular ruler, a theocracy, or some kind of fragmented city-state model. It could be that your world is young enough that only two forms of government have every really been tried, or it could be that the records of previous civilizations have been lost, or it could be that your society is extremely conservative. But for whatever reason, both the Empire and the Rebellion consider any third political ideologies to be far, far, more dangerous than they consider each other, and so will temporarily unite, for instance freely giving each other intelligence about third factions, just so they can be stamped out. Starting a third rebellion would be really difficult, and not worth the expense 

It depends on whether you're talking about basic cognition or full-on human-level thought. Animals for instance, can think without language, although their thoughts are of course much less complicated than human thought. On the other hand, children who are neglected and never learn to speak are severely mentally handicapped for the rest of their lives, not just in speaking, but in all areas of intelligence. This could indicate that language is important for cognition. Now, neither of these are really very convincing. But my opinion is that the answer to your question is, no. Anecdotally, athletes don't think to themselves in words when they make split-second decisions on the field. Nor do great musicians or mathematicians. Again, that's not a fully convincing example, so let me try a philosophical tack. Can language really be the fundamental unit of thought? That is, when a thought first pops into your mind, does it come pre-formed with words assembled into sentences and paragraphs? If this is the case, how would people be able to think of things that they do not have words to express, such as complicated 3-dimensional reasoning, or music? And isn't human language just a fundamentally clumsy way to express thought? How often do we struggle to say what we really mean? As an analogy, can you imagine building a computer that "thinks" in English, or even a programming language? Sure, a computer can transcribe its thoughts into a high-level language. But the thoughts, when they are first thought, come as a string of 0s and 1s, and are only later turned into something that can be expressed. Noam Chomsky believes that humans do a similar thing, that humans think in a universal "language of thought," which is only later transcribed into spoken languages like English. Steven Pinker goes in depth into this in The Stuff of Thought, and also The Language Instinct, of which I highly recommend the latter. 

It sounds like you're talking about a reputation-based economic system, where people don't work for money, but reputation instead(like StackExchange). The farmers would grow crops because people would respect the value of feeding others. Truckers would bring crops into the city, because people would respect the truckers for providing this service. Everybody would work for the approval and respect from others. This would superficially function very similarly to a money-based capitalist society, except that people's "paychecks" would be based on how much others believed their work to be worth, rather than how much their work was actually worth. This system would have its checks and balances just like a capitalist one. For instance, if garbage started piling up, people would realize that garbage men provide a very valuable service, and they would begin to respect garbage workers a lot more. This incentivizes more people to become garbage workers, and the garbage problem is alleviated. There would be some notable problems in such a society. Without money as a fundamentally mathematical mechanism to determine the value of a service, inefficiencies would arise. A farmer could gain much more respect by bringing in 10 truckloads of crops into the city, even if the trucks where only half-filled, because people can't see how full the trucks are from the outside. Another problem is that there would be no incentives for jobs that don't yet exist. If someone wants to provide a valuable service that has never before been provided, there is no existing incentive to do so, as people don't know about it. Facebook would never have been created, as nobody really believed in the beginning that it would have had value. Mark Zuckerberg could have gained more reputation by being a farmer, which is a known and respected trade, instead of doing something that many would have considered useless. Therefore, innovation would stagnate under such a system.
