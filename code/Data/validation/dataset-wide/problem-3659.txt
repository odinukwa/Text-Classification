Precisely what foods you need to focus on is going to depend entirely on your past diet, your current health situation, and your goals. There are, however, a few basics that anyone can implement for a better life pretty much right away. 

You're older. As we age, our body processes move less and less smoothly, and that includes metabolism. A professional can assess your body's ORGAN fitness, not just your MUSCLE fitness, and get an idea for what diets are appropriate. If you still have the stomach of a 20 year old, the calorie count may be all you care about. If you've developed a few quirks along the way, you might have to adhere to a more strict, digestible diet (such as the Paleo diet) to give your organs some time to patch themselves up. You're an engineer. I myself am a computer programmer, so I have something of an idea of how our minds work. We like numbers, we like knowing specifics, and we like being in control. A professional will be able to tell you, down to the single calorie, how many calories your body burns simply existing. They can also equip you with a heart monitor band and watch setup that will allow you to see exactly how many calories you are burning during any one workout. Some more advanced models can even break down your heart rate into workout zones so you can target your workout to hit the most fat-burning zones. I personally wear a Polar RS300 and love the crap out of it. I am never in the dark as to how many calories I need to eat. 

Your flexibility is inversely related to how injury-prone you are. The more flexible you are, the less likely you are to accidentally injure yourself during training. This is true of major injuries, but it is also true of minor injuries that leave you stiff and sore for 3-4 days (when you should be bouncing back after 1 day of rest, ideally). Flexibility also means that you're less likely to hurt yourself in a fall or other accident as you age. In terms of intensity of workout to health benefit, flexibility training will give you the biggest payout of almost any exercise out there. All that said, I'm not sure why you're having so much trouble limbering up. My suspicion is that you are not performing the stretches properly, or the stretches you are doing aren't addressing your real issue. A personal trainer would be able to tell you more simply because they can physically look at you and see how your body is working. 

It won't directly, but it can indirectly. You have to have a decent calorie surplus to grow muscle - otherwise your body can't build on what you've done in the gym, and you won't grow any muscles. Running alongside your workout can burn the extra calories that you were going to use to build muscle. This is probably what your friends are referring to. There's nothing inherent about running that damages muscle gains though. Be aware: If you stop your cardio workout, you could hit a plateau very quickly. Your muscle gains are dependent on you exhausting your muscles. If you don't exhaust your muscles, your body will never get the signal that it needs to be stronger and bigger. If your heart and lungs are not up to the task of exhausting your muscles, you'll never grow that way, either! There are two main approaches to balancing these demands: 

I'm not familiar with this particular supplement, but I can answer your question of figuring out how much is muscle and how much is water. You can go to a professional and have them measure your lean, fat, and water weights by conductivity through your body, but that is relatively expensive and time consuming. Doing it at home basically requires that you weigh yourself often and get a handle on your median weight. The reason I say 'median weight' is because you can gain or lose as many as 5 pounds a day just in water weight, depending on how much you drink, how hard you work, and even just how dry the environment around you is. It's impossible to properly control. So weigh yourself 3 times a day for a few days, and get the median of those weights. This will give you a figure that is reasonably close to your 'true' weight by only using a common scale. Any changes of more than a few pounds are going to almost certainly indicate muscle or fat growth - in your case, I'd say it's a safe guess that most of the difference would be muscle. 

Asymmetric pain usually means either some sort trauma-based injury (e.g. banging your knee) or muscle imbalance. Without more detail on your wife's habits it's difficult to say which, but I can give you a general idea of how to isolate it. If it is a trauma-based injury, the pain will typically be localized to a specific area (for example, the dorsal plane of the oblique), and will be mostly triggered by a specific motions (such as biking). A persistent trauma-based injury usually requires specific attention. Deep tissue massage (such as A.R.T.) will break up inflexible scar tissue and allow gentle rehabilitating exercises to build it back up. If it is a muscle imbalance, the pain will be more generalized (the sufferer is more likely to say 'my hip hurts' as opposed to 'it hurts right here'), and will mostly be triggered by generalized stress. Fatigue, a variety of exertion activities, etc. Muscle imbalances are extremely common and the solution is basically to strengthen the weaker muscle, usually by doing some sort of focused strengthening exercise that will work out both instances of the muscle. One side will feel pretty exerted and the other will feel fairly fresh, but that's how eliminating imbalances works. 

Your fundamentals look very good. I can't see any major problems or inconsistencies with your workout. As a result, none of my following suggestions should be taken in the spirit of a large overhaul or immediate change. They should instead be taken as just that - suggestions and options. With that qualified, here they are: 

This is going to depend on the course you do, what gear you stay in while cycling, how severe your bursitis is, etc. It's impossible to say for sure, particularly if your bursitis was caused by injury. All that said, my basic suggestion would be "proceed with caution". It will be important to be as light on yourself as possible. The cycling motion is going to involve your hip almost as much as the running motion does, so you'll need to be careful not to overwork the injury. Under normal circumstances I'd very much encourage it, as proper exercise helps the healing process a great deal, but if you are already training on running it's important to consider the other extreme. Rest is needed for all training to take effect. I don't wish to warn you off; if done properly, it will likely help your training regimen a good amount, help keep your injury mobile and healing, and, most importantly, be fun. But nothing is less fun than hurting yourself. If you have access to a pool, I think a safer way to cross-train would be to swim laps or do water aerobics. This will give you the loosening, aerobic workout you're looking for without absolutely requiring your hips to be in the picture. But if you don't, cycling should be fine as long as you keep in mind that it's a rest day and muscle exhaustion is not the goal. 

The question is a little awkward to answer, but I'll do my best. Net weight drop is going to depend on how many more calories you've burned than you've taken in, and the heart rate you maintain while exercising (since that influences whether you burn fat or sugar). Zumba in and of itself isn't going to be any more or less effective than any other form of dance if the two keep your heart at its target rate (70-80% of its max) for roughly the same amount of time. Dance as a whole is a very good way to accomplish these ends, though, since most dance styles are developed to be fairly easy to pick up, sustainable for at least a good 20-30 minutes, and fun to do. Zumba definitely fills these points, so chances are pretty good it'll be quite effective at busting weight. As far as 'more effective', that's going to depend on the dance style you're comparing it to. Swing dancing is probably just as effective, break dancing...likely not so much. 

Be aware that there are two types of fiber out there - digestible fiber and indigestible fiber. Digestible fiber comes from the fiber in and attached to starches and sugars, mostly. Think the fiber in whole-wheat bread and brown rices. You do NOT want digestible fiber if you are looking to increase your fiber intake. I bring this up so when you see 'fiber' on a loaf of bread, you'll know it's not the fiber you want. What you're looking for is more indigestible fiber - cellulose and lignin - to increase your gut mobility and water retention. The best foods for these are green or fibrous vegetables. You may have just gone ugh! in your mind, but there are a lot of people who initially have that reaction that end up loving their veggies once they realize what's out there. The salads you're most familiar with are overwhelmingly likely to have paper-like lettuce beneath twice-frozen carrots, preserved cherry tomatoes, and other such poor-quality ingredients. If you get yourself some fresh, organic baby spinach and toss it up with sliced strawberries, chopped almonds or cashews, and dust it lightly with feta crumbles, your tune toward a salad could change very rapidly indeed. You can check out this page to give you some idea of where to start, but if you don't see something you want right away, just google for 'high-fiber vegetables' and you'll get all sorts of information.
