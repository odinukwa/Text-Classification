Teach the children chi-unrelated martial arts from a young age (~2years young) - this has, just like in our world, several positive effects in general: They will get to know their body and how to interact with it and the world, they will learn discipline (mainly because discipline is necessary to avoid injury as most people come to realize quite naturally when they do sports) and they will learn that they are capable of inflicting terrible injuries on themselfs and others. (The main point of many martial arts is to gain control over power output, not increase.) Around age ~4 children become increasingly aware of 'chi', probably by accidently using it - starting from this point they will incorporate it into their usual training in order to gain control of it (much like an extension of their body). Think of things like breathing techniques but for 'chi'; in reality we use them to gain a better understanding of our body and mind, and when you add chi to the mix it's a very safe way of getting used to this new 'body part' since the effort and output can be finely regulated rather quickly. I choose age 4 because that's given the children 2 years of time to get to know their physical body. You may think that's too early (in fact, there won't be any conflict or elaborate technique in martial arts that early on), but at such a young age children are incredibly good at grasping concepts, even if they can't explain it or seemingly don't do it right. In other words, they will understand how to move their bodies, even if they are not physically capable yet of making it look especially smooth. As the children improve their control over chi and grow their minds mature as well. Before, they might have been told not to overdo it, but I'd say at age 7 it's high time to have proper discussions and explanations of the explicit dangers of overusing 'chi' and, much more important yet, how to recognize when it has been overused (this also means that I would afterwards start to gradually reduce any safety buffers against overuse, for them to gain experience in recognizing their limits). Much like one needs to be told that some muscle pain is perfectly okay, and some isn't. Lighter versions of these explanations will have been given throughout the years already, I'm just saying overtly simple arguments may not be enough to satisfy/convince the children anymore. Oh, explanations will probably also get shorter and shorter as they grow older, albeit more complicated (the simplest answers for toddlers are often the most elaborate ones one ever comes up with for a question). Afterwards, since control over 'chi' is the main concern in order to improve efficiency for their later lifes, proper 'chi' practice will be included in the training plan. It is important not to neglect the original martial arts however, as it's beneficial to balance different kinds of strains ('chi', non-'chi' mental training, normal physical training etc). Starting around age 11 children have gotten a proper foundation and understanding in both martial arts and the art of 'chi' from a fundamental control point of view. It may be time to let them have a go at the wonders of using 'chi' for things like stitching (without touching the needle) or building LEGO castles etc. Make sure these things are just as properly supervised in order to avoid overuse of 'chi' - the children might know their limits, but everyone forgets their limits while having fun (such as reading a novel all the way into the next day, always thinking "just one more page"). Gradually introduce a greater variety and greater specialisations of 'chi' applications, and have them get emersed in what they want. Perhaps they don't really want to use their 'chi' anyway, that should be fine too. Getting closer to age 18, but at the latest then, you will need to REDO all explanations and fundamental physical and 'chi' training methods they've done as little children. Why? Because they have gotten sloppy at their fundamentals and are not in touch with themselfs on such a broadly deep level as they were at age 9 or 11. And why is that? 'Cause their minds are filled with a life full of experiences that overshadow such basic, now almost instinctive knowledge. This is also a point where many athletes and such fail to do an overhaul of their abilities and gradually get worse. Now, don't get me wrong - I'm mostly referring to getting worse at truly understanding what one now doesn't even thinks about. Not having to think about it is a good thing, but that stops being true when one cannot understand it anymore. An example, do you remember how you learned to use a fork? Even if you don't that's fine - as long as you can still explain to others how to use a fork. We want to avoid a situation where one can use a fork themself but has become incapable of explaining how one does it - just transfer that to the martial/'chi' arts and you'll see that 'chi' at least ain't something you want to get sloppy with. Thanks to the previous step the children, now young adults, can pretty much use their 'chi' without any harmful side effects at great efficiency while understanding their abilities. From here on some may choose to further train their bodies and mind to increase their general capability to exert more force and more intensively focus on something. At this point they are capable of expanding their own horizons by their own strength. 

Practical is such a misunderstood word. It often is taken to mean possible. But really it means efficient. Your question is asking not are laser eyes possible but are they useful. It sounds like you are asking both questions though. Is it possible? Superman is alien. By definition not human. So comparisons to the human eye are a bit of a waste of time in his case. Superman is stronger faster and nearly indestructible. Sounds to me like any damage he could do to himself is nullified by his indestructibility. He flies into the sun for a recharge. A little laser wont bother him. As for where he gets his power. He flies into the sun for energy. He is solar powered. And the sun easily has the power to fuel laser eyes. The real question is it useful. A built in high powered perfectly accurate weapon? Yes it is useful. As for humans with laser eyes see the other answers here. But I thought it was worth pointing out the obvious exception to most of them. 

Unasked question: What is the internet? The internet is a bunch of computers connected to each other. To answer your question you will want to know some of the basic layers of the internet. I'm simplifying this but it should be enough to get you in the right direction. It's also worth noting that what is commonly referred to as the internet is actually the World Wide Web. And is only a small piece of the internet. File server, secure data servers, private networks, telephone lines, and someones publicly accessible hard drive on the home computer are all part of the internet as well. Physical layer - The internet must physically transfer data. This is done through phone lines (twisted pair), Ethernet cables (bundled twisted pair), Fiber optic cables (glass), Microwaves (electromagnetic), Radio waves (electromagnetic), etc. Your first task will be to determine how to connect physically to the internet. Radio waves or microwaves will depreciate too much to get to a satellite. You could run a relay to the top of the ocean (say 100ft under to keep hidden from ships). But this would results in nearly 2sec of latency (satellites are as far from the earth as it's circumference and it takes 1 sec for light to travel the circumference of the earth. It would be better to run some kind of fiber line to the nearest hosting facility getting you the expected 1/2s latency for most information. Packet/Data/Security Layer - You can't just read the data in the internet. It is encrypted, encoded, and packetized. Lets assume your computer is powerful enought to learn all this from context. Not realistic to be honest but it could learn via TV or Radio what it needs to get past the encoding and packetizing. So just play this off as "my computer is faster than earths entire technology infrastructure combined times 1 million or something like that." Protocol Layer - Most of the information on the internet is meta data not content. HTML tags, CSS, Javascript, etc. Browsers interpret all of this for us. Even the most intelligent of machines may need some help understanding what goes where. It would be appropriate for your machine to have a learning curve when displaying content. How do I connect to the internet? Probably with a piggyback line on a fibre optic cable or transcontinental microwave reciever. Either way somethign will physically have to leave the ship to intercept a decent signal and relay it back. Can I connect as a passive observer? Not really. You can do a "man in the middle" but you will only see what the specified "man" or "men" see. You will not be able to request specific data making it rather pointless. Can I connect without giving away my position? Not really. If you are just observing sure. but if you want info you need to give the "internet" an address to return the information too. No matter what the movies tell you you can't hide. If you were hidden you wouldn't be able to receive the information you requested. You can rapidly change the path the information travels if you control a dns but it still all has to end somewhere. 

Historically, there were western European settlements only accessible from the sea. You had a wilderness trek to get there by land, and medievals mostly hated wilderness. The forest will get pushed back as it is used for lumber (boatyards), firewood, and fields to grow food. 

3) Satellites: easy to fool with an image perpetuated from just before the attack. Project it above the site so the satellites perceive it as the actual surface. Only has to last 24-48 hours. They may want to spend 24 hours hovering to take a full noon-to-noon cycle to cover the night changes in artificial lighting. 2) Choice of country can make all the difference. The more wired the country, the more mobile the population, the more outsiders will notice the lack of Facebook updates or be more likely to drive to through. It has to be off regular rail or air service, only a weekly or biweekly at best. Of course, villages are easier. But I think you want the largest place they can get away with, right? Otherwise they could avoid destructions and set up in the middle of uninhabited nowhere at leisure. So what are the human facilities they need out of the village/town that they can't get at some deserted lake in northern Canada? How is a rural village in Nigeria or a small town in the Philippines any better? 1) Timing is critical. If it's a ski resort, don't hit on a February weekend. Look for when it is most deserted, with the fewest outsiders coming in. Not on a convention weekend. Major cities and capitals are off the list. I'm seeing a seaside resort in off season, still cold if not snowy, and a major storm (blizzard, sleet, rain) may have knocked out communications normally in the area. This question is going to take people from all over piling on with their suggestions of a good town in their area that suits the shopping list. This could probably be best as a separate question: this is my set-up; what towns in your knowledge would you suggest? Otherwise, you get to invent a place. Some small towns get most of their traffic on weekends, with the weeks isolated. Some act as bedroom communities, with lots of commuting on the weekdays but people stay home and mow the lawns on the weekend. Do you have a positive or negative preference in continents or countries for the setting? Like, you just don't think you can handle the cultural differences of setting this in the USA or Mongolia or wherever? Obviously, this target must be within fleeing distance of the second town where the survivor goes. On foot, maybe thirty miles in two days (assuming he isn't an ultra-marathoner). On horse, maybe seventy miles if he got a good one. On bicycle? Moped? Motorcycle? What will he find to use? 

Steppe peoples used yurts on wheels and tent cities. So have armies, and medieval tents could be very large and multi-room, albeit with a whole lot of interior poles and trusses. For your large buildings, consider the 1800s circus tent transported on wagons, not only the canvas but the king pole, half poles, quarter poles, and all the ropes and pegs, tools and seating to boot. Now, speed. The usual wagon animals on the steppe and in China were oxen. They are the strongest, so you need the fewest animals (which have to be fed grain on the march as there isn't time for them to graze. Crazy as it sounds, the Chinese ox drawn army travelled c. 3 miles per day. Horses and mules are faster, but you need 3 or 4 times as many. Look into gigantic English road waggons of the 1700s and early 1800s right before railroads. They made about 20 miles/day on good roads. So figure 10 m/d. This is a good walking speed for humans. Still, you will need advance parties to start out weeks early to put down depots for food, fodder, forage, and firewood for everyone else. 

Clever idea. Worth considering a common "God problem." Does God exist inside of time and move freely or does he exist outside of time and poke the continuum to make things happen (thus everything happens at the same time from his perspective)? The answer to that philosophical debate is usually: It doesn't matter because the manifestation is the same either way. God appears to be unaffected by time. Magic existing and eliminating itself from existence has the net effect that it never existed. This is how it is handled in Michael Crichton's Sphere (the book I haven't seen the movie). We watch the disappearance of the magic then at the end of the book it never existed. Option 1: The Remnant. Your much better option is the Star Wars or Dr. Who approach. While it may feel cheep some of the best literature chooses a protagonist who sees, hears, or posses something the rest of the world does not. Making them interesting and allowing us to see the world through more informed eyes. This is often in modern day called a "Space Opera". Star Wars. The force doesn't exist anymore because all users died out. We know it existed once from legend but it doesn't matter nor do we understand the effects because no one uses it. Oh! Except this one guy who somehow survived the force genocide. Dr. Who. Very similar but this time it's a survivor. Maybe the magic was used up by one wizard who discovered the secret of immortality. He basically used all the energy of the earth to give himself life. In the process he also erased all other magic users from existence. Sort of a philosophers stone now. He has limitless power bought at the life of everything. Now your informed character can be the antagonist that some informed cult is hunting down or a protagonist that perhaps wishes to pay penance by restoring life to humanity but doesn't know how. Option 2: Artifacts or Secondary Effects. I was impressed to learn that archaeologist identify an ancient city or town by a few simple indicators. The one that caught my attention was the Right Angle. A single right angle tells them that something about this site is human made and unnatural. While no human remains were found, no actual structures, no pottery or tools, a single rock cut in a right angle says everything they need to know. Magic while never existed was not actually undone (If it was catch 22 it would have undone it's own undoing...). So perhaps their are "pieces of eden", Assasin's Creed floating around that everyone knows is from a past "technology" perhaps even magic. Or maybe their is ancient indestructible structures that are damaged and still around like "elder glass" in Lies of Locke Lamora by Scott Lynch. Option 3: Writings (much simpler) Tomes are likely gone but what about the stories. While they may be dismissed as folk tales they likely still exist and there is probably someone crazy enough to believe them. Option 4: Void Fish In a D&D podcast "The Adventure Zone" they have a creature that makes everyone forget something existed until you drink it's pee (episode 5 or 6 I think). Weird but the idea is maybe this fish or artifact ate the magic and contacting the artifact gives information about it's existence.
