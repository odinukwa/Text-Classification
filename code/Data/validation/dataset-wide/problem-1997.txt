I would say that, first of all, it is important to stay technically on top of your field, even in addition to being a good people manager. You ask, ""will managerial skills alone stay in demand, without a complement of technical skills?" This question assumes that you have any managerial skills. Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to insult you, but I think that's a very dangerous assumption to make - because if you're wrong, and as a result, you neglect your technical abilities, you may find yourself out of a job. Assuming you're not a good manager will let you determine what you need to do next to improve. I often see managers in the technical field who have no managerial skills or technical skills. As is often the case, they are strong coders that get promoted to lead groups of coders. Of course, they never had any leadership skill, it was all coding skills. And since now they are no longer responsible for day-to-day coding, they get sloppy. So, for starters, my advice would be to please assume both your management skills AND your technical skills need constant improvement. In regards to staying on top of your field 

(n.b.: In Canada (and in other countries I'm sure), if you are self-employed, an amount is automatically added to your hourly wage to compensate for lost benefits. For example, if your benefits are calculated to be worth $10000 / year, and you are working for $20/hr as an independent contractor, you would actually receive $25/hr on your paycheque, but be responsible for your own benefits.) Full-time employees tend to contribute a lot more than contractors, especially in terms of late hours, weekends, etc. As a contractor, I've never, not once worked a single unpaid hour, having billed judiciously for all of them. But as a full-time employee it's the 'norm. Moreover, full-time employees get the shaft once again, because benefits, severance and all that good stuff doesn't tend to kick in for 3 months. This can be a long time, especially in web development, where the entire field undergoes a sea change every 6. That being said, you would think compensation would be about equal. In fact, compensation for contract workers is really set on a case-by-case basis. There are thousands of competencies in web development, and a company may have a desperate need for, say, an Analytics Deployment Expert. This contractor may receive 2-3x the wages of a similar developer, not because of some magical contract multiplier, but because of the urgency and professionalism with which he brings his skills. So, in conclusion, companies may be prepared to pay anywhere from 1.25x - 3x+ their usual full-time wage for a contractor, if the timing is right. I find a good strategy is just ask for a really, really high number. Then, if they can't afford it, ask what they can afford, and go from there. 

A homework exam is good news. If you are given a homework assignment that you actually do correctly, you are almost certain to get the job. Very few employers will interview you, decide you are good enough to do the take-home, see that you did very well on it, and not hire you. Almost every homework assignment I have been given has lead to a job offer. Moreover, you should enjoy doing them... if you don't, why are you applying for this particular job? I don't find this exploitative. Most of the time, employers will give you a sample test that has no relevance to their business. And even if they were open to having unwitting applicants do their own work as part of an interview, would you really trust someone you've only just met, whose competence is still in question, with your business? 

Actually the most valuable thing I learned in College was how to answer this question correctly. "Where do you see yourself in ten years?" "Working for you guys, of course!" If you are not answering this question exactly as above, then that is what you are missing. There is no other correct answer. If they ask you to elaborate... "OK... doing what for us, specifically?" "I will probably doing exactly what your are hiring me to do now, but I'll be even better at it then and work even harder." 

You are very likely under a covenant of non-competition (refer to your contract). This is designed to protect employers from just what you propose. However, it is not designed to prevent you from competing EVER, just in the present, while they still have an advantage. Usually, you will have to wait 1-2 years. It should be a number laid out clearly in your contract. And you should wait until the non-competition agreement expires, or you can be sued for a significant amount of coin. 

It's good that you are taking the initiative and asking for advice! It sounds like in this case, you're pretty justified in wanting to leave you work. 

I think it is important detail that you are applying for a job as a senior software developer and the person warning you is a customer service agent. You don't need to go as far as Japan to see cases where workplaces expect their employees to work longer than 9-5 hours. However, the more senior and less replaceable you are, the less this happens. I would say if a company is willing to hire you from Japan they probably badly need the services you offer, and would probably welcome you discussing it with them rather than not accepting on the basis listed above. Summary: you have nothing to do by discussing the work arrangement with the prospective company in advance and getting the expectations of working hours in writing. 

The trick to qualifying someone over the phone is to have a discussion rather than a QA. It's important to go on a tangent after each question, as this will reveal whether the candidate is truly knowledgeable. YOU: (prepared question) What is a type of database language? THEM: One kind is MySQL. YOU: (moving into a trickier kind of question) What's another? THEM: Another would be noSQL. YOU: (this is the real question) Could you please contrast these two, with examples on where you would use each, and close with your favorite? THEM: (if they are qualified, a sensible answer will follow. If they are not, or cheating, odds are there will be a long pause followed by an answer you don't really buy.) The best way to hire them is by making sure the interviewer has all the skills you want to find in the interviewee. As they say, it takes one to know one. Summary 

Zugzwang: $URL$ Zugzwang (German for "compulsion to move", pronounced [ˈtsuːktsvaŋ]) is a situation found in chess and other games wherein one player is put at a disadvantage because they must make a move when they would prefer to pass and not move. Probably, if you do as you're asked, you'll be fired for violating company policy. If you don't, you'll be fired for insubordination. Just quit. 

Different software companies have different overall levels of skill for their developer. A junior developer at an extremely elite tech house (Twitter, StackExchange) would probably be as skilled as a senior developer in a place that doesn't have as high a level of skill. So if you would like the better title, simply go work for a worse company, and you will appear more senior simply by context. 

The longer a company drags their feet, the less likely you are to get the job. After 2-3 days, you should effectively begin acting as though you will not be offered the job. They may come back sometime after that with an offer, but it is not likely. 

I'd say there's no way to cherry pick the co-workers you invite without offending many who you don't. Like your kindergarten teacher says, "If you don't have enough to share with the whole class, don't bring it to school." 

Startup ventures are often constructed in such a way, like how you describe, where short-term lack of cash is supplemented by offering equity or other bonuses in exchange for working for a reduced pay. However, any agreements you have which are not in writing are basically nonexistent. Unless you made an agreement in writing, wherein after a specific period of time, a set portion of the ownership of the company would transfer to you, then there is no agreement. The owner has absolutely no obligation to give you any equity at all and probably won't. I say this because, if he is a prudent business owner, he is probably not in the habit of giving away large chunks of his company. That being said, I worked at a startup where there was a fellow in the same position as you. The owner offered him a share of equity at some point, and even though it was not in writing, he gave it to him. Or at least, as he told me, he made the man a "partner." I'm not sure what this means but I think it's likely the owner still makes a vast majority of the money for the company. You should also consider the fact that an agreement, in which ownership of a company is split, especially if that number if 50%, are very complicated, and require a lawyer to draft them. Even if the owner did agree to, out of the blue, give you 50% of the company, there would still be a long, legal process in which all contingencies are examined. This process is also very expensive. You are essentially proposing to buy 50% of his business in exchange for your continued sweat equity. This is a bit of a stretch, and for the reasons mentioned above, he may not want to split ownership of the company at all, due to the costs incurred for doing that. In conclusion, my advice is to understand the process of business ownership much better before asking for equity. I recommend Michael T. Lechter's book, Other People's Money, in which he talks in detail about this. 

You may receive a cheque directly from Company A Company B may not know how well you are compensated Only very rarely, your placement at that company may be confidential 

Having had this happen to me many times before, I believe the appropriate thing to say is, "Thank you very much for your time. We'll be in touch if we're interested." //handshake Since I'm assuming this person is not already intimately aware of your company's interview process, what does it matter if you "cut the interview short?" How would they even know if the interview is supposed to be 10, 20 or 45 minutes? 90% of the interview process is dealing with unsuitable candidates. If every position was best filled by the first person applying, there would be no need for interviews. Therefore, if you know the candidate you are dealing with is unsuitable, deal with it in a professional manner by concluding the interview. 

It's more than reasonable to deny your employer's request, it's just common sense. Non-compete agreements have less to do with you than with your employer and their competitors - they don't want you working for their competitors. In fact, the only reason why non-compete agreements do not last forever is because the law (at least in Canada) limits the length of those stipulations. Considering laws exist to protect employees from excessive non-compete agreements, it's a safe conclusion to assume they're bad for you. Having been personally stopped by non-compete agreements in the past, there is usually nothing to gain as an employee by being restricted by one of these. Odds are your employer will not be willing to compensate you a fair amount to sign this, as I would estimate that value as at least 10% of the annual salary of the employee, you should just simply not sign it.
