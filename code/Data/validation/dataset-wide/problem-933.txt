Based on the dimensions you provided and the photograph, the density is likely between 5 and 9 g/cm3, assuming cylindrical volume with height between 2.8-3 inches and radius between 0.4-0.5 inches. Based on this density and the weak magnetic properties, you have an iron-rich rock. Most fossils are comprised of calcite or a mineral with a similar density of around 3 g/cm3, with the exception of cases where metallic minerals replace the original material. The location provided is useful. However, I could not find a Cressy River, and I assume you are referring to the Merced River. This area flanks mountains that are rich in gold placer deposits and associated minerals, including iron. It is most probable that you found a iron-bearing mineral associated with the igneous or metamorphic rocks in the mountains.

Crystal settling and partial melting follow the Bowen's reaction series (pictured), which tells you which minerals melt at which temperatures. This is essentially the same process of distillation of alcohol by separating it from water, which has a lower temperature of vaporization. Each of these processes allows for a unique rock chemistry, even within the same batholith. While we categorize magmas into different groups based on their geochemistry, we must keep in mind that the geochemistry of any igneous rock falls along a sliding (not discrete) scale (i.e. not every granite is the same). Otherwise igneous petrology would be really easy. See the wikipedia article on igneous differentiation for more information. 

If you were hoping for a smooth succession from Archean all the way down to Quaternary, you're going to be disappointed. Geology is messier than rocks being serenely laid down continuously through time like that. A drive from the Appalachians to the East Coast would get you everything but the Archaean rocks, although the only Proterozoic rocks would be found in the Piedmont. The tough part is finding rocks of Archaen age. Although the North American craton contains Archaen rocks, they are only at the surface in northern Wisconsin and Minnesota (That is, if we restrict ourselves to the United States as you asked), and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. There are a few outcrops in the Black Hills of South Dakota. Here's a link to a large detailed geological map of the three states. But this is just the bedrock geology. The trouble with looking for Archean age rocks in northern Wisconsin and Minnesota, of course, is that these areas are mostly covered by glacial till from recent ice ages (although you might find an Archean glacial erratic that the ice sheets carried down from Canada). Archean outcrops might be small and inaccessible. 

From an Earth Science standpoint, it's meaningless to ask about the "source" of a river in this way. The "source" of a river is the rainfall within its drainage basin, which percolates down into groundwater, and the "river" appears where the land has eroded down below the water table. The Amazon has an enormous drainage basin: 

Firstly, I'd like to state that so far there is no evidence that a civilization similar to ours has appeared on Earth before us. It might be apparent that we as a species have left quite a significant geological footprint, (if we didn't Archeologists would be out of a job!), and as of yet we've discovered no evidence to indicate a civilization that cannot be explained by either our species or our close relatives, such as Neanderthals. Also this evidence is completely contained within the last few hundred thousand years (very recent in Geological time). In addition for 'eukaryote' life forms to exist (such as humans) oxygen is required so that respiration can occur. If we look at evidence for oxygen in Earth's atmosphere for the majority of it, oxygen is purely a trace element, and simply not enough to sustain complex life forms (as we know it I might add!). This would suggest that not only is there no evidence for complex life forms to exist, there is evidence that complex life forms are simply not possible for most of Earth's history. 

Essentially, life on Earth before about 540 million years ago (The so called Cambrian 'Explosion') was a little boring, as in it was primary simple multi-cellular organisms that didn't have many hard parts (the bits that get recorded in the fossil record). Think like a sponge today. These kind of life forms have a pretty poor preservation potential as its called, so before about 550 million years ago the fossil record (in terms of actual fossils) is absolutely terrible. However we do have existence of life before this time, despite this. For example the Stromatolites which go back 3.5GA. And while fossils as we think of them today are rare in this period, we have other evidence of life. For example, life has a habit of 'preferentially' uptaking certain isotopes of carbon, meaning that life leaves a so called isotopic signature in the geological record. These 'signatures' are not direct evidence and are known as 'proxies'. So essentially we have no evidence of a civilization other than ours existing anywhere in Earth's history, and in fact life itself is pretty boring before about 540 million years ago. 

Circles! Well, some of them, anyway. You can plot any azimuthal projection in polar coordinates, where the radius is a function of the angular distance from the center point. So where two points' angular distances are the same, their radii are the same, and the projection of any locus of constant angular distance from the center point is a circle, if it appears at all. Since you said that the tangent point is a pole, that means that parallels (lines of constant latitude) are those lines of constant angular distance. Ergo, Northern Hemisphere parallels appear as circles. 

(Source:Wikimedia Commons) This is the Matterhorn in the Alps on the Swiss-Italian border. The word horn is used in glacial geomorphology to refer to a mountain peak that has been ground by glaciers on many sides to create a "pyramidal peak" with sheer, faceted sides. During the Pleistocene ice ages, the Alps were covered in an ice sheet much like Antarctica is today, and undoubtedly at some point the tip of the Matterhorn poked through the top of the ice, looking very similar to the mountain in your picture. 

(Wikimedia Commons) Since the Gnomonic projection can show only a single hemisphere, the Equator and parallels in the Southern hemisphere can't appear at all -- they would be an infinite distance from the center point. The polar orientation of the projection even takes away complications resulting from the earth's not being a perfect sphere -- the radius formula changes a little, but the equal results from the same input remain. 

As Pont says, there's little evidence that the magnetic field has no observable evidence on the long term climate of earth, there was a recent study which drew a link between the solar wind strength and the frequency of lightning storms. Given that the amount of incoming charged particles from the solar wind that make it into the atmosphere is dependent on the strength of the magnetic field. This is however short term weather not climate, however it does show that the strength of the magnetic field does have an effect on the atmospheric systems, albeit not in the long run.

This paper here goes into some detail about how Mars' experiences its own form of 'ice ages' on a quasi periodic basis driven by the wobbling of its axis. The main mechanism outlined is that the stability of water ice on the surface increases with increased obliquity. This is in contrast to Earth when at high obliquity there is increased polar summer insolation leading to metling. What is the difference? On a more discussion based addition to the question, could factors such as ice albedo and other feedback loops play a similar role in Mars' ice ages that they do in Earth's ice ages? I have also asked this at the Astronomy stack exchange here 

(Source: Steven Dutch, University of Wisconsin Green Bay) $URL$ Wisconsin has late Archaen ("Penokean" craton) rocks and the same lack of later rocks as Minnesota. Wisconsin has a field-trip planning site with an interactive outcrop map at this link. If you could get access to the Black Hills outcrops (uplifted bits of the "Wyoming" craton), you might be able to approximate what tou want with a trip east through South Dakota, starting in the Black Hills. I haven't found an image of South Dakota geology appropriate for embedding, but Here is a link to a large, detailed PDF of South Dakota geology, and here is another link to an interactive site with generalized SD geology. 

(Source: Wikimedia commons) Minnesota has early Archaen ("Superior" craton) rocks and a whole succession of Paleozoic. It has some Cretaceous rocks but lacks other Mesozoic/Cenozoic bedrock. North Dakota has some Jurassic age rocks in its northeastern corner. 

The 5 factors you mention are not nearly as important to the effect you're asking about as another, more fundamental factor: time. If you've read my answer to this other question, you should understand that all of the factors you mention would create temperature differences at different latitudes whether the Earth is tilted on its axis or not. But because the Earth's axis is tilted, at some parts of the year the regions of the Earth tilted towards the Sun (in "summer") receive sunlight a greater proportion of the day than the regions pointed away (in "winter"). Not only that, because of the more direct angle of the Sun the factors you list mean that the regions in "summer" are heated better during the day than the regions in "winter". And this adds up over all the days of summer or winter until the Earth's orbit reorients the axis relative to the Sun. Or even more succinctly, summer is hotter because the Sun is higher in the sky for more of the day.
