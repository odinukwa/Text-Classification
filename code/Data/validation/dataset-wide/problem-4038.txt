As a prototype example of ergodic diffusion, consider a real valued Ornstein Uhlenbeck process of the form $$ d X_t = -\alpha X_t d t + \sigma d W_t, \quad X_0 = x $$ where $\alpha, \sigma > 0$ are constant and $W$ is a real valued Wiener process. I am trying to get some help to clarify the connection between the relaxation time $\tau$ related to the convergence to the invariant probability measure and the first eigenvalue of the generator $$ - A = \frac{\sigma^2}{2} \partial_{xx} - \alpha x \partial_x $$ We consider the minus sign to have a positive spectrum. I have not been able identify a proper reference but this connection is known for a class of ergodic processes. Let me do some calculations to see what's going on. First, on one hand, a quick check tells us that $X_t$ has a gaussian density that is : $$ p_{t,x}(y) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi} \Sigma_t} \exp \left ( - \frac{1}{2} \left (\frac{y-m_t(x)}{\Sigma_t} \right )^2 \right ) $$ where $$ m_t(x) = \exp(-\alpha t) x \quad \mbox{and} \quad \Sigma_t^2 = \frac{\sigma^2}{2\alpha} (1-\exp(-2 \alpha t )) $$ and therefore $$ \lim_{t \to \infty} p_{t,x}(y) = \frac{1}{\sigma} \sqrt{\frac{\alpha}{\pi}} \exp \left ( - \alpha \left (\frac{y}{\sigma} \right )^2 \right ). $$ Next using the function $$ \sqrt{2 \pi} F(\xi,\eta) \triangleq \frac{1}{\xi} \exp \left ( -\frac{1}{2} \left ( \frac{\eta}{\xi} \right )^2 \right ) $$ and when $t$ is large we have $$ p_{t,x}(y) - p(y) \approx F_\xi \left ( \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{2 \alpha}}, y \right ) \left ( \Sigma_t - \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{2\alpha}} \right ) + F_\eta \left ( \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{2 \alpha}}, y \right ) m_t(x) $$ which yields $$ \lim_{t \to \infty} - \frac{1}{t} \log( |p_{t,x}(y) - p(y)| ) = \frac{1}{\alpha}. $$ Comment : I am somehow surprised that $\sigma$ does not affect this relaxation time. As explained in $URL$ the simplest theoretical description of relaxation as function of time t is an exponential law $\exp \left (-\frac{t}{\tau} \right )$. On the other hand, taking $w(x) = x$, we clearly see that $$ A w = \alpha w, $$ in other words, $\alpha$ is an eigenvalue (the first one, we call it $\lambda_1$) for $A$ and it is related to the eigenvector $w$. We finally observe that the first eigenvalue of $A$ is the inverse of the time of relaxation for $p_{x,t}$, concisely $$ \fbox{$\lambda_1 \tau = 1$}. $$ question : What is the deep reason for such a connection between $\tau$ and $\lambda_1$? 

Let $M^{2n}$ be a symplectic manifold and let $M^{2n-2}$ be a symplectic submanifold. How to construct a non-trivial Hamiltonian $S^1$-action on $M^{2n-2}$ on a small neighborhood of $M^{2n-2}$, that would fix $M^{2n-2}$? (I think I saw a reference to this statement in some book, but can not find it now.) 

I finally found an exposition of Bezout's theorem that I find good :) . This is by Eduard Looijenga in his course "Algebraic geometry 1": $URL$ There is no magic of course, the proof comes after 70 pages of text. And I guess that the proof is similar to the one given in the first chapter of Hartshorne. But there is a clear (and very strong) advantage (for me): I can understand everything written in the course of Looijenga. I would advise it to and learner as myself :) 

The notion of orbifold is quite well established by now. I would like to ask how one should call a point of an orbifold with non-trivial stabilizer? Should one call this a singular point? Of something else? For some reason, I was not able to find any text that fixes this innocent bit of terminology concerning orbifolds. Comment. I would like to stress, that I want to know how to call A point (i.e. one point) that has a non-trivial stabilizer. Indeed, as Ryan says in his comment, there is some terminology to define the union of all points with non-trivial stabilizer, but this is not what I am looking for (for example, in algebraic geometry there is a canonical way to call a point that is not smooth, it is called a singular point) 

Let me start with some simple background. Consider the heat equation : $ \frac{\partial p}{ \partial t} = \frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial y^2} \quad \mbox{in} \quad \mathbb{R}\times (0,\infty), \quad p(y,0) = \delta_0(y). $ It is well known that it is the Fokker-Planck equation of a standard Wiener process $y_t$ in $\mathbb{R}$ and $p(y,t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi t}} \exp(-\frac{y^2}{2t})$ is the probability that the particle is at position $y$ at time $t$. In discrete setting, if we consider a two-dimensional rectangular lattice: comprising the sites $ \{ (j\Delta y, n\Delta t), j \in \mathbb{Z}, n \in \mathbb{N}\} $ for a given spacing $\Delta y>0$ and time duration $\Delta t >0$, then it is well known that the following finite difference scheme discretizes the heat equation: $ \frac{p_j^{n+1}-p_j^n}{ \Delta t} = \frac{D}{2} \frac{p_{j+1}^n - 2 p_{j}^n + p_{j-1}^n}{(\Delta y)^2} \quad \mbox{in} \quad \mathbb{Z}\times \mathbb{N}, \quad p^0(y) = \delta_0(y), \quad D := \frac{(\Delta y)^2}{ \Delta t} $ and it can be interpreted as the Fokker-Planck equation of a random walker satisfying $y^{n+1} = y^n + \Delta y \xi^n$ with $y^0 =0$ and $\{ \xi^n, n \geq 0 \}$ is a sequence of i.i.d satisfying $\mathbb{P} (\xi = \pm 1) = \frac{1}{2}$. Here $p_j^n$ is the probability that the random walker is at position $j \Delta y$ at time $n \Delta t$. $\star$ My question concerns the identification of the random walker for the simplest Langevin equation. $\star$ Here, we consider the simplest Langevin process $(\int_0^t y_s d s, y_t)$ and $p(x,y,t)$ ( which can be easily computed) : the probability that the particle is at position $x,y$ at time $t$. Here, the Fokker-Planck equation is: $ \frac{\partial p}{ \partial t} = \frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial y^2} - y \frac{\partial p}{\partial x} \quad \mbox{in} \quad \mathbb{R}^2 \times (0,\infty), \quad p(x,y,0) = \delta_0(x,y). $ Then, similarly to what was done before, if we consider a three-dimensional rectangular lattice: comprising the sites $ \{ (i\Delta x, j \Delta y, n\Delta t), (i,j) \in \mathbb{Z}^2, n \in \mathbb{N}\} $ for given spacings $\Delta y, \Delta x>0$ and time duration $\Delta t >0$, then it is well known that the following finite difference scheme discretizes equation above: $ \frac{p_{i,j}^{n+1}-p_{i,j}^n}{ \Delta t} = \frac{D}{2} \frac{p_{i,j+1}^n - 2 p_{i,j}^n + p_{i,j-1}^n}{(\Delta y)^2} - j \Delta y \frac{p_{i,j}^n - p_{i-1,j}^n}{\Delta x} \mathbf{1}_{(j < 0)} - j \Delta y \frac{p_{i+1,j}^n - p_{i,j}^n}{\Delta x} \mathbf{1}_{(j > 0)} \quad \mbox{in} \quad \mathbb{Z}^2 \times \mathbb{N}, \quad p^0(x,y) = \delta_0(x,y). $ question Is it possible to identify an underlying random walker? I would like to interpret the equation above as a Fokker-Planck in a discrete context. thanks. 

Consider the Grassmanian $G(k,n)$ ($k\le \frac{n}{2}$) and take its Plucker embedding. Consider now the space of all normal rational curves of degree $k$, contained in the Plucker embedding of the Grassmanian. Finally, take the closure of this space. I would like to know if this closure has some nice description. Example. The Grassmanian $G(2,4)$ is a quadric $Q$ in $\mathbb P^5$. A normal curve of degree two in this quadric is just the intersection of $Q$ with a $\mathbb P^2$. So the corresponding space in this case is $G(3,6)$. 

Let $M$ is a smooth compact manifold with an $S^1$-action with isolated fixed points. Suppose the representation of $S^1$ at tangent spaces at all fixed points is known. Can one then find all Pontryagin numbers of the manifold? I would be grateful for some nice reference on this topic. For four-manifolds such a formula for $p_1$ exists but don't know if it exists for higher dimensions. Indeed, $p_1=3\tau$, where $\tau$ is the signature, and the signature can be calculated by proposition 6.18 here $URL$ 

Is it possible to construct a smooth action of $S^1\times S^1$ on $S^{2n+1}$ ($n\ge 2$) such that no point on $S^{2n+1}$ has an infinite stabilizer? Note that if such an action exists, it can not be linear. 

Suppose $M$ is a connected smooth manifold with a smooth $S^1$-action that fixes a point in $M$. Let $X$ be a $K(\pi,1)$-space and let $\varphi: M\to X$ be a continuous map. Question. How to prove that $\varphi$ can be homotoped to a map $\varphi': M\to X$ that sends each orbit of the $S^1$ action to a point in $X$? I would be grateful for a short proof or a reference. Remark. I can prove the statement when $X$ is a negatively curved manifold, but I am confident that the statement holds as well when $X$ is $K(\pi,1)$. 

Let $K$ be a field of characteristic zero and $X_K$ a smooth projective curve on $K$. Denote by $\bar{K}$ the algebraic closure of $K$ and $X_{\bar{K}}$ the base change of $X_K$ to $\bar{K}$. Under the natural morphism from $X_{\bar{K}} \to X_K$, we have an induced morphism $\mbox{Pic}^0(X_K) \to \mbox{Pic}^0(X_{\bar{K}})$. Is this morphism surjective? If not true in general, is there any known condition on $K$ under which this holds true? 

Let $C$ be a smooth, projective, geometrically irreducible curve of genus at least $2$ over a complete discrete valued field $F$ of characteristic zero (not necessarily algebraically closed). Let $R$ be the ring of integers of $F$. Assume that the residue field of $R$ is algebraically closed. Does there exist a model of $C$ over $R$ such that the special fiber is irreducible with at worst nodal singularities? I know that by Deligne-Mumford, there always exists a semi-stable model, which only guarentees a reducible curve with at worst nodal singularities, but I am asking if we can do better? 

This is a continuation of a question asked by me previously with some added hypothesis. Let $X, Y$ be irreducible projective schemes over $\mathbb{C}$, $W \subset X \times Y$ a closed irreducible subscheme. Suppose that the natural projection map $pr_2:W \to Y$ is surjective on the underlying topological spaces, and every fiber is reduced. Note that for all $x \in W$, there is a natural map of tangent spaces $\phi_x:T_{W,x} \to T_{Y,pr_2(x)}$. If there is a point $y \in Y$ such that the $\mathbb{C}$-vector space generated by the union $\cup_{x \in pr_2^{-1}(y)} \phi_x(T_{W,x})$ does not coincide with $T_{Y,y}$, does this mean that $Y$ is nonreduced at the point $y$? 

If we consider a nice Ornstein Uhlenbeck process $d x (t) = - \gamma x(t) dt + \sigma d w (t)$ with $x(0) = x_0 \in (-L,L)$. Here $\gamma, \sigma$ are positive constant and $w(t)$ is a Wiener process. Is the law of $\tau = \inf \{ t>0, |x(t)| = L \}$ the first hitting time of $\pm L$ by $x(t)$ known explicitly when $x_0 \neq 0$? When $x_0 = 0$, it is not a big issue. Sorry if the solution is straightforward but it isn't clear to me. Thanks for help. m. 

Let $\{ X_t, t \geq 0 \}$ be a $\mathbb{R}^d$-valued stochastic process on a probability space $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P})$. Assumption 

Let $W(t)$ be a standard brownian motion in $E \triangleq \mathbb{R}^d$. The transition probability from a state $x \in E$ at time $t$ to a state $y \in E$ at time $T$ is $$ p(x,t;y,T) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi (T-t)}^d} \exp \left ( -\frac{1}{2} \frac{\|x-y \|^2}{T-t}\right ). $$ Using the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation, it is clear that for all $n \geq 0$ and for all finite sequence of states $x_0 = x, x_1, ... , x_n, x_{n+1} = y$ and $t_0 = t < t_1 < ... < t_n < t_{n+1} = T$, we have $$ p(x,t;y,T) = \int_{E^n} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}^{nd}} \exp \left ( -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=0}^{n} \frac{\|x_{i+1}-x_i \|^2}{t_{i+1}-t_i}\right ) \prod_{i=1}^n \frac{d x_i}{\sqrt{t_{i+1}-t_i}^d}. $$ I am not so sure that the limit as $n \to \infty$ makes sense in the right hand side above but I believe that it can be interpreted in terms of the Wiener measure on $\mathcal{C}([0,\infty);E)$ and $$ C(x,t;y,T) \triangleq \{ \omega \in \mathcal{C}([0,\infty);E) \: | \: w(t) = x, \: w(T) = y \}. $$ (if no mistake) how to interpret $p(x,t;y,T)$ in terms of $\mu$ and $C(x,t;y,T))$? 

Let $K$ be a field of characteristic $0$, $X_K$ a smooth projective curve over $K$. Denote by $\bar{K}$ the algebraic closure of $K$. The base change morphism $X_{\bar{K}} \to X_K$, induces via the pull-back map, a morphism of the Picard groups, $\mbox{Pic}(X_K) \to \mbox{Pic}(X_{\bar{K}})$. Is this map injective? If not true in general, is there a known condition on $K$ under which this holds true? 

Let $f:X \to Y$ be a proper, flat morphism of projective scheme and $Y$ is an irreducible, non-singular surface. Assume further that there exists a Zariski open subset $U$ of $Y$ whose complement is of codimension $2$ such that the total space $f^{-1}(U)$ is non-singular and such that $f:f^{-1}(U) \to U$ has geometrically irreducible fibers. Denote by $\eta$ the generic point of $Y$. Suppose that there exists a morphism from $\eta$ to the generic fiber $X_{\eta}$. Then, does there exist a morphism $s:Y \to X$ such that $f \circ s$ is identity on $Y$? EDIT: Assumptions as above. Then, does there exist a rational section of $f$? 

Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field of positive characteristic and $f:X \to S$ be a smooth, flat, projective morphism between noetherian $k$-schemes. Assume that $S$ is a non-singular quasi-projective variety. Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a locally free sheaf on $X$. Fix a polarization $L$ on $X$ and a Hilbert polynomial $P$. Denote by $\mathrm{Quot}_{X/\mathcal{F}/S}^P$ the relative Quot-scheme parametrizing coherent quotients of $\mathcal{F}$ with Hilbert polynomial $P$. There exists a natural morphism $\pi:\mathrm{Quot}_{X/\mathcal{F}/S}^P \to S$ and for each point $x \in \mathrm{Quot}_{X/\mathcal{F}/S}^P$, there exists an induced map between tangent spaces $T_x\pi:T_x\mathrm{Quot}_{X/\mathcal{F}/S}^P \to T_{\pi(x)}S$. Is it true that for a general (closed) $x \in \mathrm{Quot}_{X/\mathcal{F}/S}^P$, we have $\dim \mathrm{Im}(\pi) \le \mathrm{rk}(T_x\pi)$? Any hint/reference on this topic will be very welcome. N.B. If it helps, one can assume that $X$ is of the form $C \times S$, for a non-singular curve $C$ over $k$ of genus at least $2$ and $f$ is projection onto the second coordinate. 

Edited (this question contains two versions of a similar question) Is there some finitely presented group $G$ generated by $g_1,...,g_n$ such that there is an element $g\in G$ expressed as a finite word in $g_i$'s so that it is impossible to prove neither $g=1$ nor $g\ne 1$? Is such a group $G$ exists, what would be a relatively simple example? Adjusted question. Is there $G,g$ so that $g\ne 1$ in $G$ but is it impossible to prove this in finite time? 

Let $X$ be a smooth complex projective variety with an ample line bundle $L$, and let $D\subset X$ be a smooth divisor. Suppose in an analytic neighborhood $U$ of $D$ there is a Kahler form $\omega$ such that the class of $\omega|_D$ in $H^{1,1}(D)$ equals $c_1(L)$. How to prove that there exists an even smaller analytic neighborhood $U'\subset U$ of $D$ such that $\omega$ can be extended from $U'$ to a Kahler form on whole $X$? 

Take a convex polyhedron $P$ in $\mathbb R^3$ and remove all the faces, i.e. leave only the edges. Call this graph $E$. Let us now try to continuously deform $E$ in $\mathbb R^3$ so that all the edges of $E$ keep their length and remain straight (like metal sticks), but allow the change of angles between the edges. Question. Is it true that $E$ admits non-trivial deformations (not globally isomteric) if at least one face of $P$ is not a triangle? Note that if all the faces of $P$ are triangles it is not deformable by Cauchy's rigidity theorem: $URL$
