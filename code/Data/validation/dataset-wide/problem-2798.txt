I would take the position that they are "conditionally" true, unless/until some underlying or assumed condition is false. Using your example, most people familiar with matches, would not strike a wet match. They would wait until it dries, before striking it. Therefore, the "reality" statement should be S & (dry & O2 & T & etc.) > L. This statement is true, as long as all underlying conditions are true. In "normal" conversations, where neither side has anything to gain (or loose), the underlying conditions have the highest provability of being true. The more a side has to gain(or loose), the more likely one or more of the conditionals is false. So, the truth or falsity of utterances, depends on the "degree of manipulation" of the conditionals. 

In a "round-about way" you are saying the same thing (using circular logic). Let me rephrase: 1. It is possible that God Exists, (an assumption) 4. Therefore, God exists. (an unfounded assertion). In other words, just because something is possible, does not necessarily make it so! 

The obvious logical answer would be to negate the expression, identical, (ie. not identical). Another possibility is, "is different" (ie. A is different from B). 

One can always find "complicated" answers to everything. However, your teacher's answer is logically correct if we restrain to a "simplistic (localized)" scenario. I believe that what your teacher is trying to show, is that since both dualist and physicalists agree on the existence of the body, then no additional proof is required by either side. However, for additional matters in which they are in disagreement, the burden of proof will belong to whichever side wants to make additional claims. Physicalists are finished with their claims, but since dualists want to add the claim that "there exists a soul," then it is their burden to provide the proof of it. 

I believe that the source of the "problem," is the third sentence. "to restore unpredictability, the coin must be engineered to ideal equilibrium and resistance." in which case we are left with a "faceless coin." This conclusion is totally wrong! The only requirement is for the coin to be balanced with respect to a plane parallel to the face of the coin and passing through the c.g. of the coin. This means we can put indentations on each face different but equivalent. For example, I would make a square indentation on one side of the coin, and 4 (1/4 size) indentations on the other side. This way the "balance" is not affected and the faces are distinguishable. 

From my perspective, the only rights animals and plants have, are those provided by their "owners." If they are "wild," then it's the rights provided by the government (and the laws). On their own, I only see their right to fight and defend themselves (and/or other members of their group) to the best of their ability against all predators. If they are owned by somebody, then it is the owner's responsibility to provide any rights they want for them. From this perspective, the questions of "compatibility" and "equal consideration" are indeterminable/irrelevant, as animals and plants, on their own, have no/minimum rights. 

The phrase as stated is contradictory. However, as "commonly" understood, it means to "not trust blindly" because humans are fallible and unpredictable. In other words, don't trust 100%. The "degree of trust" varies depending on the "reputation" of the person making the statement. For example, Sue might get a rating of 80%, while Bob might get a rating of 40%. If this is the case, you would be justified in trusting Sue more than Bob, but if you need 100% certainty, you have to verify. 

There is a big difference between surviving and "living." Our generosity should not go beyond providing the minimum for individual survival. The individual's desire to "live" (not just survive) would then be the motivation for the individual to not refuse to use his/her talents/skills to provide a "life" for him/herself. I believe that a society with this type of philosophy would be able to keep to a minimum the number of individuals causing this type of "problem" to the society. 

I can only speak for myself. To me God is unmeasurable energy, capable of thought and action. Able to create anything but restraining Himself. Acting only when necessary and using humans as much as possible to achieve His plan. 

Even leaving semantics out of this question, the way you have "built" the question, leaves only one possible answer. Yes, a decision maker that subscribes to the stipulated principles, would decide against human abortion, (which is not really a decision, since there is no choice)! 

I disagree that B is true! I would say that B is indeterminate, ambiguous, or undetermined, but I would never accept that B is true. Using the OP statement, "if pigs could fly, then anything is possible," then I could say, if pigs could fly, then the earth is flat; if pigs could fly, then the universe will stop expanding; if pigs could fly, then the human race will disappear before you read this; etc. In other words, I can use this to prove anything is true, and jet, we know the previous statements are false. 

Is existence a feature of life? No. Can a stone exist without life to recognize it? Yes. Before humans existed, the Universe existed. Therefore, human existence (intelligence) is not required for anything to exist. 

Just like there is a "critical mass" required to have a nuclear bomb, there is a "critical number of neurons" required for an organism to be conscious (self-aware). although the minimum number has not been established, I would estimate the number should be greater than a million. Based on this, a rock has no consciousness because it has zero neurons. Also, one-cell organisms and up to viruses, have no consciousness, because they don't have enough neurons. 

My justification for the use of logic is that logic allows us to eliminate (reduce) "erroneous paths" to truth. Thereby allowing us to get as close as it is possible, to the truth. My justification is a conclusion, not an inference, therefore it is not circular. 

I believe that the "golden rule" was invented to protect the the poor, lame, weak, ignorant, stupid, retarded, incapacitated, etc. etc. from the "more" rich, healthy, strong, knowledgeable, intelligent, capable, etc. members of their society/group. This was necessary because all the members, are in fact, not created equal. Therefore, without the golden rule (and the laws), some of the more "capable" members would take advantage of the less capable members. There are at least two ways we should treat those that don't follow the golden rule: 1)try to teach them the "costs" of not following the rule, and the "benefits" of doing so, 2) take whatever steps are necessary, to "protect" those that the more capable members would harm. 

It is possible to say what ever you want, but the reality is a little more complicated that your example. Let's say that the 1000 units produced sell at $1 each, they make $1000, pay $500, reinvest $100 in a machine. Net profit from this transaction = $400. If you don't fire the workers, you now produce 2000 units. At this level of supply, the units sell for $0.50 each, they still make only $1000, if they pay $500 and don't reinvest, they only make $500 profit. Hopefully this oversimplified example is useful. 

Graham Oppy's statement is correct. Without "countable additivity," the result of an arithmatic sum of an infinite series would not be the limit(the total) of the partial sums. The reason is that we would not be able to add the partial sums! 

Even though you are using different terminology, you are essentially asking what has been asked before: 1 - What created the universe (everything)? 2 - What created the creator of the universe? You also state that "simple logic dictates that since something can not come out of nothing, it requires something to exist, for anything to come into being/exist." If you believe in a "supreme being," the answers are very simple. 1 - The supreme being created the universe (everything). 2 - The supreme being always existed (with no beginning and no end). This is the one and only exception to the "simple logic." If you don't, then there is a "bigger" universe that always existed and our universe is only a small part of it. So, 1 - our universe came out of the bigger universe, and 2 - the "bigger" universe has always existed. 

Addressing the QM question: No, QM's randomness does not contradict religion. Nor does it create a theistic issue. God knew the "best" method of creating a universe - and He used it! He knew that the "best" universe is obtained when He "interferes" the least with it. In keeping with this, all He did, was provide an unimaginable amount of energy and a few "assembly/interaction" rules. The creation of the Universe - as it is (QM's randomness included), was intentional! 

Although I have limited experience, I have come to the conclusion that if you learn logic, and are good at it, you will be able to apply it to law with no difficulty, that's because logic is used to write the (most?) laws. 

If I were interested in discrediting the Bible (or any other document), circular logic would be the least/last argument I would use. The reason for this is that circular logic refers mostly to the person using it, not the document. Instead, would look for contradictions, different explanations for the same topic, sequential and/or logic errors, etc.. Since these are all part of the same document, they would be strong arguments against the document, thereby discrediting its validity. If "circular logic" were to be found in the Bible, it would discredit It very little, if at all. 

I am of the opinion that the policy, as it stands, is correct. The reason is that as worded, it is more "strict/exclusive" than asking if you had "risky" sexual behavior or if you have tested positive for HIV. Since the definition of "risky" is open to interpretation, what one considers NOT risky, may actually be. Also, not testing positive, does NOT mean that you are not currently carrying the HIV virus. By being so strict (not discriminatory), the chance of contaminating the blood banks is as close to zero as possible. The only exception to the policy would be if a "severe" shortage of blood develops such that some persons would die if they don't get a blood transfusion. In this case, the risk of receiving blood that might be contaminated with HIV, would be acceptable. 

Maybe I am very naive, but I know I am not living in a simulation. My evidence is my free will! I interact with other people and see that they also have free will. Therefore, I conclude that we are not living in a simulation. I am aware of the controversy relating to free will, but from my point of view, there is no controversy. 

The very definition of non observable tells you that you can't know if something non observable exists! However, we have the capabilities of deduction, induction, and logic. With these capabilities, we are able to infer the existence of "something" by its effects. Lets say we detect some "effect," then we try to find its cause. If we are able to detect some cause, then we can confidently say that the "cause" exists. If we are unable to find a cause, we can still infer that something must exist that caused the effect, even though it is - non observable. 

Our physical world, is not an abstract mathematical structure. It existed for a long time before mathematics was ever invented! It just so happens that mathematics can be used by us (humans) to understand (make sense of) some portions of it. Mathematics is only a "tool" created by (inside) our imagination. How can something inside our brain (thoughts) "create" physical matter? There's no way! 

Your question consists of two parts, 1) "What defines lack of evidence"?, and 2) "is it irrational to believe in something without evidence"? In order to answer the first part, we must recognize that there are different amounts/types of "evidence" that result in different "degrees" of certainty. There is, 1 - no evidence, 2 - preponderance of the evidence, 3- beyond a reasonable doubt, and 4 - absolute certainty. For some people, any degree other than 4, would constitute "lack of evidence" for others, only degree 1, would. The answer to the second part then, depends on the mentality of the person providing the answer. For a person that requires only degree 1, there are 3 additional degrees that "provide evidence," therefore it would not be irrational to believe in the item in question. whereas, for a person that requires degree 4, it would be irrational to believe in something supported by the lesser evidence provided by degrees 2 & 3. 

Although your definition meets several of the requirements/properties of a "soul," I think it is inadequate. I consider your definition a subset of the total properties because, at the very least, it leaves out the internal properties of a soul. A closer definition would be, the sum total of the instinctive and learned information a being has gained/obtained trough out its life. This cover both, the external influences and internal properties of "soul."
