I wouldn't say that there is disagreement in the translation. They just translate it or interpret it differently to explain the same thing. I would say this is more a question about the way of passing wisdom to listeners. They translated/interpreted it differently so to lead their listeners to the realization of the truth. Nonetheless, bot translations/interpretations lead the listener to the same goal: cessation of suffering. 

Yes. Kamma is ended only when/while there's no contact. And when does contact cease completely? In Nibanna. Going into the deepest Jhana, does not cease contact completely. Think about it ... what if somebody punches you in the face while being in Jhana? What if your body develops a disease while being in Jhana? As you can see, due to your kamma not being completely extinguished, you bear fruits of this kamma, even if being in perfect Jhana. The only way to extinguish your kamma is by ending ignorance and "dying" one last more time, thus entering Nibanna. 

The state of Nibbana is neither "not existing at all in any way", nor "existing in all ways". It is neither "nonexistence with benefits", nor "existence with benefits". 

Hopefully, the Pali Canon is vast enough, so it's easy to see through this facade of lies. So, what would be the secular interpretation for the Assu Sutta and the Mata Sutta? You already know the answer. Just use your imagination. Remember, the interpretation given is delusional, but it seems legit, because he/she distorts reality in order to conform it with his/her "good looking self" which is just a mask for his/her "wounded self". The more the wounded self hurts, the more the interpretation will be delusional, or out of place, or just too complicated to comprehend for us poor mundane beings. An uninstructed mind, not very well versed in the Dhamma, can quickly fall for such elaborate lies. But an instructed mind, with an open mind, can't fall for it and will see through the lies by looking at the whole picture, not merely at the details that the narcissist points to. That's his/her game: he/she doesn't want you to see the whole picture, because if you see it, his/her mask would fall. So, what would be the secular interpretation for the Assu Sutta and the Mata Sutta? I'll try to answer this question. Thinking about it, it's not an easy task, but I'll try: 

Source: $URL$ Siding to one of these two extremes ("self exists" and/or "self does not exist") is not in accordance to the Dhamma and is an indication of a wounded self (suffering). (Please read until the end as it will become clear to you why I'm writing all this) When self is wounded and this wound can't be healed by eradicating ignorance (with realization of anatta), there are only two options to ease this suffering: 

Suppose somebody strongly believes in no post-mortem rebirth and strongly denies the possibility of the existence of rebirth. Is such a belief/view a result of craving for views regarding rebirth? Is it possible to attain Nirvana with such a belief/view? Does an arahat strongly believe in no post-mortem rebirth and strongly deny the possibility of the existence of rebirth?

You need to calm your mind. Then you need to meditate and calm your mind even more. Then you need to do the above steps. Then you need to do some other steps. Etc. ... until you realize the truth yourself. Realization comes through meditation. The calmer your mind is, the easier it will be. 

You should answer your question yourself. Wisdom gained through experience is the right path to liberation. If you want to know what is the conditioned reality of thoughts, do this: 

From non-celibacy arises suffering. How could that be? From non-celibacy arises jealousy, fear, hatred, tension and all the worries and consequences that arise from lust. 

Suppose a father is abusing his 3 year old child. As a consequence, the child is suffering. Who is the cause of the child's suffering? 

While thinking how to answer your question, I experience presence of self, which I know is no self ... a fabrication ... not truth. When I completely stopped thinking, there was no experience of presence of self. 

There are truths that are deep and hard to understand. What are these truths? You are everywhere. You are everything. You are deathless. You are neither perfection, nor imperfection, nor anything in between. That's pure bliss. That's the "real you". In order to be this "real you", your future "I"ies must cease to become. In complete cessation of becoming, future "I"ies will not be born. When "I" is not born, this "real you" remains. And what is it that remains? Undefined is the answer. As soon as you give an answer, "I" arises and this "real you" becomes tainted with "I". And what is the "I"? It's limited with a body. It's limited in space. It's limited with death. It's limited with imperfections. That's the "I". It's because of these truths that your current "I" should strive to realize these truths so that no future "I"ies will ever arise. 

Even if a being would view stealing as an illusion, stealing could still occur because of left ignorance in that being. What left ignorance? Ignorance of the fact that his self exists. Ignorant of the fact his self exist, he has the view that his self does not exist, so he thinks his self could not be hurt, so he decides to steal and steps on a path with a greater potential for future suffering. Ignorance of the fact that self of other beings does not exist. Ignorant of the fact that the self of other beings does not exist, he has the view that self of other beings exists, he sees that these beings see stealing as reality, not an illusion, thus he changes his view according to their view (self exists, thus stealing is real) thinking it is right view, and decides to steal and steps on a path with a greater potential for future suffering. It's this ignorance of not knowing reality as it really is that is creating potential for stealing to occur and all kinds of suffering:
