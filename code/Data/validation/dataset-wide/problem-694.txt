Most of the beginner, inexpensive models you will likely be looking will require little maintenance (other than normal cleaning and checking your cleat bolts) and will likely last for years before they die. As mentioned elsewhere shimano SPD style is a good choice for this because they are market saturated, parts (like replacement cleats when one falls off) are readily available and they are common. If you start looking into a more expensive set of pedals, this may change. I run eggbeaters on all my bikes (road and MTB!) and have at least one pedal set that although I initially paid several hundred dollars for, has been rebuilt twice (with inexpensive kits from the company) and still works just as well over a decade later. Some companies consider even their most expensive pedals disposable, while others will sell rebuild kits and parts for theirs rather than just suggesting a new set. 

Having ridden both on a lot of ice for years, I'll answer that most of the fatbikes I have ridden tend to be more stable on ice than a MTB. The wider your tires are (and at lower pressure) the less likely that the wheel will slip (side to side) easily. Riding on snow and ice are very separate things. Snow is actually very easy to ride provided it is either (semi)packed or not deep. Fatbikes were to some extend perfected by snow riders since the main advantage they provide is not "punching through" packed snow on trails as easily as a narrower tired bike. Ice can be very difficult to nearly impossible to ride on. Flat ice (like a skating rink) can be ridden across in shorter sections with only good technique. By maintaining balance and not turning or pedaling in a sloppy manner, flat ice can be travelled. Sloped ice (like overflow or an icy hill) requires studs; pretty much end of story. There are many companies out there producing high quality (and some low quality) studded bicycle tires. I have a narrower set (3.8 inches) I use on my fatbike for commuting or riding trails with longer overflow sections. 

The answer is yes. That was a complaint about the setup from many riders that often your would accidentally shift while trying to break. The problem is worse when you are trying to brake while the front end is jumping all over the place. I had a friend with the setup on a Kona Stinky Primo back in the day and I tried it on one shuttle run. I decided it definitely was not for me. I was told you can get used to it enough that the instance of accidental shifts is close to zero, but I am not sure I bought into that theory. 

Putting a longer travel fork on a bike not designed for it will alter the geometry of the bike, and usually the handling. Depending on the amount of change, it might be barely noticeable, or it could also appreciably degrade the ability of the bike to be ridden. You could put a 200mm travel fork on a road frame, but the resulting geometry would render the bike unfit for anything serious. The change you are talking about will likely result in a rideable but slightly awkward ride. It's unlikely you'll snap your frame (highly unlikely). However, it's far more likely that if you use the front fork (a 200mm dual crown monster) to it's full potential, you blow out/prematurely wear the rear shock which is not designed for that kind of abuse. Considering what a fork like that (or a replacement rear shock) costs, you'd probably be better off selling that bike as is and trying to by a bike more suited to the type of riding you are planning. 

Power washing will clean your bike, followed by closely after forcing you to replace all your bearing compartments. This means your headset, bottom bracket, pedals, and wheels (hubs, freewheel or freehub). Do not powerwash your bike. At all. With all the effort it would take to properly "cover" all the bearing compartments, then had washing all those areas after, you could have just cleaned the entire bike by hand properly. 

I'd suggest you talk to the shop you took the bicycle to and find out what all the tune up entailed. Degraded shifting performance after some riding is exactly what you would expect if the cable and/or housing has been replaced (on any quality of shifter). Shifting cables are steel and will stretch after some initial use. When they do, they become "untuned" and generally require a bit of additional tension. 

Most modern bicycle components will withstand an amazing amount of variation. I do, however, recommend that you allow time for the bike to dry in between taking it out and keep the bike as free as possible from salt and grime (which will accelerate wear of your components). As background, I have had several commuter bikes that regularly go between a 70F heated building and temperatures of -40F outside. Issues WILL arise if you take a wet bike out into the cold. However, given time to dry inside and keeping everything relatively clean, I haven't ever had any major problems. 

You can make sure you don't mix and match mountain and road drivetrain parts if you haven't inspected them. Although the spline pattern is the same on both, the spline depth is not. Going with a higher grade cassette will make the problem worse (much worse). Your all titanium Dura-Ace cassette will cut through your aluminum mountain freehub body "like butter". You'll notice the issue fairly quickly since your most used individual gears will turn through the freehub body first, misaligning the shiftgates and causing noticeable issues shifting. Road cassettes most often contain a high number of individual gears and are short on carriers. The splines on a road hub are much deeper to accommodate the increased force against the splines by a single gear. Mountain cassettes tend to have largely carriers which distribute the force across the spline. Accordingly the splines on a mountain hub are less deep/tall. I learned this lesson the hard way after my Dura-Ace 10 speed cassette destroyed the freehub body (completely) of my DT Swiss 190 Ceramic Disc hub. Luckily the folks at DT Swiss sent me a new freehub body and I was back in business. 

Bicycles are generally a balance of being a complex enough machine to be efficient, but simple enough to lessen the chance of mechanical failure. What you are talking about is a fairly complex mechanical upgrade to make up for lack of riding technique (smooth pedal stroke). Such a system would add complexity and weight to any bicycle one would own, rather than simply have a rider develop skills to be carried from one bicycle to the next. Developing a smooth pedal stroke is a boon to any cyclist. What you are suggesting would actually prevent people from learning (or discourage) proper riding technique. Unlike training wheels, which offer a measure of safety while encouraging balance (when setup properly) you are proposing a mechanism to prevent proper technique and ultimately develop a alternate technique that would only work on bicycles with specialized equipment installed. 

Depending on your attentiveness while riding, the hazards in the area you ride in and a few other factors, that may be a reasonable amount of flats. I know a few commuters in my area that expect roughly a flat a week in their roughly 100 mile weekly commute. I've ridden with this particular pair of guys, however and found they have a tendency to shortcut through glass filled abandoned parking lots and the like, and they don't pick careful lines through that mess. I will say this about flats, when you change a flat, you should always figure out why/how you got the flat. If you don't, you'll just get the same flat again. Pull the tube, keep it oriented, re-inflate it and figure out where the hole(s) are. There are articles out there telling you where to look based on the placement of your tube holes and their configuration. If you are getting repeated puncture flats from objects, you may consider switching to more puncture resistant tires. Keep in mind more expensive does not mean more durable. I've bought ultralight and expensive race tires before that didn't make it 13 miles around a loop before picking up 3 punctures from gravel that wasn't even that sharp. I ended up switching to a much heavier but more puncture resistant tire that was 30% cheaper and hasn't had any punctures since. I don't race, so that works fine for me. If your awareness doesn't keep you out of glass patches and the like (or they are just unavoidable in your area, I am pointing at you Honolulu) and you get repeated puncture flats, you may also consider switching to a tubeless setup with juice in your tires to minimize the impact of these.
