I presume this is a "Hollywood" weapon, meaning the most important thing is to look cool, not to be effective. Otherwise, I'd point out that piecing has been known to be the most effective way to use a sword since before roman times. So no, you don't have to even have slicing in your combat style, quad or not. Why quad then? You could explain away this design by claiming it's a "ceremonial" weapon. 

If earth suddenly lost friction we'd all die in massive earthquakes and tsunamis as all the pent up tectonic energy everywhere is released at once. But after that we'd never have an earthquake again since now the plates are perfectly lubed. Not that we'd be around to care. Don't worry, the mud slides will give us a proper burial. 

Put the city at the bottom of it. If you want to be cautions add earthquake stabilizers and inertial dampeners to your tall buildings. 

It would finally make wind and solar a dominate source of power. One of the biggest things limiting wind and solar is they don't produce power when we need power the most. The advantage oil, coal, nuclear, and geo thermal have is they produce power on demand. Wind and solar produce when they feel like it. This means we can't use them exclusively. We use them to supplement to reduce our need on other sources when they do produce but that's all. Room temperature super conductivity would let us build stable efficient batteries. That would let us store energy and release it on demand. Sure you could also give ball bearings a run for their money but the power thing seems like the big thing. 

Fun things that can happen just because of gravity: Suppose we wanted to have a little fun with the solar system but without actually touching it. The general term for this is perturb but that's dull so let's talk about the kinds with fun names. Slingshot This gravitational effect is how voyager I and II got where they are today. This video shows the paths. I recommend you watch it with the sound off. Blech. If you know anything about conservation of energy you may be asking where the energy to fling those spacecraft around came from. Yep we slowed the planets down just to give our craft a speed boost. Doubt it'll send Jupiter hurling towards us any time soon. But we did perturb it. Just not much. Jupiter is freakin big. It works like being double bounced on a trampoline or rolling around on the same bed. You don't have to touch the other person to feel their energy. If something the size of jupiter went whizzing by the earth it could easily send us off in some direction that wouldn't be good for our health, without even touching us. Which is a shame because the movie version of this disaster would have the most boring special effects ever. No explosions. Phooey. Horseshoe orbits If somehow we're lucky enough to not get flung out of the goldilocks zone and actually remain in a stable orbit something as weird as this might start happening. A horseshoe orbit is really the slingshot effect done in a stable way. Two bodies interact gravitationally and exchange momentum. One ends up in a more energetic orbit. The other ends up in a less energetic orbit. This could really make time fly as the length of our year would suddenly change. Given enough time they run into each other again and do the swap again. Now it seems to take forever to get to christmas. What would make it worse of course is if we discovered intelligent alien life on this planet and the only message it sent was, "Does this bug you? I'm not touching you". 

If you want to get silly you could even have your bots powered (indirectly) by ethanol & bio-diesel, a whole automated farming & industry chain producing crops, processing them into fuel & delivering it to the power stations, with the power flowing back to the abandoned cities & homes the bots inhabit through the remnants of the bot maintained national grid, where they plug in to recharge. 

So other than walking on the soles of the feet (plantigrade), humanoid & clutch size, an Ostrich. Other than hole nesting (which as you point out has implications for the egg not rolling away & the necessity (or rather the lack of any) of shapes that avoid that) your criteria have no implications for egg shape (well not much worth speaking of). Typical clutch size can have some implications for the potential size of individual eggs, but not really for shape (if you only lay one egg you can put more resources in it). It's not one of your criteria but the size of the birth canal (or whatever we call the bit an egg passes through) does have implications, you're laying one egg at a time so you'll want to put as much into that one egg as you can to allow for larger better developed offspring with the best chance of survival at hatching & an oval shape will allow a bigger egg to pass through the pelvic bones. Other than that it will conform to the rounded oval structure of most eggs (simply because a sphere provides the most strength for the shell, & an oval is the closest you can get to that while allowing it to be longer than it's wide so you can have a bigger egg for the size of the pelvis). The same as many other eggs it might be a little thinner at one end so it will roll in a circle instead of rolling away (just in case it is ever out of the nest hole). The long & the short is that nature has had a long time to perfect the design & barring a very few outlying examples has chosen much the same design for almost every egg laying species eggs.. So it will be (really big surprise) egg shaped, meaning a slightly asymmetrical oval. 

All the resources, all the materials, everything you need to build a space station in the first place are basically at the bottom of a gravity well (i.e. on planets). Was that "asteroid belt" I heard you say? it's a damn long way out from the sun to that, & energy to run your station out there is going to be thin on the ground as a result, travelling out & back with the ore will take a damn long time & likely even more energy than lifting the stuff off planet. So everything you need to build, extend & maintain it has to be hauled uphill (or a very long way). In the short term there may be advantages to a space station but ultimately in the long term the cost benefits of hauling all that stuff off world every-time you have enough population increase to need to expand (or build a new station) means that long term the planet route will win every time. Whatever advantage space stations do or don't have long term it's just cheaper & more economic to drop your population at the bottom of that hill where everything they need (for expansion) is anyway. Which doesn't mean we shouldn't have space stations, we should, there are a lot of things we can do with them we can't do (or can't do as easily, or as well) on a planet & they're going to be a useful part of our toolkit, but as a housing solution for the bulk of the human race they're a non-starter. All in all even an un-terraformed planet where you have to live in a contained environment is a better solution for a growing population than a space station, at least everything needed to build new living space is close at hand there. 

Consider not folding the blades. Consider rotating one blade. You mentioned magic/technology. Let's create the world's first sword/blender. Why? Because it's fun to twist the knife. 

Same reason you build schools in third world countries. Empathy. For just pennies a day you can help earthlings free themselves from the ravages of poverty, war, and daytime talk shows. Or maybe they just want us to live long enough to see how Game of Thrones ends. 

I don't think this would devastate or invalidate the scientific method. It may well keep it from becoming popular. We live in a semi non-deterministic world now. But there is a clear distinction between the deterministic parts and non-deterministic parts. We expect a rock to be a rock. But we expect people to be moody. In a world like you describe, physics may have less to do with Newton's laws and more to do with Sigmund Freud's. If you want a rock to be a rock you may first have to spend some time listening to it talk about the day it's had. So science wouldn't be dead. But it would sure be different. If this god keeps screwing around eventually he'll get caught and a theory about him will be born. You're describing a case where he's leaving indirect evidence behind. Sometimes that's enough. We make have discovered a new 9th planet just by looking at how the orbits of other objects have been arranged. 

Sure, toss a cubical bar magnet into space and you have a "planet" with a magnetic field. The only question is how big it is. If it's big enough it'll stop being magnetic or cubical. A spinning core requires a mantle. So if you want to generate the magnetic field that way you need to be big. Now sure you could build eight three sided mountains on a sphere to form a cube but once it's big enough you need to make the mountains out of unobtainium. How it formed will require a hell of a back story. 

This can be done, but doing it with a satellite based laser is doing it the hard way. If you want to weaponise a satellite use it for what it's best at: communicating. Hire yourself a team of hackers. Give them the world's best anonymity shield. And set them to work hacking the world's toasters. Soon you are starting fires all over. That tank truck will burn nicely after it's breaking system has been reprogrammed. After the driver somehow rolls away to safety his cellphone's battery starts to burn. Sure, it's not a flashy death ray from above. But it is a death ray, from above. Burn you technophiles! Burn! Now excuse me, I'm going to go unplug my toaster. 

It might be possible. But you have to think outside a few boxes. For one thing. What makes a sun your sun? Do you HAVE to orbit it? We already do exactly this with Polaris. We just don't think of Polaris as our sun. Polaris doesn't exactly keep us warm. But why shouldn't it? Because it's fairly long way away. Any way to fix that? 

Breed you own ants. Sterilize them. And let them take over the planet. Wait a few generations and your intelligent ants will be destroyed by cheap immigrant labor. Ether that or they'll elect an orange ant with bad hair, in which case they're doomed anyway. 

This free's us of the burden of elaborate physical security. The only physical security we need is enough to keep normal people from figuring out what's going on and becoming a leak. Thus a network of safe houses to provide a non-descript place to work is our best defense. A bonus would be a combination safe that no one person knows the full combination to, would be a useful way to slow them down, provided it doesn't slow us down. So maybe it's just a prop. Misinformation can also be employed. Any of the ideas in the other answers would be a fine elaborate distraction that works even if the package isn't really there. We don't want the ninjas to even know our protection strategy.
