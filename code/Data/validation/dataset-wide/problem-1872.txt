Those aren't the words of someone that doesn't like you. Rather, they are the words of someone that thinks enough of you to suggest a path of improvement. This is a good thing. When you pass this person in the hall or see them in the elevator, smile and say hello. Make small talk: "How's your day going?" and "What did you think about the memo on x?" are good starters. You have maybe 45 seconds in an elevator, which means it'll be over fast. Do that often enough and you'll become a bit more comfortable. 

I was involved in an incident where a mid level manager screamed at me so loudly that half the floor could hear him. I was sitting at my cube (half height) and my wife had called me to ask a few questions. The manager walked up and began screaming at me to get off the phone; he dropped quite a few expletives. Quite frankly I'm not entirely sure what he was even saying due to the volume other than to get off the phone. For the record, personal calls were absolutely allowed. I calmly told my wife that I'd call her back and hung up. Everyone in the office had stopped to watch what was going on. I didn't say a word and just stood there waiting for it to end. In all honesty I was afraid the guy was about to hit me. He outweighed me by at least 100 lbs and was at least a foot taller. When he finally finished and stomped off, I went straight into the CTO's office and told him that he had a choice. Either he would terminate that manager and have him escorted off the property immediately or I would go to the police, file a report of assault then sue the company into oblivion for not doing anything about it. I was actually shaking at this point. The CTO said he'd look into it, so I left. About 10 minutes later I had a phone call from the CEO apologizing profusely for the behavior and letting me know that the manager had been fired and was being escorted off the property by building security. He then all but begged me to come back. Abuse - whether physical or verbal - should not be tolerated. If I were you I would immediately go to his boss and let them know what happened. If they aren't willing to fix it, decide what you want to do but at the very least you should move on. 

That entire paragraph is a huge WTF. 6 person company? So there's the CEO, the PA, your boss and you. That leaves 2 other spots. Unless the CEO is a complete idiot I don't see how the above statement is even possible as the CEO will know exactly what each of those people are bringing in. My advice: stop over thinking this and stop reaching for more authority than you have and get on with the tasks assigned with you. You might want to do this quickly because a CEO is usually pretty good at sniffing out bad attitudes and will generally excise them to save the rest. Of course, the above advice is assuming that anything you said is even remotely true. There are a lot of internal inconsistencies in the story you provided. For example the following: 

I can't imagine any situation in which a person would be allowed to view the contract documents between those three companies. I can't even imagine that Company C would ever be able to see the contract that A signed with B. That just doesn't happen. Further, asking to view them yourself is seriously overstepping your bounds as the details of those contracts are highly confidential and certainly encompass far more than whether you are allowed to perform overtime work or not. The company that pays your check is the one that ultimately decides whether they pay over time and at what rate. That is the one you contact. All you have to do is email them to ask whether you are permitted to work over time and what the over time rate is. Beyond that nothing else is your concern. Your concern is to please the company that signs your check. If there is something they feel you need to know, such as things you are specifically forbidden to do, then they will let you know what it is. You likely should seek legal counsel to see if your fears on the $30k item are warranted or not. That said I fail to see how you could possibly be held liable for breaking terms of a contract that you are not privy to. Namely the deals between A and B as well as B and C. 

Let's put this into a little perspective. You decide to sell your used phone. Someone asks how much and you tell them. Then they say great and hand over that exact amount. At first you'll likely think "fantastic". However about 30 minutes later you'll wonder if you should have asked for more. This is normal behavior. To alleviate the problems that causes there are two paths. The easy one is to just give a counter that is close, but still a bit less than what they asked for. If they accept then they'll feel that they got everything they could. If they insist on the original amount then see the second path below: The second is to sit back, make a bit of a face and perhaps say something like "That much? Hmm. I'm not sure if we can do that. Give me a bit." If this is in person, walk out of the room and take a few minutes to get a drink. Then come back and agree. If it's on the phone tell them you'll call them back, hang up and wait about 15 minutes. Then call them back and say your boss approved it. Yes, it's just theater; but it's necessary theater in order to head off any thoughts that they "lost" out on something during the negotiation. 

These are all very real social interaction issues based upon your position and experience. Ultimately I think that maybe being a contractor isn't the right path for you at the moment. You should consider going somewhere where you are a regular full time employee. 

If you haven't been communicating with the appropriate people about why you were unhappy then doing so at the exit interview can only hurt you. Whether it's by burning a bridge or giving them something to tell a future employer if you use them as a referral. For example they could easily say: Bob doesn't communicate very well. To be quite frank, it just looks bad. I've had a few people move on to other jobs only to have them tell me on their way out why they were leaving - and for it to have been a solvable problem. At that point I then mark them as ineligible for rehire because if they can't be bothered to give me an opportunity to fix the problem then I won't be bothered to bring them back onto the team. 

Pay is a highly negotiable and individual item. It's the primary way that a company tells you what you are worth to them. Quite frankly pay for developers is all over the map. Part of the reason is that it's incredibly hard to find great developers and incredibly easy to find mediocre ones. Another reason is that sometimes great developers work for peanuts simply because they lack the fortitude to ask for more. Next, bear in mind that salary survey sites aren't always very accurate. Most are based on a tiny subset of the population - namely those who provided some of their individual info in order to gain access to what other people are claiming they make. It would be rare for a company to release actual salaries to those sites. The real test is what the company is currently paying their team and what it would take to replace you. If you are going above and beyond then that has value. Most managers know this. For example, I've had situations where one dev working for me was paid nearly twice what another one doing a very similar job was paid, with similar work experience. The reason was simply that I could count on the higher paid guy to produce a vastly higher quality of work than the other so I made sure he was compensated accordingly. In another situation I had a middle of the road guy making far more than the rest of the group simply because the market at that time was such that it was hard to find people and I needed that spot filled. Bearing the above in mind, remove all concepts of "fairness" from your thoughts. Life is, by nature, completely unfair; business life doubly so. Pay is a negotiation between what you think you are worth and what value the company places on you. Again, this has nothing at all to do with what others are making. Hopefully the two are somewhat in line. Side note: I'd stay away from talking pay with other employees. When people discuss this someone (usually all parties) ends up unhappy.. but that's a completely separate subject. All of that said, Never be afraid to ask for more money during the review; that's the time to do it. If for some reason your manager loves you but can't get a raise pushed through then there are usually other options. For example maybe they might be able to give you extra vacation time, provide a company laptop, or even provide licenses for you to use your dev tools at home.
