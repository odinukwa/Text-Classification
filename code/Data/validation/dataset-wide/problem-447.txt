Precusor technology limitation. Your space superiority fighters are derived from ancient precursor alien technology. The basis of that technology requires neural inputs from a living being. "Independence Day" Apple powerbook virus worry Humans are worried not about "Terminator" scenario, but about "Independence Day" scenario - aliens interfacing with, and hacking the fighter's AI. A human pilot doubles as "antivirus" hacker. "Ender's Game" scenario - fighter pilots become colonists upon victory. Your major concern is speed of colonizing territory you won. Sending a colony ship is impossible (why? Ask a separate WB.SE question :) So, you send fighter pilots, who in case of victory double up as a colonization force. And enemy planets don't need major terraforming so fighters with no colony ships are enough. The Force is weak with AI Humans have a substrain of precogs (people with developed precognitive sense, for several seconds' duration). Tactical space combat realities would make any space fighter NOT equipped with a precog pilot be inferior, since a precog can predict what an opponent would do BEFORE the opponent does it, even if it's a fast AI. 

Basically, given the largely Laissez-faire deity like this, most likely a set of competing religions would spring up, which would formulate religious rules to satisfy the needs of the local power elites - the same way Christianity was severely transformed once Roman Empire decided to adopt it for a state religion. Specific details would heavily depend on (1) precise basic moral rules the deity declared and (2) the level of spiritual enforcement of said rules the deity declared (does your immortal soul go to hell, or do you simply get soup-Nazi "No Salt-Shaker for You"?) 

To complement the excellent answer by @Thucydides (e.g, the most realistic scenario for a knowledge based company would be to simply change primary employment jurisdiction to a country with different labour laws - as many of them have a lot of experience with from outsourcing and international campuses. Intel, Microsoft, Google etc... all have non-USA campuses galore, as do the likes of Goldman Sachs): The company would try to rationalize resource allocation and labour division: 

Gravitational force field on the torus surface. Inner side of the torus is right, outer side is left. It may be counter-intuitive that the potential energy is equal on the whole surface, but the gravity strength is changing. Equal potential energy only means that the force always points into the surface and walking around does not require work. But the gravitational force will change. It is strongest inside the torus where the centrifugal and the gravitational forces add up. It is weakest at the outside, where they subtract. Results The most important result is that if you precisely balance the gravitational and the centrifugal force, the toroidal planet can indeed be stable. The planet must rotate very quickly, otherwise it will collapse to a sphere. In this case once in 2.65 hours. Other parameters valid for my planet are listed below, but there can probably be many others that work as well. 

Image from Yongyun Hu and Jun Yang, PNAS 111 629â€“634 (2013), doi: 10.1073/pnas.1315215111 You can notice on this Figure from meteorological model od Hu & Yang that the substellar point is not the hottest place, thanks to the wind. The hottest places are two points just above and below it. However, if Earth got tidally locked, the Coriolis force would be almost non-existent and the most dominant feature would be air rising at substellar point and near-ground winds moving towards it. (There some videos exploring this scenario 1, 2, 3, although not the wind pattern itself.) This situation was described in Vincent's and PipperChips answers. Do not miss: The transition from wind pattern of slow rotating planets without Coriolis force and quickly rotating planets of red dwarfs is nicely illustrated in Oceaniis' post at the Forum of Speculative Evolution. Interesting source is also this post at the SpaceEngine forum. Interesting source for deeper study is also thesis of R. A. Edson. 

People tend to interpret the data to suit their innate biases [citation needed] As such, Portland, OR (as you noted, not a hotbed of a religious thought) would 

For the background: Although the needs/situation are purely Earthly-reality-based, the background is not. 

"Andromeda"'s "Slipstream" approach. Your FTL technology relies on slipstream that can only be navigated by a human pilot. Obviously stolen from Gene Rodenberry's "Andromeda" show. 

Similar to #2a, but in geopolitical instead of religious context. The country was in a major war with Luftisia. Luftisians are avid vegetarians. The war was nasty, long, and anyone who in any way shape or form can be accused of Luftisian influence/sympathies is in for a rough time. 

Plant based alternatives are an issue. To have a sustainable vegetarian diet, you need access to plant based protein - legumes, avocado, etc... If that requirement is a problem, that's the root of prohibition on veganism (non-vegan vegetarianism is not affected as they can use milk or eggs). E.g.: 

People mentioned religion, but hand-waved why that would be the case. Specific religious roots could be: 

Engage the services of media makers. Producers, film directors. As with #2, the approach #1 helps you win points with them. Have them make propaganda movies that paint you in good light. Cuba successfully did that with Michael Moore. 

More specific societal response would strongly depend on scientific effects (which OP noted are offtopic for this question) However, sudden seasonal climate changes would likely wreak havoc on food availability. This would likely lead to food shortages, and in Portland, likely rationing, price controls, and not impossibly, full on nationalization of food supply and distribution. 

Main reason: You're hedging against ELE (Extinction Level Event) Another answer mentioned alien threat, but ELE's can happen for other reasons as well - meteorite, supervolcano (Toba nearly led to humans becoming extinct in the past; and we are right up against Yellowstone deadline), super-plague, nano-gray-goo, Large Hadron Collider Creating Black Hole, Chthulu wakes up, Singularity, Judgement Day (of Terminator type, not religious type). Elon Musk spoke on this extensively when discussing his vision of Mars colony in real life. Early investment. Yes, the colonies aren't expected to produce much benefit now. But if technology/surcumstances/etc.. change in the future such that they can - they will have already been there, ready to benefit. High-risk investors would be all over that like Lehman on subprime mortgages. Political freedom Plenty of people chafe under the less-free society that invariably gets imposed on everyone due to population density. Various libertarian minded (or anarchist etc...) people would be VERY interested in a new frontier, where you don't have to worry about intrusive laws, regulations, coddling the weak, etc... In the past, they moved to real frontiers. Wild West in America. These days they dream of seasteading or moving to Vermont. Give them whole worlds to be free in and you have plenty of interested individuals. This has the dual benefit: Earth gets rid of "live free or die" people who chafe under "world Government", "daddy government", "big government", and the like - WITHOUT violating their freedom. They go on their own volition, attracted by the frontier. Secondly, collecting such people helps you succeed better in colonization - those ARE the kinds of people who have the psychological drive to succeed as a colonist. 

There is very detailed discussion about this issue in the field of Astrobiology. There is many constrains for "reasonable" life. I will try to go through most of them in short points. Let me use following approximate definition of life in my answer: 

Alternative viewpoint: Maybe we shouldn't assert that behavior of aliens is in all situations so different from ours. Aliens, if they are evolved creatures like us, probably evolved their psychology to best serve evolution strategy they need. We can notice that dogs, for example, behave not so differently from us. Probably because they are pack animals, same as we are. Cats on the other hand, are solitary predators, and they may be quite inscrutable - their evolutionary strategy is different than ours. There is interesting (although very speculative) hypothesis how our psychology and morality is shaped by our evolutionary origins. It is called Moral Foundations Theory (more here and here). It assumes that morality of almost any society of humans contains elements of five pillars, which have quite clear evolutionary origin: 

The theory of Late Heavy Bombardment says that approximately 4 billions of years ago, something disturbed the orbits of asteroids in the Kuiper belt, which caused extremely heavy bombardment of Earth by asteroids. This probably brought many heavy elements to Earth's surface. The heavy elements that were here previously, during the Earth's formation, sank to the core when the Earth was liquid which made them out of reach. In other words, if there was no Late Heavy Bombardment, the surface of Earth might have been almost without elements much heavier than silicon. (Iron, gold, silver, platinum and others would be extremely rare.) My question: If humans developed the same way they did, what kind of technology would be achievable almost without elements much heavier than silicon? 

No, banking isn't rendered worthless, circa 2016. However, people would need to spend a bit of an extra effort to not be victims. 

NOTE: I would prefer answers based on real research into religions and psychology. But you don't have to be limited to that. 

Economic unrest. New enterprising rich types clashing with existing power structures. Think French Revolution, or February 1917 revolution in Russia. Set up "economic free zones" for enterprising types. Less regulation, more law and order. Make it easy to move to/from there This has the added benefit of keeping your country economically vibrant and viable, without bleeding those enterprising types out of gene pool through immigration or tyrannical suppression. Lack of law and order. Set up "frontiers" to keep the rough, the tough, the footloose and the risk-takers busy. Ideally, far away so they aren't tempted to return to stir up trouble, only to retire. That will productively channel and/or isolate most of your psychopath types, or even regular destabilizing people. Seasteading. Space. Raiding neighbours. Desire to improve the life of the "oppressed". See, Russian Revolution, or Occupy iPhones, or whatnot. Most of those aren't actually dissent from the oppressed, but from people who are higher up the social chain, caring about said oppressed. Set up philantropy and "for the common good" programs to keep the bleeding hearts happy and busy. Very few people want a bloody revolution, if the alternative to better life for others is Habitat for Humanity type work - especially if it's effective and efficacious. Unrest and revolts by the people who have little to lose and safety and stability to gain. Let's cover that in detail in next topic 

Cattle used for "fluoride brainwashing" So... you wish to brainwash your populace via use of a chemical that we'll alludingly call a "fluoride". Except... you don't have a way to "fluoridize" the central water supply in 1700s the way you do in 1800s. Nor can you poison every farmer's plants. BUT... you CAN more readily disperse the chemical to the cattle! (I can offer specific ways but that'd be a separate question :) So, to ensure people don't avoid the brainwashing, we are prohibiting vegetarianism. Probably, along with hunting wild animals. 

There is quite simple formula that will give you the tidal-locking half-time $$T = 6 Ã— 10^{12}\, \frac{a^6 R \mu}{ (M_s M_p^2)}\; \mathrm{years}$$ 

Although my answer is surely opinion-based, I think the answer is: probably never. The reason is, that if you would like to compare human and animal genetic code to a computer code, it would look like 0 % of logic and structure and hundreds of millions years of debugging. This is how evolution works: random mutations are created and if they are useful, they spread. Computer programming can also by done this way with use of genetic algorithms. The results are often effective, but completely incomprehensible to humans. Already today, we can insert almost any DNA we wish into a cell. One could write DNA as a long series of letters and we would be able to synthesize it. The problem is not in the technology, but that we do not know what it will do. Since it is so hard to understand the DNA code, fine changes will probably always require extensive amount of research and experiments. The code is just too messy to change it so simply. If all animals are "very poorly written", we might ask how close are we to writing animals from scratch. It also seems very, very problematic. Unlike life, our software is very hierarchic. Higher level of programming relies on precise translation into assembler-like processor instructions, which rely on processors performing very precisely many simple tasks. Even processor is basically a simple part - transistor - copied many many times into very precise structure. Each level works perfectly and can be completely separated from the next. This allows us to understand it and write software efficiently. Basic units of life - proteins, are much more messy. They do not by any way work so cleanly as transistors and one probably needs much more trials and errors to persuade the whole machinery of proteins to work as intended, cooperating with other proteins. My estimate is that we could still need hundreds of years to find a way around it. 

There are a wide variety of issues with IQ-based voting systems. First of all, there's absolutely no basis to think that IQ based voting system would in some way be superior, even if it worked as designed/intended, for a variety of reasons. 

For more details on motivated reasoning, I would recommend a recent series of episodes on "You're not so smart" podcast. People with high IQ are not guaranteed to be experts at picking political leaders. So, in representative democracy (instead of direct issue voting) IQ is not that relevant. Even assuming the (wholly incorrect, as per previous point) assumption that somehow, high IQ can lead to "correct" positions being taken by voters, that doesn't translate into picking "correct" politicians. Obama hoodwinked a whole lotta progressives (including high-IQ ones) into thinking he'll establish their utopia (as well as whole lotta conservatives afraid of the same). Instead, from him, they got TPP, Wall Street bailouts, support for Hillary over Bernie in 2016, wars in Afghanistan, Lybia and Syria; drone bombings; NSA ubiquitous spying; and more illegal deportations than under Bush. Trump hoodwinked whole lotta voters that he'll build the wall, deport tons of illegal aliens (he deported less than Obama did), drain the swamp, move the Israeli embassy to Jerusalem, repeal Obamacare, etc... So far most of the promises he made didn't pan out for his voters. I won't even go into high-IQ support for genocidal psychopaths listed in bullet #1 above. Issues that require resolving are frequently beyond understanding of any single person, even with 110 or 140 IQ; unless they spend their life studying them. Having high IQ doesn't mean you know jack U&*t about economics (as many high-IQ marxists prove). What makes you think non-economist with high IQ would be good at voting for the right people/issues when it comes to economics?
