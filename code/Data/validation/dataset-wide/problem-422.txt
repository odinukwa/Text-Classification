A lot of responses on here seem to be unable to get past the obstacle of the joke creator dying from thinking of the joke. That isn't a real obstacle, since, in theory, the joke could be devised by an AI program. Also, a lot of responses seem to be unable to get past the obstacle of how a messenger could relay the joke without dying. That also isn't a real obstacle, since the joke could be delivered via an internet message, telegram, video, etc. without human intervention. It's not unreasonable that after AI generates the joke, it could, in an automated fashion, use a bot account to send a private message to the victim via social media, or create a video and post it on youtube, or something of that nature. It is definitely within a computer program's ability to automatically generate videos, and you have probably seen some on youtube without knowing it. Can a person die from laughing at a joke? Yes. For the most part, this has a lot more to do with the person's overall health and psyche than the contents of the joke itself. But if a joke were gargantuanly hilarious, it might be able to kill many healthy people. It would just have to be a multiple of as funny as a joke that could kill an unhealthy person. Is a person and/or AI clever enough to construct a joke that is that funny? All I can say to speak to that is that there are already automated systems that make psychological profiles of everybody in America, use AI to formulate memes / rhetoric that would be most persuasive to influencing their opinion, and distribute it through social media using bots. So the same approach would definitely be usable to make automated systems that can make a deep psychological profile on a specific assassination target and formulate jokes that would be highly funny for that person. Even moreso, since said jokes are targetted for that person's unique psychological make-up, it might be lethal only to the target and some other similar people, and therefore might be sub-lethal for most other human messengers that are telling the joke. $URL$ Also, circle back to the theory that a lethal joke would kill the writer of the joke itself... if it is such a struggle to construct a joke that is lethal, and if your very best effort is barely sufficient to do the job, then this joke wouldn't be lethal to anyone that is marginally less vulnerable. So, for example, if a human architect of the joke found the joke 20% less funny, then it wouldn't kill them (this is a stretch, since people often find their own jokes funny). But messengers on the other hand... it's very plausible to teach the joke to a messenger in a way that is very unfunny, for example, by repeating the setup hundreds of times before they ever hear the punchline, or by teaching them the joke while under chemical sedation so that their heart rate never gets too high. By the time they're reciting the joke in a live setting, they've already heard the joke under sedation many times, they've rehearsed it in rote fashion, and the joke has gotten boring and routine. 

It seems that you are positing that the cost of methane, fresh water, and electricity will plummet in the region around the Sahara. Based on this premise alone, fossil fuels would not necessarily disappear. The most expensive fossil fuels (e.g. oil shales) would be shut down, but existing, land-based oil wells are extremely inexpensive to run and would continue to produce oil even at very low market prices. An inexpensive source of alternative energy would make it much easier to pass anti-fossil fuel legislation in an effort to reduce climate change. I will assume that such a law goes into effect, and that it is enforced successfully across the entire globe. When wealth comes from fixed resources which are tied to geography, the result is usually an oppressive regime and tremendous wealth/power disparities. In the feudal era lords became the government because they controlled agricultural land. They did not control the tradesmen in the cities because those people were highly mobile and could take their wealth generating ability with them. In the modern era most nations where mineral wealth represents a large proportion of the GDP come to be governed by whatever small group of people control that mineral resource (often oil). This is the case in Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, Russia, The Central African Republic, etc. If a fairly small group of people is in control of this Sahara Project, it will rule in an authoritarian manner. Employees and other residents of the area will not have strong rights such as freedom of speech. Owners will appoint the judges or whatever arbiters are used for the legal system. There will be no rule of law governing disputes between owners and everyone else, as the owners will always win every dispute. There might be rule of law governing disputes between non-owners though. The ownership class will get away with rape, murder, assault, and theft. Their children will be enormously wealthy and immune to law, but will often have no real power until their parents reach retirement age. Held in a state of perpetual adolescence their behavior will be terrible. Politics among the ownership class will be cutthroat as everyone will jostle for power in the absence of an objective rule of law. Despite what you say about there not being locals to displace, every piece of land (with the possible exception of Antarctica) has people who consider it theirs. The owners might be miles away, but they exist. It is very likely that the project would proceed as follows: A large foreign company (backed by massive injections of private capital) approaches the local people of each region of the Sahara and negotiates a deal with them. Normally the locals would receive little compensation in these types of contracts, but foreign lawyers rush in to represent the locals for no cash up front but a huge share of revenue. Thus the locals are able to negotiate very lucrative joint ownership contracts with the company. In the ensuing years the cleverest locals are able to buy out other locals using a wide variety of clever business tactics. When ownership finally stabilizes, a very few families control most of the land and become the de facto royalty (similar to the establishment of the house of Saud). The rest of the local families form a long tail of mid level and small time nobles - much wealthier and more powerful than workers, but trivial compared to the royalty. The ownership class will consist of the native land holders, major company shareholders, the company board and officers, and the lawyers who helped the land holders negotiate the deal. Labor, both skilled (there will need to be engineers to install, maintain, and troubleshoot the facilities) and unskilled, will be non-citizen resident workers. They will have few rights, and will not be allowed to retire in the Sahara. Their children will not have citizenship. Any adult without a job (or a spouse with a job) will be forced to leave. Any child without employed parents will be forced to leave. The Sahara company will need to run its own military as the facilities will be very vulnerable to sabotage, terrorism, and military attack. Pipelines and power lines can be bombed. Solar panels can be destroyed by nearly anything. Electrical substations in particular are extremely vulnerable to attack. If the Sahara can do this, then other deserts would likely be almost as good and would replicate this economy. Expect large rival projects in the Atacama, Australia, southern Africa, the Namib, Mexico, and the US southwest. The Gobi will be able to produce huge amounts of power, even if water is not convenient. The old oil powers will experience upheaval. Smart families will be among the investors in the Sahara company (and its competitors). Stupid families and nations will just become poor and irrelevant. Oil will still be used for plastics and lubricants, so it will not go away, but its price will plummet. Plastics, in particular, will become extremely inexpensive. The governments of the oil nations will be overturned. These nations will become much more normal, with governments which are controlled by a wide variety of industrial and commercial powers rather than just a tiny minority of oil powers. The behavior of these nations would become less outrageous as they adopt policies more in line with what makes business leaders happy. (i.e. stability, rule of law, free markets) Coal has never comprised a large fraction of any nation's GDP and its collapse will not result in major changes to any nation state. Coal will have essentially no use in a post-fossil fuel economy. The same goes for natural gas. Norway and Alaska will face financial crises and be forced to cease their negative taxation programs. You mention the electricity being sold to Africa, but a large portion would also go north, under the Mediterranean to Europe. The cost of power increases with the length of transmission lines, so there would be a gradient of electricity prices based on distance from deserts. Wherever electricity is cheapest, massive aluminum smelting operations will be established. If the average price of power across the globe decreases, then so will the cost of aluminum (as well as titanium). Aluminum smelting operations produce enormous quantities of waste heat, which could presumably be used in the already existing water purification plants. Having massive quantities of cheap, fresh water available in areas with plentiful sunshine and warm temperatures would result in an ideal agricultural environment. The price of food should plummet as Saharan vegetables become common ingredients at the dinner table. The change in albedo and evaporation rates this would produce in the deserts would cause unpredictable climate changes. Winds would move a little differently, and rainfall would happen in different places. In general though, the net result would be a slightly wetter, not a drier world - especially in the areas around the desert zones. It is very unlikely that the national borders of the desert regions would be redrawn, so I think you should assume that the nations containing large amounts of desert would become much more powerful. This would include Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Morocco, Oman, Yemen, Syria, and Iraq, but also Namibia, and Chile. I think you should have Saudi Arabia be one of the smart oil powers which smoothly parlays its oil wealth into Sahara Project investments. Russia seems likely to wind up a very big loser in this transition. It has little access to solar power, and has hobbled its industrial and commercial economies with crazy oil-state authoritarianism. This could be awkward as they still have one of the largest nuclear arsenals in the world. Perhaps the US and China restart the Clinton-era policy of purchasing Russian fissile material from old nuclear warheads? (If you're not aware, during the 1990s the USA purchased huge quantities of uranium and plutonium from old Soviet warheads, and then burned this material in US power reactors. In exchange Russia gained much needed cash during their transition from communism.) 

Seeing how transition would not happen in a moment but rather over decades, the problem would kind of solve it self by simply diminishing the amount of meat we consume from actual livestock and trend more towards vat-grown meat. Slowly, steadily, vat-grown meat production ramps up and becomes more profitable and sustainable (and as people start to trust it more), however real meat will never stop being produced. It is just like we have artificial sweeteners and actual sugar. We have GMO foods and non-GMO foods. There is market for everything. Lets draw a parallel with our own world and how it is dealing with transitioning from fossil fuel to sustainable green energy. It is not happening over night - fossil fuel is still used very much but over time as more green-energy power plants are created less people will have a need for fossil fuels. In your scenario people would also slowly start to transition and as there are less customers for actual meat it would be produced less as farms start to fail due to not being profitable. Some farms would still function as high-end brands that deliver 'organic meat' if that thing is allowed in the world for those that prefer it to vat-grown stuff. But overall, decades in after vat-grown meat appears on the market it will simply push out the organic meat as farms go out of business or switch their factories to produce vat-grown instead of actual meat. Eventually an equilibrium will be reached on the market. Animals that were grown in those farms would not go extinct - cows, sheep, goat etc. still live in nature even though we grow them for consumption ourselves. Their numbers would probably dwindle but i doubt they would go extinct. Plus, animals are grown (and/or slaughtered) for reasons other than meat - production of milk (and from that other dairy products), skins, fertilizer, pets... As for controversy there will always be a camp of people that will prefer natural meat and will campaign against vat-grown stuff for the same reason people protest GMO foods today. There will be people that will protest meat eaters, just like vegans do today. There will be those that will complain about long-term health effects that we may not know. People will probably argue that vat-meat factories pollute the world more than natural farms and waste more energy. Naturally you will have politicians claiming that the industry is bad because it is taking away jobs from farmers, veterinarians, cattle growers and medicine makers that ensure cattle remains health. Just look at any industry that has pushed some other older technology out of the market and see the arguments that people used. 

The magnetic fields have effectively disappeared many times in the past (during periods of magnetic field reversal). This has not correlated with extinction events, so I see no reason to think it would be dangerous at all. $URL$ Also, the current magnetic field funnels charged particles down onto the poles, yet the animals living at the poles seem unaffected. 

I would point out that the atmosphere doesn't need to be lost to thin out. The atmospheric composition has varied widely over time based almost entirely on gases becoming locked up in soil and crustal rock. The mass of the atmosphere is roughly 10,000 times smaller than the mass of the crust, meaning tiny changes in the way that gases become sequestered can make huge differences in the atmosphere. You might invent a new form of oceanic plant life which is a prolific nitrogen fixer, and composed of a substance which is very difficult for oceanic microorganisms to break down. Just this type of scenario happened during the carboniferous period. During this time plants began producing lignin and suberin in large quantities for the first time. Microorganisms were unable to break down these substances before they became buried. This buried organic material contained huge quantities of carbon (eventually becoming much of the coal available to us today), meaning that the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere plummeted, oxygen levels soared to 45%, and the climate cooled 8 degrees C. I suggest nitrogen in particular because it is 78% of the current atmosphere. I think the phrase you will want to google is "nitrogen sequestration". Here is one example of an article discussing how nitrogen is sequestered currently. $URL$ 

Easiest way to do this is to treat it like martial arts, which is the most relatable thing to magic in our own world. If you read Miamoto Musashis 'The Book of Five rings' where he explains his mastery of swordsmanship and how to perfect it yourself you will often find that he cannot explain a concept with certainty. Closest he can come to is a feeling, an instinct that becomes part of you after endless repetition. He tries to compare it to other subjects but often fails because he just cannot describe an internal, intuitive knowledge so he says "it is easy to show this but difficult to describe". In my opinion magic should be treated the same way. Something elusive, difficult to master and explain. Something that relies on repetition and intuition. Internal understanding. 

Based on the description of the conditions that these people live in I would say that there are several ways of sustaining a population on a floating island. 1) Agriculture on a massive scale is not possible due to lack of space but what if your floating landmasses have cave systems which could be used to grow mushrooms? Citizens of these floating cities would need to dig the cave, maintain it and grow mushrooms in a system similar to hydroponics. Mushrooms can grow easily but my family used to grow them on sacks of wood and sawdust. People living in your floating island could just stack these things for a rather large farm. 2) Are hanging gardens a possibility? They could perhaps grow fruits on a massive floating garden which hangs from the sides or bellow the island. A complicated system for harvesting will most likely be required but plants could grow "upside down". They would have access to plenty of sun and water from the air. Nitrogen supplies could be a bit problematic for the plants, but your citizens would need to get them somehow and apply them to the plant roots. 3) Hunting is an option, depending on what kind of wildlife inhabits their world. Are flying whales or any other large flying creature a thing in your world? If yes those floating ships could be used for hunting expeditions. They could hunt large flocks of birds with massive nets. 4) Raids on the ground or the ocean. I know you said going down to the ground is forbidden, but a man's gotta eat. Perhaps a blessing to a special cast of hunters could be given to venture on the ground to forage for supplies? Sending flying ships to hunt for fish would not violate those rules. Expeditions to tree-top farms? 5) Insect farms. Maggots will grow on rotting corpses and you mentioned zombies being a problem in the world. Kidnapping them, putting them down and using them for maggot fuel could perhaps provide some meager sustenance to your citizens. 6) Your floating population can easily get water from air by gathering morning dew and rainwater. They would, however, not have enough water for luxury and would most likely have terrible hygiene.
