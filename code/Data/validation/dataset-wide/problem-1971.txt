"No, I won't. You're not my boss, and I'm not your secretary." That should be your answer to any "just do it" command from this co-worker for a clerical task. Similar variations can be derived for commands to do something a particular way when you know how to do it better, or to do tasks that are clearly his personal responsibility. In short, if there's no supervisory or other over-under relationship between the two of you, then he can do no more than politely request that you help him out. If he makes such a request, consider it, provided you have time and effort to spare. If he crosses the line from request to command, he's also passed beyond polite and you should respond in kind; keep it civil, but unambiguous. I disagree that you should say "yes" to a task and then proceed to ignore it. That screws everyone up; your co-worker will expect you to get his work done and then be hung out to dry when you don't, he'll blame you saying you agreed to do it (which you did), and you'll catch heat, and in the meantime your boss is catching heat from whomever wants whatever the coworker was doing done, and it goes up both managerial chains from there. Yes, this behavior forces a solution, but there are much more professional ways to address the problem and get it resolved. The solution you are likely to get from these kinds of underhanded tactics will probably include negative consequences for many more people than probably deserve it. 

The result of this process is that the dev team knows exactly what they will be working on in two week (and thus hopefully easy-to-estimate) "sprints", having made the decision and the commitment to do these things themselves, and knows that this will not change barring some earth-shattering event. The department managers submitting the work also know this, and should also find out very quickly that you will not accept any attempts to end-run around this process. If properly enforced and followed, your team will be more productive, the people who need things done will be happier because they'll know when it will be done, and overall efficiency of the whole process will improve. 

Making sure you address someone by their proper name, either in voice or text, is of course a mark of respect of a fellow human being that should be expected in all interpersonal communication. However, don't fly off the handle. Most of these mistakes, especially in initial stages of conversation, are perfectly innocent. In particular, technology can often be more hindrance than help. I'm sure you have seen the merry mishaps that occur when a computer "decides" that when you typed one thing you really meant another. "Spell-as-you-go" aka "auto-correct" is probably the single greatest barrier to communication in the modern world, and most of us who care about saying what we mean turn these tools off. Case in point; "Arold" -> "Arnold" is a totally understandable abuse of auto-correct (in fact as I type this, Chrome has "Arold" underlined in red, with the first suggestion being "Arnold"). Both my wife and I constantly deal with this in casual communication. For my part, I'm often the victim of the grade-school rule, "I before E except after C"; "Keith" is from Gaelic, on which the "I before E" rule has absolutely no bearing (the rule is based on the major parents of Old English, Proto-Germanic and Proto-French). My wife's name is Darci (yet another red-tag by Chrome there), and that is constantly misspelled "Darcy", and we've also seen complete outliers like "Darcey", "Darsy" and similar. You have two solutions. First, you can ignore it. Yes it's annoying, but it's also small stuff; of the 90 people who will transpose I and E in my name today, I will never speak to 80 of them ever again. Many times, the written form of your name is simply something for someone to call out when it's your turn (your lunch is ready, or the doctor will see you now, or whatever you might be waiting for at the time). In professional communication, try a three-strikes rule (three messages from the other person with the misspelling, with replies from you containing your correct name in the signature line) before politely pointing out the error. If they ignore the correction, or take offense, walk away. You may have wanted the job, but you do deserve the respect of having your name spelled out correctly, even if it may cause a minor inconvenience. In solicitation that borders on unwanted (you may be mildly interested, but the misspelling is a turn-off) then you don't need three strikes; if you want to respond at all, point out their error in your first response; again, if they ignore it or take umbrage at being corrected, walk away. Obviously spam's spam; completely ignore it whether they bothered to spell your name right or not. 

You don't have the authority to do any of this; that's why you're bringing it to your boss. The only caveat in the whole thing is, you must bring problems to your boss while things can still be done to resolve them. If you see, three months out, that you're going to miss a deliverable, there's time to fix things by moving some people or dates around. If it's due tomorrow and there's 3 days' work left even if you all worked flat-out from now till the deadline, there's nothing to do but ask why you couldn't tell him sooner. 

Whatever you do, don't just circular-file it (electronically or otherwise). If you won't consider it, tell them that (and tell both of them that). Things won't change, in your inbox or anyone else's, if you ignore it; recruiters, and frankly candidates, are used to being ignored. They simply try again, and again, in hopes that they eventually catch you in a situation where you'd be more welcoming. By telling them that you received the e-mail, read, and understood it, and are rejecting it out of hand because its arrival in your inbox demonstrates extremely poor professional etiquette with which you will have no part, then the recruiter, and the candidate, receive behavioral feedback. The recruiter has just gotten his candidate black-balled from your organization (at least this hiring round), and importantly, now they both know that. 

It depends on the manager, really. Personally, my boss wouldn't blink at an occasional call or e-mail stating I couldn't come in, so long as it wasn't abused (Monday/Friday absenteeism, taking off with a deadline looming or on the day of a major meeting). The idea that "you're stressed and need a day off" can sound a bit selfish from pretty much anyone else's standpoint. How is your job more stressful than anyone else's on your team? Your boss's? Why should you get a random day off on short notice when everyone else is expected to show up? In addition, because it's this random day off that you're taking, in effect, "because I want to", it can make you look unreliable. Your boss usually likes to know who will be working for him in the next week or two and when, and if you make him wonder whether he'll get a call-in from you on any given day, that reflects poorly on you. Thus, when time off must be taken unplanned, it usually looks best when it's for good reason. However, the reality is that from time to time we all get that way. Everyone I know both personally and professionally has used a sick day to play hookey and recharge, including my current boss and his boss. We call it taking a "mental health day". There are specific other cute names for taking an unplanned day off for some non-work activity; "green fever" (want to go golfing), "deer flu" (first day of deer season), "anal glaucoma" ("I can't see my ass coming into work today"). Under our old company's policies, sick days could be taken for any reason including no reason at all, as long as you had the sick days to take. Under new policies of a company that's bought us, there has to be some substantiation of a personal illness or family emergency to take more than a single sick day. The general response from the management on our side has been to ignore personal time logging altogether for salaried employees. Thus, the difference in corporate attitudes toward "free-form vacation". 

The upshot is that you are "involved" in the process, but the team members are the ones who are "committed" to delivering the work. The standup is their tool to make sure they can deliver, and as such, they run it, not you. Your sole requirement is to ensure they have it and, if necessary, make sure it doesn't dissolve into a large discussion (standups should take 5-10 minutes tops). This can be a hard concept for a manager, but you seem to be into the self-managing teams paradigm, so hopefully it'll be an easier transition. Other tips: 

Not on its face, no. The problem generally comes when both you and the hiring company are working through multiple recruiters, and the recruiters aren't talking to each other about the candidates they're submitting. The end result is multiple copies of your resume on the desk of the hiring manager. This wastes time (he has to recognize your name and confirm that it's a dupe), and reflects badly on you, especially when a recruiter has padded your resume without your knowledge (and thus the hiring manager has resumes with two different skillsets and job experience sections with your name on them; which one's accurate? As the hiring manager I might just circular-file them both). To avoid this, you can either not work with a recruiter, work with only one recruiter, or tell all recruiters you work with that you must be contacted and give approval before the recruiter sends your resume to an employer, and they must tell you the company, department and hiring manager they are working with on the other end. That allows you to keep track of who has been sent your resume and by whom (of course you must keep these records) thus avoiding having multiple recruiters hired by the employer each sending them your resume; first to get you the scoop gets the credit should you be hired. Recruiters are often reluctant to part with this information; they usually get their money by referring you to the employer, not by telling you who's hiring. However if you tell them why, and make it a strict condition of their representing you, you may make them more willing to play ball, and more importantly you establish the working relationship between yourself and the recruiter and avoid having your reputation tarnished. 

The "rules" attached to a signing bonus, if any, will depend on the agreement you sign with the company. The most common condition of payment is tenure-based; you have to remain employed long enough to have been worth the company's money in the first place. At the very least, you usually have to complete some "probationary period" (most employees, whether they know it or not, begin their jobs under probation so it's easier for the company to call it off if they aren't doing the job). Sometimes, the signing bonus is paid in installments; half up front, a quarter at 3 months and the rest at 6, or in thirds, or whatever. It's very, very rare to be offered money just for saying yes with absolutely no strings attached; in that instance they're basically betting that you want the job as much as you want the money and so there's a built-in incentive for you to stick around long enough to pay them back in services rendered. 

Of course, I'm not in this position, nor is anyone else you'll get an answer from here, so there's what we feel is right (which, not being in your position, we would then tell you to do) and there's what we might actually do in your situation, faced with the actual consequences of the decision (like being out of work or maybe even blacklisted). You're right that the obvious thing to do is get the hell out. Honestly, if my recommendations from that company were predicated on doing homework for children I'm not real sure I'd want them. Job applications have a "may we contact your employer" checkbox for a reason, and trust me, there are MANY reasons to check this box which do not reflect poorly on you. I think this qualifies. The very first thing I would do if I were your friend is to check to see if I was being asked to commit a crime. Obviously it's plagiarism for the student, but if the author knowingly writes something for another person to hand in, it might be criminal fraud for the author as well. If this is true, most jurisdictions consider it wrongful or retaliatory termination (translated: illegal) to fire an employee for failure to perform an illegal act, and/or for reporting the request to perform such an illegal act to the authorities. There may be a "whistleblower act", or it may be considered in the interest of "public policy" (similar to firing an employee who files a workman's comp claim; if that were allowed, workman's comp would be useless). So, if your friend were to refuse, and was subsequently fired for failure to comply, she should hire a lawyer and file suit for wrongful termination. Any lawyer who heard that story would take the case on contingency and tack his fees on to the stipulated damages. If your friend actually commits the illegal act, and then reports the crime, she might still claim duress, but it would be harder, as an "at-will" employee, to argue that she was forced to commit the crime; ethically, she could have walked away ("it's just a job"), so she should have, and thus she is culpable for the crime if she commits it, making performing the action and then reporting it a very bad idea (she'd be basically turning herself in; a good thing to do, but she should definitely not expect a medal for it). If it's not a crime, it's at least extremely unethical. If I were her, I would be trying very hard to find out which schools and colleges the boss's children attend, and inform them (anonymously perhaps) that the assignment for such and such a student was produced entirely by someone else at the behest of the student's father, and that they should reconsider the student's grades and possibly their continued enrollment (if they're in private schools, the code of conduct usually prescribes expulsion for plagiarism). I will decline to speculate on what I, personally, would do in your friend's place with regard to actually doing the homework assignments. It's not useful to the discussion and would invite criticism either way. Suffice to say, if my boss considered me to be of so little value that he assigned me his children's homework, I would be looking for any way out that I possibly could, and I would not be shy in explaining why I wanted out to other prospective employers. 

This sounds like a form response. They're following a "script" meant to get people into interview chairs where questions can be asked and answered in person. Possible reasons: 

Have her supervisor, or the first "common" link in the chain of command between you and her, disillusion her of the notion that it is "her way or the highway"; it is in fact her manager's way or the highway. If that discussion does not occur (first common link in the chain is too high up to care about the drama of the little people, or more likely her immediate supervisor likes her or is afraid of her too much to be direct with her), then you take it to HR. If someone is making personal attacks against you, and direct in-person confrontation including a direct request to stop did not resolve the issue, then you escalate the issue until it gets dealt with. That may or may not include termination of anyone's employment, and if your co-worker keeps her job she will resent you for whatever disciplinary action actually occurred. She should be smart enough to keep that to herself; if not, you know where to go if the unpleasantness continues.
