I would not say it is needed in my experience, but it is certainly a bonus to be able to show examples of your work. I didn't have anything much to show my first 2 employers but I was able to demonstrate my knowledge and enthusiasm in the interviews and through the coding tests afterwards. (I'm in Belgium so I don't know how different it might be for you being in a neighbouring country.) As someone else has mentioned, if you haven't done a huge amount in your spare time it's a good idea to demonstrate that you have other interests. In fact, in some ways it is better to show that you do things other than programming in your free time as some employers may make negative assumptions about people who only do programming in their spare time (anything from lack of dedication to their work to poor social skills). 

As Jan Doggen has said in the comments, fixing these issues in your own time is not a good approach. You need to explain to your bosses what is at stake if security issues are not resolved. Firstly you have to impress on them just how many people out there are dedicating their time to breaching security for profit. Often people ignore security issues because they think that it is unlikely that this will ever affect them. Secondly you have to provide scenarios for each case for what could happen if you don't fix it and someone does get in. Consider the affect on the customers, the time it will take to remove any problems and as a result of these combined the potential losses to the company. People tend to sit up and take notice more when you bring monetary values into the discussion. If after this you can still not make them really care about the issue then you can either give up or find people who do. Many voices are heard more than just one. 

If you've done things as part of a job in a relevant work environment, then yes I would say that counts as experience. It's also worth applying to jobs anyway if you're not sure you have enough experience or even if you know that you don't have as much experience as they're asking for. (I know several people who have done this and got the job.) I don't think most people would consider 2 years or less as being very experienced but this may partly depend on your line of work. You're probably not considered entry level anymore but you wouldn't be assumed to be an expert either. I assume that all the jobs you are talking about were in the same field. 

More or less, you should remember is just try to be yourself. This means be cool and de-stress yourself. That is the most important preparation. In terms of being able to answer well, you should try to pick up best of your projects (that he/she might inquire about) - and study concepts deeper related to the same. The important part is that instead of focusing on a lot of details you should be able to articulate key achievements, important concepts and theory/reasoning behind those topics. Last but most important point -prepare a lot of questions. This really looks good that you care about the position, role, job profile and work culture you are going to join. 

Establish, the overall expectations - what you should have been doing, what; what is the critical evaluation of the work or what is the success criteria. Seek evaluation and feedback of work. What do they think of what you have done, what is the impact of that in business. What is the end value. Seek and agree on mode of reward - if only step 1 & 2 seems positive. Justify and speak for what rewards you expect or you think is fair. What you established in step 1 and 2 works well. 

This is a question that applies to all people not just interns. I am here putting up the basic thought process and then going on to your specific case. 1. Nature of reward: You may ask for reward in general - reward may include, "one time incentive" or bonus, "increase in fixed pay", "increase in variable pay", "ESOP", or "equity". Understand that each type of rewards has consequences for the company as far as current as well as future payout is concerned. So it is not at all obvious which way the company would agree to reward. Equity might be an easy bid when start up is close to day 1 and there is hardly any investment or revenue in place. However, otherwise the equity is something might be preferred last. Even to many employees ESOPs are given rather than direct equity. So in all, this boils down to the founder's or managements comfort on how they want to reward. Be open to the mode they are willing to work on. 2. Amount of Reward: What is also important is to establish how a 'given work' has implication to longer term earnings of the company that would justify the amount of reward. Given this, it is important that candidate's perception matches with that of managements. It may not be obvious that what you think might not be their top priorities. Put other way it is also important that you seek feedback about the effectiveness of the work -and quality of work- before talking about rewards. If they agree that your work has really shaped some strategic problems or is valuable in someway - then asking for reward becomes next obvious thing. if they don't quite think so, you know what to expect when looking for reward. 3. When This is critical. Great ideas seldom makes money. They become instrumental when the real products meets real markets. And there are lot of things that need to go right. Not to disappoint, but what is important is that for you to maximise your possible reward - or to make it easier to get through, it makes sense to put across at right time. Typically, it means things are 'complete' in some sense, some 'real feedback' of trial is available or some results are proven in some manner. Given all of the above: Here is what I would suggest: 

Probably only if the information is expressly mentioned. You can try to do some damage control anyway; if you think the information makes you look lazy, for example, you can bring up some examples of things you did that prove you aren't. I've generalised this answer a bit to make it more useful for others. You may find this article interesting. 

Given that you definitely told them you were not taking the job, simply contact them, tell them you received a healthcare membership card in error and ask them if you need to return it or shred it or anything. Addition: Depending on where you are you may want to keep records of your communications so that you're covered if someone tries to get you into trouble for this. 

If you have a contract it may state their policy on request/notification of absence so check that first. If not I would suggest that you inform them both as HR may need to know for administrative reasons and your supervisor is the one who will be affected by you not being able to work that day. Perhaps email your supervisor and CC HR. 

This depends partly on your reasons for missing work that day. If it is something you absolutely must do or would do regardless of their answer then it should be more informative. Otherwise it should be more for asking permission. Given that you do not want to disclose the reason for your absence you should be careful how you word the communications. For example "due to personal family reasons that I would rather not disclose". Hopefully your employer will be sympathetic and not press you for more information. 

It depends partly on the vulnerabilities you are trying to address. In the case of SQL if there's any risk of confidential data being accessed or databases being dropped it's obviously a fairly major concern. You also have to assess if your job is at risk if something does go wrong - how protected are you if you prove that the managers prevented you from fixing the offending security problem? 

When asking whether you should worry you need to consider the following: How often do employers google prospective employees and how thoroughly? This happens more and more now as people put so much information online but perhaps not as often as people think. The intentions can be a mix of looking for examples of a persons work (particularly in the software industry) and looking for any warning signs not to employ that person. The skill and thoroughness of this depends on the employer. Some will not be as tech savvy as others, there are still many older people in work who do not have a good grasp of computing or do not know about the information it is possible to find online. What is the nature of the information? If it is indicative of criminal activity, things like racism or particularly bad behavior like binge drinking and getting into a fight you should defninitely worry a lot. If displays aspects of your character or past behavior that isn't illegal or offensive then you have to ask if it would cause an employer to have second thoughts about hiring you. Unless it's particularly bad then this will not necessarily cause them to outright reject you. If it's just personal information that you find embarassing then you do not need to worry as any decent employer should not be affected by it. I would say you are probably the third option with a bit of the second based on the information you gave. Where is it ranked on google under different combinations of search terms? If it's not on the first page then I consider it highly unlikely that you need to worry. In fact if it's not in the top 5 then for the majority of cases you are probably fine. Is it obvious before you click on it that it's about you sepcifically? If not then this reduces the risk of clicking and even if you do click it would have to be practically beyond doubt you being referred to. How possible is it to get the information deleted or hidden? If it is an individual rather than a news site it will obviously be a lot easier. In your case it should be quite easy to do this as it is a friend. Any things on social networking sites can generally be reported or have privacy settings changed. If your friend refuses to change the details you can potentially report the content depending on where the blog is hosted. You can use search engine optimisation (or SEO) to outrank the bad results on google but it will take time. You can also take a legal route but again this could take time and possibly money. 

You have a tough job in your hand. And as far as i understand there isn't straight forward way to go! But change you need. And it can only be through a tough perseverance you can get. 

Ref check of employers is just important as ref checks of employees. Yes, in most cases, when we are dealing with big companies is always available - however, it is not a given that company always is reliable. Personal interview is usually a must; and at least you should know the horizons and path for your career ahead. In a situation like this you should have asked for a personal meet with the proprietor and have one-to-one about what went wrong. May be you could just make a call now! 

I would agree with raise as suggested by others. Because they will have aspirations to grow. However, in my view that is not enough. There are several other factors that motivate people - specially the tech oriented ones- 

Ok, depending on the norms and law, you CAN really question this in some parts of the world. But i think there is not much hope to get good out of it. You cannot really fight to get the job back - but you can ask for compensation, certificate or even joining bonus if promised. TIP: Since it's only been 1 day for you, it doesn't look like a big gap, you can just forget about it and join some other organization quickly. 

Try to keep a fixed regular meetings rather than agenda. E.g. we do weekly project review or bi-weekly status meeting or something. And keep reminding him. this works better than specific agenda meetings because it sets the rhythm and he probably keep in mind that i need to dedicate time. Use calender as much as possible. So even if he doesn't honor the meeting actually, as number of instances of lost meetings grow, you will get some attention. Keep him posted - of all events, consequences. Many people (specially the busy ones) focus only to attend the top priority. So when you keep sending message they will respond automatically when they find it important enough. Don't wait for meeting to discuss to send out important message. Catch him for few minutes in corridors. Sometimes leaving them with a small agenda (puzzle in their minds) is enough to activate them rather than an elaborate meeting. What you should look forward is to bring his focus to the key issue leaving so many details. Don't fight to get more time. What do you need him for? If you need for decision making - you should put up the context right to him along with deadline. But if you need his time to learn new things or understand some processes or systems, find alternative sources for information. Sometimes bosses don't really have time for coaching everyone. Last but most important. Keep going on your own! Don't get bothered so much about getting appointment. Many of my team members feel what you said - i don't give them time. Sometimes, i just don't have to. I Know things are in control, i know people are doing their job well enough and i don't need to intervene unless something break; but they just feel disappointed not to find my time; rather they should have felt happy about being empowered. [Judge him on this before you use this tip.]
