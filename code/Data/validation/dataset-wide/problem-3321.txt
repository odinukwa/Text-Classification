(Transcribing all of these because my computer does not like changing text direction mid-line.) There doesn't seem to be any obvious connection between *sk(e)h₃-tos and šēdu, in form or in meaning. This is more likely just a coincidence. 

It's for historical reasons, really. If I were looking at that Spanish data in isolation, I would agree with you: I'd call the phonemes /b d ɟ ɡ/, then say that the stops became fricatives in certain environments (and that the palatal stop was realized as an affricate elsewhere, which is a very common thing for palatal stops to do). But with Spanish, we aren't looking at it in isolation: we know what phonemes Latin and other Romance languages had/have, so we know the diachronic changes that led to today's Spanish. In particular, /b d ɡ/ come from Latin /b d ɡ/, which were almost always [b d ɡ] (indicated by Latin grammarians' descriptions, transcriptions into other languages, and what happened in other Romance languages). But /ʝ/ came from Latin /j/, which was (almost?) always [j]. So it makes more sense to say that the approximant /j/ became a fricative /ʝ/ which sometimes becomes [ɟʝ], than to say that /j/ became /ɟʝ/ directly. In other words, [ʝ] is the most conservative form, while [ɟʝ] is more innovative. 

and it is clear that Alice is the recipient. But nowadays that would sound super old-fashioned. Another possibility is to use an article to mark the case: 

This is true only to a certain extent: it is quite frequently possible to choose between alternative constructions which use different cases and/or prepositions also, articles can be used to mark the case. So you can often avoid a case you don't like (like in English: use genitive 's or a construction with of). Also, there is some ambiguity due to cases looking the same (long example below). In practice, word order is a fall-back for guesstimating the meaning in situations where there is ambiguity with the cases. 

As I understood their analysis, they aimed to account for this fact by arguing that "have" can only extend event structure, not introduce new event structure. And because unaccusatives don't underlying have causation/agentivity, "have" in an unaccusative construction can only extend the event's endpoint, so the introduced argument must be interpreted as the experiencer/affectee. (I don't know if this quite gels with your observations about awareness. Except maybe that "ignorance is bliss" and in order to be an experiencer/affectee, you have to know about your misfortune?) As for other languages with similar predicates, they propose that the Japanese adversative -rare is similar to "have," but specified as extending the endpoint (hence the argument is always an experiencer/affectee), and that the French faire is similar to "have" but specified as extending the initial point (hence the argument is always a causer). There are also both benefactive and malefactive interpretations for some Salish applicatives (see, for example, Kiyosawa & Gerdts 2010. Some googling has also resulted in a book "Benefactives and malefactives: Typological perspectives and case studies" by Zuniga and Zeppo (2010). That might give you a good place to look for the crosslinguistic morphosyntactic properties of malefactives. Sorry I've got nothing on the diachronic question. Totally not my forté. Sorry also that I haven't read the later article by Ritter & Rosen (1997) - I'm not sure if they stick with their 1993 analysis, or change it. Some References: Ritter, E., & Rosen, S. T. (1993).

Here's an example where current and historic evolution of the language stands out quite prominently (and which is all about cases and extracting meaning and ambiguity): One point where the evolution to drop declination is mostly done are proper names which are not declinated any more: 

(Artice with name sounds decidedy southern) Nevertheless, there are still some remainders in every day language of the cases for names: it still feels really weird not to flex an adjective that is part of the name. E.g. I'd send my complaint der Deutschen Bahn (dative). But when I had a scholarship of the Telekom foundation, they insisted I should thank der Deutsche [no n] Telekom Stiftung as it is their proper name and should therefore stay nominative. They are ahead of me (and most other German native speakers) in dropping the cases. And that's the point where I think literary education comes in: classics of literature are usually slightly dated and therefore written in a language that is now perceived as old-fashioned. And even if we don't go back as far as Goethe, between concurrent constructions the fashion (= which is considered correct) can shift considerably within, say, a hundred years. Written texts will lag behind the developments of spoken language. Because a large body of read texts is actually older and also because this slightly dated body of text defines what is considered correct written language which also makes written language evolve slower than spoken language. I think at least for German, many constructions whichare considered appropriate for (educated) written texts would be perceived as old-fashioned in spoken langusage. Taking these two points together, my guess is: The perception of educated = using cases more correctly may just come from education = knowing classic texts, which are written in an old-fashioned way (seen from nowadays spoken language). If this happens while the language drops or changes cases, the natural lag between written texts and spoken language may be responsible for the perception This essay (Nübling 2012) cites a book that says in the 18th century, accussative and dative versions of names started to be considered vulgar and the upper classes dropped this flexion. So here we have a (historic) counter-example: less use of cases being considered more educated. It also cites Goethes "Leiden des jungen Werthers" (1774) loosing the genitive to "Leiden des jungen Werther" for the 2nd edition (1887). Or, actually: not loosing the genitive but switching from a doubly marked version (genitive article + genitive name) to the modern version where marking the case once (genitive article) is enough. 

The weres here are past subjunctive forms, even though there's nothing past-tense about the action: the general might have been here five minutes ago, but what's relevant is only that he isn't here now. This extends to other verbs as well: 

To supplement Nick's excellent answer: The mainstream view of PIE now is that it had no /a/ vowel (in the oldest stages we can reconstruct). Instead, it had three(*) "laryngeal" sounds, which weren't actually particularly laryngeal, but the name has stuck. They're conventionally written *h₁ *h₂ *h₃ and there are various theories as to their actual pronunciation: personally, I like the idea that they were /h x ɣʷ/, but there's not enough evidence to be sure. (*) Some people suggest that there were four or even five, but this hasn't caught on. But in every Indo-European language known at the time(**), these "laryngeals" never appeared directly. Instead, they only appeared as a "color" on the surrounding vowels. In other words, *h₁ *h₂ *h₃ first affected the surrounding vowels, then disappeared entirely. (**) Hittite was discovered after the laryngeal theory was proposed, and did actually show direct evidence of some laryngeals. Which adds quite a lot of evidence to the theory. In particular, *h₁ turned *e into *e (no change), *h₂ turned *e into *a, and *h₃ turned *e into *o. If the laryngeal came before the vowel, the result was short; if it came after the vowel, the result was long. So Wiktionary is showing the (more modern) reconstruction of older PIE, while the laryngeals still existed, and Etymonline is showing the (older) reconstruction of later PIE, after Hittite split off and the laryngeals vanished. Note, as the others have said, that Etymonline is also ignoring several important distinctions in PIE: *ǵ and *g are separate phonemes in every reconstruction I've seen, and there's significantly more evidence for them than there is for laryngeals. (See the centum-satem division for examples.) 

Strictly speaking, it is not clear who writes to whom: either Bob writes to Alice (and it is emphasized that the letter is to Alice as opposed to Dave), or Alice writes a letter to Bob. The latter will be the default assumption as word order is considered to resolve the ambiguity. The alternative is to put the preposition to make it unambiguous: 

Here's another really fancy example: Many of my well-educated friends would cite "trotz dem (Dativ)" as one of those examples how the dative construction is killing the genitive, and say it should be "trotz des (Genitiv)" (so would I have said before googling about this questoin...). But this blog talks about the opposite shift from dative to genitive just occurring in the 20th century. 

The numbers are specific to Proto-Indo-European. Scholars aren't sure how PIE was pronounced: after all, there are no native speakers around now, or records from the time. All of the sounds in reconstructed words are educated guesses at best. Some sounds were fairly easy to guess. For instance, there was a sound that seems to have become /t/ in most of PIE's descendants. Thus, it makes sense to call that sound *t. But others are harder to guess. The well-known linguist Ferdinand de Saussure argued that PIE needed a few extra sounds to explain all the evidence, sounds that didn't have direct reflexes in any Indo-European language known at the time. (Since then we've found one language which has reflexes for these sounds, which adds evidence to his theory.) He simply called these unknown sounds "coefficients sonantiques" and didn't speculate as to what they might have been. Since they were probably fricatives, and weak fricatives at that, people took to writing them all as *h. Except that there were three different ones. So with typical lack of creativity, they're now written *h₁, *h₂, and *h₃. There are various theories as to what they actually were, but the notation has become standard now and is unlikely to change. Personally, I'm fond of Rasmussen's claim that *h₁ was a glottal fricative (English "h"), *h₂ was a velar fricative, and *h₃ was a velar fricative with lip rounding. But many other linguists would disagree. Some say *h₁ was a glottal stop, others say *h₂ was uvular, and so on. In Semitic reconstruction, by the way, there was a similar problem: Semitic languages tend to have multiple sounds that are sort of like /h/, and it's not clear what the original forms were. So they're conventionally transliterated *h, *ḥ, *ẖ, *ḫ. The moral of the story is we really need better conventions for writing "h-like sounds". As far as the superscript w, that's standard linguistic notation for lip rounding ("secondary labial articulation"). PIE distinguished between velar consonants and rounded velar (aka labiovelar) consonants, roughly equivalent to the difference between English "keen" and "queen". Some transcriptions use a normal *w instead of the superscript, or even a *u; it's just a matter of style. (No matter which style is used, though, the rounded consonants are generally considered single phonemes, not clusters of a velar and a labial.) 

As a native German speaker (but no linguist) I'd also say that correct use of cases does not have too much to do with education. Kindergarden children will use e.g. the accusative correctly when asking for a toy. In fact, in a sentence like "Gib mir den Ball." incorrect use of cases would sound like a foreigner learning German but decidedly not like a child. But there is a (perceived) link between use of cases and education. But I think it is spurious (perceived only) in the sense that correlation is not causation. The first crucial point is: what defines correct use of a language? Language evolves, and the German language is possibly evolving towards fewer cases (English is ahead in that respect: currently only 1 1/2 or 2 cases left). German may also arrive at retaining only nominative and accusative*. The accusative example with the small child was not accidental in the sense that the "mistakes" with cases in everyday spoken German are typically avoidig genitive e.g. by a dative construction and accusative instead of dative. I put the mistake into quotation marks: is it a mistake if a large and growing proportion of the speakers use a new construction (or the relative frequencies of two constructions shift) or is it a very normal sign of an evolving language? Not to speak of dialects which may have used the "wrong" construction for hundreds of years. 

One idea about this is that there are multiple "levels" of language: there's the ideal Platonic representation of English in your mind (langue), and then at a different level it can be represented as written text or audible speech or Shavian transcription or... (parole). This is a very clean and elegant analysis, but there's also evidence that spoken and written language are different levels: infants learn to speak (or sign) significantly before they learn to write, for one. So written and spoken language are not entirely equivalent. 

Mereological theories of events usually assume that the domain of events forms a join semilattice with no bottom element.(Landman 2004's "Indefinites and the Type of Sets" is one of the few exceptions I've found.) There are probably good reasons that most researchers assume that there is no bottom element - i.e., I assume that there are negative consequences to assuming a bottom element, and that these have been discussed somewhere in the literature. What are some of these negative consequences? (Or where could I find a discussion of some of them?)
