No, reincarnation is not open to empirical validation: The problem of how life after death can be scientifically studied is not a simple one. Parapsychologists believe progress can be made in a scientific fashion, but they have received doubt both from the skeptic community and from sympathetic, neutral philosophers of science. It is this latter criticism I will focus on. The remainder of this answer is an extremely brief and hopefully accurate discussion of Michael Sudduth's new book A Philosophical Critique of Empirical Arguments for Postmortem Survival (Palgrave Macmillan, 2016). The example of Ian Stevenson's work on reincarnation is pretty straightforward: he proposes to simply find case studies of alleged reincarnations who possess factual information about their past lives that they couldn't have come across by normal means. This would seem to be evidence of some kind of paranormal activity, and indeed, much of the criticism of Stevenson has focused on trying to disprove his dozens of examples. However, what Stevenson provides is data, not a hypothesis. The "survival hypothesis," the statement "The soul survives death", does not cause us to expect any this-worldly phenomena in itself. We could be living in an orthodox Christian world where the future states of the soul do not affect us in any way. That doesn't make the claim unusual; according to the Durhem-Quine thesis, there are very few scientific claims that can be falsified by themselves. To restate Wikipedia's example, Galileo seeing rings around Jupiter could be explained by Jupiter being surrounded by a dozen small moons and thousands of tiny objects in a ring, or it could be explained by a scratch on the lens of Galileo's telescope, as one of the other intellectuals of the day suggested. So, a truer statement of Galileo's hypothesis is actually "Jupiter has rings and I can see them perfectly well through my telescope". The second half of this is called an auxiliary hypothesis. It's not essential to the main hypothesis but we need it to get from the data we currently have to the main hypothesis. Similarly, the survival hypothesis in a more testable form must make more specific claims that cause us to expect data, like "The soul survives death and goes to Heaven, and people can experience this themselves through near death experiences," or perhaps "The soul survives death, reincarnates sometimes on Earth, and retains at least some of its memories, and we can confirm this and rule out cold reading through carefully controlled interviews." The latter is closer to Stevenson's actual view. But we are not done with auxiliary hypotheses yet, because at some point they lose explanatory power. For example, if Stevenson were to narrow down his claim to "I myself spoke to a reincarnated person once, in a unique event that cannot be duplicated," that's not particularly helpful for our lives. In the more general form he gives in his books, Stevenson's claims can be explained in all sorts of other ways: 

It's been argued that God doesn't exist because there is so much evil in the world. For example, suppose a person is violently murdered - an innocent child say. They argue, God could have prevented that but He didn't, therefore He does not exist. Are there any good counter arguments to this position? 

Kant criticized Anselm's argument for the existence of God by counter arguing the expression 'God exists' adds nothing to our meaning of God and so it cannot be true a God that exists is greater than a god that does not exist. Yet, modern atheists, most frequently say such things as unicorns, dragons, fairies, ghosts, the great pumpkin, etc. do not exist. So it seems existence is a predicate according to them. Why is existence not a true predicate with respect to Anselm's argument? What is the main difficulty with his argument besides Kant's criticism? 

Suppose I take any finite length and subtract half of it continuously. So the size of the remainder, after each subtraction, is equal to its original length multiplied by one half taken to the nth power, where n is the number of subtractions. (e.g. 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32,...). Now with each subtraction of a half, the size of the remainder decreases, and as the original length is finite, it should eventually diminish to nothing. That would agree with the concept of a mathematical limit, because the limit of this sequence or exponential function, as the number of subtractions tends to infinity (i.e. n), is zero. Here is the difficulty I'm having, each subtraction always leaves exactly one half of the previous remainder, thus it cannot actually disappear altogether or the finial subtraction would be complete removal and not subtraction of a half. This is, loosely, Zeno of Elea's argument against motion. In this case, I'm asking when does the remainder of something, after many subtractions from it, still exist? 

Helen Keller lost her senses of both sight and hearing at a very young age. She was described as being an "animal". While her teacher, Annie Sullivan, held her hands under a water pump, the young girl realized the sign language impressed into her palm by her teacher were words. Certainly her experience of consciousness depended, at least in part, upon her available sense impressions. A being, like a bat, experiences consciousness differently than we do because they "see" with their ears. But to answer your question, if I lost all my senses, I would be in a vegetative state, in much the same way a person put under a general anaesthetic experiences nothing. In my opinion, consciousness does depend on the sense impressions and the mind is nothing without them. 

Newcomb's problem might help us understand our difficulties between freewill and determinism. There are two boxes; one box is opaque and the other is translucent. In the translucent box is one thousand pounds. The opaque box contains either a million pounds or nothing. There is an omniscient being capable of accurately predicting our choice before we execute it. If the being predicts we shall take only the contents of the opaque box, there shall be one million pounds in it for us to share. However, if we select the contents of both boxes, there will be nothing in the opaque box. According to the principle of maximizing expected utility, we should select only the contents of the opaque box and leave the other one alone. However, according to the principle of dominance, we should select the contents of both boxes because our action occurs after the contents of both boxes are already set up by the predictor. Here is the difficulty with the principle of maximizing expected utility: Suppose we decide to take the contents of only the opaque box. As we walk away with our loot, we look back at the transparent box and realize there is a thousand pounds in it. What is stopping us from going back and taking it? After all, we already received the million pounds and the thousand pounds in the translucent box just cannot disappear into thin air and we would also prove the predictor is unreliable. Suppose, we open the contents of just the opaque box and find nothing, then we can just leave the other box alone, it's just a paltry thousand pounds, to prove the predictor is unreliable. So, an omniscient being capable of accurately predicting our actions, in a deterministic universe, can easily be shown as being unreliable by doing as outlined above. I believe we have freewill (determinism doesn't pass muster), as we are able to outwit an omniscient being. 

The term "conspiracy theory" was invented by Karl Popper as a way to describe Marxist theories of history as a collusion of the bourgeoise class against the working class. So, as far as I can tell, someone actually arguing after Popper would say Marxists are actually seeing the world in a similar way to people who claim that climate change is a hoax, vaccines are poisonous, historical world leaders are reptilian, etc. by placing the motives of large groups of people in an "open society" under suspicion. From my perspective, regardless of value judgments about conspiracy theory, the entire "hermeneutics of suspicion" fits the category. Nietzsche's historical thesis is largely a conspiracy theory about the nature of Christianity, and many popular writers have interpreted it as such. Alex Jones claiming that "there's a war on for your mind" is being very legitimately Freudian. However, when I went to read the academic literature on this, I found that this view is in a distinct minority. Placing, say, governments, doctors, or environmentalists under suspicion is considered a "conspiracy theory," but Marx, Nietzsche and Freud are not generally claimed to be "conspiracy theorists." There are only a few sources that make such a claim, and they appear to be on the fringes of academic philosophy. I was unable to find any critical literature examining the difference between the hermeneutics of suspicion and conspiracy theory. I would appreciate any book recommendations, no matter how heavy. 

Children like making up stories and sometimes hit on several real facts about other people through totally random chance. Children can access the memories of relatives of a deceased person through some unknown mechanism. (Living psi) Memories drift around in the ether at death and sometimes fall into other people's heads totally independent of the question of survival of the soul. (René Guénon's "psychic residues") Stevenson was systematically deceived by his interpreters, or for some other reason didn't see what he thought he saw. (Cartesian demon) Regardless of what country you're in, for some reason -- pursuit of fame, confirmation of community beliefs, etc. -- people have a strong inclination to fake reincarnation-like incidents. 

None of these alternative explanations actually falsify the claim "The soul survives death, reincarnates sometimes on Earth, and retains at least some of its memories, and we can confirm this and rule out cold reading through carefully controlled interviews." They just tell us we haven't truly tested it yet. But alas, that tells us that we need additional auxiliary hypotheses which reduce the explanatory power of the survival hypothesis so much that there's no particular reason to accept it as an explanation of Stevenson's data over any of the other hypotheses. In particular the living psi hypothesis would seem to cover any anomalous data that could possibly be claimed to support the survival hypothesis. So according to Michael Sudduth's book, the argument that "the soul survives death" necessarily has no explanatory power, regardless of the more specific data it is meant to analyze, or the specific test meant to prove or disprove it. There is no way to state it in a way that becomes scientifically valuable. Sudduth concludes that the survival hypothesis is not a scientific hypothesis, meaning that it can't be evaluated empirically. This is the problem with much of parapsychology: experiments may suggest to a reader that something weird is going on, but it's hard to turn "something weird" into a scientific hypothesis, especially when it's an anomaly that is not systematically reproducible and varies its nature widely between experiments. Such deficiencies reduce the explanatory power of any hypothesis significantly. 

Conversing with friends, and even perceived enemies, are company. Very few people can stand being alone for long (even Sartre didn't like being alone). Good friends and loved ones, worthy of trust, can be comforting when nasty things happen (e.g. violence, war, massacre, crime, illness, insanity, hatred and so on). 

The only even number that is prime is the number two, and all other prime numbers are odd. It is true because an evil demon, as Descartes proposed, could not make me go wrong in believing this incorrect. It's, dare I say, categorically true. 

(5 x 11111...)/(6 x 11111...) is not equal to 5/6 (5 x 11111...) equals infinity and (6 x 11111...) equals infinity. (infinity)/(infinity) is always undefined. The obscure nature of Pythagoras' School makes it hard to know who discovered irrational numbers (Hippasus?). They probably found the difficulty while examining a right triangle whose sides a and b are both equal to one. Perhaps, to their horror, they found the number two is not a perfect square (e.g. 4, 9, 16, ... are perfect squares and render an integer when their square root is taken). Pythagoras reasoned 'all is numbers' and also, that for any right triangle, the squares of sides a and b is exactly equal to the square of its hypotenuse (line c), but this can be said another way, the square erected on the diagonal of a square has twice the area of the original square. The difficulty they had was trying to create a ratio of two integers that would account for the square root of two. They tried and tried and tried, and they couldn't find such a ratio. Someone (Euclid?) later proved such a ratio does not exist. (The Presocratics, Philip Wheelwright (Editor), 1997, p.206). 

Consider the following, "if A then B" implies "A only if B". For example, take "if it is raining, the sidewalk will be wet,". Therefore, "it is raining only if the sidewalk is wet." The first expression is straightforward, but what about the second? Only if the sidewalk is wet, is it possible it is raining. This does not mean other things, such as a water hose, cannot make the sidewalk wet, rather if it's wet, only then is it possible it is raining. So, what is the relationship between "if A then B" and "A only if B"? In other words, does the first expression guarantee the truth of the second? 

The prisoners in the cave are just ordinary human beings; whether or not they have free will is another question in philosophy. The point behind the "allegory of the cave" is the prisoners believe the projection screen in front of them is real, in much the same way a motion picture appears real. One day a prisoner escapes and discovers the world is much larger and more unusual that he had thought. He returns to the cave to share this knowledge with the other prisoners. They just laugh at him and think he has gone mad.
