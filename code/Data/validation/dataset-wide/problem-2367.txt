You will then follow the red trail through Karlík valley and Mořinka all the way to Karlštejn. The castle in Karlštejn is a very popular tourist attraction, and can be pretty crowded. Most visitors take a train or bus to the village, and climb the souvenir shop encrusted road up to the castle. The red trail will bring you to the castle from different side. You will still have to pass through some of the madness, but you will avoid the worst. You can visit the castle if you want. Then continue on the red trail past the castle. Keep following the red trail till you get to an intersection of several trails called "Propadlé Vody". From there you have number of options, but my favorite always was to take the yellow trail to the north, marked on the map as "Svatojánský okruh" (St. John circle). It will take you past the Arnika cave, through some interesting long abandoned limestone quarries all the way to a vist point on the top of the cliff overlooking the St. John valley and the monastery. Bacrtacking a bit and following the trail further will take you down to the valley. From there, you have several options. You can take the blue trail north and catch a train or bus in Vráž. You can stay on the red trail and end up in the city of Beroun, with several options for transportation back tp Prague. Or you can take the yellow trail south to Srbsko, where you can take a train back to Prague. If you want to hike more, you have a number of options, including those: 

Tent: A 2 person tent divides up really well between Tent/rainfly, and poles/groundcloth, a 4 person tent breaks down each component even more. Share with a bigger tent and you should be good to go Sleeping Bag: Go in the summer months, when the temperature will be warm. I live in the Mid-Atlantic, and typically take an Army Surplus Poncho liner as my sleeping bag on trips in the late spring-early fall. In the height of summer, I bring a cotton sheet (I know, cotton is bad, but it's all I got). Sleeping Pad: If you are careful about your sleeping spot you don't need one of these. However, it's always the first "luxury" item that I pack. I won't camp without my mattress. If you can, however, I'd loan mine to the newbie friend, or use a spare/borrow one from a friend. Stove: Most backpacking food reads like: Boil X volume water. Add powder. Stir. Let sit Y minutes. Plan to share food/utensils, and you should be good to go. Food: Again, double up and plan to cook/eat 2 person meals instead of 2-1 person meals. Eating Utensils: All the friend would need is the bowl and spoon. Bowls can be repurposed from frozen dessert topping containers, large butter/margarine tubs, etc. Sure, it will fall apart after a few uses, but you can't beat the price Water Bottles: If you know anyone who beverages out of plastic bottles, collect and reuse them. Wash them out and use as water bottles. I've personally used 1 liter soda bottles for months before they wear out. Best part, it's free (assuming you'd drink the soda/water/juice to begin with). Backpack: Either borrow a full pack from a friend, or pack as much as you can in your pack and have him bring along the biggest backpack (daypack) he has. Alternate days. One final note: You can rent almost all the gear needed from a local REI. I'm not sure if you need to be a member (recommended if you will be buying a lot of gear), or if they will rent to Joe Public, but worth looking into. 

I made myself a simple wood burning stove from a small tomato can, and I am pretty happy with it, but now I am wondering if I would get significantly increased performance by making a more complicated double wall "bushbuddy" style stove. Does anybody have any experience with DIY double wall wood burning stoves? Is there enough increase in performance to justify the more complicated design? 

To get some idea what you can see in Brdy, you can look at this site. Another great area for hiking, less hilly but perhaps more interesting, is just on the other side of the Berounka river. The "Český Kras" (Bohemian Karst) is somewhat more popular and can be, at least in some areas, quite crowded, but if you avaid the most obvious tourist attractions, you can find some excellent hinkng. Again, there is a number of ways how to get there: 

Take a regular rectangular tarp, lay it out such that it is as close to the tent's size as possible. Then take any amount of extra that is on the UPHILL SIDE, and fold UNDER THE TARP any excess. Any water that comes downhill is then channeled underneath the groundcloth. 

If you put down a ground tarp that is significantly larger than the tent (and by significant I mean more than an inch or so), tuck any extra under the tent, otherwise rain will hit the tarp and then go straight to the tent-floor, opening the door for tent-floods. I have never put a tarp inside a tent, but I have also never had an issue with tent-flooding once I learned to tarp outside and tuck under. 

I spent some time in a wigwam today, and due to the wind conditions, it was very difficult to keep the smoke out. Are there some tricks one can use in a situation like that to make the wigwam more habitable, or to deal with the smoke in some way? 

I have used hexamine fuel in sub-freezing temperatures before, and my experience is that it works reasonably well if you keep your stove protected from the wind. In cold weather it will take several cubes to get your water boiling. You really need to keep the stove protected from wind, though, even in warm weather, the flame gets blown off pretty easily. 

They are usually found on trees, rocks or buildings, and can look like this. At places where the trail changes direction, it is often marked using an arrow version of the mark: 

know if you will be going through marshy areas. If you are hiking in the Everglades, pack more socks than if you will be hiking through the Sahara. If you have to cross a river, try to not cross in your boots. There is a favorite trail in my area, and it ends with crossing a waist-deep river. I'll drop pack, change into my trail-sandals, stuff the socks into my boots and tie them onto my pack. After that crossing, I typically don't change back as the car is less than 1/4 mile away, but otherwise I would change back to boots on the other side of the river. In wet areas (lots of stream crossings, or squishy trails), every rest stop starts with taking off the boots, removing the insoles and taking off socks. Everything goes into the sun, while I'm resting in the shady. If my feet are still wet towards the end of the break, I'll wipe down my feet with a bandana before getting put back together. In general conditions, I'll 2 pairs of liners, 2 pairs of outer socks, and will alternate between days. However, if there will be a day 7 of walking, I'll bring an extra pair of liners and outer socks which will then enter the rotation somewhere around day 5. Hang yesterday/tomorrow's socks on the outside of your pack to help them dry. You could easily skip the extra liners since they tend to dry as quickly as you can pull them out of wash-water. if all else fails, you could take a day with short miles and hike in your "in camp" shoes which should be dry and will help your boots/socks dry. 

Now, back to hiking opportunities near Prague. There are actually several shorter but nice hikes. One of them is the "Prokopské valley". You can either take a bus to the Zlíchov station and take the blue trail up to the valley, or, from Jinonice subway station, yellow and green trails both go down. The valley has a number of interesting geological features. Other interesting areas are "Modřanská rokle" on the other side of the river, area around Roztoky and Suchdol in the north, the Botič valley in the east, and several other smaller areas. These are all shorter hikes, partly through urban or suburban environment, but can be quite nice. For longer hikes, and more natural ones, I recommend the region in the south of Prague. It is more hilly, with some prety good hiking. Probably the most mountain like part of this region is the area called Brdy. It is a range of wooded hills that stretch from the southern edge of Prague for some 50 or 60 km south west past Příbram. Unfortunately the central part of this range belongs to the military and is mostly closed to the public, but the northern part has some very nice hiking. There are several ways how to get there from Prague:
