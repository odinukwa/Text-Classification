I have a wiper motor from some car or van that has a shaft on it. When I apply 12 volts to it, with no load on it, it seems to spin at about 125 RPMs. I vaguely remember that when I load it, it can draw up to about 10 amps (10A). I suspect it can output maybe 100 watts of power or so. It also has 3 mounting holes. I suspect someone mechanically inclined could perhaps connect this with 1:1 ratio to the crank/chainring assembly. The 125 RPMs would likely drop under load but under low load it should maintain close to that I would think. It would be fun to try it with some type of freewheel mechanism or centrifugal clutch so when the motor is turned off, it would not load the cranks. Since the rotational speed mimics a normal cadence (probably will drop to 60 to 100 RPMs under load), it can possibly be used to run a multispeed bike and if the rider pedals too, they would help each other out (like 100 watt motor plus 100 watt rider = 200 watts total). So has anyone ever tried this and do you think it could work and if you think so, do you think it would work well? What about pitfalls? UPDATE: I tried the motor with a 12V battery and a short crescent wrench and I was able to hold the wrench still but there was a fair amount of tug on it, meaning it might be ok as a helper motor but not strong enough to move the bike on its own. It would be interesting to see if after getting the bike going say 10 MPH, if this motor would at maintain that speed or at least help the bike to coast down longer. Also since it spins at about 125 RPMs, it can be geared down even more such as thru a 16T drive sprocket and a 20T driven sprocket which is a a 4:5 reduction so then about 100 RPMs, giving it more torque. I think if this motor spun at half the speed, it would be harder for me to hold that wrench still. Maybe some other wiper motors spin slower like 60-100 RPMs. Thank you. 

In the situation you describe it sounds like there is no time to stop. The next best option has to be riding around the snake toward its tail, because snakes (like most animals, apart from humans on bike paths) mostly move forward. If you're going fast and significantly altering course would risk you falling on the ground (near the snake!), just hold your line. If you're confident and skilled enough, you can bunnyhop to avoid injuring it. I think that's about the sum of what you have time to do in a close-quarters situation at speed. A big part of the outcome is--for better or worse--dependent on the snake. 

Most likely yes, the M772 will work. As you have already calculated, the capacity is within spec, and the maximum sprocket size is out of range by just 2 teeth. In my experience this is very likely to work, so long as the rear dropout on your frame is not especially near to the axle, and so long as you tighten the "B screw" more than normal with a smaller cassette. Whatever you do, don't buy a "Dyna-Sys" model, because they aren't compatible with your shifters. This rules out the M780. Also note that with the super-low gear of 30x36, you do somewhat increase the chances of breaking a rear spoke (or the chain) if you put a large amount of force into the pedals with such low gearing. This isn't a big concern, but don't get carried away with it unless your body weight is quite low. 

I have an old cable from a 7 speed Torpedo internal hub and am wondering if it will properly index a modern day 7 speed freewheel or if it is way off. Is there an easy way to check this? Just measure how far the cable moves in it vs. how far the cable moves is my twist (grip) shifter 7 speed? 

Notice that the 15 cog repeats cuz the difference between the 36 and 44 chainrings is close enough to 20%. Also notice the overall spread of the gears is a very wide 8 with a very low 1st gear (0.5) and a reasonably tall high gear (4.0). That should cover almost any situation for the average rider. 

When I first got my bike, I had the saddle too low and I experienced some pain in my right knee while riding. I seem to have "fixed" this problem by raising it some. However, that got me thinking... what would happen if I raised it even more so that my legs would be straight (not bent at the knee) when the pedal was at the bottom? Would this give me increased power? Have power tests been done to verify what level of leg extension produces the most power? Are there any problems allowing your leg to fully extend (straighten)? I may try this sometime but wanted to get some info here first. I asked someone at the local bikeshop and they told me there is a chance of hyperextending if I do that but I asked myself how if the position is fixed? I think the general rule is to have a little bit of knee flex while the pedal is at the bottom but maybe that is a guideline and not a "hard" rule. I wanted to add that I don't use any fancy riding shoes or any clips. Just regular "street" shoes. Also, my typical longest ride in a single day is only about 10 miles max. That translates into about a little over 1 hour at an average speed of less than 10 MPH. Also, I am not sure why some people might say it is "bad" to straighten your leg totally when riding cuz when we walk we have alternating straight legs so why not the same when we ride a bike? When we lift a heavy object off of the floor, the hardest part is when our legs are bent the most, indicating that is the most inefficient position. When our legs are nearly straight it is much easier for us to lift weight such as a heavy box that is already at waist height for us. 

From here: $URL$ You can get them with different kinds of hooks on the ends, depending on what you have to attach them to. If you remove the flag and perhaps the front "tongue" frame (which attaches to your bike), the rest of it should be no problem to secure on top of the car. You could also remove the rear wheel to get a lower profile for the whole thing (then put the wheel in the car). If you keep the wheel mounted, tie a strap through it so it can't spin in the wind. 

Replace your RD-6700-GS derailleur with an XT M771 SGS "9 speed" (also works with 10) rear derailleur. It is important that the new derailleur is NOT labeled "Dyna-Sys" (which won't work). This has a "capacity" of 45 teeth; your front big/small rings are 50/30t (n.b. you also mentioned 52t, not sure which is right). So of the 45 tooth capacity you use 20 in the front, leaving 25 for the rear. That means you can use an 11-36 cassette, which would be a huge improvement (20% gear reduction vs your 30t). Total cost around $120-160 (derailleur, cassette, chain). Replace your crankset. This is problematic because MTB front derailleurs are not compatible with your road shifter. You'd probably need to use a bar-end shifter instead, which is not expensive but might not be to your liking if you use the front shifter a lot. You could use an XT crankset and get down to say 24t instead of your existing 30t. But you'll lose some top-end gears. Total cost around $150-400 (crankset, derailleur, shifter, chain). 

I say it is both possible and practical. If someone really wants the crawler gear then this is a way to get it without having to resort to other methods such as a double gear reduction (chainring and cogs being only 1 reduction then adding some other one). If someone ever tries this then please report back. I would love to have a bike with this isolated very low gear so then I could just use reasonable size cogs and chainrings. 

I tried to research this online but didn't see any examples of this exact concern, which is if I gear down a very cheap mountain bike that has a 7 speed freewheel, do I run the risk of creating so much torque magnification that something bad could happen? Is it possible that something could break from the high torque? What about if and when I need to remove the freewheel? Might it be stuck from the high torque pedaling in the lowest gear? Stock lowest gear is 24/28 and I will attempt either 20/28, 24/34, or 20/34 which is about 15.3 gear inches. I ride mostly on the street at a slow pace (about 10 MPH average) but I also like to ride thru grass slowly and even in grass uphills so I put a good deal of force on the pedals in that situation. 

Trek used to make only "WSD" versions of the same model names sold "for men." But things aren't that simple anymore! What's the men's version of the Lexa SLX? 

Five to eight years seems reasonable. See here: $URL$ - some helmet makers recommend somewhere in this range, and longer than eight years you start to see deterioration from sun damage, occasional knocks, etc. My last helmet lasted only four years in high-UV riding, about 15,000 km total, before the plastic strap around the back simply cracked in half. This didn't make it 100% useless or ineffective, but it surely prompted replacement. But this was a lot of riding, mostly in bright sun and high temperatures. 

I'd use a trailer for this. There are ready-made ones like $URL$ or you could build your own. Then a lot of the weight can go onto a dedicated trailer wheel (or two), which should make it no big deal to carry two 60 pound batteries (assuming you have legs of steel, obviously). 

Here is what I have for a progressive 3x9 setup using all 3 chainrings and all 9 cogs but using only 3 cogs per chainring. chainrings (20,30,40) cogs : (36,28,22,25,20,16,18,15,12) Ratios would then be: 

I read somewhere that steady cadence is a good thing but why is that? It is analogous to running long distance where it is a good idea to set a reasonable pace and stick to it? I would think that varying your cadence would give your muscles a chance to rest some. I question whether the original claim is actually true. I would think it would be more efficient to accelerate briskly then coast down, then repeat. This "sawtooth" cadence question is interesting because with a car or motorcycle, you actually get better gas mileage if you accelerate briskly and then just coast down. For example, you are at a red light in pole position (first). The light then turns green. You then accelerate quickly up to the speed limit (say 50 MPH) and then let the car/motorcycle coast down to maybe 20 MPH and then repeat. This is actually more efficient (you will use less gasoline) than if you accelerated slowly and maintained the 50 mph. This has already been confirmed by many people that have tested it. It is also easy to confirm yourself, especially if you have a real time mileage display. It will be at maybe 10 MPG for a brief time while you accelerate then vary between 99 and and some lower number as you coast down. Ok now to bikes. It seems to make sense that for a bike a similar thing should happen. Imagine a person pedaling an average bicycle 10 MPH on level ground with no wind. The amount of energy expended by the rider depends on several factors including what gear they are in. Imagine they are in the proper gear vs. much too tall (high) a gear vs. much too short (low) a gear. Problem is in the low gear energy is being wasting pedaling faster than is needed (for example 150 cadence). This is a "subpoint" I am trying to make related to the main point of "sawtooth" cadence I am working up to. If I pedal 10 miles at 10 MPH at near constant cadence, that will be 1 hour straight on pedaling. How can my muscles ever get a rest? Compare that to pedaling up to 20 MPH quickly (briskly) and then coasting down to 3 MPH and then repeating. Here I use my muscles for a quick burst then spend most of my time coasting. Here my muscles get a good rest and the number of actual crank rotations is far less. 10 miles on my bike in my favorite middle gear (34/20=1.7) with my 26" diameter tires would require about 4500 crank turns. I suspect using the sawtooth cadence method would require far less, possible only 1/3rd or about 1500. It would be an interesting test to have someone make the trip using both techniques and report their level on fatigue afterwards. Someone mentioned about pedaling then coasting a lot will make me look like a kid on a BMX bike. Well kids are generally lazy. Maybe they figured out it is easier to pedal and coast so that is why they do it. Another analogy is at my workplace. Can I get more work done if I work hard but take several breaks or if I just work straight thru without breaks but I get more tired that way? For me, I need the breaks to stay productive. Maybe for younger riders a steady cadence is better but I am wondering for the 50+ crowd if sawtooth is actually better. I suspect it is. 

The frame is 100% trash. Do not attempt to use it at all. What you can do is to carefully remove everything from the frame. Discard the frame, and now you have a whole bunch of valuable parts. You can either buy a new (possibly second hand) frame, or just sell the parts to finance the purchase of another bike. There are a few parts you won't be able to easily remove, such as the headset and the bottom bracket, but these are not very valuable anyway, so don't worry about buying the special tools for those. 

They usually keep the bike narrow, suitable for trail riding where branches might snag panniers. They use soft attachments (usually), so extreme vibration doesn't make undue noise or wear things out. There are people with damaged racks simply from plastic pannier clips bumping along on them for months on end. Cheap "bikepacking" (with scare quotes) bags are cheaper than cheap panniers plus cheap racks. Bikepacking bags also help packrats reduce their load, simply by being more constrained than large panniers. They're also suitable for rental bikes, when you're away from home. 

I had an idea. Why not space gears on a bike the same as musical notes? For example, in music, if you start on a certain note (let's say C3), you need to go up 12 more half steps (notes) to get to C4, an octave above C3. The frequency of C4 vs. C3 is exactly double. The notes are spaced with intervals of 2 ^ (1/12) which is about 1.06. So for a 12 speed bike, you would have 12 closely spaced gears which you could shift individually if you need close ratio or in pairs if you want more normal 12% spacing. When you run thru all those gears you could then flick a doubler gear (maybe located in the bottom bracket) that then doubles all the ratios and then you repeat all of those 12 gears again in order. There would also be a doubler gear in the hub. So for example, in the low mode, you can have gears 0.50 to 0.94 Engage one doubler (either one) and you get 1.00 to 1.92, engage both doublers and you get 2.00 to 3.84. Notice there is no overlap in the gears. you will basically have a progressive 36 speed with the option to shift 2 gears at a time (skipping gears) if you want 12% between gears and thus making it a progressive 18 speed. More likely is you would pick a range (low, med, or high) and use it as a close ratio 12 speed. You could even use it as a super wide range (4:1) 3 speed. Just pick a middle cog for example with the halving gear enabled, spin that out then disable it, thus doubling your gear. After spinning that out actuate the doubler gear and you can go fast. You can control the overall range by changing the single front sprocket. For example, 36T could start you out at 0.50 in the low gear but maxes out at 3.84. If you prefer taller you could run a 45T so you start out at 0.625:1 and top out at 5.00:1. (135 gear inches on a 27" diameter tire). Also since the gear changes between the 3 ranges are from one end of the shifter (12) to the other (1), you can just twist the shifter quickly, eliminating the need for a precision shift like in a 3x9 progressive shift attempt where you have to "bounce" between chainrings and cogs. So here is my 1st attempt at getting close to 6% between gears using cogs: 36, 34, 32, 30, 29, 27, 25, 24, 23, 21, 20, 19. I know for me, I would spend a lot of time in the middle range (1.00 to 1.92) and would love to have the close ratios for when I get a headwind. What sometimes happens is I would shift from a 16T cog to an 18T but what I really needed is a 17T. Well my new gearing system would handle that cuz you can shift from a 32T to 34T which is same as going from 16T to 17T as far as gear ratio. So is this a good enough idea for someone to build this bike? What would be the drawbacks of it? Might the efficiency go down significantly with the triple gear setup or should it be ok? Note that on motorcycles, only about 85% of the power of the engine makes it to the rear wheel so I would think if a bike is 85% or better that is acceptable with 90+% being a target. Correction: one will be a halving gear and the other would be a doubling gear. With both disabled (bypassed), the bike would be in the midrange gears (1.00 to 1.92 for example). Front sprocket would be size 36T to get midrange to start out at 1.00 (36/36) but of course roadies can adjust larger such as 45T and mountain bikers can adjust lower such as 32T or even 30T. Extreme hill climbers that want a 7.5" gear (27" diameter tires) would need a 0.278:1 low gear which can be had by replacing the 36T front sprocket with a 20T. Even with that ultra low first gear, shifting to the highest gear would give about 60 gear inches which is good enough for cruising around. 

There is no specific way to calculate the worth of a frame when taken from a complete bicycle. The market will tell you how much it wants to pay for such a frame, but the theoretical calculation of "The frame is worth the complete bike price minus the price of all other components'" is wrong. Firstly it's wrong because it ignores assembly and value-add pricing. Secondly it's wrong because it ignores the steep discount you get when buying a complete bike. Imagine asking how much the chassis of a Ford Explorer is worth. If you try to buy all the other parts separately, the total will be more than double what a complete vehicle would cost. Bikes are a bit like that. 

It doesn't matter a lot if it's slightly off. But you should be able to center the calipers by hand, even after the mounting bolt is tightened. Just grasp the two brake arms firmly and rotate the entire caliper a bit (with no pressure applied to the brake lever). In my experience this is usually sufficient to get the caliper centered enough. Riding for a while will sometimes help center them as well. 

I was wondering instead of a long cage rear dearailleur (RD), what would happen if 2 rear short cage RDs were used instead? I realize the 2nd one might cause some mounting issues but assuming there was a proper bracket to hold it in place, could they somehow be synchronized to pad out or take up similar amounts of chain but about half each so they don't need to angle as much as a single? For example, if the same cable passed to both of them but there were calibrated to shift one rear cog each laterally, but individually would only take up or pad out enough chain for half a shift, so that combined they would make a complete shift but with half the travel/deflection or whatever the proper term is when it moves. If they were both identical RDs (with same spring tension), would they automatically share the chain takeup/padout equally (half each) or would the system be biased more towards one than the other? I am not suggesting this is a good thing to try. I am just asking if it is possible and what problems may occur as a result and if it would actually work.
