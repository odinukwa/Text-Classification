By request, these are the two previous questions in this "series": Low Voltage Lightning and Alien Nitrogen How To Make Lightning I recently asked a question about lightning storms on planets. One of the answers mentioned the idea of lightning between planets, and whilst I don't think that itself is feasible, I am going for a "Pirates of the Caribbean IN SPACE!" kind of feel to it and there's nothing better in a pirate story than stormy weather but I do want to stick to REAL science as much as possible. Some of the more detailed answers to my planetary lightning question suggested that dust, sandstorms, and ash could be used to generate lightning. Would a nebula, possibly artificial in nature, could be dense enough to create sparks in a vacuum? Is there an easier way to create "space storms" by natural or artificial means? If you come up with a decent estimate for density I'd also, ideally, like some sort of idea of what this would look like. Would you be able to see through it like a thick fog? Or would it be so dense that you couldn't see your own hand? The idea of a space battle surrounded by lightning and compounded by the inability to see, is very appealing to me but as I've said, I want this to be as real as possible. Maths is appreciated but not required. Thanks for reading. 

There was once an australopithecine called Paranthropus Robustus. It was slightly smaller than the reigning hominid at the time, and was driven extinct by habitat loss. Had it survived, and had evolutionary growth similar to hominids, the creature would be slightly smaller than modern humans. Seeing as Paranthropus was a herbivore, it wouldn't be able to obtain the large amount of brain fat necessary to compete with humans. Thusly, it would likely evolve a larger stature and become an expert at hiding from humans, who had vastly superior technology. These adaptations would have all taken place by the middle ages. Considering the areas where these beings live (according to mythology) are not the ones containing the most technologically advanced humans at this point, it would have a perfect place to live without too many consequences if they were found. Interestingly, these places are still fairly to extremely isolated, so the only humans they would have contact with are lone backpackers. It would be interesting to see the instinctive behaviors of this species (e.g. avoiding certain areas like hiking trails, specific caves, parts of Mount Everest.) 

Wind comes from convection in air, i.e. when cold air (for instance, over a sea) meets hot air (for instance, land.). Given that, in your world, there is both a northern and southern sea, there would probably be winds blowing from the north and south, converging along the equator. This would create a continuous high pressure zone over the equator. 

I have a race of very non-humanoid aliens, let's call them Zoblings, and they find an English Dictionary. These aliens are being oppressed and exploited as a resource by the humans because they don't realise they are dealing with intelligent creatures. During a raid the Zoblings find an English Dictionary. Given that they can recognise that these symbols have meaning to the Humans, could they learn to at least write in English without the aid of a human? 

I am running a sci-fi RPG. One of my players (the Engineer) has expressed interest in having a gold hammer. This seems pretty ridiculous to me as gold is soft and softness doesn't seem like a quality you'd look for in a hammer. However, this got me thinking, are there any types of tool used nowadays or possibly in the future where gold could be a primary material? 

Up front, I am aware of this question. My question is more about the material than the style and is not a duplicate. I was thinking about the clothing for my homebrew RPG and something about my intrepid band of space traders exploring the ice planet "Yetika" dressed in thick wool/leather coats appeals to me. This question is in two parts: 

The phoenix has fireproof epithelial tissue, and a microbiome made up entirely of archae evolved for surviving massive temperature fluctuations. The phoenix has a special organ where it ignites methane, which is a byproduct of digestion. When the phoenix is infected by a parasite or bacterial/viral infection, it bursts into flames, killing the infection. The phoenix also has an incredibly long natural lifespan, so it can survive for centuries if nothing kills it. 

In your universe, people can move planets. By nature of this being possible, you can build some AWESOME weapons. One I would suggest is the "planetary nutcracker" concept, where you move two planets on the opposite sides of a fleet or planet, and launch them towards each other. Given the size of the ships involved, and that they use fusion as power, the bombers themselves are effective weapons. You might be better off shooting a gutted one of those at the enemy. 

Consider this. A talisman is not an object in the way that a pocketwatch is an object. The talisman is both an object and a "feel". A person can have a "feel" for making talismans, but this person would have no "feel" for anything else. The talisman-maker would not make talismans by enchanting any random object, the talisman-maker would instead, for instance, make a fire talisman by burning rowan wood and pouring the ashes into a hollow ring with a stone of obsidan. The mage in question would be able to make as many talismans as necessary, but would have to own the required ingredients for a spell, AND have a "feel" for talisman-making. Unlike spells, talismans would be reusable, and the magic would never decay. An interesting possibility for this would be to have an ancient, utopian civilization that existed for thousands of years before falling to conquering outsiders. During their reign, they made some of the most powerful talismans the world ever has or will see. If these include time or mind control talismans, they will be sought after by every person in your world. 

Engineer your Gas Giant Differently: Most Gas Giants are made mostly of Helium and Hydrogen. This is a problem, as other answers have discussed, because they are the two lightest chemical elements known to man. However, if you had an unusual or constructed Gas Giant made mostly of Xenon and Neon for example, lifting gasses would be far more effective. Engineer Your Cruise Vehicle Differently: Buoyancy may not be powerful enough to keep "afloat" in most Gas Giants but other methods of aeronautics also still work. Lifting bodies like wings are viable, if less effective, in these environments. Also possible in this environment are jets and propellers. They are also less effective due to the dense atmosphere but this can be mitigated with speculative engineering (not speculative science). If you make your intakes very large and have the technology for the few particles going thorough your engine to exit at a very high speed then that will offset the lack of atmosphere. Also, since the atmosphere of Jupiter is contains a number of Hydrocarbons and even Space Shuttle Fuel (Hydrazine), it may be possible to get the air flowing through the engine to a high enough temperature and pressure to ignite them. By combining all three of these ideas you can imagine a huge B2 Bomber shaped thing with large ducted jets built flush into the fuselage. If you fill most of the wings with low pressure Hydrogen/Helium and build your radiators inside the wings so that the waste heat from your ship heats up the lifting gas, you may well be on to a winner. 

Allow me to also answer on a 'magical' stand point. First, the one who want to mapping the world must be someone who is able/mastering the 'wind'. He/She/It must also have knowledge about it. Being able to move from island to island horizontal and vertically. It doesn't matter how he can fly, by magic, steam engined plane, zeppelin or just a big kite. Then with his arcane knowledge of gravity and wind cycle, combined with his data of the island form, volume, and mass now he can predicted where and when each of his islands moves. The last thing to do is to create the map then. The map obviously will be much different and more exciting of course than our map. It can be something like a brass globe, with some kind of dials to input date info at the base. When we change the date, it will also move the gear inside and change the islands layout accordingly. Well you also could make the map on magic parchment, that is touch interactive like our nowadays touch screen. Of course we should make a small room of error for the sake of the adventures. Be it a big enough unmapped land, with rare creatures and weird indigenous people live on it. Some area that always covered with mist or even other islands near the core or far away above the clouds. I wish you a clear sky and safe trip. Kindest Regards Sky Cartographers Guild Meister 

Not unless they were natural readers. The march of progress only marches if people, as a whole, get smarter over time. In order for an R-Selection species to grow in average intelligence would be if every generation read what the generation before had written. We take care of our elderly, and have done for a long time. By doing this, they can pass on their knowledge to people who are young enough to use it. They make less mistakes, ergo better survival rates overall. Without the ability to pass on knowledge, we don't get smarter. You'd need your species to instinctively know how to read and there's no science I know of to suggest something that intricate could be passed on genetically. However, language is definitely "in our DNA" in that we know instinctively how to learn a language and the language we learn is just whatever we're exposed to. So your aliens COULD, theoretically, only communicate in visual cues allowing a writing system to be similar enough to their "vocal" communication that they could instinctively pick it up easier. It all depends how much "Suspension of Disbelief" you're going for. 

Answers do not have to be super hard science but the more believable an explanation, the better. Also, I'm willing to change the setting minimally, if you have a particularly believable explanation. 

He/it doesn't need to sleep and eat. Nor also his cell decaying (so he would never aging and still always be on top of his condition). He is stranded on a place that there is nothing there except sandy ground and peebles. It is limitlessly vast, and always basking on a gentle light, there's no night and day, like it always like early morning ambience. Weather change is also absence. On top of this situations he just not going crazy, or desperate so he killed himself. He always looking for an activity to amuse himself. 

I think let the Ai did it. Count every important person that would be needed including some who should do the hardwork, but also lets make the Ai cross analyze their social media, and criminal records (if we want to restart the earth, make sure we just bring the good seeds). Last, make sure the system can work with no human interference, and no one can change it, and don't let the programmer knows what the Ai real use. So lets not get everyone with the drama of who should or shouldn't be in the ark. Lets make it cold but fair, that some of us will be picked by force of the machine and put there to prolong humanity whether we liked it or not. 

Do older textiles made from naturally occurring fibres present any clear benefits over synthetic fibres? Given the following information about the setting, is there any reason that organic materials would be preferable to fibres like nylon. 

I am writing a rule system for a homebrew space sci-fi tabletop RPG. As part of this process I also need to come up with gear to give my players. My setting, with two major exceptions that don't affect melee weaponry, my setting is set in very hard science. I like things like carbon nano-tubes, and megastructures, and fusion that are understood now or theorised now but hard to do. Basically, I don't want anything that requires new science. Other questions on this site have already dealt with the question of whether or not melee is ever viable and proven that it is in many cases. Just not usually warfare. This will be reflected in the guns being mostly superior but, due to roleplaying situations, sometimes the guns will become less viable or unavailable. Therefore, I need to give players the option of carrying, and being skilled in, melee weapons. (Or martial arts) How would melee weaponry (like knives, brass knuckles, and shock batons) be improved in the future? And what about defences? Could we see retractable perspex-like shields? A Folded Graphene Katana? Or a shock glove that works at short ranges? Ideally it would be something already in the works, but any idea that's plausible enough is very much appreciated. 

Ammo Homing Bullets. Flying insects with pistol shrimp-like claws that find a victim and fly upwards in a parabola. At the peak, they start gliding downwards slowly, and use the pistol shrimp hammer-claws to launch themselves forward and shoot into their target like a bullet, cutting their spinal cord. Melee Blunt bony hammer-like tools with claws on either side to destroy enemy craft. Stinging nettles the size of swords with deadly neurotoxins in the needles. Explosives Witch hazel-like plants that explode on contact, with the force of a megaton of TNT. 

The spriggan is a giant bioluminescent insect covered in barklike layers of chitin. The spriggan has branchlike appendages with "leaves" at the end, which are biologically similar to wings like those of a butterfly or moth. The spiggan's third pair of limbs are hinged behind their arms, and are covered in spikes to use as weapons. 

Petrification Medusa releases a toxin into the local environment that bonds to the color receptors on the optic nerve. The toxin activates when Medusa's eye color is seen, causing the calcium in the bones to leech out through the flesh and out of the pores, calcifying the skin, effectively making a person a statue. Snake hair The snakes contain glands that emit the toxin. Petrification - Alternative The toxin hijacks the amygdala, causing the person to experience constant fear. The person can't move while medusa covers them in cement.
