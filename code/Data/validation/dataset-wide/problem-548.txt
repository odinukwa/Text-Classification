I can rotate it so it hits the stop, but the derailleur position looks like it would not work, the b-screw is all the way out, not really hitting the stop dead-on, and the derailleur cage is hitting the seat stay: 

I just talked to an experienced wheel builder -- Rich, the guy who builds for Rivendell -- and he said that his rule of thumb is after three spokes have broken, it's time to respoke or rebuild the wheel. That assumes you've replaced the spokes as they broke, and re-trued the wheel if necessary from any time riding with missing spokes. 

Any ideas on cause? My initial theory was that it was built too tight, but most advice online (and Rohloff support, and Velocity support who I also emailed) says that'd be unusual. I guess I just can rebuild and hope for the best, but it would be nice to have some sense of causation so as to prevent this from happening again. 

The link says that the BB you have is a 68mm shell width, which is standard ISO/British thread. That's going to fit a lot of bikes. It is not designed specifically for eccentric bottom brackets. To use the item you linked to in a single/fixed speed bike you would need horizontal (or at least diagonal) dropouts. If that was part of an eccentric BB assembly, you would also have had something sort of like this: $URL$ that it would have gone into, and then that eccentric BB would have gone into an oversized/eccentric bottom bracket shell that was part of the bike frame. If you still have that eccentric bottom bracket, then you might be able to go looking for a frame with a same-size eccentric bottom bracket shell that it would fit into. Such a frame would then have vertical dropouts, because there's no reason to have an eccentric shell and horizontal dropouts in the same frame -- don't need to solve the chain-tensioning problem twice. 

My wife and I spent two months of summer 2012 biking around Europe. So this answer is necessarily biased towards temperate-to-warm region where it rains. There are a several places where I've made brand references; I'm not associated with any of these companies, but some items were just so good that they are worth mentioning specifically. This is what I brought: A. On-bike clothes One of my main priorities was to be covered from the sun as much as possible, so I would have to wear as little sunscreen as possible -- it gets sticky after a day of riding, and possibly toxic (particularly if you're putting it on every single day all over). (1) Mid-calf polyester pants ("capris"). I took a pair of Sickle Crux climbing pants and cut them mid-calf to have maximum sun protection. They're made out of really comfortable and slick nylon that lasts a long time. (2) White long sleeve polyester shirt. I used the Patagonia Forerunner shirt (which sadly no longer comes in white), and it was excellent. I had another similar shirt on this trip but would bring two Forerunners next time since they are lighter weight but still block the sun. (3) Bandanna. Makes me look like I am German, but it keeps the back of my neck from getting burned. (4) Socks. I hate wearing dirty socks. While I'm normally a minimalist, I brought about four pairs of socks and didn't regret it. Thin, biking-specific socks -- Pearl Izumi, Sock Guy. Also polyester for quick drying. (5) Yellow biking jacket. My wife and I both have Pearl Izumi's yellow biking jackets and love them. Well ventilated, well made. I've had mine for seven years now I think. (6) Really Comfortable Shoes. Again Pearl Izumi here, with their X-Alp shoes, which worked as both on- and off-bike shoes. (7) Bike gloves. Because you don't want to rip up your hands if you crash. Also for sun protection. That's it. One item that is missing that most people would have on this list, and before this trip I would have thought would be crazy to omit, is bike shorts. But after a few days in warm weather, on long biking days with breaks in the middle, I found that I valued ventilation over padding (by a long shot). B. Raingear Note: pack this on the top of your pannier, 'cos it is the one set of stuff you will want in a rush. (1) Lightweight Rain Jacket and Pants. Gore-tex or other waterproof-breathable equivalent. My personal pick is Marmot Precip, since it is cheaper but solidly made. I've gotten really rained on a few times in it and had no problems. The rain jacket seems redundant with the yellow biking jacket, above, but raingear just doesn't breathe that well, making it unpleasant when raining. (2) Shoe covers. Gore-tex or other waterproof breathable. I spent a long while researching this -- it seems like no shoe cover is perfect -- and went with the Gore Bike Wear "Race Power" ones. More expensive, but they worked well. Don't forget to bring a leg tie for when you're wearing rain pants. I use mine to hold my rolled-up rain pants so they are always together. C. Off-bike Clothes. I brought one other set of off-bike clothes, a pair of nylon travel pants and a loose-fitting loose-woven cotton long-sleeve shirt (actually I brought two, but if I were going again, I'd only bring one). Flip-flops (Chaco Flips . . . so comfortable. I lost them along the way and paid way too much for a replacement pair in Switzerland). My wife said her favorite piece of off-bike clothing was a stretch cotton black skirt, which was easy to put on over bike shorts in the middle of the day (for lunch or shopping) to look more normal. D. Warm Clothes. (1) A pair of polyester long underwear. (2) Patagonia down jacket (or "down sweater" as they call it). This is, I think, my favorite article of clothing. Super-light, super warm. Doubles as a pillow. (3) Arm warmers. My wife also brought leg warmers since she gets cold. Merino wool is nice. Washing and drying In terms of washing and drying, we just brought a baggie of detergent, or I'd often just use soap. When we arrived wherever we were staying (campgrounds, hotels, B&Bs), we washed it pretty soon after arriving, just making that part of daily ritual like brushing your teeth or showering. Often I'd just bring clothes into the shower and wash them there. Usually things dried out by morning. If they didn't we'd either strap them on to the outside of our bags, or if they were only damp, just wear them. Polyester dries out pretty fast, and you warm up while riding, which speeds it along. About every 7-10 days we'd find a laundromat (or use friends' washing machines when we stayed with them) on a rest day and wash our clothes there to get them all thoroughly clean. 

Since this isn't an answer yet, I'll be the guy to say: "No. There is not any advantage to using pedal straps over clipless pedals, other than not having to buy special biking shoes". I started using clipless eighteen years ago, and at least in the first few years I would go back to ordinary shoes with strap-pedals for a bit, usually because I wanted to look cool or dressy and didn't want to wear my kinda-dorky clipless shoes. Also, for a while I had a bike with French cranks that only took old toe-strap pedals. I don't do straps anymore, because every time I'm disappointed in the ride (I'm also married and have a kid and don't feel a need to wear cool shoes as much, but that's secondary). With straps, I feel like my feet slip around, there is less power on the upstroke, and I find it harder to get the right position for my foot. It feels squishy where I have come to expect solidity. I've found some clipless shoes that look fairly normal, and are comfortable street shoes for walking. I keep them by the bikes, and it's just part of leaving the house for a ride: helmet, gloves, shoes. I tapped out the French pedals, and now it's clipless all the time on all the bikes. And yeah, I did fall over at a street light, once, in 2000. Embarrassing, but no injuries. Kids who were born that day are now looking at colleges; during their entire lifetime I've been biking all over the place and it hasn't happened again. Clipless now feels like part of my anatomy, the connection does what I want without thought. Not entirely on-point for the question, but since this will probably be read by people curious about clipless: make sure you try out a few systems and don't assume they are all the same. My buddy and I started out in 1999 on Shimanos because they are ubiquitous, but at some point someone gave him a pair of Time ATACs to try out, and he was like "you have to try these, they are so much better." I tried them too, and agreed, and it's all I've used since. (They are also pretty cheap, for the Aliums). I haven't tried all the other systems, but I can say at least on a Shimano-ATAC comparison for me, it made a big difference.
