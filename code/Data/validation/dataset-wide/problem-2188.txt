That's 4 possibilities. Another option is to consider researching companies through LinkedIn or find recruiters that may also be a useful option depending on if there are local companies that hire often. Course if you are at a university, do they have a career services department or some group that may help place you in internships? That may be better than social media at times. 

"There could well be the question of" means "the question may be asked in response" as you say "No" and then respond with any of the questions stated. "Using then putting those form may be useful" is about what you want to use that you'd tell your superiors you want to use though there has to be something for the company to gain as while you could learn how to cook a souffle, this isn't necessarily that useful for the company. In other words, be aware that what you may want to gain may not be seen as that good for the company. "reading into this various promises which could be worth noting somewhere" could be interpreted as when you hear this there are other things you are adding rather than seeing just what is there. "Reading between the lines" would be another phrase where some people will interpret and add additional details that may make something mean something completely different than what is seen. "a lot of concern is being given" would be about what depth is meant where the statement could be seen similar to "How are you" that for some is a question and others is just a greeting. 

How do you deal with food allergies in the workplace? has some basic stuff worth noting. If you don't have experience with allergies then it may be worth having a private conversation with the person to get whatever details you need. The key here is that you might not know how to handle things and thus it is worth considering what questions do you want answered. Stories like Teen Dies After Deadly Peanut Butter Kiss are what you want to avoid. You should consult your boss to see what is the policy. It may be that you are allowed peanut butter but you have to be careful with it. Clean the jar meant that when you are done with the jar, to wash it out so that there isn't a residue that could cause a problem if the employee with the allergy comes into contact with the jar somehow. 

Which way are you wanting to slice this? To state it, is not hard, true. Just saying the words and nothing else is what you state that could be rather myopic. To not have it change how an employer would see you and judge you for it? That is where I suspect you may be missing something here as what if there are 4 other applicants just as good only the other 3 are all more recent graduates? This is what you will be competing against in a year when you job hunt don't forget. The key question is how well can you sell that you are still a great fit for the job and are good to go even though you spent a year away from development? 

Consider how are you bringing this up. Are you believing that there is only one way to do things and thus if it isn't that way, it has to be wrong, poor or suboptimal? There can be lots of ways to do things and it may be that you are not understanding someone else's perspective here for one point. Consider how well are you using these habits from 7 Habits of Highly Effective People: 

How often do you talk to your subordinates? Are there common "Good morning" and "Good night" messages sent around the office from you to them? This can be useful in leading into the "How are things?" question that you may want to ask though if you spring it on someone out of the blue, it can be quite awkward, sure. Some bosses I've had would manage by walking around and some would just leave things alone giving a bit too much autonomy to the subordinates, in my opinion. However, the point here is that if my boss comes to my desk how confident can I feel that it is an, "Uh oh, I'm in trouble..." situation. Do you have an "open-door" policy with your subordinates? If they bring something that you see as rather trivial how is this treated? This can be where your receptivity is tested in a sense as depending on how things are received would determine if I'd often bring things to my boss or not. Are there team lunches with your subordinates? Within Canada and the US from what I've seen this can happen and can be useful in building that initial bond. Sometimes the boss would pay and sometimes not, though the idea here is to have some time to chat in a sense. While you may have your preferred channels, how well do you what channels they prefer? Some people may prefer to talk, some prefer to text, some may prefer e-mail, some may prefer instant messages. This is something to consider as some people may prefer written communications over verbal ones. When expressing interest, there is something to be said for what kind posture and attitude do you project in this situation. There are people that express interest in a way that they appear to be a ravenous dog that just found a steak which could get people to clam up as if I feel that I'm about to be eaten alive, I may well just shut up at that point. The other side is to give those nods and "Uh-huh" messages that while it may appear you are listening, I can question the authenticity of that listening since there isn't any feedback. While there is the starting point of initiating a conversation, there is something to be said for keeping it going. Some people may often come back with a one upping story that can also lead some to shut down. If I tell a story that only leads you to tell something better that happened to you, how often do you think I'll let you get away with that? 

At work, on the job - Are there people you work with regularly in your development? How well do you associate with these people? Do you help them with their work? Do you learn from them? At work, off the job - Do you take breaks with co-workers? Do you have lunch with co-workers? There can be something to be said for hanging out with co-workers to get to know them and build various bonds. Away from work - Have you thought about socializing away from work with some of the co-workers? Perhaps some will go to a bar sometime during the week that can be another opportunity to get to know them. Perhaps you could go see a movie with these people? There are various ideas here for how to spend time with people that may work. Social media - Could you be friends with these people on sites like Facebook, LinkedIn, or Twitter? This is an idea and depending on what you post there and how you use these sites, this can vary as an idea but it is something to consider. 

In a year's time, who is to say what state the economy will be so that the demand for developers where you live would be higher or lower than it is right now? That is a big factor that depending on some historical time frames some could be useful and some could be rather bad. Trying to find work as a developer in 2001 may have been rather hard while the late 1990s could be much easier. There is also the potential for there to be another year's worth of graduates looking for work so that could also impact how good you appear given that you are a bit older than others looking for the same job, particularly if they just did a Bachelor's and go into industry while you have a PhD and probably spent more time in school I'd suspect. What kind of work would you want and how would you feel if you were the hiring manager? "Yeah, we got a possible developer that spent the last year travelling. Does that sound like he'd be a good fit here?" where for some places it may work well and for a lot it wouldn't. They would wonder how sharp are your skills, how long would you take to produce something useful in the role, what kind of other things may you do later that could upset timelines? Aside from the, "I wanted to see the world," do you have other stuff you'd bring up as assets for having done the trip that relate to the job? For example, would you state that you have experienced other cultures by taking this trip? Would you seek to find contacts and see how IT is done in various places around the world in this trip? There are different ways to use this as seeing it merely as burying your skills for a year doesn't really paint the real picture here. 

Recruiter Matrices - There are times where I've seen recruiters e-mail me a list of questions for me to answer about what kind of job I want, what are my skill levels, etc. that would be quite similar to the questionnaire you describe here that I have no issue filling out as part of being in their system. Company introduction essays - I've had less than a handful of times where I have been e-mailed a questionnaire to fill out various questions that a company wanted to know about me. Generally, I'd see this as providing food for the in-person interview as well as verifying my written skills to some degree. 

What commonalities are there between the 2 positions that should tell you about what kind of workplaces don't work well for you? This may be worth considering in terms of what kind of qualities in a work environment do work well for you. There is some analysis here that only you can do as I'd suspect there were other issues with that last position other than changing one piece of software. As for dealing with this in future interviews, I'd argue that the insight you get from looking into how those positions didn't work out is the secret. I've had a couple of places where things didn't work out well and I would likely say that in that environment, I was an island which didn't work well for me. The key is to not bad mouth the past employer while acknowledging what preferences I may have that made the fit not work in the end. 

I wouldn't but it could be safe. Some places would pounce on that if you are really underpaid so much, that they could make a killing off of representing you as companies may pay quite a mark-up that you'd be OK given you get a bit of a bump up and the company takes a major cut of the profits here. Think about this way: If the company can bill you out for $200/hour and give you $40/hour, they make a mighty nice profit off of you in contrast to someone that bills out for the same rate but takes $140/hour instead.
