Yes it is possible to increase the strength in your muscles without necessarily getting bigger. It depends on the way you exercise, the methods that you use. Gymnasts usually are very light but possess tremendous amounts of strength. A test for a gymnast's strength is to double his own body weight on all core upper body exercises - Dips, Chin-Ups, Bench press. Another example you can see on this link. IronMind 1998 Training Hall: Unbelievable Bulgarians - Towards the end of the video you can see Galabin Boevski being 69kgs(~150lbs) squatting 250kgs(~550lbs). Most of the guys in the gyms over here way around 220lbs and are proud when they can squat their own weight. But they train to look big not to gain strength. 

I am sorry but after reading your post I couldn't understand what your current goals are. For example do you want to gain muscle mass, or muscle strength, or maybe perhaps endurance? I am not familiar with the hundred push ups program and the dips program, that might be the reason why I don't get it. However in my training I usually target a specific gymnastics' strength move on the rings(let's say). Which means that I will dedicate all of my training to it which sometimes might be several months. Excluding the deloading phase I would train the same muscle groups(which are being involved in that move) for 3 to 4 times per week. Doing bench dips with bent knees or with your heels on the floor is pretty much the same exercise, slightly varied(I would consider the one with the heels on the floor more advanced and harder). So instead of doing bench dips on both workout days, instead, try something that is still going to target your triceps and shoulders but differently. It is not impossible to keep training the same muscle groups and continuing making progress(in any direction you desire) if you vary the exercises well. The more the exercises differ from each other the easier your progress. If you tell me your current goals and which muscle groups you wish to target we can build a program together. Also do you do weights or do you depend on body weight exercises only? edit Regarding your question about the intervals between two similar exercises. The interval could be no longer than the appropriate amount of time your body will need to recover fully after your last workout. In my case that would be around a day. 

So I found some exercises presented by the black guy in the middle of the second photo on this link: Christopher Cuomo And I also found one more leg workout from a male ballet dancer. Tyler from RW Ballet Workout Video I will try these tomorrow, they look like exercises for women. I can't imagine people gaining muscle this way but photos speak for themselves. I hope to see some other ideas as well. 

There's a video tutorial that I had released couple years ago explaining the progression methods that you can use in order to learn the exercise. What's great about this exercise is that no matter which progression you start with, it will provide your abs with an immense workout from the very beginning. Here's a link to the tutorial I am talking about, if you have any questions fire away at me! $URL$ (Disclosure: The video materials are mine) 

In my training I tend to have periods when I deload and just enjoy all kinds of food. That would typically happen during holidays when I give my body full rest for couple weeks. At these moments I gain enough fat to lose any track of my six pack(which happens to an extend because of muscle atrophy as well) and then after I get back on track I am quickly getting rid of all fat once again. I have noticed and pointed out on many occasions that I tend to gain fat in a certain manner and lose it the same way. For example - I firstly put fat on the sides of my stomach, then on my abs, then on my arms. When I lose fat it starts from my arms, then my abs and lastly lose the fat from the sides and lower back. I hope my answer helps you. :) 

I know calculating sounds like the right way to approach your question but theory is theory, de facto things are often different. I don't remember reading about any bodybuilder who promotes beans and lentils over meat. I have heard many times that beans and lentils are very high in protein but nothing replaces meat. Proteins from beans and proteins from meat just feel different. In my case my workouts are mainly strength based and whenever I cut on the meat I drop in strength(obviously trying to replace it with beans and lentils). In the end my advice for you is to experiment and see how you feel about them. You can always go back to meat. This sounds like the only proper way to answer your question. Everybody is different and no survey can give you an ultimate answer. 

I have the very same problem. The reason for being unable to squat down for me without lifting my heels is the lack of flexibility in the area of the tibia bone(not sure what it is called in english). Anyhow try the following to see if flexibility is the problem for you as well. Go close to a desk/table or just anything you can hold onto as you are squatting down(keep the object in front of you). Now after you grab that object begin squatting down slowly leaning towards the object(without lifting your heels). As you go down your knees should go forward towards your the toes of your feet(in order to keep your balance). Do you feel a discomfort feeling, kind of like stretching between the top part of your feet that goes up by your tibia bones(on both of your legs)? I am sorry I am unable to explain this better. If that's your case then I can give you some exercises for improving the flexibility in that area. 

I agree with MountainX about the stress. Stress is proven by several studies to make you lose muscle, increasing the muscle catabolism. I have noticed that stress affects my body, making me lose muscle, even more than I have seen it affecting my friends. However I don't think this is your problem. You mentioned not working out for 10 days. I have learnt from gymnastics' coaches in my gym that it takes exactly 3 days of not using a particular muscle group in your body and the process of muscle atrophy will be present there. That's because, as Berin mentioned, your body will see no reason to maintain a bigger muscle group. It will burn more calories on a daily basis, harder to maintain and so on. That's why the body will decrease the amount of muscle in a certain area regarding the amount of load/exercising that you apply to it. In other words use it or lose it. Again as Berin mentioned, muscles have memory so you can regain your muscle size and strength in a very short period of time. The only certain way to maintain particular amount of muscle mass is to keep working out. You have to remind the body that you need that muscle group and it should keep it there. If you don't have enough time for a whole workout you can still maintain the size just by throwing in several sets of clean executed chin-ups/biceps curling throughout your day. The examples serves the biceps muscle group. 

and 4. which is a littler irrelevant but I would like to share it with you for I feel you might need to know that. Every joint has different flexibility. For example I have seen gymnasts that could do splits but were inflexible in their shoulders. Thus they had to focus more on shoulder flexibility in order to catch up. Thus don't get discouraged right away and see how your overall flexibility develops! 

At a first glimpse the standing desks seem like another "improvement" companies throw to an item to make customers upgrade and re-buy the same thing. Essentially it's just a desk, right? That's what I thought until I started my current job which provided me with a standing desk. My job is sedentary and very static. I experimented and on some days remained sitting without raising the desk for the whole day. As a result my lower back would start hurting a little(old injury) and my legs would start feeling bloated. I would have to go for a long walk afterwards to get rid of this uncomfortable sensations. Currently I spend the first hour at work standing, having my desk raised. Then I sit down and switch every hour or so. I would work standing until I get tired. I cannot really say that it gets my blood going but it provides me with a chance to change my posture to something more natural than sitting. If you do a quick research you will find out that a lot of the back problems are developed by office jobs. By sitting on a chair for hours. Like for example - Discopathy, Disc Hernia and so on and so forth. Standing tall, straightens your back and allows you to avoid this. I am personally about to buy a standing desk for home too. It's a game changer for me. 

If you are swinging you are most likely trying to go too fast or you are lacking strength so the natural reaction of your body is to generate additional momentum so you can complete your pull-up. Thus, here's what I suggest to you. 

That is a good question. Years ago I started with weight lifting but then switched to body weight training. Obviously as you said after you pass a certain number of push-ups you continue working endurance with little to no strength. That's why I switched to gymnastics strength exercises. Now you can say that if you go on a holiday you can't do these. However that depends on the holiday. I usually bring a pair of rings that I hang from a tree and I continue my workouts. That or one can always look for a pull-up bar OR bring a portable one with him(that can be attached to a door. Obviously the pull-up bar will be insufficient for some of the exercises below but those that could be executed on it are more than enough for a good workout! The compound exercises that I would recommend would be: To list just a few of the Shoulder exercises: -Handstand Push-Up -Front Lever -Back Lever -Muscle-Up -Ab-Wheel Rollout -Pseudo Back Lever Pull-Up Harder exercises would be: -Iron Cross -Planche -One Arm-Chin Up Here's a workout that I recorded for my followers to demonstrate some of these exercises: $URL$ Watch the video and you will see a demonstration for most of the listed ones. These will NOT only allow you to maintain strength but will boost it as well. Here's a routine that doesn't include a pull-up bar or rings: -Handstand Push-Ups x 8-12 for 3 sets ; -Ab-wheel Rollout/Crunches x 5 for 2 sets(or 30 for 3 sets if you are doing crunches) ; -Wide Stance Push-Ups x 15 for 4 sets ; -L-Sit on the ground for time for 2 sets; -Plank for time Here's a routine designed for a pull-up bar, rings: -Front Lever(or a variation of it) x 6 for 5 sets; -Diamond Push-Ups x 10 for 3 sets; -Regular Pull-Ups x 10 for 3 sets, if you do them in a L-Sit you will put more stress on the shoulders and work the abs too; -Crunches x 25 for 3 sets her. 

I wouldn't advise you to exercise like that. Even if you switch hands on each set it will still be uncertain what results you will get out of it. The only proper solution to your problem would be to use only one dumbbell during your workout. Go for one hand at a time and then do the other. For the first 2 years of my training I had only one dumbbell at home before I started going to the gym and that's how I would workout. Yes it would take a little bit more time to finish a workout but there won't be any negative side effects. 

You can do sit-ups isolating the one leg which you have injured. Planks might help you a little but they are not all that challenging for the abs area after one moment onwards. The only exercise that I can think of right now that will completely isolate your knee(and is not very advanced) is the dragon flag. It got popular thanks to bruce lee who introduced it to the world in his active years. The exercise primarily targets the abdominal muscle area of your body, it will also work out your arms a tad bit and completely leave the legs to rest. Below you can see snapshot of Bruce Lee performing it. 

You are correct above 5-6 reps you start going away from strength training. However for a OAP you should not focus on the repetitions. Even 5 is a lot and will get you injured most likely. Take it from somebody who has been there. Actually for the OAP I am providing you to a link of a tutorial of mine: One Arm Chin-Up Tutorial As for the need of a variety in your workouts. Let's take a look at the exercises you are aiming for. The one armed push up and the handstand push-ups are pretty much of the same difficulty and you should achieve fairly easy if you have some previous background body weight training. Thus I doubt you will hit a plateau with them. The One Armed Chin-Up is a different story however. Especially if you are more built rather than skinny. It takes a huge amount of strength to perform even one OAC and a lot of adaptation for the body to that skill. You will hit plateaus a lot of times and will have to switch your workouts often in order to continue progressing. Sometimes the body will need time to build strength and you won't be seeing any progress for a while since it doesn't happen overnight. It's an exercise that involves several muscle groups so what I advise you to do is to change the muscle group you are training for on every other workout. There should be one direct exercise that is a variation of the One Armed Chin-Up and several assisting exercising focusing specifically on a particular muscle group that is involved in the pull-up.
