San Marino had given a safe haven to key figures in the Italian unification movement, including Garibaldi, and apparently that's why San Marino’s desire for independence was respected. more info The link also talks about the recognition of san marino by the Kingdom of Italy in 1862. I don't know why they did not want to unify and why the new Italian state wasn't that bothered. But it might because of san marino's remote location in the Apennines. Support from France seem to have kept san marino safe from the papal states and Austria during the period, so it seems likely this safeguarded their independence from the kingdom of Italy as well. 

The German and Austrian Jewish population was about 750,000, of which three quarters were exterminated. Whereas the total German population was about 70 million. But 1941, when the extermination program began the number of Jewish forced labourers in German was 60,000, compared to the 2,000,000 foreign labourers (Fremdarbeiter) [source]. The Nazis decided that this was not an economic impediment to the Holocaust. Furthermore, in regions where the sudden absence of Jewish Labour would have been a problem they delayed the process to allow for their replacement. It seems logical that the movement from forced labour to Extermination through Labour and the Holocaust of the Jewish population would have lead to costs (from the inefficiency of moving skilled workers to hard labour, to the expenses of diverting effort to commit to commit these awful crimes). These must have been the disruptions the Nazis had in mind and saw as no economic reason not to proceed. I will say the Jews brought from conquered lands for forced labour probably would have been an overall benefit to the German war effort, but I'm not including that as the "holocaust" as I'm assuming the alternative the questioner has in mind is assigning these foreign Jews to the Fremdarbeiter system anyway. So no, it wasn't a massive strategic mistake. I've not considered other angles, like it's effect on their nuclear program, but in raw economic terms the Nazi's don't seem to have been punished for their terrible crimes. So, to conclude, Holocaust, whilst being one of the most horrendous crimes against humanity in history, wasn't as economically significant as OP may have suspected.

It sounded good for marketing purposes, for engaging the average industrial worker without the revolutionary baggage of Communism. It is important to understand that when it comes to statism, right and left don't matter that much. While they will give different reasons why they're chaining you down, enslaving you or murdering you and there may be different people wielding the bludgeon or the gun, the end result is the same. In other words, meet the new boss, same as the old boss. 

I would point to the massive expansion of government regulation starting in the early progressive era, expanding even more in the 1930's and really exploding in the 1960's, expanding even more with the "War on Drugs" and "War on Terrorism". As it's turned out, while the initial roots were on the political left, the political right has embraced it as well. Bludgeoning ordinary citizens with the law is something both left and right wing mainstream US politicians can agree on. Starting in the mid-1960's the incarceration rate started increasing and really took off by the mid-1980's. 

Edit to add some additional ones, based on the criteria of less than 12 months between coups... In Bolivia, on October 6, 1970 Juan José Torres seized power from Alfredo Ovando Candía. In turn, on August 21, 1971, General Hugo Banzer staged a successful coup with the help of the military and, perhaps, assistance as part of Operation Condor. In Burundi in July 1966, Prince Ntare V deposed his father. On November 28th of 1966, Michel Micombero, who had earlier assisted Ntare, staged a coup, abolished the monarchy and took power himself. In Ethiopia, September 12, 1974 Aman Mikael Andom overthrew Emperor Haile Selassie I. On November 17th 1974, Andom was killed by forces loyal to the Provisional Military Administrative Council (aka Derg). In 1987, Fiji had a string of coups. In 1983, the island of Grenada had several coups, finally ending with the intervention of the US. Haiti saw several coups from 1988 onward after the departure of Jean-Claude "Baby Doc" Duvalier in 1986 up until the threat of US intervention in 1994. Leadership changed hands several times and exactly who was in charge wasn't always clear. In 1994, the Rwandan Civil War resulted in several leadership changes and terrible genocide. There are certainly some others I didn't cover here so feel free to add more examples. 

Here's one site that has a few. I hope you'll be using these as inspiration to write your own letter, not just copying them. Good luck! 

I think the OP knows that the Dravidians were in India before the Aryans, and is asking why historians don't talk more about them. The answer is that Sanskrit (Aryan) scholarship has been going on in the west for centuries, while we still can't read the Indus Valley (probably Dravidian) script. Most of what we know about the Indus Valley civilization is based on archeology. In other words, a) we don't know much about them, and b) what we do know is pretty dry reading. Written records let you tell stories about individual people, which tends to get more popular attention because it's more fun to read than the results of a carbon dating test. Anyone interested in the subject should take a look at India: A History by John Keay. Unlike most popular histories of India, it pays a lot of attention to the times and areas for which we don't have written records. The first couple of chapters are the best writing I've found about the Dravidian/Aryan encounters. 

I was reading that the bananas we eat today (Cavendish) weren't particularly popular until the 50s, when the more popular Gros Michel variety was virtually wiped out by a nasty disease. Apparently Gros Michel was much sweeter and had a different flavour and texture. There are several interesting articles on the subject online, and Amazon lists a couple of books that look interesting. What I'm looking for here is primary sources - things written around the time the transition was taking place, describing people's personal reactions to the new bananas. By personal reaction, I mean I'm not interested in sales data or whether executives thought people would like them - I want to know whether regular people noticed the change and, if so, what they said about it. 

I'd guess you're mainly referring to the Elizabethan Act of Uniformity and related laws from the same period which set out the church laws and their connection to the state. Some of the provisions in the Act of Uniformity were repealed or modified in 1650 by the Rump Parliament and Cromwell. They were replaced by other restrictive laws, such as the Blasphemy Act. In 1689, The Act of Toleration repealed most of the provisions of earlier acts and provided a measure of religious freedom for most Protestant denominations although Catholics and others were still effectively outlawed or restricted. These ongoing restrictions became an important reason for people to immigrate to the American colonies. Over the centuries, parts of these religious laws were repealed or modified as suited the contemporaneous political events. For example, the Roman Catholic Relief Acts in 1791 and 1829 were intended to help deal with the political situation in Ireland and to better handle political events in Europe. This continues today, most recently with provisions in the 2010 Equality Act. 

In Hitler's mind, defeating the Soviet Union was the most important thing. In Mein Kampf his concept for Lebensraum encompassed much of European Russia. In spite of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Non-Aggression Pact he was quoted as saying in 1939... 

Then, I encountered John Plumbe. He and his chain of Daguerreotype galleries from 1840-1847 are a good example of what I was looking for. I was looking at too late of a time period. Thanks to RI Swamp Yankee mentioning the Daguerreotype. Overall, it seems that a Daguerreotype studio gave way over time to the photography studio. As it remains today, it was a relatively inexpensive business to get into and one that has a lot of turnover. 

Here is some info on travel restrictions in a very specific period. During the 1948–1959 All-Palestine Government Period (a puppet state of Egypt controlling Gaza) 14,000 All-Palestine passports were issued, mostly to Gazan notables and businessmen, with any Palestinians being eligible (including residents of the Jordanian controlled West Bank). It's hard to say what percentage of the population this was. 1945 figures show 32,250, but this was before the Nakba and the next figure is 100,272 in 1982. Ahmed Mu-awad, writing in Sarakha Illah al-Sama [Cry to Heaven] states: "Among the tens of passports that I checked, I foud many with entrance permits to Egypt, and a few with Saudi Arabian permits" This suggests that entrance to Egypt did not come with this passport, but was often granted by the Egyptian government. The book goes onto state that the passport was not recognised elsewhere. So it would seem that the main function of this passport was admittance to Egypt. 

The order of the garter was "Restored to gift of the Sovereign by Attlee in 1946". So maybe he wouldn't accept it from the Labour prime minister but would accept it from the monarch. I personally think 'sour grapes, dissipating' is the explanation, it fits with his personality, which seems a bit tempestuous. And he did change party (or "Cross the Floor") twice, so perhaps he was open to changing his mind from time to time. 

Another battle between the Russians and Germans that seems similar is Battle of Tannenberg during WWI. Out of 206,000 men of the trapped Russian Second Army 78,000 were killed or wounded and 92,000 taken prisoner [1]. However it seems Stalingrad still has the edge on this because both sides had their backs against the wall in 1942, whereas Tannenberg was a bit more one-sided. The Battle of Seden destroyed an entire french army (mostly captured, not dead) and lost the Franco Prussian war for them but like Tannenberg was one sided and over quickly. An eastern example of a high casualty battles which outcome decided a large war is the Battle of Fei River (700,000 out of 870,000 deaths on the losing side according to the Book of Jin). But again this was fairly one sided. So maybe encirclement isn't the important thing and it's about countries stubbornly pouring manpower into the meat-grinder of an "un-loseable" war of attrition. The Western Front of WWI is a great example (lots of decimated units here[2]). Verdun being a particularly horrific fight over some hilly ground near Verdun-sur-Meuse. Loss at Verdun might have might have lost the war for the Allies, but didn't losw it (not immediately anyway) for Germany. Perhaps Stalingrad was more decisive than Verdun in particular, but if you compare it to the western front in general there are a lot of similarities. As far as other important battles with horrible casualty rates go the Battle of Antietam and percentagewise more lethal Battle of Stones River are good American examples. Leipzig is a good example before industrialised warfare. So while there are lots of examples of desperate fighting, encirclement and awful causalities. I would agree that given the intense struggle on both sides and it's decisive role in the Great Patriotic War (that's WW2) Stalingrad was fairly unique, with the western front in WW1 being the strongest contender in my mind. [1] Source: Sweetman, John (2004), Tannenberg 1914 (1st ed.), London: Cassell, ISBN 978-0-304-35635-5 p158 [2] Somme example: the 1st Newfoundland Regiment suffered 91% casualties in the Somme, 801 men, 500 dead, 233 wounded, which puts it in second place to the 10th Battalion West Yorkshire on the same day but I can't find those numbers [PS] Thought I would mention ambushes like the The Battle of Salsu (302,300 out of 305,000) or 'Quintilius Varus, give me back my legions!, but I don't think they can be compared to Stalingrad. 

There are several types of repeals. First, there are partial repeals where a poorly crafted portion of a law causes problems. For example, the onerous 1099 reporting section of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare) was repealed. The rest of the law remains intact so far but that portion was repealed. Another recent example would be how the Patriot Act (2001), the Terrorist Surveillance Act (2006) and the Protect America Act (2007) effectively gutted provisions of the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Next, there are repeal and replace laws. In some cases, a previous law is explicitly repealed and replaced with another law. In other cases, the law is implicitly replaced and rendered moot without it being formally repealed. This has been done many times. One recent example would be how the Great Depression era Glass–Steagall banking acts were implicitly and explicitly repealed by various acts, most notably the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999. And, there have been outright repeals without a replacement. In this situation, a law or regulation is repealed and the act does not contain any replacement law or regulatory authority. One recent example would be the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010. Another example would be the repeal of laws prohibiting private ownership of gold bullion by US citizens. Sodomy and 'blue' laws have been another common area where laws have been repealed without replacement. 

A lot of it comes from conditioning and training the animal to battle conditions along with genetics. For horses, Kikkuli, the master horse trainer of Hittites in 1345 BCE, described his methods for conditioning horses or chariot warfare in one of the first horse training treatises. His methods aren't too far removed from techniques used today. Europeans, Mongols and Arabs bred horses specifically for their warfare needs, either swift combat maneuvers or the ability to carry a armored person into battle without fear. Horses that failed to make the grade genetically were moved to farm work or simply eaten. One legendary horse is Alexander the Great's Bucephalus. This horse was noted for his ability in battle, stamina and ability to survive. The link also mentions Comanche, the only US military survivor, equine or human, from the Battle of the Little Big Horn. Remember though that most horses didn't survive battles. Dogs were also bred for battle and specifically trained for it. Some breeds are still with us today, such as the mastiff, while other breeds have faded away, like the Alaunt. During the battle of Marathon, it was related by some historians of the time that at least one hoplite brought his dog with him and the dog fought the Persians alongside him. Like horses, war dogs didn't often survive battles and thus didn't become the stuff of legend, at least by name, until recently. Even today, most war dogs work in obscurity. One exception is the Belgian Malinois war dog named Cairo that was in on the Navy SEAL's Bin Laden raid. 

This is a pretty big question; entire books have been written on the subject of postwar Germany. You might want to narrow it down. I'll take a shot at the discrimination portion: While there was a lot of resentment towards the Axis peoples, the growing rivalry between Russia and the western Allies changed the dynamics a lot. American leaders took a more pragmatic view than the general citizenry. Even before the war ended they were working to soften public attitudes towards the German people, as opposed to the Nazi leadership. They did this because they wanted, at all costs, to limit the spread of both Communism and Russian power (which they thought were closely related, but that's another issue entirely :P). They knew that the harsh settlement after WWI, coupled with the worldwide Depression of the 30s, had had a lot to do with the popular support for Naziism; and they worried that another long period of suffering could make the German population go Communist. Moreover, they needed to prepare for a possible war with Russia, which meant fortifying the areas they'd occupied. Germany ended up being partitioned, with the Russians controlling the east and the western Allies taking the West (incidentally, Korea's division into North and South happened at the same time and for the same reason). The western Allies, especially America, knew that if there was to be another shooting war, it would likely be along this border. They wanted the local economy to be both able and willing to support the capitalist faction if that happened. So, the western Allies invested a lot in reconstructing the German economy. In America, the money for reconstructing Europe (not just Germany, though that was a lot of it) was called the Marshall plan. They sold the idea to their populations by downplaying the responsibility of average citizens in the former Axis countries. There were certainly elements of the population that would've preferred to take a more punitive stance, but the combination of moral and practical considerations made the Marshall plan reasonably popular. Of course, even with that help, conditions in Germany (and a lot of other places) were quite rough for the decade or so following WWII. But again, that's a subject for a bookshelf, not a single post. 

The prime example I can think of is Russia. In 1917, the February Revolution put a coalition government, headed by Alexander Kerensky, in charge after Tsar Nicolas abdicated the throne. The October Revolution put Lenin and the communists in charge of the government although a civil war and unsuccessful counter revolutions went on until 1921. 

Greek and Roman civilizations allowed individuals to profit from their work, and not just the king. Individuals were also protected, for the most part, from arbitrary whims of a despotic ruler. This led to innovation through scientific inquiry and open debate of ideas. This kind of openness and freedom was typically restricted in other societies, such as in Achaemenid Empire, where everyone was considered to be a slave of the king. 

Overall, the primary reason the "status quo" was maintained was the availability of upward mobility and the level of political and economic freedom. Restrictions placed on these freedoms by the British Crown led to the Revolution. The thing is that in Colonial America it was easy for a man to own land, thus showing an "interest" in colony and giving them right to vote. This was different from England where hereditary landowners controlled the vote. As the frontier opened up, more people arrived who were looking for opportunity. For example, my ancestors arrived in Louisa County, Virgina in the early 1700's, obtained land and got involved in the political process. If they had remained in England, they wouldn't have achieved anywhere near this level of success. Economically, the mercantilism system worked well for most Colonial Americans. The English made sure that those who participated in this process became wealthy. They used revenue to build their navy into even more of a powerhouse. Of course, Americans did their share of smuggling, but this wasn't so severe as to harm the system. The relative freedom, political and economic, made it unlikely that there would be any 'class' based uprising. There was a clear opportunity for upward advancement within the system. That meant that the average Colonist could look forward to improving their life and the life of their children. Another factor was a reduction in the number of white indentured servants, especially those of lower skills, during the 1700's. Around 189,000 African slaves were brought in between 1701 and 1760. This meant that European indentured servants were likely to be skilled labor, such as weavers, bricklayers and even accountants. It was also easier for white servants to flee and find somewhere else to live within the Colonies. Ben Franklin did this, for example.
