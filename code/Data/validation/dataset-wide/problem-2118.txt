I think you are confusing the internal and external positions of a consulting company. Internally you are an analyst probably a middle to senior level but externally you might be their principal consultant for the said client. This means you are the main consultant representing the consulting company at the client. I do not see anything wrong with this as you seem to be the assigned a good responsible position. This speaks volumes about the confidence of your company in you. 

You can prepare a project plan with estimates. Assign yourself for 60-70 % of yourself for support the daily ( or whatever number you feel comfortable). Assign the rest to the the other BIG project. In big project , assign time to tasks ( requirement gathering/design/development/testing /deployment etc ). Add padding to each task to whatever you are comfortable.(20-30 %). Add vacation days of yourself to this. Add one more level of padding to this ( 20-25% to account for delays which are out of your control). Now you have a rough plan. Present this to your boss. Say it comes out to 8 months or 10 months. If you feel you need training in some feature implementation , mention this in the project plan . If your boss is OK, then you are fine or he will understand he needs to hire one more contractor to help you. Also mention that these are ball park figures as per your knowledge of the project. Before you do this , think whether your boss will like this approach. Some bosses do not like this. SO treat this as a suggestion and do this only if the boss is receptive to this kind of thinking. Some bosses may think you are being over smart for preparing such a project plan and it being a tactic to push them in to a corner. Keep in mind that doing something alone is a challenge sometimes and frustrating but it give us experience in solving many problems, issues and increasing our confidence to resolve anything that comes our way ( personal experience). It helps you in strategic thinking ( post project maybe ). If you are up for the challenge , go for it as not only will it give you tremendous experience but also ultimate satisfaction , a sense of independence in execution and fearlessness in getting involved in any future projects. You must be ready to face many challenges and issues. It will also force you to do a bit of self learning and/or external training. 

If they want you , they will chase you or they will dump you like no tomorrow. That's the norm. In short , he is not chasing you. SO there must be a reason which only he knows. DO not put your expectations on someone just because they asked for something. Nothing is sure unless you sign on the dotted line. Keep looking and forget this. You will get used to it 

I have had some colleagues , who were at the top pay scales get very minor raises 2-5 %. This is because it affects the long term expense of the company. But they did get huge bonuses those years . Did you get a huge bonus ? If yes , you are okay. If not , time to move on. 

It is perfectly OK to take some time off. It is a risk but should be a calculated one , if you have the resources to take that time off. For example , if you plan to take 3 months off , be prepared to be without a job for 5-6 months and be able to take care of the expenses for such a period. If someone asks for a reason why you were unemployed , they will still hire you , if the reason was good enough. Do not let anyone dissuade you , if you truly need a break. Also do plan as to what exactly will you be doing this break. 

One must always follow their dreams and passion. This is where you will likely do the best and get internal satisfaction. It is the best time for you to quit and try this for a year or two. Worst case , you can always fall back on your previous field. Software industry always needs people and i am sure you will be able to land up a job even if you came back after 2-3 years. You don't owe the company anything. They won't ask if you if they need to fire you. When you actually tell your manager that you are quitting to go to your preferred field ( if you tell ) , he would be able to understand. The feeling of guilt and attachment with company and colleagues are like a hangover. It is temporary and transient and it gets out of the system within a month or two. You should not worry about it , as it is natural for humans. Your career is your responsibility and you should make sure that in future when you look back , there is no regret of missing an opportunity like this. Best Wishes. 

You should not. It might make matters worse for the referee who is still in the joint. Also there is no value for you in him knowing them. If you have to tell him , bluff him with people who have left the joint 

You should learn the current hot technologies in the market and practice them at home. e.g Java Basics , Advanced Java Spring Hibernate Database (Oracle/MongodB) Webservers (tomcat/jboss) . For front ends jquery , angular , node.js Look for a job near to entry position even if it means sacrificing some time/money ( salary wise ) Build something at home. If you are database oriented , you can look up BI / ETL products e.g Informatica/Datastage etc. 

If possible, checkout a open source product called twiki or a similar product. Check with your company , if you can use it to document everything you know. It is searchable by topics or keywords. You can use know how to write articles which might seem complex and try to explain and tag them with keywords. This way it stays as knowledge base and is accessible to anyone. Make sure that credit is attributed to you ( if you care ). It is very simple to use with many features. Of course you can also try to mentor someone. The risk is they leave 

We don't know how you stack up with your peers. Objectively , the company thinks you are not up there with them and went with their policy of rewarding employees who have exceeded the expectations. This means you need to work harder to get there. You might feel you have done an excellent job but there might be others who have done better. This should drive you to get a new job if you think it is unfair or you should motivate yourself to do better than others by working even harder. As for waste of 1 year , you surely must have learned many things at work and added to your experience besides earning salary . Maybe the most important thing you learned is managing your expectations. Best wishes. 

It depends on how marketable your skills are and the amount of experience you have. You have not mentioned in which industry is that you want to work ( financial/telecom etc ). Also depends on your visa situation. If you are a 7 out of 10 in the latest technologies and have us citizenship , you should bee able to land a job in a month or two . It also depends if you want to be full time or a contractor. Relocation packages are offered only to full time employees usually. Keep that in mind. If you move without relocation package , you can still write off moving expenses in tax filings. Can you resign your position any time and start work in 2-3 weeks ? If that is the case , you can interview any time. Most organizations expect you to join within 2-3 weeks and that is a factor in hiring. Please consider all above factors. 

You must ask your boss/supervisor. Only he can give you an objective opinion and some areas to improve on. The key is to work on critical /important stuff. Tools is alright but expertise is gained by working on complex/critical stuff which not only need development skills but other skills.( e.g domain knowledge, customer interaction etc ) 

It is always about presentation. Everyone wants more salary. It is how you say it. If you say that , you will have a lower rank in the number of people who have answered the question. But if you said , "I am looking for more challenges", then it is not so blatant and more tactful. the interviewer is looking for more tact than real answer. I have given you a general idea so go prepare your own answer. 

Just try to be "normal" as you are with your male friends or neighbors etc. DO not try to shy away. Speak with them casually , informally as friends. In about 2-3 weeks you will start feeling comfortable with them. in about 3-4 months , you will forget about all your shyness. Relax and do not put any pressure on yourself. 

My recommendation is to have one on one with him and talk frankly with him ( if needed take permission of whoever before talking ). Maybe someone needs to sit him down and tell him the reality for him to take his job seriously. Once this is done , you might notice a change in his attitude. If this happens , you can guide him in whatever he is lacking in a methodical way. 

I understand your concern. From the looks of it , your company does not have work to assign to you. You should accept that. Your management is not at fault as they don't have any work to assign. This does not mean your job is in jeopardy as they do have to keep maintenance personnel ready if something goes wrong. But since you are new , you must be eager to learn and work hard. For that you must start studying and job hunting quickly. Find out which jobs are available and are in demand and study accordingly of course keeping your interests in mind. Start looking for a job and quit only when you find one. Till then study hard in the field most jobs are open 

I don't think in-completion of any educational degree will turn up in background check. The things ( negative) that come up in background check are serious stuff like DUI/Criminal Activity etc. You have not done anything criminal. You should be fine. 

They would not care about this . The only thing they check is if you worked for that duration in companies as titles vary in the company. The position you mention is so far down in the past that it will not matter. By the way , the people doing the background checks are not the ones who interview. Do not sweat it , it is a non issue 

I understand your situation but i don't think the manager is at fault. you are giving him excuses for accomodation issues etc. This is not at all warranted as a professional. It sounds like a rant against the manager. He already told you the reason as to why he cannot keep you. I think what you should do is try to see how you can resolve the situation. For e.g sublease your apt for the next 2-3 months , look for new assignment , resolve any CPT issues. There is not much you can do against the manager or the co who hired you. Any employment can be terminated at any time . Look to the future and start resolving issues instead of being stuck on issues you cannot resolve. 

Use the right words in a sentence when replying in mail/person where there has been a mistake. e.g Them : are we done with git depository restructuring ? You : We are are still working on the restructuring of git repository. Rinse and Repeat. 

If I was you , I would refrain from promoting myself. As you said , they do not have an IT division and you are an intern. You/the company do not objectively know what needs to be done to successfully execute the project. As suggested by others, you probably need to work with an experienced IT team to understand the software processes better. 

I understand your problem. The guy is immature. Probably young in 20s. They do not understand the problem which may be caused by their actions. You have rightly identified him as a problem child. Stay away as much as possible. Don't try to argue.Be mature. Best of all , try to avoid any comments which might be perceived as bias. And if you do pass , be confident . Don't worry. Whatever you say to him bee confident and don't sound angry. Don't give attention to people who try to incite you. The more attention you give, the more they will incite you. Also be your natural self. Do not change because of bunch of bullies. 

The tests are a medium to test the coding skills of the participants . Common sense says do not copy paste. The participants went ahead and copy pasted the solutions. This indicates that they don't have the common sense of avoiding copy paste solution. The one who did not copy paste demonstrated skills plus common sense. It does not matter if the test was easy or difficult. The approach could have been reviewed even if they failed the test. My opinion , the three go out the door. The 4th one makes it to the next round. 

You should combine choices 2 and 3 of yours. There is nothing to lose. Don't get worked up and be nice and polite. Do not be afraid to be straight forward though ! 

Never chase a headhunter. Let him chase you. Be confident and stop all communication. If he needs you , he will come back. 

If you say No upfront , he will either cancel it or cut it short. You want to be diplomatic and tactful. Let him know your skills. If he is impressed , he will press you as to what you are looking for . Be vague e.g Looking for challenges/good salary etc. Always say " I will think it over and get back to you" if pressed against the wall. Never commit. You can ask him as to what his co offers for a guy of your experience ( general ballpark) and say it can help you in making decisions. 

You already answered your own question. You would rather work in IT than this new field. Long term the IT pay prospects are more. Job is easier and many things to learn. And why is that they would make you the business head of an unit ? Do you have the necessary qualifications ? Worse thing i read is you got this job through some family connection. My suggestion go for the IT job. 

Yes you can get a job. Do not worry about this before interviews. When you get selected and have the experience verification process you can deal with it then. You can provide the income tax returns/salary slips as proof if needed. Also some MNCs accept joining letter. Usually the verification personnel do all the verification by email/phone. You can tell them that you don't have the experience letter ( do not tell the reason ). They usually ask if you can provide any other proof ( salary slip / income tax record from company ) 

My suggestion is to go and meet the client and have a 1 on 1 with him. Ask him why does he want to implement the stuff at his office. Tell him frankly that there are 3-4 team members helping you and it will be difficult for all of them to work on site. You can suggest visiting him every other week and demo whats done and take more requirements/refinements till the project is complete.
