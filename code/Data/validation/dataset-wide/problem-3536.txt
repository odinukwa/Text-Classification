though they of course also have tables and links to more data. Or if you prefer raw data, the IRS SOI is available for 1996-2012. And of course there's Piketty and Saez seminal paper on the subject (See Table 5 for their data analogous to the included Wikipedia picture) And of course there's the BLS which publishes these things regularly by demographic, hourly only, or occupation/industry. 

Long Question: Overview: While I understand that over certain intervals (i.e. less than the width of the step), they may appear not to be because the step is outside of consideration, and over other intervals (much, much larger) the step seems continuous as opposed to discrete, but at the end of the day aren't these merely artifacts of the analysis, as opposed to properties of the underlying function? Admittedly, I was never much good with the calculus of discrete functions, but I remember there being some substantial differences between their derivatives (e.g. the need to invoke the finite difference method as opposed to a limit). Further, given the potential steepness of the step, and its unknown location, isn't predicting difficult? A Picture: For example, the graph below shows a cost function for $n$ units with and without a step. The red line is: $$C(n)=5n$$ and the blue line is $$C(n) = n+(n-\mod (n,5))$$ 

What are the causes of lower commodity prices? There is no secret: the demand is falling and the supply increase. The demand is falling mainly because of the slowing growth in China. As China imports less commodities to fuel its industry, a large chunk of the demand on these markets has disapeared, leading to lower prices. But simultaneously, the supply keeps steady or increasing on most of the commodity markets. On the oil market for example, 2015 has been a great year of surge or expected surge: OPEC countries are committed to keep flooding the market, mainly because the Gulf countries can afford lower prices thanks to low production costs, while their competitor might not sustain low prices very long. Furthermore, the ban on Iranian exports is going to be lifted, as well as the ban on US exports. The market anticipate already this formidable future new supply, which drives prices down. The US are quasi independent as far as Oil is concerned, as the Shale gas industry has been rising in this country. What are the consequences of lower commodity prices? The first consequence is not really caused by lower commodity prices, but rather by the root of this price drop: China's growth is slowing. Therefore their is more uncertainty than before about this market. As a consequence of this, exporters to China begin to worry as well as firms who have factories in China, as a slowing growth and reduced imports might be the sign of a stabilization and potential lower inner demand. China being one of the world's biggest market, and one with a still relatively low penetration for technologies, it is indeed worrying. Thus, the stock of a lot of companies have been going down all over the world because of the situation in China, reflected in Oil prices. Another very important factor comes into action: most firms in the commodity sector have huge debt. Indeed, this sector requires big investments to begin the exploitation. Among others, Glencore's $30bn debt has been discussed a lot, but it is only an example among many others. In particular, their are two areas that are under threat: shale gas and renewable. This two sectors require higher investment than others. For shale gas, because the exploitation is costly and technically complex. For the renewable, because the R&D is costly and the production as a whole is costly as it uses high technologies. Lately, the partial default of Abengoa gave us a taste of what might follow. The debt accumulated by this industry is by no mean sustainable with such low commodity prices. 

This set of lecture notes cites a bunch of great studies. Effectively, this lecture said that fiscal consolidation (austerity) might have been expansionary (good). The Federal Reserve, however says: 

So Reddit Economics yesterday posited and later retracted the above claim, and I was wondering, in the field of econometrics, are there any guidelines for how professions impact the national economy. The RIMS II and similar systems all focused on regional economies, and were largely driven by anticipated spending patterns, so consequently focused on the demand side of the equation. Is there an equivalent concept for GDP based on productivity or supply? Like a worker productivity (which I know is available in aggregate for current and historical US workers) broken down by NAICS/SIC code or other industrial designation? As a follow on, are there comparative studies I could reference that compare this measure across time and countries? (IE Mexican automanufacturer production post-NAFTA compared to Japanese electronic manufacturer ca ~1980). 

In order to understand how use of ARIMA models in Econometrics is a valid way to forecast economic variables, we must understand models which considers the case of for rational expectations (other wise referred to as efficient markets). your standard efficient markets model is: $$y_t=\tilde{y}_t+\sum_{i=0}^N\beta_i(X_{t-i}-X_{t-i}^e)+\epsilon_t$$ where: 

Ive noticed the use of univariate forecasting methods (i.e the ARIMA model) employed in forecasting inflation (see references below). How is this a valid approach in terms of forecasting economic variables? does this approach not omit the large amount of economic theory which determines how these variables are determined (i.e via equilibrium and interaction of variables other than themselves?) 

last year I asked How do we estimate production functions?. That answer provided was insightful from an econometric perspective and has helped me in applying such an understanding to the workplace. Right now Im doing some consulting by a small medical sales business and they wanted me to do a workforce evaluation of their sales staff, and they wanted to know if they should expand their workforce. The numbers they are giving me are on a monthly basis, they did not provide me with numbers of what their revenues are but they have given me quantities like the table below. (Note the numbers provided are fictitious). \begin{array}{c|lcr|} n & \text{Sales}&\text{Staff}{} \\ \hline 1 &103& 10\\ 2 &234& 10\\ 3&88&9\\ 4 &115& 8 \\ 5&63&9\\ 6&91&10\\ 7&130&10\\ 8&168&9\\ ...&...&...\\ \end{array} We know mathematically a production function provide us with a single value, however as we can see from this table, the quantities produced by the input above differs by time and period. How does one model such inconsistencies in production where the exact yield from inputs are not specific. 

Assumption and Question Given that many economic models can be viewed as Continuous Time Markov Chains, and that many chemical reactions are also described as such, have any experiments been conducted comparing a queuing model (for example) with an enzyme-mediated reaction? Inference If physical systems could be found that predictably react in a way that can be meaningfully correlated with models, could enzymes (or other physical inputs) be swapped (in a manner akin to tweaking variables), to allow for multiple simulations to be run simultaneously, especially with large sample sizes (given the order of magnitude of Avogadro's number)? Has this been tried, and is anyone publishing on such systems? 

Presumably, this occurred when a more qualified woman got a job over a male counterpart as women entered the workforce. Given that, one would expect the economy to grow substantially as overall productivity rose. Yet US GDP growth did not appear to outpace the world over that period, since not all the world liberalized their gender roles simultaneously. 

Your analysis of what demand curve represents is correct. Your confusion comes from the overly simplistic demand function that you chose. A "true" demand function would rather look like this: 

Public sector has different features than private sector. In particular, private sector is very much focused on limiting costs, because it is supposed to generate profits and is held accountable for this by the shareholders who have means to exercise direct pressure. A government isn't really accountable to anybody. Politically speaking, it is accountable to the citizen of course, but national accounting and public budgets are such complex things that citizen do not exercise a high pressure on the government. Moreover, the government doesn't seek profit maximization but utility maximization, sometimes with moderate focus on the costs. Running a deficit can even be seen as a positive argument by the electorate. Finally, one of the most prominent factor is historical: public sector employees have long had high benefits, sometimes to limit bribery, by cronyism or just because they were in a position to grant themselves such benefits (refer to the wages of the Greek MPs). And it is a very difficult task to take back this benefits without strong reticence, strikes and other forms of protests. 

In this paper (pdf), Peter Boettke goes into great depth explaining the difference between the two concepts in the Austrian school. Essentially information is any data that might influence an act (or specifically the perceived utility or cost of a choice), and knowledge is the information that the actor has already collected prior to the time they made their decision and/or engaged in their behavior. This helps to explain seemingly irrational behavior that is merely a manifestation of imperfect or asymmetric information (though it doesn't necessarily preclude or eliminate irrationality by any means). There is also some room for "false" (or conflicting) knowledge, to provide for further irrationality (in the sense that $A$ knows $U(x)>U(y)$ and $B$ knows $U(y)>U(x)$ where $U(x)$ is the average perceived utility of $x$ for all actors in the economy. He of course does a much better job explaining it than I do. 

The more problems you solve, the more accustomed you will become to economic logic and the language that comes with it. 

I'm experimenting with some data in R and I've found that though there is statistical significance between two variables, however their changes are not statistically significant. I first ran a standard regression of revenue on price, adding a quadratic term to account for diminishing returns from increase in price. Giving us the formula: $$y_{Revenue}=\beta_0+\beta_1Price+\beta_2Price^2$$ The results which were produced are: 

No this is not necessary and your estimates will be fine. Just remember to keep this in mind when your run your model. Hope this helps 

Though this graph has some controversy in terms of its empirical soundness. It is the basis of how we tie interest rate to unemployment. abstractly you can think of it as a "causal chain" being: $$\text{interest rate}\rightarrow\text{savings rate}\rightarrow\text{spending}\rightarrow\text{inflation}\rightarrow\text{unemployment}$$ Hope this helps. 

How can the bond market be overvalued? To value a bond, you need, as you mention, to discount future cash flows. The cash flows (or coupons) are fixed, but the discount rate is not, and every investor may have a different view on interest rates and hence price bonds differently. Therefore, someone thinking that interest rates will remain at rock-bottom levels will find different prices for bonds from someone who thinks that interest rates will rise sharply in the near future (the first investor will find higher prices). So, in your case, someone thinking that the bond market is overvalued simply has a different view on interest rates than the consensus on the market. To be more precise, they expect interest rates to increase faster than the market consensus. Bond Prices and interest rates Taking into account what we have said above, you can view the bond market as follows: every investor forms a view on discount rates, for a given bond. Doing so, they actually compute the yield, that is the discount rate that makes the NPV of the cash flows of the bond equal to 0. However, investors disagree on where the yield should be. They will thus trade the bond between them until they all agree. Let's take a numerical example : - Investor A owns a Bond, which has a face value of 100, a coupon of 1 and will mature in one year. - Investor A thinks that the yield of this bond should be 2% - Investor B thinks that the yield of this bond should be 0.5% The value of this Bond to Investor A is : $(100 + 1) / 1.02 = 99.02$ The value of this Bond to Investor B is : $(100 + 1) / 1.005 = 100.50$ Therefore investor A and Investor B will both improve their current state by trading the bond anywhere between \$99 and \$100.5, ie. Investor A should sell the Bond to Investor B. If the market price of the bond is \$100, then Investor A thinks that the bond is overvalued, and Investor B thinks that the bond is undervalued. 

Price discrimination is when a firm charges different prices for a homogeneous product to different consumers. In this example we see no such discrimination among consumers. This is just a case where there is competition between two firms. 

Well the problem can be dodged by the use of some simple solution of just adding a constant to all values which circumvent issues of taking logarithms of negative numbers. Usually the mean is used as a centering point. If the mean is negative though some other number must be chosen. Interpretation of such a transformed variable would be different from its regular logged counter part. These are just some hunches on what could have been done. Its odd that methods aren't mentioned for this case. 

We had a question on this site for Fundamental equations in economics. What I'd like to know is what are the most important proofs needed in economics?
