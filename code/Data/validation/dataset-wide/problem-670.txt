Determining an acceptable risk level is really a subjective personal assessment, no one can tell you whether or not something is of an acceptable level of risk. As such I will give you my judgement criteria for riding on roads shared with automobiles. 

It was late when I tried installing some replacement brake pads, and for some reason the top of the replacement pads wouldn't fit properly into the channel that is supposed to guide the pads (lower picture). I didn't realize the pads were sitting too low after insertion due to an awkward angle and tiredness (and general incompetence). As result when I squeezed the brake lever the pin got squashed (first picture below). Question Does this damaged pin warrant replacement? If so can this part be replace or does the entire caliper need to be replaced? I assume brake force is not transmitted through the pin, as it is soft material, but I am not a brake designer so I am not certain. Once I figured out the pads were not seating correctly, I knocked them in place with a rubber mallet and ran the brake. Braking doesn't seem to be affected. 

The short answer is yes. Tubeless tape will support using a tube just fine. Tubeless tape does not stretch (much) so the indentation at the spoke holes is very minor. Remember it is holding back the same force per square inch as regular rim tape, if it gave way the edge of the spoke holes would cut the tape and the tubeless tape wouldnâ€™t be doing its primary job of retaining air. Finally, while the adhesive does a great job of keeping tubeless tape in place, it can still shift if extreme lateral force is put on the tape (e.g., a very tight tire + tube+ rim combo)

Assuming the fitter correctly positioned the saddle set back for you, moving the saddle forward could result in more knee stress and the potential for repetitive stress injury. Keep an eye for early signs. Your knees, hips and IT bands could all show signs. Typically, the recommended order of operation in the fit is to first set the saddle height and setback, then set the handlebar reach. Saddle position is considered one of the most important positions for overall performance. I find it interesting that the more shorter reach setup relieved back pain. Usually a stretched out position affects the shoulders and neck. You should also look into if you have back and hip flexibility issues. Fit can accommodate flexibility issues, but shouldn't be a substitute for addressing the underlying issues as they likely affect other aspects of one's life. This is rampant speculation (take with a grain of salt), but do you sit a lot? If you slouch a lot while sitting you may have impacted your back and hip flexibility, giving you a more rounded back riding position and a shorter reach. As a final aside if you carry a load on the bike, shifting the pacement of the load ahead of the handle bars can return some of the handling characteristics.

The bicycle is a deceptively simple machine. The physics behind bicycles is actually quite complex, with multiple forces interacting to produce self-stabilizing behaviour (i.e., ghost ride a regular bike then run along and strike it, the bike will deviate from its current trajectory and self right). For a good rundown of the main physics principles behind this behaviour, see this short "MinutePhysics" video. The take home is there isn't a single optimal bicycle handling archetype, but rather there are multiple optimal solutions that are "better" at different use cases. To start to be able to answer which of your designs might be "better" we also need a clear use case and bicycle dynamics we wish to mimic. To further confuse the matter the reason bicycles are a intuitive to ride as they are (after an initial training/learning phase) is that balance on a bike also co-ops neural pathways in our brain dedicated to walking (i.e., when we walk we step into the direction we are falling and in the same way we turn into a fall on a bike). Coming up with a functional design that is "intuitive" to the end user will be somewhat complicated, as we must also understand how people walk. Taken together you may find an empirical approach (i.e., trial and error) may be the most effective. I would suggest creating a modular design that would allow you to easily switch between a single suspension beam without any "feedback" coupling, or a design with suspension beams. Ideally, you would also be able to dynamically adjust the level of feedback so you can vary it until it becomes more "natural." Finally, you mentioned 

There are two points to consider. As explained by @renesis even though you are exposed to pollutants, your overall exposure does not appear to differ significantly from car drivers (note the study was carried out in Copenhagen, I am not sure automotive how pollution regulations compare to the US). Because you are also getting exercise, your overall health outcome is likely better than remaining inactive inside a car. That said, there are ways to reduce your exposure. A 2008 study looked at the exposure by taking differ approaches to commuting: 

Depending on your goals you tend to weigh one category more heavily. For example, endurance riding tends to be more upright which prioritized (3) at the cost of (2). Saddle height tends to have the biggest impact on (1). Too low and you do not use all of the power stroke of the quadricepts, too high and you start leaving the power stroke and can over extend your hip and knee. The most powerful and efficient saddle height leaves a small bend in the knee at the end of the pedal stroke. This lets you use your quadriceps to the end of their power stroke without over extending. You will not be able to reach the ground easily while remaining on the saddle. Therefore to answer your question: 

Alternate Answer As a completely alternate answer that indirectly address your original question... you may also want to consider frame bags. These require no racks and mount directly to the frame, handle bars and seat post. There are lots of tutorials available on the internet, here is one from Adventure Cyclist 

1) Friendly tactics These tactics are intended to keep the competition friendly by letting your friend draft, but with the intent of making a decisive move at some point to win, which will clearly demonstrate that you were the stronger rider on the day. 

I avoid roads without a large shoulder or bike lane. While many still advocate for taking a lane, the failure mode (e.g., a rear collision) presents too much of a risk in my opinion. I avoid large speed differentials, I would qualify vehicles traveling over 50 kph as having a large speed differential. This reduces reaction times as the closing velocity is quite high, which can lead to accidents. I don't trust that most drivers are doing an effective job of scanning the road ahead of them. I also try to avoid roads with much traffic, either by riding in off-times (e.g., 5 am) or sticking to largely unused roads. This further reduces the risk. Finally, roads with good sight lines and acceptable closing speeds are preferred over roads with bad sight lines and higher closing speeds. (Thank you to @gerrit for the suggestion.) 

As a side note, other proprietary services such as Google maps also have good (and constantly improving) cycling maps. I however personally find OpenStreetMap is a little more up-to-date and accurate, likely due to the fact anyone can submit a fixes and new pathways. 

As suggested in other answers your saddle angle may be key. I don't know what your experience with Brooks saddles has been, but the set up tends to differ a little from more modern saddles, especially if you wear modern cycling clothing. Brook saddles tend to work like a sling and depending on how well you have broken your saddle in and the tension you have on your saddle you may find yourself sliding forward even when the saddle is perfectly level. If you haven't nailed your setup synthetic clothing may highlight this fact making it easier for you to slide forward. By comparison modern saddles often have textures that grip synthetics which may help offset any inaccuracies in setup. This problem is relatively easy to solve. On many models of Brooks I found that you generally need to keep the nose up ever so slightly higher than the back to keep your position. Because the saddles act like a sling you can can have the nose higher than more modern saddles without sacrificing comfort. Once I have the put the Brooks slightly nose up I found I remained firmly in place. If you do try this, make sure to take your time with small incremental adjustments. Setting the nose too high will eventually cause discomfort. Depending on how extreme you this may only show up on longer rides. So start for with a small change ride it for a while to see if it works for you, then adjust as apporpriate. I also found that as the saddle warms up I sink into the saddle a bit and find that it acts like a shelf for my sit bones, keeping me in place. I currently have my Brooks (Professional) set up such that I just creep forward at the start of the ride (when the leather is cold), but after a few minutes the leather warms up, becomes more compliant and I settle into position. After that point I don't slide forward for the remainder of the ride. Don't give up on your Brooks yet! I have never found a modern saddle that equals a Brooks in comfort on all day rides. 

Rampant Guess: Given how much Rohloff likely values their reputation (the hubs are hailed for their longevity under poor conditions) they are likely being extra cautious as the set up might produce poor results under some conditions. Gates belts require a lot of tension to operate correctly. This can be hard on hub bearings and could potentially twist a frame if is not designed for it. There is a lot going on inside a Rohloff hub, I suspect twisting could put important hub parameters out of specification, which could shorten the hub life. Being risk adverse to any tarnish on their reputation it sounds like they are trying to tightly control this potential problem.
