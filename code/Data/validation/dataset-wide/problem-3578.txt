Is it okay to workout in gym , when i am suffering from diarrhea ? or is it better to take rest that day ? Please give me some suggestions on this.... 

I started to workout in gym Age : 27, Male Height : 6.1 [184 ] Weight : 68 kgs [ 150 pound] [ Lightly active (moderate exercise but sedentary job)] usually i eat 50gms/110 pounds of protein per day , According to this link , if i want muscle gain, i need 179 Gm/393 pound protein , OMG is that much protein really required ? 

do i need to follow above ? I am a beginner & also is above statement depends on Intensity level ? currently i am working in LOW intensity ? 

Exercise also causes CNS (Central Nervous System) fatigue In a similar manner that your muscles/joints need to recover your CNS requires recovery as well. Extended CNS fatigue (ie > week is a key sign of overtraining). If you feel 'fried' get more sleep or take a break for a bit. Sleep, eating more calories, and reducing external stress should help. Here's a link for some additional tips to adjust your workouts for additional relief. Basically, it comes down to two things. Either don't do everything to the max all the time and/or or schedule for ample recovery (ie sleep/relaxation). 

I hear people on this site throwing the term 'Glycemic Index' a lot and I'd like to familiarize myself with how the GI of specific foods affect my diet. For instance, I have recently started eating potato bread instead of white bread and I'd like a way to compare the Glycemic Index of the two to see how the change will affect my current diet. Is there a particular source that's good for looking up the GI of specific foods (like Wolfram Alpha is for researching nutritional facts)? 

One ingredient that is key to any schedule is the long term viability. Based on the little bit of info presented, my concern would be burnout! As Christopher points out 2hrs. of weight training is high. Back in the day Arnold was quoted as saying anything longer than 1.5 hrs was too much...and we all know the kinds of drugs he was on! My suggestion is come up with a workout schedule for 6 weeks and know that in 6 weeks you are going to change it. Getting fit and staying fit is not a sprint...think marathon! I am currently a competitive cyclist and have played sports my whole life. I currently do 5/6 days a week on the bike for approx 12 hours of cardio and go to the gym at least 2 days a week for about 45 minutes each visit. I do core and ab work 4-5 times a week usually before cycling. There have been times when I was doing the opposite - 6 days of weight training and only cycling 1-3x weekly. IMO, try not to be overly rigid with yourself as that tends to lead to burnout! I am not suggesting no structure. My experience is the folks that find a middle ground tend to experience real results and dramatic change in life experience. Best of luck! 

i am working out in gym from last 3 months.... [ 4 days week , 30 minutes per day ] I want muscle , shape & want to be fit.... I did't saw any major improvements as i did't workout out intensively & did't took enough protein. [ maximum i was taking 50 g protein from food per day [ no other protein supplements ] , but i need atleast 120 g protein per day for my body weight.] also due to some reason i cant able to take more than 50 gm protein per day for next one month. after one month i can take up to more than 120 g protein per day. So is it better to go and workout in gym for next one month or is it better to skip gym for next one month , is there any advantage in going to gym for next month ? 

If you eat too soon before a workout your body is focusing its resources on digestion, especially if you eat a high carb meal. That may be part of why you feel sleepy. If the food is too high in carbs you'll most likely experience the 'comfort food' or 'food coma feeling' which will make you feel very sleepy. Another cause of the drowsiness is caused by the lack of a good warm up. Your energy levels aren't only regulated by food consumption. When you're working out it's also important to have enough oxygen and healthy circulation so your body can transport the resources needed to fuel your muscles. My suggestion has 2 parts. First, carb load the night before. Ie eat a healthy dinner that includes a lot of pasta and/ or rice the night before you workout. That way you have a large amount of readily available energy. Next, eat a light meal of mostly lean protein a couple of hours before you lift. Just enough to maintain your energy and provide some protein during the lifting but not so much that your body needs to invest too much energy into digestion. At the very least warm up properly before lifting. Nothing extreme just a light jog to raise your heart rate and get the blood flowing. 

From last 6 months , Due to very good diet & little bit cardio, i reduced my weight & fat [belly] , now i started to workout in Gym from few days for strength training & started to eat both carbs and proteins more than before.... seems like instead of muscles, again i am getting belly fat , how to get muscles without getting any little but fat ? What wrong i am doing here ? 

I am skinny fat , physically bit weak boy [ 26 age ] with 6.1 tall [ 1.83 ] and reduced my body weight from 78 kg [ 171 pounds] to 71 kgs [156 pounds] . still i have some belly and i wanted to eliminate that completely. along with that i want to get some shape and muscle. right now i am doing cardio 60 - 90 minutes per week and i am in calorie deficit diet. what i want to know is "I want to do strength training also" along with cardio. So how much cardio and how much strength training is not too much for me ? may i go with 5 days [ 30 minutes/day ] strength training & 3 days [ 30 minutes/day ] cardio per week ? 

There is a finite number of exercises. The key is to change the order both of the exercises and the days in which you do the exercises. The more you mix and match, the better the overall results. Additionally, if you write down each workout and build a plan, it is more likely that you will stay more engaged mentally. You will be able to track your exercises, weight and see improvements. For Example 4 Day workout 5 week block #1: Day 1 - Chest Back Shoulders: Flat Bench 5x10; Incline 3x10 Lat Pull Downs 5x10; Bent Over Rows 3x10 Military 3x10; Standing Side Lat Raises 3x10 Day 2 - Legs & Arms: Squat 5x10; Stiff legged dead lifts 3x10 Standing Barbell 5x10; Preacher Dumbbell 3x10 Day 3 - Chest Back Shoulders Incline DB Press 5x10; Pec Deck 3x10 Pull-ups 5x10(to failure); Seated Rows 3x10 Seated Dumbbell Press 5x10; Shrugs 3x10 Day 4 - Legs & Arms: Leg Press Sled 5x10; Hamstring Curl Machine 3x10 Seated Dumbbell Curl 5x10; Standing Cable Curls 3x10 Block #2 Day 1 - Back & Arms: Dead lifts 5x10; Bent over barbell 2x10; Stiff-legged Dead Lift 2x10 Day 2 - Chest & Shoulders: Decline Bench 5x10; Incline Dumbbell Press 3x10 Seated Military 4x10; Standing Front Lat Raises 3x10; Upright Rows 3x10 Day 3 - Legs & Arms: Squat 5x10; Leg Ext 3x10; Hamstring Curl Machine 3x10 Standing Dumbbell Curls 5x10; Seated Curl Machine 3x10 Day 4 - Back, Chest & Shoulders: Super-set - Pullups 5x10 (To Failure); Dips 5x10 (To Failure); Pushups 5x10 (To Failure); Shrugs 5x10(To Failure) 

Currently I am working on Chest & biceps [ Mon ] , Triceps [ Tue ] , Back [ Wed] , Shoulders [ Thu ], Legs [ Fri ] from Mon to friday.... Somewhere i read below : 

which is better option in below to reduce body fat 1)morning - 80 % protein , afternoon - 80 % carbohydrates , evening - handfull of nuts & eating only fruits at dinner. 2)taking carbs, proteins , fats & fruits for breakfast, lunch, dinner ? 

Mr.A & Mr.B, Mr.C all three workout in same level & eat same amount of protein & Carbs.... Mr.A sleeps for 9 hours.... Mr.B sleeps for 8 hours.... Mr.C sleeps for 7 hours.... Is Mr. A build the muscle early [ or more ] than Mr.C ? How much sleep really matters for muscle gain?.... In our Gym , some seniors tell they sleep only 6 hours due to lack of time, still they have good muscles!....

The concept is pretty simple. The better your body can circulate and provide oxygen to muscles, the better it will be able to process the byproducts of the strenuous workout. How you do so depends on what you're building up to. For instance: If you are training for long distance running, then you'll want to do more workouts in the aerobic range mainly due to the fact that more Type II muscle means more weight to carry and more resources (energy) you'll need to sustain the pace. As you may see on this site, many people like to bring up the topic of 'runners high' where you feel like you can keep going forever without getting tired. This is mainly due to the fact that your body is completely warmed up and effectively metabolizing in the aerobic (and therefore not creating any nasty byproducts) as well as releasing endorphins. As long as you can keep going without any functional issues (muscle strain, ligament pain, boredom) and you can maintain a healthy energy level, theoretically you could go forever. Unfortunately, your body doesn't have the ability to properly maintain itself (digestion, recovery, etc) during exercise. This is due to your body focusing it's resources on the 'sympathetic nervous system' during exercise as opposed to the 'parasympathetic nervous system'. If you're geared more toward weight lifting, higher intensity, short burst exercises, or other types of anaerobic activities like sprinting; The hard-and-fast rule is, 'the harder you workout the harder you will be able to workout'. This is mainly due to the fact that the more you push into the anaerobic range the better your body will adjust to be able to handle processing of the anaerobic byproducts. Fewer residual byproducts means less after-workout soreness. If you want specifics on 'why' that rule holds true, google the term 'anaerobic threshold' and spend some time reading up on the topic. Most people (including myself) were brought up to believe 'no pain no gain'. That is only partially true. You will feel some soreness/stiffness when you first start no matter what you do but pain does not equal progress. If you focus on increasing fitness first before strength you will have a much less painful path to progress (and you will probably be more healthy overall).
