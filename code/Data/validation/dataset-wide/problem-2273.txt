I've been climbing off and on since I was a teenager, but one thing I've never done much of is taping my hands. As I gained more experience, it's value is now apparent. What are some good techniques for taping fingers, hands, and wrists for different types of climbing, and how does each tape job achieve it's purpose? What type of tape is recommended or not recommended? For example: I'm having intermittent wrist pain. How can I supportively tape it, yet not restrict it too much, and also not completely cover the palm. Answers may relate to injury prevention or support, or just general protection of the fingers, hands, or wrist. Please be as descriptive as possible and pictures and/or videos are preferred in any explanations. Personal experience on effectiveness and tips with these tape jobs is also welcome and preferred. 

In Arborist climbing Your question was general enough to "climbing" that I decided to add this: In arborist climbing, sometimes putting a slip overhand knot in your trailing rope is useful as a backup to prevent an accidental descent. The slip knot is tied in such a way that if you descend onto it (meaning your hitch/device is butted up against it), it gets tighter and stops you. If tied in reverse, it would simply get pulled loose when descending and your hitch/belay device hits it. When tied properly, the slip-knot is effective and easy to remove when descending. In my experience, I have primarily used this for beginners for tree climbing as an added backup for them, tying multiple slip knots under them in case they inadvertently descend. When they are actually ready to come down, from the ground I simply pull down on the rope to remove the slip knots and transfer to bottom belay as a backup. 

Gaiters can be used on any shoes... even sandals. Of course their efficacy might be limited. The biggest thing to consider is how low the gaiters ride on the body of the shoe. If you cinch the bottom strap as tight as you can, yet the gaiter still rides up over the top of you shoe (usually at the heel, since the front likely has a hook keeping it attached to the laces) then rocks can get in. Try a smaller size. Small gaiters, snugged down have worked well for me in any number of sneakers / running shoes, etc. In snow, the success rate is more limited, since even with boots, snow tends to pack in under the bottom lip of the gaiter - it just has farther to go up the heel of a boot than up the heel of a shoe. 

The only way to judge the depth of water with any certainty is to get in it, swim around, and dive repeatedly to the bottom searching for objects (trees, boulders, the body of the last person who leaped before the looked.) Sure there may be ways that can help you estimate depths to degrees (see Rory's answer) but the odds you have a good visual on anything but the clearest of still-water lakes are pretty slim. 

As with any wild animals, different species and different individuals are going to respond differently in different situations. Some snakes are extra-ordinarily docile, and no amount of heavy-stomping will disturb them, unless you stomp on them. So, to answer the original question, walking with heavy footfall is neither foolproof, nor sustainable for long hikes: resulting in very sore feet at best, and stress-fractures at worst. Best is to keep an eye on your surroundings, and be careful not to place your foot somewhere you can't see what might be lurking around it - ie, stepping over a log, walking beside an overhanging rock, in deep grass, etc. Stepping on a snake is an obvious no-no, but even passing within striking distance can result in an attempt depending on the disposition of the particular animal. 

A fingerboard, hangboard, and training board all refer to the same thing: a device used to train for climbing that mounts on a wall or other vertical surface to improve strength and endurance. 

For information on specific sections I recommend a guidebook for the particular section being hiked. There are several available. The Appalachian Trail Conservancy offers these guidebooks which are quite detailed, and may be found in many outdoors stores near the AT as well as online. Another kind with a digital version is offered here from the ALDHA. Downloads are free for ALDHA members only. It seems you'll have to pay for pretty much any type of guide, but it's worth it usually. While the primary purpose of these guidebooks is mostly to educate about the trail and the area, you could likely infer specific etiquette from that information if needed. And finally, go to a local (not a chain) outfitter/outdoors store in the area you're visiting. They will likely have good information and be up-to-date on the local trails. Also many regions have specific hiking clubs and associations that maintain websites with a good amount of information and people to contact. 

As seen in the photos of the repair kits below, the wick is the fabric-like material which is made of fiberglass. It doesn't burn but does eventually degrade when exposed to the high heat of a stove. A simple replacement wick could potentially be fashioned out of nearly any fiberglass insulation such as that used in home construction. Furnace filters are often made of fiberglass filter media. It is also often used (usually bonded with other materials) as thermal insulation in automobiles to isolate the engine and exhaust heat from the cabin of the vehicle. If used from one of these type of sources, make sure the fiberglass itself is free of any other combustible materials or glues. These are simply a few applications where fiberglass insulation is used as it has become quite a ubiquitous material. Another possible source is the wick from a lantern. Even with different fuel types, most lanterns I've ever seen use fiberglass for the wick. However there are so many lantern types and brands out there that you'd need to research the exact type for yourself. But the main thing is to make sure that it's made of fiberglass or other fire-retardant material. This page has some good information on wick material. It mentions Kevlar and Nomex as some viable, though more costly alternatives to fiberglass. Cotton is mentioned but isn't a good material for this application as it will burn up and soot up the stove. Optimus Nova Repair Kit: 

This isn't pretty, and seems to be somewhat limited in locations (I couldn't get it to work for my area) but this looks to have potential. Though there is no "subscribe" feature. National Weather Service Weather Activity Planner (Example) 

Not fast enough? Add more dogs. (Though I can't in good conscience recommend more than 18. And make sure your brakes work...) 

I would wager that such a thing does not exist. Of the attachments you mention, only one (sharp spear) seems practical. Issues with the others: 

By engaging in winter sports (where there is significant snow on the ground) you are already greatly reducing your impact. The biggest impacts to back-country areas from non-motorized recreation come from vegetation disturbance: boots grinding up plants and breaking topsoil, tents compressing vegetation, camp activity destroying vegetation, fire scars, etc. A few inches of snow will largely protect the fragile flora beneath provided there is enough snow that you are not punching through to the soil/vegetation below. Thus, xc-skiing, snowshoeing, snowboarding, and downhill skiing will leave absolutely no trace of your passing -- again, provided there is enough snow. You do mention the tops of saplings sticking up. Avoid them. If when you pass on your board you see broken saplings in your wake, the snow is not deep enough. Use common sense. As for local fauna - they're all pretty used to hiding in holes anyway, and your passing by on skis likely won't disturb them. (A major exception is elk and deer calving grounds, which are often identified on US public lands maps, and are usually closed to snowmobiles and sometimes skiers.) The impacts you DO need to be concerned about are waste, trash, and etc. that easily get buried beneath snow where they seemingly "disappear." Pack it in, pack it out. Of course, the biggest impact from non-motorized winter recreation is the motorized facilities of ski resorts which consume vast amounts of electricity to haul people up on lifts, diesel fuel to run snow cats that make those perfectly groomed trails, and development impacts that can encroach into wild lands. 

Remove the igniter from the stove. Take a fine file or sandpaper and make sure there is only clean metal on the electrode tip. Often times these get corroded and dirty. Use a Scotch-Brite pad or steel wool to clean the burner itself so that it also exposes clean metal. DO NOT use sandpaper on the burner. Get some electrical contact cleaner and spray it directly into all orifices of the igniter. Also spray out the burner to clean out any dirt and dust. It's recommended that you wear gloves while doing this. Shake the ignitor and the burner to remove any excess cleaner and let it dry for 10-15 minutes. Reinstall the igniter in the stove and position the tip of the electrode about 1/4" or closer from the surface of the burner. Try to ignite and check for spark. If you still don't get a consistent spark, replace the igniter with a new one. 

This began as a comment but quickly began to grow, so I suppose now it's my supplementary answer to studiohack's great answer. 

This question honestly could be too localized on these specific products. However, considering the ubiquity of these stoves I find it is probably quite useful information to know if they could have interchangeable parts. MSR's Whisperlite International & Universal stoves are very similar products, but they have some fairly notable differences. Let's call the Whisperlite International the WLI and the Whisperlite Universal the WLU just to make it a bit easier. Let's look at the WLI & WLU parts first: 

There are two types of water-based concerns while doing strenuous activity in the desert: dehydration and hyponatremia. Dehydration occurs when your body is not getting enough water, and is the most common. Symptoms include irritability, headache, lack of energy, bright yellow/orange and infrequent urine. You lose water while you sweat, but in hot climates you don't necessarily notice since it evaporates so readily. Along with that water, you also lose electrolytes (salts and minerals) that your body needs. Lose too much of those, and drink too much water without replacing them, and you tip the balance in the direction of hyponatremia. Hyponatremia (which the questions linked allude to) is a very serious condition on the other end of the scale that occurs when one drinks too much water without replacing the salts sweated out. It is affecting more and more people exerting themselves in hot climates due to our increasingly "sodium free!" diets. Your body needs salt to function, and as you sweat, you lose that salt (and other nutrients) which water alone will not replace. Usually this isn't a big issue, and the salts get replaced with meals etc. But if you are sweating a lot and drinking anything (water or sports beverages) to excess, hyponatremia can set in. Symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, nausia, irritibility, disorientation, dizzyness, vomiting, seaizures, coma and death. It is not to be taken lightly. Interestingly, some of these symptoms are the same as dehydration... but if you are experiencing the above while your urine is still clear and copious (likely because you have dutifully been pounding drinks down) it is probably hyponatremia. Prevention: 

Tie the knot that you and your partner or group are absolutely confident in and can inspect without having to even think about it that hard. You might think it's silly, but if you can't tie the knot with your eyes closed, you probably shouldn't use it until you can. Whatever the knot, it should become second-nature, and then you and your partner still need to check it. 

Without having to carry any extra items and thus extra weight, this is what you can do to dry your boots, Gore-tex or otherwise, in the field, in above-freezing temperatures: 

In peak season (late spring/summer) most trail etiquette on the AT relates to thru-hikers, but not all of it, and generally is about the same on the whole trail. Thru-hikers are of course those who are continuously hiking the entirety of the Appalachian Trail, north or southbound. This information is essentially entirely based on my experience on the AT and hiking in general for many years. In short, simply be polite and respect others and the wilderness in which you find yourself. Leave things better than you find them. In more detail, general etiquette is the following: 

Quite simply, find someone else who is doing this and has been doing it for a quite a while and is willing to teach you. This sport is quite technical, and you can't do it (safely) alone anyway. One possible way is to find a company that guides canyoneering trips and get a seasonal job with them where they train you. At the very least you could make a connection with someone that works there that will help you. And if you get such a job then you also get to make some money while learning, which is always a good thing. In the meantime you can look for books on the subject to help increase your knowledge base once you find a canyoneering partner/teacher. There are many online resources as well to learn basic concepts. Many of them seem to be geared toward canyoneering in the US, but the same principles apply anywhere. This site is one such example. 

Simple, straight forward. And you can do it without any specialized medical kit. All bandages provide you is a sterile method for doing the last - but in lieu of sterile dressing, any clean barrier from dirt will do. (ie, a clean shirt) Adding any kind of substance (ie, honey, plant poultice) is generally frowned upon in wilderness settings as these can introduce sources of infection, become breeding grounds for bacteria, or at the very least make it difficult to monitor what is going on with the wound. If you are far enough away from higher care that infection is a concern, then these "home remedies" are generally considered more risky than helpful, and add one more thing you have to clean out of the wound later. 

According to this blog: $URL$ it simply refers to Arc'teryx getting into the down game at all (previously having no down offerings). With respect to hydrophobic down, the entry states: 

Death (or paralyzation) is less progress than re-tracing your steps. Of course, if you are in a life-or-death situation (eg, jump or the raging wildfire will consume you) then play the odds. 

Even for "multi-week" trips, brushing with water alone is not going to compromise your tooth health. The abrasive action of the brush does most of the work, and missing the flouride hit for a few days won't affect your teeth in the least. Plus, it saves weight. So, the best LNT option: don't use it. If you MUST use toothpaste (or an alternative), try a few of these options:
