First, you have to realize that "study up on documentation" is legitimate work. It may be boring and not much fun, but it is probably necessary for you to do and ultimately good for your productivity in the long run. You're not wasting time, you're learning, and they're paying you to do it. As long as you make it clear to your boss when you're done with whatever assigned task he has given you, then there is not much more you can do. If his answer is "go read another manual", then go read another manual. Of course reading manuals is only the start to learning. You then have to apply what you've read about to make it stick better. Instead of just reading a manual, sit down and try to use whatever the manual described. Unfortunately you don't say what these manuals are about or what your job is, but go play with the equipment described, write some code, set up a test, or whatever. Then go to your boss and say something like "I've read the Dominator-2000 manual, then hooked it up to the frommulator and got it to babulate. I couldn't get the variable grommulus to work at first, but hooking it to the fribomatic worked. I think I've got a pretty good grasp of the Dominator-2000 now. What do you want me to do next? I think I could interface the Dominator to the test platform for the new project now.". It's hard to say, but maybe even this is what he's waiting to hear. 

Don't send a thank you letter (or email) if that's the only thing it says. Think of it from their point of view. It conveys no information and only wastes their time. You are probably contemplating this because you feel the need to keep pinging them in the misguided hope that this will somehow increase your chances of getting a offer. Wrong. They interviewed you. They clearly know you exists and have a reasonable amount of information on you. The next steps are up to them, which they will execute at their speed using their process, influenced by a lot of things you have no way of knowing about. Trying to subvert this process will only be annoying to them and will make you look like a childish weenie (Have I got the job yet? Huh? Huh? Well, do I?). If you have some follow up information that was discussed during the interview, you can send a message with that. However, if the interviewers wanted to allow you to contact them, they would have given you their business cards. Thanking someone when they haven't actually gone out of their way for you can be perceived as insulting. You are basically saying that you think they are so childish that they need to be thanked for something that was a normal part of their job. Don't be that weenie. 

You are making this too complicated. First you worked for company A, then you worked for company B. List it that way with the appropriate start/end dates. In the description of your duties for company B (which should be listed first since employment history should be in reverse chronological order), explain what you do. You can also explain that B was spun off from A. For your duties for A, you can either use a abbreviated version of what you wrote for B, or refer to the B description outright, explaining that at that time, A did what B does now. It would be good to mention you left A to go to B because B was spun out of A. That wouldn't count as a job "hop" against you then. However, take a deep breath and step back a little. This isn't that big a deal. Mostly those reading the resume just want to see what kind of work you did and how often you hop around. If the work looks relevant but the details a little confusing, they either won't care or will ask you about it later. 

Clearly that interviewer thinks you're a waste of time to interview. It is unlikely a mind game is being played here. That reason for the short interview could be because: The interviewer doesn't think the company needs a new person in that role. The interviewer knows the company isn't really going to hire someone in that role. The interviewer thinks you're totally unsuited for the job. 

Callers that won't explain the real purpose of a call are invariably a waste of time. Those that have legitimate business with a particular person aren't going to be offended if you ask them to explain a bit. Think about it the other way around. If you needed to talk to a specific person at a small company about a particular issue, and whoever answered the phone asked what the issue was, you wouldn't be offended, surprised, or think less of the person or company in any way, right? I usually handle this very bluntly: "Part of my job is to screen calls for Mr Xxx, so I need to know what this is about.". Those with legitimate business are going to recognize it for what it is, a first line of defense against annoyance calls. They get them too, so will understand why you need to do this. Also, by saying it's "part of my job", you remove the opportunity for them to negotiate. It's your job, you were told to do this, they aren't going to be successful in telling you not to. For many years I was a consulting engineer with my own company. Occasionally there were others to answer the phone, but often I answered it. The spam calls were usually obvious in the first few seconds. The best method was to pretend I was a low level employee when someone asked to talk to the manager, CEO, or whatever. The line about it being my job to screen calls usually worked very well. I also took some additional steps to make this process easier. When some organization asked for a contact person, I'd make up a name with the initials reminding me of the organization. Not only does this immediately identify someone just looking thru listings of CEOs and the like, but you can tell which directory they are looking in. For example, David Baker gets the most calls. He is listed as the CEO by Dunn and Bradstreet. Mike S Conner gets some calls to, and is listed by the Massachusetts Software Council. For a while we did some work related to computer companies, so you can probably guess who Henry Pollard and Ingrid B Miller are. A typical phone call goes like this: Caller: This is xxx from yyy company. I'd like to talk to Mike Conner. Me: I'm sorry, he's not in right now. Can I help you?" If it's a legitimate call, then the caller will explain what it's about. After all they have no relation with Mike Conner and have obviously never talked to him before. On the other hand if it's a spam call, as 98% of those asking for Mike Conner are, it becomes obvious right here. There will be some excuse as to why they need to talk to him urgently, why they don't want to explain a lengthy issue to me, etc. Usually they just repeat something vague, like "It's an important business issue.". No legitimate caller is ever going to say that. Depending on my mood at the time, I either just hang up or engage them for a while for my personal amusement and occasionally the amusement of others watching this. Anecdote: A bunch of years ago I got one of these calls for David Baker. After the usual intro, the caller said "I was just talking to him and we got cut off. I need to talk to him right away. I'm at the airport about to get on a plane." I told him I didn't believe him, and that he was a liar probably just flipping thru the Dunn and Bradstreet listings contacting CEOs. There was a long silence at the other end, then "Um, ... Um, ... I'll call back later.". For more amusement: In recent years there have been a lot of calls wanting to "verify information". These are obvious attempts to get lists of officers with contact info at companies. When I don't feel like playing, I'll just say "We are privately held and don't give out such information.", then simply hang up if they try to argue. On other occasions I go further. I keep a sticky note on my monitor of fictitious names of corporate officers complete with email addresses. My email server is set up to blacklist any IP that sends to one of these addresses. What makes this particularly amusing (to me at least), is that these are all real villains from history. The president is Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, the operations manager Benito Mussolini (he makes things run on time), the head of security is Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, and the marketing manager Joseph Goebbells. I have given out various of these names dozens of times, but incredibly, nobody has ever been skeptical, told me I was pulling their leg, or appeared to do anything other than take these names at face value. Perhaps it helps that I initially refer to them with nicknames, like Vlad, Benni, Lav, and Joe, but I always end up spelling the full names. One time I even had a lady remark "Benito Mussolini, what a nice name.". No, that really happened! 

It means they made you a offer, looking for "yes" or "not yes". They were not interested in negotiating, so "blah blah negotiate blah blah more money blah blah" is just a long winded "not yes". You priced yourself out of this job. It's over. Move on. Others have mentioned you might be able to respond with "No, wait, wait, I'll take the lower offer. I was just seeing what I could get away with. Now that you've shown you mean business, I'll come crawling back." but I disagree with that. They were willing to hire you at the original price. However, now that you clearly won't be happy at that price, you are no longer a fit for that job. I wouldn't hire you in this situation either, since I'd figure you're just going to be here temporarily while you look for a better job, probably on company time. No thanks. The quickness and firmness of their response means one of several things: They were a bit on the fence about you or there was some internal disagreement. Your response pushed it over the edge to "definitely not him". They have a fixed budget. The original offer already maxxed this out, or close to it. The people doing the hiring don't have room to negotiate, whether they would like to or not. They have at least one other good candidate. As soon as you proved to be high-maintenance, they dropped you like a hot potato and immediately made the other guy a offer. He accepted, so now they didn't need you anymore and can blow you off in the most expedient way possible. 

I'm not a lawyer, and have no experience in the UK. However, it seems strange to me that there would be anything wrong with a person volunteering at your company for reasons of their own. Common reasons are to get some experience in a new field they wouldn't otherwise be qualified to work at, or don't have a job and want to stay active and current rather than sitting around. So the answer is to look at this not from the point of view of employment, but rather as a volunteer situation. That may put it into a different legal perspective. Surely there are charities in the UK that accept volunteer help, so this must be a well-trodden path. 

Threatening your boss, which is what giving him a ultimatum is, is just not a good idea. Ultimately the company gets to define your working environment, and you get to decide whether that job, as defined by the company, is worth it for you. Trying to force change for your comfort usually doesn't work, and usually leaves resentment no matter how it is addressed (or not). In this case, the obvious answer is to continue looking for alternate employment. It's a good thing to know what your options are. Maybe you even discover a better job than what you'd have even if they fixed the George problem. Then also go to the boss and ask him when to expect that re-assignment. If you get it, or are convinced you will get it, before you find a better job, great. If you find a better job, great. If neither happens then continue looking for that better job until you find one. 

You don't always see that. It may be normal boiler-plate text for that company, but it may also be a hint that they concluded that you didn't know enough and were too inexperienced. If you were trying to reach to a more senior position, then there may be some real content there. Or not. 

In the end, you probably can't fix Bob, and you probably can't get the company to do anything about Bob, even with the boss being sympathetic. Unfortunately that's life sometimes. You'll have to evaluate how much this really bothers you, and how much you want to do this particular job versus other possibilities. 

During lunch and breaks, eat lunch and take a break. A short break can increase your productivity afterwards. If you're really in the middle of something, hot on the trail of a bug, in the groove and cranking the code, or whatever, skip the break. The point of a break is to give you a chance to catch your breath and relax a bit. If that would help, catch your breath and relax a bit. If not, just keep going. Trying to cram some other deliberate activity into a short break defeats the purpose, and probably doesn't give you enough focus time on the activity to do much meaningful. 

This depends on what kind of relationship you have with your boss at your current company. If you have a generally cooperative and honest relationship, then be nice and give them the most possible warning. Don't just say "I'm outta here in 4 weeks.". Something in a more cooperative spirit would be better: "I'm leaving in 4 weeks. I'm telling you this now because Acme Company and you have always been fair to me, and I want to give you the most time to plan and figure out how I can best use my remaining time to make this as smooth as possible for you.". Unless the boss really can't stand you and was looking for a opportunity to dump you, you're not going to get terminated early. Don't be surprised if a lot of your remaining time is spent making sure whatever you worked on is properly documented, and your current project is transitioned to someone else. That's just how this works, and should not be taken as a insult or lack of confidence in your abilities. The worst the existing company can do is lay you off on the spot, in which case you'll still get paid for 2 of the 4 weeks at minimum, unless you have a very unusual employment contract. However, the upside is more substantial. You may not need anything from your current company now, but it's always good in the long term to leave on good terms. Next job change, being able to use your current boss as a reference could be quite valuable. It's never good to burn bridges behind you. In fact, it's worth some effort and some risk to try to do the opposite. By giving them early notice, you do them a favor on the way out. Unless your boss is a complete jerk, that won't be forgotten.
