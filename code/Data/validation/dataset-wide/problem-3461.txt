Quick answer, as I'm on my phone, but product by product input output tables can be obtained from Eurostat for EU countries, and are probably your best bet. Individual countries may have more detail from their own National Statistical Institutes' websites. The production functions in these are derived under some fairly strong assumptions, though, and you're certainly not going to get 30000 products worth of detail! OECD also have some as well, and there are a number of multi-country input output tables available. I hear SE Asia do this well, but I don't know what data are publicly available. Countries which use hybrid transformations to produce IO tables may be able to provide you with their technology assumptions matrix, which might help you distinguish joint production from by-production. This is all quantitative data, though, and you need to be careful about imports. If you can get an imports matrix as well, that would help, although if you're only looking for qualitative info, if you stick to tables for larger economies the problems should be mitigated. You might be able to find more detail on a qualitative basis elsewhere, but I'm afraid I don't know from where. Editing to add links and further detail: Eurostat collect datasets from EU members and make them available here. Note that some of the tables will be industry-by-industry (IxI) rather than product-by-product (PxP). The former will do in a pinch, but it's not strictly what you're after. OECD provide data for a wider range of countries as part of their STAN database but again these are IxI. The UK do produce PxP tables under a hybrid technology assumption, available here but I would add the caveat that the UK have not carried out a full purchases inquiry since before a change in classification from SIC 2003/NACE Rev. 1 to SIC 2007/NACE Rev. 2, so you could see the odd spurious cell as a result of the correlation matrix method used for their conversion. Your best bet (at least as far as IO tables go) is probably the tables produced by the US BEA. Their Total Requirements: Commodity by Commodity table (also known as the Type I Leontief inverse) has a 389 commodity breakdown. This isn't a PxP table as such; each cell shows (in monetary terms) how much of each input (labelled on the row) is needed to make one unit of output of the product labelled on the column in the whole domestic supply chain. It sounds like you want something more like a direct requirements matrix, which gives only the things directly used to make that product, not including the things used to make the things used to make the product, and the things used to make those etc. etc. For this you want the direct requirements matrix, which is unfortunately only provided on an IxI basis. You might want to go ahead and use this, or you could try to back out the direct requirements matrix (also known as the A-matrix) mathematically. Ordinarily I'd say just invert your total requirements matrix and subtract EDIT(it from) the identity matrix, but looking at the spreadsheet I'm seeing some negatives, which shouldn't happen with a Type I Leontief inverse by construction so I'm not sure what's going on there; I'm guessing some of final demand has been endogenised. It may be worth digging into their methodology or getting in touch with BEA to discuss this. They may even be able to directly provide you with something suitable. You'll likely find that there are a lot of cells with (relatively) very small values in either approach; for a qualitative analysis I'd suggest setting a threshold value and setting anything below it to 0 and above to 1, or just picking the largest n cells in each column to look at. One final caveat: Product-by-Product tables are basically never compiled from directly collected data, and are in a sense an inherently synthetic beast. Instead they are constructed from Supply and Use tables, which are much closer to directly collected data. These both have product-by-industry dimension, with the supply table showing what each industry produces, and the use table showing what each industry consumes. If you can make use of those instead, then that's preferable to using IxI or PxP tables. If you want to learn more about input-output, I can recommend some books. The first is "Input-Output Analysis: Foundations and Extensions" by Miller and Blair, which seems to be the bible among academics on the subject (I would add a warning that I find their presentation of the Type II Leontief model suboptimal for applied work, but this shouldn't be an issue here). Thijs ten Raa has a book, "The Economics of Input-Output Analysis" which is a bit more high level (not to mention shorter!). If you don't want to fork out the cash, the Eurostat manual on Supply, Use and Input-Output Tables is available online but is heavily geared towards construction of the tables themselves. If you're looking for detail on how Supply and Use tables are converted to Input-Output tables, my favourite mathematical presentation online is actually that from the 1968(!) version of the UN System of National Accounts which you can get from the UN here. There's also a UN Handbook on Supply, Use and Input-Output Tables due to be published sometime this year, which I'd recommend looking at when it's finally published. 

Industrial Organization is the field concerned with estimating supply and demand relationships in individual product markets. You can see for example Einav and Levin for a description of what empirical IO people are up to. The specific models are usually much more complicated than what you learn in Mankiw, tailored to specific markets, and very strong assumptions are required to estimate them. For recent IO papers, you can see for example the NBER working paper series. 

What you want to compare is M1 and the currency component of M1: $URL$ Trading Economics is a bad source. 

The money goes to banks/brokers. In fact most of the revenue in the financial sector comes from fees like that. This is to compensate the bank/broker from taking the risk of carrying the opposite position on their books for a while, and the labor put into actually trading for you. A part of it is probably also profit. Since there are large entry costs, one would expect the financial sector to earn profits. 

This is/was a huge topic in macro and labor. Traditionally, macroeconomists calibrate models that require huge labor supply elasticities to match the data. Then labor economists estimate labor supply elasticities from micro data and find very very low elasticities. Imo the labor estimates are more trustworthy than the macro calibrations. Check out $URL$ for a summary of the issue and citations to the further literature. 

If this is your definition of "post-scarcity economics" then you need not look very far though. Over the last 150 years, technology has greatly reduced the need for human labor required for production of an 1850s consumption basket. Indeed people had that same debate in the 19th century (see Luddites), then again in the 1930s (see Keynes' famous essay on Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren) and again today. Of course stuff is still as scarce as ever, and society is qualitatively organized much as it was 100 years ago, except that of course everybody is much better off. 

There is a lot of newish research on the adverse consequences of Globalisation and more generally De-industrialization on low skilled workers in developed economies. A good place to start is Autor, Dorn, Hanson in the AER 2013. David Autor has other interesting work on this topic as well as on automation. Your questions have quite a normative ring to themselves, and it seems to me you already know what kind of answers you want. It is true that discussing the adverse effects of Globalisation or technological progress on some people in rich countries has become a more active research topic. But I think most people are very still far from questioning free trade or technological progress as Pareto efficient. And I think the overwhelming majority of economists still thinks that industrial policy in a developed country is a silly idea. So I don't think you are going to find this big trend you are looking for. Also, as a sidenote, even development economics has moved quite far from the kind of research that debated the industrial policy you have in mind. It's mostly about RCTs and institutions now. 

I am by no means an expert on this, but maybe this helps. Here is a simple example for a bellman equation $V(y) = \max_x u(x,y) + \beta V(y')$ $s.t. \, y' = f(x,y)$ This is a functional equation in an unknown function V. A solution to this problem is a function V that satisfies the equation above. If you look at the equation, it's pretty clear that the solution has to be a fixed point of the operator on the RHS of the bellman equation: if you take the correct V and an arbitrary y and calculate $\max_x u(x,y) + \beta V(y')$ $s.t. \, y' = f(x,y)$ you will get $V(y)$. The operator that is the RHS of the Bellman equation operates on functions, and the solution is a fixed point in some space of functions. It's a different question whether this fixed point exists and how to find it. Here, you appeal to the contraction mapping theorem: under typical assumptions on u and provided $\beta<1$, the maximization step above is a contraction mapping for any guess of V. This means that there exists a unique fixed point V, and you can find it by successive iteration. 

Understand that I'm a total novice with regard to economics. Also, while I ultimately have an axe to grind (doesn't everyone?) I'm not trying to do that honing here, I'm simply looking for a sanity check on my "logic" (such as it is). I don't propose to discuss political implications here. President Trump is proposing a "tax reform" package that is roughly estimated (based on two separate sources I found) at about $5T over 10 years. Let's assume that the cost of this package is not significantly offset by spending cuts (at least not cuts that would exceed proposed spending increases in other programs). So it's reasonable to assume that basically the entire amount would be borrowed, through Treasury securities and similar instruments. Here it gets a little shaky. Several sources tell me that foreign sources own about 1/3rd of the US government debt. While it's obviously difficult to predict how much of the new debt would be purchased by whom, it's a reasonable spitball estimate to assume that about a third would be sold overseas, assuming interest rates remain at least as high as they are currently, and barring any significant change in overseas perceptions of the soundness of US securities, or of the US economy in general. This means that foreign sources must come up with about $1.7T in US currency over ten years, thus removing the ability of that much US currency to purchase goods and services from the US (or benefiting from that much US currency being paid out of the US to buy foreign goods and services). (The objection will be made that money is, uh, fungible, and so currencies other than US currency can be used to purchase US goods. But if I spend my US dollars on T-bills then I will have to convert my rubles to dollars if I want to spend more dollars on US goods and services, and that conversion drives up the "cost" of the dollar, making US goods and services less "attractive". When it balances out the net-net is to have removed that much US money from the pool of cash available to fund US exports.) The cost to "create" a job in the US seems to be variously estimated at between \$40K and \$100K a year. (I couldn't find any sources that were clear and explicit enough to be worth referencing, alas.) (Most such estimates appear to be orientated towards tech sector jobs, and presumably manufacturing jobs would be "cheaper".) But let's say that a job "costs" $50K/year -- we are "spitballing", after all. So, dividing the \$1.7B by \$50K times ten years, I come up with 3.4 million jobs lost for a period of ten years, due to the proposed tax cuts. Where is my "logic" here weakest? Is my spitball aim terribly off anywhere? Are there fatal flaws, or is it simply too fuzzy and "out there" to assess without losing your lunch? Note: I'm trying to understand the above (presumed) effect in a vacuum of sorts, without considering any of the counterbalancing benefits of deficit spending and related issues. Basically, I'm only looking for criticisms of my "math", and a "but you forgot about ..." answer is only relevant if it somehow modifies or negates that "math". Yes, deficit spending has supposed benefits, but I'm not asking about that. 

As I understand it, if the US government runs a deficit then it (for the most part) "pays" for that deficit by "selling" government bonds. This tends to drive up interest rates somewhat, but also, since the US government is so "trustworthy" as a debtor (and pays fairly attractive rates), it attracts investment from non-US sources. The net of this is that running a deficit will tend to raise the "value" of the dollar (affect exchange rates) since money coming into the country to buy bonds must ultimately be "bought" with other currencies, and supply/demand dictates that this one-way flow will drive up the dollar and drive down the currencies being exchanged. The question is, is there some way to (very roughly) calculate HOW MUCH the value of the dollar is affected by the deficit and associated bond sales? This would imply of course having some rough estimate as to what % of bonds are bought by non-US buyers and also some way to estimate how much the money flow implied by these purchases affects exchange rates. (Plus probably two dozen other factors that I haven't thought of.) A thought: Presumably the effect on exchange rates of "exporting" a dollar's worth of government bonds is similar to the effect of exporting an extra dollar's worth of tangible goods in the balance of payments. So if one knows the effect of balance of payments on exchange rates, and can estimate the the % of bonds "exported", one would have my answer. So, to get me halfway there, what is the best way to estimate the effect of balance of payments on exchange rates (for the US economy)? (I should state that, overall, I'm just looking for an order-of-magnitude answer, not anything precise.)
