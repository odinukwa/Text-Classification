+1 to the Ballistic pendulum idea. Here is a method requiring less mathematical insight, and is more of a brute force method. We actually use a variant of this method in many tests of speed on computers today. The idea is to measure a large number of events, back to back. Say I am firing arrows; I can line up 20 archers with the instruction that when I say "GO", the first archer fires an arrow; the next has drawn his bow but does not fire until he sees the first arrow land, the third waits for the second arrow to land, and so on. The entire operation of all 20 arrows being fired and landed is timed, by however they may time such things. I'd suggest ticks of something like a metronome or weight-driven clock, or the amount of time it takes a ball to roll down a spiral chute (move it to the top the moment it rolls into your hand at the bottom), or any other standard that measures a consistent amount of time; within 1% or so. Say it is measured in 'tocks'. Next: Measure the distance of all arrows fired; and add them up. That can be done with any standard measuring stick. Divide that distance by the total tocks, and you have the average distance traveled per tock for the arrow. The error is minor; expert archers (or slingers) will release their missiles within about 1/10th of a second after seeing the previous hit the ground. The timing is likewise going to be very consistent; even with the spiral chute, the time it takes a practiced ball catcher to move the ball will be so consistent it just becomes part of the timing and varies by less than 1/20th of a second. This approach probably does not work for gunpowder weapons; but for things in the Roman era, trebuchets, slings, arrows, spears, etc that are too fast to count time accurately, but slow enough to watch, this aggregate measurement approach will work. 

The antlers can be a signal of health, a strong immune system, etc, just like a peacock's tail. The peacock's tail is actually a drag on survivability (literally), it makes it more difficult for the peacock to escape predators (and this is observed in the wild). The same has been shown for bright colors in other male birds; it reduces camouflage compared to the female's drabber brown to black feathering: The latter evolved because color in a female is unnecessary (or vice versa). For a peacock, we know females are attracted to larger tails and symmetric tails, and avoid males with missing feathers or lop-sided development; which may be a sign of disease or other fitness failures in escaping predators, which would reduce the likelihood of chick survival. (The females don't know that, of course, they are just genetically predisposed to attraction to large, symmetric, colorful tails). For antlers, demand the same thing: large, symmetric, unbroken, and uniform in color and visible texture. No patchiness, no thinness. The male has to be healthy with plenty of calories to spare to carry such a rack. It does not have to be that they FIGHT with it; just like peacock's do not fight with their tails. Even if they are an intelligent species like humans, it won't matter: Human men and women both are still very much predisposed to the physical characteristics of healthy individuals: Models are almost always very close to perfectly symmetrical in face and body; women are attracted to tall men with deeper voices, men are attracted to young fit women. Everybody prefers smooth skin that has no hint of disease. Your antler species will be the same, no matter how "intelligent" they may be, attraction is at a much more instinctive animal level in the brain than rational thought is likely to be. 

From the realist POV the "person" is only the organization of neurons and their functions; none of the rest of the body really matters; and nearly every part have been severed by amputation or replaced by machinery or transplant without any alteration of "the person". (Other than normal personality changes due to persistently changed circumstances). Stephen Hawking has been a brain almost entirely disconnected from his body for most of his life; but is still a functioning human being. We transplant hearts, livers, kidneys, lungs, hands and more; even losing your heart doesn't change your memories, loves, politics or other inclinations. We are just meat machines: Sometimes hateful, mean and cruel, but most of us are loving, caring, crying, romantic, joyful meat machines. This is excellent news for any meat machine that desires immortality. Because our 100 billion neurons and their trillion connections are just biological entities rather like plants with intertwined roots. There is no magical component impossible to replicated. Not only that, but the replication does not have to be perfect in order to preserve personality. Being of retirement age myself, I have seen Alzheimer's up close a few times among my parents and other older kin. Although it eventually does take the "person", a large amount of function can be lost while seemingly retaining the full "personality" characteristics of "who they are". My aunt had an unreasonably ridiculous love of dogs; and for years, even when she couldn't remember her own kids, they could get a reliably happy and joyful response from her simply by showing up to visit her with their combined pack of dogs. Of course we do see radical personality changes when the brain is severely injured, by bullets or blunt trauma, cancer, other disease or surgery. But the Alzheimer's patients are still good news for realists: It means the intertwining of neurons must have a very high redundancy, making the personality resilient to rather extensive damage. Of course we'd expect that to evolve; but in practical terms, it means replication can have a reasonable margin of error, in excess of 1%, and still reproduce the "person". Presumably, some future technology (centuries away) really could freeze the brain, preserving the neurons and synapses. Then, in a destructive fashion, pick the brain apart and map every necessary component of it: Neurons, axons, synapses, glia, and anything else we have (by then) discovered is necessary. The point is NOT to simulate this inside a computer, just to record the organization and network that is (in a realist POV) the personality, memories and emotions of Aunt Ariel at 50 years of age. That information can be used grow a copy of her brain, minus any disease, with brand new "equipment". Something like with a 3-D printer, but over months, guiding the growth of the individual cells into the order specified by the "original" brain. Both recording and reproduction can have some small margin of error. Also presumably in these centuries the biological control of cells needed to reconnect this brain to a new (brainless) body will all have been solved; and Aunt Ariel will awaken reborn. From a realist POV that really will be Aunt Ariel; because all that counts and makes her, "HER", is that incredibly complex pattern of connections in her brain; which has plenty of redundancy and resilience to any damage caused by reproduction. So think of it as Aunt Ariel after being knocked unconscious in a minor car accident that caused no other injuries, and cured all her brain and body diseases in the bargain, and gave her a healthy 24 year old body. Barring the collapse of civilization and technology; this could continue indefinitely, and would be effective immortality. Perhaps with enough technology, the recording of every molecule and connection in the brain could be both non-invasive and diagnostic: so one could have an archive of themselves every day, like taking a shower, and computers could identify the presence of any disease or cancer the day it starts. I would note we do not have to understand the brain in order to accurately reproduce it, just like a camera does not need to understand any meaning of the images it captures. Just like if I could replicate all the parts of a Swiss watch, in both material and form to the microscopic level, I could reassemble a copy of the watch that works like the original (otherwise I did not replicate all the parts correctly). There is no "soul" in the Swiss watch that makes it work; it does what it does as a consequence of mundane physics. The same holds for a computer. From the realist POV the same holds for animals and people; in principle they are a pattern of atoms and molecules that can be known and replicated. 

Given ONLY the two choices the OP provided; the better option is legislated equality. The "ascension" option, after the death or retirement of the enlightened Monarch, is far more likely to lead to the immediate assassination of the female successor, or her forced marriage to a Male that then becomes King. In a world of female subjugation, the vast majority of men (the only ones with a vote) blinks twice: They don't think the Monarch was enlightened, they think his wits were addled and he should have worked harder to find a good successor that would care for the females in his charge: They don't admire him, they think him a traitor that left a power vacuum into which violence was bound to rush, and the consequence was fatal and bloody to his own family, and instability followed by a coup in the government. The addled Monarch will be vilified, not praised, and unsuccessful. Personally I am for 100% equality; but putting myself in the shoes of these fictional characters, their reactions are not pretty and a female monarch is unlikely. An alternative to violence would be overriding the Monarch and appointing a male Regent (like a child would) that would actually run the country, an "acting" Monarch, until some male was born in the Monarch's bloodline. Then the infant King would be appointed a Regent to run his affairs. In the end, such arrangements can result in a complete loss of power to the Monarch; the Regents and some committee (like Parliament) use the opportunity to parcel out the power of the Monarch which is no longer protected with force by loyalists to the Monarch. Remember the psyche of all societies that subjugate women; both boys and girls are trained from birth to believe women are not warriors, and not thinkers, and not brave, too weak and slight to be able to defend themselves, that women are addled and physically disabled by menstruation and pregnancy. The female Monarch may be physically protected by a guard of men willing to sacrifice their lives to protect her, but they are not going to protect her political power because they are warriors, and do not believe she is capable of making intelligent decisions, or commanding an army, or even dealing with foreign powers from a position of strength. Her guard may succeed in preserving her life, but they won't obey her commands any more than they'd obey a five year old: If she has a loyal guard, they will bargain for her life (and income and their own jobs) by endorsing a Regent, Husband (in waiting if she is very young), or new King of their choosing. Because of her own culturally instilled beliefs, she will likely agree to such arrangements immediately upon realizing she faces drawn swords if she doesn't, and while the people may be happy to keep her in a jeweled carriage as the Monarch's Queen or Princess, on his strong arm at Parades and Parties, they won't back her as Monarch. The Monarch's female ascension plan is stillborn. That said; earlier comments and the accepted answer cover the specific forms of legislation I would also consider priorities; I will vote for some of those. 

Mice may already be "sentient", meaning self-aware and reasonably intelligent. They show Empathy. Here is more info on the sentience of mice; it is from PETA, but what they are showing is all proven in a scientific lab setting. Rats are altruistic, and will help a friend even if it means foregoing a treat. From that link, an excerpt is below. I'd say mice/rats are already sentient, self-aware, able to imagine a future and act to bring it to pass. What they lack is not sentience but advanced intelligence, the (apparently only human) ability to think in abstractions of abstractions that allow us our science, long term planning, mathematics, etc. To answer your question: MANY animals are already sentient; and this does not depend upon their brain size at all. Our recursive abstractive intelligence, however, has apparently evolved only once in the approximately one billion years of life on Earth. I imagine any sentient creature (dogs, porpoises, mice, elephants, apes) has the potential to develop recursive abstractive intelligence, but it might be also be a once-in-ten-billion-years event. 

Speaking as a college professor that works in artificial intelligence, this is basically all impossible. Sentience would require some way for plants to both sense and "model" the world around them using abstractions. To the best of our current knowledge, that requires neurons, in large quantities, in order to think. We call those brains. It is likely that something as small as a mouse has some sentience (self-awareness), several experiments indicate they do. But for long-term planning of strategies like you speak of, the human brain is the only one we are aware of that is capable of that. I think your plants would need brains at least the size of a young human. Now those neurons could be distributed through much of the plant, perhaps. But even then, it appears much of our own intellect was evolved in response to our ability to manipulate objects and things. Plants do not have muscles either. By the time you give plants all the attributes they need to evolve sentience, they are no longer plants but animals! So I would say no, it is not possible for plants to be accidentally mutated into any form that can have sentience to the scale that allows them to plan for the future.
