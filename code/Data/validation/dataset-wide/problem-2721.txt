The conclusion is that these four premises lead to a logical contradiction. If one agrees with that, one would have to reject some of the premises. Perhaps an omniscient, omnipotent and omnibenevolent God does not exist? This removes God, but it keeps evil. One might also claim there is no evil and keep God. Plantinga’s free will defense defuses this argument. He shows how one can keep all four premises by showing that they do not result in a contradiction given the existence of agents with free will. A naturalist, as described in Plantinga’s EAAN, should not accept any of the four premises as true. In particular the naturalist should not accept the fourth premise about the existence of evil any more than the first three premises about the existence of God. Evil requires an agent to cause the evil, but naturalists, as Plantinga describes them, do not admit anything “God-like”: They do not admit the existence of any agents that might bring about evil. Evil might be watered down to “natural evil” so that evil is reduced to some event causation that some might not be happy about but conceivably others might. Regardless how one feels, since that is nothing more than determined neural brain processes, there is nothing one can do about it since this “one” who wants to do something about it is not an agent. This naturalism would be challenged if one could show the existence of an agent, that is, if it could be shown that at least one of the four premises of the problem of evil argument are true. That agent might be God perhaps like the one described in the first three premises. That agent may also be the one causing any evil that might exist in the world. It is easy to dismiss God who can be viewed as transcending empirical evidence, but perhaps it is not so easy to dismiss evil that some find more evident. One would have to convert anything evil into an event causation that neutralizes it and claim that those who see evil in the world are deluded just as they are deluded about their free will. The existence of injustice or evil is more specifically a challenge to views such as naturalism, which as Plantinga describes it is an extreme form of atheism, that do not admit the existence of any agent to cause injustice. 

By this view, time existed prior to the universe and could extend indefinitely into the past. Craig also references Gerald James Whitrow’s What is Time? and The Natural Philosophy of Time who argued for a relational view of time with time beginning with the first event. Craig handled both cases: On a Newtonian view of time, an agent chooses “from eternity” to create the universe at a specific time. On a relational view of time an agent makes the choice “timelessly” and time begins with the universe. From the above I conclude that in the context of the kalam cosmological argument it is the universe that began to exist and therefore needs a cause, not necessarily time. Time might have started then or not. If it did not start with the universe there could have been an infinite number of moments prior to now in “an empty time”. 

Given open theism, there is no paradox. Regarding the question, Since either option leads to contradiction, doesn't this prove that free will and omnscience are incompatible?, open theists would agree that there is a contradiction between free will and a definition of omniscience that assumes the omniscient being knows more than they claim there is to know. 

As reference see Alvin Plantinga’s Where the Conflict Really Lies: Science, Religion, & Naturalism. The “Evolutionary Argument Against Naturalism” is contained in Part IV Deep Conflict, pages 307-350. As preliminary let’s assume naturalism includes a belief in materialism with respect to human beings. Plantinga uses this materialism to describe belief as a neural structure. These neural structures have two properties. There is the neurophysiological property and the content of the belief property. Adaptations operate on the neurophysiological property, not the content property. Content makes a belief true or false. See pages 318-25. There are five questions. In my class, we talked about the idea of an undefeatable defeator. Is this the same as self-defeating? The specific defeator that Plantinga constructs is the claim that given naturalism and evolution our cognitive faculties are unreliable. If one cannot trust one’s cognitive faculties nothing they produce is reliable. Suppose one uses one’s cognitive faculties to find a defeator for this defeator then even that defeator is unreliable and can’t be trusted. This specific defeator that one’s cognitive faculties are unreliable given naturalism and evolution is therefore undefeatable. Not all defeators have this property of being undefeatable, but because this one is about the reliability of our cognitive faculties themselves it is a defeator that gives itself no out. It is not that it is self-defeating, but that it is a defeator for all belief statements including itself. Furthermore, if this defeator were used against itself as a self-defeator it would not change anything. One already knows one’s cognitive faculties are unreliable given naturalism and evolution. There is no point in applying the defeator twice. See pages 345-6. The naturalistic evolutionary theory believes in a blind and unguided natural processes. How is it different from the evolutionary theory (standard one)? Plantinga has no problem with the various evolutionary theories as long as they allow evolution to be guided. He claims he can separate an evolutionary theory into the scientific part that does not require blind and unguided processes from the metaphysics of naturalism which contains the blind and unguided processes. He has no problem with the scientific part of these theories. His problem is only with the metaphysical add-ons to these evolutionary theories that claim they are blind and unguided. Combine the scientific evolutionary theory with the metaphysics of naturalism and you have “naturalistic evolutionary theory”. It doesn’t matter whether the evolutionary theory is standard or not. See pages 307-9. When Plantiga presents possible cases for Darwin's doubt (fact that the conditional probability of cognitive reliability P(R|N&E) is low), he uses as one of the possibilities the case where beliefs are maladaptive. He claims that because of this, P(R|N&E) is too low. But, if beliefs are maladaptive, isn't it rational to argue that most of them would have disappeared through evolutionary processes, and thus what remains makes for a larger share of reliable cognitive faculties, thus a higher P(R|N&E)? Plantinga addressed this objection on pages 335-9. Given naturalism and evolution, what is adaptive is the neurophysiological processes, not the content of the beliefs. It does not matter if the beliefs are true or not for adaptation to be successful. What does P(N&E) mean in terms of philosophical words? Is it simply the probability that a person picked at random believes in naturalistic evolution theory? Let N be naturalism. Let E be an evolutionary theory. P(N&E) is the probability someone might assign to the belief that both naturalism and that evolutionary theory are both true. There is no need to estimate how many people in a population believe N&E. For Plantinga, P(N&E) = 0 since he does not support naturalism. For someone supporting naturalism, P(N&E) = 1. Plantinga is showing that for those who find N&E believable, he can construct a defeator, "P(R|N&E) is low", to go against the belief in the reliability of our cognitive faculties. [Most important question] Could someone please explain Plantinga's argument when he presents Bayes's theorem and proceeds with some math? I understand conditional probabilities, so it's not the math I don't get, but rather his assumptions and development through the argument. For example, he says to give P(R) a high probability of 1, which means we highly believe that our cognitive faculties produce reliable beliefs. But then, he says to give P(R|N&E) no more than 1/2. This would be true for someone who does not believe in our cognitive reliability, whereas we just assigned P(R)~1. I'm greatly confused on this part of the development. Let R be the belief that our cognitive faculties are reliable. Initially the probability that we have reliable beliefs, P(R), is, say, greater than 2/3. However, if someone accepts N&E, then there is a defeator for R. It is "Darwin’s doubt" made more precise by using conditional probability. The defeator is “P(R|N&E) is low”. This is not just a defeator for R. It is a defeator for every belief because our cognitive faculties that generate beliefs is believed to be unreliable. This forces us (as it did Darwin) to lower the probability of R.
