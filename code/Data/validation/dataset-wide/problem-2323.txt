You will get scared, that's fine don't fight it just accept it. "Ok I'm scared, now what". This helps you think though the panic. 

You can see a list of the mebership discounts currently at: $URL$ It covers a wide variety of things. TBH, if your looking to join the BMC for a discount it's likely not worth it. Often I get better discounts from memberships to walls, etc. 

The valley sides and the warm air trap the cold in the valley bottom. Where the warm and cold air touch water is condensed from the warm air to form clouds (). The warm air acts as a "cap" preventing the cold from escaping (Capping inversion) 

So basically do whatever you can to reach the person without entering the water yourself. Many dangerous areas have life rings, etc. These should be your first port of call. If you can't safely get to the person, don't try! This is pretty hard I'd imagine but the correct thing to do. 

What are the identifying features that allow you to tell the difference between these 3 common UK summer visitors? I've been looking at the RSBP advice but it seems that a swift and a house martin are very similar if you only have a fleeting glimpse. 

Another option is a climbing club. Climbing clubs will be full of knowledgeable people who can teach you lots (not just safety). You're also going to have a better idea they know what they are doing. Just because someone says something forcefully does not make it correct. I've been told all sorts of odd things over the years, some of which are correct but a scary amount were plain wrong. 

Again, not the end of the world. If the chalk (not the bag) gets really wet it's going to become unusable though. It will turn into a weird gooey chalky mass. But chalks relatively cheap, you can always replace it. Also fine to wash your chalk bag. Again, just dry it well before use. 

The tide builds up pressure behind a sand bank, eventually this bank breaks and the build up of water empties into deeper water, taking everything and everyone with it. To exit a rip tide you swim side ways to the beach, not against it. You won't win against the current. 

A base layer is one part of a layering system. A base layers job (and merino does an excellent job of this FYI) is: 

Generally the trick to undercuts is to stand tall, therefore keeping your arms as straight as possible. This allows you to rest your biceps as much as you can and make's it easier to hold yourself against the wall. If the holds are above you then hang out away from the wall as much as you can, again you want to keep your arms as straight as possible. Undercut's are all about the biceps. So work on this muscle to improve your undercut(ability) 

Drain all the water out of the tube Remove the tube from the bladder and the bite valve and hang it up Bend a metal coat hanger in half (make sure no sharp edges are exposed) push the coat hanger into the bladder and hang the coat hanger up 

press with your other hand on one finger upwards, you can't press very hard without it moving. Now compress your fingers as though they are in tight fitting shoes: bend your fingers and press them together tightly: 

now press on one finger, the weight is distributed though the other fingers and you can press a LOT harder. Same principal with your feet. The sum is greater than it's individual parts. 

This is there you want to cut towards. You start at the head. Locate the point where the gill slits join or failing that simply the flesh under the jaw bone: 

There is a chance that in the wrong context this could be classed as an offensive weapon (If your in an inner london housing estate hanging out with a gang with this concealed in a bag then the police may well think that your up to no good). If your in a rural area on your way to the woods carrying a saw then no police constable in his right mind would class this as an offensive weapon and even if they did I would like to see them make that stand up in court. 

Yes! There are several resons why it's important who manages the land. For a start they control how the land is managed. Should it be farmed, should it be left to nature, should x area be allowed to flood or should we repair the dykes, etc., etc. This has a massive say on what the land looks like and who wants to use it for what. Access can be contentious issue. Who is allowed to do what and when. The people managing the land will likely have the biggest say in this. For example the issues around climbers having access to Yosemite has become a big issue in which the climbers are in often direct opposition to the park authority. These authorities will also maintain areas of the park. They are typically responsible for making sure footpaths are accessible, camp sites, clean, etc. Different agencies are likely to have differing views on what is important in a particular area. They are also likely to be effected to various pressure groups (such as the BMC as a UK example) and have differing budgets for the areas. How these agencies address these issues is bound to vary between agencies, if not members in said agencies. So it's vitally important that the correct people (from you point of view) are in charge of the correct areas. Bear in mind that these "wildernesses" are actually managed areas. Historically many of the parks were created to "preserve the wilderness of the american west". This actually involved kicking out all of the native american people who had lived and managed the areas for generations. The new parks, effectively changed the wilderness they were attempting to preserve. The environment is constantly evolving and this is constantly being managed by some agency or other. So they have a great deal of input into the park's look, feel and environment. 

This is due to the load that is passed to each anchor. You might think that (for example) two anchors will receive 50% load each during a fall or simply when the climber weights the rope. But actually the amount of load an anchor receives depends on the angle of the rope that this is attached to. Typically a belay with two anchor points forms a triangle 

Reading the description for a clove hitch on animated knots by Grog (the go to bible of knots IMO) I was surprised to read: 

Because each layer breaths you don't get wet. The moisture is taken off you skin ASAP and is then slowly released though your layers. It's important to have at least one or two breathable layers next to your skin (if not breathable all the way though) as keeping moisture off your skin will prevent you from getting cold. 

You want to insert the tip of your knife into this flesh (at the head end) about 0.5cm. Hold the fish firmly with other hand. Slide the knife all the way down the underside of the fish opening up the underneath of the fish until you reach the anus (which you located earlier). The sharper the knife the easier this will be. Be careful not to cut your hand you only need to insert the tip of the knife so don't go slashing all the way though the fish! You should now have a cavity the whole length of the underside of the fish. Insert your index finger into the cavity at the head end, and basically try and hook the innards out. No use being gently here you hant to get a hold of the guts and give them a good pull. Remove anything that isn't flesh. Any blood should be rinsed out (in a river or under a running tap). You want the cavity to be clean and bloodless. Any guts, swim bladders, etc. should be discarded (throw these into the river, lake or sea where they will be eaten by other animals). For flat fish the process is the same but the cavity is located in a different place (typically) the side of the fish not the underside. The above should be applicible to most "standard shaped" fish. 

Got me thinking. When setting up this slackline I used a dyneema at one end to extend the rope slightly. I actually picked dyneema purposly as I didn't want it to stretch. It was under tension (from the slack line and people using the slack line) for a number of hours. I noticed afterwards that the sling had become slightly "stiff". Should I now retire this sling? Is it ok to expose dyneema to this type of load or does it act like the aluminium crab mentioned in the comment? Would a Nylon one of held out any better? Just to clarify, my question is, having used this sling for a slackline anchor and having had it under load, is it now OK to use while climbing? 

A long time ago (when I was teenager) I had one of the early GoreTex jackets. I had this Jacket for years and years and used it constantly. Over time the fabric wore out and it started to leak. This actually got to the point where you could see though it in places (imagine a thin cotton t-shirt, that kind of thiness). 

If it doesn't fit well I'd say the first of these questions is lacking. Still working to a degree but because the fit isn't ideal there are likely areas of your body where the sweat could be wicked away faster. Base layers are tight to ensure they remain in contact with your skin at all times. The second is likely unaffected by the size issue. Why you need this wicking When exercising you tend to sweat but you don't really want this sweat to condense on your skin (especially when you stop moving, etc) as it will cool you too fast. In a typical layering system a base layers job is to move this sweat away form your skin as fast as possible, to prevent it condensing on your skin. Thus keeping you warm and comfortable. It's important that the other layers in your system are breathable to allow the wicked sweat to escape from your layering. 

What is the technique involved in crevasse rescues? Presuming a group are all moving together on a glacier and the leader of the party has fallen into a crevasse (collapsed snow bridge, etc.). The fall was held so all other members of the party are secure. How do the other members of the team go about retrieving their colleague? What are the main techniques etc. that need to be learned to perform this activity? 

The third picture are floats. This is for a different type of fishing altogether. I.e. baited line fishing. The float is designed to sit in the water with a hook attached underneath with some bait on it. Best in calm water. Visibility less of an issue, the fish are attracted to the bait by smell mostly. I'm not familiar with the Gulp worms. They appears to be some kind of artificial bait. You will likely want to use these with the floats, etc. The above target fish that scavenge mostly rather than hunt actively. Though a degree of cross over is expected. i.e. trout 

There's no one boot for all occasions. Different footwear has different advantages and is disadvantages and I don't feel it's correct to criticise x type of boot/shoe. It depends on the circumstances. 

My surfing/windsurfing knowledge is limited. But yes they can be dangerous and yes you should seek knowledge on currents before surfing anywhere. There are currents that can force you against rocks, or into sea caves or under water of the dreaded rip tides. Rip tides are nasty and can suck you out to sea. My mate was caught in one of these once and in a matter of seconds he was in seriously deep water. Here's an animation of how rip tides work: 

No, I don't see why it would be? Providing you wear the protector under your pack... :) Providing the back protector is fitted correctly (typically under you coat, etc.) putting a pack on top isn't going to make any difference. 

Piles of clothes (though not that comfortable) they do help insulate you when it's cold (one of the main things a sleeping mat does is insulate you from the ground to keep you warm, not just make it more comfortable). 

Try and wait it out. Don't simply let go and don't down climb. Wait, close your eyes, concentrate on your breathing, wait for the adrenaline to die down to an acceptable level, then continue. Try and hold on at this point (as opposed to letting your belayer "take"), realise you can probably hold at this point longer than you realise. Rationalise the situation. 

source If you look at the cumulonimbus cloud (a common "rain type" cloud) the temperature gradient from the top and the bottom (50,000 feet in total!) can be very large indeed as is the m3 of moisture. If we take our cumulonimbus and assume it is 50,000 feet (15240 m) high. Let's assume the average temperature of this cloud is (picks a number at random) 33f(1c) that means every m3 holds a bout 0.3lbs of water. So a 1x m block 15240m high can hold about 4,572lbs of water. You then need to times this by the area (m2) of the cloud (if you can figure this out...). Obviously we make a lot of assumptions here and it will not be a static amount (pretty much ever). Also bear in mind that not all this moisture will turn to rain. So tl;dr a lot and it's complicated. 

We've had limited success, a couple of wood pigeons and a black bird that visits occasionally and roots thought the lawn. the area is full of swallows, starlings, tits, etc. none of them seem to want to enter our new estate. Does anyone have any better ideas (reversible ones that I can either remove or take with em when I leave) of what I can do to encourage birds into my garden? My garden 

So that appears to be made of "Dry Flight 10K" whatever that is... o_O I can't find any washing instructions for this...whatever it is Reading between the lines a little I'm guessing it's breathable in which case I'd follow the below instructions: 

It sounds counter intuitive but leave everything inside the car open, i.e. the boot cover glove box, etc. Make it obvious that there is nothing worth stealing inside (and obviously don't leave anything worth stealing). Don't worry about them stealing your car, this is practically impossible with modern security devices (the only way to steal a car these days is by stealing the key due to immobilisers, etc). Still doesn't protect you from random acts of senseless vandalism but, well nothing can do this really. 

Any thought about when this rope should be retired? I'm thinking about semi retiring it now as it's 60m long and quite heavy. I rarely use half of this amount and my back would appreciate a lighter shorter rope! 

The load placed on each anchor also increases. At 90 degrees the load is 71%. At 120 Degrees it's 100%!! So you should always keep the angle between anchors under 60 degrees. 

What re the best quality walking, trekking maps for Spain? In the UK were pretty lucky as we have the Ordance Survey (a government body that maintains all topo maps). Is there an equivalent in Spain? I've heard you can buy the old military maps, but: 

I knew though that these skills likely weren't enough for what I wanted to do. So my next step has been to get some winter training (the Alps are obviously covered in snow and ice so this is very important). I actually looked into doing a winter skills course in Scotland but found these prohibitively expensive. So I decided to teach myself (this isn't for everyone, I'm a bit of a nerd on these types of subjects and I like to think I'm aware of my own limitiaions). so I bought the following items: 

A lot of the other answers talk about Fire ecologies. These are common in areas like Australia and California where the wildlife have evolved to deal with regular (moderate) wildfires. In these areas wood is cleared out periodically by the fires. So the pyramid has evolved without the large amounts of dead wood that are common in more temperate forests. I'm not going to repeat these points but tl;dr: Ultimately in respects to harm to an ecosystem, the wild ecosystem should be maintained in as wild a form as possible. If this involves large amounts of dead wood then leave it. If this wood is cleared (naturally) clear it.
