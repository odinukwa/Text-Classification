As an initial note, I have not seen any plausible claims that a crypto crash would cause liquidity problems for the financial system. As a reult, I would need to guess to the mechanism. I do not think “liquidity” is what anyone should worry about right now. For a firm we need to distinguish between illiquid and insolvent. 

This is a pretty big question, and there are a lot of debates about it. I will attempt to give a partial answer. The first issue: how are exchange rates determined? There’s a lot of theories in economics, but from the standpoint of a financial market practitioner, it’s not clear how useful they are. If we have a freely-floating currency (no peg to something else), all we know for sure is that the volume of sellers has to equal buyers. The key point is that international transactions are generally not to buy coffee in a local cafe, rather to trade goods and services, or buy financial assets. The price of a currency is driven by the relative attractiveness of a country’s exports and its financial assets. Take Canada/US. Huge cross-border trade, similar economic structures and standard of living, and some people even go across the border to shop. Even so, the exchange rate can be relatively volatile, sometimes moving by 50% over a few years. The standard of living in common currency terms changes a lot, which tells us that currencies do not act in a way to balance out standards of living. Currency pegs are put in place by a central bank buying or selling its currency to hold the exchange rate constant. It has to cancel out imblances in transaction flows. It has no problem selling its currency, but buying is a problem. It needs gold or foreign currency to buy its currency; when it runs out, the peg breaks. (This is a high level summary of how the Gold Standard failed.) The way to stop this is have a common currency (like the euro). The issue is that currencies are not lumps of gold, they are liabilities of some issuer. In Canada, Canadian dollars are a liability of a branch of the Canadian Federal Government, similarly for the United States. If you issue the currency, you control its supply, and interest rate. If you use the money issued by another entity, you lose control of your money supply and interest rates. Most developed countries want to keep that control. The euro area countries granted that comtrol to the European Central Bank. One result of that loss of control was that Greece was driven into a depression, and could do nothing about it. 

thus he would choose lottery $D'$. This is one example of how uncertainty can be treated in a problem like this, but by no means is the only. Note: Earlier I thought had a piece of my answer that talked about priors over the value of $B$, but this wasn't carefully thought through. You can have multiple values that you might imagine $B$ takes, but as soon as you assign a probability distribution to any of these values then you have left the realm of uncertainty and moved to the realm of risk. 

Unfortunately (or fortunately depending on how you look at it), we don't know what $x$ and $y$ look like in this equation. Instead we are given $(x' x)$, $(x' y)$, and $(y' y)$. Using your comment about what RSS actually is -- Namely, that $$\text{RSS} = (y_{\text{observed}} - y_{\text{estimated}})' (y_{\text{observed}} - y_{\text{estimated}})$$ First notice that $y_{\text{estimated}}$ is simply $x \beta$. Then replacing this in the previous formula gives us \begin{align*} \text{RSS} &= (y_{\text{observed}} - y_{\text{estimated}})' (y_{\text{observed}} - y_{\text{estimated}}) \\ &= (y_{\text{observed}} - x \beta)' (y_{\text{observed}} - x \beta) \\ &= y'y - 2y'x\beta + x \beta \beta' x' \end{align*} Now this is almost what we want. We want things to ultimately be in terms of $(y'y)$, $(x'x)$, $(x' y)$, and $\beta$. The first term is exactly $y'y$, but other terms look like they have pieces we want and we just have to find a way to get them. Now, notice that each of the elements in our equation above is simply a scalar (aka sizes are such that they are $1 \times 1$). The determinant of a scalar is itself, then by using properties of determinants we can say: \begin{align*} 2y'x \beta &= \det(2y'x\beta) = \det(2 \beta' x' y) \\ x \beta \beta' x' &= \det(x \beta \beta' x') = \det(\beta' x' x \beta) \end{align*} I will leave the linear algebra itself as an exercise. 

That is, it just reshuffles the right hand side of the central bank's balance sheet; the asset side is unchanged. (On the income statement, there is a correpsonding $1 interest expense.) All the central bank needs to do is ensure that the aggregate interest paid on reserves is less than the aggregate interest received from its lending and bond/bill holdings to prevent equity from going negative. Since 100% of a central bank's assets pay interest, and its currency (dollar bills) do not, keeping the net interest flow positive is not too difficult (in a positive interest rate environment). You asked what backs the currency. The answer is the taxing power of government. There's a few theoretical justifications for that statement, One is provided by Fiscal Theory of the Price Level (edge of mainstream), and another is referred to as "neo-Chartalism" (post-Keynesian). As for the relationship between inflation and the rate of interest, the answer depends upon which school of economics you follow. Increasing interest rates increases the interest income of the private sector (which should increase effective demand, as you note), which is traded off by the effect on behaviour of the higher rate of interest. The conventional answer is that the behavioural effects dominate; that is, higher interest rates slow the economy and inflation. 

This is the reverse of the accounting procedure discussed in my answer to this question: link to question What you want is the average cost basis for all holders of company. There is no practical way that this could be calculated for a public firm. Nobody is required to report that information, and not everyone uses that accounting method for equities for taxes. It would also be highly biased against firms where the founders hold a significant portion of shares. In an IPO, only a portion of the total number of shares are sold, sometimes only 10% of the firm. (Your example implies that 100% of the shares are sold in the IPO, which is misleading.) it is entirely possible for a founder of a company to retain control of a large percentage of the shares for decades. This method would assign almost no value to that portion of the company, which makes the valuation given meaningless for analysis. 

Recursive Macroeconomic Theory isn't a "numerical analysis" book per se, but it has an excellent exposition of the shooting algorithm in a growth model in Chapter 11 of the second edition (I don't think the chapter numbers changed much, but chapter is called "Fiscal Policies in the Nonstochastic Growth Model"). I would recommend starting there. References Ljungqvist, Lars and Sargent, Thomas J. "Recursive Macroeconomic Theory." MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass., 2000. 

In addition to the solutions that FooBar presented in his answer, one of the ways that people are able to get rid of multiple equilibria is incomplete information. I can't find the papers that are most relevant to your example at the moment, but the "canonical" example that I think of is Morris Shin 1998. Essentially what happens is the following: Their model is a model of a "currency attack." There is a state of the world that determines whether a currency attack is worthwhile or not and to successfully attack a currency a certain number of investors (which depends on the state) must participate in the attack. Under complete information multiple equilibria can be supported, but with even a very small amount of noise in their signal about the underlying state of the world the equilibrium becomes unique. One relevant paper could be "Coordinating Business Cycles." I don't remember most of the details in this paper, but it essentially has the same type of result in a more fully developed model.

The answer to this question is complicated because the way the Fed operates has changed over time. In particular, Quantitative Easing (QE) changed things a lot. Firstly, the Fed largely controls the Fed Funds rate, which is an overnight inter-bank rate. Other interest rates are set as a spread to that rate, but are not directly controlled by the Fed. Instead, those rates are generally set by what market participants expect the Fed to do. Secondly, we need to be careful about what “money supply” you are talking about. The Fed directly operates on the monetary base, since that roughly corresponds to the size of its balance sheet. Other monetary aggregates include other instruments that the Fed cannot directly control. In the pre-QE era, the Fed could control interest rates by creating/destroying bank reserves - a major component of the monetary base. Banks lend reserves to eachother in the Fed Funds market. If there is a shortage of reserves, banks will bid up the cost of reserves - the Fed Funds rate. The Fed creates reserves by buying bonds (or lending against them),and withdraws reserves by selling them. They need to conduct operations to keep interest rates near target. However, the Fed is effectively forced to supply whatever reserves are needed by the banking system, otherwise they will fail their reserves requirements. Central bankers started listening to Monetarists in the 1970s, and tried setting their interest rate target so that money growth would hit a target rate. However, since they did not publicly acknowledge that they had a target interest rate, it appeared that they were targeting the money supply. In the post-QE era, there is an excess of reserves in the system, so there is no issue of banks being short. Interest rates are instead determined by the level of interest paid on reserves, which can evolve completely independently of monetary aggregates. 

This is similar to what has already been said and it depends on what you classify as an asset. Money, although intrinsically worthless, maintains some worth which allows you to purchase in the future. There are three papers that I found really interesting on the subject (and I don't remember them being overly technical). They are three Kiyotaki Wright papers (1989, 1991, 1993). These papers basically set up a very simple economy (the one I'm thinking of has n goods and n agents). They then show what trade would look like in these economies without money and then what it would look like with the money. And one of the papers gets people basically establishing money (by saving a certain type of good which everyone accepts in trade). The others show that if you insert money into the economy then you are better off. Also, worth looking into if this is interesting to you is Neil Wallace's idea of "essentiality of money." 

Short answer It doesn't seem like you've tried very hard to find estimation using Dynare (google results of "Dynare estimation"). Dynare is in fact capable of doing estimation and typically people use some sort of data to estimate the parameters that govern their model. Longer Answer What is a DSGE model? A DSGE model is a series of equations (and variables and parameters) that describe a "model" economy. Once you write everything down and take into consideration the optimizing decisions made by the agents, it is simply a system of stochastic difference (differential) equation that you can imagine writing in some form along the lines of: $$ E_t F(y_{t+1}, y_t, y_{t-1}, u_t) = 0$$ What does Dynare do? The majority of introductory examples only use Dynare to solve the model and run some simple simulations. In addition to being able to solve the model, Dynare is also capable of doing Bayesian estimation of the parameters that make up the model by feeding in data. Solves and simulates the Model Dynare takes this system of equations (and the given parameter values) and solves them using perturbation methods. One of the outputs of the solution is a law of motion for all of the variables in the economy -- i.e. one can write something along the lines of $$y_{t+1} = F(y_t, u_{t+1})$$ This law of motion allows you to generate model analogues of the data that you are interested in -- i.e. capital, labor, consumption etc... Estimates the model Once Dynare has a law of motion and has obtained simulated moments, it can compare the output of the model to data that you have provided. Dynare uses Bayesian estimation (though it is possible it does other types, but I'm not familiar with it) to estimate parameters which means that you need to provide it with a prior for each variable that you would like to estimate. It then uses a simple Metropolis Hastings algorithm to obtain estimates for the distribution over parameter values. References I would recommend you read both of the following references.
