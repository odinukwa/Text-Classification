November and December can be an interesting time to look for work for a variety of reasons. One reason that some give is that during the holiday season (holidays for many), people may be in a more 'giving' spirit. That is debatable, but anecdotal evidence may seem to lead some to believe that is true. A much more tangible and realistic reason to look for work in those months is due to budgets and headcount. If a department has a specific budget for any given year and still has money left in that budget towards the end of the year, they may be more inclined to make a hire in order to be sure they will get the same or more budget for the following year. This is the same for a specific headcount. If a manager is budgeted to have say 8 employees on a team, and there are only 6, that manager has an incentive to bring the team to full capacity in order to keep that headcount for the following year. 

Recruiter here. The recruiting agency will typically want to find out your desired rate (or range) first, and then present you with the largest margin possible (margin is the difference between your pay rate and what the agency charges the hiring company). The agency almost always has a minimum amount of margin they will accept as there are costs associated with this scenario, particularly if you are W-2. The company may have a ceiling on rate as well. You should make it clear that your rate is not fixed, in that if you have to drive further, pay for parking, etc you will want some adjustment. If you make that clear, the recruiter won't be able to come back and claim some sort of agreement had already been made. I would always be sure to leave some flexibility in your rate and if a job is presented to you that is outside your comfort zone, let the recruiter know right away that the rate is going up for that particular gig. Since this is contract-to-hire, there is a slight wrinkle that is potentially to your advantage or could be to your disadvantage. Some companies will pay recruiters a placement fee (reduced usually) when they convert you to a full time employee, while some companies will offer nothing on conversion. Most that I have seen offer some placement fee if they hire within n days of start. The reasoning behind this is that a company could agree on a contract-to-hire scenario, make you a full time offer on day 1, and avoid paying any recruiter fees at all. So typically there will be some placement fee paid to the recruiter if you are hired within a certain amount of days of the contract start date. The reason I mention this is that if there is no 'buyout' on conversion, the recruiter needs to make his/her money during your contract period, so he/she is going to certainly try hard to maximize the margin and may beat you up a bit more on your hourly rate. If there is a buyout, and the buyout is somewhat significant, the recruiter may be willing to pay you a higher rate to get you in the door, knowing that the buyout on conversion will make up for the lower margin they are collecting. I would suggest asking the recruiter if there is a buyout paid, and when that would happen. I'm very transparent with my candidates in discussing fees and arrangements regarding fees like this so the candidate is aware of any motivations that I might have, and can make educated decisions. 

Based on the fact that they have already made an offer to you which is unacceptable (I think this is a key element of your question), I see some value in listing very specific details about your current compensation. I know this opinion differs from some others here, but I've had quite a bit of success in negotiating with clients (I'm a recruiter) after an unacceptable offer is made by giving every detail of a candidate's compensation package and comparing it to what is being offered. Companies are often, in my experience, very responsive to this if you are a valuable asset to the new firm. If you lay out specific details it becomes a very simple 'apples to apples' comparison for the hiring company, and they then know they have to do better or match it in the very least. Generally speaking, the more specific you are the more likely they will be to have a target to aim for. If they can't match something like your vacation days due to a corporate policy, it is pretty easy math to put a dollar value on a vacation day. The same 'apples to apples' can be used for other items such as their contribution to benefits for 401k or other perks that differ from your current position. Where it gets a bit sticky is in a couple situations: 

Of course not. A better question might be 'Are all software development groups like this?', and the answer would still be no. 

As a 22 year old getting a 70% increase you should be excited here, but you should be equally excited (from a career development perspective) of your ability to now work with some other people. If you are a good developer, the money will come - the key is honing your craft and getting good at it, and finding dev shops that allow you to learn and grow. 

I think breaking this post down may be helpful. Being decisive in a job search is usually a function of being prepared and having your expectations properly set before starting the search. I usually advise candidates to try and have a very clear picture of what job they want, so when they find it they will know. 

Your new employer may be willing to provide some sort of sign-on bonus in order to get you to start at a new job quickly and to forgo a coming bonus. This is fairly common around times when bonuses are paid (end of year and early Feb/Mar). When discussing your compensation with a potential new employer, be sure to mention any bonuses that are expected in the relatively near future (< 6 months) 

The simple and obvious answer is to outperform your co-workers and volunteer to take on more challenging tasks with more responsibility. The new CEO is bringing in talent from his/her past because they are known entities and proven performers (or just friends, but we can't assume that). Tell your manager that you want to take on more responsibility. Think of a new project idea that would save the company money or create revenues, write up a proposal, and volunteer to lead the new effort. You need to think of creative solutions to problems that perhaps the company is not yet addressing or even aware of. Think about new initiatives, design how they can be implemented, and show how you can lead. If you have a great presentation that shows a new way to save or make money, you will get noticed. Good luck! 

It depends on how you define better opportunities. At your age, learning is the most important thing in your career development. As I said, the money will come to you if you get good at your job, so focus on that first and worry about making enough money to maintain a decent lifestyle and pay your bills. I can't see how being the sole web developer at a company, where you were quite obviously grossly underpaid and without a mentor at the impressionable age of 22, is a solid career choice. It may have been your only choice at the time, but it's not an ideal situation. You say you 'owe' your current company for giving you your first job? It sounds like they were the ones that owed you, as they clearly were underpaying you for at least a portion of your stint. Do you know how long it takes most people to get 70% increases? The fact that this new employer gave you an offer this high, and then your current employer almost matched immediately is a clear sign that you were underpaid. Being loyal to a company is a good thing overall, but being loyal to a company should never come at the expense of your own career and being loyal to yourself (and family that depends on your career success). I feel your loyalty to your current employer may be at your own expense. You don't need to listen to all the doom and gloom that most recruiter articles will tell you ('You will be the first one fired', 'Your loyalty is always in question now and you'll never get a promotion', etc.), as not all of that is always true. Lesson learned, classic counter offer situation that happens all the time. Judge opportunities on more than just dollars (unless you are in dire need of every dollar), and at 22 you really need to find some people to learn from. Good luck either way! 

You are correct that it does depend on the industry and what the requirements are specifically. For example, there may be a certification necessary or a license to practice. Obviously if you apply to drive a taxi, you need a license. In many industries, the requirements might be a bit more loose, and the company is listing the ideal candidate. Even if they list both 'requirements' and 'nice to haves', firms will often overlook certain required elements that are missing, especially if you possess one of the required skills that is very rare and hard to find. If you have a rare skill that is listed as required but are missing another required skill, I would certainly give it a shot. Good luck to you. 

The recruiter will absolutely want to talk to you, the former co-worker may or may not want to talk to you. In this situation, why not reach out to the recruiter directly? It doesn't seem that you are tight with your former co-worker, so chances are he/she will not be giving you some sort of glowing reference (if you expect the former co-worker will give a reference, it might be best to go through him/her). You can connect to this recruiter on LinkedIn without involving your contact, who may or may not honor your request anyway. Recruiters connect to a lot of people, so having your connection request sent by your former co-worker is by no means any kind of ringing endorsement. There is a fairly good chance the recruiter and your contact are not close either, and may not even remember each other. If you send the request through your former co-worker, there is a chance he/she won't send the request along, leaving you in some sort of LinkedIn purgatory. Contact the recruiter directly, through LinkedIn or another means (search for an email address on the LinkedIn card or on the web, or even a phone call). That takes all the mystery out of it and makes you look like an ambitious potential employee. The recruiter will love getting a call from someone that wants a job, assuming you are a qualified individual. Good luck. 

Technical recruiter here that has seen many thousands of resumes, and I've never seen "Technical Expertise" used on a resume (I'm in the US). The most accepted sections for that title would be either "Skills", "Technical Skills", "Technologies", or "Technical Experience". 

Delaying this offer gives you the risk of losing this offer. The old 'bird in the hand' cliche. If you are willing to risk losing the offer, tell the company that you are still in your job search and assessing other offers. They may ask 'is there anything we can do to expedite your decision?', which generally means 'how much more money do you want'? If it's a money issue and they ask you that, I'd tell them 'if you up the offer to $X I will start on mm/dd'. Your success in talks with this company and others that make offers is very closely tied to demand for your skills. If you are a highly coveted professional with a rare skill set that is in high demand, you can expect companies to allow you to delay your decision (at your own potential peril, as they will surely continue interviewing other candidates). If your skills are relatively common, your request to delay an answer will not be honored. Companies generally will not take kindly to candidates that they feel are using their offer and shopping it to other companies to try and start a bidding war. If your skills are rare, you may have some success with this tactic (I'm not saying that is what you are doing), but it can often backfire. If you like the current offer and company, I think the first step is to ask yourself 'what would another offer have to look like for me to turn this existing offer down'? If you can picture what that other offer would be, and you feel you have a reasonable expectation of finding that ideal position, you probably shouldn't accept this offer under any circumstances (unless you just really need a paycheck). Good luck. 

You've told this person that he/she is wrong and you have not been persuasive enough to change their mind. If you believe this strongly and are willing to take on a bit of risk to help all parties involved (you, your boss, and your company), you need to show your boss that you are correct. Here are a couple ideas: 

Again, this is pretty standard counter offer stuff here, but usually they match it to the dollar or even go above the other offer. They promise you a more interesting role and responsibility. That doesn't mean that the promise is an empty one, but that is what companies do. 

This particular scenario comes up often when dealing with software engineers that are working on government projects that require a Top Secret clearance. Of course, it is easy to tell people that a project is secret based on government clearance, and you won't hear follow-up questions about what the project was. Generally, you would be able to detail the technologies that you used. There are also scenarios where you could have been working for an illegal business without even knowing it. For example, if you were building technologies that individually were seemingly harmless and used by what appeared to be a legitimate business, but you later found out they were used to power a gambling website, the portion of the work that you did was not illegal or even unethical. I would, in this case, list the experience completely and not the company name or details about the business (if asked, you should reveal the full truth). Unless you need to list this on the resume (for reasons of needing to show how you developed a skill or to fill a gap on the resume), it is probably best to leave it off. If you do include it, give the relevant details only. 

If you are the sole web developer of a small company where you have no mentor, it sounds like your current employer is not a great place for you to be as a 22 year old. You have nobody else to learn from and you feel you are underpaid (a notion that was confirmed when you were offered a whopping 70% increase with a new offer). At your age you would generally be better off at a job with a mentor and with co-workers that you could learn from, even if you were making less money. 

Recruiter's perspective: One problem I see when candidates list too many categories is that you end up with too large a 'Skills' section on the resume, and then candidates wonder why their resume is 5 pages long. Being thorough is good, but you also want to be sure to keep the resume to an acceptable length. I've seen skills sections broken down into 10 categories, which ends up taking an entire page for some. I usually have candidates use Languages, Databases, Operating Systems, and then a catch-all such as Tools. You can include frameworks, app servers, testing tools, those API's, and a host of things in the Tools section. Keep in mind the initial reader/screener is probably someone in HR that is looking for a particular buzzword, and where it is categorized is often beyond the scope of resume screeners. You certainly want to categorize as accurately as possible, but if it's taking up half a page of your resume you should reconsider, especially (as in the example above) if you only have one single item to list under a category.
