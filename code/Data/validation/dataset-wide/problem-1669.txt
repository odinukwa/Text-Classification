The anthropological consensus does appear to be that the Mayans believed the earth was flat - at least as a generalization. Sifting reliable sources from the hundreds of pages of woo is extremely difficult, but here are some relatively good references I have found: 

The man who took the photos, Danny Lyon, has come forward and identified the photos as taken by him and being of Sanders. He was the campus photographer who documented the events for publication, not just some guy who took a few photos. He has the contact sheets - prints made directly from the roll of film he exposed. 

When asking "who was the first to fly?" the question is usually interpreted to mean "who was the first to achieve powered, controlled flight in a heavier than air machine". That excludes a number of glider builders, the most prominent being Otto Lillienthal, who nonethless deserve credit for being great aviation pioneers and inventors, on whose shoulders the powered aircraft pioneers built their work. The best resource I have found on this subject is this article, detailing the work of some aviation pioneers contemporary and previous to the Wright Brothers. A number of people claim (or have claimed for them) powered controlled flight prior to the Wright Brothers, but all of them have difficulty with their claims. Here are a few extracts: 

Toilet seats are nothing special. That have that "ick" factor when people think about them, but in fact other places are worse. Here's a reference: 

It should be noted that the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine is largely defined by its advocacy of a Vegetarian/Vegan lifestyle. 

NOTE: While it may be argued that these comments provide no concrete evidence against Trump's claims, since Trump himself has offered no evidence in favour of them (such as even naming one of these supposed areas) a preponderance of dismissals by people better positioned than him to know the facts are all that is required to refute him. 

No, that is not technically true. [From article 1, section 4 of the Texas Constitution][1], bolding mine: 

Within the bounds of statistical uncertainty: Yes about one third of residents of Kansas own guns. And it's far from being the state with the highest gun ownership. There are plenty of surveys of gun ownership in the US, and figures for Kansas are generally in the low thirties. Some older surveys place it over 40%. Six states have gun ownership rates over 50%. If your friends are a representative sample of US residents overall, then yes, 1/3 of them own guns. Technically the surveys are of adults owning guns, so if children own fewer then the figure may be less than a million. But if you consider 'people living in a household where a gun is owned' I would expect that to bring it back over the million. Here are some references: 

While it is of course almost impossible to debunk a conspiracy theory (there is always a counter-rebuttal if you don't mind how improbable you get) here are a few points that would clearly indicate the ridiculousness of the idea. 

No Once upon a time on old car engines this was required, and piston engined aircraft warm up because they stress their engines to the maximum as the first thing they do. But this is no longer necessary for modern cars. The recommended warmup time vary between 15 seconds and three minutes. Canadian Department of Natural Resources: 

The question "has [she] said anything on record to this effect?" is too vague to answer, and even considering it gives unwarranted credibility to someone making stuff up and attaching it to a picture. The burden of evidence is clearly on anyone claiming she has said things like this to at least give a plausible date. Actual plausible claims with dates attached can still be investigated. 

The article you quote says that several studies have been done that confirm the 'Canadian effect', so I think we can take it as true. However it's important to note that it is specific to the 2009 H1N1 flu strain. There is no evidence that the effect would be repeated with other flu strains, pandemic or otherwise. There is no possible way to interpret this as indicating any reason to not take the flu vaccine. 

I'm not sure this is really a good answer, but in the absence of others I started looking at Congresspeople who joined the House in 1999. 

The Newsweek article which appears to be the ultimate source of this quote does not seem to give any explanation of where the figure comes from. Here's the whole paragraph: 

The specific claim you talk about are one of the dubious additions, for which Snopes was unable to find any supporting evidence, and which they are highly skeptical of. 

As per The Hindu article, there certainly were Indian pilots during WWI. Lt Indra Lal Roy joined the RFC in 1917 and became India's first flying ace, being awarded the genuine, existing medal of the Distinguished Flying Cross. 

The Snopes article gives links to the media reports. The march was in celebration of Polish independence. While there was a distinct anti-EU theme to the march, not all were protesting Muslim immigration specifically. 

Yes and No Acording to this article there is sound science underlying the original weekly alcohol consumption recommendations. 

As well as assessing the chance that they could have successfully made the crossing, they also looked for evidence of the men being alive. Did none of these people ever make contact with their loved ones, even in secret? Did none of them appear in a safe country decades after and offer to write a book about their experiences? Did nobody in the area report seeing three wet guys getting into a car? So the summary you have is probably the truth. While it is possible that these men survived, escaped, and hid out for decades, it's unlikely. EDIT: Since I've been asked for references for the above quote, here they are. Note that the reference was actually given in the question, which is where I took the statement from. 

This is absolutely true. The theory is called Preformationism, and was widely (though not exclusively) believed in some form from Ancient Greek times until the 17th century. Pythagoras and Aristotle are among the philosophers associated with this theory. Some qualifications: spermatozoa were not known to exist until the invention of the microscope. However it was widely believed that the 'essence' of the child came from the father, and the mother provided 'material for growth'. The theory does not also claim that "a child would be born just because of the sperm". The father's 'seed' still has to be 'planted' in a mother, which was assumed to be an essential part of the process. There were also people who believed the reverse, that the child's essence came from the mother, with the father providing the 'trigger' to make it grow. 

Official answer: we aren't sure, but probably not. Here is an article from the Mayo Clinic which says: 

The testing is done by the company that wants to sell the drug, and the results verified by the FDA. 

This site provides a huge amount of information on contrails, and specifically debunks many of the conspiracy allegations. 

Not one of them mentions bankruptcy or anything similar. The remaining motions all touch on similar themes. Given the running theme of the decrees cited, I would assume that the document you quote is the work of gold standard fanatics, who believe that all the US financial problems (and probably many others) are a direct result of leaving the gold standard, and that the US 'stole' its people's gold when it substituted fiat money for gold-backed currency. Bankruptcy to such people means that the US no longer has sufficient physical gold to exchange everybody's paper money if they all tried to do so at once, a definition which is not followed by any nation or institution. The claim also refers to the Council of State Governments as a 'socialist committee', which gives you an idea of the color of spectacles it is using to view the world. The technical definition of bankruptcy is that of an entity having debts larger than its assets. There is nothing in the claim cited that indicates this to be true, and given the size of US government assets would be extremely unlikely. 

However his original teachings have been modified and devolved on the internet into tips of doubtful validity: 

Summary The consensus is that many people can regularly use Marijuana without becoming addicted. However there appear to be some people who can become psychologically and physically dependent on it. 

A point-by-point rebuttal would be (ahem) pointless. The view of the courts was that the declaration by the states that they had ratified the amendment, and the assessement by the Secretary of State that sufficient states had done so, is enough to validate the amendment. Wording variations were considered too trivial to affect the outcome. Even if Benson's historical facts were 100% accurate, they would not affect the validity of the amendment. The promulgation of these arguments has in fact been declared to be fraud. 

It's likely that Ireland never had snakes. This article by national Geographic says that there is no evidence of them having ever been there. 

Most of the others quote the exact same wording. The single source for all of these seems to be the book Frontier Violence: Another Look by W. Eugene Hollon. I have not been able to retrieve the entire text of this book to check the references. However the two claims are not consistent. For 45 killings over 15 years to give a murder rate of 1 per 100,000 this would imply that the total population of the five towns was more than 300,000. This is obviously not true. Dodge City had a population of around 1,200 and Abilene had a population of around 500. The entire state of Kansas had a population of only slightly more than 300,000 in 1870. And of course a figure of 1 per 100,000 is massively contradicted by other sources. For Abilene, in any year in which at least one killing took place (presumably most of them, since the years with no killings are specifically mentioned) Abilene would have had a murder rate per 100,000 of 190 - again much higher than any modern US city. It is also recorded that Tom 'Bear River' Smith, Marshal of Abilene, was killed ten miles outside Abilene in November 1870 (in a year in which Libertarian Standard says no killings took place in Abilene), meaning that the definitions of "killings in Abilene" must have been taken very narrowly to reach these figures. An interesting quote in Meithe et. al. Is that "most killings involved drunken brawls among willing participants, and public tolerance was indicated by the widespread acceptance of self defence as justification. " 

As is usual with political claims, it really depends on your viewpoint and your definitions. As Max says in his answer, there are three House Republican sponsored bills that claim to be related to jobs. On closer inspection what they actually mandate is: 

There are unsurprisingly plenty of studies in this area. The article you quote is one. However note it says "Long-term marijuana use can lead to addiction" not "Long-term marijuana use leads to addiction". The results very from person to person. Here is another article: from the University of Wisconsin-Madison: 

EDIT:I found better figures so I'm updating the wealth values. This does change my conclusions somewhat. The MacKinsey Global Institute conducted a study of the wealth of the world . Wealth was defined in the economic sense of assets minus liabilities. All figures are for the year 2010. 

The Washington Post article has fact checked this, and President Obama made reference to the bust on his 2016 visit to Britain. 

There are several ways of mesuring 'busiest airport', but the one being used here is 'aircraft movements' (i.e. a landing or takeoff). The airport listed as the worlds busiest over a year, according to Wikipedia, is Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta airport with around 900,000 movements a year. Several others are in the same range. Assuming that their traffic is approximately the same over the year, that works out at 17,000 movements a week. During the week of "The Airshow" Wittman Regional is busier than Hartsfield-Jackson. I would be surprised if weekly variations in traffic at any of the very busy major airport took their weekly traffic to over 25,000 movements. However I have no way of knowing if some other one-off event converted some other small airfield to an even more crowded aviation hub. It seems unlikely. The Independent says: 

It's notable that the quote you cite from Al Gore himself is not that he invented the internet, but that he "took the initiative in creating it". Creating something like the internet is not the same thing as inventing it, just as saying that Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone is not the same as saying he created the telephone network. (It happens that he played a part in the latter also, but the two don't have to be related.) To summarize: the claims that Al Gore made for himself are largely justified. The truth of claims that other people say he made are dependent on your definition of 'invention', and so subject to opinion. 

and many more. I recommend this Google search for a bigger list. It seems that temperature is a factor, so there is no single worldwide altitude above which mosquitos cannot live - it varies from place to place. It is clear that the mosquito line altitude is measured in the thousands of feet - the height of a New York apartment building is not going to make a difference. 

Yes, to some extent The way our eyes detect bulges on a body is largely due to lighting effects. We can see that someone has a bulging belly because lighting cues give away the contours. The same is true of wrinkes - we see them because of lighting patterns. Wearing black reduces those lighting cues, and the bulging belly isn't as obvious to the eye; nor are the wrinkles. It works for other bulges too - I've read stories from actresses saying costume designers made them pad their breasts in scenes where they were going to be wearing black or in dim lighting. Another point is that our eyes really do see dark objects as (slightly) smaller. It's an optical illusion; that's exactly what 'looking thinner' is all about. This effect is obviously limited. If you are looking at someone in silhouette, side on, wearing black will make no difference to how fat they look. And black can't work miracles. And black won't fool someone making a careful examination of you. But yes, black can make you seem a little thinner under some circumstances to the casual observer. References for this are hard to come by (since scientific journals don't usually include a fashion column). Here is a really good one looking at the science behind fashion in general. It includes a reference to the optical illusion that underlies all this. Here is another more explanatory article.
