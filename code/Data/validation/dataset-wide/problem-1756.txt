From what I understand, it also depends on the file system on the drive. Some file systems are more resilient to things like disk fragmentation. 

Definitely get a whiteboard. You can use it to setup to do lists, draw up configurations to visualize the problem, and much more. It's also good for when you have a group discussing solutions to network problems. 

At our organization we use a series of shared Outlook calendars to schedule out our conference rooms. All domain users are setup as authors of these calenders. We are now running into a problem where the end user is either not checking/caring if a room already has an appointment assigned to the room for the period of time that they want to use it. So my question is this: Is there any way to prevent a user from scheduling an appointment or meeting on one of these calendars when there is already a preexisting one on it? We've already tried going into Options -> Resource Scheduling and checking "Automatically decline conflicting meeting requests," but this did not resolve the issue. 

A3: If you trust your co-workers, there is no reason why you couldn't share a single ssh/sftp account. I do suggest that you disable FTP completely, if you can or at the very least disable FTP for that user. Since your site has already been compromised, also make sure all your passwords are changed. All of them: mysql, apache, root, and any other users or accounts. 

We have WSUS pushing updates out to our user's workstations, and things are going relatively well with one annoying caveat: there seems to be an issue with a pop-up being displayed in front of some users informing them that their machine will be rebooted in 15 minutes, and they have nothing to say about it: 

You may want to give squid a try, if you're not using it already. It's a data-caching application for commonly transferred data. It may not be able to cache Windows Updates, but it should help you save bandwidth, which seems to be your goal. $URL$ 

As it turns out, the problems with the display had to do with some outdated custom plugins that were designed for the Access implementation. 

I am running into an issue with a user whose Word document is somehow turning itself into Read-Only. The user is using Word 2003 and is accessing a document that is in a Server 2008 share. The document itself starts out as a normal, editable document (user has Full Control permissions), and the user is able to save and do the 'normal' things you would do to a document. However, after a couple of saves, the document turns to Read-Only (according to the title bar) even though the Read-Only attribute is not checked on the document's properties. Here is some additional information about the situation: *User has approximately 5-8 Word documents open at a time *User saves the document frequently (sometimes at a frequency of once per minute) *Once the document is closed it will open as a normal document if reopened *When the document does turn to Read-Only the user will do a "Save As" on the document and save it as FILENAME # where # is some increment of how many times this has happened (some documents are up to their 30th iteration) I understand that there is probably some room for user education here and that they could just be copying the RO document to a new one, closing and opening the RO doc, then copying all the information back. However, I would like to get to the route cause of the problem and try to stop it from happening in the first place. 

I do not want users to be forced to restart their computer whenever the computer thinks it should happen (unless it's after an update installation and there are no logged in users). That doesn't seem productive to force a system restart in the midst of a person's workday. Is there something that I can do with the GPO that would help make WSUS less intrusive? Even if it gave the user an option to Restart Later - that would be better than what is happening now. edit The goal is to be able to automatically download and install updates every night, and rebooting the machine only if there are no users logged on when the machine wants to reboot. If Windows has to nag the user about rebooting, this is perfectly fine - as long as they have an option to postpone that reboot. edit It turns out, we have some deadlines set on some updates (SP3, Client-Side Extensions, etc.), and with the post found below, some light has been shed on the situation: $URL$ 

UPDATE: Apparently the reinstall did not fix the issue. I researched the issue a bit more and found that disabling the background save may take care of it, but I haven't had a chance to try it yet. Does anyone else have any other ideas? 

We are in the planning stages of deploying a SharePoint server that will be used for our organization's intranet. As part of the deployment, we are going to be centralizing all of the internal documents. As you can imagine, there is no standardization of the filenames for the internal documents that have already been created. What I would like to do is setup some form of standardization between the filenames now and those going forward to keep the intranet organized and uniform. What I am looking for is any resources or wisdom on how others have organized documents for their networks and on any best practices on general naming conventions that are/have been used. I realize that every deployment will be different, but I'm just looking for a general direction to be pointed in to get started. 

You can delegate control of IIS sites and applications to users, much like you can delegate rights to objects in Active Directory. See the link for instructions. A few more links to help out: $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ 

You may want to ditch DHCP on the wireless router and use the Windows DHCP Server. It's a bit more robust than your average wireless router (though, I don't know what you have so that may or may not be true). Either way, there are two things you may be missing that is preventing users on the domain from accessing the internet: a default gateway, and dns servers. In your DHCP server, make sure you are passing out a default gateway with the address of your wireless router, and also the address of whatever is serving DNS for you. If it's your domain controller, then hand out that address. If it's your wireless router, then hand that address instead. You can check what these values are on your desktops by doing an ipconfig /all command from the command line. If you are missing one or either, or they are pointed to the wrong place, the "internet" won't work as expected. Look for Default Gateway and DNS Servers ip addresses. It should look something like this (this is a Windows 7 snapshot on my LAN): 

I am working with an Enterprise level Access database. This database contains some basic data entry fields and buttons such as "Find," "Submit," "Clear," etc. We are, at the same time, updating our user's Microsoft Office Suites to the 2007 version. What we are now finding is that these form buttons are disappearing from the Access forms when using Access 2007. The strange this is that the buttons are still there function-wise and will appear after you click them. Has anyone encountered this or have any ideas on how to fix it? Edit The file the user is working on is an .ade. As far as I can tell the original database/forms were created in Access 2003. 

I have been working on a project to map out my organization's network infrastructure. For the networking devices (we are a Cisco shop) I have been running the command to see how everything is connected and through which interface. I am noticing that our ASA is not showing up in the output of these commands (it is connected to a Cisco switch). I ran a command list via and CDP does not show up as an option. My question is this: is there a command similar to that will show to which devices the ASA is connected? 

A1: Media Temple offers a way to create multiple users with access to SSH/SFTP in their "shared" hosting plan - they call it the Grid. $URL$ 

FTP data (including login credentials) is transmitted in plain text, which is why it is so insecure. You definitely want to start making a habit of using SFTP as your data would be encrypted then. 

72.165.117.130 is one of our private (MPLS) WAN addresses that routes to 63.145.168.58. I'm trying to forward traffic sent to that address to an internal device at 10.0.1.40. Is that all there is to creating a one-to-one NAT, or am I missing something? 

We are running Exchange 2003 Standard in-house. The Director of Operations has just let two staff members go, and would like e-mail sent to their addresses sent to him. Here is what I have done so far:
