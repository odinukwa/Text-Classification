Do not go behind your current manager's back. Make sure you have documentation (reviews, emails, etc) about how well you've performed. Tell your current manager about your career goals and that you're serious enough about this transfer that you went and got your own training. Your manager may not want to let you go and could start treating you negatively (Some people are petty and vindictive) or realize you want to improve yourself. Hopefully you won't be faulted for wanting more out of your career or at least go into the type of work you'll enjoy more. You want to make sure the new manager for the job you'll be applying has access to your performance records to this date. This will be an attempt to make sure your current manager doesn't start giving you a bad appraisal. It would look very suspicious. Think about how you will work in your current position if you do not get the transfer. Hopefully your boss will be happy to keep a good employee and neither of you will have any bad feelings towards one another. 

If the head of your department wants you to go for coffee regularly, you go. If it's just colleagues, you should try to go on some sort of regular basis. This is where you really find out what is going on in your work world. This helps people put a face to a name and treat you more like a person. Yes you can connect over the Internet, but that should help enrich other relationships or maintain those that are physically distant. It's not a substitute for one on one interaction in person. If you don't feel you do well in person, you can always limit your coffee breaks, but I would recommend using it as an opportunity to improve your inter-personal skills. 

There's no reason you can't assess your own performance based on your input/role, the team's performance as a whole along with the feedback they give you. I wouldn't value anyone's assessment of their performance with a team if it didn't include team feedback. I would also include whether or not you enjoy working with a team or if there are certain team traits you prefer or would want to avoid. Working with a team is not for everyone. Get as much information as you can on how you'd be expected to behave and what would be required regarding being in a team. There are advantages to autonomy as far as having more decision making authority, but people are social to a certain extent; decide where you fit on the spectrum. 

This is specific to the company and hiring manager. Large companies go through a lot of trouble to set these up and HR isn't just going to create a new position so you can feel good about yourself. A startup will call you Guru if it makes you feel better. 

I think a better habit is getting those emails messages out of your email system completely and into Evernote or some other information management system. They usually have better search tools. 

Wait for an offer, but be prepared with your reason to ask for more. It is possible you've learned more about this position during the interview process. When were you given the complete list of benefits? How long have you had to think about the position? You're always going to justify any increase, so get in the practice of understanding what you're worth. 

I don't see any advantage, but that just might be my lack of asthetics. Including the months in a resume/cv is so common, it may bring uncessary attention to an area you're trying to de-emphasize. At best the highering person will ask you to clarify during an initial interview. Otherwise, they may think you're trying to hide something. I don't think the minimalist approach you're taking is going to make a noticable difference, but everyone appreciates the effort to have a cv that gets to the point. 

There are times when your resume will get printed to paper so the functionality of the hyper-links are lost. These codes can maintain them. You also could be at a job fair passing out your resume in paper form already. I don't know how much a typical HR office would utilize them. I think it makes sense in places where the recipient has a QR Code scanner (cell phone) available. It could be at a conference or some other business event with a social aspect, but this would be on a business card. It's a convenient way to give someone your resume or portfolio of work. A shorter URL may be more impressive or just convenient. 

I think the problem is this notion of "only working with information" is what skews the perspective. Most jobs don't operate in this type of void. Interpersonal communication is still important and the in person aspects are taken for granted. Here are some examples: 

You have to understand that estimates are perfect. The problem may be that your boss is making promises to others based on your estimates and doesn't have to enjoy telling them (clients?) it's not going to happen. If this is the case, make sure you're giving yourself more time and don't assume everyone expects everything ASAP. 

If you get yelled at, take some time to get over it and schedule a private meeting. Let the person know that you don't respond well to being yelled at and if they want you to fix an error and work to prevent future errors, they shouldn't yell at you. Part of being professional and an adult is sticking up for yourself, but you have to do it the right way. Either these people will respect and appreciate how you handle the situation or they won't. At least you will have done your part. Hopefully, you won't have to leave. I've known a few people who have had luck with this. In one case, when the supervisor was going to yell at the entire team, it was suggested to this person to not attend the meeting. Not ideal, but at least there was some respect for this individual. 

I don't know what your budget is or what level of salary is really profitable, so they may have a point. On the other hand, it's easy for them to make that statement when they don't have to work with these people on a day-to-day basis. Good people are often currently employed, so they may not be willing to leave without a getting the salary they want. You have to decide if this person is going to continue to ask for things and push the limits or once you get past the salary hurdle, they'll feel better about accepting the job and make this a non-issue. Inform your boss that you don't intend on giving them everything they ask for which will benefit the company when bonuses and raises come up. You have some legitimate ground to stand on when they ask for too much and you can justify the current situation by stating you gave them what they wanted. They will look greedy and not you. If the project is a success, no body will think about this, but you are putting yourself at risk in the eyes of your bosses. I hope your unwillingness to play a childish salary negotiating game pays off for you in the long-run. If they feel that strongly about it, they should cut your salary budget and take on some of the responsibility - yeah right. 

Ask the manager to help you understand why eating lunch every day with the team is important. Then ask if there is any amount of frequency you could eat at home. Would once a month present a problem? Are there other things you could do that would accomplish the same thing as attending lunch with coworkers? Management often over-thinks things some employees do in an attempt to prevent foreseeable problems. Other team members getting jealous or wanting the same privilege is a common reason. Company's aren't a democracy, but it would be nice if a manager had more communication with the team to better understand what will put them off. Maybe your getting to go home for lunch just bothers the others for who knows what reason. Until you get more information, I don't see anyone being able to help you very much. 

Show your ambition by selling your employer on the idea of creating a career path that has several levels of developer. Maybe you get a little more into design and have input for planning and take on more code review, but still focus on programming. For many, programming shouldn't be a introducty phase of their career, but a career itself. Now if your company is getting stale in their development needs and everything is the same support for the same codebase, this could be difficult to sell, but do it anyway. 

Because HR's task is to initially find a few potential candidates and not properly evaluate each and every candidate. Of course if they use years of experience, they'll exclude qualified candidates (and they don't care) and they run the risk of including some candidates who do not qualify. There are other criteria they can use to continuously weed out the pack. They even have the luxury of not filling some positions and can claim there are no suitable candidates. Many technologists feel there are too few qualified people in their fields, so it is very frustrating to see qualified candidates get passed over because they don't have enough years of experience in the specific matrix of skills required or they lack some social skill nuance unrelated to the job. Also, years of experience can show that someone has at least been willing to show up for work and met some semblance of approval from a previous employer. In your example, someone may have great coding skills, but with no job experience, it is difficult to determine if they will make the effort needed and get along with everyone and all the other skills needed to perform the job. 

Time of day - Some places have slow starters, so it's all right to chat while coffee is brewing. People say, "Hello" to everyone when they walk in or leave, but stop doing it throughout the day. There may be those that want to get their day in order, so the first thing in the morning they check email, calendars, etc. and prepare for the day. Some may save personal activities for lunch hour our some other acceptable break time. Location - In an open space, they may provide private places for phone calls. I worked at one place where people would only take breaks in the break room and never at their desk. You may have to resort to using a mobile device in the cases where it is more appropriate to do away from your desk. Who Cares? - It may not be a big deal at all, but some supervisors may be more likely to comment on it than others. I've seen some senior executives get wrapped up more than the direct supervisor on getting to work on time and other perceptions of slacking off. Some places are truly performance driven. Some companies preach work-life balance, so if people are spending more than a normal workday in the office, they're probably doing some personal things from time to time (otherwise the company as failed at this). Companies that have a lot of remote workers are probably more in tune with this practice. Be Open - Don't become the "Master of Alt+Tab" every time someone approaches your work area to hide what you're doing. It's just too obvious. Hopefully open space means open communication and not as a method to keep people from hiding. Talk about your interests to others. Let them know what your interests are. Offer to send a link to an article you're reading. Someone may find a way to enrich their learning or use that information to benefit the company. 

The difference in what fits your personal preference. I think what you see is what you get. Part of being a successful business is doing things other people don't want to or can't do. No job is a 100% blissful situation purely focused on saving mankind. Would you rather have work that sucks (because there will be moments when it will) and no Xbox or something else you do find enjoyable? They wore t-shirts and backwards caps because they like it and more importantly, want people to work there who like it. I can't speak for all of their clients, but if the company is successful, their clients probably don't care. It is possible that clients never come to the office. You want a traditional work environment, there are plenty out there. They may not come to this event at your university because they're not interested in putting on a Talent Show. They have jobs available for people who need a job. Send a resume and put on a coat and tie when you go to the interview. Be prepared for set office hours that will only be extended when the inevitable emergency occurs and never shortened. Their lawyers have warned them about having alcohol in the office. Managers don't want you playing games; you're there to work. Enjoy.
