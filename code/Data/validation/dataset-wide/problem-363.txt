It's all about the swarm. Overwhelm them with numbers. Rats and mice are territorial, you either get one or the other. A rat will kill a lone mouse, but the mice mob the rats and attack from all sides. Mice can breed up to very large numbers very fast as any Australian grain farmer will tell you. This is a numbers game my zerglings, just numbers. 

I come from a culture that doesn't do cremation, from my point of view death rituals are for the living and burial is fundamentally about recycling, the circle of life. From the soil we came and to the soil we return. For the sake of an AI that would be the crucible. They know who their makers are, they have no doubts about that. Whether they were built by biological people or by other AIs, where they came from is where they go back to, the crucible. Their circle of life is shorter and more direct, but let it remain a circle. They're recycled or melted down for parts for the next generation of AIs. 

Continued open warfare Having defeated Germany and Japan, degrading relations between east and west cause Russia and the US to move straight into open warfare. This prevents the build up of warheads to the point of MAD. Conventional strikes on development facilities mean numbers of weapons don't increase and technologies are much slower to develop. MAD was a symptom of two parties building up excess warheads over and above any practical requirement. Continued war footing changes the game. Weapons are constantly in use rather than building up in reserves. Mutual destruction may well still occur, but it's no longer assured. Not exactly a small change in history from our end, but how small a change was it at the time? It had been under 100 years since Britain was last in open war with Russia, but British troops had taken sides during the Russian civil war and Britain didn't recognise the USSR until 1924, so in real terms you're looking at barely over 20 years since the prior conflict. Even at the start of WWII, Britain had more recently been at war in Russia than with Germany. This was a seriously considered option by the name of Operation Unthinkable which included rearming the Wehrmacht on the way through to assist with the ongoing war. 

Access to lethal methods This is a very strange term, it literally means "having some way to kill yourself" but it's stronger than that as it often refers to also having the expertise with which to use said method. Vets have the drugs, farmers have guns, these are two of the highest risk groups in the UK for exactly this reason. Normal people (in the UK) very rarely actually have a reliable accessible method with which to kill themselves. Success rates including attempts and methods USA 2012(pdf) note the effectiveness of firearms attempts (90% success) followed by hanging (83% success) (BMJ) What your booth does is give everyone access to a way of killing themselves. By providing it you have effectively killed a large number of people who wouldn't otherwise have had a method of doing so. Jumping off bridges This is a key statistic, it goes with people taking overdoses then taking themselves to hospital. Far more people attempt suicide than succeed and one of the key factors in survival of an attempt is whether it's possible to stop halfway through. If the method chosen allows the person to abort, often they will. You're wanting to give them a quick, easy, reliable, painless method, but that's precisely what society works to take away. Suicide level crises are generally brief. Method There's another factor to preventing suicide I'm going to mention because I think this question needs it. Most people who are seriously considering suicide have a plan. That plan is fixed, it's an already solved problem that's fixated on, if you take away that method they often won't find another way to do it. Ask if they have a plan, take away access to that method of suicide and often they won't find another way. Given the background information above, here's the actual answer to the question Legal Suicide is legal (in the UK), but only since the suicide act of 1961. Prior to that you could be imprisoned for the attempt or your family could be prosecuted if you succeeded. Moral By providing the booths, and in light of the information above, the provider could be considered culpable for every single death that occurred as a result of their use. That's around 960,000 additional premature deaths a year in the US alone. When someone is seriously considering suicide, just like any other person who is sick or injured, we have a duty to help them. Handing them a loaded gun with the safety off is not the help they need. If they step into that booth and they're going to be in there for 4-6 hours, possibly even going to far as to have to book an appointment a couple of weeks in advance, talking to a counselor, putting their affairs in order, leaving messages for their family, having a decent meal, and free to walk away at any point, then perhaps this could be done. Then you could be said to have done what you could to help someone in need and that this is a person who has made a definite clear and conscious decision to die. A simple push a button and it's done for 25p, you'd have some questions to answer, mostly about reckless endangerment. Suicide Prevention, how to help. 

International money transfer shops and coffee shops. Both handle large amounts of cash, specifically for international transfer with not a lot of questions asked about where the money comes from or where it's going. Unfortunately the police also know this and they used to get shut down as fast as new ones sprang up in their place when I was living in areas that considered it part of the traditional business. 

To be able to interact with humans at a suitable level, robots need to be programmed to understand a human sense of aesthetics. The concept of beauty, balance and style are built in to their fundamental programming to allow them to perform basic tasks such as arranging the furniture and pictures in such a way that humans would find acceptable. As a result of this deliberate bias towards a human sense of an aesthetically pleasing environment, they're attracted to places that humans would also be attracted to, such as wooded river valleys. 

n.b. I'm assuming you're a Northerner and you mean the Bury that's next to Bolton not Bury St Edmunds which is also just known as "Bury". Extending Wigan, Bolton and Bury you're going to end up with a single continuous Urban area from Liverpool to Manchester with a northern extension. Which would be slightly larger than London is now. That's going to need some serious upgrades to transport connections to the smaller towns and larger villages in the surrounding area. 

This of course leads into the immortality depression and eventual probable suicide by increasing risk taking. There's a lot of work to be done on the brain before mere physical immortality will be psychologically viable. 

Genghis Khan had horses, he also had the vast Asian step on which to ride them, but look at that southern border where it traces round the edge of the Indian Subcontinent. Mountains. Alexander had horses and ships, he travelled round the Mediterranean and out as far as the Indian Subcontinent then he stopped at almost exactly the same border as the Golden Horde, at the mountains. Also his northern border at Armenia, mountains. The Romans were a Mediterranean and coastal empire. All roads might lead to Rome, but it's quicker by boat, their inland penetration from the coasts is relatively limited compared to the others. Now take a look at the geography round the American empires, they have that same limiting feature, they're stuck in the mountains. They just hit their mountains a lot sooner, a lot closer to home. If they'd crossed the mountains then they'd have hit the rain forest, also not an environment suited to fast travel. There'd be potential for a North American empire with horses, again across the plains, but South America is a dead loss until you can cross the mountains and clear the forest. Camels are going to be no better at crossing those mountains than horses. Transport is not a limiting factor until you can actually get out onto the plains. 

You need to apply a force equal to the excess force applied by the rotors above what's needed to keep the helicopter hovering plus the weight of the person holding it. I'll leave someone else to put some numbers to that, but it doesn't strictly need to be very much, just enough to destabilise the chopper should it try to move away. 

Ultimately it's going to be a very different story from one with FTL travel with an entirely different set of considerations. Either way Roddenberry was correct, the ship still travels at the speed of plot. 

Steampunk will fall when they run out of things to burn. On the whole it's a massively inefficient technological dead end. Depending on how thoroughly they've managed to burn everything and how bad the runaway global warming is in their wake, it's going to be a while before anything resembling a technological civilisation recovers from the ashes. Main requirement: Something new to burn Unfortunately they've gone through the wood and coal. If you're taking it to the limit, the oil and gas as well. Solar power is outside the steampunk scope, it's too sleek and clean, so if you want to rush into a new high tech society then they're going to have to learn solar power generation and centralised electricity distribution. Otherwise you're going to have to regrow the forests by some act of government, wood being crucial, leaving you with a deadzone of 20 years before anything can happen. When I say anything I mean you're going to have great difficulty working metals. Half your population might even struggle with cooking food. Swords and bows will have to wait, it's going to be rocks and scrap until you can make charcoal again. 

We are currently primarily steam powered, but we keep our steam far away in power stations and transfer its power by electricity rather than shafts and belts. This of course is not how everyone thinks of steampunk, it's too clean and neat. Not "punk" at all. What you're looking for is dirty, localised, small scale steam power, the real punk. 

Perhaps you could just teach people about the damage their way of life is doing to the world and that they should be more careful about disposable tat and plastic packaging. 

The first place we have to start here is the tried and tested examples. We're going to pick three; Soviet, Cuban, Kibbutz. Then we'll look at some of the European models. The Soviet revolution is the biggest, the most brutal. This is the one people think of first when you say "Communism" which is why it's generally a good idea to avoid the word, it's been contaminated by thoughts of Stalinism and Maoism. In practice Soviet Russia ended up so far from actual communism that it becomes irrelevant as an example. It's simply the one people think of, so I'd be remiss not to mention it. So we move on to the Cuban revolution. Again a dictatorial revolution, but one that removed a much nastier one who'd been backed by the US. Again the purges of people who opposed the new dictator, the usual story just a bit less brutal. In this case communism and the planned economy was better operated but an embargo by the powerful nearby USA, and the power plays of the cold war meant that it was hard to see what potential it could have had. Again communism was imposed on the population. The kibbutz model on the other hand, was surprisingly successful and many are still running in the original spirit over 100 years after the first was founded. The key differences from the others were: 1) Small scale units interacting, there was no central control. 2) It was entirely an opt in model. The European model or socialism light, the social democracy. The needs of the populations are usually met, healthcare is free, benefits pay rent+expenses (barely) when work is unavailable/impossible. Following on from this is the consideration of the basic income, another potential step towards a mostly automated economy where working is optional. The (possibly) logical conclusion of this model does not make a world without money, but a world where money is largely meaningless. Rich people buy gold from rich people and craftsmen sell bling to rich people, but the poor don't need money because everything needed is provided by the state. Anything beyond that, luxury goods, cars, holidays etc. is about whether you choose to work or not. The European baby steps and the kibbutz opt in models are the way to progress with this. The violent revolution models tend to lead to further violence, you can't impose your will on people that way, you need to show them a way to a better world and let them opt in, or opt out. Also centrally planned economies have never been successful, no matter how brilliant the people planning them. 

They could be traders. Once they complete a trade cycle with one planet they move on to the next. Bands of traders roaming the wild dangerous spaces between the stars. Not returning to the same system again for generations. Or follow the pattern of the tramp steamers. The tribe lives on board hauling cargo from one place to the next, then getting a new cargo to haul onward from there. Holding a grand fleet meet every generation to trade among themselves and prevent too much inbreeding. They could even be mercenaries, paid to fight all across the galaxy but never welcome to settle anywhere. Always moving on to the next war. 

They have certain downsides, lack of speed, power and handling in high winds for example. Often considered the biggest problem hanging round them is the Hindenburg, but there have been a lot of plane crashes since then and it's not so fresh in people's minds. 

If you can time this to split the Persian army in half then you've got an easy win on the war at your next battle. 

The quickest solution is to allow utter chaos, a good plague should do the trick. It'll mostly kill off the unhealthy, elderly and poor in overcrowded areas and the inability to dispose of the bodies fast enough will cause another bout of disease to kill off the rest of those overcrowded people. Problem solved. The rich and healthy (and western socialist countries) will survive, the people too poor to pay for healthcare die off. You're now living in a world without an underclass, everyone is rich educated and healthy, that's really cool! Until you see the cost of good go through the roof, but never mind that, by the way did the cleaners come through the office last night...oh right. 

What you need here is a little classical literature. In this case the Paradoxes of Defence, written in 1599 by George Silver. 

In scientific terms the edge of the universe is entirely yours to hypothesise about. We don't know if such a concept as the edge of the universe exists, nor what would happen if you reached it and certainly not what would happen if you crossed it. It's entirely possible that the laws of physics as you know them break down at a boiling leading edge and if you tried to cross it you'd just break down into your constituent quarks. It's also possible that no matter how far you go or how fast, you just keep finding more universe, or even end up back where you started if you go far enough. Let your imagination run wild about the rules when you get there, it's going to be a long long time before anyone can prove you wrong.
