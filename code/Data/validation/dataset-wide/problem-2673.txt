I think Korsgaard thinks this follows from her alternative deduction for the morality for Kant. Rejecting Kant's own approach in Groundwork 3 as garbled (who doesn't?) and not accepting it as a Faktum of reason, she proposes that we commit ourselves to universal rational action whenever we commit an action as a condition for engaging in action. I think you'll find roughly the same move happening in the "Creating the Kingdom of Ends" available in her volume of the same title. Basically, she thinks that in an imperfect world, we have a right to move towards a better world. In the process, she's rejecting Kant's requirement that we assume the people we are interacting with are making rational choices. Instead, we treat them like they ought to be making rational choices and adjust accordingly. Korsgaard maintains this is what Kant was saying all along. In both cases, what seems to happen is that we've undergone at least in my interpretation a shift that changes what we are doing substantiality from the classical projects they replace. Korsgaard seems to take Plato, Aristotle, and Kant to be seeking the same thing as she is: a description of just action under deliberative conditions. But the thing is that deliberative conditions were not considered important in any of these accounts. Plato's republic and Aristotle's polis are both forms of state that are not ultimately built around deliberation by all members but rather are different types of informed harmonies. In Plato's case, the harmony that brings us the closest to the ideal of Justice. In Aristotle's case, the form of life best suited to us as rational animals (as he understands that). Again, for Kant, this becomes a community of rational agents. But then we need to be careful not to confuse our common uses of rational with Kant's meaning. The Kantian meaning is very much a priori in its origin rather than derived from experience or what seems to make the best sense at the time. I would think for Plato that injustice in the republic is a failure to submit to one's place in the community or to act outside of the roles given by the guardians -- not to fail to involve everyone in the decision. 

I am going to suggest three different routes through which you can look at this question. The first is a Kantian route. Kant develops a moral theory around the idea that we are rational free creatures. For him, to act morally is to act rationally. Practically, this happens by acting in accordance with duty. For Kant, there are perfect and imperfect duties that attach to being the sort of creatures we are. Perfect duties describe those obligations that we can arrive at by excluding what is self-contradictory or contradictory in a world with the laws of nature (I am simplifying by leaving out some other formulations). Imperfect duties are those obligations that follow from our nature as fragile beings. The question you are asking falls under the realm of imperfect duties for Kant. This can be shown as follows: if everyone became a medical doctor, then your becoming a medical doctor would not contribute to the alleviation of suffering (since presumably there would be an excess of medical care), therefore there's no perfect duty that people become medical doctors. Imperfect duties, by contrast, work on human limitations, viz., that we will all need help. This creates two types of obligations: (1) to improve yourself and (2) to provide aid in some circumstances. Here, the primary question relates to (1) but also touches on (2). From a Kantian perspective, you have freedom in how you go about improving yourself and also in how you provide aid, but you are obligated to do both. Thus, there's no clear Kantian reason why you should pursue medicine over string theory. At the same time, if string theory is a talent you think cannot be of use to others, you will need to find other ways of helping others. 

"Teleological explanations" are partially boogey man in contemporary science and philosophy of science. It's a shorthand used to mean bad science that was driven by the idea that everything moves towards the sun. Part of the reason is that at one point, Newton's explanation of gravity was somewhat controversial as was the heliocentric view of the solar system. These were considered to contradict "teleology." This is not necessarily connected with what teleology as philosophy ever really meant, but it is similar insofar as teleology means that things are moving towards their telos (end). Thus, what Sandel is saying is that "we are no longer ignorant in our understanding of science and now understand science in terms of mechanics and modern physics". But then Sandel rightly captures that justice involves ends and the means by which we work towards those ends which is a type of teleology. 

does not turn out to be identical to also knowing B. You're missing that in stating the "Notice that the conclusion doesn't state anything new" and "it just restates things that we already know." At least for human beings our knowledge seems to work in such a way where we don't always draw the material implication from our set of assumptions. Instead, we have to engage in thought to get there. In other words, my claim is that math and other disciplines do involve adding knowledge, because knowing what would imply that you should know something else is not identical to actually knowing that something else. (It would be for a perfect logic machine or for God, because the mode through which they know things is different from our process of thought). 

I think this question is best answered with reference to Medieval philosophy. A basic concept in Medieval metaphysics is that effects need a sufficient cause. On Descartes' account of the soul's capacities, we have a limited capacity to know but an unlimited capacity to will. This creates error within us as we can will beyond the bounds of our knowledge. Thus, your question's answer depends on what you mean by cognition. If you mean the ability to think, then the question is whether this is the ability to think to act or the ability to think to know. On Descartes' account, the latter is limited by the sort of being that we are. We cannot have knowledge in the same way God does. If the former, then this remains unlimited insofar as we control our actions. Both will for Descartes lead to proofs for God's prior necessity for our existence. If we look at our ability to will, then we need a cause sufficient to enable infinite willing. The proof is by regression. Either the direct cause of a human can give it a free will or it cannot not. If it can give it a free will, it is omnipotent and possesses a free will. If not, then it is insufficient to produce a truly free will. The latter would lead to an infinite series of real things which is considered unacceptable in medieval metaphysics. Ergo, there must be a cause that is infinite, e.g. God. If we look at our ability to know, then on Descartes' account, we will discover knowledge of the infinite. This knowledge exceeds our imagination (ability to make things up). Ergo, it must have a real external existence sufficient to merit to our knowledge of it. If it were not infinite, it would need to be similar enough to fool us. We must assume we are not so thoroughly deceived (or wind up in the radical skepticism Descartes rejects). Ergo, our knowledge of the infinite proves there is an infinite, e.g. God. Needless to say, there are several lines of critiques available to reject both approaches: (1) Descartes' arguments only proves we need a cause that exceeds our ability to know (reject equation between this and God, (2) we don't need to reject the possibility of actual infinities (reject medieval assumption), (3) We can believe that we made up the idea of infinity to fulfill our fantasies (reject connection between logic an reality), (4) we can assert that we only prove the existence of a being that asserts our capacities not that such a being is identical with God (reject omnipotence of the cause). These are just a few off the top of my head. 

But claim 3 is not trivially true. And that's the challenge here. It seems to follow sometimes but not always. The root question is whether that something will be the case is the cause that something will be the case or merely the observation that something will be the case. There's a very large debate about the nature of necessity and the meaning of necessity that also gets involved here. If there's only one form of necessity than 3 seems to follow. If there's multiple forms of necessity, then it is conceivable that something is necessary but non-causitive insofar as the necessity is metaphysically contingent on something and granting that there's a distinction between logical sequence and temporal sequence. You need the second because merely because something is temporally necessitated (through the stative nature of the future) does not mean that it's origination is logically necessitated (in the manner in which prior present and future events relate). 

For this argument, Descartes can hold all other things as dubitable (as he eloquently writes at the beginning of Med I and again at Med II). In other words, while he's doing so, he can continue to doubt his memory, etc. the situation. Your objection conversely seems to require a B-theory approach to the situation. There's no specific and privileged now, there's just indexed moments in time which constitute an indifferent dubitable series. But there's no reason Descartes can't accept (for the sake of his argument) that all accounts / recollections of time, memory, and the existence of anything at any given time t are dubitable. In fact, it seems like he does. What he then does is conjoin this a privileged notion of the now such that in the "now" -- not before or after, there's an indubitable claimant to consciousness. I think what you're seeing in the replies to objections is that he's not trying to make the argument static ("proposition" is a word with a specific meaning in the scholastic vocabulary Descartes learned rather than what we learn now based on 19th and 20th century logic and philosophy of language). 

Both of the other answers refer to a common theory of knowledge from the 20th century called "justified true belief", which defines knowledge as believing something under the conditions that it is justifiable for you to do so. One recent challenge to this idea is the Gettier problems. These problems have helped to buoy the view that knowledge should not be understood in terms of belief but rather as a successful type of action. John Greco and Ernest Sosa have both done very interesting work on this point. Sosa argues for virtue epistemology which defines to knowledge in the following manner: 

There's several other issues that people have thought of with respect to this. And to address the above, there are now several variants of utilitarianism. A philosopher named Hare worked on what we call rule utilitarianism vs. act utilitarianism which suggests that the task in individual cases is to follow rules which are designed to optimize pleasure (rather than calculating what is most pleasant every time de novo). With this background in mind, let's return to your claim: 

I think the majority of the philosophical arguments around gay marriage and gay adoption have been within the realm of political philosophy. Here, there are two major ideas at work in contemporary society: 

Clearly contemporary atheists and others show that this being socially evolved to believe in the uniformity of science and to have morality is possible without God. But that's not quite the same as proof that you can get to atheism without going through some sort of belief in God. Turning to your alien example, let's say we find an alien society that does not believe in God. Since we are asking about a step in social evolution, that's not enough. We would then somehow need strong proof or sufficient evidence that they never did believe in a God.
