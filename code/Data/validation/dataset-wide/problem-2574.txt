It depends if it's the appropriate time and the appropriate place and the appropriate intention. Red flags? Like the teacher smoking cigarettes or the teacher who drinks regularly and calls it crazy wisdom or the teacher who only knows the Dhamma through just studying books and no experience? It is possible that an unexperienced teacher could lead one to liberation while missing out on it themselves, yes? 

Practice the Eightfold Path. Practice metta and compassion for short term relief of anger. Practice some form of mindful meditation for permanent relief of anger and suffering. Maybe you already know but just in case anyone doesn't know, it's good to practice the Dhamma as opposed to just looking at it and studying it intellectually. The Dhamma is something to do, to make good karma with and let go of bad karma. Practicing the Dhamma is like driving a car to Nirvana City. If you admire cars, don't start the car and just learn how it can move on the road then that is like only studying the Dhamma. At the most it is like pushing the car to a better place but not clear to Nirvanaville although anything is possible but it would be a very rare occurrence so it wouldn't be wise to count on not practicing and only studying. That's what I have been taught and what my experience tells me so take it as my opinion as always. 

I asked Bhante Yutthaddhammo this question. I think he got frustrated with the question or maybe all questions. Bhante was probably frustrated as a teacher because students often are thinking about Buddhism more than actually practicing Buddhism not that pondering things has no place in the practice. All things are no self means whatever we experience, that experience is not a self, it's no self or soul. Just because we can't find something doesn't always mean it's not there. For all we know there is a self or a not a self or the self is imperminant or not imperminant or maybe it's just a giant hot dog floating somewhere in space. All we can know is what comes in through the eyes, ears, mind and body in the present moment. Regarding a not so permanent self, you find impermanence in every moment... the Buddha's no-self teaching goes something like this: A soul is not to be found in any practice the Buddha teaches but he didn't necessarily say that there was no soul at all and it is important not to ponder it too much but instead try to understand you and what's the center of you by practicing some kind of meditation that will give you insights into yourself like Zazen or Satipatthana Vipassana. 

How about The Bhante Yuttadhammo channel on YouTube? He has a lot of useful videos but check out "How to Meditate" for beginners. His online videos are beginner to intermediate on much more than only mindfulness and he gives meditation courses from beginner to advanced. The teachers below teach about the same way as Bhante Yuttadhammo and are very beginner friendly: Joseph Goldstein, Bhante Bodhidhamma, Gil Fronsdal Just Google one of the above names in quotes and add "Dhamma talks" There's a Youtuber called "Stephen Proctor" who gives outstanding beginning teachings on mindfulness meditation in my opinion. Has anyone else heard of him? Is it just me or can this guy really teach or what? These teachers practice the same way I try to practice but there are a lot of good teachers who might have a different approach. 

I'm not a Pali scholar but "wrong" sounds like a wrong translation. It is "something that leads one to suffering" to believe that the self exists, or that it doesn't? The view or belief that there is a self is the most fundemental idea that leads beings to suffering on an individual scale and is the separator of us all. 

When practicing metta on anyone we can focus on what is good in the person. If nothing good can be found then maybe compassion would work. When we cause suffering, we suffer ourselves and we can be compassionate to those that suffer by causing suffering. Compassion is a good replacement for any anger we might have for "the wicked". Ultimately we practice metta for ourselves and not so much for the other person because when we help others, we help ourselves. 

Stop trying to control is a good way to gain some control(: Insight meditation(I assume your talking about insight so if your practicing something else than this answer probably doesn't apply) is so easy in a way because the only thing you ultimatly have to do is experience what is going on in your own experience. Although it's good to do preliminary stuff like doing good sila so that the mind can better become clear and concentrated and making sure the facilities are ballanced. In insight meditation there are ways to control your own faculties but it's better to find a good teacher. They will know how to guide you so your practice is effective. -Good luck 

Does anyone know if one can fall asleep into a dream while in the process of mindful insight practice and still maintain mindfulness and concentration? This would be different than establishing mindfulness while dreaming. 

Certain subjects are declared to be imponderable by the Buddha: 1) range of powers of a Buddha 2) range of powers obtained while absorbed in jhana 3) precise working out of the results of karma 4) speculation about the origin (the first moment, purpose, etc.) of the cosmos The -origin of matter- question seems like it probably is the fourth imponderable.* WHY TEACHERS WON'T ANSWER QUESTIONS Beginning meditators start with simple concepts but too often we want to leap ahead and open the Christmas presents before Christmas, so to speak. Wrong view in the path is like when the meditator believes they already understand "Sila" and "Dana" and what seems most useful , to this certain student, is to learn the juicy bits... the exotic stuff, like anatta and Dependant Origination. This is a wrong view festival. The reason why teachers don't explain certain advanced concepts is because most likely an intellectual understanding leaves too much room for interpretation so that there is too much danger that the student will develop wrong view. Your mindful experience is what will teach you. If you are a practicioner, it's best to get a good teacher that can really give you the right information at the right time that you need it. 

In the mind and body at the level of experiencing things moment by moment there is feeling and tiredness but nothing feels hungry or gets tired that can be experienced directly. 

Your doubting just Buddhism in the 2nd part of the question. Buddhism and The Buddha's teaching aren't necessarily the same thing. It Isn't the Buddha's fault that there was a schism. If I were you I would look to the Buddha's actual core teachings for verification. He repeated these core teachings over and over again. These core teachings are solid and beautiful the way they are fashioned. All the concepts fit together in a simple, clear, graceful, wise, subtle and serious way imho. When one see's this grace of the Dhamma, it's hard to doubt. 

You can put your hand on your abdomen at first. After awhile you could probably spot the sensation without the hand. You could lay down on your back and put your hand on your stomach for a stronger view of the rise and fall. You could make your anchor focus on the sensation of your bottom and legs making contact with the floor or cushion instead of the abdomen. Hope this helps :) Metta 

We all do things that are bad until we don't. You want kids but your worried about your previous karma effecting your current life. If your worried about it then here's what might work: Do selfless work for other babies and parents. This might help. Helping other people helps you. Practice Metta and compassion for all including yourself. There is also forgiveness meditation: 

Know that they are only actors and don't watch it if it's going to traumatize you. Don't watch any movies unless you like distraction. 

I don't think there is any sutta in the Tipitaka that the Lotus Sutra originates from. From a strictly old monk Theravada viewpoint, the Lotus Sutra is inauthentic because they don't think it was spoken by the Buddha...but I don't see how the old monk traditional Theravada could fully understand another tradition enough to decide how the tradition interprets what was spoken by the Buddha. 

Why is a lie for the purposes of self defence necessarily unwholesome? Why is using a lie as defence for another from attack considered parajeeka for a monk when a monk can use physical self defence and it's not parajeeka? Why can't a monk misrepresent reality(lie) for self defense instead of resorting to physical violence? As long as you know what the truth is why give it to someone who would exploit it? I was thinking that our intentions aren't unwholesome because we lie but a lie is unwholesome because of our unwholesome intentions. -Metta
