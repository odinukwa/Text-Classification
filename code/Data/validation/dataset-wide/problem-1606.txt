This manual appears to be an authentic manual published by the Mexican government. A translation of its contents can be found here (American source) and here (Mexican source). The pamphlet does appear to describe methods to illegally immigrate to the US and methods to avoid getting arrested once in the US, although it nominally discourages such action. That being said, the manual is rather scanty on details, and mainly consists of (very) general ideas on what to avoid in order to reduce the risk of death. Therefore, it seems that the manual was chiefly intended as a method to reduce death rather than as a method to export migrants. A copy of the manual was created by the right wing organisation CFIF, which cited the original address of the manual on the Mexican government webpage. This page has since been taken down. The Wayback Machine has however archived their information, and it can be viewed there. Therefore, we can conclude that the Mexican government did in fact publish such a pamphlet, at least on their website. Given such a fact, it is not a stretch to conclude that they also published the pamphlet in hard copy, although I have no better sources than the NY Times article for this claim. 

Of course, correlation does not imply causation. Therefore, research has been done to associate the hygiene hypothesis on the molecular and cell biology levels. On the molecular/cell biology viewpoint, it has also been shown that reduced exposure to bacterial endotoxins (a product of bacteria) was correlated an increase in hay fever and other autoimmune diseases. 

Considering that a wide range of subject matter experts such as police officers and civil rights commissioners have not heard of any such incidents across the country despite the highly inflammatory and newsworthy nature of any such events, it is highly likely that no cases of sexual assault by transgendered individuals in public restrooms have ever occurred. 

NTT DoCoMo (the largest Japanese telecom company)'s customer service department recently tweeted an image purportedly showing the harmful effects of overusing smartphones: 

Many online sources report on the Indian teenager Deepak Jangra (Daily Mail, Mirror) who claims to be able to resist 11kV electric shocks. They include images of him touching an exposed mains wire powering a lightbulb to his tongue, and also claimed that he touched the 11kV live wire powering the village without any negative effects. 

Personally, I prefer to use Chinese for mental calculations for exactly this reason, despite being more fluent in English. Therefore, it is likely that the number system pronunciation has some effect on at least one part (the mental storage and recall of numbers) of math performance. 

This thread on the Snopes forums also makes a similar claim. Are there any reliable sources that show the Chihuahua dog breed was frequently eaten by the Mesoamericans? 

The BBC and the New York Times report that the a field of Golden Rice GMO rice was vandalised by Philippine farmers: 

Snopes has weighed in with some opinions, but they are mainly based on the same partial sources. Can anyone find a better primary source on this issue? 

I was linked to this article on Global Research.ca today which claims that GMO companies (specifically Monsanto, but also naming DuPont and Syngenta) ban independent research on their seeds. 

The GIF was sourced from the International Space Station video by astronaut Don Pettit. The video depicts small water droplets orbiting a polyethylene knitting needle which was charged by rubbing it with a piece of paper. Don Petitt states that the blue knitting needles are "8mm in diameter". In the video, Don Pettit clearly says that the attractions are electrostatic, and not gravitational in nature. A transcript of the relevant section for those who can't watch the video (starting around 0:50, emphasis mine) 

However, the more respectable etymology source Online Etymology Dictionary disagrees with this etymology: 

To me, at least, the photo looks suspiciously doctored, and I was not aware of any reason why the relatively light weight of a smartphone can cause such a deformity. The Google Translate of the tweet information: 

No, only the first claim appears to be accurate as far as we can determine. The biotech startup appears to be the company Pembient, which is based in San Francisco. According to Tech Crunch, Pembient has successfully printed a horn prototype, which was shown to the reporter. 

Yes, it is to a large extent. This paper by Lian et al. explores the formation of volatile chlorinated compounds that are formed from reactions with organic nitrogen compounds, such as urea, amino acids, uric acid and creatinine. The authors exposed both dilute solutions of uric acid and bodily fluid analogs (mixtures of compounds intended to mimic the composition of bodily fluids such as sweat and urine) to the sodium hypochlorite disinfectant used in swimming pools. They showed by mass spectroscopy that uric acid, when exposed to sodium hypochlorite, forms the toxic compounds cyanogen chloride and trichloroamine, and the bodily fluid analogs also produce similar levels of these chemicals when exposed to sodium hypochlorite. 

Ironically, searching Google itself does not turn up any useful evidence that this statement is true. Is the claim by Google true? 

The organisation Planting Peace recently put up a billboard in controversial county clerk Kim Davis' hometown: 

However, the reason that renewable energy had temporarily negative prices is that it is difficult to store energy, and that only a limited proportion of excess energy can be exported due to transmission capacity constraints. Power has to be used as it is generated, and many power plants cannot be stopped temporarily without large losses to efficiency and incurring significant costs. In those cases, the power plant operator may choose to pay for power to be consumed, in order to not have to temporarily shut their power plants down. The EU commission document explains this: 

Was marriage ever defined in the Bible or other religious texts as "selling your daughter for three goats and a cow" or an equivalent phrase? 

This unsourced Reddit comment also asserts that he could not find citations that Edison actually scammed Tesla while making that quote. 

Is such a product actually sold commercially for profit in India, or is this merely a joke/hoax/photoshop? 

The authors then refute the conclusion made by the anti-homosexual links, by statistically defining what their conclusions are, and how "gays are bad" is not a valid conclusion to draw from the paper: 

I have been seeing many reports of people claiming that a French Muslim security guard named "Zouheir" stopped a suicide bomber from entering the stadium where a Germany vs France football match was being played. For example, this Facebook post as a response to the BBC's news report claimed the following: 

Is it true that roosters let their hens eat first, as opposed to the behaviour of male lions, which eat the prey (often caught by the lionesses) first? 

Many websites make the claim that Albert Einstein never learned to drive. For example, this website claims: 

Native Japanese speakers are welcome to suggest edits and/or provide a proper translation, but it seems quite clear (to a Chinese speaker) that they are suggesting that the finger deformity is caused by holding the smartphone. The belief of "smartphone pinky" being a real phenomenon is also corroborated by Rocket News 24 (an English blog about Japan) which cites the above Twitter post, as well as Urban Dictionary, which attests that the deformation is permanent. 

This YouTube video with over 100,000 views makes the claim that the BBC faked the iguana-snake chase scene in its recent documentary, Planet Earth 2. It makes the claim that the bundle of snakes was produced by CGI, and that real and fake videos were composited together in order to produce the final video. It then cites a list of news articles showing that the BBC has used custom-built sets to film its wildlife documentaries under controlled conditions, most notably in its documentary Frozen Planet. Is there any reliable evidence that the BBC has used any CGI or image composition in the snake-iguana chase scene of Planet Earth 2? 

It is likely that the claim is due to a misunderstanding, since extrapolating the tree planting rate from 2009 to 2016 would in fact result in approximately 70 billion trees. Other sources such as The Economist also report that China has planted 66 billion trees since 1978 and not 2003, as claimed. 

There are multiple online sources that claim the Chihuahua dog breed was often eaten by the Mesoamerican cultures who lived there before the arrival of the Europeans. For example, this site claims that: 

As can be seen in the graph, roughly 0.6 billion hectares of forest has been lost over the past century, from 1900 (1.2 billion hectares lost) to 2010 (1.8 billion hectares lost). Therefore, the total forest cover has decreased by approximately 13% in the past century, which hardly reaches the level claimed. Unless the forests cut down are almost 4 times denser per unit area than the average forest, it is also unlikely that half of the total number of trees was cut down. 

The UN Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO)'s forest report State of the Worldâ€™s Forests states that forests cover 4 billion hectares of the Earth's surface: 

This data shows that engineering professors were in fact less religious than social scientists, in contradiction of the book cited. 

The introduction of lipoproteins found in bacterial cell walls into mice was also shown to reduce inflammation caused by allergic asthma in mice. 

They also showed that physically adding uric acid (simulating urination) into actual samples of pool water caused the levels of cyanogen chloride and trichloroamine to increase: 

None of these cases occurred near the time period cited. Therefore, while I cannot show conclusively what the Chinese government's bullet fee policy was during the 1989 protests, there are records of them charging a bullet fee for execution by firing squad before and after that period. 

This Media Matters article discusses the topic of transgendered individuals (or non-transgendered individuals pretending to be one) committing sexual assaults in public restrooms. They interviewed a number of experts on the topic, and none of them were aware of any case of such sexual assaults occurring. A selection of the interviews are listed below: 

Is it true that Monsanto and other GMO companies forbid independent testing of their seeds? I am skeptical of this claim because "seed piracy" can already be defended against by existing copyright/patent laws, and it seems counterproductive to ban independent research when it bolsters the cause of GMO as a whole. 

Their yearly reports clearly show that Sunni terrorists make up an absolute majority of deaths caused. The majority holds for all of the individual years that were available on the archives. For example, this is the deaths breakdown by perpetrator group for the year 2008: 

A reporter from Myanmar Times (the newspaper involved in the scandal referred to in the Guardian article) has written another article (again in English) about the scandal: In it, she agrees with the Guardian claim that the polite word for the vagina translates to "woman's body", and that other regional languages do not possess similar taboos for the word. 

A later comment in the same thread claims that it was not Edison, but a manager at the company who made that statement. 

A video of the incident was also linked to, but I was unable to hear anything other than the whistling and vague chanting (which did not sound like "Allahu akbar".) Did the Turkish football fans at the match chant "Allahu akbar" in any significant unison during the moment of silence? 

However, in a later interview with The Guardian, Pembient admitted that the horn was produced not with rhino keratin, but in fact with wool keratin, which is not genetically identical to rhino horns. There is no publicly available evidence that Pembient has in fact produced horns made with rhino keratin. 

However, both sources have reported different reasons the car was sent flying. The Daily Mail claims it was a roadside bomb, while Independent claims it was a landmine. Is this video genuine, and does it show an ISIS car bomb as reported? 

There are many sources on the internet which claim that prairie dogs can be exterminated using bubblegum: Source 1: 

However, the Daily Mail article on the same event makes a completely different claim, that Zouheir did not stop the terrorist himself, but that he was stationed inside the stadium, and that another member of the team of guards, not Zouheir, was to credit for catching the suicide bomber and preventing him from entering the stadium. 

The source cited in the article comment (which has a anti-homosexual slant) references this article, which does in fact show that the life expectancy of gays and bisexuals in Vancouver in 1996 was 8-20 years shorter than all men (note the large confidence interval). The article was intended to show the effects of HIV on the life expectancy of gay men. One notable factor was the relative difficulty of getting HIV treatment in a timeframe when being homosexual was still considered socially unacceptable, resulting in the high death rates measured. 

This article from Time Motto makes the claim that sleep deprivation will result in faster death than starvation. 

I saw this advertisement posted on the way to work today, and it made the claim that people make "about 35000 decisions a day". 

No, China has planted approximately 66 billion trees since 1978. According to the UN Forum on Forests report dated 2010, China has planted 56.33 billion trees from 1978 to 2009, with 2.48 billion trees being planted in 2009 alone.
