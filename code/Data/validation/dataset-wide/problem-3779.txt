I will now explain some of the above claims. First, by a computation modulo $4$, note that $x$ is odd and $y$ is even. Put $P = \prod_{b_i=1} p_i$ and $Q = \prod_{b_i=0} p_i$, so $D=PQ$. So $x \equiv -1 \bmod P$ and $x \equiv 1 \bmod Q$. We have $$\left( \frac{x+1}{2P} \right) \left( \frac{x-1}{2 Q} \right) = \left( \frac{y}{2} \right)^2$$ where all factors are integers. The factors on the left are relatively prime, since $$P \left( \frac{x+1}{2P} \right) - Q \left( \frac{x-1}{2 Q} \right)=1.$$ So $(x+1)/(2P)=u^2$ and $(x-1)/(2Q)=v^2$ for some $u$ and $v$. We deduce that $$P u^2 - Q v^2 = 1. \quad (\ast)$$ We can now see that $b \neq 0$: If $b=0$ then $P=1$ and $Q=D$, so $(\ast)$ contradicts the minimality of $(x,y)$. We now check that $Ab=0$, by computing each coordinate $\sum_j A_{ij} b_j$ of $Ab$. Case 1 $b_i=0$. Then $p_i$ divides $Q$ and, reducing $(\ast)$ modulo $p_i$, we see that $\prod_{b_j=1} p_j$ is square modulo $p_i$. This exactly says that $\sum_{j} A_{ij} b_j=0$. Case 2 $b_i=1$. As above, we deduce that $\prod_{b_j=0} p_j$ is square modulo $p_i$, so $\sum_{j \neq i} A_{ij} (1-b_j)=0$. But this is $\sum_{j \neq i} A_{ij} + \sum_{j \neq i} A_{ij} b_j = A_{ii} + \sum_{j \neq i} A_{ij} b_j = \sum_j A_{ij} b_j$, where the first equality is because the rows of $A$ sum to $0$. Finally, note that, if $b=(1,1,\cdots, 1)$, then $(\ast)$ says that the negative Pell's equation is solvable. Conversely, if the negative Pell's equation is solvable with solution $v^2-D u^2 = -1$, then $(x,y) = (v^2+Du^2, 2 uv)$ is the minimal solution to $x^2-Dy^2=1$ and, sure enough, $x \equiv v^2 \equiv -1 \bmod D$. 

I'm afraid I don't understand cut elimination, but Will Sawin suggests above that this is also an answer to your main question. 

If the eigenvalues of $M$ are $\lambda_1$, $\lambda_2$, ..., $\lambda_n$, then the minimum is $n (\lambda_1 \cdots \lambda_n)^{1/n}$. Proof: Your problem is invariant under conjugating $X$ and $M$ by a unitary matrix. So we may assume that $M$ is diagonal, with diagonal entries $\lambda_1$, ..., $\lambda_n$. Once we have made this assumption, we have $\mathrm{Tr}(XM) = \sum x_{ii} \lambda_i$. In other words, this is a linear function of the diagonal of $X$. We temporarily restrict ourselves to looking at those $X$ whose eigenvalues are $\mu_1$, $\mu_2$, ..., $\mu_n$. The space of positive definite matrices $X$ with eigenvalues $\mu_1$, $\mu_2$, ..., $\mu_n$ is a compact manifold. The Schur-Horn theorem states: 

Let's be more explicit. Let $k^N$ have orthonormal basis $e_1$, \ldots, $e_n$. Let $L$ be a $d$-plane with Plucker coordinates $p_I$. Let $q_J$ be the Plucker coordinates of $L^{\perp}$. Then $p_I = \pm q_{[n] \setminus I}$, where I am too lazy to work out the sign. In particular, this is a well defined morphism, not just a rational map. Here $[k]$ denotes $\{1,2,\ldots, k \}$. This is probably more easily done by an example than a proof. Let's look at the $2$-plane in $5$-space given as the row span of $$\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & a & b & c \\ 0 & 1 & d & e & f \end{pmatrix}$$ Its Plucker coordinates are $$p_{12} =1,\ p_{13} = d,\ p_{14}=e,\ p_{15}=f,\ p_{23}=-a,\ p_{24} = -b,\ p_{25} = -c,$$ $$\ p_{34} = ae-bd,\ p_{35} = af-cd,\ p_{45} = bf-ce.$$ The orthogonal complement is $$\begin{pmatrix} a & d & -1 & 0 & 0 \\ b & e & 0 & -1 & 0 \\ c & f & 0 & 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}.$$ (Check it for yourself!) The Plucker coordinates of this matrix are $$q_{345} = -1,\ q_{245} = d,\ q_{235} = -e,\ q_{234}=f,\ q_{145} = a,\ q_{135}=-b,\ q_{134} = c$$ $$q_{125} = - (ae-bd),\ q_{124} = af-cd,\ q_{123} = - (bf-ce).$$ It should be pretty clear how to redraw this example for a larger Grassmannian, up to getting the sign details right. 

I'm not sure if this is "MO level" but, as proof that it is "confuse a good mathematician level", see this conversation between Ravi Vakil and Allen Knutson. 

This is a pretty standard graph theory lemma but, if you haven't seen it before, you haven't seen it before: Theorem There are no planar graphs where every face is a disc with $\geq 6$ sides and each vertex has degree $\geq 3$. Proof Let $F_k$ be the number of faces with $k$ sides and $V_m$ the number of vertices of degree $m$. Writing $(V, E, F)$ for the total number of vertices, edges and faces, we have $$E = \frac{1}{2} \sum_k k F_k = \frac{1}{2} \sum_m m V_m$$ and hence $$E = \sum_k \frac{k}{6} F_k + \sum_m \frac{m}{3} V_m.$$ Plugging into Euler's $F+V-E=2$, we get that $$\sum_k \frac{6-k}{6} F_k + \sum_m \frac{3-m}{3} V_m = 2.$$ So either there is a vertex of degree $<3$ or a face of size $<6$. $\square$ Remark If you allow vertices of degree $2$, such examples exist topologically: Take a tetrahedron and put a vertex in the middle of each edge. Remark More generally, if $1/p+1/q \geq 1/2$, a similar argument shows that there is either a vertex of degree $\geq p$ or a face of degree $\geq 3$. The interesting cases are $(p,q) = (3,6)$, $(4,4)$ and $(6,3)$. 

This answer is basically a longer version of Felipe Voloch's, but maybe it will be useful. Both proofs take a class in $H^1(E)$, pull it back to $H^1(\mathbb{P}^1)$ and note that $H^1(\mathbb{P}^1)$ is zero to conclude that the map $\mathbb{P}^1 \to E$ was constant. The difference is what form of $H^1$ we work with. The topological version is that a continuous map from a sphere to a torus must have degree zero; then holomorphic maps of degree zero are constant. Proof with differentials We take the class $dy/x$ in $H^0(E, \Omega^1)$ and pull it back to $H^0(\mathbb{P}^1, \Omega^1)=0$. This gives some equations on derivatives which imply that we are pulling back by the zero map. By Hodge theory, for any curve $X$, the sheaf cohomology $H^0(X, \Omega^1)$ is half of $H^1(X, \mathbb{C})$. The proof by descent The map $$ \phi(x:y:z) = (x+\omega y + \omega^2 z : x+\omega^2 y + \omega z : - 3 x y z)$$ is a degree $3$ unbranched cover of $E$, giving a class in $H^1(E, \mathbb{Z}/3)$. If we pull this cover back to $\mathbb{P}^1$, then it must become trivial. Your computations are explicitly showing that, if $a(t)^3+b(t)^3+c(t)^3=0$, then we can find some $x(t)$, $y(t)$, $z(t)$ such that $(a:b:c)=\phi(x:y:z)$. So you have shown that this $\mathbb{Z}/3$ cover has a section, and is thus trivial. Abstractly, the reason there must be a section is that $H^1(\mathbb{P}^1, \mathbb{Z}/3)=0$. Here is an abstract proof that $H^1(\mathbb{P}^1, \mathbb{Z}/3)=0$. Look at the short exact sequence $1 \to \mu_3 \to \mathcal{O}^{\ast} \to \mathcal{O}^{\ast} \to 1$, where $\mu_3$ is the group of cube roots of unity, $\mathcal{O}^{\ast}$ is the sheaf of nonvanishing holomorphic functions and the second map is cubing. (The topology is either analytic or etale.) Looking at the long exact sequence in cohomology, we see that $H^1(\mathbb{P}^1, \mu_3)$ is the $3$-torsion in $Pic(\mathbb{P}^1)$. But $\mathbb{C}[t]$ is a PID, so $Pic(\mathbb{A}^1)=0$ and $Pic(\mathbb{P}^1) \cong \mathbb{Z}$. You wind up using the exact same fact -- that $\mathbb{C}[t]$ is a PID -- when you write down the proof in an elementary way. I remark that the first proof using a "de Rham" description of $H^1$ (by differential forms) and the second proof uses a "Betti" description (by covering maps). Relating de Rham and Betti descriptions is always complicated. 

I believe I have a counter-example in $p$-groups. I'm hoping someone who really knows non-commutative deformation theory can fill in the last half. $\def\FF\mathbb{F}$Write $\FF_q$ for the field with $q$ elements. Let $p$ be an odd prime. I first present my two groups, $G_1$ and $G_2$. For $i=1$, $2$, fix a short exact sequence $0 \to Z_i \to W_i \to V_i \to 0$ of $\FF_p$ vector spaces, with $\dim Z_i = 2$, $\dim V_i = 4$. We write $w \mapsto \overline{w}$ for the quotient map $W_i \to V_i$. Let $\phi_i : \bigwedge^2 V_i \to Z_i$ be a linear map. We extend $\phi_i$ to a map $W_i \times W_i \to Z_i$ by $(w,w') \mapsto \phi_i(\overline{w} \wedge \overline{w})$, and denote this map by $\phi_i$ as well. The underlying set of $G_i$ will be $W$. Given an element $w$ in $W_i$, we write $a^w$ for the corresponding element of $G_i$. The relations in $G_i$ are 

I'm hoping someone will check this computation. I get that the Bott-Samelson over $SL_3/B$ is not homeomorphic to $(\mathbb{P}^1)^3$. That is a major obstacle for the approach that Allen and VA discuss above. There are two reduced words for the longest element of $S_3$, but the automorphism of the Dynkin diagram exchanges them. So, as an abstract variety, it makes sense to talk about the Bott-Samelson for $SL_3$. We'll call it $X$. Let $F$ be $\mathbb{P}^2$ blown up at a point, with $\pi: F \to \mathbb{P}^2$ the blowdown. Then $X$ is a $\mathbb{P}^1$ bundle over $F$. Specifically, let $Q$ be the tautological quotient over $\mathbb{P}^2$. I believe that $X$ is $\mathbb{P}(\pi^* Q)$. Let's compute $H^*(X)$. Everything is in even degree. $H^*(\mathbb{P}^2) = \mathbb{Z}[H]/H^3$, where $H$ is the hyperplane class. The blowup $F$ has $H^*(F) = \mathbb{Z}[H,E]/\langle H^2+E^2,\ HE \rangle$ where $E$ is the class of the exceptional fiber. The chern class of $Q$ is $1+H+H^2$. So $$H^(X) = H^*(F)[Z]/\langle Z^2 + ZH + H^2 \rangle = \mathbb{Z}[H,E,Z]/\langle H^2+E^2,\ HE,\ Z^2+ZH+H^2 \rangle.$$ So $H^2(X)$ is three dimensional. We have a cubic form on $H^2(X)$ given by $\alpha \mapsto \int_X \alpha^3$. I get that this cubic form is $$\int_X \begin{pmatrix} Z^3 & & & \\ Z^2 H & Z^2 E & & \\ Z H^2 & ZHE & Z E^2 & \\ H^3 & H^2 E & H E^2 & E^3 \end{pmatrix}= \begin{pmatrix} 0 & & & \\ 1 & 0 & & \\ -1 & 0 & 1 & \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$$ Of course, the corresponding matrix for $(\mathbb{P}^1)^3$ is $$\begin{pmatrix} 0 & & & \\ 0 & 0 & & \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$$ Now, if there were a homeomorphism $X \cong (\mathbb{P}^1)^3$, then there would be an isomorphism $ H^2(X) \otimes \mathbb{C} \cong H^2((\mathbb{P}^1)^3) \otimes \mathbb{C}$ taking one cubic to the other. But I get that the first cubic is a line times a conic, while the second is three lines.
