I use a Garmin Forerunner 235 which has these features. The heart rate monitor is built into the back of the watch, rather than using a chest strap which I think the Polar model does. It can also connect to bike speed/cadence sensors, your smart phone etc. A dedicated bike computer like the Garmin Edge 810 is also useful as it adds a map display and route planning. 

The traditional 53/39 is basically what a pro would use, it's for speed as the top priority. Even some pros are using compact cranksets to help with climbing. 50/34 is the the normal next step down, but 46/30 just makes it easier again. Only drawback is that when shifting down to the small chain ring, the chain can come off. But a good derailleur should prevent this. 

Bicycles do have dynamo powered lights, which are pedal powered. They used to have a small generator that was rotated by the tyre. But this has been replaced by 'dynanmo hubs', with the generator being attached to the wheel hub. This basically means getting a wheel buildt around the hub or buying a wheel which has this type of hub, which would be fairly expensive. The one dynamo can power both front and back lights. Rear lights don't need to put out as much power as front ones. The batteries should last for several months of normal use in blink or flashing mode. For the front lights you may want to look at a better quality one that has several brightness settings. But you wont get much more than 6 hours burn time from them. Keeping a spare set of charged up batteries can help. 

I snagged the wire on my Cateye Mity 8 computer on the rack the other day and broke it mid wire. I'm going to fix it by splicing them back together. I'm worried about effects of getting the wires crossed. I'm going to take some care not to cross them, but if I do, will it cause problems? What readings should I get from it with a multi-meter? 

I went with the original integrated covers on my hubs without the pressed on caps on the cones. To remove the caps from the cones I just used a sock to sit on the dust cap and give it a good whack with a hammer and it came right off. If my new cones ever do come with a large enough cover then I would probably go with that. 

EDIT Not to take away on the answers here. My daughter has been riding this bike like this for just under a year now. She has even taken it off a simple 2x4 and plywood ramp without issue. I'm sure it will handle most kids, but since she is on the small side then I can't really answer as such. 

They should be safe to ride. For comparison, your tire is is 37mm wide. Schwable makes a Marathon Winter tire in 35mm and 42mm for a 700c tire so the width isn't an issue. The only problem you will have is soft snow where the studs don't help. If your tire doesn't have a more aggressive tread pattern then you may still have traction issues. 

These trailer hitches are interchangeable and I have no issues. I'm using the round connector in the square tube since it physically fits. I have put some miles on it on it hauling kids bikes, pulling kids in sleds (recommended to keep the rope out of the tire and carry a spotter), and a 90 mile weekend camping trip. I have had no issues with it. As a bonus here I took a round connector out of another trailer that really has some miles and years on and put it on a new trailer (Trek branded Chariot). The tongue was squared tubed and too small for the connector but I was able to take a stone grinding wheel to the connector and re-size and shape to get it to fit. No issues found in it at all. 

Hard to be definitive. But I thought it started with Gary Fisher and others on cruiser bikes with coaster brakes $URL$ the Repack Races. He went on to develop the first mountain bikes. 

I have an aluminium bike with a rubber dampener built into the handle bar, it's part of Specializeds range, not sure if there are general versions. A suspension fork would iron out more bumps than a carbon one, but may not fit your bike. I've taken videos from a handlebar mounted camera too and I think there will always be a lot of jolting that is impossible to dampen. Low light will make this worse. I think the best answer is to use a helmet mounted cam, so the suspension system is your body and neck. I've seen some fantastic videos of the New York alley cat races and they all use helmet cams. They also need strong necks! How much image stabilization can your camera provide? 

From $URL$ it looks like it could have been made form 1957 to 1961 or later. It looks like it has a 3 speed internal hub gearbox, probably a Sturmy Archer, as it is British made. Appears that Armstrong was part of a larger group by this stage, and the ealier design approach may have changed a lot. If you look under where the pedals are (the bottom bracket), there is often a serial number which may contain the year of manufacturer. Or it could be stamped elsewhere on the frame. 

Yes, at least one strand has broken. Looks like this happened where the cable was previously under the fastening bolt. Since then, the cable has been let out, maybe to allow for new brake pads? It would probably last a while before more strands break. But a new cable is only around $5. It's very important to be able to stop your bike reliably, so I would definitely replace it now. It's an easy change to make, cables ends normally slot in fairly easily to the brake levers on V-brakes. 

My hubs have a integrated dust cover which consists of a rubber diaphragm that is pressed into the end of the hub and has a opening for the cone: 

Generally, when we put a saddle clamp on we put it so the rails are mounted on the "top" side (reference clamp pictured): 

I have a set of Continental Touring tires with the white reflective stripe on the sidewalls, and they get pretty dirty with road and brake grime. Normally I would clean with car soap and water but sometimes it doesn't get all the dirt off/make them look new. It is also winter right now so it is harder to soap and water wash in the garage. I did use a washcloth and clear water from bucket. It helped a lot but still a long ways off. Is there a way that I can make the stripe clean and bright white again? NOTE: The reflective strip on these tires are a tape that is added to the tire. I have another bike with different brand tires where they might be painted on. 

I just used the regular Polylube they sell when putting them back together since it was all I had. Wheelbearings are really easy to find online as well. Then replace any consumables (tires, brake pads). If this bike isn't doing any dirt, you can find 16 inch street tires as well. Even on bikes that small, they make a huge difference. You can look at brake cables, and chain as well, but they are a replace as needed thing. 

This is not common in America. Perhaps in Europe in places where cycling is more common, but I'm going to say it is going to go the opposite way: going to higher gearing to get the kid going faster, or even to go to lower gearing to if they have trouble getting them going. As for America, we don't really buy kids bikes with specific gearing. It is something that isn't advertised for the bike (unless that is the major selling point of the bike). Many of the 1 piece cranks we have are not capable of swapping chain rings. However, the rear hubs still use the common 3 spline interface for single speed cogs. I have swapped out the rear cog on a kids bike that we used for mountain bike trails because the gearing was too high for the kid. However, despite the popularity of mountain biking in my are, my kids seem to be the only ones doing it on a 16" bike. 

You can buy 30 meter rolls of cable housing such as $URL$ . I would opt for Shimano or Transfil, as have seen problems with the much cheaper Clarkes. Brake cable housings have a completely different construction to shifters. The housing is a coiled sheath , compared to the axial strands in shifter housing. And brake housing is larger diameter. So different housing for different purposes. 

Most people go the other way. Many new bikes now only come with double chain rings. And compact crank sets give almost the same gear range as triples. But it should be possible. The distance the front derailleur travels is about the same. You may need to adjust your limit screws though. And of course you need to change the front shifter to a 3 speed version. 

Racing is all about speed. 25mm tyres have a larger contact area so there is more rolling resistance than a 23mm. It doesn't make a huge difference but it is significant. You wouldn't be competitive on 25s with everyone else runnings 23s. But for some very tough terrain, such as going over cobblestones, most teams will often run 25s front and back. They also deflate slightly from the maximum pressure to avoid some of the ride harshness. I started on 28mm tyres on a commuter and soon went down to 23mm. Didn't notice any difference in tyre wear or comfort. Bike was less effort to ride. Only downside is is that it is more likely to catch a rut in the road, but you ride with a bit more caution. 

If you are prepared to move down to the SRAM Apex model, you can still get a 50/34 172.5mm version $URL$ The first question and answer here indicates that an 11 spped chainring will work with a 10 speed chain: $URL$ 

Assuming that the wheel will fit in the drops, will a rear wheel (minus the freewheel/cassette) work for a front wheel? What kind of problems could this present? I happen to have a spare back wheel for my bike (without the freewheel on it) and wonder could I if my front gets totaled. 

Yes, you can replace it. Although you might have to goto another brands system, and a little hacking. Personally, every trailer I have I use the Burley Flex Connector system ($URL$ What ever you go with though you may have to get a few other parts for it to all work. In the Burley case, the hitch for your bike ($URL$ Here is the similar piece for the Burley flex connector system, and how it works on my bike: 

The cones on the new axle have dust covers on them (the old ones did not), but the opening on the hub is larger than most I presume: 

I'm asking this for my kids 16" bike. She fits the bike well, but has a little issue of getting up on the saddle. There appears to be enough space in the saddle to flip the clamp. She is on the petite side at 15kg (and for reference, same model bike, my son was 23kg when he retired it). I do plan on flipping it back over before I extend the seat post though. Does this work or will I run into issues? I went ahead and did it, it was just right amount she needed, didn't even mess with the lock on the rack. 

As far as lubricant in the bottom bracket and the wheel hubs, it depends what grease was used, age of it, and the temperature outside. I have bikes, with stock grease in the hubs roll really well through all temperatures (-17c to 38) and all ages. However, I do have a Trek bike for my son (20" MT-60) and when the temperature approached freezing, the wheel hubs and bottom bracket became very stiff and didn't roll well at all. I was only getting a few turns of the wheel even after vigorous pedaling in my work stand. I ended up repacking the bearings with the common green stuff in the blue tube and it was a instant improvement. Repacking only applies though if there is serious drag in them to begin with, and using proven grease.
