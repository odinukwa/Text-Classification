While I suppose this may vary from country to country, everywhere I know of that employers withhold tax, they send it regularly to the government. For example here in Canada, I pay my staff twice a month. Once a month I must send these "withholdings" - tax, employment insurance, government pension - to the government. (I can "kite" a little by paying someone their net pay on the 15th and not having to send the withholding to the government for a few more weeks, but that's all.) I have other "withholdings" that are not tax, such as paying premiums on private health insurance, and I use these to pay those bills each month. I'm sure it's the same for your employer. Also, here, if I withhold $1000 from you for the government and don't send it to them, that doesn't matter to you. Once I've told them (on your T4 tax slip that summarizes your income) that I withheld it for you, you get credit for it even if I fail to ever send it in. As a result, you don't really need o know what your employer does with it. 

Make it as smooth and easy as possible for your manager to give the go-ahead. If the deadline is a week or more after the manager returns, just leave it and discuss it a day or two after the return, allowing some time for dealing with urgent things. If the deadline is while your manager is still away, take a look at that out of office mail (or go by what your manager told you when announcing the vacation) to see if there's someone else who could approve the request. But it probably won't be. 

I run a family business that has employed my children. We are all on a first name basis, so both staff and children would occasionally say "Kate" to each other when referring to me. The kids might say "mum" to someone, no worries. Some of my staff had been with me a long time, their kids were friends with my kids etc, these are the ones more likely to say "your mum" to one of my children. It never once mattered to me a speck. Note: the largest this company ever got was 11 people. I might have a different answer for a team of hundreds, or when the parent didn't own the company. But for a small cohesive group, where everyone knows the relationships, and many staff have known us for decades (I had a young programmer for a summer job who I first met when he was 4, and have twice employed people who lived close enough to my house to walk to work when the office was attached to the house) it doesn't matter what you call me, everyone knows who I am. 

Do not reply. The mistake is done and made and apologized for. You've admitted both to making a mistake and to it being a silly one. He's not calling you out in front of others, so his email changes nothing: it doesn't give you new information nor impose a new obligation on you. File it or delete it. Generally when someone tells me that their child or younger sibling or whatever wouldn't do such a thing as I did, I know they are very unhappy with me. I can't correct that by words, only by actions. "Standing up for yourself" won't change a thing. Let it go. Try to make less mistakes in the future. 

First, "call the manager out?" To whom? What will be the consequences? Will you be awarded compensation, or a letter of apology? Of course not. I find it hard to believe you have something valuable enough they could ask for it repeatedly, and would just say "hey, I have no car or money for buses, so it will just sit here until someone picks it up." If I was that boss, I would say that I would pay for a cab or a train ticket to bring me the equipment, or I would come for it. If the real issue was money you would ask for such as thing and be granted it. I think your real motivation is to trade it for the salary you are owed, and to demonstrate your anger. But here's the thing: the level of anger you have right now, and refusing to meet your obligations because they owe you? It is, as the saying goes, like taking poison and waiting for your enemy to die. Do the right thing, because you are a good person even if they aren't. They will probably never pay you what they owe you. You can't make them do so, either. You have to give up your sense of control over that. You can't take the equipment to them. I believe that. If they show up and ask for it, well, it's theirs and it's not really a hostage to help you get your pay, much as you would like it to be. If they email and ask for it tell them you cannot bring it to them and it's safe at your house, and by the way, my salary is now X weeks late, when can I expect it? I think if they were going to come for it they would have already, but that's not your problem. You keep asking for your pay and explaining what is physically impossible, but if they show up, you give it to them. If you're worried they might break into your house I suppose putting the equipment elsewhere is feasible, but on the premise that they can have it if they show up and ask for it. (Also consider how they know you've done that? They might still ransack your house for it.) You're not a thief. It's their equipment. You treat them honourably even while they steal from you by withholding what you're owed. They have nothing to threaten you with. Once they have picked up the equipment, you owe them nothing and they can't hold anything over you. Then it is just a Department of Labour matter to get you paid. If you can find a local lawyer who is willing to be paid after winning the case, or a Citizens Advice Bureau who will help you for free, you may be able to get the salary more quickly. Or they may go bankrupt and never pay you. But you will still be yourself and not a thief, and that's important when your back is against the wall. 

Some people have had success by creating a non billable bucket called "churn and backtrack due to communication issues" and letting numbers pile up in there until someone does something about it. However it's entirely possible that the someone is you, the bucket is also called "unpaid overtime that I was supposed to apologize for spending", and the something you do is change jobs. But should that happen, you'll be doing it for a sensible logical reason after tracking what's been happening for a while, and not impulsively because you feel things aren't fair lately. 

There's a very good chance your boss wants you there to answer questions from the candidate, not to ask them. You can speak to what the job is like with complete authority. I would clarify whether your boss expects you to ask any questions at all. If I invite someone to "sit in on" an interview with a potential peer, I would not usually expect any pre-prepared questions from the sitter-inner at all. "What is your greatest weakness" or "where do you see yourself in 5 years" or any other standard question would be terrible choices. Anyone can ask those. IF the candidate goes to the same university as you, then "which is your favourite course this year and why?" could be ok if you're completely stumped. In general, your best bet is going to be reactive questions, ones that occur to you during the interview, rather than in advance. Say the candidate mentions a particular technique that they've just learned and want to use in the job, and you know it is very relevant to the work. You might ask a few questions to get an idea of just how familiar they are with that technique. Or perhaps at the end of the interview, when they haven't yet demonstrated that they know a particular topic that you are sure is really needed to do well in this job, you can ask them if they've taken that topic yet or had workplace exposure to it. In order to do a good job with reactive questions you have to think not about what you want to ask, but about what you would want to learn if it was your decision whether to hire this person or not. Then as the interview proceeds you can track whether you're learning everything you planned to learn. Most importantly, take your lead from the person who invited you. That includes clarifying whether you're there to be an information source for the candidate, to ask questions, or just to see how interviews work from the other side of the desk (a huge gift by the way, and one you should be grateful for.) Even if you are told that asking questions would be great, it's a good idea to make eye contact with the head interviewer before asking one, to get a quick confirmation that it's ok to do so at this moment. 

Code reviews are one way to increase quality and consistency, reduce bugs, and lower effort too. When everyone is familiar with all the code, they know what they can reuse from elsewhere, they know what will be affected by their changes, and they feel comfortable working in any part of the code. And as a second pair of eyes, they may spot errors before they cause damage. Note: in order to gain all these benefits there's no need for the review to be performed by a more senior developer. Consistency is very hard to enforce any other way. Say the team has a style preference about the way names are constructed: is it AddItem() or NewItem() or ItemAdd(), for example. Someone who writes a lot of code which all works fine but doesn't follow that style may be told to correct it, and may feel that's a big giant waste of time. (Most tools can make these sorts of changes trivially, so the response is more generally an emotional one about liking to be corrected or not liking feeling "wrong".) Bugspotting is rarer, but it does happen that someone will say "this doesn't look [threadsafe, scalable, exception-safe]; did you test under [typical production conditions that don't occur on a dev machine]?" and a real bug is prevented. Generally this means the person has to start over and feels really humiliated for having made a rookie mistake. The downside to code reviews is that they can get adversarial. It's hard for a reviewer not to think "what were you even thinking? Did you read our style guide? Did you even consider what production is like compared to your laptop?" and sometimes they say those things too. Making it a review gate where a senior person can pass or fail you intensifies the emotions. Developers often try to rebut corrections, saying that it's a matter of personal preference or that the reviewer is obsessed with an edge case that won't happen, or is just making up concerns to feel important or to humiliate the developer. Now imagine instead that peers looked over each other's stuff all the time. Not as a gate that you can't get through without a gold star, but as a natural way of working. And they pointed things out to each other early, to save work and pain, not to cause it. That would be much better, right? In the same way that continuous integration and continuous testing made developers happier and code better compared to code-for-two-years-now-the-testing-can-begin, little reviews all the time - many times a week - will make developers happier and code better than one final you-thought-you-were-done-but-The-Nitpicker-is-here code reviews. If you want to drop them entirely, you could. Plenty of code has been written and shipped without them. But it's a risk. Tests passing doesn't mean the code is readable and consistent. Not blowing up in production the first week doesn't mean it won't when you double your user numbers, or have 5 years of stuff in the database. You would be hard put to find any substitute for looking at the code to prevent those kinds of problems. 

Every time they email you and ask for the money, reply and ask for the P45. Don't just ignore the email because you don't have the paperwork. Reply. Assuming it is ok for you to have made this demand in the first place, it must be ok for you to stick to your guns on it. But you know, they will eventually come up with the P45 and you will have to pay the money back. You should never have spent it - you knew from the moment you saw it that it wasn't yours to keep. Start setting aside those payments now. Put the money in something that bears interest if you like. And when they finally either provide the form (that after 3 months it seems unlikely you need) or send you a stern lawyer letter saying the form and the money have nothing to do with each other and you need to pay it back now, you will have it saved up. In the unlikely event that they tell you they will no longer be pursuing you for the money, you can celebrate by spending it. But if things are as tight as you say, I would advise you to celebrate by putting it into a rainy-day or retirement fund. 

None of these will be cured by you asking them not to repeat. The first you need to ignore and the second and third mean that you and this person have your cues set at different levels. Try being "up a level" with your "got it" and your own summaries, and try wrapping up the meeting once you know what you need to know. Try explicitly asking "is there anything else we need to talk about" once you've heard things once. Don't interrupt a repetition, but do reply to it. Either "yes, I get it, three new reports, by Friday" kind of summary or [read notes] "yes, I have all that." Acknowledge what you're being told - especially if it's "make it so" because I have told you three times what needs to be done, but you're still standing in my office! 

You can surround it with thanking them for the opportunity to learn more about them, and praising them for being almost as good as the offer you took. You can tell them "it's not you, it's me" by citing a highly personal reason like geography (the other offer lets me live closer to where my SO is at school) or technology (I am fascinated by space and couldn't resist a chance to work on a project that will go there) if you want, and have something true handy. You can close with the wish your paths will continue to cross. But the heart of the letter, the sentence that matters, is simple, unequivocal, and polite. Build your letter around it. 

Sharepoint programming is .NET programming. You will be developing many skills (both technical and soft) you will be able to use even if you never do another Sharepoint project again: 

This most definitely depends on your employer. In general, time is not an expense, so if it says they will reimburse expenses that does not mean they will pay for your time. The word "reasonable" tells me you may expect people to decline your request to be reimbursed for the gum you bought in the airport or the wine you had at dinner, but I can't predict what your company considers reasonable. I had a client who sent out a series of memos listing more and more things they wouldn't reimburse for - it started with "sundries" like gum and entertainment like going out to a movie, a few weeks later another one saying no alcohol, and shortly after that one that said tips wouldn't be reimbursed since that was your choice. After I had told them I would not travel for them any more (already invoices with expenses took 2 or 3 months to pay, so that I had to lend them the plane fare from when I bought the ticket to 3 months after I did the work) there was one more announcing a flat per diem rate :) But I wanted to provide an alternate point of view on the paying for your time. As an employer I did not do it. Not because I'm cheap and stingy, but because I never wanted going on a trip to be seen as a revenue opportunity. I wanted the staff to want to go for its own value, not because "I can rack up 26 hours at time and a half if I travel on Sunday night, work till 8pm each night networking with attendees, and I don't get home Friday until late. That's a whole free week of vacation later this year!" I want them to go to the conference or whatever because they will get something from it, not to get overtime pay. So my policy was:
