Yes attire can have an influence on promotion. As you move up the ladder, you often have more client-facing tasks and no one is going to promote someone they think might be an embarrassment. Further, how you dress influences what people think of you and how seriously they take you. So no grungy clothes, t-shirts, sandals, too sexy or too tight clothes if you want to make the move into senior managment someday. In some professions people think they can dress how they want and that is one of the perks. But I have noticed that the grungier or lessformally dressed the person, the less likely they are to be selected for management responsibilities. Now that suits many people just fine (especially in the software world where I work), they don't want to be managers. But if you aspire to be a manager, then you need to dress like the managers not non-managers. Smart money has always been on dressing for the position you want to have not the one you do have. 

Yes negative publicity can affect how you are viewed even if you were not involved. Ask the many people who worked at Enron about how their resumes were perceived after the scandal. Since this is volunteer work which typical counts very little in evaluating resumes, I would drop it. 

As someone new to the work world, you need to be aware that there are several things that are taken into consideration when responding to a request of this nature. The first is capability. Can this group of people even perform this task. You took this into account and answered. Unfortunately it was the wrong answer because you failed to consider the other two things. The second thing is priorities. How does it fit with the other work we are tasked to do. If you did not know the answer to this, you should have passed this on to the team lead and told the guy that you were not sure if the team would be able to take it on. The final considerations is organizational politics. Perhaps he doesn't want to do it because it will make the team that should be doing it mad and he needs them on his side for other projects. Again if you do not know the political situation, you should have pushed the answer off until the team lead returned. I bring up these things, so you know what to do in the future and what besides capability needs to be considered before you can say that the team can do something. Remember it is not your job to accept work projects but your boss's job. So don't feel bad in referring things to him (or his boss when he is out); you generally have to be fairly senior before having the authority to accept requests. Should he have told the guys the bad news himself? Possibly, but most likely he wanted you to feel the pain so you don't do this again. What to say to the other person. Let him know that your team lead returned and he feels the task should be handled by the other team. If he has further questions, refer him to the team lead. Make sure to apologize for promising what you could not deliver. It is often helpful to say that you were not aware of the whole situation and made a mistake in committing to the task. Admitting a mistake on your part looks better to everyone involved than blaming your boss. Some people hate to admit they made mistakes, but mistakes are expected (especially from junior people) and so no one will think less of you for admitting you went beyond your authority by accepting the task. If he pushes back instead of accepting that you have to do what your boss asked of you, again refer him to the team lead. Don't let him intimidate you into backing down, your lead is your boss and that is who you have to please not this guy. And then in the future, do not let anyone push you into committing to a task you are not authorized to accept. This is especially the case with something like this where the requester might have known the team lead wouldn't take on the work and he tried to get you to take it on while the guy was away from his desk. People do things like this in the office world and naive people get caught in them. You also need to have a long talk with you lead about priorities and tasks that can be accepted and those that can't be accepted when the lead is not present You need to know who to refer such things to if you don't have the authority to make such commitments. You need to understand what things, if anything, you can commit to in the lead's absence. It is especially important not to commit to anything if the lead will be available shortly. If he was just at a meeting or lunch or in the rest room, you should have told the guy when he would be back. If he was gone for the day or a vacation, you should have known who to send the issue to for resolution. Make sure now, you know what to do if similar circumstances come up again. It's good to want to be helpful and to be able to meet requests. But you need to understand the underlying reasons why something is or is not a good idea to take on. As you get more senior, you will find that by considering all three things, you will soon be trusted to make commitments. It helps to start to learn what drives priorities in your organization. For instance, where I work, the highest priority is anything that is making our production applications unusable by a group of people, then anything making production unusable by one person, then anything with legal or regulatory considerations, then anything that a client wants immediately even if we don't think it is all that critical (especially if a client is unhappy for any reason about anything unrelated). When multiple clients are involved, the priorities shift to include how important an individual client is to the business. This is one reason why you need to start to pay attention to such things if you aspire to be the lead of a group of people. So when there are multiple tasks, ask why one is prioritized over another if you don't know. 

I personally would worry about identity theft (they have your name, your birthdate and nationality) using this approach aside from the fact that it is a bad choice to use a picture unless it is the cultural norm in your country. Why would they care about your birthdate? That could cause discrimination as well. You are reaching the age whene age discrimination can be very real. Plus if the information is actually needed in your country for the resume to get past HR, putting it into a photo means that it will get discarded by many automated systems because it is not in text. Personally I would not recommend this approach. 

Why not give them the full details and provide a rough calculation of how much your Gross would have to be for your net to increase by 10%. SO say something like my gross salary is 100K, but after taxes and required other deductions I net 60K. Then detail how much you pay in taxes and other required deductions like Medicare, health insurance. Enclose your leave and earnings statement if you want. 

You have to proactively manage your own career. You are assigned to a task outside your technical specialty and which is not one you want to do. This is not abnormal, I have never worked anywhere that didn't give me "other duties as assigned." And the more senior I have gotten, them more of these I have because someone who can understand the business as well as development can be very valuable in a senior context. However, what you are describing goes well beyond the norm. If you want to be assigned other work, you have to do a couple of things: First, make sure you are person someone would want on their technical team. In part that means doing a decent job (note I did not say "do a super excellent, nobody can possibly replace me at this" job) at what you are assigned whether it is boring or not. There is no reason to give you more technical responsibilities if you haven't done reasonably well at the responsibilities you were given. This is particularly true when you have no track record at the company in your real technical field. (There is a lot to learn from getting in the nitty gritty detail of testing. It may make you a better programmer when you get back to it. But still - not full time for months.) Next talk to your boss about assigning programming tasks to you and about how long this particular task can be expected to last. You have done him a favor by doing this work that no one else wanted to do (the junior people are often given the least wanted work), now ask for your reward. In the future when being given tasks outside your expertise, talk specifically about how long you will be expected to do them and when you can return to your normal work at the time the other work is assigned. You have to hit a balance here between being a team player and being a doormat that every cruddy job can be thrown to. If you don't ask for what you want, you will not likely get it. Your boss should be aware that you expect to be rewarded for doing a task he needs done that is outside the normal scope of your duties. Be aware that you might be doing this particular task because there is currently no work for you or because a new project is coming up they want you for but can't put you on just yet and they are keeping you busy in the meantime. Knowing the reasons behind the assignment could make it more palatable. This is why it is important to have upfront discussions of the tasks outside your normal job description and the impact it might have on you. In any event, this is not the long-term work you want to do. You need to make sure your boss is aware of that and if you do not get a good response to your request to be moved back to the work you were hired for, then it may be time to look for another job. You say you are in a large organization, you may be able to find a group that needs devs and ask for a lateral transfer. Or you might have to look outside the company. It is a fine thing to be a team player and help out where it is need without regard to your job description, but this has gone way beyond helping out and is actively affecting your own future career path. It is time to ask to be reassigned or move on. Pay attention to the grapevine at your company, find out about upcoming work and put in your request to be assigned to something particular that is coming up. Politic for the assignments you want. If you don't, well you can see the result of that right now, can't you? This is too short a space to get into how to play the political game, but I would suggest you read a few books on the subject. They will help you manage your own career.
