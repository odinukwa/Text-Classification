The choice of group action by Zagier is set of invertible $2 \times 2$ matrices acting on pairs $X \times Y = $ $$ \big\{\text{quadratic forms }ax^2 + bxy+cy^2 \text{ with }b^2 - 4ac = D \} \times \{ \text{pairs of integers }x,y \in \mathbb{Z}\big\} $$ and $G = SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ which is solutions to $ad-bc = 1$ for $a,b,c,d \in \mathbb{Z}$. Lastly the special set 

In Quadratic reciprocity and the sign of the Gauss sum via the finite Weil representation Gurevich, Hadani and Howe discuss the Gauss sums, which are finite field analogues of the Gamma function $\Gamma(n+1)$: $$ G_p = \sum_{x \in \mathbb{F}_p} e^{\frac{2\pi i x^2}{p}} = \left\{ \begin{array}{rc} \sqrt{p} & \text{if }p \equiv 1 \mod 4 \\ i\sqrt{p} & \text{if }p \equiv 3 \mod 4\end{array}\right.$$ with the relationship $G_p^2 = (\tfrac{-1}{p})\cdot p$. Using properties of the Weil representation of $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$, and the fact that the Finite Fourier Transform corresponds to $$ S = \left( \begin{array}{cr} 0 & -1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{array} \right)$$ they are able to prove quadratic reciprocity and correctly get the sign of the Legendre symbol. In fact, they compute the ratio: $$ (\tfrac{p}{q}) (\tfrac{q}{p}) = \frac{G_p \cdot G_q}{G_{pq}}$$ 

These notations, unfortunately, exclude qualified readers from other fields who potentially like to understand. 

Also I found it odd to see the same regularization formulas over and over in physics papers, but sometimes, we can regulaize an L-function but there is no differential operator to go with it. 

I have been looking into equivariant space-filling curves $S^1\to S^2$ as discussed by Cannon & Thurston in these two papers: 

A broader less careful definition could be find in the discussion of Gaiotto and Kapustin from 2015. [GK]: 

The Fibonacci word is the limit of the sequence of words starting with "0" and satisfying rules $0 \to 01, 1 \to 0$. It's equivalent to have initial conditions $S_0 = 0, S_1 = 01$ and then recursion $S_n= S_{n-1}S_{n-2}$. I want to know what words cannot appear as subwords in the limit $S_\infty$. At first I thought 000 and 11 were the only two that could not appear. Then I noticed 010101. Is there any characterization of which words can or cannot appear as subwords of the Fibonacci word? Loosely related, this word appears as the cut sequence of the line of slope $\phi = (1 + \sqrt{5})/2$ though the origin. 

I have a somewhat unconventional view of the Prime Number Theorem as a "quantification" of the infinitude of primes. Here I recall the argument of Furstenberg. Define a topology $\mathcal{X}$ on $\mathbb{Z}$. 

hmm derivatives interlace zeros... however $ a^+=1- d/dx$ behaves nicely on polynomials. It should preserve positivity of the roots and shift the leading zero by $+n$ with a small correction term where $n = \deg p$. here we have $x=0$ as a root with multiplicity $k$ and they should hop forward a bit 

Proposal: Tree-Like Continued Fraction If we try to derive a continued fraction for cube roots let's see how we get in trouble: $$ \sqrt[3]{2} \approx 1 $$ That's really lousy guess but let's see how far we are off: $$ \sqrt[3]{2} - 1 = \frac{1}{1 + \sqrt[3]{2} + \sqrt[3]{4}} \tag{$\square$}$$ so let's backtrack we actually needed two pieces of information: $$ \sqrt[3]{2} \approx 1 \hspace{0.25in} \textbf{and} \hspace{0.25in} \sqrt[3]{4} \approx 1 $$ The cube root of 4 is still not quite $2 = \sqrt[3]{8}$. Now let's try: $$ \sqrt[3]{4} - 1 = \frac{3}{1 + \sqrt[3]{4} + \sqrt[3]{16}} = \frac{3}{1 + \sqrt[3]{4} + 2\sqrt[3]{2}} \tag{$\Delta$} $$ And then run all of this back into the equation we started from: $$ \sqrt[3]{2} - 1 = \frac{1}{1 + \sqrt[3]{2} + \sqrt[3]{4}} = \cfrac{1}{1 + \left(1 + \frac{1}{1 + \sqrt[3]{2} + \sqrt[3]{4}} \right) + \left( 1 + \frac{3}{1 + \sqrt[3]{4} + 2\sqrt[3]{2}}\right)}$$ Let's make it look a little bit cleaner but the same: $$ \sqrt[3]{2} = 1 + \frac{1}{1 + \sqrt[3]{2} + \sqrt[3]{4}} = 1 + \cfrac{1}{3 + \frac{1}{1 + \sqrt[3]{2} + \sqrt[3]{4}} + \frac{3}{1 + 2\sqrt[3]{2}+ \sqrt[3]{4}}}$$ Using the $\square$ and $\Delta$ pattern we can get a regular infinite pattern this way. 

For freshman calculus students, I try to explain we're just putting a "microscope" to the different curves and we usually get one of four pictures. alt text $URL$ But picturing the kinds of pathologies that can occur is much harder as you move beyond calculus. The Cantor function. We can picture the Cantor function as flat if you zoom in outside the Cantor set, but the "devil's staircase" if you zoom in at a Cantor set point. Brownian motion will never ``calm down" no matter how much you zoom in -- it does not have bounded variation. It would be nice to have a picture book of these pathologies. 

In quantum field theory class, we are doing spinors. The representations of the Lorentz algebra $\mathfrak{so}(3,1) = \mathfrak{su}(2) + i \mathfrak{su}(2)$ are indexed by two integers. Then (1,2) and (2,1) are the left and right spinor representations, $\phi_a, \phi_{\dot{a}}$. In the homework, we're asked to prove identities using spinor notation like $\psi\chi = \chi\psi$ and $(\psi\sigma^\mu\chi^\dagger)^\dagger = \chi\sigma^\mu\psi^\dagger$ by unsuppressing the indices (so $\psi \chi = \psi_a \chi^a$ and $\psi^\dagger \chi^\dagger = \psi^{\dagger\dot{a}} \chi_{\dagger\dot{a}}$. I started developing "box" notation to keep track of which index is being matched/contracted with which other index in expressions like $ \epsilon^{ab}\epsilon^{\dot{a}\dot{b}}\sigma^\mu_{a \dot{a}}\sigma^{\nu}_{b\dot{b}} $. Since these are anticommuting variables, such notation would have to remember order of multiplication. I started coming up with nice ways to handle upper and lower indices with upward and downwoard pointing boxes, tricks for handing Dirac and Majorana spinors and Hermitian conjugates. Has diagrammatic calculus for spinors already been built somewhere?? I think Penrose did such a thing for twistors. 

This superconformal index is the trace over representations over a certain superalgebra. It can also be considered a matrix integral over Haar measure. In the case of the cylinder $$ \mu(a,b) = \Delta(a) \mathcal{I}^V(a) \delta(a, b^{-1})$$ at least, in the zero area limit. In special cases, they find functions $f^\alpha(a)$ (in our case $=\langle \lambda|x \rangle$) orthogonal with respect to "propagator measure": $$ \oint [da] \Delta(a)\mathcal{I}^V(a) f^\alpha(a) f^\beta (a^{-1}) = \delta^{\alpha \beta}$$ Then they can define a new metric and structure constants \begin{eqnarray} \mathcal{I}(a,b,c) &=& \sum_{\alpha, \beta, \gamma} C_{\alpha\beta\gamma}f^\alpha(a)f^\beta(b)f^{\gamma}(c)\\ \mu^{\alpha\beta} &=& \oint [da]\oint [db] \mu(a,b) f^\alpha(a)f^\beta(b)\\ \end{eqnarray} These generalize the orthogonality of characters relations (at least for compact Lie groups). 

It is known these types of processes demonstrate repulsion (compared to the Poisson process) and I would like to demonstrate this in the classroom. 

Spin chains have to do with the raising and lowering operators in the 2-dimensional representation of $SU(2)$ : \[\left.\begin{array}{cccc} S^+ : & |\uparrow \rangle & \mapsto & 0 \\ & |\downarrow \rangle & \mapsto & |\uparrow \rangle \\ \hline S^- : & |\uparrow \rangle & \mapsto & |\downarrow \rangle \\ & |\downarrow \rangle & \mapsto & 0 \\ \hline \\ S^z : & |\uparrow \rangle & \mapsto & \tfrac{1}{2}|\uparrow \rangle \\ & |\downarrow \rangle & \mapsto & \tfrac{1}{2}|\downarrow \rangle \end{array}\right. \] The Hamiltonian acts on a tensor product of $SU(2)$ representations $V^{\otimes M}$. \[ \mathcal{H} = - \frac{1}{2} \sum_{n=1}^M \bigg[ \sigma_n^x \sigma_{n+1}^x + \sigma_n^y \sigma_{n+1}^y + \Delta \sigma_n^z \sigma_{n+1}^z\bigg] \] Various values of $\Delta$ have different interpretations. Since $[\mathcal{H}, S^z] = 0$ we can diagonalize in terms of the $\uparrow, \downarrow$ states. The Bethe Ansatz equations are the eigenvalue equations for $\mathcal{H}$ in this basis. None of this tells you how to solve the eigenvalue equations, here they are. 

I think you need to take the log of the Brownian motion and look at the imaginary coordinate. $$R + i\theta = \log(X+iY)$$ Since $z \mapsto \log z$ is conformal, there exists a time change taking one Brownian motion to the other. Also, notice that $R_t$ is related to the Cauchy distribution. 

There are various statements floating around here are two: [1,3] Let $f : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{C}$ be multiplicative function such that $|f(n)| \leq 1$. Then if we establish for all real numbers $|t| < T$ that: $$ \sum_{p < x} \frac{1 - \mathrm{Re}[\, f(p) p^{-it} \,]}{p} \geq M$$ then the average value of $f(n)$ is quite small: $$ \frac{1}{x} \sum_{n < x} f(n) \ll (1+M)e^{-M} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{T}} $$ even the "cheap" version stated in the blog might already imply the prime number theorem. [2] If the mean value of $f$ is "large" in absolute value, then $f(n)$ pretends to be $n^{it}$ for some "small" real $t$. Here, pretending is defined in terms of Kullback-Liebler distance: $$ \mathbb{D}(f, g; x)^2 = \sum_{p \leq x} \frac{1 - \mathrm{Re}\big[\,f(p)\overline{g(p)}\,\big]}{p} $$ All of the proofs seem long and technical, and the new proof may not be much simpler. I still might like to know if the weaker version implies PNT 

I would like to construct 2D vector bundles over the punctured torus, but I don't know a lot of K-theory. Over the square, there can only be the trivial bundle, but now since $\pi_1(\mathbb{T}^2\backslash \{ pt\})= \langle x,y \rangle $ (the free group on two elements) I simply need two matrices $x,y \in GL(V)$ where $V = \mathbb{R}^2$ is the fiber over the bundle. It looks like I have shown that vector bundles over a surface are parameterized by representations of the fundamental group $\pi_1(\mathbb{T}^2 \backslash \{ pt\})$ over $V$. I wonder that many of these representations are the same... that you can find some element $U \in GL(V)$ so that if $x,y$ determine a vector bundle the, $UxU^{-1}, UyU^{-1}$ define an equivalent bundle. In turn, this looks like I am asking about representations of a quiver $\circ \to^2 \circ$ of pairs of matrices up to simultaneous similarity. Is this the right way to classify spaces vector bundles over Riemann surfaces? What is the relationship between vector bundles over Riemann surfaces, the representation variety and quiver representations? 

so we can show a zero on the line $\mathrm{Re}(s) = 1$ leads to a contradiction. He wrote a review of Newman's proof , but this result has more geometric flavor. The next paragraph is on the equidistribution of the horocycle flow. He says the equidistribution of the horocycle flow - with a certain error - can imply the Riemann hypothesis -- that $\zeta(s) \neq 0$ when $\mathrm{Re}(s) \neq \frac{1}{2}$. 

$\text{PSL}_2(\mathbb{Z}[i])$ is a textbook exmple of a Kleininan group and there are basica ways to construct hyperbolic 3-manifolds, such as $\mathbb{H}^3/\text{PSL}_2(\mathbb{Z}[i])$. 

In one variable, $x^q - x \equiv 0 $ for all $x \in \mathbb{F}_q$. This function would not be constant over an algebraic extension $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$, which can always be constructed In 3 variables, $(x^q+y^q+z^q) - (x+y+z) \equiv 0 $ . The notions of "algebraic surface" and "tangent vector" are shaky in finite characteristic. I guess you could formally write the partial derivatives: $$ a \partial_x P + b \partial_y P + c \partial_z P = 0 $$ Still not sure what it "tangent to $S$" means in finite characteristic. There may need to be some condition on $P,S$ even if the degrees are small. 

Is there any literature on the order structure coming from round-robin tournaments? I play games on littlegolem and the tournaments are mostly 5x5 round-robins. I noticed at the end, after sorting for wins and "sum of scores" all the matrices look the same. $$ \begin{array}{c|ccccc|cc} 1 & & 2 & 2 & 2 & 2 & 8 & 24\\\\ 2 & 0 & & 2 & 2 & 2 & 6 & 12 \\\\ 3 & 0 & 0 & & 2 & 2 & 4 & 4 \\\\ 4 & 0 & 0 & 0 & & 2 & 2 & 0 \\\\ 5 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & & 0 & 0 \end{array}$$ Can all tournament grids be ordered this way even for 5x5? Is there literature on partial orders or well-orders induced from tournaments? 

Comments in there point in various directions, e.g. Three-Dimensional Link Theory and Invariants of Plane Curve Singularities but it's on a different "setup". 

So now, there is also a link between 6-vertex model and domino tilings. Does that also have fine print? 

Schur-Weyl duality is the decomposition of this double-representation $$ \mathbb{C}^n \otimes \mathbb{C}^n \otimes \dots \otimes \mathbb{C}^n = \sum_D \pi_k^D \otimes \rho_n^D$$ into tensor products of irreducible representations of S(k) and U(n). D runs over young diagrams with k boxes and up to n rows. Each of the young diagrams appears once. Your questions clearly involved the duality between the permutation and unitary groups, though I couldn't explain to you how. You might also see Fulton's book, Young Tableaux. 

My concern, these may not be theoretical enough. A lot signal processing has uncanny resemblance to just plain Fourier analysis. Stein-Shakarchi doesn't tell you what a high-pass filter or low-pass filter is, specifically. He just figures you'll find out on your own. One cannot forget Daubechies' "Ten Lectures on Wavelets" 

I was reading about the Hasse-Weil bound for the number of points in on a curve over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$. $$ \big| |C(\mathbb{F}_q)| - (q+1) \big| \leq 2g \sqrt{q} $$ However, this reminded me quite a bit of the Chebyshev inequality. $$ \mathbb{P}\big[ |X - \mathbb{E}[X]| \geq k \sigma \big] \leq \frac{1}{k^2} $$ Is there a way to prove - or at least interpret - the Hasse-Weil bound as an estimate of the "Expected" number of points on a curve? 

For a long time I wouldn't look at the proof, just the statement. That's one level of understanding. Then I started reading the proofs right away. Many interesting details don't always appear in the statement. That's another layer. However, if you read a proof straight through, you get the false impression that each step follows logically from the last so the theorem is obvious. Try to explain the proof to your friends or try to prove it yourself. "Reading with your pencil" you can learn which steps are surprising and which are natural.
