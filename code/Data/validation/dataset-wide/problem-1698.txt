I stopped RabbitMQ for a short time on my Windows (2012) server. However, when I tried to restart it, it would shut down again within about 30 seconds. The Windows Event Log had the following message: 

is a MySQL-only option (other Database software uses different commands -- for example, PostgreSQL uses a special column type called ). Therefore, when you export with it will not be included in the dump. You can either stop exporting with the PostgreSQL compatibility flag, or you can manually add the option. In either case, if you actually plan to import this schema into PostgreSQL, you will have to modify the dump file to change the column type to for any column that you want to auto increment. 

I would run a script on the VyOS machines that checks the state of the upstream connection and then does / on the other side as needed. The simplest way to do this is putting scripts in (check if the interface that went down is the updated side and bring down the other side of it is) and (check if the interface that went up is the updated side and bring up the other side of it is). Alternatively, you could run a monitoring script once a minute with cron (or Systemd Timers, or any similar scheduler), or you could write it as an infinite loop that sleeps for a few seconds to get sub-minute checking. 

This appears to be a known issue for WSUS servers that use an authenticated proxy server. Microsoft has release a hotfix for this issue that you can apply to your server. According to one person who tried it (linked above), you must perform the following steps to reset the WSUS content repository after installing the hotfix. This is because WSUS "thinks" in the SQL database that all updates have been downloaded when in fact they failed. To do this perform the following steps: 

Yes, that is the entire file (for each application)! However, a few of the sites are in subfolders, necessitating the following change: 

In most cases, the 2.4 equivalent of is to enclose the directives in a block. The equivalent of would be a block. For more information on the changes and equivalents, this presentation (PDF) by Rich Bowen might be helpful. 

I am setting up a PHP application on IIS 8.5 on Windows Server 2012 R2. I have successfully set up this application before on several Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows Server 2012 machines, but this is the first 2012 R2 machine I am using. The PHP application has and directories that it needs to write into. On all previous machines, I have set up the PHP site to run in the Default Application Pool, and then given permission to the group to read the entire site and to write to those directories. So far, this has worked on all of the previous servers I have used. However, on this new server, PHP still says it does not have permission to write to the needed locations. I checked in Task Manager to be sure that the IIS process (and the PHP CGI process) run as the expected user and find that they run as , as expected. However, the permissions don't seem to have worked. I tried stopping and restarting IIS, recycling the App Pool, and adding the user permissions directly to the folders, none of which have helped. What is wrong here? Why does this not work when it worked with no trouble at all on four older servers? 

You need to have the settings stored in the server-level config file instead of in the file in the folder. One way to do this is to manually move the configuration from the file into the file, which is in . However, it is much safer not to edit this file by hand. Instead you can use with the flag at the end (where ... is a setting to set). To add PHP using AppCmd, you need to add a handler mapping in and a FastCGI entry in . The official PHP instructions for IIS have the basic commands - all you need to do is add the site name after and the commit flag at the end. Alternatively, you can use the IIS Manager's "Configuration Editor". Microsoft's official tutorial for the Configuration editor is at $URL$ 

I can use it the way it is if that's the answer, but it would make it a lot easier to manage the sites that I have if this can be done. The sites use the same basic code with different themes and database connections, and the way it works now I have to modify the htaccess file every time we deploy a new version of the code (because it is checked into Git). If we can make it that someone doesn't have to remember to make this modification every time, that would be really great. 

The sites about which I originally asked this question are no longer live, but here's what i ended up doing. I ended up moving these sites to a server running Nginx, where all configuration is done in the config files of the server using a directive. It was much easier to manage that way. 

Vagrant's built-in provisioning features should be a perfect fit for this. There are a whole bunch of ways you could do it, but the simplest is probably to take the guts of your Upstart script and make them a plain shell script. Then, put one of these blocks in your : 

This successfully authenticates users against DreamHost's IMAP server so they can log in to Horde. Once logged in through IMP, they can also access Kronolith (calendar component). I am now trying to set up CalDAV support for the calendar, but I can't get the authentication to work. As a simple test, I take the calendar URL from the Horde that looks like this -- -- and I try to use CURL (with option ) to retrieve the calendar. Horde returns the following response: 

On my Windows 8.1 machines, the so-called "April Update" from KB2919355 was installed automatically by Windows Update, as expected. However, on my 2012 R2 server, the update was not automatically installed, and Windows Update says "no updates are available". I know that I can download and apply KB2919355 from the Microsoft Downloads center, but missing this update makes me worried that this machine may be missing other updates as well. The server is updating directly from Microsoft, not from WSUS, and there is nothing else that I know of which could be blocking the update. The machine does have the prerequisite update from KB2919442. How can I find out why this update is missing? What can I do to make sure this doesn't continue to be an issue with other updates? (I wish I had access to another 2012 R2 server to confirm whether this is an issue specific to this machine or not, but my other Windows servers are running 2008 R2 or 2012 original, so this update doesn't apply to them.) 

Close any open WSUS consoles. Go to Administrative Tools – Services and STOP the "Update Services" service. In Windows Explorer browse to the WSUSContent folder (typically or ) Delete ALL the files and folders in the WSUSContent folder. Go to Administrative Tools – Services and START the "Update Services" service. Open a command prompt and navigate to the folder: . Run the command 

I have no idea if the last line is actually needed or not, but users were waiting so I didn't try to experiment. 

When you set up the server to do NAT, it doesn't know what you want to do with the ports on the public side. You need to configure the server to let Internet users access the web site. Here's how: 

I have set up a Horde Groupware Webmail Edition server, primarily to use webmail (provided by the hosting provider) and calendar (provided by us). Authentication is set up using IMAP authentication through the IMP (webmail) component: Main Horde : 

However, I know that there is very little running on the machine, and nothing else should be trying to bind to that port. What could be causing this? 

I would have thought that the path is relative to the .htaccess file in which it is configured, but it seems that it is actually relative to the requested URL. Is there a way to have act the way that I expected? 

It turns out that the Gitlab sample Apache configuration that we originally used (over a year ago) was missing the check for whether files exist before it would go back to the Unicorn server and was also missing the directives to not proxy certain directories (like ), but the Unicorn server wasn't configured to serve these files. Updating the Apache configuration to match the newest sample version fixed the problem. 

Because Thunderbird is based on the same platform as Firefox, you should be able to use the same tools as Firefox would use. There are several options of tools you can use, in order of simplest to most complex: 1. It may be built-in! Thunderbird has experimental support for auto-importing certificates from the OS Certificate store. Here's how to enable it manually: 

where contained . However, I still could not access the web interface. The only way I could find to resolve the issue was to allow outside access to port as well - then access to port worked. However, this means that the web interface is now available from outside on two ports, the default and the one I want. What is the correct configuration for doing this so that the web interface is available internally on and externally on ? 

That article about WinCache is over seven years old, and is only about PHP 5.2.x and 5.3.x, which did not come with a built-in OpCache that worked on Windows. Now that PHP comes with its own OpCache, you should be using that one. Additionally, the official release notes for WinCache version 1.3.5.0, the first version to support PHP 5.5, say: 

In the end, I had to switch the main Horde authentication to also use IMAP directly instead of passing it back to IMP. Here's what I added to : 

As discussed in the OwnCloud forum, the OwnCloud sync client also does not necessarily work with self-signed certificates. Try switching to HTTP temporarily and see if that works. (However, others have gotten self-signed certififcates to work with no problem, and the error you are receiving does not say that this is the issue despite the fact that the symptoms are the same.) You may also just be having an issue where WebDAV is working properly but the tests are failing, thus preventing WebDAV from working. You can bypass the WebDAV tests in the admin site by adding to the file. 

No, it is not mandatory to have the any particular format for domain names. You can put almost anything you want in DNS, and companies do use all kinds of schemes. That said, the word "hostname" if often used to mean two different things. It can mean 

Note that the script here is inside a "heredoc", which means that you need to be careful to make sure that the token which ends the heredoc is in the right place - i.e. on a line by itself, without extra whitespace. (The link about heredoc above does show a way to allow whitespace, but you need to be careful anyway.) Pointing to a script file. Vagrant will copy this file into the directory and execute it. 

The name of the computer. This can be in many different formats, including single words, full domain names, and anything in between. The full domain name of a computer, whether the computer does or does not have that full name set on the computer as its host name. 

4. Mozilla's executable You can create a login script that runs to add the certificate to the user's profile. This forum post has an example script (for Firefox), of which the important part is copied below (with modifications for Thunderbird): 

Is there a way to get Horde to use the IMAP login for the calendar in CalDAV the way that it works for the web interface? 

I edited to remove the argument from the call to and got an error with a stack trace. I can't post the full stack trace (because I can't scroll back in the terminal window to get it), but the last function call before the error was some function that has to do with getting the system language. I had previously set in order to build some ruby gems. I ran and now I am able to start MongoDB. (The interesting thing is that I then again and restarted MongoDB and it still worked.) 

The command can be used to see what program is using each port. (Note that these arguments are only for Windows. The similar linux command would be . Both platforms require the user to be an administrator to execute these commands.) In this case, I had left a Google Chrome window open to the RabbitMQ management console () and Chrome was somehow keeping the port in use. After I closed the browser tab, I was able to start RabbitMQ. 

Open the menu and click 'Options' Go to the 'Advanced' tab Click 'Config Editor' Click 'I accept the risk!' if prompted to do so. Search for Double-click to set it to true. 

I installed MongoDB on a Debian VM using from the 10gen repository. Some time after the install, I wanted to enable authentication in the configuration file, but when I ran , it stopped and refused to start again. I am able to reproduce this reliably: every time I run the server starts. However. when I run , it says 

However, when the site's rewrites contain slashes, for example, if the application is and the path within it is , then Apache looks for instead of and returns a 500 with the following message in the log: 

One reason for this could be that your DNS is misconfigured. One thing you could do is use a tool like WireShark to see what IP addresses the server is trying to connect to, then look up those IP addresses and make sure they are owned by Microsoft. Another possibility is that you have some firewall or proxy server that is not letting the traffic through. Make sure that all of the following list of domains are reachable from your server: 

You can automate this by deploying a config file to the computers. 2. Deploy a default profile You can add the certificate to your own profile, then copy your profile's file to the main program folder. Any new profile that is created on the computer will then use that version of . Unfortunately, this will not help for any user who has already opened Thunderbird because their profiles have already been created. See $URL$ for more info. 3. Deploy a config file As mentioned and linked above in option #1, Mozilla products support deploying a configuration file in . You can put a script in that file which adds your certificate to the certificate store. Here's an example: 

I am running Gitlab reverse-proxied through an Apache 2.2 server for my work group. Recently, we wanted to upload some group logos to use as project Avatars. The uploads all completed successfully (confirmed in a directory listing through SSH), but the images never showed up - instead we just got a 404. We are using Apache's mod_proxy to connect to a Unicorn backend. 

Note that, despite the name, the option does not transform the schema into a form that is guaranteed to work in the database you chose. All that the option does is remove things that are unique to MySQL so that you can more easily finish the transformation yourself, either by hand or using some kind of script that you have built. From the documentation: 

Using an "inline" script. Vagrant will copy the contents from the into a script in the directory and execute it. 

I manage a large number of PHP applications using front controllers and the following htaccess file: 

If there are a few specific commands that you need to execute, you can set up sudo (via the file) to allow a particular list of users (and/or groups) to execute those commands without a password. 

(Note: Do not confuse this with Microsoft's program of the same name) 5. You can use a management tool CCK2 is a third-party management tool for Mozilla products. See its documentation for more details. 

As you could probably guess, the at the beginning means that the path is relative to the site/vhost, and here the path needs to be relative to the directory. (If I were using for this instead of , I would have to add a to each subdirectory as needed, in a similar fashion.) I thought that I could get around this by doing:
