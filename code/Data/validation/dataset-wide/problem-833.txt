This experiment is still done frequently, but you need a powerful pulsed laser, precise pointing (error below about 20 arc seconds) and a sensitive detector. Amateurs will fail most likely, because they won't get access to an appropriate equipment. Here is a youtube video, which may give an impression of how difficult it is to perform the experiment. 

The totally unsatisfying answer is: Dark energy. It's formally quantified by the cosmological constant. There are lots of hypotheses about the nature of this energy. Quantum theoretical explanations are considered as likely candidates; the Casimir effect is at least an experimentally accessible way to show the existence of vacuum energy. 

There is no known upper limit for the mass of a black hole. A black hole stops attracting matter, when there is no matter within reach. In this case the (macroscopic) black hole is assumed to evaporate by Hawking radiation over very long time scales. The estimates for the currently (as of early 2014) known most massive black holes (ultramassive black holes) are below about 40 billion ($4\cdot 10^{10}$) solar masses. A black hole of that mass would have a Schwarzschild radius of about 780 times the distance Earth-Sun, or about 4.5 light-days. (Hypothetical) micro black holes are assumed to be able to evaporate faster than they can accrete matter. 

The answer to the headline question is: No. Most of Saturn's rings are below the Roche limit of about 2.5 Saturn radii. Hence tidal forces will prevent that part of the rings to form a (large) moon. Actually, part of the rings may be caused by loss of material from some of Saturn's moons, as suspected from observations of Enceladus. Accretion of Earth is still going on. So any number between millions of years and billions of years of accretion time for a planet can be justified. Half of Earth's mass should have accreted within 10 million years, see this paper. 

A large moon (the size of a planet) would be modeled by the fluid model, meaning friction and tensile strength are too weak to modify the shape of the moon significantly, shape is determined by rotation, vortices, self-gravitation, and tidal forces. Smaller moons, like Phobos would likely follow a rubble pile model. On circular orbits tidal heating doesn't play a major role. The fluid model has been studied extensively. The occuring shapes are known as equilibrium figures. For a full understanding, the parent body should be considered together with the moons, as one system. (Fluid) moons getting too close to the Roche limit gradually deform (tidal heating depends on inner friction), and start to shed mass at some point. There exist solutions with vortices, and vortex-free solutions, depending on the properties of the fluid. The lost mass may either form an n-body system outside the Roche limit, or form a ring system, mostly inside the Roche limit. Closer to the planet, it may either impact, and fuse with the planet to a the overall spheroid of the planet, or - if the planet is already rotating fast, and the mass of the moon was sufficiently high - increase the rotation of the planet, such that it may undergo e.g. the Maclaurin - Jacobi series, up to the point, that it cannot accrete more mass. There are several more possibilities in detail. Rubble piles with tensile strength are more likely to undergo sudden shape changes or disruptions than rubble piles without tensile strength. Behaviour of rubble piles without tensile strength depends on friction. The less friction, the closer to the fluid model. The more tensile strength of the rubble pile, the more it behaves like the ridgid model. Ridgid objects may survive well below the Roche limit for fluid objects, but disrupt suddenly when tidal forces get too strong. 

May, or may not. No. Q1: A formula: yes, a simple formula: no. Q2: Not for each point on Earth. This is e.g. due to different distance quotients. Q3: Depends on distances, sizes, angular velocities, position on Earth. Q4: Yes, but it's different for each point, not just by latitude. Even at the equator, there may exist points with, and points without totality. That's since the shadow of the Moon isn't cylindrical, but a cone. And because the Earth isn't a plane perpendicular to the Sun - Moon axis. And the distance Moon - Sun is varying due to its orbit around Earth. 

Ultra-high energetic cosmic rays are thought to be caused by black holes as one option. Those energies should be sufficient for the formation of (hypothetical) heavy supersymmetric particles, which should decay to stable (hypothetical) neutralinos, candidates for (hypothetical) WIMPS. Assuming this theoretical framework, black holes (or similar dense objects) may cause the generation of dark matter. But the amount of dark matter formed that way won't explain the amount of dark matter needed for the Lambda-CDM model. Also dark matter forming this way should be hot (fast moving). Lambda-CDM needs cold dark matter (CDM). 

For galaxies it's difficult to determine their proper motions, but possible with the Very Long Baseline Array for nearby galaxies. For more distant galaxies (more than several megaparsecs), relevant for the determination of the Hubble constant, no direct measurements are available. An overall parallel motion relative to the majority of distant galaxies would be detected via redshift as radial motion when looking in any direction other than perpendicular to the motion. A proper motion of the majority of distant galaxies circling us as observer without or with the same radial velocity would lead over time to at least one compactification and one thinning, according to the hairy ball theorem ("Any smooth vector field on a sphere has a singular point.") This would be possible to be observed. Large-scale isotropy and homogeneity is in parts conjectural, but e.g. supported by the cosmic microwave background, although not quite undisputed. More about the cosmological principle. 

"At high altitudes, Neptune's atmosphere is 80% hydrogen and 19% helium" (Wikipedia). No significant abundancy of free oxygen to react with. A source of oxygen could easily made burn on Neptune, like a source of hydrogen on Earth. Or take a sample of Neptun's atmosphere. It would easily burn in Earth's atmosphere. Hydrogen oxygen combustion is sufficiently exothermic (483.6 kJ/mol of O2) to sustain burning even at the low temperatures on Neptune, provided the atmospheric pressure is high enough: With a gas constant of about 8.3 J / mol K, the gas can easily be heated up to the point of combustion by the energy released by the combustion. Assuming oxygen would be provided, just sufficiently to burn up hydrogen and trace hydrocarbons: After the explosion and condensation Neptune would get a huge ocean of water, later freezing to water ice, with an atmosphere of helium, and some less abundant gases like CO2, nitrogen, and argon, traces of water vapor. Traces of hydrogen and methane could survive the presence of oxygen. Hence some oxygen would remain in the atmosphere. Most of the CO2 would be resolved in the water ice. The average density of Neptune would increase, it would shrink a bit, the core would be compressed and heated by adiabatic compression. Before combustion Neptune's gravity is strong enough to hold an atmosphere of hydrogen, the easiest gas to escape. Hence the denser planet after combustion wouldn't improve its capability to keep an atmosphere significantly: The escape velocity of Neptune is 23.5 km/s, its surface temperature is below 100K. With Boltzmann constant $k=1.38\cdot 10^{-23}J/K$ and $E=3kT/2$ we get $$E=3\cdot 1.38\cdot 10^{-23}J/K\mbox{ or }4.14\cdot 10^{-21}J\mbox{ at }100K$$ for an average $H_2$ molecule with a mass of about $3.35\cdot 10^{-27}kg$. Hence for Neptun's escape velocity the kinetic energy of a hydrogen molecule is $$E=0.5\ mv^2=0.5\cdot 3.35\cdot 10^{-27}kg \cdot (23.5\cdot 10^3 m/s)^2 = 9.25\cdot 10^{-19} J.$$ Hence the energy needed to escape is more than 200-times the kinetic energy of the hydrogen molecules; no way to escape, 2000K or more would be needed to let escape some hydrogen over time (to get below a factor of about ten between the two energies). Photolyic dissociated atomic hydrogen would still need more than 1000K to escape. The probability to catch asteroids or comets would be reduced due to the reduced radius, if the total mass is adjusted to the mass before combustion, since asteroids would miss instead of hit the planet. 

Iron-nickel meteorites are made of metal alloys, either kamacite, or taenite. But I'm a little sceptical about whether it's a good idea to make a wedding ring of it, since it may oxidize over time, and it may contain toxic elements like cobalt, or it may cause nickel allergy. It's probably better not to use it for direct contact with skin, or humidity. However, etching it to reveal Widmanst√§tten patterns may look good. Better protect it from skin and air, e.g. by melting it into something like a glass containment. Account for different coefficients of thermal expansion between meteoric material and containment. 

You're actually describing the twin paradox. That's a little beyond Special Relativity, since the astronaut accelerates, and deaccelerates. Since Special Relativity treats only inertial frames of reference, accurate treatment would require some extension towards General Relativity. But you may consider two astronauts, one travelling with constant velocity towards Earth, the other one with the same (by amount) velocity away from the Earth, and then apply the formula for time dilation of Special Relativity to both astronauts, as an approximation, and to avoid the twin paradox. Then you get the almost ubiquitous factor $\sqrt{1-\beta^2}$ of Special Relativity, with $b=v/c$ the ratio of the relative velocity to the speed of light. For $\beta=0.1$, hence 10% the speed of light, we get a factor of $\sqrt{1-\beta^2}=\sqrt{1-0.1^2}=\sqrt{1-0.01}=\sqrt{0.99}\approx 0.9949874371$. Divide 10 years by 0.9949874371, and you get 10 years plus 18.4 days on Earth. For $\beta=1$ this division would fail, implying a break-down of the formulas of Special Relativity. That's why travelling with the speed of light doesn't work for astronauts respecting Special Relativity. 

I'd like to see the notion "parallel universe" restricted to universes similar to each other in some sense. This applies best to the many-worlds interpretation of quantum theory. Two universes in this sense can be almost identical, just different in a couple of quantum states. Two such parallel universes could be interpreted (in the simplest case) as two elements of a Hilbert space. A Hilbert space defines a metric as a measure of distance between two elements (here applied to universes). This may be seen in some analogy to points (universes as analog) in an Euclidean plane (many-worlds multiverse as analog). Here the notion "parallel" can make some sense. At least, it's possible to compare the items in some way (by the distance between two points/universes). Talking of universes as parallel in the very general case of items in a multiverse, when there is no similarity at all between these items, would be a bit too lax in my eyes. 

A surface gravity of logg = 4.72 means surface gravity equals $10^{4.72}\mbox{ cm}/\mbox{s}^2=52,480 \mbox{ cm}/\mbox{s}^2 = 53.5~g.$ This research has made use of the Exoplanet Orbit Database and the Exoplanet Data Explorer at exoplanets.org. CoRoT-3b on Wikipedia. 

You would be sliding, because the friction between you and Earth would be too weak, or else you wouldn't survive the acceleration, if the rotation of Earth would be changed abruptly. That's like crashing into a wall with several hundred mph. This is with the exception of close to the poles. Your weight wouldn't change much. On a smooth, plane, and horizontal surface you would slide (due to your inertia). Your velocity you would be sliding depends on your geographic latitude. At the equator it would be at the maximum. At the poles it would be zero. More precisely the velocity would be proportional to the cosine of the latitude (latitude 0 at the equator, and (+/-) 90 degrees, resp. $\pi/2$ at the poles). Even more precisely, the speed you would be sliding would be $$2\cdot 465.1~ m/s \cdot cos ~\varphi,$$ with $\varphi$ the latitude. Factor two, because superman accelerates to the opposite direction. Earth's equatorial rotation velocity is $465.1~m/s$. 

More about naturally occurring nuclides. This paper mentions the detection of a curium ion in cosmic rays. The process which forms curium can also form elements beyond curium, hence it's likely that there exist short-lived isotopes of elements in nature, which have not yet been detected. Research in this field is going on. 

They treat time dependent of the observer. For different observers on Earth variations are tiny, in many cases neglectable in comparison to measurement errors, although not for precision measurements. 

If you take a slowly rotating asteroid with a large basin of trapped water, some solved minerals, and may be some gases, close to the asteroid's surface, to get an environment similar to a black smoker by the heat of the sun, I wouldn't call it totally impossible. The formation of such an asteroid is close to the limits of my imagination, might be as a remnant of a comet with a crust of dust baked together to a water-proof surface layer. But that's pure speculation at the moment. May be we can learn more this year with Rosetta. Some biochemistry details: By the rotating asteroid part of the water undergoes a heating/cooling cycle. Provided there are enough prebiotic molecules, by this heating/cooling cycle kind of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) could multiply short occasional RNA or DNA fragments (nucleotide sequences). The difficult part is providing polymerase. It has originally been isolated from a bacterium living in hot springs, not quite dissimilar to black smokers. Information storage and replication (e.g. in RNA/DNA) is one important ingredient for life. Polymerase is an enzyme, mainly consisting of amino acids. Glycine is the first amino acid found in cometary dust in 2009. That's a first step, but there is a big gap. As an enzyme polymerase is a protein, hence can be encoded by RNA or DNA. To decode RNA to a proteine, kind of ribosome is needed. A ribosome itself consists of RNA and protein (chain of amino acids). That's the basics of the replication mechanism. Now we need a containment. The simplest form of a cell-like structure is a micelle. Organic molecules with a polar group can form micelles. This paper contains a list of organic molecules found in interstellar medium. Some of them could be used to synthesize appropriate molecules, but it's also quite a gap in this case. A long way from what we know of extraterrestrial organic molecules to a bacterium. 

I didn't read the SciAm article, but: Any cosmological theory compatible with "the" mainstream big bang theory doesn't assume material to have been contained in "Our Universe" (needs to be defined) from the very beginning. Instead a very hot, unified state, is assumed, which then underwent several symmetry breakings ($URL$ $URL$ before "material" came into existence, as we observe it by now. So, the very hypothetical, presumed four-dimensional star just needs to trigger an initial state causing the big bang. Whether "Our Universe" is a brane universe embedded in a higher-dimensional universe, is another mere hypothesis. Whatever "star" or "black hole" in a higher-dimensional universe would mean, the physics would be very different from the physics we can observe. For instance, inverse square laws wouldn't hold due to the additional dimension(s), hence orbital dynamics, electromagnetism needed for atoms, etc., all would either fail, or work rather different. Presuming the existence of stars in such a hypothetical universe is very daring, already.
