My dim memory of elliptic curves was that they were finitely generated abelian groups, but since they are uncountable that doesn't make any sense. Presumably I am thinking of their rational points. However, ℂn/Λ is always an abelian group, so I don't see what the fuss is about deciding when it is an abelian variety. It seems likely to me the group operations are different. 

Feit published his paper in the proceedings of the first Jamaican conference, MR1484185. He defines M(n,K) to be the group of monomial matrices whose entries are roots of unity. M(n,Q) is the group of signed permutation matrices. Theorem A: A finite subgroup of GL(n,Q) of maximum order is conjugate to M(n,Q) and so has order n!2^n except in the following cases... [n=2,4,6,7,8,9,10]. In all cases the finite subgroup of maximum order in GL(n,Q) is unique up to conjugacy. He notes that the maximum order subgroups of GL(n,Z) need not be unique up to GL(n,Z) conjugacy, since Weyl(Bn) and Weyl(Cn) are GL(n,Q) conjugate but not GL(n,Z) conjugate for n>2. Theorem B gives a similar result for the cyclotomic fields, Q(l). Feit published other papers which were very similar, and all of them rely heavily on Weisfeiler's work. However, I believe this is the only published account of his "here is the list" preprint. 

There appear to be a number of rational canonical forms. The best thing about standards is how many there are to choose from. However, the standard I choose seems to have a centralizer that is difficult to describe. 

A deleted question asked how to prove SL(3,C) acts irreducibly on the space of homogenous polynomials of fixed degree. I think it was deleted as a homework question, but it has never been a homework question at my university (at least not in the past decade), and so I thought it might be reasonable to try and work out these ideas in a setting that makes sense to me: Let K be a field of characteristic 0 and let SL(n,K) be the group of n×n matrices with entries from K and determinant 1. Let V be the K-vector space with basis the monomials xi of total degree w, where i = (i1,i2,...,in) is a multi-index with n entries, all non-negative integers whose sum is w. V has dimension w+1. SL(n,K) operates on V in the one true manner, by substitution of variables. In particular, for j = 2,3,...,n, the group SL(n,K) contains the elementary substitutions Ej which takes xj to x1+xj and takes xk to xk when j≠k. Define the lowering operator Lj as Ej−1, so it takes a polynomial f to the difference between Ej(f) and f itself. The L are called lowering operators because they lower the degree of f when considered as a polynomial in xj, though they hold the total degree constant. This can be checked by applying it to monomials. For any individual monomial, factor it as xja⋅xi where ij=0, then Lj(xja⋅xi) = (x1+xj)a.xi − xja⋅xi = ( (x1+xj)a−xja )⋅xi. The leading term, when considered as a polynomial in xj is then ax1xja−1xi, so it has degree a−1 in xj. If W is a submodule of V containing some nonzero polynomial f, then it must have nonzero degree in one of the variables xj. If any of these j are greater than 1, then apply Lj to transfer the degree from j to 1. Repeat until one is left with a⋅x1w. Since each Lj takes W to W and W is closed under division by nonzero scalars, we must have that any non-empty SL(n,K) invariant subspace of V contains x1w. In fact, we only use that it is closed under the maximal unipotent subgroup generated by the Ej. For instance, if n=3, then we can more simply write x1=x, x2=y, and x3=z. If w=4, and W contains xyyz+2xyzz, then apply L3 = Lz to get xyy(x+z)+2xy(x+z)(x+z) − xyyz+2xyzz = xyyx + 2xyxx + 4xyxz = 2xxxy + xxyy + 4xxyz. The total degree remained the same, but shifted from z to x, at the cost of increasing the leading coefficient. Applying Lz again, one gets the first two terms vanish, and one is left with 4xxy(x+z) − 4xxyz = 4xxxy. Applying Ly one gets the pure 4xxx(x+y)−4xxxy = 4xxxx. Notice that there were multiple paths we could have taken to move from f to xw. I think these paths are basically what are called "weights", and the lowering operators are called (simple, positive) "roots". Now we must recover all other monomials from this monomial, and so we define the raising operators. We begin with the elementary Fj in SL(n,K) defined by taking x1 to x1+xj and xk to xk for k≠j. The raising operator Rj is then Fj−1 which takes a polynomial f to the difference between Fj(f) and f itself. Rj sacrifices a degree in x1 to provide a degree in xj. Applying each Rj operator ij times to x1w we obtain a polynomial with nonzero xi term, but with a great many other terms that seem difficult to control. 

When n=2q is twice an odd prime power q, I think G = AGL(1,q) wr Sym(2) (amongst others) has the largest minimum orbit length on 2-sets. If G acts on Z = X ∪ Y, each of size q, then G has two orbits on Z(2), { {a,b} : a,b in X } ∪ { {a,b} : a,b in Y } of size 2⋅Binomial(q,2), and { {a,b} : a in X, b in Y } of size q2. When q is even, those are still the orbits, but of course AGL(1,2q) has only a single orbit. When n=3q is three times a prime power q coprime to 3, then again AGL(1,q) wr Sym(3) looks reasonable, with only two orbits, one of size 3⋅Binomial(q,2), one of size 3⋅q2. At any rate, if it is not maximal it has a fairly large minimal orbit. Obviously you can't keep taking Sym(k) for k=2,3,4,... forever, but I think actually it suffices to use the regular permutation representation Cyclic(k) of the cyclic group of order k. The largest orbit often splits into more than one orbit, but they are all so large it appears not to matter. In other words, you might try AGL(1,q) wr Cyclic(k) for fairly general k and q, when n=k⋅q. I think the minimum orbit size will always be the silly disjoint union one of size k⋅Binomial(q,2), which is pretty large as long as you hold k constant. You can probably replace AGL(1,q) with your paper's Γ(q,d) without too much trouble. I am under the impression that in asymptotic group theory, it is often quite hard to find exact sharp bounds, so just having "large" examples like these might be sufficient, at least for numbers with a very large prime power factor (so that k is kept small). 

I believe this means it would be difficult to understand how the scalars are embedded in my originally preferred canonical form unless b or d was quite small. It seems to me that when f is not separable, the matrix B still has the correct minimal polynomial, but that the various canonical forms need not be conjugate. In particular, for f(x)=x2−t over Z/2Z(t), it seems plausible that the companion matrix of f2 is not conjugate to the block diagonal matrix called "B" in this answer. 

Versions of most of these results are in Isaacs's book (page 28, 30, 84, 190, 212, 216), but I tried to include the 21st century versions where I found them. I would also caution against thinking "having an abelian subgroup of small index" as "close to abelian". Perhaps there is some truth to it, but the p-groups that are furthest from being abelian (maximal class, that is, having the largest nilpotency class possible amongst groups of the same order) also tend to have the largest abelian subgroups, often index p. Poor extra-special groups are nilpotency class 2 and nearly abelian (they are understood as symplectic vector spaces), yet their abelian subgroups are tiny, |A| ≤ p√[G:Z]. In other words extremely not-abelian groups may have large abelian subgroups, and extremely abelian groups may not. 

Maybe this part of the answer helps. It was sufficient for many tasks, but fails at some reasonable problems. A permutation action is a multi-set of conjugacy classes of subgroups of a group. The degree of the action is the total of the indices of representatives from each class (with multiplicity). The kernel of the action is the intersection of all the classes, or equivalently, the intersection of the normal cores of the representatives from each class. If you have a collection of subgroups, organize them into conjugacy classes, sort them by their normal core (first by size, then by actual subgroup). For each normal core (especially starting with the small ones), choose the largest subgroup (smallest index) with that core. These largest subgroups are your ingredients. Now roughly speaking try all combinations: compute the index and the kernel, and keep the best one, save any improvements to disk if you plan on letting this run for a while. If you don't have a collection of subgroups handy, then you need to use group-specific ideas to get yourself some. If the Fitting subgroup is small, then cores are unlikely to be a real problem, so you just want big subgroups that are cheap. For small (≤107 or so) groups, you can compute local subgroups pretty cheaply. If the Fitting subgroup is large or weird, then cores will be plentiful and weird or at least hard to avoid (a particularly awful situation is a unique minimal normal subgroup of order 2). In this case, one computes a full subgroup lattice. You can use recent versions of magma to get a fast answer, but be sure to read the changelogs to make sure you weren't affected by a missing subgroup. At any rate, in practice this method failed to handle some of the perfect groups in the perfect group library. Perfect groups with large Fitting can require very large permutation representations, but the theoretical lower bounds were often quite a bit lower than what I was able to achieve in practice. 

The basic question is whether there is a notion of chief factor of a connected solvable algebraic group that matches my intuition. A few smaller assertions are sprinkled through the explanation, and the implicit question is if these are correct (are unipotent groups nilpotent, are their chief factors all isomorphic to subgroups of Ga, etc.). In J.S. Milne's course notes on the basic theory of algebraic groups, theorem 14.30: A connected solvable smooth group over a perfect field has a connected unipotent normal subgroup whose quotient is of multiplicative type. In other words, the derived subgroup is contained in the unipotent radical. Now, a connected group acts on a group of multiplicative type trivially, by 13.21. I did not see it mentioned, but I believe unipotent groups are nilpotent in both the group theoretic sense and whatever fancy definition one might cook up for these functors. I think that the lower central factors should be direct products of subgroups of the additive group Ga. By the Jordan decomposition or 13.13 or 13.15, I think any action of Gm on (Ga)^n is diagonal. It looks like a connected solvable affine algebraic group over an algebraically closed field has a chief series consisting of subgroups of Ga and Gm, all of which I would describe as being one-dimensional. The analogy with finite groups takes the unipotent radical to be O_p(G), the p-core, and so it appears that a finite group of solvable algebraic type always has [G,G] <= O_p(G), so that not only is G supersolvable nilpotent-by-abelian, it is p-closed and its eccentric chief factors are all for the same prime p. In the algebraic case, the central chief factors would be the subgroups of Gm, and the eccentric chief factors would be the subgroups of Ga. In other words, connected solvable affine algebraic groups over algebraically closed fields are very dissimilar from finite solvable groups in that the representations they define on their own chief factors are all one-dimensional. More briefly, connected solvable affine algebraic groups over algebraically closed fields are supersolvable. Edit: I think the answer to my question is relatively simple: "supersolvable" is a little tricky to directly generalize, but "nilpotent-by-abelian" is quite easy and true, and still implies that any chief factors will be one-dimensional. In Jim's answer, it appears Borel-Serre-Mostow (at least by the time they are translated into Russian) also considered these groups to be "supersolvable", so the name is reasonable, even if the correct definition is just "nilpotent-by-abelian".
