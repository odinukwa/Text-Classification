In principle, this should prohibit any possibility of physicalist development. However, a literally understanding of his writings may lead to confusion because one can find in the book many statements like these: 

They depart apparently from his declared dualist position and evoke some questions about the mutual independency of the spirit and matter. To resolve this difficulty V.Delbos had proposed an interpretation based on the analysis of this book and of other Bergson's work, Time and Free Will (Essay): 

Objectives of any programming should be clearly determined, without ambiguities. Even if one uses a random number generator, its position in the code is not a random one and the programmer should know how, why and where use the generated numbers. Creation as objective has no such a determinacy. In many important cases - art, science or technology - this indeterminacy is due to the problem of the criterion - when is to stop and accept the result as some innovation? True innovation is a game-changer and it modifies rules that can be used in order to judge various values including its own. For example, when Planck had introduced a quantum hypothesis and Einstein had applied it in order to explain the photoelectric effect, this movement was without any value from the point of view of classical physics. However, what had happened from it resulted in a new physics, and now the initial innovation has a great value. Similarly, nobody could predict the appearance of jazz or rock music basing on the understanding of classical one, but they had changed the whole vision of the music. This means, that the rules do appear not early than the innovation appears. The programmer cannot in advance code those rules - they are absent. Who decides that the result is an innovation? I guess that the situation is looking like this: they switch on the computer, the code starts, then stops, writes down the result and they switch off it. Then they look whether the result is a creation or just a copy paste from the past. The "creator" does wish nothing, he has not initiated the creative process, he decides nothing and so on. In our practice, the creator starts the work, he decides when he can show it, he searches for recognition, and he promotes it and defends from critics. In the case of the computer creation, the programmers should perform all this authorship endeavor. This means that the creative work necessitates a conscious agency and a moral responsibility in order that the computer could insert him within the society and the latter accepts the author and its work. The computing is not a special kind of a physical process. In some sense, all physical processes, where one state follows from the previous one according to physical laws, can be considered as computing. So, why computers differ? I guess, there is an important anthropomorphic bias (or something similar) - machines' computing is very useful for us. Flowing river as a computing machine has no interest in our business, and we do not care about it and its complexity. We look in a special way on some physical entity because its functioning is useful. Why just by reason of this look this entity should transform itself in a conscious agent? 

The problem with this definition is that it proposes an empty list of possible conditions that can inhibit to bring about p (besides a lack of power) - whatever could they be. Thus, we cannot say where limits of the omnipotence are. I would say, that the author of the definition seems to reserve for himself the possibility to fill this list in a future. For now, nobody can judge from this definition which possible limits destroy the omnipotence and which of them leave it intact. 

Let me interpret this question in more general form through a first-person perspective. Somebody asks, "If I could do it, in which way I would arrange everybody's behavior and ways of thinking in order that nobody can disturb my life by its crimes or evil intentions?" This is the essence of the question, and such a quest of guarantees seems to be well justified. It is supposed in your text that the fear of a final judgment after death is a guarantee. For my opinion, in a secular society, where all such believes are put aside, things can be arranged in the next way. This question should be turned to that who asked it. Is she sure that her behavior would be also as good as she asked from others? If she does not believe in the life after death, she, probably, answer like this: "Yes, I am quite sure about myself, I will not commit any crime and nether will give way to my bad intentions, all this follows from my profound moral convictions". But, in this case, why she search for more than she can propose herself - her profound convictions without guarantees that she really has them (there is no ways to verify her personal views)? The schema follows from this consideration and supposes only good will. Everybody can declare her prosocial moral convictions and does not propose guarantees (it's impossible, so it's useless) that she indeed has them and in her turn does not ask others to give their guarantees. The question simply should not be even asked. 

I can propose an abstract consideration. A moral system is autonomous and its demands should be considered independently from factors or conditions that are external to the moral sphere. Here we see exactly the situation where this autonomy is violated: somebody pretends that he has an access to some special authority that in some sense places him above moral demands. This is unacceptable for the moral system and it does not permit him to proceed with his trick. I would say also that the very idea of the moral system that is ruled by some rational principles - like those mentioned in the proposed problem ("a certain set of properties to be subject to this theory") - is not true moral system: this schema means that the moral has no autonomy. In real life, personal moral judgment or decisions are formed somehow without referring to rational concepts and are rationalized a posteriori. For my opinion, this is an impasse. The person thinks he can escape the authority of the moral, the moral "thinks" that he is forever under its competence. 

I think it could be understood as if he applies the idea of locality to interactions of various parts of matter in the Universe. This idea he extends to the movement of celestial bodies. This quotation is from the Treatise on Light and other principal objects of the senses (The World and other writings, CUP, 2004) 

This means, that all the existence of a spirit or consciousness with all the phenomena is within the time, and if we try to concentrate or imagine this existence exclusively in the present moment, it dissolves completely. The matter, in its turn, is completely immersed in the present moment, and the time does not bring anything to its being: 

This is an extended commentary to the question. In the beginning of Matter and Memory Bergson clearly declares his dualism: 

You have only your our convictions and nothing more strong, therefore, they are only your mean in this case. If one does not think that all these doings are wrong you can only try to convince him that they are wrong. But you can fail. 

A subject thinks she knows somebody's name. However, when asked she cannot recall it immediately. After some efforts, the name is coming and she reports it. Normally, regardless this apparent difficulty to reproduce the word, we say about this situation "the subject knows this name". The subject has two numbers and is calculating their product (i.e. these are two sides of a rectangle and she is asked to find its area). In this situation, we do not say that the subject knows the product of two numbers until she has calculated it. 

Finally, he explains the gravity in the same way as sum of local interactions; the explanation is rather lengthy, this is just little piece of it: 

She contains a full model of the university that is informationally isomorphic to it. She herself should be a part of this model as a part of the university. This part is also equivalent to the university. And so on - infinite regression in models that are equivalent to the whole. Perhaps, this situation is OK – a familiar fractal behavior, but it looks very problematic. She can predict the state of the university after 1min. She arrives to this prediction in, say, 0.5min. However, when she runs her calculations she knows at 0.25min the state of the University at 0.5min; this means that at 0.25min she knows her answer that she delivers at 0.5min; this means that, in fact, she can deliver her answer in 0.25min. And so on, infinite regression. Therefore, the prediction does not need any time delay at all. The oracle is immediately ready to say everything about the University in whole its time existence - the oracle is informationally equivalent not only to the current moment state of the University, but also to all its states. Perhaps, one can say that this situation is OK – there are no contradictions; anyway, I find it very problematic. If the oracle machine, which predicts the situation after 1min and delivers this prediction in 0.5min, influences various decisions of the people and disturb her own prediction, she acts as a time machine that gives way for future effects affect their past causes. This means that the hypothesis about 0.5 min delay is wrong and the oracle can deliver her answer not early than in 1min, at that moment when it becomes useless. 

Anyway, from his point of view there is a principal obstacle to any possibility to reconstruct a conscious life from physical ingredients of the inert matter because the latter is alien to progression of the time. Therefore, it is hardly to imagine that Bergson was physicalist.
