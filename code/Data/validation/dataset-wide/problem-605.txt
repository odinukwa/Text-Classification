eBay is a good tool for determining value, search for your item selecting closed auctions and you often get a list of your item, bike in this case that has already sold (or not). The price of those transactions helps me determine relative value. Likewise craigslist shows you another view of what people are asking. If your target bike is being listed for less or more than your deal, you have more information. Sometimes you have to search outside your area to get a few hits, especially if your target bike is popular and scarce. Some other things to consider, is the person a 'dealer or private person who sells a lot of bikes'? Or, is it a person selling their own or a friend's bike? If possible, take the bike to your bike shop/mechanic and have them look it over. Just because it shifts right today does not mean the drive train is not worn out. Example, my Trek Nav looks like new, rides like a dream, but has 1500 miles on it and I'm pretty sure it needs a chain, cassette and who knows what else. Good luck! 

On the several occasions I've gone mountain biking, I was using a nice borrowed bike with full suspension and it felt nice. I'm told that rear suspension, though nice, is not necessarily a must-have. I have notions of the bike seat bludgeoning the ol' undercarriage without it. What is the ride like without rear suspension, what do I lose? And are there any suitable substitutes or ways to compensate for the lack of rear suspension? 

I'm somewhat new to the world of mountain bikes and I'm seeing various terms to describe different bikes. What is the difference between all-mountain, cross country, freeride, and downhill? Are they just marketing words or do they represent actual differences in the bikes (or maybe a bit of both)? Are there any other types of mountain bikes I missed? 

Late to this party but some good reading here! There are a couple of jewels in this thread. The math guy proving the weight of the bike might help 2-3% is priceless. As an overweight cyclist, when someone passes me going up a hill and they do frequently, a 10% increase in my speed wouldn't help me keep up. I'm doing 7, their doing 12, you figure it out. Then there is that comment by Lance saying it is easier to lighten the rider than the bike. So true. When I hit my goal later in the year, I'll have lost more than the weight of the heaviest bicycle out there. But here is the rub, newbies and guys like me trying to get fit and lose a few pounds are going to get messed up with this light is right stuff. Almost every light bike I've looked at drops the 1st chain ring and has little tiny tires and many even have missing spokes. My Surly LHT is a heavy bike and the reason I got this bike was for the gearing, it has a MTB crank set and cassette. I'm pretty sure it will climb a phone pole if you can keep the tires stuck to it. I ride in the 3rd ring most of the time but when I need to dump down, I need to dump down. We all agree, hills make the man (person). That leaves me with the tires and wheels, going from 26x2.2 to 700.37 indeed rolls easier, but those tiny racing tires are not something I'm ready for. Perhaps it is more between my ears than real, but my Continentals ride just fine, thank you on chipped granite, something we see around here. I cannot imagine hitting a pot hole with those little tires and half the spokes. While heavy, my LHT is a very smooth ride and having being professionally fitted, I am comfortable on 25 mile rides. You all agree the bike has to be fun to ride and for the new guy struggling to get fit, he needs to be fitted to the bike and he needs low gears if he is going to ride hills and overpasses or the bike will not be fun. 

At the risk of sounding like a bumpkin, why do I see some bikes sold without pedals or at least pictured without pedals? Is there some kind of benefit to buying pedals separately? Do some people take their pedals off the bike when not in use, like they might take off their wheels or seat post? 

Just to illustrate that there are better and worse ways to apply brakes, here's an example of a less-than-ideal way: I was biking on a borrowed bike and getting used to the brakes. The front brake lever was squishier than the rear. After skidding out and landing my hip on a stump, which lowered morale significantly for the next half-hour or so, I learned to give the front brake a harder squeeze to compensate for the squish. This was on a mountain trail and at the urging of my biking companion on that day. So my question is this: How does one brake under certain circumstances? Are there times when all-front or all-rear braking makes sense, or is it always best to apply pressure somewhat evenly to both brakes, and are there different braking techniques on roads vs trails and such? 

I fell and broke my ankle in 2011 and it took me a year to get back in the grove. I rode for another year and fell again this time requiring brain surgery. Both accidents happened getting on or off a good trail system. I'm just getting back into it again and like some said above, the only cure is riding again. As for your bike, take it to a good bike shop and tell them what's happening and tell them to check it out thoroughly. You could have nothing wrong at all or a bent/warped something as has already been suggested. Your bike should not feel squirmy or have any wiggle in it unless you are riding on soft or loose roadbed. Good luck. 

In the winter, on sand, slush and icy roads, 3 wheels are safer and thus can be ridden faster than the upright. Plus I've seen mini-windsheilds on cat-trikes that are quite popular around here. Riding comfort (your rear) will be better on the recumbent. In good weather the recumbent will, all things being equal,be a little slower than the upright, but the all-weather aspects of commuting sounds like a real plus to me. 

To ignore what may be a bad idea in terms of bicycle posture and address what seems to be central to your question, which is the reduction of flab, you need to know this about flab: You cannot spot-reduce. With the exception of liposuction. Your DNA determines where your fat ends up. You know how some ladies have normal upper bodies but have very large behinds? Yeah, you do. It's not because they're only active with their upper-half. If you have flab and then develop very strong abdomen muscles, you will have an awesome six-pack covered by flab. If you want the six-pack to show through, you have to lose the fat. Muscle tissue does not transform itself into fat tissue nor vice-versa. The only way to reduce flab in one area of the body is to lose fat period. @Carey Gregory already answered this as a comment but here it is as an answer. I'd recommend the excellent Why We Get Fat by Gary Taubes. Adiposity explained.
