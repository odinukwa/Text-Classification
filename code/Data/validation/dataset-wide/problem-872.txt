Eventually, yes. Interesting information about Venus: Venus is hotter than Mercury, despite being nearly twice as far from the Sun. Earth, despite being further from the Sun, receives more energy from the Sun than Venus, due to Venus's very high albedo. As you might guess by this information, the major factor that keeps Venus hot isn't how much energy it receives from the Sun, but rather its inability to rid itself of energy. While adding a cloud of some high albedo substance to the atmosphere may effectively prevent the Sun from heating Venus, it would also likely prevent infrared radiation from leaving Venus, thus keeping it warm. As you know, Venus already has a very high albedo. It's thick atmosphere prevents energy from leaving the planet, which is what caused the temperature to rise far above the Earth-like temperatures we believe it once enjoyed. This is caused by IR radiation being emitted from the surface and being reflected back down towards the planet by the atmosphere more detail, which plays an essential part in the greenhouse effect. In my opinion, a more effectual method in terms of making it habitable would be to find a way to drastically lower the albedo of Venus to allow all the excess energy to escape. 

You're close! What you built is a back-to-back set of Galilean telescopes (with an overall magnification of 1:1). The reason you're getting a smaller circle, but with a life-size image, is that the light bundles in the middle are diverging faster, and so you lose the edges if the Galilean assemblies are too far apart. Military perisopes use optical relays to get the image down the tube without blocking out any of the view. In simple terms, they have one relatively short-focusing group of achromatic/apochromatic lenses (called an Objective) to focus the light to a crosshair, like in a rifle scope. From there, the image is picked up by another long-focusing lens group called a relay. The relay re-collimates the light (but at low angles). The light is focused and collimated several times through the tube, until it reaches a final image plane, which is then looked at with an eyepiece (like you might have in a telescope). Overall, you can think of a periscope as a telescope/monocular/riflescope with relatively low magnification with several pairs of relays in between. A point of note, you need an even number of image planes (0, 2, etc) to avoid having an upside-down image. I can go into a lot more detail or provide some resources, but I think this most directly answers your question. Please let me know if there's any other questions on this. Source: I design optics for periscopes for naval applications. Edit for additional questions: First, the most comprehensive resource I found in my lazy search is this page: $URL$ which is actually written by a previous engineer at my company. There's a ton of information there, mostly intended for people who already know about optical design, but there's probably a good amount you can get from it as well. To the question in your comment: in your preliminary design, the positive and negative lenses are taking collimated light input, and outputting collimated light. However, since they are acting as a telescope with magnification power, the angle of the rays coming out is wider than the angle going in (by a factor equal to your magnification). The trick to a relay lens design (used in periscopes and some kinds of endoscopes, as well as other applications) is to get the collimated spaces short enough that you don't lose that light before it spreads out. Or more accurately, that you get the angles of the collimated light to be small enough that you can spread out your lenses quite a bit while still maintaining this condition. Regarding field of view: you're absolutely not stuck with a small FOV. That depends entirely on the focal length of your objective. A short focal length lens as your objective will give you a wider field of view (so long as your light isn't clipped by your top mirror). You could also have an objective that changes focal length (a zoom lens) to change your field of view as desired. For your application, an SLR camera lens could work quite well for this. Regarding tube length: You could vary the spacing in the sections where the light is collimated. This will impact how much light is being lost from it spreading out too much (typically limited by whichever section is longest). The result will be a dropoff in the relative illumination (how bright the edge of the FOV is compared to the center). This is an effect known as vignetting, and can be mitigated, but not without tradeoffs. 

It would appear theoretically possible (to some degree) through extreme applications of recycling to trigger mass shedding in pulsars. Pulsars are rapidly spinning neutron stars, the fastest class of which are millisecond pulsars. The current belief is that they build up rotational speed through accretion, a process known as recycling. One study, Recycling Pulsars to Millisecond Periods in General Relativity (Cook, et al), explores the limitations of this process. The following chart shows their results: 

Well, it would be useful to define what a 'dead' galaxy is. Probably the most simple method would be a galaxy that is no longer producing new stars. We might also consider a galaxy that no longer produces significant light in the visual spectrum, or perhaps EMR across the entire spectrum. Generally, there's unlikely to be a firm line between living and dead, and not nearly as dramatic as larger stars. More akin to watching a camp fire burn itself out. Star formation is largely dependent available gases, but as more and more stars fuse those gases into heavier elements, there is less gas available for star formation. For your average sized galaxy, this will eventually result in running out of gas. Eventually the galaxy will dim and go dark, a process purported to begin at the center of the galaxy, where star formation is heaviest according to research based on Hubble images of giant galaxies. (Tacchella, et al.) The matter ought to (mostly) all still be there and still orbiting the (presumed) SMBH, but with no energy coming from fusion, it's going to be a dark, cold, and barren place. Sounds dead to me. There are some complicating factors. It's believed that encounters with nearby galaxies can affect available gases. The gravity from a larger galaxy could potentially strip the gases from a smaller one, a fatal blow for the smaller galaxy. Fortunately, it won't suffer much as the death will come (relatively) quickly. This process has been deemed 'strangulation' by a study published in Nature several years months days ago. (Ping, et al.) Note that as the study indicates, the methods of death are proposed solutions - not conclusive understanding of the exact processes that result in a galaxy's death. 

I generally agree with the answer above, but have a couple more insights which might help you if you decide to proceed with trying to make your own scope... The lens pairs that James mentioned (crown and flint) are known as a doublet. Glass has two key properties in play here - its index of refraction (how much it bends light) and its dispersion (how much that bending changes over color). The lens pair balances a strongly convex crown (low index and low dispersion) with a weakly concave flint (high index and high dispersion). The dispersions are designed to cancel out, while you want the curvature of the convex crown to overpower the concave flint in terms of index, so it still has some ability to focus. The design also inherently lends itself toward long focal lengths which are desirable in telescope objectives. Eyepieces, due to their short-desirable focal lengths necessitate more lenses which allow you to balance the chromatic aberration, and also address other optical aberrations which come into play with such a short focal length (distortion, astigmatism, coma, and spherical aberration being the main concerns). There are well-established design forms which are often used for making well-corrected eyepieces, some of which can be found right on wikipedia: $URL$ One thing to consider, which I don't think has been mentioned is selection of focal lengths and apertures. A 5cm aperture is plenty sufficient to view the Galilean moons, and probably some bright DSOs if you're well-corrected, and if your focal lengths are well-chosen. The system magnification is the ratio of focal lengths between the objective lens and eyelens/eyepiece. (200cm/2.2cm = 90.9x). This means that something like the Galilean moons, which have a max extent of about 1/8 degree, would be magnified to have an apparent extent of 11 degrees (much easier to resolve). Your aperture selection (particularly of your objective) will determine the light-gathering ability. But the magnification applies here too, so if you have a 5cm objective at 91x, your "exit pupil" will only be 0.55mm diameter, which is tiny compared to your eye's aperture. You'd still be able to see the object, but your eyes will easily accommodate up to a 30cm objective aperture (3mm exit pupil). Keep in mind, there is a tradeoff between aperture and aberrations, so unless you're designing a very well-aligned 2- or 3-element objective, you may want to stick with a max objective aperture of 50-75mm. In terms of alignment, don't just set the lenses a certain distance apart and expect to see an image. You will need to allow for some adjustment, which is probably easier looking at a distant object during the day. After you form an image, you may need to adjust the centration and tilt of the eyelens to form the sharpest image to optimize your alignment. All that said, a small aperture, high-end refractive (glass) telescope can perform better than a reflective telescope of the same aperture. But as aperture increases, the cost of the materials and impact of aberrations makes refractive telescopes vastly inferior to reflective (mirror) telescopes. Since the design for these only necessitates 1 powered mirror and an off-the-shelf eyepiece for $50 or less, the best bang for your buck will definitely be a reflective telescope. Sorry if that's not what you're hoping to hear, but it's why most telescopes on the market today are reflective. 

It's poetically called The Old Moon in the New Moon's Arms. Project Earthshine used measurements of the brightness of the non-sunlit portion of the moon to accurately determine earth's albedo: 

If you've moved to an area with major aircraft traffic, you may be seeing fewer stars due to cirrus cloud formation. Such clouds are often subtle enough not to be visible as clouds but still block out starlight. For example: Forecasting Andean rainfall and crop yield from the influence of El Niño on Pleiades visibility 

There are apps which will help guide you to more significant stars (Google skymap comes to mind if you're looking for a simple mobile system - Stellarium may also be a good option), but it's highly unlikely that any app will include the location and names of so-called 'personal' stars, as the bodies who sell such things don't have any the authority to do so and are not generally recognized in the actual world of Astronomy. Note that the IAU (International Astronomy Union) is the body generally recognized to have the responsibility of naming and classification of stars and other bodies. They also come out strongly against such practices and services: 

It depends on the telescope. If the telescope is fully reflective (no transparent glass elements), it should be able to operate well-beyond visual wavelengths, with its transmission limited primarily on your mirror costing material. $URL$ Any telescope with refractive (transparent glass) elements however, will quickly lose performance outside of the visual range due to transmission, but also from how the glass index changes with wavelength, which causes non-visual light to be defocused (an effect which increases the further you get from visual wavelengths). Generally speaking, the defocused issue of refractive telescopes can be compensated if you have enough focus travel. You will see "chromatic aberration" becoming much more significant very quickly, as telescopes are only designed to correct this over visual wavelengths. Ultimately, the limiting factor of refractive telescopes is the transmission of the glass in the lenses. Many glasses will transmit reasonably well from 400-2000nm, though some have worse performance and some have better. 

Most photographs you will see of the Milky Way are long exposure photographs (often around 30 seconds exposure, whatever the limit is before star trails become noticeable at their focal distance; sometimes longer if they use a tracking mount) at a very wide aperture. This is done to capture the maximum amount of light and, in fact, capture far more light than your eyes can capture. It also usually takes a little adjusting to colorize the Milky Way the way we expect it to be colored. Note, that this doesn't mean the photos aren't real - if you define photos' realism by representing exactly what people see, then no photo has ever been real. While you may not be able to see the Milky Way to this degree, you can still go out and see her. As others described, consider your location and time of year, take care to find a dark spot with clear skies and give your eyes enough time in the dark to adjust. 

Your radio information source is wrong. The Large Hadron Collider has not discovered mini black holes. When it comes back on line this spring, the LHC will begin looking for mini black holes: Large Hadron Collider Could Prove the Existence of Star Trek's Parallel Universe Journalists do like their headlines, but the gist is this: 

Pretty thin soup. Sodium and potassium get kicked up by photons hitting the surface. There's also argon, helium and other minor components. As shown in this figure from the first link: The sodium in that atmosphere does glow; (Rayleigh unit definition). At least some of the glow is due to full fledged ions rather than charge-neutral fluorescence:
