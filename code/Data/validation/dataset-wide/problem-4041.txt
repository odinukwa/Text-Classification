The best known examples are the cubic threefolds and the quartic double-solids (that is, double covers of $\mathbb{P}^3$ branched along a quartic). In general, this works for quadric bundles, see Beauville's paper. 

More specific than Ilya's answer. To see that the intersection of two subbundles need not be a bundle, take, on your space $M$, the rank two trivial bundle $M\times \mathbb{R}^2$. Then take two line bundles $L=(m,x,0)|m\in M, x\in\mathbb{R}$ and let $K$ be a nontrivial line bundle contained in $M\times\mathbb{R}^2$ such that the fiber over some point $m_0$ is the $y=0$ line. Then away from that point, the intersection will be just the origin, however, at $m_0$, the intersection is a rank 1 vector space. Thus, the dimension can jump, and so you don't get an actual vector bundle, merely a family of vector subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^2$ parameterized by $M$. And for this, all we need is some manifold which has a nontrivial subbundle of $\mathbb{R}^2$. 

The homomorphisms in the category of sheaves are not sheaves themselves. The hom sheaves have the data of things that are only homomorphisms over open subsets. So if $Y,Z$ are coherent $\mathcal{O}_X$-modules and you are looking for $\mathcal{O}_X$-module homomorphisms, you don't actually get $\mathcal{H}om(X,Y)$, what you actually get are the global sections only, because these are the only homomorphisms that are defined on the whole space, and so the only actual homomorphisms in the category of sheaves. 

So, any line bundle $L$ on an abelian variety $X$ determines a type $(d_1,\ldots,d_g)$ where $d_i|d_{i+1}$. It's well known that if $d_1\geq 3$ then $L$ defines an embedding, that if $L$ has no fixed components, $L^{\otimes 2}$ is very ample, and for $d_1=2$ we have base point freeness. What about the case where $d_1=1$? Certainly it's not always base point free, for instance, in the case of a principal polarization. But what about nonprincipal polarizations? Are there any known criteria for determining if they are base point free or not? And if there is a base locus, for determining it (which presumably requires knowledge of $L$, not just the type of $L$)? The only result I can find in this direction is that for an abelian surface with a $(1,d)$ polarization, we have no base points for $d\geq 3$ and for $d=2$ we have exactly 4 base points, but what about higher dimensional $X$? EDIT: As pointed out below, I want to assume that $X$ is simple. 

Now, additionally, these period domains often can be quotiented by a discrete (I believe Griffiths says arithmetic) subgroup of the original group to actually get a variety. For instance (if I'm understanding right) if we take $\mathfrak{h}_g=Sp(g)/U(g)$ above, we can quotient further by $Sp(g,\mathbb{Z})$ and this gives us $\mathcal{A}_g$, the moduli space of abelian varieties. 

Let $f:X\to Y$ be a proper morphism of normal varieties (smooth as DM stacks, but I only care about the coarse spaces). The map $f$ is generically finite, but not flat (so no hope of smoothness and Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch applying) and I have a fairly detailed understanding of the fiber over any point, images of $f$ restricted to divisors and so forth. Now, take a divisor $D$, and identify it with an invertible sheaf in the standard way. I'm looking for a way to compute the first Chern class of $f_*D$ on $Y$. 

As for the Ricci flow bit, Ricci flow does it. I sketch the proof in high genus here, and here's the paper that that post is based on. So, this may not be quite what you want (and it needs patching in genus 0, and is much harder in the non-hyperbolic cases) but it proves uniformization through Ricci flow, which seems to be what you speculated might be sufficient. 

You might want to look up some things about index theorems (particularly Atiyah-Singer). They tend to relate topological and geometric data, so you can put geometric data in and topological data out. 

The axiom of choice may give you a map $u:C\to B$ as SETS. However, it may not be a morphism in the category of $R$-modules. 

My favorite example is regular polytopes. The number of regular polytopes is almost monotone decreasing, from countably many in $\mathbb{R}^2$, to five in $\mathbb{R}^3$ to 3 for $\mathbb{R}^n$ for $n>4$. But in $n=4$, we get six, which is kind of weird. 

Modular forms of weight 1/2 are actually quite prominent in geoemtry (I can't speak for number theory). For instance, the 2nd order theta functions (which encode information about points of order two on abelian varieties, for instance) are of weight 1/2. They give a natural and important map from a certain cover of the moduli space of abelian varieties (specifically $\mathcal{A}_g^{(2n,4n)}$) into projective space which is injective for $n\geq 2$. Here are a few reference for 2nd order theta functions: Kummer varieties and the moduli spaces of abelian varieties - van Geemen and van der Geer Igusa's book on Theta Functions Mumford's Tata Lectures on Theta. Grushevsky's survey of the Schottky Problem (lots of things on the Schottky problem involve 2nd order theta functions)

I'm not entirely sure what you mean, but if you mean whose complement isn't principal, take $\mathbb{A}^2\setminus\{0\}$ which is an open subscheme of $\mathbb{A}^2$. Now, if you mean that the open subscheme isn't cut out by a single equation, any open subscheme other than the whole space will do for an irreducible scheme, because the only open set which is cut out by an ideal is the whole scheme. 

Every nonhyperelliptic genus 3 curve is a smooth plane quartic. The plane quartics form a projective space. Apply GIT to this projective space and the $PGL(3)$ action. Prove that this quotient is rational. 

Every nonsingular variety over $\mathbb{C}$ is a smooth manifold, period. Take any affine open cover $X=\cup U_i$. Then each $U_i$ is a smooth manifold, and the transition maps are algebraic, so in particular, smooth. Thus, manifold. 

One of the best places I've found for the stuff (and it does tend to apply to the applications of categories to logic, but there's enough other stuff that it's worthwhile) is Lawvere and Rosebrugh 's "Sets for Mathematics." It does assume that you're ok with sets, and then does lots of categorical constructions with sets, and attempts to study the category of sets itself, where you have some intuition and know how to construct things (like products, coproducts, equalizers, etc). Now, it is intending to get to topoi, though most of the book is fine for just getting the categorical language, and applying it to sets. 

I would interpret things like "has richer structure than just X" to mean that there's more there that you get for free, in some sense. For instance, in your example, the set of solutions to a system of polynomial equations at first seems to just have a cardinality, which is the only thing you can say automatically about a set. However, in this case, it's not just any set, by virtue of being solutions to some polynomial equations over a ring, it has a structure of a scheme (variety if the ring is a field and the equations are nice) where, without making any choices at all, we can make it into something more than just a set. In some cases (elliptic curves) the structure is yet richer, and is in fact also a group in a natural way. At the least, things like this are how I generally hear the phrase used. But generally it's used informally to say that something is more interesting than a random object that looks like it at first glance, or that an object is very interesting (richness of structure of the absolute Galois group) and in nontrivial ways. 

Hironaka in fact says that you can resolve singularities by a sequence of blow ups, and the universal property of blowing up is that the exceptional locus is a Cartier divisor. So in fact, the exceptional locus of the whole thing will be a Cartier divisor. Making sure that the exceptional locus is a snc divisor is called "embedded resolution" and is also known to be true. This is covered by Koll√°r in this book, which I believe is an expanded version of these notes, but also pretty much everywhere else that proves resolution of singularities. 

Not necessarily, I don't think. There are surface singularities (though I can't recall an example easily, but one whose resolution has exceptional divisor an elliptic curve) for which if you blow up at a point you get a singular curve. The example I'm thinking of is in Kollar's Exercises. In the case I'm thinking of, you have a surface with a single point singularity, you blow it up, and you get a rational curve singularity, which if you blow up (or normalize, either one) gives you an elliptic curve over it. EDIT: found it, it's exercise 68, do all three parts to see some of the things that can happen. 

I can't give much in the way of details, but I remember reading that one of the major flaws in the Italian school and their work on surfaces was that they kept using "generic points" without definition in a lot of their proofs, and that that hole was patched by the theory of schemes adding exactly the points they needed. 

Now, among algebraic geometers, at least, it is well known that there is an equivalence between locally free O_X-modules of rank n and vector bundles of rank n. So, equivalently, principal GL(n,C)-bundles are given by locally free sheaves of rank n. So...what about other groups? I guess that SL(n,C) bundles are then locally free sheaves of rank n with top exterior power trivial, but can we phrase everything in terms of the properties of a sheaf and a group? My guess is that in this context, if we can do it, we'll end up with something that's not quite locally free sheaves of rank n for GL(n,C), but which will be equivalent. Note: I'm aware that we could just say something like "the sheaf of local sections of a G-bundle" but I'm looking for something intrinsic, a set of properties of the sheaf without reference to the geometric bundle, which can be reconstructed from the sheaf description. 

Not sure if this is appropriate to Math Overflow, but I think there's some way to make this precise, even if I'm not sure how to do it myself. Say I have a nasty ODE, nonlinear, maybe extremely singular. It showed up naturally mathematically (I'm actually thinking of Painleve VI, which comes from isomonodromy representations) but I've got a bit of a physicist inside me, so here's the question. Can I construct, in every case, a physical system modeled by this equation? Maybe even just some weird system of coupled harmonic oscillators, something. There are a few physical systems whose models are well understood, and I'm basically asking if there's a construction that takes an ODE and constructs some combination of these systems that it controls the dynamics of. Any input would be helpful, even if it's just "No." though in that case, a reason would be nice. 

Given a curve C, and a reductive group G, there is a moduli stack Loc_G(C), the stack of G-local systems. I keep reading that there's a substack of "opers" but am having trouble locating a definition. So what's an oper, and how should I think about them? 

Not lecture videos or anything, but the stuff from Oliver Labs is very good for just illustrating geometric stuff, like blowups and dual curves. 

Ok, ignoring my deleted answer where I misread the question, I don't have a full solution (working on some details), but to extend the functor you describe much beyond actual, literal varieties over C, you'll need to handle the case of Spec(k[x]/x^2), which has the property that a map from it to a variety is a tangent vector, so you'll need to find some set S such that hom(S,V), as sets, has a map for every tangent vector to V, for any V. I don't see how to satisfy it, but I've not yet got a proof that you can't, and it doesn't say anything about functors not being the forgetful functor on C-varieties, though it gives a possible way to show that it can't extend much. 

Let $f:X\to Y$ be a degree $d$ morphism of complex projective varieties, and let $V\subset Y$ an irreducible subvariety, $W$ its preimage under $f$. I want to find all of the components of $W$. Suppose that I've already found several components, $W_1,\ldots,W_k$, and the components that are known are such that the sum of the degrees of the maps $f|_{W_i}$ adds up to $d$, and I know that there exists at least one component where the map restricts to one that isn't finite. How can I determine if there are any other components of this nature, that don't contribute to the degree of $f$? And if they exist, is there a good way to identify what they are? (Note: this is an attempt to redo a question I asked a few days ago and deleted, hopefully, this is better phrased. Roughly, I'm looking for ways to find all the components of the preimage of a variety through a morphism as described above) 

Algebraic Geometry: Bezout's Theorem. It's also good for selling what algebraic geometry is to people who've never heard of it before. 

In particular, are quotients of $\mathbb{P}^n$ by $PGL_k$ rational, under some reasonable hypotheses? Are there any natural invariants that are preserved by quotients (again, with reasonable conditions, or of the above form)? 

This is false. Let $K=\bar{\mathbb{Q}}$ and $L=\bar{\mathbb{F}}_2$. These are clearly both algebraically closed, of different characteristics, so $K\not\cong L$. However, if we ONLY look at the topology, $\mathrm{Spec}(K[x])$ and $\mathrm{Spec}(L[x])$ will be be countable sets with the finite complement topology on the closed points, with a single generic point, so they're homeomorphic. For algebraically closed fields, the TOPOLOGY on the affine line over the field is determined by the cardinality. For higher dimensions, it's less clear to me, because you might be able to recover characteristic (I'm a char 0 kind of person, so I don't know) from how the various curves/hypersurfaces sit inside it. 

(This is not really intended as an answer, but was too long to fit as a comment) You're very unlikely to find what you're looking for. Non-smooth is just that, not smooth. So a non-smooth function is just one that doesn't have infinitely many derivatives. If you assume continuous non-smooth functions, then you have precisely the open set definition. If you want some derivatives, then you're looking at $C^k$ functions, which have $k$ continuous derivatives. These have various properties, but smoothness and differentiability depend on structure beyond topological. As for "scaling" symmetry, what exactly do you mean by that? There's a scaling "symmetry" for homogeneous functions of a given degree, by $f(\lambda x)=\lambda^d f(x)$, but nothing of the sort really for an arbitrary function, smooth or nonsmooth. 

I would say that the book you're looking for is probably "The Geometry of Schemes" by Eisenbud and Harris. It is very concrete and geometric, and motivates things well (though I don't think it does so in quite the detail of proving that a topological space is Hausdorff iff $X\to 1$ is separated, but I believe it does discuss separatedness and why it is good and why it captures the intuition of Hausdorff space)
