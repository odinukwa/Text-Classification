When I go trail-clearing I generally carry two machetes and a felling ax, but I haven't found a practical way to sling them so I can work with one without taking off the other tools. The machetes have cordura sheathes with loops, and the ax has a leather bit sheath with a loop. I have this feeling that people who do this for a living must have clever carrying rigs or slinging techniques so they don't have to drop everything whenever they need to take a whack at something. Are there any ways to carry or rig tools like this so: 

Press moistened paper into the target container, which can be a box of any sort. The paper should be wet enough and pressed hard enough that at least a little bit of water is squeezed out upon pressing. You don't have to wait for it to dry to shoot it. The advantage of pressing wet paper hard is that you can eliminate density variations and pockets. E.g., you won't find the arrow penetrating 2" in one spot but 6" (or worse) in another. Create a laminate target by stacking the paper/cardboard and then compressing and strapping/taping the back of the stack. By shooting into the ends a target like this can last a long time because, ideally, the arrows are stopped primarily by friction as they slide between two sheets and get squeezed to a stop. This is the concept behind the popular "Block" targets, which use layered foam. 

There ain't no way man...As Mr. Miyagi would say, "the best defense against a would be car vandal is no be there." I propose a different solution than others would: I never have that problem because I do not park at trailheads. We have been known to pull our 1999 Toyota Corolla off the dirt road we were on ( another tip: find those dirt roads! ) and cover it up, even if it meant building a small lean to over it. Since we were already driving in a very deserted area not turning off a major highway and into a crowded trailhead we would just camp close to the car and we have never had a problem. Sometimes, I bike to the trailhead after parking in Walmart's heavily watched parking lot a mile or so away. Or, I sometimes leave the car at home and bike all the way. Yea, down the trail and off of it too a good mountain bike will go. 

Hmmm, people with no real experience, no cardiovascular fitness, no strength to lug a pack around, no navigational skills, I would say heck no. The first time we did it we almost bought the farm, got lost with no gear, no winter protection and we were only a bit more than a mile away from town. It was not our fault, the Ranger gave us wrong directions and sent two newbs through the forest with less than an hour of sunlight left. A forest with bears, rattlers and gators. The point is, the unexpected happens to those who are not prepared. They should not be using their first experience for training. Trial and error, that is not the way to go out there. Have they watched the necessary vids on youtube? Are they members here? Your training begins and ends at home in safety, because if you can not do it there you can not do it anywhere. Does this group know how to stay together, how not to panic if they see a bear? Do they know how to walk around without injuring themselves? How to avoid snakes? Nights get cold in the forest, it was 73 in the day and 38 that night that day. Easy to lose the trail, easy to lose the rest and be stranded. First timers have no idea what it is like, I suggest take em down a well known trail, walk them down it for about an hour or maybe and a half and then bring em right back to the car and home. That should be more than enough. Just in case you decide to not follow any of my recommendations the number one thing I can say that you should make sure everyone carries is water! Most first timers will try to get by on 20 ounces of water... Let me tell you this, there is no worse hardship then being short on water. Make sure everyone carries a gallon of it. Then comes the pain of carrying it. Good luck! 

In order to prevent people from putting the high-pressure rounds in a gun not designed for them, the cartridge case was lengthened just enough (0.135") that, properly loaded, it would not fit in the cylinder or chamber of a gun designed only for .38 Special. But take a .357 Magnum round, dump a bit of powder* (or use the same charge as you load in .38 Special), and you're essentially back to a .38 Special in a slightly longer case. Shooting .38 Specials in a .357 Magnum can lead to one small problem: Because the .38 case is slightly shorter, you'll get chamber or cylinder fouling a little further back. If you shoot a lot of dirty ammo and then, without cleaning, try to feed .357 Magnum back into the same gun, you might find rounds getting stuck on that ring of fouling. Another tiny caveat: There are some .357 Magnum autoloaders out there. If they're tuned for the recoil impulse of the magnum they may fail to cycle on the lower recoil of the .38 Special. Of course, as with any gun you intend to use for hunting or defense, you should test fire the gun with the ammo you intend to carry to ensure they work together without malfunctions before taking them into the field. 

We use both. It is not difficult to light a fire with a ferrocerium rod especially if you have pine trees around as we do. A bit of sap from one of them on your shavings, cotton balls, spanish moss and one strike from the rod will start the fire. No sap? Then we also carry a small jar of vaseline. Both are overkill but help when you must light a fire in the pouring rain or high humidity. Small shavings can be made on site and charcloth is also usable with a firestick. Two is one and one is none...Equipment fails under special conditions and that is why we do not skimp on firestarting ways. We have started fires using a magnifying lens which we needed when the guy carrying the firemaking tools decided to fall into the lake and drench our equipment. Only the firesteel and the magnifying glass worked then. They are also a lot of fun but recommend watching a video or two to see the proper hand motions. Keep the stick when striking (scraping is the correct word), right on top or in the target. All of which you have probably done by now. 

I literally stuck myself on a discarded hypodermic needle once as an adult, in Rome, through the side of the shoe when I was wearing light "training" shoes; connversely when I was younger than that (a teenager) and used to walk barefoot, I would watch where my feet are going. I had no ill-effect from that incident, though, luckily. In Toronto it's normal to see signs on shops saying, 

My experience as a cyclist is that getting wet doesn't matter (because skin is waterproof): what matters is getting cold. So the goal is to stay warm enough. Your warmth is affected by your exercise (producing heat) and insulation/clothing (retaining heat). To keep warm, keep exercising: if you stop and take shelter (when already soaking) then you'll get cold[er]. It may be better to keep on keeping on (even in the wet) until you reach an indoor shelter. In dry weather you might keep your jacket unzipped (to stay cool and avoid sweating); if you're drenched in rain, staying cool and sweat-free is less important, instead you might zip up to keep warm. 

I carry a smaller pocketknife for cutting cord, doing some whittling when I am shaping wood, tent stakes for instance. I carry a big 8 incher for use as a machete, for splitting small logs, for general protection, for cutting meat, cleaning fish, shaving bark for fuel. We also carry some throwing knives, although I am pretty accurate with all my knives I generally use them to pass the time with practice. Some people have told me that the only tool they really need is a sharp knife,,, 

When I am walking in a city such as NYC or Las Vegas, I do not look down. I am looking right and left for cars, people and dark alleys. But I think you are correct when in the wild to look down more than other places. As Cody Lundin says foot placement is very important. When stepping on rocks, up and over logs, in and out of mudholes and through high grass, you just have to know where you are placing your feet. There is only one way to know, you travel slowly and deliberately and do not place your feet in any spot that you have not looked at first. Sure, that means cutting your speed down but I do not see any other way. We hike in pairs so that the front guy checks the ground out and generally only looks 15 to 20 ft ahead. He is clearing the way for the guy behind him who scans the trees and listens, getting an overview. Depending on where you are of course we do not relax and smell the coffee until we reach the destination. If you want to look around and enjoy nature, stop! We never do that moving.
