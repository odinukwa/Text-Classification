The core American interests in the post-colonial era -- which is anchored in the founding of the UN and the emergence of so many new nation states -- remain trade and the ability to have some influence in regions all over the world. America is engaged globally because it trades globally. (America's experiment as a colonial power was fairly brief -- late 1890's to the end of WW II). While China was in the Cold War era an ideological and political rival to America, since the early 1990's that inter-power rivalry has changed to include an increasingly commercial character. (For some background on how the US became a power, and its role in the late 20th century as a hegemon, I recommend Walter Russell Meade's "Special Providence." Short answer: international trade has been a core national interest since the US was a colony of the English Crown. That has not changed, and has increased in importance over time). Why is the "colonial" tag irrelevant? Because the year is 2016. In the generation after the UN was founded (from about 1945 to about 1975) dozens and dozens of previous colonies emerged as nation states in their own rights, and as UN members. (As you note, the Philippines in 1946). Of course, this didn't happen in a vacuum. Relationships with previous colonial powers sustained to one degree or another -- such as in Francophone West Africa or among Commonwealth nations -- but in some cases underwent profound changes like the French/Viet Nam relationship, or how Angola and Mozambique profoundly broke with the Portuguese as much as the Portuguese broke with them. After President Aquino's government invited the Americans to leave in 1991, and after the bases closed, the relationship changed in character from blatantly "paternalistic" to "someone we've had a relationship with for a long time." The Philippines are but one player in the SCS resource issue. You are better off viewing the issue from the PoV of the local nations: Malaysia, Indonesia, Viet Nam, Philippines, Brunei, etc. What are their interests, and how do they pursue them? For whatever reason, you have chosen to try and see this through a US centric lens. What are the core interests of the US in the South China Sea? 

They weren't afraid to try It really is that simple. Having read the answers so far, I feel that in some ways the point is being missed. There is a fundamental human interaction that I'll paraphrase this way: if you walk into a room and act like you are in charge, you are until someone proves that you are not. I don't know if I have any Frankish ancestors, mostly my line comes from Danes, Yorkshiremen, Germans, Hungarians, Serbs, and we think a bit of Swiss. But that little point boils down to: 

It seems to have worked as a philosophy for the Franks and their successors the Normans. (I mean, really? The Normans took over the Kingdom of Naples and the two Sicilies?) I don't think it is all that complicated. Atilla the Hun, one can argue, succeeded under a very similar philosophy, and look at how well he did. 

Given the development and use demonstrated by at least one side, it is reasonable to conclude that such a strategy was on the table for the first few decades of the Cold War. While I don't have a source for the USSR side, the development of nuclear, chem, and bio weapons, and plans to use them on both sides suggests that both sides left the options open to use them, and had plans in case they chose to. (Defoliants/herbicides are a sub set of bio warfare). The Soviet biological warfare program dates to the 1920's, and there was a herbicidal component to that program as well as the disease spreading program. it is interesting to note that President Ngo Dinh Diem of South Vietnam (in 1961) asked the United States to conduct aerial herbicide spraying in his country. In August of that year, the South Vietnamese Air Force conducted herbicide operations with American help. {After a significant policy debate} ... in November 1961, President Kennedy authorized Operation Ranch Hand, U.S. Air Force's herbicide program in Vietnam. (Same source as above; paraphrased). It is chilling to consider the various means that were researched and considered usable against one another by the powers in the Cold War. While I don't have an 'end date' that mind set saw considerable political push back in the 1970's. ("lessons learned" from Viet Nam, so to speak). 

Lee didn't have a large body of cavalry available for such an attack, because Stuart's Cavalry was trying to get into the Union rear and disrupt it at roughly the time that Pickett was charging up that hill. That was a better use of cavalry in the first place, given the dug in position of the forces on top of Cemetery Ridge, but from Lee's perspective it was an unfortunate failure. From the Union perspective, it was a successful engagement. It kept the cavalry from disrupting the forces engaged with Picket's division. 

University: from Latin universitas magistrorum et scholarium ("community of teachers and scholars)" The university (as we know it today) was not created ex nihilo but rather grew out of something else, which was the pursuit of learning in urban centers among those who could afford it. European higher education as far back as the 6th century was often found in Christian cathedral schools or monastic schools. Monks or nuns were the usual instructors. An example of one such school that later transformed into a university is the University of Paris. But the Church was not the only source of higher education. There had been a tradition for centuries of private tutors for the children of those with the means to afford them, and of course the opportunities for a select few to study with famous scholars from which "the Socratic method" has been passed down to us. The University of Bologna was founded in 1088 and is arguably the oldest university in Europe. It was established as a guild/group of students who were learning civil and canon law, and found it in their interest to form a society/guild for other reasons. 

there were Jews living all over the place in the ancient world, even before the diaspora after the two wars with the Romans in the first century (CE). 

Regrettably, the notebook full of material from the NATO staff officer's course (circa 1995) that included some basics on the problem of coups within the alliance seems to have suffered from an attic cleaning and is no longer in my possession. 

Short answer: they were visitors, merchants, diplomats, pilgrims, or a combination of all of the above. Thus people from all over were present but may not have lived in Jerusalem permanently. For example, a Parthian or a Mede would speak a tongue related to Persian (Middle Persian, thank you @T.E.D.); some of the others a Greek dialect (there were multiple dialects, so you'd expect those in Cappadocia or Pontus to speak regional dialects), Egyptian, etc. Those from Elam spoke a tongue not thought to be related to the commonly spoken languages mentioned: 

As deep drilling tech improves, the recoverable reserves may increase. Or not. - Who has the rights to drill where? - Who can preclude others from drilling where? - How big a slice of this revenue pie does anyone get? Territorial waters were once "three miles from the coast" but were later extended to "twelve miles from the coast." This started with the Russians in about 1960, and over time has become the internationally recognized standard. Since the 1970's, an ongoing effort has been underway regarding who has rights on continental shelves. This has led to the 200 nautical mile economic zones. Some of this relates to fishing rights and freedom of navigation, but as tech has improved this gets to mineral rights. (See the International Law of the Sea Treaty and its halting progress over the years in the ILOS link in the introduction). Where zones overlap, nations are expected to meet and agree on the boundary between them. Colonial legacy? Irrelevant to the current and future issue in the SCS. What is at issue is commercial competition for resources among a variety of players, China and ASEAN foremost. How long (Philippines) or how recent (Viet Nam) a relationship with the Americans has run may seem to be of interest if your look through a very narrow field of view at the US. The Americans are supporting actors, not stars in this film. Current concerns overwrite "historical" concerns, and in this case future concerns overwrite them with heavier ink. Fifty years ago, Malaysia was just emerging from the British sphere of influence. The US has a relationship with them now as a nation. Likewise with Indonesia, regardless of the Dutch influence from centuries past. None of that history informs why Malaysia and Indonesia have a relationship with the US now. They have present and future issues to address. The past isn't what matters. The future matters to all of the players in this game. The core American interest is in a local power balance and in commerce. ==================================================================== Note: having produced a small mountain of staff work, research and correspondence on this region in the early and mid 1990's, and a couple of brief papers at staff college (my forecasts were some right and some wrong on how our relationship with Viet Nam was going to evolve) I have found that things have changed slowly but inexorably toward a very predictable confrontation. What I guessed wrong, badly, was in how late it would be before American policy makers would accept the seriousness of China as a rival. Obama's "pivot toward Asia" is, from where I saw it then, about 12-15 years late). 

Whole books have been written on this, and I find Frehling's two volume "Road to Disunion" books to be some of the best and most accessible evaluations of the American political landscape (as it evolved into secession) from 1776 to 1861. From the founding documents to secession, he covers a lot of ground to include the Dred Scott decision's ripple effect. A shorter answer is as follows: With this Supreme Court decision, abolitionists were provided grist for their public campaign against slavery because the institution of slavery, which some people in non-slave states put up with (so long as it was not legal in their state), was now viewed as being importable beyond its boundaries in the slave states. That meant that the Missouri Compromise might not stand up under the pressures from the Slave States.

Partly Responsible? No more "responsible" than dozens of other social, cultural, economic and political factors While Forsythe's assertion as written is piece of artistic license, there was an association of pre-Christian symbolism, as reflected in such cultural icons as Richard Wagner's operas featuring pre-Christian German legends such as Der_Ring_des_Nibelungen. Cultural nationalism had been a factor in the previous century's establishment of the German Reich (Bismarck and the Kaisers). Hitler wasn't doing anything new, he was building on what Bismarck had managed about a half of a century before Hitler tried his hand at establishing a long lasting Reich. Cultural nationalism was one of his many themes used for political purposes. 

There is good reason to believe that such a strategy was considered ... at least until the 1970s. The strategic use of defoliants arose before the Cold War. From the Agent Orange Wikipedia entry, that mind set seems to have sustained for a few decades before a treaty was signed in the mid 1970's. 

So were herbicides still on the table up until the wall came down? Nothing to confirm or deny so far, but likely those plans got shelved during the period of summits and armaments reduction talks of the 1980's. (Will try to find a confirmation and edit if I do). 

There is no record of children under the age of 12 being sent to the galleys as slave/oarsmen. That grim fate, thankfully, the urchins of Rome were spared. 

About the Cuban Missile Crisis As to your confusion regarding the Cuban Missile Crisis: Kruschev wanted the Americans to feel the same discomfort the Russians/Soviets felt with nuclear weapons being based in unfriendly countries near to their borders. It was a political gambit that was consistent with the threatening and posturing both sides engaged in after World War II ended, and before the strategic Arms Limitations Treaty/Talks (SALT) in the early 1970's. That crisis led to establishing a hot line between Washington DC and Moscow, removal of some American missiles from Turkey, and political momentum building to reduce the risk of an actual nuclear war breaking out. (The SALT was a direct child of that political momentum).
