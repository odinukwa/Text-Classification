My rational guess is, the aliens would not brush their teeth. There are several alternatives to "brushing teeth", including wiping them, scraping, hard rinsing (sometimes with a disinfectant or antibiotic), flossing and picking (e.g. using a toothpick). Also for rinsing, frequent alcohol consumption can improve dental health; and that used to be extremely common amongst everybody (children included) when weak ale was consumed instead of water (water, contaminated by waste and refuse, made people sick: Weak ale, with about 1/4 the alcohol of modern beer, sterilized most of the bacteria, making it safer to drink: And better for the teeth. Many of the things we do, we do out of cultural inheritance; brushing is likely one of those: We didn't brush for 99% of the last 50,000 years (when we suspect modern rational brains first appeared). (See here for the invention of the toothbrush in China, 1498). We only began our current extreme hygiene and anti-smell rigor relatively recently; just a few centuries ago the idea that somebody had bad breath or bad body odor was seldom noticed: Everybody stank all the time! People bathed infrequently, and often not at all; they often wore perfumes and excess clothing to cover up their stink. It is entirely possible for aliens the idea of sticking a tool in their mouth, like a toothbrush, spoon or fork, repellent: We have seen similar reactions in human culture. Although the Chinese did invent the first toothbrush; notice that the Chinese eating implements do not get as deep in the mouth as spoons and forks: chopsticks barely make it past the teeth, they are intended to just bring food to the mouth, not shove it in. The Chinese version of a spoon does not enter the mouth, either: it is more of a small bowl with a handle; it also only brings the food to the mouth, but the tool does not enter the mouth. It is plausible an alien race, even looking like us, could be repelled by the idea of putting anything but food into their mouths. Toothbrushes only offer a slight mechanical advantage in cleaning the teeth and are not very thorough at all; it is why we are still encouraged to floss, and on top of that, need periodic cleaning to remove plaques. My point here is that brushing is obviously not the pinnacle in tooth cleaning, it is not the ideal approach, or the most efficient, or the most thorough. I imagine there are dozens of other ways to partially clean teeth, to the same extent or better, to prevent cavities or disease. A disinfectant/antibiotic rinse (like with alcohol, spit out), combined with tooth picks and/or flossing for the stuck bits, seems the most obvious for teeth like we have. With dozens of alternative methods that can be just as successful, it seems unlikely we humans and the aliens would both arrive at the same flawed idea. 

Disbelief mostly, otherwise no significant change. A majority of people believe what they want and what makes them comfortable, and people don't like uncomfortable truths. Additionally, the majority of people simply wouldn't understand, making them incapable of believing. There's no single best way to release the information. It depends on the motivation of the people releasing the information. What does the public have to gain by knowing they're in a simulation? How can you "dumb down" this evidence so that anyone can understand it? How can the average person convince themselves it's true? The reaction of the governments is to find a way to control the information. Maintaining control and peace. Likely attempting to exploiting whatever flaw in the system that proves it's a simulation, using those flaws to manipulate events, gather information that would be otherwise unobtainable, etc. If people were willing to accept it, I think the majority would continue on with life as it is. Afterall, a majority of people in the world already believe everything they do, say, or feel is being observed by a big man in the sky. They already believe that this life is just a temporary existence followed by an eternity of one kind or another. New religions would begin worshiping "the creators" or "simulators", whatever it may be. As for the way out, like I said, most people already believe there's a "way out" of this life, and everyone is going to get there eventually anyway. 

Organic Space Elevator The space faring creature is a large tree. It grows so tall, it extends past the atmosphere. Eventually reaching beyond geostationary orbit. It could shift its mass and pull up its roots to leave the planet below. Once in space, it could steer itself with leaves that act like solar sails. 

$URL$ Thus the habitable moon's day should equal its monthly orbit around it's planet, while its year should its primary planet's orbit around their sun. 

In ancient times there were probably tens or hundreds of thousands of separate tribes and other groups on Earth. The Roman Empire conquered hundreds or possibly thousands of realms, some of them large nations but most tiny city states or tribes. And there were hundreds of other tribes in northern and eastern Europe beyond the Roman Empire that gradually consolidated into modern European nations over centuries. In medieval Ireland there where about 90 or 150 kingdoms, each having a small area and a small population, for example. 

To state the obvious, an astronomical body has to produce or acquire an atmosphere in order to have one. Thus the composition of a atmosphere is likely to be the product of the average atmospheric acquisition rate per time unit multiplied by the number of time units between starting to acquire an atmosphere and stopping acquiring an atmosphere. Minus the average atmospheric loss rate per time unit multiplied by the number of time units between starting to lose an atmosphere and stopping losing an atmosphere. At any one time an astronomical body may be both gaining and losing atmosphere, gaining but not losing atmosphere, losing atmosphere and not gaining any, or neither gaining nor losing any atmosphere. And of course the rates of atmospheric gain and loss can vary enormously. One way for a planet to lose atmosphere is to have fast moving molecules, atoms, & ions escape into interplanetary space. Molecules, atoms, and ions escape from the outer layers of an atmosphere. I once read that it was calculated that if the escape velocity of the astronomical body was X times the average speed of the particles in the escape layer the astronomical body would retain atmosphere for billions of years without much escape. I don't remember exactly the value of X, but I think it was either 5 or 6. I believe the velocity of particles in the escape layer of an atmosphere depends on their temperature, which is the result of direct solar radiation upon them plus any heat rising up from the astronomical body. Thus some astronomical bodies far from the Sun, like Titan and Triton, are able to retain more atmosphere than they would be able to if at Earth's distance from the Sun. Astronomical bodies also lose atmospheric particles into space due to charged particles in the solar or stellar wind emitted by the star striking the atmosphere. Astronomical bodies with strong enough magnetic fields are protected from that process by deflecting or trapping the charged particles. Atmospheres can also be lost by turning liquid or solid. On Earth, for example, carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that keeps Earth warm enough for life, is trapped into minerals and lost from the atmosphere. Over ages of time plate tectonics gradually pushes some plates of the crust beneath other plates and down into the magma layer. Eventually some of that carbon dioxide enriched magma reaches the surface and carbon dioxide is released back into the atmosphere, maintaining a rough equilibrium. Planets without plate tectonics will not have that carbon dioxide cycle. On Earth, most plants and animals release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, while plants also convert carbon dioxide and sunlight into biochemicals and oxygen, thus producing Earth's free oxygen in the atmosphere. Thus it is relatively simple to calculate whether a specific astronomical body would retain a specified atmosphere for billions of years, and much lss easy to calculate whether it would ever acquire that specific type of atmosphere given the initial conditions of planetary formation. 

Expansion to new lands would be limited. Wars over resources would be common and abortion would happen regularly. It's likely that small communities, lone rangers, family pioneers, etc. would be non-existent. Essentially, individuals can't be separated from a breeding population. As soon as a woman became pregnant, she would lose her usefulness to men wanting to have sex to stay alive. Since as you say "Effects of males mating with pregnant females is the same as contraception-mating." 

It's just not realistic for a human like species to not investigate something like this. Curiosity is, in many ways, a required trait or byproduct of intelligence. It's needed to explore, learn and push the bounds of knowledge. People study and examine everything they can lay their hands on. Another species that shows intelligence (even disregarding what we perceive as supernatural abilities) is just too tempting of a subject for people to leave alone. Of course this would be a divided issue. There would be pro-creatures-rights groups and pro-human groups (advocating for the advancement of the human species through further understanding of these creatures). In today's society I can imagine the popular opinion being for creature-rights, while the behind the scenes story is secret installations filled with creature test subjects. Even the laws and tabooness suggested in other answers would be violated, perhaps not publicly, but it would happen. In the end, humans are just not advanced/peaceful/mature enough as a society to respect the rights of another species. 

During the pregnancy spell, the mother can manipulate the genes of their offspring by channeling the energy of the aether through people (or maybe even animals?). This channeling will slowly alter the DNA of the offspring with the genes of the subject being channeled through. This channeling can only be done in close proximity and with deliberate effort. This allows the mother to create amalgams of genes from people she identifies as having valuable genes. This of course can go wrong by combining genes in bad ways. And it can also go well by careful selection to get just the right set of genes. It also allows the possibility of making genetic clones. Channeling through a single individual for the duration of the spell would cause all the genes to be the same as the target individual. 

$URL$ Obviously more advanced steam engines could have been used in later dirigibles if more efficient internal combustion engines had not become available. Would steam turbines have had a better power/eight ratio? Would using oil or kerosene as fuel for a steam engine have been more efficient? How far could steam engines for airships be developed? Could they have competed with airplanes as well as airships with internal combustion engines did? How could they avoid being replaced by airplanes? If anyone has good answers to those questions you might be able to have reasonably plausible sort of steam powerered airships. 

People don't need an imitation of the sky to have a day night cycle. Due to my aversion to ultraviolet alight I keep the blinds closed all the time in my room, for example. In many parts of the colony people or automatic timers will simply turn the lights in rooms and corridors/streets on or off, up or down, to fit the time of the artificial day cycle. Perhaps there will be light wells or courtyards with large lights working all the time and people will open shades or shutters in the "morning" and close them in the "evening" to change the light levels. But public areas (and private areas in the homes of the rich, if any) could add to their attractiveness with domes showing day and night sky images. Any type of park or recreation of outdoors on Earth would benefit from a more or less realistic sky. 

Plants can only use the frequencies of light that pass through the natural filter of Earth's atmosphere. Humans can see many of the comparatively few frequencies that Earth's atmosphere is transparent to. The Earth's atmosphere adsorbs Gamma Rays, X Rays, most ultraviolet rays, and many frequencies of radio waves. Earth's atmosphere is largely transparent to visible light that human eyes can see, a few neighboring ultraviolet frequencies, and many infrared frequencies, and in another part of the spectrum it is largely transparent to many frequencies of radio waves.
