The challenge is to explain what is meant by a "inalienable natural right". Suppose we try to define inalienable natural rights for example in terms a God's revelation, or in terms of The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly. Then the fact that it will nevertheless make perfect sense to describe a something inalienable natural right but against or outside a God's will or the Declaration, will immediately show that the definition of inalienable natural right in terms of a God's revelation or The Universal Declaration of Human Rights has failed. Several major, predominantly Muslim countries criticized the Universal Declaration of Human Rights provisions for democratic principles, protection for religious freedom, freedom of association and freedom of the press, as well as equality in rights and equal protection under the law. Rights and freedoms stipulated in this Declaration are to be subject to the Islamic sharia. On Asian values of Asian states perspective, the Bangkok Declaration of 1993 offers an extended critique of human rights universalism. They view the principles of sovereignty and noninterference, calling for greater emphasis on economic, social, and cultural rights, particularly the right to economic development, as inalienable natural rights too, over civil and political rights. War Resisters International has stated that the right to conscientious objection to military service, and the right to refuse to kill, are inalienable natural rights too. God’s counsel to parents: whenever children get out of line, we should beat them with a rod (Proverbs 13:24, 20:30, and 23:13-14). If they are shameless enough to talk back to us, we should kill them (Leviticus 20:9, Deuteronomy 21:18-21, Mark 7:9-13, and Matthew 15:4-7). The Bible even tells us we are free to sell our daughters into slavery (Exodus 21:26-27). If a man discovers on his wedding night that his bride is not a virgin, he must stone her to death on her father’s doorstep (Deuteronomy 22:13-21). Over time we read the Bible selectively and often metaphorically. But that is just the point: we must be consulting our standards of morality that do not come from God in order to judge which aspects of God's word to take literally and which aspects to ignore. Before we worship a God or Jesus we must judge him good, so our inalienable natural rights are not derived and are independent from a God or Jesus. A derivation from descriptive statements with “is” to prescriptive statements with “ought” is impossible. Without an objective, "inalienable natural goal", a "inalienable natural right" is difficult to establish. Without an objective "self-evident" truth is possible to think the opposite without a contradiction. Persuading someone would necessarily mean appealing to values he already possesses.

But how is refuting this thesis an attack on descriptivism? Descriptivism doesn't require that thesis, does it? Furthermore, when does Kripke show that a statement being analytic means that it must be a priori? From what I've read of Naming and Necessity and Identity and Necessity, he seems to feel that you need some sort of argument or proof to show that the labels analytic, a priori, and/or necessary are interchangeable. Am I misunderstanding here, or getting his arguments mixed up? 

Without science far less lives would have been possible. Of course all these will die again, but that cannot be blamed on science. Consider the development of mankind. Two thousand years ago there were about 200 million people. Now we are more than 7 billions. That would not have been possible without modern science in agriculture and medicine. It can be observed that always when the agricultural and medical technologies were improved, the population has grown (see the second diagram). Source de.Wikipedia. 

Cantor devised set theory for application to reality but started from the divine wisdom of the hierarchy of infinities. My question is: What of Cantor's claims has become reality? What are practical applications of set theory? And what parts of transfinite set theory require the philosophical position of platonism? Here are some quotes which may help to familiarize with the stuff. In a letter to Hilbert he wrote about his plan of a paper on set theory and its applications: "The third part contains the applications of set theory to the natural sciences: physics, chemistry, mineralogy, botany, zoology, anthropology, biology, physiology, medicine etc. It is what Englishmen call 'natural philosophy'. In addition we have the so called 'humanities', which, in my opinion, have to be called natural sciences too, because also the 'mind' belongs to nature." [G. Cantor, letter to D. Hilbert (20 Sept 1912)] Cantor explained his impetus for devising set theory to Mittag-Leffler: "Further I am busy with scrutinizing the applications of set theory to the physiology of organisms. [...] I have been occupied for 14 years with these ideas of a closer exploration of the basic nature of all organic; they are the true reason why I have undertaken the painstaking and hardly rewarding business of investigating point sets, and all the time never lost sight of it, not for a moment. Further I am interested, purely theoretically, in the nature of the states and what belongs to them, because I have my opinions on that topic which later may become formulated mathematically; the striking impression that you perhaps may obtain will disappear, when you consider that also the state in some sense represents an organic being." [G. Cantor, letter to G. Mittag-Leffler (22 Sept 1884)] "By applied set theory I understand what usually is called physical science or cosmology. To this realm all so-called natural sciences are belonging, those concerning the anorganic as well as the organic world. [...] For mathematical physics the theory of types is particularly important because the latter theory is a powerful and sharp tool for the discovery and the intellectual construction of the so-called matter. Related to this is the applicability of the theory of types in chemistry. [...] Of very special interest seems to me the application of mathematical type theory on study and research in the realm of the organic." [G. Cantor, letter to G. Mittag-Leffler (18 Nov 1884)] "This has created my desire to replace the mechanical explanation of nature by a more complete one, which I would call in opposition to the former an 'organic' one." [G. Cantor, letter to W. Wundt (4 March 1883)] "The actual infinite in abstracto and in concreto, however, where I call it transfinitum, are not only subject of an extended number theory but also, as I hope to show, of an advanced natural science and physics." [G. Cantor, letter to I. Carbonnelle (28 Nov 1885)] Cantor says that he has no safer knowledge of anything in nature than of his transfinite set theory. "Therefore I am convinced that this theory one day will belong to the common property of objective science". [G. Cantor, letter to I. Jeiler (20 May 1888, Whitsun)] Finally Cantor devised transfinite set theory in order to defend Christian religion. "The time is not far, however, that my teaching will turn out to be a really exterminating weapon against all pantheism, positivism and materialism." [G. Cantor, letter to J. Hontheim (21 Dec 1893)] "The general set theory [...] definitely belongs to metaphysics. [...] and the fact that my presently written work is issued in mathematical journals does not modify the metaphysical contents and character of this work. [...] By me Christian philosophy is for the first time confronted with the true teachings of the infinite in its beginnings. [G. Cantor, letter to T. Esser (1/15 Feb 1896)] Concluding: "If one has recognized the truth of something, then one knows to be in possession of the truth and one feels [...] sort of duty, as far and as long as power reaches, to tell it to others." [G. Cantor, draft of a letter to A. Schmid (18 April 1887)] 

The epistemic argument against descriptivism, as laid out by the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy states: 

The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy and the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy are great, free resources that you may find helpful. They're clear and concise, and you can look at the sources listed for further reading if you've found something that interests you. 

But, having read the relevant pages in Naming and Necessity, I'm lost (just to be clear, I have read most of the book up to page 88 so far). On page 78, we have: 

Perhaps it is helpful to emphasize the aspect of set theory. The set of dogs is a subset of the set of mammals. If there is an element of some basic universal set (that has its well-known problems which do not interfere with the present topic however) that has the property dog, then this element has the property mammal too. That means "if dog then mammal" or in short D → M. In the form "every dog is a mammal" and "if a dog, then a mammal" the statements are nearly identical. Here and also in form used in the original question they express exactly the same information. 

I have bolded what would be the first level predicates. Combined with "in the X," we have formed 9 second level predicates. Some of these are compatible with each other, like 1, 2, and 3 (what happened yesterday was past this morning [in the past], is past right now [in the present], and will be past tomorrow [in the future]). 3, 5, and 7 were used to respond to the first paradox, and they're compatible as well. However, some are incompatible, such as 2, 5, and 8 (successively, M is "past in the present", "present in the present," and "future in the present"). In order to solve this paradox, we must again say that events don't have these three properties at the same time (take an event E happening now, it had one property [8] in the past, has the second property [5] in the present, and will have the third property [2] in the future). Thus we introduce third level predicates. But these will again face the same problem. And hence we have an infinite regress. McTaggart elaborates on his A-paradox in the second volume of The Nature of Existence (1927). 

Presocratics do not usually use the word episteme, they prefer gnosis. In Plato, episteme is regularly about the forms. The hypotheses that episteme is the same as perception, true opinion, or true opinion with an account, are all refuted. Plato uses gnosis relatively rarely, although he does use it of knowledge of the beautiful. For Heraclitus, “People are deceived about the gnosis of the obvious things”. For Aristotle, episteme is about the causes, represented in syllogistic deductions. Aristotle says that episteme may be distinguished into practical, productive, and theoretical, and that theoretical episteme into mathematical, physical, and theological. In Aristotle, episteme is often translated as science. The Aristotelian term gnosis is used about particular facts, observable and unobservable. Episteme by contrast, sometimes refers to scientific knowledge or to a body of truths known. Mathematics or astronomy counts as episteme. Sometimes refers to crafts and disciplines that lack a demonstrative structure, but are also cases of episteme, a body of truths. Aristotle explicit comments are mostly about episteme, if we think of episteme as continuous with the philosophy of science. Aristotle says that all animals share some kind of gnosis because they all have the faculty of perception. In general, in old Greece Gnosis means more knowledge by perception, particular facts, episteme means more knowledge by systematic study or demonstration. In the New Testament, gnosis appears with the sense of spiritual knowledge. In later Greek writers, it is used especially of esoteric knowledge. 

I found the following explanation in Barry Dainton's Time and Space (specifically in section 3.2). As has been already mentioned, the statement "M is present, will be past and has been future" translates into "M is present in the present, past in the future and future in the past." Here we have three second level predicates, but there are in fact nine second level predicates in total. They are: 

I don't understand where the infinite regress comes from. He says that we are constructing a second A-series, but how so? I don't understand what there is to say after saying "M is present, has been future, and will be past." Thanks in advance. 

Short Explanation: It looks like instrumentalism. Instrumentalism avoids the debate between anti-realism and philosophical or scientific realism. It may be better characterized as non-realism. Instrumentalism shifts the basis of evaluation away from whether or not phenomena observed actually exist, and towards an analysis of whether the results and evaluation fit with observed phenomena. By abuse of language, a bare instrumentalist description could be referred to as an interpretation, although this usage is somewhat misleading since instrumentalism explicitly avoids any explanatory role; that is, it does not attempt to answer the question why. 

This is not a logical fallacy. In logic "If A, then B" is equivalent to the so called contraposition "If not B, then not A". Both statements are true (or false) under same conditions. You can only doubt that "If good lecturere, then slides are made available in advance" is a true statement. But that has nothing to do with logic. 

What were these notions of completeness that had to be abandoned in order to fit ZFC within the framework of first-order logic? Second-order logic (SOL) quantifies over predicates or relations including functions. SOL cannot be reduced to FOL, according to current set theory, because FOL addresses at most a countably infinite set. By the theorem of Skolem there is a countable model that satisfies precisely the same first-order sentences about real numbers and sets of real numbers as the real set R of real numbers. In the countable model there cannot be all uncountably many subsets of N or R and the least upper bound property cannot be satisfied for every bounded subset of R. So, if the real numbers are uncountable, then there must be many FOL models of R. In SOL, however, there is merely one model (up to isomorphism). SOL has a main disadvantage however. According to a result of Gödel's SOL does not admit a complete proof theory. So SOL is not logic, properly speaking. Quine calls it "set theory in sheep's clothing". 

Unlikely to be a philosophical school. This question is for an empirical science as psychology to solve not to philosophy. But it has implications for the "philosophy of happiness", as we shall see. Regarding happiness, what philosophers can observe before the empirical science is what is dictated by the common sense that happiness isn't pleasure. Pursuit of happiness is not to seek pleasure. Pleasure is satiable but not happiness. If, for whatever reason, one does equate happiness with pleasure, then the paradox of hedonism arises. 

If we have to choose only one word to represent the view of analytic philosophers to continental philosophy I think is "unintelligible" or "obscure". One frequent criticism of analytic philosophy is that it is a highly technical mode of thought, restricting itself to criticism of minute details of language, and has abandoned the great narrative of a worldview. A perennial criticism of analytic philosophy is that it fails to engage with our deepest and most basic human concerns, and has thereby rendered itself irrelevant to the larger culture.
