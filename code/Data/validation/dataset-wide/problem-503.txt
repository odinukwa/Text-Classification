Here's my solution. Take off wheels, pedals, and handlebars, and place the bike under the bed. Ok, that may not be the right solution, but it might point you in the right direction. If you start taking parts off your bike, you can fit it in a pretty small place. You might even want to consider taking parts off and storing everything but the frame inside your apartment. Take out the bottom bracket and leave that in the house. Wheels can be easily stored inside. The seat/seat post is dead easy to remove and can be stored just about anywhere. Basically you should store as much inside as you can. 

The installation instructions linked to from the page you linked to shows the "fixing bolt" labeled as "3" in the following diagram 

Personally, I think it depends a little on the design of the quick release lever. I put my front one pointing upwards aligned with the fork. However, some quick release designs will actually contact the fork before they are fully closed. In this case I would place it slightly behind the fork. For the back quick release, I position it between the seat and chain stays. Again if you have something in the way, you'll have to adjust parallel with the seatstay or even behind it a bit if something is in the way. I've seen some people position them both facing backwards. The idea is that they are less likely to catch on something and open as you are riding. However, I think this makes them more likely to be opened by some other factor when not riding because there is nothing guarding them. This would be fine if you checked them before each ride, as we probably should, but most people probably aren't consistently checking their quick releases every time they ride. If they are in a position that they are least likely to be opened accidentally in most situations, then that is probably the safest. 

To me it would depend on the speed of traffic. If the traffic is moving slow enough such that you can ride at about the same speed, then it should be possible to take option 2, and make your way over to the left lane. Try to move over to the left lane ahead of time, so you aren't cutting across the road too quickly, because this will slow your forward speed. If the traffic is moving much faster than you are, it's most likely safer to just take option 3 and cross as a pedestrian. This may include dismounting and actually walk your bike across the pedestrian walk. Technically it is probably illegal to use the pedestrian light to cross while riding, although I do this all the time, and I've never heard of anybody in my area getting a fine for doing this. Option 1 is probably something that you should never do. It's dangerous and illegal to make a left hand from a bike lane when you have to cross over a lane that goes straight though. 

I have an old road bike with a quill stem and I want to raise the stem. After raising it to where I want it, the stem has about an inch between the high end of the expander nut and the top of the headset. I looked for markings on the stem and didn't see any indicating how much should be inserted. Is there a minimum amount that should be inserted into the headtube to ensure my safety? 

I don't have any experience with that particular unit, but I do have a Garmin Oregon 450, which is a "hiking" GPS, but I find it works great for cycling. I've found there's 2 important things to getting a lock on satellites. First, as you mention, is a clear view of the sky. The second important thing is don't move. The faster you are moving the more difficult it is for the unit to lock onto a satellite. The best advice is to turn it on before you ride and wait until it has a lock before you start riding. I've found that I don't really need a view of the sky, as I can turn it on in my house or in my garage, and get a signal no problem. I can't however, turn it on in my office, where there's quite a bit of concrete around me. I also find it helps if you turn it on in the last place you turned it off. I think the GPS assumes that it's in the same spot it was last time, and tries to lock onto the same satellites. I find if I travel with the unit turned off, it takes longer to get a signal when I do turn it on. I don't know if this is how it actually works, but this is how it seems to work for me. Signal is also affected by where you are on the earth. It works better when you're closer to the equator. You're in Melbourne, which isn't close to the equator (-38 degrees latitude, but a little closer than I am up in Canada (45 degrees latitude). I don't think you're far enough that it should be a serious problem. 

Update I was able to remove the non-drive side by using my vise grips to grip the tool closer to the bottom bracket. The drive side still won't move, but the vise grips are slipping, not the bottom bracket tool, so I think I may just replace the tools if they have something better at my local bike store. 

Assuming you already have a bike, have you looked into a trainer? Since you're not buying as much equipment, essentially just the resistance unit, you can get much better quality without spending as much. I got a CycleOps Fluid2 and it's pretty quiet, and also folds down pretty small which would probably be beneficial in an apartment. There's quite a wide range of them, and I understand that most of them are pretty quiet as long as you stay away from the cheaper "wind" trainers. 

The drive side on most bottom brackets is reverse threaded. That means you have to turn it clockwise to loosen it. If you don't care about destroying it, and are just going to replace it anyway, you can try this trick that I found, which seems like it would allow you to get a lot more leverage. 

What are the other cyclists in your group eating? I go out for similarly long rides, and most people don't eat anything on the ride. I would say to make sure you are well fed (but not overly full) before the ride starts, and you probably won't feel the need to eat something for the ride. 50 KM at an average speed of 35 km/h will mean that the ride is over in an hour and a half. Bring a bottle with Gatorade or similar to keep your electrolytes up, and possibly another bottle of just water for those times when you feel like just having water. Also, if you are going to eat something, eat small amounts on a regular basis, and don't wait until you feel like you need more energy. By that time it's already too late. The same goes for water. Drink before you start to feel thirsty. Get to know your own body and how much water/food you're going to need for a particular length and difficulty of ride so that your body doesn't end up with a deficit during the ride. 

Take the one with 11-28 for instance. It will have 11 teeth on the smallest ring of the cassette, and 28 teeth on the largest ring of the cassette. The 11 speed cassettes will have 11 diffferent cogs on the the cassette. Look at the cassette you have already. Count how many teeth are on the smallest and largest cogs of the cassette. The most popular is probably 11-28 for 11 speed cassettes. Make sure you count the number of cogs as well to ensure you are getting the correct cassette. Also, I think there are some compatibility problems between 11 speed some manufacturers. If your bike currently has Shimano parts, you should probably stick with Shimano parts. 

The size of a bike has very little to do with the wheel size. For example, if you look at the Surly Instigator with 26 inch wheels, the smallest size has an effective top tube of 55.5 cm, and a reach of 37.8 cm. Compare that to the Trek X-Calibre which on the smallest model uses 27.5 inch wheels but has an effective top tube of 52.5 mm and a reach of 35.2 cm. For road cycling just about all riders use 700c wheels and they pretty much accommodate all riders. Putting smaller wheels on a bike isn't going to change the reach which is a very important part of how a bike fits. The standover height will be lower, but mountain bikes generally don't have a huge problem with standover height, and the seat can usually be dropped pretty low. And if you put smaller wheels on the bike, the bottom bracket and pedal clearance will be lower than designed. What is your height? Which brands have you looked at? Big brands such as Trek or Specialized have a large range of sizes. Some models use 29 inch wheels for the larger sizes, and 27.5 inch for the smaller sizes. 

It's hard to tell from the picture, but it looks like a cottered crank. I don't think anybody makes them anymore, but not all hope is lost. You can likely replace the entire crankset and bottom bracket assuming the bike has a bottom bracket which is still available, which is somewhat likely. It may cost more than you are willing to spend on the old bike though. 

Like all bikes, single speed and fixie bikes come in all differing qualities, from cheap, to reasonable to expensive. I think the only advantage if building one yourself is that you could save a lot of money on the frame and spend more on things like rims, hubs, and other components that will give you much more bang for your buck. That's not to estimate the importance of a good frame, but it's often possible to find an old steel frame in good condition, put some good wheels on there, and get a really good ride without spending a whole lot of money. If the frame and forks are already assembled, and you buy a pre-built wheelset, assembling a fixed gear or single speed bicycle can be done quite easily.
