There is no "famous, red, blue, wet, dry, lethargic, celestial", as in Esperanto they're "fama, ruĝa, blua, malseka, seka, letargia, ĉiela". All are adjectives in both languages. "angrily, wetly, very, lethargically, on Mondays" are "kolere, malseke, tre, letargie, lunde". All are adverbs. "sincerity, hound (dog), dilapidation, epoch, eczema, shoulder-blade" are "sincereco, hundo, ruinigo, epoko, ekzemo, skapolo". All are nouns. "pony, puppy, kitten, duckling" are "ĉevalido, hundido, katido, anasido" (ido means "an offspring", so it's like "baby horse"). 

Ease of learning, reading, and pronunciation. Therefore there can't be consonant clusters (imagine Russian), or sounds not in most languages (ex. English's þ, ð, and w, the distinction in its two l sounds, or its many vowels), and the alphabet/syllabary should look distinct even if the person hasn't learnt it yet (ex. katakana, runes, hobo symbols, or most of the roman letters - not Arabic, Braille or kanji). This is not just so that the language doesn't feel impossible, but also to help hard-of-seeing people and dyslexic people who recognize letters slightly more based on "shape" (it's hard to explain, but telling the difference between o and 0, or n and h in bad handwriting, can be very hard for example). 

Unfortunately, my sources for this are in Swedish and/or from old periodicals from the actual time when Esperanto was new, so I can't link anything. If you can read Swedish, find the book called "100 years of Esperanto", and in Esperanto there's another book you can try, "La Esperanto-Movado en Upsalo" (as I remember the title). Basically what happened is, the book first came out in Russian, and from there people just found it as something amusing or interesting to do in their free time. That's how it spread very minorly to other countries, through bilingual people who translated it. Once it got to Germany, some people who had visited Germany and who were students at the University of Uppsala noticed it and decided to not only form a club (there was also a German club at this time, but it was the only club in the world I think) but also, when they heard that Esperanto was starting to be banned in Russia/a Russian Esperanto periodical was closed down, they started their own which grew to be very big and influental in the first few beginning years. (Swedes are easily outraged about injusticies so honestly that's probably why they started it, also Uppsala is very well-known for being a "linguistic research capital".) They managed to get funding from people outside of Sweden, among other things, and used it to distribute flyers (they also got flyers from Zamenhof himself and wrote to him a lot, asking about stuff). Their periodical was simply called "Lingva Internacia" or something like that, but it included all sorts of stuff, like both local Swedish news and Esperanto news. The club and so on was written about in the Swedish newspapers too, among other things, so that's how it got some more publicity. Basically for about five years, Uppsala was the "capital of the Esperanto world" due to this, and they influenced other groups to start making their own periodicals. I believe the very initial list of potential subscribers was obtained by mailing Zamenhof himself and asking about it. When other countries started having more periodicals and clubs too, they also started being advertised in the countries' local newspapers - this was sometimes in a normal news-y way, but other times the members actually paid for advertising in the hopes that it would make new members; this was a very expensive thing to do at the time. This doesn't mean that the clubs or periodicals were any big (it only takes two people to form a club!). Don't forget that this is also a time when you did normal advertising in the newspaper, so anyone looking for an Esperanto penpal or teacher would likely use the newspaper to place the ad. It was also possible to subscribe to periodicals even if you lived abroad, so ex. there were French readers of the English Esperanto periodical. Of course, this was also a different time from today, where it was extremely normal to try out new things and different clubs and so on. It seems like most of the people simply heard about the language from friends or from various newspaper articles about it. A lot of people simply told even strangers they met about it (ex. on the train). Even back in the 1920's and earlier though, there were elementary schools (among other things) who were teaching the language to children in preparation of either "the general future" or for them learning another language later. The craze about this was honestly slowly growing to be very big, even train personnel and the police in a few different countries were being instructed in Esperanto for training for dealing with foreigners. Though of course, the world wars and then the monolingual English speakers growing to power really squashed a lot of it. And of course, most people used it as a hobby instead of thinking about it as a serious world language, but they did at least consider it fun so that's how it was propelled. I also remember reading that news about Esperanto was randomly broadcast on the radio in its early days; that's how I heard it reached the Faroe Islands for example. Also, a lot of the people who initially learnt the langauge were very educated to begin with (ex. rich French people, rich Swedish University students), so they had some influence on other people already. Those days were also different from today in that people needed a world language, but there really was none - English certainly wasn't big (German and French were much bigger!), but it was an age of new technology, new ideas about psychology, and easier/cheaper travel between countries and so on. But honestly I think the main point was that people were bored and thought learning a new language was simply fun when they heard about it, and it was an easy way to make foreign friends and get foreign news (this is a point I've read about quite a few times when I read texts from the same era - the local news was usually not at all accurate regarding foreign countries, and people loved collecting stuff like stamps and postcards). Edit: Something I forgot! I've read that people used to take a text (ex. a book) in Esperanto, and then translate it in their head, reading aloud, in real-time in front of their friends in order to convince them of how easy it was to understand and how fast it was to learn. This is mentioned in that one book that's a collection of Zamenhof's answers about grammar and vocabulary questions. Teachers were mainly pressing the fact that it was a good test of how good students were at language ("if they fail at Esperanto, we know they're no good at language and it's useless to teach them ex. French in secondary school"), and that it really gave the kids enthusiasm about history and geography, since the teachers were having the main part of learning Esperanto center around having the students send letters to lots of different countries in it. This is mentioned in quite a few places and pretty much corresponds with what modern educational tests with Esperanto are saying today, but I remember one source for this is here: $URL$ 

What do you see on this image? Of course, a button. But what exactly is depicted here? Someone young enough may have never seen a diskette, but still, they know the context this image conveys. 

The official system of Romanization of the Thai languiage is Royal Thai General System of Transcription (RTGS). All road signs, landmarks, and so on are to be transcribed according to RTGS. RTGS has certain pro's, likewise it uses a plain Latin alphabet, no tone marks, no vowel length marks, etc. And these are also con's (e.g. you can't read it properly when you need). There are plenty of unofficial systems. For example, one of the prominent resources for Thai language learners, Thai-Language.com, has several systems of Romanization: 

to count as in "I counted my cats; fifteen are they"; to consider, to think as in "I think that I'm too fat". 

I would recommend reading the above questions along with their answers prior to moving forward here. Maybe the most crucial point is that the following statements about Serbian, Bosnian, Croatian, and Montenegrin are all true: 

There's a nice table drawn in the Wikipedia's page for Finnish locative system. You may find it useful. 

De Vaan, 2008 (p.233) lists PIE and as synonyms. Also, Whitney, 1879 (#399) explained on vowel-to-consonant transition and suggested examples and . In Sanskrit, दार and द्वार are mostly synonyms. They both mean entrance, and they are often interchangeable in sacral texts. On the other hand, there's no evidence that द्वार can be related to वृत्र (to rotate). P.S. In Russian, there are many words derived from , including "вертеть" (to rotate, to turn) and "ворота" (gate). The least has an ancient form of "врата" . 

The more places for possible "mutation", the more likely a mutation will occur. Why changes can be massive This article has an interesting insight: 

be aware that a native speaker may use virtually any type of approximant, flap, or trill for both and or skip it completely; for yourself, try producing as close as possible to the "perfect" alveolar trill because your accent introduces many other imperfections that you don't yet notice. Don't add there yet another imperfection. 

It is because the phonetic tools (of English and speaker's native language) are too different. The secondary reason is that in the languages of Asian region (namely, those belonging to Sino-Tibetan, Tai–Kadai, and, to a certain extent, Austroasiatic families), the syllable arguably plays a bigger role (than in English). 

Just for sake of posting an answer (comments get deleted often). The term is called Mutual intelligibility: 

to be (an object is a part of set ), e.g. "this is an apple"; to be (an object has property of ), e.g. "the box is red" to be (located at), e.g. "I am at the office"; to mean, e.g. "to live is to love"; 

They are two different phenomenons. Portuguese. The first one is a regular adjective, inflected according to Grammatical Gender which governs adjective and verb inflections according to the associated noun. This is also confirmed by presence of plural forms: MASC/PL obrigados, FEM/PL obrigadas and diminutive forms MASC obrigadinho and FEM obrigadinha. Don't be confused with the fact that the actual noun or pronoun is omitted. Thai politeness particles are of a different nature. There is no noun/adjective/verb inflections in Thai whatsoever. Instead, the politeness particles, like ครับ , คะ only denote the social relationship between a speaker and a listener. For example, a Thai mother can address their kid with to indicate her power over a kid or to stress some request to be fulfilled, and at the same time a father may address his kid (usually, a young daughter) with to indicate his father's feelings. Also, in military is widely used, regardless of the gender. Furthermore, it can be even ครับผม , where ผม is a masculine 1st person pronoun ("I"). 

You can get online news and bloggers to write about it, you can ask indie companies about putting some words of it on their CD cases and organic soy milk, etc. Basically it has to somehow reach the mass public without them in any way actually looking for it. 

Grammar (how are words constructed and orderly connected? what classifications / parts of speech does English / Esperanto have?): It is extremely like Japanese, where there is a root word (that has no stem-change) which simply changes in ending or prefix according to which role in grammar it is playing, and where verbs can (and often do) compound onto each other. Also it's the same in where there are very very few exceptions. This basic concept is modernly very different in English, as for example, we have many mismatching pairs like "city, urban", "rain, pluvial", "fear, coward/poltroon, scary" and so on. In Esperanto every single pair stems from the same root, and there are a few more suffixes than in English, ex. one for "to cause" and one for "to become" (this was present in Old English and we have remnants of it today, ex. in bedazzled). For example: 

And so on and so forth. Changing the prefix or suffix is the way to get the corresponding related pair (unless you want to use a synonym, but this is the normal way). Kolere is angrily, kolero is anger. Ĉiela is celestial, ĉielo is sky. That sort of logic is the basis of the entire language. Patro is father, bopatro is father-in-law. Words are basically constructed in the same way as English - the starting word of a compound modifies the ending word of the compound (an oft-cited example is "songbird and birdsong"). Most of the prefixes and suffixes have some sort of equivalent in English too. The difference is that in Esperanto, practically any word can be compounded — this includes prepositions being compounded to each other, or prepositions being prefixed to verbs etc. (as is done in Swedish, among other languages). For example, "to pick out" can be said in exactly that word order, but "to outpick" can also be said. Prefixes and suffixes can also be compounded to each other, for an easy example pra-avo (grand-pa), pra-pra-avo (great-grand-pa). Numbers can also be compounded into words, ex. unu-op-ulo ("one-collective-being/person", meaning "individual"). As for word order in general, it has very little rules. The definite article and the word "no" have to come before the word they describe (but the adjective that describes the noun, can come either before or after the noun, for example). Words marking questions (like "does" in "Doesn't he want to eat?") have to be the very first word in the sentence or clause that introduces the question. The rest of the so-called word-order rules are basically just trends, people have decided that one trend or another gives a certain flavour and so on. The same is true for compounds, in that it's just usually a trend as to whether a word is written as a compound or written separately, both are allowed in the language. So in Esperanto it's perfectly acceptable to have sentences just as in English, with "I eat apples on Monday", but also perfectly acceptable is as in Swedish, "On Monday eat I apples", or even bigger variations like "I apples on monday eat". This is thanks to an accusative case existing, but even then, the rule is that "the accusative doesn't have to be used if the meaning is obvious". As for verb tenses and moods, everything that can be said in English is perfectly able to be said in Esperanto. The difference is that Esperanto speakers tend to not use all of the more precise forms. For example, Esperanto can easily say "I had been going", but instead people will simply say "I went". This mirrors Japanese, Swedish, etc. In a similar vein, Esperanto verbs do not conjugate according to number or gender, so it essentially looks like "I am, he am, they am". The parts of speech are just the same as in English if you ignore that it has the accusative case, and there are a few items that are simply more clarified than English. There are nouns, adjectives, adverbs, exclamations, prepositions, conjunctions and "particles" (I forget what they're called - words that aren't really any of these categories). There's present, future, and past tense, also the subjunctive and command form; other forms like "I want to go" are expressed with compounds or prepositions etc. The more clarified parts are that Esperanto has a distinct word for reflexive pronouns, like "I did it to myself", versus "I don't like it, myself". The only cases are nominative and accusative, but there is effectively a genitive because the same ending for adjectives is also the possessive ending (though we can also denote a posession using "of", as in English "the hair of the dog"). There is no indefinite artcle in Esperanto (which mirrors Icelandic, Japanese, etc) but if necessary we can say "one dog", for example. Vocabulary (from what languages does English / Esperanto borrow terms / derived words?): Originally, most words were from Latin and German. This branches into similarities with languages such as French, Yiddish, English, and Danish. Modernly, Esperanto borrows either the most international word, or the only word that can be borrowed (ex. "geisha" is of course only available from Japanese). In some cases, authors took words from languages they knew and so even if there were more international words, those words became the common ones (some vulgar words are like that). So, just as with where most of English's loanwords come from, most of Esperanto's new/loanwords nowadays come from Latin or Greek. Most technology words are therefore basically the same in both languages, such as "television" or "internet", where there's just one or two letters in difference between the languages. The Esperanto is "televidilo" (a compound of "tele- + see + tool"), as the Latin roots themselves are tele- and videre (to see); for internet it's "interreto". Medical and botanical/animal words however are pretty much always borrowed from Latin. There are a few trends like that how most time words (day, month, year, minute - tago, monato, jaro) were all originally borrowed from German. When Esperanto doesn't borrow words, it simply makes them up from existing roots. For example, bildliteraturo means comics, and bild is picture in German, Swedish, etc. Of course, literature comes from French and Latin (in Latin it's literatura, apparently). The same word in Swedish would be "drawn series", and in Japanese for example the compound includes "picture/painting" instead of "literature", so as you can see Esperanto creates the word from its most logical form instead of directly borrowing the way another language created it. Semantics (words in what languages share similar connotations and implications with English / Esperanto words?) There are a great many of these in base/root words, thanks to English's large vocabulary and the fact that, of course, no language uses words completely literally and everything can be a metaphor or implication anytime one wishes. For example: pluvial - pluvia hound (dog) - hundo paper - papero to comprehend - kompreni The main difference is that, once a word becomes a compound word, it usually ceases to look the same as English. Also there are cultural implications of certain words that are different from country to country, so they aren't always the same in Esperanto. This is especially true because Esperanto is least known about in the English-speaking world, and English's effect on Esperanto is actually very minimal compared to most other languages (ex. only 20% of translations into Esperanto come from English; other languages tend to be more like 60-80%). But here are synonyms with shades of meaning in Esperanto that correspond to synonyms with shades of meaning in English, yes. You didn't ask about it, but I figure you're probably wondering - Esperanto has made "neologisms", slang, and sometimes has its own special implications on words. For example, a "green pope" is someone who talks about Esperanto constantly (green is the "colour of Esperanto"). A "necessary-place" is a toilet/bathroom. There are also verbs and so on named after people, this is equivalent to saying "he's a Marxist", or "a McCarthy-ism", where the name of a certain famous person has taken on a particular meaning; only of course Esperanto has its own famous Esperanto speakers it takes the names from. Outright slang words are relatively few as it would complicate the language too much, but there are also unique meanings strongly implied with certain words that are only known to people who know Esperanto and/or its history (which, frankly, is most Esperanto speakers). As mentioned by the other person who replied, if you really want to know it you have to learn it (you don't have to become fluent even). It's honestly very fast to learn, all you need to do is get a dictionary like this one which has a list of prefixes and suffixes, then look up words on the online dictionary on lernu.net (which often breaks them into their compounds too). 

Correct me if I misunderstood your question. Assuming that you refer to a fixed combination of morphemes, e.g., fixed root, derivational morphemes, and inflectional morphemes, just as in German (as a 2nd person singular present indicative form of lexeme). What you are talking about seems to be simply , morphologically unparsed, or . Specifically answering your question, whether is: 

The phenomenon is called Consonant Clusters. They exist in quite a few languages, including the ancient ones. With the course of language's evolution, contraction may occur, effectively changing the phonetic value of these clusters. English 

As for the list of consonants and the meanings of the words, the Wikipedia article seems to be a good source: 

I am affiliated with a company that develops a formatting engine, so let me tell how we do it in printing industry. The decision point comes from an understanding of Unicode sequence, and difference of RTL (Right-to-Left) Unicode sequences to a plain text. In a Unicode text, you will have the following sequence of character codes. E.g., , then space and quotation mark, and then the string "פעילות הבינאום" in their natural, RTL, order: 

The answer is, the case system can help avoid ambiguity, but it is not a silver bullet. From the functional standpoint, the example sentence is actually two distinct phrases: 

Height (openness): how far the tongue is from the roof of the mouth Front/back: "horizontal" tongue position in the mouth Roundness: amount of rounding the lips 

In general, vowel backness (as well as all the other attributes) is not the property of a certain language. It's because of the nature of the human vocal tract. This way, each vowel sound produced has a certain backness (as well as the other features). However, languages use different mappings of phones to phonemes. In other words, each point on a vowel diagram is not a point, but rather an area. Everything that falls into that area is mapped to a certain phoneme. There are plenty of languages that do not distinct backness (on IPA vowel diagram, it looks like an area occupying the whole width of the diagram). For example: Polish "mysz" (mouse) . Different speakers may actually say or , but a listener would map it to an existing phoneme, . German "bitte" (please) Greek "ακακία" (acacia) There is yet another consideration. Although some languages lack cardinal central vowels, those vowel appear in a spoken language due to various phonetic phenomenons (of course, individual for every language). For instance, it's a common effect of centralization/reduction of unstressed vowels in Russian: "молоко" (milk) Note that this word contains three "o", the last one in stressed, and two unstressed ones are reduced in different ways. "этот" (this) Note that (front mid) in this word, regardless of stress, is often pronounced (central mid). 

Update. One more thing, it seems to be related. This observation came to me when I was listening to Chinese and Thai songs. Compare: 

You may find a comprehensive list of Greek consonant clusters here. Thai also has consonant clusters and they are often reduced in informal speech. Most notably, , , , and are retracted to and , correspondingly:
