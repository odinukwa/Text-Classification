I seem to recall reading something that said if the density of the universe was off by as little as one atom per cubic meter, the universe, as we know it, would not exist; one less and there wouldn't have been enough gravity to form galaxies and stars, one more and there would have been too much matter. (I don't know (or remember) what would have happened in the case of too much matter.)If I Google the title of this question, all I get is stuff about the expansion of the universe, nothing about whether or not it would exist. I've tried other variations but can't seem to find anything.Did I grossly misinterpret this? If not, does anyone know of any articles that can confirm or refute this? 

I was reading about gigantic storms on giant gas planets, the great red spot on Jupiter and hexagon on Saturn to name a few, how about our Sun which is consist of plasma(hot gas which have some of their electrons stripped) why don't we see any big hurricane? 

I know that virtual particles are constantly be created and annihilated even in a complete vacuum, I like to know if there exist such a mechanism to spawn an anti-particle black hole can be any size not necessary stellar? I think black hole lose mass by gradually throwing out one of the pair of virtual particles before they could cancel out each other, so would this also apply to an anti-particle black hole as well if it does exists? 

I was looking at the answer provided by Andy and the comments attached to it, and together they add up to a reasonable answer.There are several ways to measure a day, the two most common are sidereal and solar. A sidereal day is the time it take earth to rotate 360Â°; a solar day is the amount of time it takes the earth to rotate such that the sun appears at the same meridian as the day before. (Sunrise and sunset aren't really good references, as they are influenced by atmospheric conditions that affect refraction.) The solar day, or more accurately the mean solar day, is the day our calendars measure. The mean solar day is exactly what it says, the average amount of time during the course of a year that it takes for the sun to appear over the same meridian from day to day.Unfortunately, the definition of a sidereal day is very often given as the definition of a day, which is totally inaccurate, and very confusing.The length of the solar day varies during the year because the of Earth's distance from the sun; it is closer in January and farther in July. Because it is closer in January; it is also moving faster, which means that the planet has to rotate more for the sun to appear over the same meridian.If you can get your head around this, the concept really isn't very complicated. 

If primordial black hole do exists today could it be responsible for galaxies maybe even quasars, I mean these ancient monsters gobble up all materials in its wake and grow bigger and eventually evolves into say milky way galaxy etc. What are the odds of such events actually happened? 

Is there any naturally occurring event powerful enough that can cause a galaxy regardless of shape and size to divide itself into two or more smaller galaxies? 

Suppose in a binary stars system there is a dying star and a companion black hole as they orbit around each other. My question is what will possibly happen to the black hole if the partner goes supernova? I understand that the kinetic energy from the supernova cannot destroy the black hole. 

There are several ways to measure a year. The time it takes for Earth to complete one orbit around the sun is called a sidereal year or 365.256363 days, and though it is a valid definition of a year, it is not the one our calendars measure, which is a tropical year. A tropical year is defined "as the period of time for the mean ecliptic longitude of the Sun to increase by 360 degrees," and is 365.24219 days in length. One way to think of the tropical year is the length of time it takes for the sun to complete its north-south journey through our sky.There is a decent discussion of the various definitions of a year at Wikipedia. It's worth a read if you're interested. 

I would like to know, how strong would the gravity be from the distant universe if we were somehow able to remove half of it. For example, if everything behind us did not exist, how strongly would the stuff in front of us be pulling? By distant, let us consider everything beyond 10 billion light years (e.g. remove all the closer stuff). How many G's acceleration would I experience (discounting the fact that I would be in free fall and wouldn't feel it)? 

Is there any known pair of objects tidally locked with each other? I know the moon is tidally locked with the earth (e.g. one side always facing earth), but I don't know of any pair of objects that are both tidally locked with each other. For example, the planet would be tidally locked with the moon, and the moon would be tidally locked with the planet. 

Not all galaxies are spiral in shape[1][2], some nebulae are huge[3] and nebula are the nursery of stars[4]. How to tell them apart? Note I have already compare the contents for galaxy and a nebula, they are very similar as both have stars, planets and dusts. 

Since there are a lot of stellar black holes estimate to be around 100 millions alone in our milky way galaxy, maybe this facts might help explain the missing dark matter and I'll go even further... the energy produced by the collapsing stars and colliding black holes might be whats driving the expansion of space to speed up! otherwise why wouldn't it be? 

What does the current theory tell us about what is going on at the core of a neutron star, I'm expecting a black hole hopefully I won't be disappointed! 

Sunrise and sunset times are based on when an observer at the location in question would see the first or last limb of the sun appear or disappear; they do not take into consideration the light-speed delay between the Earth and the sun. They do, however, take into consideration the average refraction of the atmosphere, so sunrise occurs a bit earlier than plain line-of-sight would predict as would sunset occur a bit later. 

Depending on how one defines "quickly" and "significantly," I think a gravitational influence strong enough to do that would tear apart the Earth through tidal effects long before the change in orbit would make the planet unsuitable for life. 

I am probably going to get slammed for this, because it violates everything we were taught about tidal forces, but the antipodal tide is caused by the centrifugal force created by the Earth's rotation about the earth/moon barycenter, not differential gravitational forces. While the moon's gravity is less on the side of the earth furthest from it, that force is still towards the moon, not away from it.There is a good explanation of this centrifugal force explanation on NOAA's website here. I'll cite some pictures and pertinent text, but this site is a good read for anyone trying to understand the forces responsible for the Earth's tides.Here is a diagram showing the earth and moon's movement around the system's barycenter:And some of the pertinent text: 

Say hypothetically an UMBH with 50 billion solar masses (supposedly upper limit) is beginning to merge with another (Super)MBH similar to Sagittarius A* that sits at the center of the Milky Way Galaxy, what would happen next in this clash of the titans? 

Andromeda Galaxy is the largest galaxy in the galaxy cluster[1] called Local Group[2] and our Milky Way Galaxy as well as some satellite/dwarf galaxies are orbiting around each other within Local Group. My question isn't Milky Way Galaxy supposed to orbit around Andromeda Galaxy[3] so how come the predicted merger[4]? Whose slowing down or do the gravity work differently as things are being scaled further up? 

I read that after LIGO and Virgo interferometers detected gravitational waves signal from a kilonova, many ground based telescopes quickly turns their mirrors towards the spot and "sees" gold and platinum ,etc other heavy elements over the next few days. Is it really possible to directly observe heavy elements being formed consider that the event occurs at a distance of around 130 millions light year away?
