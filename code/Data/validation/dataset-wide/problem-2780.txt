One also notes that Hume gleefully applies the new critical spirit endemic to the then new science to empirical phenomena to deny cause & effect and stall the scientific project. It took Kant to restart it by injecting human consciousness into the world and distinguishing a phenomenal realm where science can happen and the noumenal realm on which we have no purchase. In fact, a similar argument to Humes was also applied by the Islamic Theologian Al-Ghazali against the rationalists of his time - the Falsafas. He invoked Allah so that cause & effect happened. In Christian philosophy, say for example as elucidated in Leibnizs Monadology, the infinite substance he identifies as God. It is uncreated & eternal. To prove this is entirely beside the point, which Kant points out. It's a position taken up, in the same way one may say there is a void set. The reasoning here is axiomatic. To then ask - well what created that substance - contradicts that first assertion. It's a stepping outside of that framework. This is rather like reasoning with Set Theory but then deciding to change the meaning of the membership relationship. 

Unfortunately the article is missing the citation where this comes from. Does anyone have a reference where this is more fully discussed? One reason as to why I'm interested in alternate readings is because as Deleuze said: 

In the Isha-Upanishad, it is noted that two forms of knowledge have to be yoked together; yoked is translated by yoga; in Yeats translation we have: 

QM is in one sense a continuation of an antique idea - that of atomism - that what there is, is made of particles; the 'quantum leap' was to recognise that energy is too; in fact everything other than space and time - and it's an open question if they are too: the results of Loop Quantum Gravity posit that it is - and it's the departure point for Causal Set Theory. Standard formal logic accepts that just one contradiction renders the entire theory trivial - in that every possible proposition is both at once true and false - this is unacceptable as then we have no criteria to discriminate between propositions; this is called the principle of explosion in that one contradiction 'explodes' the logic. Paraconsistent logics adjust formal logic such that this 'explosion' of doesn't occur; that this is a live option is shown in that there is such a thing as intuitionistic logic - where the law of the excluded middle no longer holds, and has both an associated set theory and algebra - Heyting algebra. The original Von Neumann & Birkhoff notion of Quantum Logic introduced as an explanatory factor for Quantum Logic itself has persisted into quantales, and more recently into linear type theory - this is where it makes contact with intuitionistic methods. In the same way that Quantum Mechanics has invigorated the study of non-classical algebra, that is algebra in which the commutation rule doesn't hold; then one can say it has also invigorated the study of non-classical logics. One noticeable effect is the notion of truth; whereas the classical notion is simply to draw on 'platonic' ideas of truth/falsity; the intuitionistic is to that truth, is only truth when it's justified - that is its proveable - a notion that goes back to Platos Theatatus; this makes its logic dynamic and kinetic. 

Does this mean that he regards the world being that of propositions whose truth can be determined - that is a fact. Presumably this is his definition of the world. Also, where does this leave the world of things? 

Your question is a little confusing - but I'll give it a go. I think the substantative part of what you're asking is this: 

He considers this as not fact, as such; or beyond contesting; he introduces the possibility that chance plays a part during the life of natural kinds; and not at the beginning: 

Solving all problems of the world by a single principle, in Pascals framing is 'mathematical' where such usage is not correct, and is an abuse of this kind of thinking; the thinking that is appropriate to moral considerations is according to Pascal, the second kind - intuitive where it takes into accont principles 'numerous' and 'subtle'. The argument by your friend is obviously wrong, in the way identified by Plato in the Sophist; though to be fair to this tradition one might suggest dealing with an argument of this type as a kind of training in rhetoric and debate. It's also a doctrine that's allied with the 'survival of the fittest' in Social Darwinism: one could argue that killing someone who is hungry is simply doing what Nature would have done; except of course one consciously applied this principle in a disciplined and directed way; which isn't how the principle of selection works. As a possible counter-argument you could use Rawls veil of ignorance which he used in his construction of utilitarian ethics in a Kantian mode: Suppose before you were born you were allowed to give the world one law, and suppose this law that you give is that the hungry shall be killed. But in exchange for this power you could be born anywhere at any time; and it turns out that you are born in Ethiopia during the great famine; and due to your proscription no aid is sent... Another possible solution is that this is no solution because certain background assumptions are made in a moral problem of this kind which are generally accepted; and an argument which violates these background assumptions in a way is playing outside the rules; or just breaking them. To take a prosaic example: I show you a bag, and say that inside this bag there is some money; you opens it and you look inside it and see that the bag is in fact empty; so you say 'I thought you said there was some money in there'; and I reply, 'well some is a number, and a number could be zero; and in fact, here, it is zero'. This argument violates the background assumption that in discourse of this kind that some means not nothing and not everything. A final possibility, I would suggest it is that the problem is not being solved but being eliminated. There is a difference between the two. One might eliminate dealing with this particular moral problem by eliminating your friend - but that's probably uncalled for. Note: there are theories of violence; for example the doctrine of just war; or in Weber, violence is a monopoly of the state - domestic (police) and foreign (army). 

Is there is difference between being singular and first? It appears to me that there is - though both notions can be described by the figure of '1'. Here what I mean by singular - it has no successors, nor any predecesors; to be exact - it is not a part, or a term. But can mathematics actually describe the singular? Is it always forced to move from the singular to the first? It appears that whenever mathematics discovers what appears to be a singular notion, it can embed it within a framework where it is no longer singular but a part of a multiple. That is it becomes a part of a sequence of which it is the first term. An easy example is the integers. A more sophisticated example are vector spaces. So can mathematics describe 1 as the singular? Perhaps one may cautiously advance the trivial group as the embodiment of unity; but this group can be embedded in any number of groups, in fact all. So again its part of a sequence or really a geometry here. 

But, probably most appositely here: zeitgeist (the spirit (geist) of the time (zeit) - a notion taken from Hegel). Consider too, the poem Second Coming by Yeats: 

True; but it may make no sense ie 1+1+1... adds up to what? or 1+(-1)+1+(-1)... or 1+2+3+4... One can observe that [1+(-1)]+[1+(-1)]+...= 0+0+0...=0 And that 1+[(-1)+1]+[(-1)+1]+... = 1+0+0+... = 1 This shows that infinite sums are dependent on how you sum them, this is against the associative law in finite sums; a property that one wants to conserve. Furthermore, certain infinite sums, (I think to Euler who first showed this) sum to different values if they were re-arranged; this is against the commutat8ive law for finite sums; again a property that one wants to conserve. 'Countable additivity' is a term usually used in measure theory; it is a fact, that using Dirac measures that the theory of 'infinite sums' as usually understood is subsumed measure theory; countable additivity is a general feature of measure theory (there is a theory also using finite additivity); and in the context of 'infinite sums' it ends up as the limits of a sequence of partial sums. (I don't view this as being of particularly philosophical import - its an important but technical result in the theory). 

There are twelve categories, arranged into four parts; Modality I've explained above; another is Quantity, under which redness is a Unity, or in older language a Universal; the third category is that of Relation, and under this redness relates to substance, in older language (Platonic) it is a Form. Thus redness is a synthesised, and thus impure concept of the Understanding; which is a actual and universal; and is a form (of substances). And this is what we mean by a qualia derived from sensibility, from actual empirical experience. 

so, gravity which causes an apple to fall, must have the capacity to cause motion, and the apple must have the capacity to be moved; and when quantified, the former is named gravitational potential energy, and latter kinetic energy. When eventually, this is understood as not action at a distance, but action by contact, we have the concept of the field: Maxwells EM field, and then latterly Einsteins adoption of the concept for gravity. This surely has been utility enough ... Is it worth adding that the terms potential and kinetic are of Latin and Greek provenance; presumably we can take it that those who first theorised and thought through these terms - read the A to see what lies concealed there, and not over and above them - looking for refutations and objections. Or, indeed scribbling red and green gargoyles on them. Or, not knowing how to draw, coloured in or doodled over the letters in a pointlessly thoughtlessly way. Or, now - in the merely now - by the pressing and pushing of buttons. This being, the way of some. 

Sorge thus unifies three features (or dimensions) of time: existentiality or being-ahead-of-itself, facticity or being-already-in-a-world and falling or being-alongside with others. Thus future, past and present; thus 'temporality reveals itself to be the sense of authentic care'. Thus time in Heidgger relates not to the linear Newtonian dimension of ceaselessly regular and objective flow - physical time; nor to the cosmological cyclical time of the Vedas but of being here now, with a past behind us, a present at-hand, and a future ahead of us; and this is understood for an I, a You, a They and We and not for things.
