Your boss is likely referring to certain corporate cultural norms of the organization that are related to aspects of the people who are in charge. This is best answered with an example: For instance, let's say you're working for a family business. The owner if the business may have his/her children, or other relatives, working there in the organization. As a non-relative, you may find that certain family members don't necessarily have to follow the same rules you do, or that the criteria for evaluating employees is not quite so objective. In such a situation, due to "political" reasons, you may be unable to complain to your boss about your boss's son, for instance, who may get away with less work or more perks without necessarily having more skills or organizational knowledge. This same example could be applicable to employees who have been at the company longer than you have. In some corporate cultures, such employees may be afforded certain advantages that are unreachable to you as a new employee. Wikipedia does a great job of defining Workplace Politics: 

One thing you might consider, that no one else has mentioned yet, is to talk to your Human Resources department. Many times companies will have policies in place against solicitation without specific approval, and it's possible that this could fall within that category. One way to avoid being put on the spot could be to see if HR can enforce this policy by sending out an email that highlights any policy on the matter. For instance, perhaps HR could insist that the people soliciting money must leave an anonymous donation box in the break room. This gives people who wish to participate an opportunity to do so without exposing those who don't wish to do so, for whatever reason. So, contact HR and ask if there's a policy on solicitation. In most cases, your conversations with HR should be confidential, so even if there is nothing they can do, this could help you avoid looking like the bad guy. Of course, one challenge is that people seem to like the idea of the whole exercise seeming like a surprise, despite the fact that many people have become very good at remembering the exact date on which they were born. To solve this problem, break the collecting of money up into monthly cycles. In January, put the donation box in and announce it's for February birthdays. In February, mark it March. Use the money collected for each month for the birthdays that occur in that month. People know when their birthday is coming, so it can't really be that much of a surprise, especially if this is the culture. ;) And if people stop donating, then the whole birthday buying idea just might die altogether, and you still win! Or rather, you're niece wins and gets her barbie doll, without sending Uncle Bytebuster to the poor house! ;) 

Having a great Knowledge Management solution could help solve the problems you've mentioned. Your problem is less about professional mentoring and more about actual job training. A knowledge management solution could involve an editable Wiki, Google Site, Google Docs, or other platforms where you can document procedures. A good knowledge management ticketing system like Zendesk or a Wordpress theme like nowLedge. Additionally, some tasks are better described using audio and video. Many organizations are turning to Youtube and video recording software to capture training sessions. Additionally, screen capture software like CamStudio or Captivate may help record activities on the screen for later educational use. You say much of the training is repetitive. If that is the case, then I agree with senior management. Keep in mind that many startups are on a budget. Every cent counts and must be put towards activities that will pay dividends. Use a combination of these methods to achieve your goals while still avoiding the wastefulness of repetitive tasks. 

Creating a culture of punctuality may take time and may be something you have to compromise on somewhat. Since you're dealing with intelligent knowledge workers, you'll be more successful if you can get them to buy into the plan. Instead of focusing on the time, focus on the problem created by the scheduling issues. Present the problem as a challenge to the team and see what they come up with. The answer may be set schedules or it may be something different that solves the problem. It may be Monday, Wednesday, Friday are the 9am-sharp days while Tuesday and Thursday are the flex days. While the plan may not be perfect nor will it be exactly what you envisioned, finding a middle ground somewhere that will make both the development team happy, as well as solve the actual problem will prevent your staff from becoming bitter and seeing you as the enemy. Keep in mind that you're not dealing with a manufacturing process where everyone must show up at exactly 9:30am, when the whistle blows, so they can begin the mind-numbing task of assembling the same little plastic widgets repeatedly, until the whistle blows again, and the mind-numbed staff make their way out to the local bar for happy hour. 

Consider that in many job descriptions there oftentimes exists the following additional requirement: 

If you've been invited to a meeting where everyone in the room is a manager, then you're likely there because you have a lot to contribute. Therefore, if an issue arises which you're an expert on, you should definitely speak up and contribute to the discussion. Although you're in a room with managers, you're also in a room full of people who are all there to solve a problem. Therefore, think of yourself as a problem solver as well. There may be times when, by keeping silent, the group has lost what could have been a valuable contribution from you, while at other times you've spoken and proposed what may be a not-so-hot idea. In the latter case, not much has been lost. Ideas that aren't good or that aren't ready to be implemented today are generally just forgotten. Your managers should appreciate the times when you've helped solve a problem, and even bad ideas show you're trying to problem solve. The area where you may need to be careful is in terms of how you talk to these people. Respect should go both ways. Your managers should treat you with respect in these meetings, and you should treat them with respect as well. If a manager poses a solution that you have concerns about, focus not on the ways the idea is bad. Instead, focus on ideas that solve the problem. In other words, as others have said, don't make anyone look bad, regardless of whether they're a coworker in your department or another manager. Leadership doesn't require titles, and if you can communicate on the same level with your managers, you'll highlight your leadership, problem solving, and relationship building skills, which may help you move into positions of more responsibility. 

I come from the line of thinking that, when boundaries are crossed, the time to address the issue is immediately. In the case of this person asking where I'm going to be sitting, I would probably say, without getting emotional, rude, or confrontational, the following statement: 

Basically, a contract role is more likely to be one where you're treated somewhat like an employee of the organization but on a more temporary basis. Whereas a permanent role is one that continues indefinitely. For clarification purposes, an independent contractor would be more like a freelancer, consultant, or self employed worker. Whereas a contract position is one where you're treated as a temporary employee. Some contract jobs can turn into permanent positions whereas some have a clear and definitive end date. Some employers use contract positions to determine if a candidate fits the culture of the organization and would be a good long term investment. This makes it easier to terminate the employment when the contract ends, if the employee isn't a good fit. There's a great TechRepublic article called "The Difference Between Contracting and Consulting" that defines what a contractor is: 

First, it's good to hear that you're concerned with doing the right thing when it comes to being reliable in the eyes of both employers. That says a lot about who you are as a person today and what type of person you'll be tomorrow. It seems that you'd owe the most to the company you're currently with, and since the grass is greener on the other side, you have an advantage right now. You're current employer offered to match the offer made by the other employer, which now changes your decision. All things being equal, you know what it's like working with your current employer. If you enjoy the work, you may want to stay on with them and enjoy the new opportunities they'll offer you. To avoid burning bridges with the new employer, you could have a discussion with them. Instead of making the decision now, mention to them that your current employer just offered to match their offer, and because of that, you're thinking about staying on with them because you really enjoy the company and the work. Ask them for a couple days to think about the decision. Strategically, this may give them an opportunity to counter-offer yet again, which may affect your decision. If not, they should understand, as salary is important. As long as you're honest, give them plenty of notice, then that door should be open to you in the future once you outgrow your current employer. If they don't handle this well and act unprofessional, then you may want to question whether or not you'd want to work there in the first place. If the new employer does handle your decline well and understands the situation, keep in touch with anyone whom you've met there. Those contacts may be important in the future. Whatever you decide to do, just remember to be honest, professional, and respect all parties involved. Good luck! 

You're right that this can be both a good and a bad thing, and the results depend on two factors, your behavior, which you can control, and your family's behavior, which you cannot control. To avoid creating an awkward environment, it's best to stay professional and keep conversations work-related. Most of the sibling co-workers and parent/child co-workers I've known don't put the spotlight on their status. They leave the family drama at home and remain professional. The focus is on the work. In places where the business isn't family owned, unless you talked to these people, you wouldn't know they were family. When you're an employee and not part of the the owner's family, the drama tends to be nonexistent because your jobs, and the amount of respect you get, may depend on it. In family owned businesses, these rules are out the window, as I've observed that there's more family drama in these establishments, which can make it awkward for a non-family member who gets caught in the middle of any drama. Lucky for you, it sounds like your in-laws are simply colleagues, and not descendants of the owner. To help set the tone of professionalism from the beginning, you may want to call your father in law by his name if you'll be working in a corporate or medium to larger sized business. Calling him "Dad" in the office may be awkward and may draw attention to a power dynamic that exists in the family but that doesn't exist in the workplace. If it's a smaller organization where everyone knows everyone, then this might make things more awkward. You may want to discuss this with him prior to the first day so there are no surprises. On the first day, you might find it helpful to keep your conversations with them short and work-related. You'll likely be kept busy by your manager with introductions and overviews of what you'll be doing, and you don't want to appear distracted by socializing. Once you get settled in and get a feel for the office culture, you may find different ways of handling your interactions with your in-laws and determine whether or not casual conversation can include family business. Just make sure you don't make anyone else feel uncomfortable or allow yourself to feel uncomfortable. 

I remember being in the Army doing manual labor tasks. The people doing manual labor always looked like they were working. It's easy to spot. Even if you're not an expert in whatever work is being done, you don't need to be to see the work happening. The people who were fortunate enough to get selected to do office work were of course looked down on, not only by other soldiers but also by non-commissioned officers (Sergeants, for instance). The office work wasn't programming. It involved keeping track of personnel records and meeting deadlines in terms of having things ready for inspections, but this wasn't something where an uneducated outsider could look in and see that "work" is being done. Most likely, the people you're working with in the warehouse can't even begin to fathom what it is that you do. This is of course a gross generalization, but chances are that a significant number of those folks just haven't spent enough time around computers. However, putting this assumption aside, one thing you could try to do is maybe talk the boss into letting you do a little knowledge sharing. There's likely people out there who can get what you do, at least on a very high level, enough to where you might gain a few allies. I've worked in places where, for instance, someone with a very specific knowledge-set might give a presentation or hold a workshop to teach others. If you get people who are even just mildly curious, you might be able to possibly show them enough to where -- when they see you sitting behind a computer for hours on end -- they'll know that you are doing real work. Consider the following items for your presentation:
