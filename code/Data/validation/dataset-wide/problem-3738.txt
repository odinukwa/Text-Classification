Given a Markov process among a (possibly infinite) set of states $S$, with possibly infinite depth (that is, the transition probabilities from $s_i \to s_j$ at time $t$ are permitted to depend not only on the state at time $t-1$ but also on all previous states). Say the initial state is $\sigma_0$ and for some specific infinite sequence of target states $\{\sigma_i\} | i \in \Bbb{N}$ it has been proven that for all $i$ and all possible paths leading to $\sigma_i$, state $\sigma_i$ almost surely transitions to state $\sigma_{i+1}$ in finite time. Does that necessarily imply that the process will a.s. traverse the entire (possibly infinite) chain of target states? (Obviously, if the chain is infinite, we cannot ask for traversing the chain in a finite number of time steps.) Or if that implication does not hold, can you show a counterexample? An example of this sort of problem is a depth-1 random walk on a 2-d grid, with the target chain $\sigma_i = (i,0)$. Here each state $\sigma_i$ a.s. reaches $\sigma_i+1$ (but the expected time of first transition is infinite). And it can be shown that in fact the process does visit each point in the chain sequentially, a.s. Of course, one example does not prove the implication! 

As far as I know, a generalisation of Poincare duality for Lie algebra cohomology over rings is given in M. Hazewinkel, "A duality theorem for the cohomology of Lie algebras" Math. USSR-Sb. , 12 (1970) pp. 638–644. There is a large literature on cohomology of Lie algebras. Here is a very short list of articles and books: C. Chevalley, S. Eilenberg, Cohomology theory of Lie groups and Lie algebras, Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 63 (1948), 85-124. G. P. Hochschild, J.-P. Serre, Cohomology of Lie algebras, Ann. of Math. 57 (1953), 591-603. J.

As to variant (A), it of course (at least in two dimensions) will a.s. become trapped for large $t$, so it is not immediately obvious that $d_A(t)$ grows even as fast as $d_0(t)$. 

Counterexample: Let $n=1, a_1 = 1, f(t) = -t$. Then $y(t) = t$ which is a continuous increasing function of $t$. Did you mean to say increasing? Because in that case, the conjecture is true in intervals where $y(t)$ is strictly greater than zero. 

This is a counterexample because $$ \frac23 \frac{|\Sigma|^2}{|\partial\Sigma|} = \frac23 \cdot \frac{1^2}{6} + O(\epsilon) = \frac19 + O(\epsilon) > \frac5{48} $$ I'm not sure, but your inequality might hold for convex open sets (which have smooth boundaries). 

For an example, let $N$ be a compact complex hypersurface of degree $m+1$ of the complex projective space $\mathbb{CP}^m$ with complex dimension $m\ge 3$ (for $m=3$ this is a complex $K3$ surface). The first Chern class of $N$ vanishes, and hence $N$ admits a Ricci-flat but nonflat Riemannian metric, by a theorem of Yau. 

One can also show with Fermat's last theorem that $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational - the answer of mt did $2^{1/n}$ for $n\ge 3$. Suppose that $\sqrt{2}$ is rational. Then there is a right-angled triangle with rational sides $(a,b,c)=(\sqrt{2},\sqrt{2},2)$ and area 1. Hence $1$ would be a congruent number. This contradicts Fermat's last theorem with exponent $4$. 

The naive method of just evaluating $$f(M) = M\log\left(1+\frac{M}{\sum_{i=1}^M\frac{1}{x_i}}\right)$$ is an $O(N)$ algortithm. Since one can, by choosing $$x_N = 1 \\ x_{N-k} = 1+(k-1)\epsilon \text{ when } n-k > m_0 \\ x_{N-k} = k+1 \text{ when } n-k \geq m_0 \\ $$ with $\epsilon$ sufficiently small always adjust the $\{x_i\}$ such that to the optimum value of $M$ is at the arbitrarily chosen $m_0$, there can be no algorithm that is better than $O(N)$ (that is, no "not-iterative" solution). 

Mathematical software almost never defines the result of integer operations in terms of "round to nearest". For example, in C, C++, Fortran, etc. the result of dividing a positive integer by another positive integer always rounds downward. (IN general, the rule in those languages is "round toward zero." If forced to provide a complex template specialization in C++, I would hold my nose and stick with that convention, rounding both the real and imaginary parts toward zero. Thus $$\frac{4-11i}{3-2i} "=" 2-i$$ because $\frac{34}{13}$ "rounds" to $2$ and $-25/13$ "rounds" to $-1$. 

In the semisimple case it is really easy to calculate $ext_A^i(M,N)$, $i\ge 1$, with the above assumptions. It is zero. For Koszul rings this is almost true, i.e., $ext^i(M,N)$ is concentrated in degree $i$ (that is, if $S$ is the direct sum of all simples, then the two natural gradings on the algebra $A^{!}=ext^{\bullet}(S,S)$ coincide). It seems reasonable that the authors had this in mind as they wrote: "Morally a Koszul ring is a graded ring that is as close to semisimple as a $\mathbb{Z}$-graded ring possibly can be”. This was already said in the comments. I can just add another reference here, a discussion on Koszul algebras and Koszul duality, which explains several things and refers also to the paper of Beilinson, Ginzburg and Soergel, here: $URL$ 

The answer is that a point $p$ can participate in $5k$ circles. The construction demonstrating that $p$ can be in $5k$ circles (that is, it can be the 5-th nearest neighbor to $5k$ other points) is as follows: Place $p$ at the center of a regular pentagon of side length $L$. Place $q_1$ at one of the vertices; draw a circle $C_1$ centered at $q_1$ with radius $r_1 = d(p,q_1) + \epsilon_1$ (for some small positive $\epsilon_1$). Now mark the point $t_1$ on the line from $p$ to $q_1$ such that $d(p,t_1) = L$. And place $k-1$ points $\{ s_{11}, s_{12}\ldots\}$ along the line from $q_1$ to $p$ such that $$d(q_1, s_{1m}) = 2^{-m}(d(q_1,p)-\epsilon_1) $$ and commit to placing no other points inside $C_1$. Then for all $m, j < k$, $$d(s_1m,s_1j) < d(p, s_1m) \mbox{ and } d(q_1,s_1m,) < d(p, s_1m). $$ Thus (since we will not put any other points inside $C_1$) $p$ is the $k$-th nearest neighbor to each of the $k$ points $\{q_1, s_{11}, s_{12} \ldots \}$. Now place $q_2$ at a neighboring vertex of the pentagon, and construct $C_2$ centered at $q_2$ with radius $r_2 = d(p,q_2) + \epsilon_2$. While the line from $q_2$ to $p$ does intersect with the interior of $C_1$, the part of that line starting at $q_2$ and extending to length $\frac12 (d(p,q_2)-L)$ does not intersect $C_1$. Thus all the $s_{2m}$ are farther from all the $s_{1m}$ than they are from each other or from $p$ or $q_1$, and by the same argument as before, $p$ is the $k$-th nearest neighbor to each of the $k$ points $\{q_2, s_{21}, s_{22} \ldots \}$. Proceed in this fashion to place all five $q_j$, and you have constructed $p$ to be the $k$th nearest neighbor to each of $5k$ other points. Now, can we place $q$ to be the $k$-th nearest neighbor to at least $5k+1$ other points? The same reasoning that prevents (without allowing ties) a point from being the nearest neighbor to $6$ other points also prevents tightening the angular distances between the groups of $s_{1m}$ and $s_{2m}$, and we obviously could add no additional points on the line segments without dropping one of the $q_i$ from the list of points having $p$ as a $k$-th nearest neighbor. So the only approach to increasing the number would be to stagger the $s_{im}$ in angle, to try to make room for another point. I have a rather long and ugly proof that for $k=2$ you cannot be the second nearest neighbor to more than $10$ other points. The underlying reason is again that a (convex) hexagon must contain two points that are closer together than the distance between one of those points and a specified point in the interior. But I can't seem to handle the general case for $k>2$. 

Here is a remark, if $\chi$ is a quadratic character. Then there is a remarkable result of Gauss, saying that $$ G(\chi, N)=\begin{cases} \sqrt{N}, \;\text{ if } N\equiv 1 (4) \cr 0, \; \text{ if } N\equiv 2 (4) \cr i\sqrt{N} \; \text{ if } N\equiv 3 (4) \cr (1+i)\sqrt{N} \;\text{ if } N\equiv 0 (4) \end{cases} $$ So this rules out that $G(\chi, N)=-\sqrt{N}$. It took Gauss over $4$ years to prove this. A proof is in section $9.10$ of Tom Apostol's book on analytic number theory. For characters of higher orders $k>4$, I believe it is an open problem, which roots of unity can occur. If $\chi$ is a real, primitive Dirichlet character, then only $1$ and $i$ can occur (i.e., $\sqrt{N}$ or $i\sqrt{N}$). 

A simply-connected counterexample: Consider a unit square; round the corners by replacing them with quarter-circles of radius some tiny $\epsilon$. Now deform the top edge by cutting out the $4\epsilon$ segment centered at the top of the top edge, and replacing it with a line from the left of the cut, perpendicular to the top, extending to within $2\epsilon$ of the bottom side, plus a line of length $4\epsilon$ parallel to the top moving to the right, plus a line connecting the end of that segment with the right end of the cut-out segment on the top. Finally, use $\epsilon$ quarter-circle replacements to round all the right angles you have introduced. This gives an open simply-connected area with a smooth boundary. For very small $\epsilon$, the area looks like a square divided into two rectangles by a double-line edge douwn the middle. Then:
