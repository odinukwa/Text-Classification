This is how you should understand what a resume is & what a cover letter is: – A cover letter is a casual summary of who you are. - A resume is a dry list of employment history & achievements. Once you understand that, a cover letter will always make sense. A cover letter basically says the follow, “Hey, I heard of this opening & I thought I would apply. Here is a summary of who I am, what I current do & what my goals are.” A resume will never do that. A resume will just enforce the ideas presented in a cover letter, but it’s typically a chronological history of employment. And the main focus of a resume will be: What did you do in past jobs, what are specific achievements & how long did stay there. These items compliment each other. And when you interview for the position, your whole song & dance during that interview will most likely be an improvisation between you and the interviewer on the points in both. No one thing assures you will do better than others. But all of the items taken together—the cover letter, the resume & the interview—will paint a complete picture of who you are. Leave out a cover letter & the message sent is, “This person simply sees this as a job & paycheck… Do we want to deal with that?” Which is not the impression you want to make. 

Your problem is you have scoped this issue as spanning two extremities: Either the customer is “satisfied” by having the problem solved or you see Brian’s response to being told it can’t easily be solved as throwing him “under the bus.” Look, sometimes the absolute best way to keep a customer satisfied is 100% pure honest. And going to Brian and saying, “Look, I did my best to communicate the issue… Please let Derek know…” is not throwing anyone under a bus. If somehow your relationship with Brian is strained by an interaction like this, then you have bigger issues to deal with. In fact, I would explicitly state to Brian the following: 

Depends. But you are overthinking this. In your case you might have interviewed with 8 people but maybe only a few people there will actually have any weight in the decision. For all you know they cold collectively arm-wrestle for their candidate. Which is me basically saying: There is no one set method to getting stuff like this done. Everyone meets with a candidate, shares an opinion on what they saw or felt & that’s about it. I will say I would be shocked if this was based on voting. That becomes nasty when you are in a small group of people. Ever sit on a jury? Nobody wants that kind of realness for a hiring process. In my experience things like this are structured, but casual and usually the people most directly connected to the position will have the most weight. 

Depends on you age & experience when you did what you did. But you have to realize something: How exactly do you think people protect systems from intrusion other than to see how the intrusion tools work? “White hat” hackers are a valuable commodity. And—like I mention—age plays a factor: Most school courses on programming are not cutting edge even if they are good. It’s a good sign if you interview for a job & show a natural curiosity. Heck, I learned more typing in BASIC programs from magazines like COMPUTE & SoftSide back in the day than I learned in any course. Past all of that, it’s almost expected that you explored computers via hacking: This field changes so much from day-to-day it makes more sense to explore the world on your own—and reverse engineer cool new tools—than wait for some stodgy book to come out a few years later. You know that Steve Jobs & Steve Wozniak where phone phreakers back in the day, right? Even before Apple started, that didn’t stop them from getting work or have respect shown to them for their skills. I never read one story on Apple where someone looked at Jobs and Wozniak and then said, “Hmmm… They are hackers! Can’t take the risk!” So yes, if you feel it is appropriate, you should mention your hacking exploit past. But be sure to put it in the context of the past. And why you were doing that at the time. 

One way is they see you as a valuable asset and understand you are going through a low time and will work with you and your supervisor to help. The other option as to what might happen is human resources will look at you as simply damaged goods. Meaning, the outcome of you telling them this us they might just decide to look for someone to replace you. 

So honestly if you still have access to the account, you might want to not only remove the account from your email programs but also—as a professional courtesy—contact someone at the company and give them a heads up about it. Be 100% honest that you still had access but don’t need it anymore and state something like, “I thought someone would have locked the account or at least changed the password after I left?” Be clear and transparent about this. 

Now, using a work computer for personal reasons might be a tenuous reason, but is it valid? Because in my mind it seems like you are trying to justify their dismissal of you during your probation period because of what happened at your previous position. It’s unclear what the full picture is, but my gut says you simply have been dealt two bad hands at employers at a time. With a situation in the first employer that seems to be 100% not your fault. And a situation with the second that might be caused by you, but again no clear picture. My advice? 10 months at one bad job and 2 weeks at another adds up to not much. If there is a way you can minimize the impact of that first job go for it. Don’t deny working for them, but basically tell any new potential employer the full deal. But I would recommend not having any future employers contact the past employer. But you mention the FBI, right? Do you have a contact there? Because my tact would be, “I worked for this place for 10 months. Then I resigned for reasons connected to an FBI investigation. I didn’t do anything wrong. If you wish to verify, please contact this FBI agent to vouch for me. I realize this might be unusual, but please realize that I’m being completely honest here & would like to work for your organization.” The key is that your employment history should state you worked for one place for 10 months, but your reference should be that of an FBI agent or someone similar who is not connected to that past company but can completely vouch for your situation. 

You should be open minded, assume good faith & let her work with you. You cannot presume you will change her hiring & a “well-respected / well-written explanation” adds up to not much. Assume good faith. But document all encounters. And you know what? For all you know, she could be very open minded about your work & can actually be an advocate for you when talking to your boss. So don’t assume the worst of a case like this. This could work in your favor. 

The only viable option I see is for all staff—and I mean 100% all staff—to stop working until these issues are addressed. But based on the mentality shown so far, it seems that if everyone left he’d just shrug & hire more people. Perhaps you can organize as a group & get a lawyer to force the situation? This is a tough call, but I would err on the side of sitting down & rationally working out what is happening with others in the company. For all you know there might be a mass exodus. Exponential growth in a company does not always mean there is a clear benefit to the on-the-ground workers like you. 

Enjoy that while it lasts! Seriously, what can you do other than correct them? Just don’t take it personally & let your work reflect your permanent status. Not much else can be said or done to force perceptions to change. Also, unclear on how this is being conveyed, but for all you know they could be screwing around with you. Perhaps it’s a light form of hazing. If so, don’t sweat it. Just roll with it. And perhaps figure out creative ways to convey they fact you are not an intern that will maybe win you over with the rest of the team quicker. 

Reading this is quite painful to me. A lot of computer work is invisible so even on a team we invest tons of heart and soul on simple things. But at the end of the day work you do not own yourself—and do for others—is truly just work. Here is the harsh reality: If they haven’t paid you yet, the chances of them paying you are slim to none. If you have a contract that stipulates pay, you might be able to legally leverage that in some way if things truly go south. But the reality is that even if you do—sorry to say—take the employers to court for back pay, you might only get a fraction back of what you are rightfully owed. Chances are if the company is failing, they will claim bankruptcy and there you go. 100% of nothing. Maybe the court would order them to—I don’t know—sell the chairs and coffee machine to pay back vendors. But then you are the end of a huge list of people owed. Meaning when you get something it might be so low it’s a joke and the check is best framed on the wall as such. Some might suggest equity, but I can show you tons of examples of that not working either for the same reason. Basically if you are not getting paid, the chances of equity are zilch. 

First, 100% of nobody will ever complain that you left a company for a better position. The key is how professionally you handle leaving & how polite you are to the previous company when you leave. The key is to not burn bridges. Don’t act in the heat of the moment. You might want to mention that seeing new hires come on board above you inspired you to look elsewhere, but don’t dwell on that at all. Let the company figure it out for themselves. If you feel that way, you can’t be the only one. But leaving a company for a better position & salary is the number 1 reason anyone leaves a company. So it’s not unusual at all as awkward as it might seem. 

To complete that sentence: “The impossible.” Realistically, you should take what they want you to do and divide it up into realistic chunks. Project manage your own tasks. Meaning, after 17 days what can you realistically present of the larger project that is viable even without completing the whole project. This to me is the best tact. Because realistically you—or anyone else—will not be able to complete the goals as outlined within 17 days. But if you can build a solid foundation that can then be built on, then while the formal deadline is not met you at least have a solid… Something… That can be built upon when reality hits the team 18 days from now. 

Do what I do: Wear earbuds. Not a choice for all, but the best solution if possible. Because if you are working in an open layout office environment, you can never really control your environment. That said, I would recommend talking to your supervisor but placing it in the context of you cannot get work done. And I am unclear about your office situation, but it might be best to request that your desk be moved elsewhere. If the topic of why, you can simply state, “My office mate is just an endless distraction.” For all you know you are not the first person to complain. Also if you are hesitant about being “one of those guys” who complains when things are not working well, then do the following: 

Yes. Your department’s work is being audited so who would better know the state of that work than your department. Also, since the act of performing an internal audit will naturally focus your department on the needs of auditing, the process can lead to overall proactive efficiencies. Let’s say you have a process that works well for you, but at the end of the day needs to be tweaked for auditing purposes. Well, now you know you have to alter your process moving forward & other team members do as well. 

This is all a dance. Everyone is reading between the lines. Understand the basics and you will be fine. But simply saying you want more money—an not mentioning anything else—makes you seem crude, crass and ready to leave the moment anyone shakes more money in front of your face. All that said, I will say that finance can be discussed bluntly if it is somehow well known public knowledge the old company was somehow cheap and the new company is on a financial upswing. But still, touch that topic lightly and delicately even if the conversation is clear and open. 

It’s not that you are being greedy. But you will sound flaky & possibly desperate. If you asked for $28,000, then that is what you have to deal with. But if you truly did get a competing offer it is worth mentioning only if they get back to you and want to hire you. Any contact you make now asking to pump the salary up to $30,000 will only make your chances worse at this stage. At this point your whole job should be to sit back, be cool & wait for a response. The waiting game sucks, but that is how this kind of stuff works. Also, if you have competing offers & the other offers are truly better, then don’t sweat it. Take what works for you & move on. 

It might not increase your chances of being hired, but if you don’t send one someone might ask, “Hey, anyone hear back from that other guy?” The reality is humans in a flurry of activity tend to forget things no matter how “on the ball” they are. A quick & simple thank you note won’t hurt. Just thank people for their time, express your interest in the position & hang tight.
