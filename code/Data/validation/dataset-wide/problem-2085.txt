There is free filtered water on my floor available from a 5-gallon water dispenser unit. The replacement water bottles are about 30 feet away in a storage room. As it would happen, I tend to find the water fountain completely empty more often than I would like. In the perfect world, the person who takes the last of the water would go and fetch a new cartridge, or if the person does not have the strength then he or she would ask someone else to do so. What should I do? Put up a poster saying "Thank you for drinking from this fountain. Are you doing your part in making sure we can all enjoy to drink as well?" 

I’m currently mentoring a junior engineer. He is indeed smart and driven but lacks the experience to be effective, as is customary for members of this rotation program at our r&d facility. My team is facing stringent deadlines and I do need his help with a different project, which could be decribed as a by-the-book engineering effort. The person’s current assignment is intended to be exploratory and somewhat advanced, yet the goals and deliverables are clear. The person is currently facing a complex task, which will likely take a couple of weeks to finish, mostly because of its research vibe. I could reassign the task to someone else or do it myself, possibly in one evening, yet I’d prefer the person to somehow do both: 1) learn on his own, struggle, but it in the end come out stronger and 2) have the person help me and the team deliver on the high priority task. There are some limitations: the person cannot do both tasks at the same time since thee first task needs to be wrapped up in the next few weeks. Dilution of his time would likely make the person miss the deadline. Thank you for insight. 

1 Do note that some US sources will claim the Fair Labor Standards Act was primarily a result of Fords research on productivity. This claim is mostly false and Fords 'research' was broader than just decreasing the 45 hour week to a 40 hour week as far more importantly he also doubled the wages of his workers 

A company I recently applied for a job at asked me to do a test-project during the recruitment process which would take 8 to 16 hours. My gut feeling is that this crosses the line for a test project (most technical interviews in my experience take at most around 2 hours), so I wondered, what's the maximum typical amount of time an unpaid test should take during recruitment? To be very clear here, I am not asking for opinions, what I am asking is for answers speaking either from research or extensive experience covering recruitment processes from a large number of companies. Something the answers currently give, but which I feel merits focus, as some (mostly close and down voters) are misreading the question as 'hey, how many hours do you like to spend on a test?'. 

The other two answers clearly seem to come from people who are not working for startups. In startups it's not uncommon for people to work 50 to more than 80 hours (random source backing this up) and this is part of what you're signing up for when you start working for a startup. On the upside of course you tend to get shares in the company and are directly invested in it's success which is the reason people are willing to work those hours in the first place. Practically speaking I have heard people suggest/joke you should not sign up for a startup unless you're single, which might be an exaggeration, but there is a core of truth there. The point is just that things like "Because I don't supervise them" are not a good excuse in any way, because that's not how the culture in startups works (and for that matter user52889's comment about productivity and 66 hour week isn't going to cut it either, simply because people who work in startups are people who can handle those kind of workloads (or end up quiting after getting overworked thus leaving only those who are able to handle those kind of workloads)). However this kind of organizational structure with an possibly unhealthy workload is something that employees should take upon themselves. Considering your boss is trying to pressure you into working even more hours I would definitely see that as a negative sign. For me personally 66 hours a week as a newlywed would already be the point where I would easily decide that I would rather quit (and if necessarily downscale or whatever), however the line is different for everyone as for example you seem fine with your 66 hours. In the end you just have to decide where your line is and see how your boss will take it, but if everybody starts staying in longer at some point or another then you will probably be in 'trouble'. Some recapping and extra explanation Just to be extra clear about what I am saying as there seems to be some confusion in the comments: 

I am currently talking to employers for hire in 5 months. I am open to the idea of moving across the country, but not fond of it. I have expressed my insecurity of living across the country to my potential employers. My stance is between "60/40" and "70/30" leaning towards relocation. To those who have managed the hiring process- on initial interviews, does that dissuade you from pursuing that candidate further? Edit: The relocation was Iowa to Texas. 

Tell you to deal with it. At that point, it is up to your best judgment to include or exclude F. Talk to F and hopefully spur a change in behavior. Remove F from your group and allow you to continue as a 2 person project. 

I have this reoccurring problem. It is 9/10/11am and I am at a meeting where I sit either one chair or two away from a large projector screen. With the fluorescent lights off, the screen is bright in a dark room. I get drowsy and my head feels heavy. My eyes go off in their own directions until I try to snap out of it. Typed words become illegible and challenging to try and read. I have noticed this in same behavior in a meeting where the projector was used while fluorescent lighting was left on. When we break, and I get a chance to walk around, I can snap out of it. What can I do to avoid it altogether? I eat breakfast each day, usually shortly after 7am. I get 6 to 8 hours of sleep. I sometimes drink coffee but it doesn't seem to help. I believe it is some sort of eye-strain related to sitting too close to the projector screen, but I don't know. What can I do to stay alert in meetings?
