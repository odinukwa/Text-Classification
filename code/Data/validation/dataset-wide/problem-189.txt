The most politically correct one would be the one selected by that minority group. In all cases of vernacular syntax, there's a wave of names that will be attributed to a certain group or groups. It follows a fairly recurring progression: 

Regardless of the size of the buildings, there has to be some basis on who actually lives in that space. In the Burj, no one lives in the tower, just the Y shaped base. If you're covering the planet with megastructures, and looking for the maximum number of people, you would use something similar to existing megastructures. The most populous metropolitan area in the world currently is Tokyo, Japan, with 37,833,000 people in an area of 5,200 square miles. This is approximately 7275.5769 people per square mile, which is a lot... unless you've got approximately 154 usable, habitable floors on the thing, which is a cozy 47 people per floor, per square mile. If you're going Coruscant-level construction, covering the entirety of landmass on Earth today (57,308,738 square miles), that will give you 4.169541303609522 Ã— 10^11 people... about 417 billion Average Joes. 

It depends on how much you want to flesh out the world economy that you're in. If it's in a "world not that much unlike our own", there's going to umpteen bazillion little pawn-style type shops... however, there's only going to be one or two that will frequently have incredibly rare or extraordinary items (IRL, those would be the Pawn Star's shop, or the Antiques Roadshow type thing). The average Artie's Artifacts will have normal things, with a single rare tome hidden in a stack of mundane ones, or a sword that is really powerful, but the shopkeeper only knows it as John Peter's (you know, the farmer) sword that was passed down from his grandfather. Like a normal pawn shop, the original owners can be coming back to retrieve their wares at any point, be they fantastic or mundane. You can have the surrounding area with nonstandard currency, any travelling marketeers that have carts full of wares may rely on bartering supplies and other things rather than trying to keep track of how much each currency requires. That allows them to have a good reason to have whole bunch of random things of various power levels on hand. You can have a shop that can move by itself. You can use the Dancing Hut of Baba Yaga as a reference, or Howl's Moving Castle, or "the Barn" from Haven, or the Witch's hut from Brave, Or the town of Brigadoon, the eponymous circus from The Night Circus novel or from the 4th season of Heroes... the list goes on. It doesn't matter if it moves on legs, wheels, tracks, a stiff eastbound breeze in the form of a mist, or simply vanishes at the speed of plot. It will plunk down outside of town, near a main road or crossroads. Perhaps they collect the wares from the passers by before moving along, as mentioned above, perhaps the crafters contained within don't realize that their wares are enchanted when the customers leave (because reasons!). 

Basically what I'm getting from the others answers is that its not possible, and I tend to agree. I don't think a tree could support it own weight that tall. However if we attack this problem from another angle... Your planet has these truly massive tall trees, just bumping up against the boundary of impossible. To get them even farther up high, they are on plateaus that are very high above sea level. Or maybe they're even really tall mountains. High rainfall would be required, but lets say your planet has that in those areas. Then, something happens to the planet where it's losing it atmosphere, so that brings the level down. What that is I admit I don't know, but maybe someone else can help you out with that part. Between all these things together that might bring you to just about the height you want. I would imagine, maybe, the part of the tree that sticks out of the atmosphere might die out, but everything that leads up to it could still be alive. 

The drug is incredibly hard to find in nature and every attempt to artificially manufacture it has failed. Why is it so hard to find? The fungus it comes from only lives for a certain time, in small patches, and then dies off. It takes so much energy from the soil that it basically kills of the surrounding area, and then itself. The area comes back to life over time, and the fungus comes back to life in other areas because its spores hibernate and awaken elsewhere. But it could be anywhere so there's no way to predict exactly where. When it does reappear there's a mad scramble to get as much of it as possible, and when it dies off the drug becomes a highly expensive commodity, making it quite rare. As for growing it in a controlled environment, well, attempts have been made, but the darned thing always dies off. Some agricultural scientists are starting to posit the view that the fungus itself may "know" when it's time to move on. Crazy, I know, but then again this is a sci-fi/fantasy story. 

Not really. There's a similar argument that cultures with different languages are better at math due to how their number-words are constructed. For example, in English, the number of 11 is called "eleven" and the number 15 is "fifteen", but in Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Turkish that number is basically called "10 & 1" or "10 & 5". That doesn't sound difficult but for early language learners, adding the extra baggage takes up time. Fifteen plus twelve has to be translated to 15 + 12 then 10+5 + 10+2 and then you get the answer, 27, which is then 20+7 or twenty seven. It's actually worse in other languages... for example, 99 is ninety nine in English, in Korean it's "9 10's & 9", but in French it's quatre-vingt-dix-neuf... which is literally "4 20s & 10 & 9". Because there's less 'lag' in Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Turkish, they've found that children in those cultures as a whole understand math faster, which propagated the original stereotype that the entire culture is just seemingly better at math than Western cultures. However, once those students get into more advanced mathematics including numbers in the abstract, all of that edge vanishes, so all cultures should be on the same level... however, there is a lingering psychological impact. Those who basically learned to hate math starting at those very early ages do even worse once math becomes abstract. Having a base 8, or octal, math isn't going to be structured all that differently in the grand scheme of things. Anything that goes down to base 2 will be effectively the same for any large computations. Now if we had 4 fingers on one hand and three or five fingers on the other... THAT would most likely have an impact. 

Try looking at $URL$ And Maybe this'll help too. Isaac Asimov offered a sci-fi way in his novel Foundations Edge. Here's a brief description: vendetta-online.com/x/msgboard/14/10163 

Well this is an event that has happened to EVERYONE all over the world, so people wont have a hard time accepting that bodies have been swapped. They'd only have to look at themselves as proof that it actually happened. However, you said the bodies swapped, but the minds should still be the same and the knowledge within. Lets take the President for example: He/she would still know things that only the President would know - codes, secret info, etc. Family members would still have memories that only they would know. I am convinced that if my lady friend told me a handful of things in this body swapped world I would totally know who she was based on those things. No matter where in the world she ended up she would still know my phone number, she would still call me up, and though she sounded different there are things that only she would be able to tell me about our private shared past. It would take a long time to get back to normal, and there would be a lot of trust issues along the way, but everyone has some knowledge that is still unique to them and a handful of others. This body swapped world sets up some interesting stories. What if a racist mans son turned up as a black guy? What if a murderer turned up as his victims loved one? What if the richest guy in the world turned up as the poorest most bed ridden guy who lost his job because of the rich guy? Good luck with your idea! 

It wouldn't. Basically, this new world is exactly like ours, but the barrels of oil are smaller and a different color. Gold became used as a currency for the sole reason that it was rare and there wasn't much use for it (other than being pretty). You have removed both of those things by turning it into the oil substitute. In Earth-1, price of oil is all over the map, due to the supply, availability, demand, locations it's held in, et cetera. In Earth-2, the same thing would apply to Gold. Because of that, it would never be used as currency, just like we would never want the U$D going up & down in value depending on how much the Saudis and Russians drill. You can have economies "Based on" gold in Earth-2, similar to how the Saudi, Russian and Venezuelan economies are "based on" oil, but there is no 1-to-1 correlation between a certain amount of the commodity and their paper currency. The closest thing to describe this concept in Earth-1 terms is actually aluminum and grain. Aluminum - When it was "invented", it was difficult to produce, and thus was quite expensive, surpassing even gold in value. In the late 1880s, there was discovered a way to produce it cheaply... and suddenly the value plummeted. It wasn't rare anymore, thus it wasn't expensive. Napoleon III of France had a set of special aluminum diningware that was made for those guests so honored that gold simply would not do... and today I'm drinking soda out of a aluminum can, and tossing it in the garbage. Grain - Before there were fiat currencies, everything was based on barter... but many things were hard to just carry around. Barley, Rice, or Grain Farmers would deposit their grain in a silo, get a series of receipts and then exchange them for goods & services, and the recipients of those receipts could exchange them again for grain. Being grain (or whatever it was), it does go bad over time, so the receipts were dated and could "go bad" and become worthless. These "Grain Dollars" were highly localized based on the location of the grain storage silos, and while they could potentially be traded further away, there was a risk for anyone receiving that currency that the amount of grain would be worthless if they waited to long to retrieve. Obviously, this system only works in a diversified economy - if everyone grew grain, that system would be useless, because everyone is just growing money. It was also nearly impossible to build coffers via taxes, because any particular amount can be used up, or go bad, at any point. In your idea, Gold would be like grain... a commodity. Anyone can mine it, it has intrinsic value, and whoever mined it faster/cheaper could make a quicker buck than everyone else. 

More than enough strength for even the toughest monster (you did mention they weren't Kaiju sized). So unless they can fly you should be ok. If any of them can fly... harpoon the suckers! 

I want to create a gas giant planet. The parameters I would like for it to have are: It should have a large layer of gas within its atmosphere that living creatures including humans can survive and thrive in, and I would like for that area to have zero-g. It should not be ridiculously windy. And it should include plant life and water. Iâ€™m assuming that such a gas giant would be within its solar systems Goldilocks Zone, but it doesnâ€™t have to be. Is this gas giant possible? 

This question assumes that there is complex, intelligent life on some other world other than the kind found on Earth. Carl Sagan allowed that silicon and germanium might replace carbon, and ammonia is thought to be the next thing that could be a conceivable replacement to water as a solvent. From wiki - Astrobiologist John Baross chaired a committee of scientists under the United States National Research Council that published a report on life's limiting conditions in 2007. The report addresses the concern that a space agency might conduct a well-resourced search for life on other worlds "and then fail to recognize it if it is encountered". I saw a science TV show that postulated that Silicon based life might present itself as a rock floating in space (hand wave the possibility). Say we had a method that we could use to recognize that floating space rock as a living being, how would we then interact share complex abstract concepts with it? Could life based on these other biochemistries interact with humans or would we be poisonous to one another? Could we share sciences? Would we even recognize one another? Or are the things that make us "alive" so different that we couldn't even interact? This question is probably too broad as written but I thought I'd roll the dice. EDIT: maybe the question suggests that I'm getting hung up on the "intelligence" part of the scenario. But actually not so much. No matter where we go in the universe the laws of physics will always be the laws of physics, 2 + 2 will always = 4, green will still be green no matter what we name it. On that basis alone we would have some way to start a dialog with another species no matter how alien. But what if that alien is ammonia based? Wouldn't its body literally be poisonous to us? What if there was an alien that was made of energy? What if there was an alien whose physicality was such that we couldn't even detect it with any of our five senses (a concept I'm toying with now)?
