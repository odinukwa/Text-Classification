Under this mundane interpretation, the term "necessarily" qualifies the implicit implication ("if...then"), not the attribution of properties ("is just and holy"). And Socrates refers always only to (ordinary) people, who are contingently just and holy, not to (magical) people who are necessarily just and holy... The mundane interpretation will sit well with what we already know about Plato, that he is used to emphasize the contrast between the perfect immaterial Forms and the imperfect material particulars. Just as no drawn circle is ever a perfect, mathematical circle, only an approximation, so no living person is expected to be perfect - ever - in Plato's view. 

As in: Even as a Clinton supporter, I completely agree that Trump is correct here. A fortiori (even more so), if I were (impartial) like you. Even for someone who doesn't care much for music, I adore the Beatles. A fortiori (even more so) if I cared for music (like you). 

The unity of the Real and the Ideal is what Hegel called the Idea. The Idea means, as for Kant, an ideal, infinite concept. But unlike Kant, for Hegel the Idea does get actualized in Reality. Hence the unity of Real and Ideal. This is what Hegel says in the Shorter Logic §214: 

In general, a fixed fixed point, like the one that Descartes believed he found, is not necessary. But provisional fixed points are necessary, in the questioning process. The questions themselves have pre-suppositions, so you cannot ask and doubt everything at the same time (that is, in fact, how Descartes arrived at his "fixed point"). But you can e.g. rely on A and question B, and later rely on B and question A. 

Kant's influence cannot be measured by the number of his specific theses which are considered correct today. What Kant discovered was a new concept, a new way of thinking, a new rationalist philosophical paradigm. And this paradigm was more suitable to the modern mind than its rationalist predecessors. In a characteristic methodical manner, Kant took the new paradigm deep and wide, leaving no philosophical stone unturned. With this he shook the philosophical world to the core. And so the philosophy after Kant is tangibly different from the philosophy before Kant. Kant famously said that David Hume's work woke him up from his slumber. Kant criticized Hume's empiricism on many issues, but he accepted, and further defended, the general thesis that knowledge cannot be had from beyond the bounds of possible sense experience. The combined attacks of Hume's empiricism and Kant's rationalism against the very possibility of transcendent knowledge was very effective. Since Kant and Hume, the possibility of transcendent knowledge is considered hopeless, and is therefore no longer taken seriously in mainstream philosophy. And this is the kind of historical influence that the Object Oriented Philosophers hope to overturn. 

Sraffa's gesture is said to have made a profound impression on Wittgenstein. Still, the details of this incident, and its interpretation, are in much dispute. Sraffa was not a philosopher, but an economist. He didn't publish anything on philosophy, or on Wittgenstein. The most plausible conclusion seems to me, that Sraffa influenced Wittgenstein by being for him a model of an intelligent person without philosophical training. Wittgenstein came to appreciate and to take into consideration Sraffa's raw pre-philosophical intuitions. Although there is no known direct link between Sraffa and any specific assertion or argument in Wittgenstein's texts. 

First, what is described in the question as Popper's solution, is not his solution, but his formulation of the problem. That is, the problem of induction. In essence, Popper fully accepted David Hume's presentation of the problem of induction. Yet Popper rejected Hume's psychological solution to the problem, and offered a solution of his own, involving the method of refutation. 

It could also be religious utilitarianism (and then, a new religious institution, not just a traditional one, may be seen as valuable to a non-believer): 

Third, Plato claimed that mathematics cannot - in principle - be thought purely in the abstract. Mathematical thinking necessarily requires concrete objects, images. These images he also calls the concrete "hypotheses" of mathematical thinking, hypotheses that mathematics cannot do without. But if mathematical thinking were based on abstract mathematical entities, why couldn't it be done, at least in principle, purely in the abstract? Hence, mathematical thinking is not based on abstract mathematical entities, according to Plato. it is rather based on abstract Forms plus concrete, material images. 

You have actually anticipated Descartes himself in this question. After he established his own existence, as a mind, a thinking being, with the Cogito (I think therefore I am) he proceeded to ask about the sources of the concepts ("ideas" in his terms) in his mind. 

This view of Wittgenstein's will provide us with an easy explanation to his rhinoceros assertion. For just as we cannot know, according to Hume and Wittgenstein, whether the sun will rise tomorrow, or not, we cannot know whether there was a rhinoceros on Russell's room, or not. When e.g. Russell looked under one table, it is perfectly possible (that is, logically possible) that the rhinoceros popped up under the other table, and vice versa. The rhinoceros could have been on the ceiling, it could have been very small, it could have been invisible, etc. There would be no way to know otherwise. And so the riddle may be solved. 

The claim that logical empiricism (= logical positivism) has "sterilized science" seems far fetched, even without getting into specific facts. The sciences have their own trajectories. Scientists are barely aware of what the philosophers are doing. Still, logical positivism was a popular philosophy between WWI and WWII, and it did apparently influence some scientists to some extent, in the direction of behaviorism and instrumentalism. And there has been some talk about impediments causes by scientists being, for a while, too impressed with the strictures of logical positivism. For example, here is what Nobel prize laureate physicist Steven Weinberg said in a 2015 interview on the history of physics: 

Kant's imperative commands us to treat the "humanity" (by which Kant meant rational morality) in a human being as an end, and not just as means. 

So it could seem that Wittgenstein was still attracted to a kind of idealism (indeed, to a kind of Schopenhauerian solipsism) at the time when he wrote the Tractatus. This version of solipsism is, naturally, not identical with Schopenhauer's own. Then again, Wittgenstein's mystical, silent solipsism is reminiscent of the strong hindu influences on Schopenhauer's thinking. Russell, in his introduction to the Tractatus, quotes Wittgenstein more or less verbatim on the subject of solipsism. He adds no observations of his own, except: 

Sartre did use the expression "existence precedes essence" as a motto, but his implied critical target was not Aristotle's general essence theory. It was, rather, the specific idea of human nature. Sartre's expression was meant to express the existentialist stand, that a human being's way in life is not chosen for him in advance, by his own nature or origin. That one has to choose one's way, and that one is free to do so. 

More or less, but see my comments above. The above formulations have no specific relation to Kant or to Quine. You might as well have said that all the western philosophers in the last 500 years are saying the same. 

Philosophical talk is "below natural science" when it attempts to refer to the structures of subjectivity, structures that underly the world (the world that language refers to), including the structures that make language possible. 

The divine right of kings when it is accepted by the people is indeed a powerful factor of stability, in Hobbes' sense. However, although Hobbes defended absolute sovereignity, he  decidedly did not recognize the divine right of kings. He argued that such a status existed only in the special circumstances of the biblical Jewish nation. There was no basis, Hobbes argued, for a similar status among Christians. Religious ministers ought to have no say in political matters. This is supposedly reflected also in Christ's own instruction to his followers to submit themselves to whoever is the prevailing ruler, even an infidel. 

I interpret it like this: philosophical talk is "above natural science" when it attempts to refer to things that are "too big" i.e. beyond the world, like God or the overall meaning of the world. 

What Russell meant by a "belief in nothing" seem to be this: Consider the belief that the sun is shining (at some time and place). If the belief is true, there is a corresponding something in the world (something that Russell called "a fact") that connects together "the sun" and "shining". It is the fact that the sun is shining. But if the belief that the sun is shining is (what we would ordinarily call) false, there is no corresponding fact in the world. If there is no corresponding entity in the world, a fact, then what do I believe in? How can a false belief have an object, when no corresponding object exist? Russell's suggestion was that, for a false belief has as object the ingredients of the intended fact, but not the fact itself. For example, if I believe that the sun is shining, and it isn't, then my belief has as objects the sun and (the universal property) shininess. The belief will have no fact as object, and to that extent it will be "a belief in nothing". Also, since the belief itself will be different when it is true than when it is false, the belief will not be "a single thing" as Russell puts it. How does all this help with the Liar paradox? My understanding is that it does that by eliminating the concept of a false (or mistaken) belief. It still doesn't seem to me to work, because it merely replaces the concept of false belief with that of empty belief ("a belief in nothing"). So you can replace, in the formulation of the paradox, each "mistaken belief" with "empty belief" and still you end in a similar paradox. In addition, even if this solution worked, the cost would be high. Because it warps the concept of belief in a strange and unnatural way. I suppose that Russell realized quite quickly the shortcomings of this attempted solution to the Liar. In Russell's later views, the problem of non-existing objects of beliefs was solved by the theory of descriptions. And the Liar paradox he attempted to solve through the logic of types.
