Why not both? You can read in your native language and consult a German text in key passages or even for random "flavor." Some schools teach quick, condensed grammar courses in German, without vocabulary or pronunciation, so you can work with the original using a dictionary. This let you observe key terms in their natural habitat. Many German terms (Auflklarung, Dasein)have a beauty and suggestiveness that is worth attending to. Many nouns click together and come apart like Legos, and it is helpful to play with the parts. And etymology is half of philosophy. Of course, language is endless, lifetimes are limited. 

I can say something without thinking it, just as I can think something without saying it. Therefore, I'd argue that "I think" is not implied in all language statements, but rather, "I say", "I state" or "I assert". From that perspective, the paradox resolves itself. 

I think tolerance is mostly a neutral thing. It can be used in good ways and it can be used in bad ways. Writer Iain McGilchrist alludes to the idea of a necessary distance in order for bonds to form. He compares it to reading. Too close, and you can't see anything. Too far, and you can't read it. I agree with Joseph here that in Western cultures the umbrella of tolerance is often used as an excuse to continue a sort of hypocritical, simultaneous, drawing near to and examining less of. We have let people into our necessary distance in order for bonds to form, but we have looked the other way. A shortcut has been taken. That is, if we had continued to examine the beliefs of others and drew them near at the same time, I believe, we could achieve a kind of love that we have for our family members who although we disagree with we still stick to. But because we are initially repulsed by the beliefs of others, things we do not know or understand, in the West we have drawn people near by looking away—and this intimate ignorance has brought on grave consequences because we cannot look away forever. Near things collide. Almost always. The longer two things are together, the higher chance there is that they will collide. I think what people desire when they cling onto ideals and slogans of tolerance and oneness are these bonds that form with necessary distance. They just got the order wrong. They did not want to take the step of self- and other-examination—because it's difficult and costly. What people say they want when they talk of tolerance, what I think they usually mean but are too afraid to ask for, is love. 

Laying aside for the moment this particular question, I really fail to understand your running commentary, or inquiry, on "dualism." I can't see that much hinges on it. We might even call it an obsolete term. Obviously, anything that can be "held in mind" or "communicated" is already mediated within a single substance, subject, monotheism, medium, whatever. In this sense, the only resort to any kind of "dualism" is the Kantian noumenal or Wittgenstein's "silence." Or the various allusions to the "other." It seems to me if philosophy has made any progress whatsoever, it could agree on this. Then your artificial foe, "dualism" becomes the complex issue of boundaries, thresholds, horizons, alterity, emergences, paradigm shifts, discontinuities, etc. Or, in evolution, say, Gould's "punctuated equilibrium." I really don't grasp this interest in "dualism." This seems to me a very minor leftover of the Cartesian development of skepticism. Can someone please explain to me why it has any relevance today? 

This has helped me solve many a perplexing problem in the past. There is Stackexchange itself, which is a cornucopia of useful thought provoking information all driven around the asking of questions. And lastly, there is the all time favorite of children everywhere: Why? 

There is a big jump from "is the absence of something" to "doesn't exist." I think most of the responses here, taken from the English stackexchange, were more focused on the language of it than the logic of it. For example, @chaos, 

Work is necessary to be happy because people have a fundamental need to create. Marx points out that modern systems of capitalism have divorced workers from the means of production and from reaping the benefits of their work. I think addressing this is a core problem of our present age. 

Your question was, What is the consensus about this argument..? As Conifold noted, it is not generally accepted today... as an argument. This is not a malign judgment about whether or not things exist. Or even whether "secure" knowledge exists. It is simply that his argument, as observed by Jo Wehler does not really have the sort of empirical component modernity expects and ends up based on intuition, God, and some circularity. And as Conifold said, it infers an "I" from thinking. Again, this is not a question of solipsism or radical skepticism. It is just that an ""I" has a lot of implications in it. Some might assume it entails a body. Or a certain type of continuity that stands apart from the body. Or a psychological ego with needs of of some sort. So the complaint is that this "secure foundation" is more like a rabbit out of a hat. A more judicious wording might go, "There is doubting, so there is some doubting substance." In a sense, Descartes was more or less "clearing the decks," and employing radical doubt to refute it. But you are mistaken to assume all the "great thinkers" simply accepted this particular argument. That is not the case for either Kant or Hume, for example, nor for most modern philosophers. What was crucial was Descartes' whole approach. To say that the "consensus" do not find it inarguably "secure" does not mean a wild leap into nihilism and epistemological anarchy. Indeed, many find Descartes too close to solipsism for comfort. He begins with a cellular autonomy that does not really account for other minds and requires great mental labors and a deity to arrive back at "things." 

Most philosophy begins with a question. I'm wondering why certain questions provoke more profound thoughts than others. What characteristics do good questions share with each other? How can we go about finding worthy problems to seek solving? For example, questions of ontology have led to much stimulating thought: What exists? How did it come to be? What does it mean to be? Questions about the nature of the universe have led to great advances in scientific thought: Does this phenomena happen every time? Under what conditions would this hold? Is this possible? Socratic questioning has brought us to the depths of the human soul, enabling us to examine the complex nature of the human mind and glean otherwise elusive truths: What makes you say that? Could you explain further? But what about...? In the perennial book How to Solve It, mathematician George Pólya, lays out a framework for solving problems by a series of progressively penetrating questions: 

In "Reference and Meaning" Putnam mentions, as an aside, that language requires a certain "division of linguistic labor" that has not been previously recognized. By this, as I take it, he simply means the modern social situation in which many words or concepts, such as the term "atom," cannot be analyzed by most people who use them. They depend upon a hierarchy in which the proper use of a growing number of commonly used terms implicitly depend upon agreements among experts, who can presumably supply reasonably consistent definitions if asked. As I say, this is merely a brief aside in this famous essay. Its implications would seem to be largely sociological. (My own interest is in the class structure of symbolic systems, more specifically in "money," and a multi-tiered use of ostensibly constant monetary terms and denominations within a shared money exchange system.) Is Putnam's idea here one that is well-known or has been developed elsewhere? Or are there similar concepts in philosophy, or in specifically linguistic-symbolic areas of sociology, that might prove fruitful in my amateur researches? Again, my general interest is in the formal structure of common terms that may function with double meanings based on "class hierarchy" within a single community of speakers. 

If you're looking for something a little easier to read, I've found Brian Greene's Fabric of the Cosmos to be a good balance of informative, entertaining, and understandable. 

I think you are asking two separate questions here. First, is it ethical to be proud of one's country? And second, can you be proud of something that you did not create? The first, as others have mentioned, is dependent on what you use to define your ethics. In most ethical systems, to have pride in (which is different from being possessed by hubris) is amoral. If a country is doing something which is ethical, then it is good to be pleased in that country. If a country is doing something unethical, then it is good to be ashamed of it. Most of the time a country, because it is made up of people, is like a person, and is in a much more complicated situation than merely being one or the other. The second is an entirely different question. You can be proud of things you do not create, but are a part of. I am a part of my family. I like being a part of my family, and am proud of them for their accomplishments. I may have influenced the way my family is, but I did not create my family. I was merely given the opportunity to be part of it. The same for a club, or a college, or a community. A country is just much larger, and you are a much smaller part of it. But you can still be proud of this collective identity if you so choose, and the ethics of that seem mostly irrelevant to most ethical systems. In general, however, I do not believe that most people who are proud of their country are applying the kinds of critical analysis that they would of other things. Because a country is such an abstract notion, and a person's idea of something can stray so far from the actual reality of it, I think many people end up with a harmful, blind, and unconditional approval of one's country despite all evidence to the contrary. Like recurring domestic violence between a husband and wife, where one or the other is unable to admit the fault or wrongdoing of the other. People tend to think it is wrong to apply value judgments to something they love, but that kind of detached, uncritical sense of loyalty actually turns out to do more harm than good. 

Cort Ammon has given a very good answer...and even better "fair warning." You question is perfectly okay, but so exceedingly broad that is can reach into nearly all corners of philosophy, from definitions of consciousness and "life" to the role of language and "representation." To answer it one would have to usefully limit the definition of "word" and of "thought," which entails a huge chunk of modern philosophy. Philosophers throughout the ages have attempted to define what distinguishes "animals" from "humans," usually settling on something called mind or soul or reason or language or symbolic systems, etc. For Descartes and his followers the line is quite distinct, and animals are far more like machines. Today, when we see machines simulating human "thinking" such boundaries blur. Moreover, research does show certain "language" skills in animals, so boundaries blur on the organic side as well. Your question might be framed in many ways, but I think of two that could avoid an endless quest into the nature of human consciousness. First, what are the limits of nonhuman organic reactivity and generalization or "animal consciousness"? Second, what are "words"? What is the difference between a human saying "there is an eagle" and a monkey warning cry indicating "eagle!" Do both involve representation? Is it a matter of degree? My own preferred framing is to look at all of these terms quite abstractly, as "communication." We can almost use this as a synonym for "society" or even "life." All lifeforms, even plants, must in some sense "communicate" between physical instantiations to continue and "re-present" themselves. This ghostly power of "communication" can be stored and transferred in various ways. All entail cells and membranes that must exclude some "communications" while remaining permeable to others. Human utterances appear to divide and redistribute experience in peculiar ways that slow and modify the physical continuum of "action" and "reaction" or "cause" and "effect." Animals do not appear to be so "loosely coupled." But at this point in my late-night answer I am reminded that words induct us into an infinite regress from which healthy animals appear to be exempt.
