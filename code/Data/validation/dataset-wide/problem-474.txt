SE Stout is a single speed mountain bike that runs relatively cheap. If you're confident in your ability to put it together properly, you can find them at bikesdirect for around 350. $URL$ It's got tabs for disc brakes so you could upgrade in the future, but comes with V-Brakes stock. I have a few friends who have these bikes and really like them. 

Some modern steel frames are ED coated, which inhibit rust on the inside and out. All-City does this with most of their frames, and Surly has started to do this with some new models as well (such as the ECR and straggler). Though in my experience the paint can chip a bit easier, but the ED coating below tends to remain intact. This may be an option if you want a durable steel bike at a cheaper price. You can always buy a can of FrameSaver and spray that inside the frame to protect it from rust as well. 

Go klunking all winter with coaster brakes, they shouldn't be affected by the weather. You can even use them in tandem with rim brakes. Whether you are going to want to use them in the conditions you ride in, that's a different story. 

My Rock N Roll Gold bike lube seems to get solid or gelatenous when stored on my unheated, but enclosed porch at colder temperatures. Is a chain lubricated with this product still going to be sufficiently lubricated when riding in freezing (below 0c or 32f) temperatures? Should I find a different cold weather alternative? 

Barefoot running shoes are too flexible for regular riding. They can be used in a pinch if you need to, but I wouldn't plan to use those on a tour or long ride. It's going to get very uncomfortable without the support from a rigid sole to help distribute the pressure from pedaling. SPD shoes are generally the best option for long rides. For touring where you are on and off the bike a lot, you may want to consider mountain bike style clipless shoes which allow you to walk around a bit easier than with road shoes due to a more recessed cleat. However, stiff soled sneakers (like adidas samba shoes and others) tend to be well suited to riding if you want to forgo the SPD option. Many people prefer to use sneakers along with toe clips or foot retention straps (FRS) to increase their pedaling efficiency. It's not as efficient as SPD shoes, but it's better than without clips or straps. 

Riding in the northeast US, I find myself encountering a lot of overgrown mountain bike trails in the spring. Many of these trails are bordered by briars / brambles / jaggers. I can't totally avoid them, so what can I do to protect my legs from them while not subjecting myself to overheating in hot weather with high humidity? 

Dual sided pedals are the worst of both worlds. They suck at being flats and suck at being SPDs, but they do both jobs. My preference is Shimano M324 SPD Pedals. They fit all my different cycling shoes without any problem. They have a flat side and a SPD side, each side has a separate job. You'll find yourself flipping them with your toes frequently whether you wear regular shoes or clipless shoes. I keep them on my commuter because I like to have the option to ride whatever shoes I happen to be wearing. If you try it and hate it, you're pretty much going to want to get two sets of pedals and swap them when you want to wear different shoes. As for shoes, pretty much any MTB shoe will do so long as you're using SPD cleats, but the market has been leaning more towards walkable lately. Do not get something super stiff with carbon footbed, that's the opposite of what you want. You want a little flex if you're actually walking. My cheap goto is a giro carbide, they are under 90 bucks and are pretty walkable. Giro Terraduro shoes are pretty sweet if you're doing a lot more walking on or off road. If you want more casual, get some Chrome or DZR shoes. I've run both and they might crunch a little bit at first, the cleates sharp edges wear down a bit and feel pretty good for all day wear when walking or riding. You can't get dual sided pedals in any cleat style except shimano SPD, so you better be intersted in buying in to that system. But, it's pretty reliable. I treat my gear like crap and none of my shimano pedals have failed, they may have rusted a bit, but they still do their job. 

Cyclocross bikes will have a slightly different geometry. More like a relaxed road geometry with a higher bottom bracket than a road bike typically. You'll be stretched out a bit less and more upright. Cross frames also will have wider tire clearances for 32mm to 35mm tires, but it varies by model as some can fit 38mm to 45mm tires. Traditionally, brakes tend to be wide profile cantilever brakes for good tire clearance and less chance of clogging with mud on cyclocross bikes. However, disc brakes are now readily available on many cyclocross bikes. Road / Racing bikes tend to use caliper brakes which have better modulation, but typically have small tire clearances, which may be too restrictive for cross tires, especially when they are covered in mud. The new standard rear wheel size for disc cross bikes seems to be 135mm, so it's the same as mountain bike disc hubs. Non disc cyclocross bikes tend to have rear hubs which are spaced at 130mm, the current road standard hub spacing. Tires on a cross bike are going to be different as well. Road bikes will typically have skinny 23mm to 28mm slicks. On a cyclocross bike, you will typically have knobbier tires which may not last as long and provide more rolling resistance when compared to road tires, which is a tradeoff for having better handling on dirt / grass / mud. You can always swap out tires to match whatever style of riding you prefer. Depending on how serious you are about racing, you can find both cyclocross and road tires available as glue on tubular tires. However, some people have been adapting mountain bike tubeless technology and mounting cross tires as tubeless to run lower pressures for better offroad handling. It is not common to use the mountain bike style tubeless setup on a road bike, and generally not desirable. Road bikes and cyclocross bikes tend to use STI shifters and similar groupsets (chainrings / cassette / derailleur combinations), however sometimes people prefer to use bar-end shifters for cyclocross (or retroshift shifters which mount bar end shifters on brake levers). Additionally, some cyclocross bikes have an extra guard on the outer chainring to prevent injury when mounting / dismounting frequently. These guards are typically not as heavy duty as mountain bike bash guards. Cable routing tends to be different on cyclocross bikes due to the need to shoulder a bike during the race, so under the top tube routing is typically avoided. Sometimes 3 cables on top of the top tube or internal cable routing strategies are used. Often times full housing will be used to help prevent cables from getting contaminated with mud as easily. 

Try putting the tire in water with a bit of dish soap. The soap will make the bubbles a bit more apparent. Adding a bit more pressure and trying to articulate the area around the valve may help identify the source of the leak. Keep an eye out for tiny air bubbles forming on the surface of the tube while you hold it under water. Also, be careful to check around existing patches. After checking the tube thoroughly, check the inside of the rim for any sharp ridges or places where the rim tape maybe has been worn too much and may let a sharp edge protrude under pressure. Then check the tire itself for any items which may be lodged in it. Glass and metal shards can hide within the rubber of the tire, and when under load or pressure, the fragment can puncture your tube. They may not always be visibly apparent. Slowly feel around the inner surfaces of your tire (lining up the label on the tire with the valve stem can help you identify where to look if you find a hole in the tube). Sometimes I try and work slowly around the tire and bend the tire so that any gaps in the inside of the tire would open slightly and expose the fragment. 

DriKase and Drikase XL (for large phones or phones with cases) are good waterproof phone cases which mount to your stem and keep your phone dry while being able to operate it through the liner. It doesn't set it out front of your bars though. 

Can I use indexed 10-speed microshift bar end shifters (on retroshift levers) with 9-speed deore lx rear derailleur and 10-speed 11-36 cassette? If not, What rear derailleur would work with the microshift shifters in indexed mode with this cassette? 

I need spacers, as noted by AlexCuse. It looks like the spec I was looking for was 'chainline' in the case of my crank, which is measured from the centerline of the frame to the middle ring in my case (this varies by crank type). I can probably estimate at the number of spacers by taking the bb shell size divided by 2, add the width of one BB cup that sits outside the shell and add the spacer size to get the resulting chain line. That would be (68mm "bb shell" / 2) + 10mm "bb cups" + X "spacer size for one side" = 49 "quoted chainline for my crankset". So, I'd say it was 34 + 10 + x = 49, solving gives x = 5. So, I would assume I'd need 1x 5mm spacer on each side, give or take. (I'm estimating the bb cup size, everything else is quoted from the manufacturers specs). See sheldon brown's notes on chainline: $URL$ Park tool chainline guide: $URL$ 

The east coast is supposed to have a really bad year for ticks with Lyme disease as well as the concern about Zika Virus and West Nile Virus. I know DEET is effective at both keeping bugs off and melting technical gear. I'm worried that repeated use of DEET will destroy my nice Goretex jacket, my expensive bib shorts, my softshell trousers, synthetic jerseys, and technical overshorts. What's the best option for repelling mosquitoes and ticks for mountain bikers riding in the woods that won't harm my technical gear? See Example: $URL$ $URL$ 

A scientific Journal, Chest Journal, published an article about the efficiency of heat exchange masks on asthmatic subjects during cold weather exercise. They found that the heat exchanger masks were at least as effective as pre-treatment with albuterol in preventing decline in lung function. I found several commercial heat exchange masks which could potentially be used for cycling: Airtrim AirTrim Heat/Moisture Exchange Masks - seems to be the most athlete focused product and would likely be effective. N-Ferno 6970 Extreme Balaclava with Hot Rox Polarwrap, The Exchanger Mask Talus Outdoor Technologies ColdAvenger Pro Soft Shell Mask or ColdAvenger Expedition Balaclava AirGuard Medical CT Mask for COPD or Asthma - May not be designed for high levels of activity However, for less extreme temperatures, simply breathing through some medium, like fleece, which captures the moisture you exhale and passes inhaled air back over it may work as a less efficient, but still potentially effective heat exchange in warmer temps. For me, breathing through the balaclava helps a bit in temps over 15F, but is less effective at lower temps. Anti-Pollution masks may provide a similar effect as well, but may not capture as much heat if they use exhalation valves which remove some of the exhaled air without capturing the heat. 

Can I run a SRAM road (apex/rival/force/red) rear derailleur with downtube shifters? I though you might be able to mount the bar-end shifters on downtube, but it seems like they are a ratcheting type as opposed to the usual downtube shifter design. I've also heard that shimano shifters will probably not pull enough cable in friction mode to accommodate the entire cassette. Is there any way to do this properly? 

You should always have a multi-tool. There are few cases where I really need separate Allen keys on the road. However, I tend to keep a long 5mm Allen key for tightening Drop bar lever clamps, which can't be accessed easily by a stubby multi tool. Ball ends can help when you can't got a straight shot at a bolt and have to try to mate the wrench at a gentle angle, it has more chance of stripping your bolt though. I find that separate keys can give you better torque, but I find that more useful for removing stuck bolts (or overtightened seatpost clamps) than tightening. I also recommend carrying a multi-tool that has a chain tool on it. When you need it, it's a godsend. If you're running a 9 or 10 speed bike, a spare quicklink is very good to have. Additionally, depending on the bike, I like to carry a separate small crescent wrench with a 15mm capacity for track nuts, cantilever cable hanger yolks, and rack or brake nuts. 

Will an 1/8" chain and cogs wear slower than 3/32" chain and cogs for single speed / fixed gear setup? What about using an 1/8' chain mismatched on 3/32" chainring and cogs? 

Puncture resistant tires and liners are hard to DIY since they are made from kevlar and other specialty materials which are not easy to come by on the consumer market. Flat protection opions: Puncture resistant tires $35 to $80 a tire - most expensive, best protection, only good for the life of the tire. My favorite lightweight ones are panaracer t-serve, most protection panaracer ribmo. Tire Liners - $15-$25 a set- cheaper, reusable when you get new tires, adds a bit to rotating weight. Mr Tuffy and Slime brands are available. I haven't used these personally. Tubes with sealant - $10-$15 per tire - will seal small punctures with a liquid sealant. This is pretty much the same liquid in tubeless tire setups. This can have mixed results. Slime can get messy and clog valves. I don't think these are worth it. Really, none of these will prevent pinch flats either. Your best bet is to use one of the first two options and keep tires inflated to the proper PSI regularly. Always carry a patch kit and tools to fix a flat and a spare tube is nice to have as well, it pays to be prepared. 

Visors seem pretty ubiquitous on mountain bike helmets, but not on road bike helmets. Why do mountain bike helmets have visors? What purpose does the visor have? 

You could try something with slightly less coverage like the sks raceblades. However, the sks commuter fenders have less clearance in the back. It still might be too much though. Clip on fenders like the portland design work soda pop fenders may be an option for you as well, but they provide less coverage overall. Fenders are one of those things that are pretty easy to hack yourself if you have some small tools. I trim off some material from the fender to make it fit. I would bolt it on to the fender mounts on your rear dropouts and then measure the distance from the actual end of the fender to where you would like the fender to end. Then, on the other side of the fender, where you secure it near the cranks, I would mark the fender and trim that much material off from the end. You could do this with a coping saw or a dremel tool pretty easily on plastic fenders. You'll need to re-drill a mounting hole. You might not be able to trim the fender in a straight line, you may have to cut it in a similar pattern to the bottom of the existing fender, depending on the fender's width. Skinny fenders may need little to no tapering at the bottom, while large fenders may need to be thinned down a lot. Really, just make it look like the end you're chopping off and it should be fine. You could trace the shape on to some paper, cut it out, and trace that on the fender before making your cuts. You might also want to put some washers on either side of the new hole for extra reinforcement. 

I broke the rear derailleur on my surly karate monkey recently. I had the bike setup 2x9. I decided to try and get home by converting to single speed via trail side repair (made easier by the horizontal dropouts on the bike). I put the chain on the big chainring in the front, figuring the front derailleur would hold it in place. I pulled the chain out of the derailleur, shortened the chain so it would not be routed through the derailleur, and I tried to find the straightest line in the rear, and selected the 20t cog to place the chain on, this was the 4th cog in from the end of the cassette. I pulled the rear wheel backwards to tension the chain as much as possible. I had already been using a chain tensioner (surly tuggnut) to keep it stationary, so I screwed that down to keep the rear wheel from slipping under pedaling. However, after a short time, the chain started to upshift on the cassette. It went up a cog and jammed, shifting the non-driveside forward, pushing my tire in to my chainstays. this was difficult to fix, because I had to remove the tuggnut and undo my very tight quick release. What's the best practice for positioning the chain in the rear to avoid auto shifting and jamming like I'm experiencing?
