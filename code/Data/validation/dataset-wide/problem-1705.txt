I have a pool of virtual machines running in ESX that have their virtual hard drives set to Indenpendant/Non-Persistent mode. I won't go into the reasons for this other than to say it is working really well for us. Periodically I need to reset these settings back to the standard persistent mode and would like to automate that via a scheduled task for script. Does anyone know how to do this? 

I'm setting up a new Search Center for our Intranet using MOSS and want to make heavy use of of Keywords and Best Bets. However two questions about this have me perplexed and I would appreciate any help/guidance? 1) If you assign a contact to a keyword/best-bet and set a review date, my understanding is that SharePoint will automatically send that contact an email alert when that time comes. However in my testing just using my account as the contact I have never received one of these. Am I doing something wrong? 2) What permissions would a user need to edit/update a keyword they are the assigned contact for? I assume too that if they have the rights to update one of them then they can probably unfortuantely update them all, correct? 

I have a SharePoint 2007 farm (w/ SP2, June cumulative update) hosting an Internet site and am seeing the nightly content deployment incremental job that moves content from our staging environment to production fail with the error below. When this happens the only way we know to resolve it is to manually run a full deployment. However the issue seems to come back again in a few days. Any advice on how to isolate the root cause of this problem and correct it?

I want to invoke some .NET webservices from a classic asp app on 64-bit win2k3 server. The classic code is its own site with SSL set up. Where do I put the .NET code? Do I make a virtual dir off the Classic site? 

Our admin put a 12gb C: partition on the 64-bit Windows 2003 server that hosts my asp.net and classic asp apps. Is that sufficient? What can I safely move off to an external disk (service pack files, etc?) 

I've got an SMTP server running on IIS Windows Server 2003 that sends mail out via another relay - sometimes that mail doesn't arrive. Where can I find out why mail isn't sent past the relay? 

I'm pricing SANs and the cheapest I can find are 36k; we're limited in our department to 25k in purchases before they go for approval. I'd love to get rid of tape backup, as they are cumbersome and unreliable. Can a SAN be had in the 20k range? 

I'm a developer who inherited a Win2k3 box in a small shop with a database server (SQL Server). What kinds of things do I need to know to monitor the server and see what processes cause the most problems/use the most system resources? Is there a handy utility that will help? 

I run into this error every time I try to update (CentOS 6) on four different servers. It only happens with this package. After researching the problem, I haven't been able to find any useful info. People have had very similar problems to this, but not this particular one. Can anyone offer me any advice on how to fix this issue? 

Some of my users are using Gmail to send mail to our domain (The mail server for which is hosted on a CentOS 5 machine with postfix). Sometimes, but not all the time, when they do, they get a bounceback similar to: 

I'm running CentOS 6.3 x64 on a Dell PowerEdge R520. I have run the following two commands as per This Wiki 

parameter to my /etc/postfix/main.cf file, then added some regex to the bogus_commands file to try and replace any command beginning with 

Can anyone help me find the proper syntax for the regex that I need for this to work? I'm not a regex expert by any means. I'm probably just doing something simple wrong. Any help you can provide is most appreciated. 

And it has yielded that I am, as I suspected, missing the dependencies that I accidentally removed. But, I'm not quite sure how to install all the missing dependencies (as there are quite a few, I would like to install them all at once.) and restore VirtualBox to its original state. Can anyone offer some advice? I have tried just a yum install of VirtualBox 4.2, but to no avail. Thanks 

I have a server with three sites on it (the default site and two applications). I want to set up some test sites (classic ASP) on the server but if I put them under Default Web Site I can't set them as the root for their own applications. In other words, my application uses non-relative paths and I want to be able to test the thing without redoing how I do my includes all over the app. What are my options? I thought about setting up Host Headers but I don't have access to any name resolution for the server- that's handled by someone else. 

I"ve got a client who currently has a site that's not SSL who wants to print materials with a URL on them. However, we're going to SSL in the next couple of months and I want to make sure that the URL we publish will seamlessly redirect if we have to. I'm running ASP Classic (and some .NET) on Windows Server 2003 64-bit running in 32-bit mode. Advice? Thanks! 

I have IIS running two sites + IIS virtual folders (w3root) on a win 2k3 server. I wondered if there were any way to also piggyback FTP traffic on that pipe by using port 80 on the ftp server. How would I do this and still keep the web stuff running without interruption?
