Basically, the first 5 minutes are critical for a very profound reason: The person whom you are reaching out to is actively thinking about your product or service. Wait 10 minutes, and that person may move onto other things. Call later, and you're likely to interrupt. Apply Lead Response to Read Receipts So, how exactly does that apply to read-receipts, you ask? Well, we might not be trying to sell something, but the psychology is still the same. When you as the sender get that read receipt confirmation from the email you sent to Bob, you know that Bob is now actively thinking about whatever it is that you sent him. Pick up the phone and call him, and you're less likely to interrupt. Instead, you're more likely to catch Bob in the mode to discuss whatever problems you both are trying to solve. Using read-receipt in this manner can lead to much more productive interactions, as well as the same "wow" effect that sales teams experience when they call a potential customer while that person is actively thinking about the problem they're trying to solve. Thus, if you get emails requesting read-receipt, stop thinking that they're out to get you. This person just may be trying to do a better job at managing his or her communications. If you are a person who uses read receipts in this manner, be sure to communicate why you are requesting read receipts as this will help curb any misunderstandings. 

Mandatory Time Away is typically used in the financial industry or industries where there's a high chance that employees in a position of responsibility could commit fraud or steal from the company and manipulate the numbers in order to hide the theft. This is especially common in the banking industry. The idea is that if there's some fraudulent activity occurring, sending away the manager or accountant for two weeks and having someone else fill in would likely uncover any discrepancies, since the offending party wouldn't be around to continue manipulating the data during the period while he/she is away. There's at least one claim here, from an alleged bank employee, that the IT department of the bank locks employees out of all systems when they are on their mandatory time away period. See this Banker's Online forum thread for more details. A better source is Section 4-2 of the FDIC Regulations and Safety Manual, which states the following about vacations in the banking industry: 

This is actually a good argument for making sure developers are on salary. A salaried individual is paid based on results, not by hours worked. Therefore, as long as you're getting your work done and meeting your goals, the finer micro-details, such as how long your break is and what you choose to do with that break time, should really be no one's business but yours. This is of course just my expert opinion, but that opinion is based on observations and experiences working in environments where management stays out of your way. Of course, different workplaces will look at this differently. It's your responsibility when looking for a job to properly evaluate your employer, and you can sometimes do this just by observing the way people behave in the office. You can also tell a lot about the design of the office. Is it a bland cube farm? Or do they have foosball tables, ping pong tables, and other amenities that seem to suggest it would be okay to get up and move around? On one particular instance where I looked for a job, I actually called the customer service line, mentioned I was applying, and asked the representative a few questions about how he/she liked working at the company. The responses helped give me a perspective from a non-manager as to what I was getting myself into. Consider that any business worth working for will probably want their employees to stay healthy, and considering the heath hazards of sitting at a desk all day, some will likely encourage you to get up and move around. If it's not already clear, I strongly suggest staying away from organizations that would have a problem with you getting up and walking around. It's their decision to decide how they want to manage their staff, and it's your decision to look for better employment if one particular employer has a restrictive management style. 

You interacted with a coworker, who just also happened to be your boss, outside of the workplace in an environment, a bowling alley, in an establishment that serves alcohol and has rules that differ significantly from the professional workplace. The rules of the workplace just plain don't apply in this setting. In other words, this just doesn't seem like an HR issue that is "actionable". Your boss sounds.... interesting.... and he definitely acted a bit inappropriately, at least as far as you and your wife are concerned. Maybe your boss and his wife are a pair of swingers and this is just how they behave. It's quite possible that your boss and his wife are more... open... physically than you and your wife. Also, alcohol was involved, which tends to lower inhibitions and make people forget what they're doing. If you talk to HR, don't expect action. If you go in expecting HR to talk to him, then you're just going to create bigger problems. However, conversations with HR are supposed to be confidential; therefore, you could explain the situation to HR as a way to get some "official" advice on how you can proceed in getting along with your boss, without losing your job, and without causing the company hardship. For instance, depending on your corporate culture, you may be able to actually pull your boss aside and have a one on one conversation, being frank about the fact that you don't appreciate the behavior and don't want to see that happen again. As long as you're respectful towards your boss and talk in private, you may be able to work this out. Your goal in talking to HR should be merely to get your issues documented, and announce your plan to discuss this issue privately with your boss. Having this documented by HR is merely a way to protect yourself in case relations with your boss decline due to his continued inappropriate behavior. With that said, he can't take back what he did, but you have to work with this guy, so it's really up to you to get closure on this issue, clear the air, and move on. Once you move on, don't ever bring the issue up again, and don't discuss it with anyone else at work other than HR. If you make your boss's life hard because of this, it will make your life hard too. Lastly, this is a good argument for not spending time with coworkers outside of work. When the lines blur between personal and professional, things can get quite messy. Good luck! 

Giving gifts to supervisors and managers is always a grey area; however, in this case, the equipment was obtained free of cost to the employee, as part of the fees paid by the employer to send said employee to the conference. Thus, in this case, giving the device away to another colleague, including a manager, is less suspect than it would be if that employee went out of her way to obtain a gift for the manager. This sounds like a simple case of obtaining property through work, not having a need for it, and then giving it to the manager to do with it as he pleases. I don't see this as gift giving so much as redistributing property that the company essentially paid for by proxy. Even in my place of employment, it wouldn't be uncommon for people to redistribute items that they obtained that they don't need, and it never seems awkward to us. As far as what you should do, say nothing. Don't make a big deal out of it, and most likely, others won't make an issue out of it either. Who knows, next time the boss goes to a conference and gets free stuff he doesn't need, he may give it to you or another colleague who could use it. By making an issue out of this, you may force your place of work to come up with a policy that may not be in your best interests. 

When your stress levels are too high, sometimes it's best to take a break and give yourself time to recover. If you don't reduce your stress, this could seriously impact your health, and it could seriously, and negatively, impact your job, which will only cause further stress. It's important that you do things to reduce your stress now before it becomes too much to deal with. Hope this helps! Good luck! DISCLAIMER: I want to emphasize that, although managing stress in the workplace is a skill that many of us learn to master, in this case, because of the nature of the issues you're facing, you may want to seek professional help. When it comes to Psychology, I am not an expert and cannot legally provide counseling. 

If the volunteer work that you did for the open source project relates to the work you are applying for, by all means, include it. Just make sure you are crystal clear that it was a volunteer position. Having volunteer work on your resume between employment gaps demonstrates that you are the type of person who uses her time wisely, and an employer will (or should) appreciate your demonstrated desire to continue to learn new things and keep your skills up to date. My suggestion is to include it in a section titled "Employment/Volunteer Work" so that you can show a chronological breakdown of where this fits in. When I applied for my first job, I was volunteering at a local FreeGeek. I listed this on my resume to show the time that elapsed between graduating from college and applying for the job. I received an offer 4 days after my interview. By the way, I'd leave out hobbies. If it doesn't apply to the position, don't put it on the resume. Think about the last time you had a pile of paperwork to go through, or something that involved finding a needle in a haystack. You are the needle, so make sure the recruiter only sees relevant information. Good luck! I just read your bio, and you are freaking awesome! I especially enjoyed reading about the Twister game you made as a kid. I'm not sure you can put that on the resume, but it's a cool story ;) 

One advantage that you do have is in the regularity in which you hold these sorts of events. With the events happening once every two months, it's quite possible for you to build up a list of previously effective volunteers. When it comes time to recruit volunteers for the next event, start with the people who have experience working with you and who have done a good job. Consider incentives that may help encourage these people to continue to participate:
