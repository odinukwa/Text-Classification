I have been reading a little bit about the problem of consuming meat ethically. As much as I find the ethical argument compelling I have some reservations regarding the inconsistency with which it is often applied. Imagine we decide all to go vegan, and soon enough a new scientific consensus is reached that plants can also experience pain. What do we do then? In this scenario, consuming plants would be incompatible with the principle of trying to avoid unnecessary suffering given our current agricultural practices. So the ethical argument for stopping meat consumption seems to me an example of sentiocentrism. Do we need to reframe the debate to include non-sentient beings? Perhaps focus on the stability of the ecosystem? 

So far I have to say that the argument to reduce suffering is the one that resonates the most with me. I personally have no problem eating meat per-se, it is the mistreatment of animals that bothers me. I have not heard a convincing argument for making sentient beings the center of moral concern but maybe it's just my lack of understanding. What I see is that nature is full of examples in which different species feed from each other in a way that's mostly stable and conserves the ecosystem. In the case of meat consumption -- and more generally agriculture -- it's pretty clear that the ecosystem is actually being destroyed which is another very good reason to find a solution where we can preserve the ecosystem. I don't think this implies the absolute need to stop consuming meat. I believe that the idea of plants being able to have experiences is not a far fetched idea since I have seen the progression of the sciences telling us very unintuitive things like: plants have parts that exhibit synaptic-like behavior, plants communicate, plants have a notion similar to that of the self. All of this is expected and predicted by the theory of evolution, namely that we would find many of the features from one species in other species at different stages of development depending on how relevant such feature is to its fitness. I think seeing all organisms as information processing systems reveals the idea that what we call "response to negative stimuli" when talking about plants is nothing more than what we call "the ability to experience pain" in other species. Of course this is not yet a scientific consensus but it looks like it's going in that direction. The fact that all living organisms we know about share a common ancestor makes them equally deserving for the right to exist, thrive and evolve. This is of course independent from us recognizing them as sentient beings. Related links: 

If it is objective evidence it certainly points toward ~P without objectively proving it - but providing a clue for further inductive investigation. After that, more evidence might be found. Incomplete evidence can still be key to evidence. 

Obviously you are making assumptions from a small amount of information and know it. You need to read her original material, but no its not a blending, it is a unique philosophy. Nietchze still believed in sacrafice in reverse, sacrificing others to yourself. Ayn Rand in brief: Every value has to be produced. If you are not producing values, you are not rationally selfish. Therefore a thief is not selfish and a beggar is not selfish. Goods come from working. It doesn't support violating rights. It is influenced by the American founding fathers whom didn't express such a philosophy explicity. In Ayn Rand's opinion America failed because of this, because it didn't have its own philosophy and instead fell under the influence of European philosophy. Individual rights were forgotten, and the Constitution continually misunderstood. 

Numbers on their own represent nothing, one always represents an entity, two and beyond are all groups of entities. It is a matter what entity the number represents. If that entity is for example millimeters then it is an objective unit of measurement, if that unit is some arbitrary mental unit it relates to nothing and the sum is nonsense. 

I want to learn logic better, I know a few fallacies but I've read no books mostly just stuff on the Internet. I see them everywhere, but sometimes I don't know what the fallacy is called. I am a pretty decent logician, but I want to learn the terminology well. Where do I start? What books do you recommend? 

I remember from The blank slate by Steven Pinker that there is such a term for the belief/view that humans can be improved, I believe it's called Human Improvability and it had something to do with whether or not "nature" is fixed or not. I would like to know if there's a technical term that I can use to look up some bibliography and learn more about it. End of the question What follows is just context on how I got here, if the community feels it's not relevant to the question I will remove it. The notion of changing the world has a similar flavor as the one about improving oneself, except that they refer not an individual but to a system external. In any case, I believe the reason it bothers me not because I disagree with it but because I don't really have a strong logical argument to defend it. In part it's also due to agreeing with Nassim Taleb when he argues against interventionism in his book Anti-fragile. Taleb says something like, trying to intervene to improve the state of any complex/big system will most likely result in making it worse and he explains how he uses hokus pokus --convexity analysis or something-- to evaluate whether a given system is more likely to benefit or suffer from intervention. I don't think I can evaluate the validity of Taleb's claims but I have to admit that he started me thinking about non-intervention a lot. Of course there are plenty examples where intervention was very successful, e.g., vaccination, same for the other case. 

On a temporary basis and as an ongoing personal philosophy selflessness is possible but a consistent selfless life is unsustainable. Selflessness perhaps seen "Universally" or collectively could be seen as good because collectivism inherently blanks-out the individual, but in an individual sense selflessness is bad. All values have to be produced by individuals, so altruism requires a sacrifice of time and effort. To see morality in regards to the daily and your long term goals, as individuals, sacrifice is bad. I do consider benevolence and altruism to be separate concepts. Philosophy qua individualism selflessness is bad. It can mean a few things: material selflessness (the giving of possessions), spiritual selflessness (giving up logic and thought; ie religion), and collectivist ethical doctrine towards the state. 

The first form of language is concept-formation from perceptions, the second is concept-exchange verbally. He cannot teach them, because they cannot understand his concepts as they have not formed them perceptually and consciously like he has. To quote my second favorite philosopher, Leonard Peikoff: 

To consider this objectively one must keep in mind when seeing the result of votes, on how they are created. Rationally one must consider that the votes on this site came from its rules, that is, because of them to get votes you have to get reputation and objectively it is just reputation. The system provides an objective valuation as far as the members are being objective. If the majority of the site are objective, the numbers are objective within their own definitions based on their causes: the rules.
