Of course the above refer to the unmarked neutral order without any focusing, topicalization, or contrast. This typology does not seem to extend to other phrase types like purpose/reason. Unfortunately it does not seem to be cataloged in WALS but it is found in Unilang. 

If we overlook the word "solely" in your question for now, then yes this does occur. Kamil's example from Polish is on point: 'woman' nom. sg. 'oh woman!' voc. sg. 'with a woman' instr. sg. 'to the women' dative pl. Where between the vocative and instrumental the only difference is the nasality of the final vowel. This is a regular alternation in Polish. Of course, Polish also uses non-nasal distinctions for inflections (e.g. vs. ); and nasality is used for lexical distinctions as well (e.g. vs. ).

I will look specifically at the western Classical origins of these terms. The Ancient Greeks in particular had extensive mythology and naming associated with all the Winds (Ἄνεμοι Anemoi) and directions, not just the cardinals. The Greeks were a seafaring people and wind direction was central to their lives. North L septentriō (adj. septentriōnalis) = septem "seven" + triō, that is "the seven plough-oxen (stars of Ursa Major). triō (pl. triōnes) is problematic. Most sources give this as meaning "plough-oxen", but this term for plough-oxen is used nowhere else in Latin. A few sources posit that triō < PIE *(s)tē̆r- "star" with loss of initial s as in Indic, and that later mythology led people to reinterpret the root as "oxen". The transparent meaning of this word to the Romans was "in the direction of the constellation the Plough (Ursa Major)". L boreās (adj. boreālis) was also used to mean "north" or "North Wind" and was a direct borrowing from Greek Βορέας. The Romans also called this Wind Aquilō; this latter word is of unsure etymology. There have been attempts to relate it to aquila "eagle", aquilus "dark" and aqua "water", viz. "rainy wind". Gk Βορέας boreas "north, the North Wind" was a Greek word also of unsure etymology. It has cognates in other Balkan and Slavic languages such as Alb borë "snow", Srb бура "cold north wind". It is often said to come < PIE *gʷor- "mountain". This very likely is a reference to a North wind, cold and perhaps arising from mountains, that was prominent in these people's original homeland. South L merīdiēs (adj. merīdiōnālis) meant "noon, midday" < medius “middle” + diēs “day”. Since the sun is in the South at midday in the Northern hemisphere, this word is self-explanatory. L auster (adj. austrālis) was the Latin name of the South Wind and the South. Now here is a fascinating bit of history and its relation to language change. Most scholars believe that auster < PIE *-aus "shine" - which is the same root that gives rise to the words for "dawn" and "east" in other IE languages! How can the same root be used for different cardinal directions in sister languages? One theory is that since the Italian peninsula runs diagonally NW-SE, the word for "east" shifted to mean "south" since both were in the direction of the Tyrrhenian Sea. Another theory is that since the lands to the South were burning hot, or alternatively since the sirocco was hot, the root *aus- referred to this heat. Gk νότος notos was the South wind of the Greeks. I have no idea what its etymology is. East L oriēns (adj. orientālis) was the usual Latin term. The meaning was transparent in Latin: "rising", viz. "in the direction of the rising sun". oriēns is the present participle of the deponent orior, "rise" < PIE *or- O-grade of "move" Gk ἠώς eos was used in Greek and also meant "dawn", which is cognate with Latin aurora and Germanic east. ἠώς < PIE *h₂ewsṓs/*h₂ausōs < *aus- "shine". This is conjectured to be a reference to the shining dawn; but see 'south'. West L occidēns (adj. occidentālis) was the usual Latin term. The meaning was similarly transparent in Latin: "going down/setting", viz. "in the direction of the setting sun". occidēns is the present participle of occidō, "fall/go down" < ob “towards/facing” + cadō "fall” < Proto-Indo-European *ḱad- “fall”. L vesper "evening" was also used to mean "west" in reference to the setting sun. Gk ἕσπερος hesperos was found in Greek, cognate to Latin vesper and Germanic west. ἕσπερος < PIE *wesperos/wekeros "evening" < *wes "wind, blow" + *pero "source". In origin this may have been something like "the direction from which the wind blows"; one can imagine that this is possibly a reference to the prevailing winds in the PIE urheimat. 

helix: This came through Greek. Most of the Greek dialects underwent /w/-loss (see e.g. Kavitskaya 2002). The Attic-Ionic dialects lost the sound early (e.g. the sound /w/ and its letter ϝ do not appear in Homer); Aeolian retained it longer but lost it as well. This all leads to the result 

vulva: This came through Italic, which did not undergo /w/-loss. So the PIE semivowel in u̯el- was retained in Latin vol-. The semivowel /w/ was then fricativized in the Romance languages. This leads to the result 

In 2008 Edward Vajda presented his decade-long research into a connection between the Yeniseian languages of central Siberia (e.g. Ket, Yugh) and the American Na-Dené (Athabaskan–Eyak–Tlingit) family. His conclusion was the the languages were indeed related in a Dené–Yeniseian family, a significant finding since if correct it would be the first genetic linguistic connection between the Old and New Worlds. Definitely big news, and as I recall it was generally positively received at the time. I'm interested in understanding: what is the general view in the academic linguistics community of this research now that time has passed to examine it? I'm also curious as to whether Prof Vajda's research is being built upon by any other groups now? 

The Crow language (Apsáalooke) divides verbs into two classes, "Active" and "Stative". The division between classes is based on semantic criteria. The objects of transitive active verbs are marked like the subjects of stative verbs, and there is a different set of pronominal affixes for each verb type. 

"Forgive me, father" usually means something different and quite specific when genuflecting and/or crossing oneself. 

Here is another look at Lovelace's algorithm. Note its remarkable similarity to this Chinese version of Pascal's triangle. 

The Salishan languages Bella Coola (Nuxálk) [Denzer-King, pre-publication[PDF] and 2009[PDF]] has "subtractive counting" for 3, 8 and 9: 

This last is an important point, in my opinion: nearly all authorities agree that language change is driven by social groups, not individuals; so the ability of children to influence change depends on sociolinguistic factors. E.g. modern Western high school students may be an important group due to their wide social influence, but babies are seldom likely to drive change since they have little to no social influence. I think looking at all these the overall effect is that performance errors by children don't have very great effects - but that the process of language acquisition by children influences the type and scope of change. 

Many Romance languages have this distinction. In addition to French foyer noted by @Philippe, there are the Romance cognates Spanish hogar, Galician fogar, with the meaning of "home", from Vulgar Latin focarium, ultimately derived from the Latin focus "hearth". These are distinct from casa "house" (< L.) Notably, Portuguese has lar for "home", derived from the Etruscan (via Latin) LAR. 

This is actually not unique to English. English is nearly what lingusts call an Isolating or Analytic language. An isolating language does not make a lot of use of conjugations, declensions, and other ways of adding affixes onto words. Instead, as the name implies, words stand in isolation and it's the word order and word choice that makes a difference. English is one example of an isolating language. Others include Chinese and Vietnamese. In Chinese adjectives are sometimes considered to be a form of intransitive verb. 

I think this is important since it doesn't restrict itself to morphology and syntax errors, but to phonology, prosody, etc. as well. It also takes into account that adults can learn changes to vocabulary fairly easily; but changes in phonology are almost impossible to acquire past early childhood. 

This "bunched or molar R" sound is widely acknowledged as existing, but has engendered a lot of discussion, not just about its symbol but its exact articulatory nature and even its acoustic distinguishability from a retroflex r. As you note, this sound is discussed at some length in the original Laver 1994 book Principles of Phonetics. Laver himself did not think a satisfactory symbol existed and proposed the symbol ψ (Trask 1996 gives this as Ψ). Laver also suggested potentially using the tongue-root-retraction symbol ̙ (Unicode Combining Right Tack Below) but in a superscript position -- for which there is no Unicode symbol -- in combination with "an existing approximant symbols of suitable lingual and labial attributes". Tellingly, in my opinion, he didn't give an example of what that proposal would look like. Martin Ball in a 2011 poster [link to original Word document] has proposed ɹ̈ (alveolar approximant with the centralization diacritic) which seems reasonable, and has the advantages of being expressible in Unicode and not requiring a non-IPA symbol.
