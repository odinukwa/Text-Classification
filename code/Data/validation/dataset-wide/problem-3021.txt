That is, this boredom works to create a pervasive state of anxiety in which Dasein begins to truly reveal itself. Heidegger and the question of psychology is a great introduction to this line of thought that doesn't require actually reading Heidegger's own characteristically dense (perhaps impossible?) prose. Arthur Schopenhauer (notable, among other reasons, for his profound influence on Nietzsche) also takes up the topic of boredom, arguing that it actually proves the vanity of human existence. He reasons that if life was truly possessive of positive value and real content, then there should be no such thing altogether as boredom. He asks, shouldn't mere existence be enough to both fulfill and satisfy us? The entire book containing this discussion (Essays and aphorisms) is actually available online through Google Books. You might consider reading through it some time when you're, erm, bored. And if you have access to scholarly periodicals through a site like SpringerLink, you might try and ferret out a copy of Patrick Bigelow's The ontology of boredom, which seems like it might be a direct answer to your primary curiosities. 

This is a fascinating question, and as some of the other answers indicate, it has been taken up by an almost dizzying array of philosophers, both from the perspective of moral and political theory. But probably the foremost political philosopher who discusses the suspension of civil liberties during a "state of war" is the Italian philosopher, Giorgio Agamben. Specifically, he uses the term "state of exception" (also translated as "state of emergency") for what your question refers to as a "state of war", and argues that such a situation is often used as a justification for suspending the normal functions of the government in protecting the rights of citizens. Agamben draws heavily here upon the previous work of German thinker Carl Schmitt, both in his definition of "sovereignty" and in the meaning of the term "state of exception". Schmitt argues that sovereignty is really the power of a government to declare a state of emergency. For background reading on his theories, look into what is probably his most famous work, The Concept of the Political. Using Schmitt's terminology and conceptual background, Agamben comes out as a strong critic of modern uses of the "state of exception" as a justification for suspending civil liberties and other important rights. His aptly-titled book, State of Exception, argues that times of crisis have historically and currently allowed governments to increase their power over citizens well over what the law and previous legal precedent actually allows. Acting under the state of exception, in which a government is responding to a supposedly mortal threat, the state can do things that would never be justifiable in normal times, given the working principles and rule of law of that particular state. The state of exception employs justifications that work only in extremes in order to allow the state's own principles to be violated in order for it to save itself. And Agamben doesn't merely write theoretically: He writes specifically about the military order issued by United States President George W. Bush in November of 2001 ("Detention, Treatment, and Trial of Certain Non-Citizens in the War Against Terrorism"), where he specifically defines the category of citizens which are subject to this order, and provides that those labeled as "enemy combatants", despite their status as U.S. citizens, could be detained and tried in military tribunals. It is a very specific and very close-to-home example (at least for many of us in the Western world) of how civil rights and liberties are suspended under the state of exception. Here's a fairly simple summary/introduction to his arguments made in State of Exception : 

With regard to Foucault himself, you are unquestionably missing the point. Foucault repeatedly insisted that he was a historian, not a philosopher. He wasn't interested in solving the world's problems, he was interested in investigating them and writing a genealogy. In fact, it has been problematic for many people that he seems to propose no realistic alternative to biopower. Instead, he says that such relations of power are everywhere and unavoidable. So if biopower is truly inevitable, what are we supposed to do? Foucault is largely silent on that point. He seems to disregard the possibility of alternatives altogether. The best you get is found in the collection of lectures entitled Society Must Be Defended, where he specifically advocates the use of a genealogical analysis of history to confront systems of power. In other places, he haphazardly seems to advocate "resistance", but that's never particularly well-defined The idea is that the only possible alternative to disciplinary forms of power is to recognize the problem and where it's coming from: the end goal of his theories seems to be mere recognition. He praises criticism itself  (i.e., "critical discourse") as being of extreme importance, and as a valuable end in and of itself. But how, specifically, do we resist biopolitical control? And how do we avoid the dangers that he himself cites of our resistance being co-opted by the institutions of power already present in society? In fact, he warns specifically that in setting up a new system (a post-alternative world) is particularly dangerous, because it allows the current system (the current structures of power) to assimilate the movement, blocking off any real chance of reform. He'd probably say that we can't, but many people find that answer quite unsatisfying. There are lots of possibilities proposed by post-Foucauldian scholars, but that would take another entire answer to even brush the surface. The dangers of "labeling" is a fundamental topic throughout critical theory, taken up by an absolutely dizzying array of people, all with their own unique brand of Foucault-inspired resistance. But if you're particularly interested in applying Foucauldian thought to psychiatry, I strongly recommend investigating the works of Thomas Szasz. 

The opposite would be ∉ which denotes that something is not a member of a set. For example, if we say that 

Kant himself (and many other deontologists that follow in his footsteps) would never ask the question: "what if everyone did it?" In fact, it's quite irrelevant to their moral calculi. He famously decrees that: 

If you're interested in this sort of theory, State of Exception is a thoroughly worthwhile read. If you have no prior exposure to Agamben's concept of homo sacer or the theory of "bare life", you may feel a bit lost, as he starts criticizing the state of exception in terms of its ability to deprive people of citizenship and divide the body into two poles—bios and zoe. For conceptual background on this, you'd need to read through his earlier book, Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life. 

Badiou continuously ignores and even refuses to recognize the "suppleness" of power, and its effect on the discourse of alterity. He says that the association of pathos with these forms of alterity is both disruptive and unnecessary, and even attempts to remove alterity and pathos from the equation entirely through the use of mathematical axioms, but this is impossible. Despite the claims made in his works, he is still haunted by an "ineradicable remainder of pathos". Here, you can read the entire earlier works of Emmanuel Levinas (to which Badiou is responding) as themselves indictments of Badiou. Slavoj Žižek is also a critic in some senses (though he possesses an extreme amount of respect for Badiou's thought, describing him as a "giant who walks among us" and likening him to Plato or Hegel), with the primary point of divergence being Žižek's allegiance to Kant and Hegel, contrasted with Badiou's rejection of both. Žižek is very much on the side of "finitude", whereas Badiou attempts to overcome the very problem of finitude. In particular, though Badiou accuses the philosopher's "denial of enjoyment" as making her vulnerable to asceticism, the philosopher can in turn accuse the psychoanalyst (Badiou) as being transfixed by his own enjoyment, particularly since Badiou's argument is that contemporary culture exists almost entirely "under the emblem of enjoyment". Specifically, Bruno Bosteels makes this observation in an article he contributed to Alain Badiou: Key Concepts, edited by Bartlett and Clemens. (Although Bosteels is attempting to clarify and synergize the works of the two theorists, rather than strictly offering a criticism of Badiou.) Gilles Deleuze (and, to a lesser extent, his good buddy, Félix Guattari) is probably Badiou's primary antagonist. Although both interpret philosophy as involving the thinking of the multiplicity, Deleuze stubbornly refuses to give in to Badiou's willingness to cede the thinking of enjoyment to the psychoanalyst. The primary author to consider here is Deleuze's student and contemporary, Eric Alliez. Suggested readings might include his essay "Badiou: the Grace of the Universal" and his contributions to the above-suggested title, Alain Badiou: Key Concepts. Giorgio Agamben also opposes Badiou in his insistence upon the "irreducible remainder". In essence, he argues that the ethic of truth proposed by Badiou actually requires the "occlusion of the remainder", and Agamben's entire understanding of philosophical discourse rests on the potentiality of the remainder, primarily through his central concept of "bare life", which can be interpreted as life which is resting on the very verge of death.
