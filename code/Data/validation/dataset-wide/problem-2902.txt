Oedipus Rex is the earliest example I can think of. The Greeks constructed their plays around what Aristotle would call the "sudden reversal," but was and is more commonly known as the "crisis." This is the part of the play where some decision by the protagonist reverses their fortunes and brings about resolution. I refer to Oedipus because the crisis of the play is the shattering of the protagonist's illusion that he has defeated his fate. At the time, "krisis" merely meant the severance of two parts of the play before and after the judgement of the protagonist. Realize, however, that Aristotle's Poetics held up Oedipus as the archetypal play and formed the basis of Western theater up until the 15th century. So if one makes a careful study of theater during that period between about 300 BCE to about mid-Shakespeare, the crisis of the play more often literally means the loss of the protagonist's illusion of power over their own life. That is likely where the linkage between the two comes, since the two concepts were, historically, not held in proximity. 

The answer to your question depends on what approach you're taking. Unfortunately, we over in the English department tend to ignore philosophical classifications and take up our own. Being that the qualia of the novel builds itself into a personal, introspective narrative, a literary critic (and I would have to agree, given the agreed set of terms in literary studies) would say that this is an existentialist novel. From a philosophical point of view, the novel is certainly absurdist. The only evolution of meaning within the narrative is the slow progression towards realizing the meaninglessness of the universe and the importance of human agency. Just realize that when studying literature, we classify things based on a quality. This novel is introspective. Or this novel explores themes pertaining to the individual. In philosophy, there is a classification of ideas. I suppose the take-away is that literature is a sub-study of aesthetics and will begin its approach with questions about the work's intrinsic value, whereas philosophy would approach the same work with the intent of questioning the validity of the author's ideas. 

You have several questions in here, but I'll address only the title question about the relationship between freedom and democracy. The definition of "democracy" is "rule of majority". This means, that in an isolated democracy, there is absolute freedom of majority opinion (outside influences such as other countries with military power would change the totality of this statement). This structure is not tied to any moral standard (although the majority opinion may be guided by moral standards). If the majority decided that speeding should be punished by immediate death without a trial, then that's what would happen. Democracy is not freedom of any one person (anarchy), democracy is freedom of the majority of a group of people. It should be noted that no democracy can exist in a strictly defined form for long - no current governments are strictly democracies. John Adams said, "Democracy... while it lasts is more bloody than either aristocracy or monarchy. Remember, democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts, and murders itself. There is never a democracy that did not commit suicide." REF 

There are three reasons for the capital punishment: punishment, deterrence, and removal from society. Punishment is questionable. Is it worse to be in prison for 60 years or to die quickly? Is this a martyr case where the offender will actually see death as a reward? For most people, it is a punishment, but it's case-by-case and definitely not certain. Deterrence is commonly cited throughout history and even today. The argument is that loss of life is highly motivating. Without experiencing it, many would think that loss of life is worse than life in prison (maybe those that have experience prison would not agree). If you are in prison, there is always a chance you might be let out, so there is hope in that. Even in a life term case, most societies have pathways for release (executive pardon, for example). Removal from society is really unique for capital punishment. Life in prison requires that the victimized society pay to sustain the murderer, certain people still have to interact with that person, and there is a possibility for release or escape. If he gets out, he may re-offend. If you look at modern society, the cost of keeping someone in prison for 60 years is small relative to all the other things we spend money on, so it doesn't seem like a big negative. However, this question is not relative to a particular culture, so you could imagine a small village that would be greatly burdened by providing room and board to a non-working person. From the perspective of the other people, they want him permanently removed from them and their options are kill him or keep him around, pay for him, and interact with him. So, there's the ethical complication of the survivor's mental and emotional health (which could go either way). Note that there are practical issues to consider outside of the question such as wrongful convictions (OP assumed guilt) and lengthy appeals process that may actually cost more than indefinite incarceration (in some times and places). 

In short, no. At least not under any falsifiable definition of an organism. When biologists refer to a superorganism or an extended phenotype, they aren't referring to a form of life, but the capacity of a species to propagate themselves. Human systems fail the sniff test for life as well. Societies and organizations cannot replicate themselves by way of copying genes. Nor can they conduct respiration, or synthesize proteins. Most importantly, they are not contiguous, which is an absolutely necessary characteristic of an organism. Another argument against is that the concept you refer to is self-insulating. It doesn't open itself up to criticism. Like Freudian psychoanalysis, any refusal to believe that one is an adherent to the proposed system could be dismissed as an "unawareness" of participation. I should add that this does not mean that superorganisms do not exist, but that the sense of the word is entirely non-biologic. It is social. Unless one can make concrete parallels between the biological functioning of living systems and the mechanisms of human society (that is, they function the same without any abstraction from the physical), then it is incorrect to refer to society as a living being. 

Catch-22 refers to a logical dilemma in which both outcomes are either equal or undesirable, rendering it unsolvable. It's not circular logic, but a logical complication of the inevitable outcome(s) of a set of premises. 

All of the above happen regularly. For example, it is common for a new study to provide a highly qualified statement in statistical terms which is then taken up in the media as a "possible" effect which is then repeated as a cause-and-effect which then goes a million directions using the above fallacies and will live on as a misunderstanding for decades. Then when the next study finds overlapping statistical data, the opposite gets said and confusion begins. There are also the legitimate "reversals" of scientific consensus which is merely an update to our understanding of things. People who don't understand the most basic concepts of science don't understand the concept of updating understanding and can only see things in the black and white dichotomy of true or false (hey, there's another one - false dichotomy). 

The goal of gathering information is to gain knowledge. The aim of statistics is to measure the level of certainty in the knowledge we gain from information. That level of certainty is proportional to the number of observed events. Fewer events, less certainty. One event, very little certainty. You also have to consider how closely each anecdote agrees with the others. In general, the variation in anecdotes is large due to the differences in the setup and also in the results. One of the biggest problems with anecdotes is that they are uncontrolled and you really don't know all the inputs and the number of inputs that could affect the result is often huge. Without more information it is usually difficult to turn this information into useful knowledge. Take for example that someone eats a certain plant and is cured of a certain disease. Then another person also eats that plant and gets cured of that same disease. If that is all you know then that is close to useless because those people also ate many other things and did may other things which could all cause an effect, individually or in concert. I'll also reiterate the point about Bayesian statistics. It is essential that you consider prior knowledge in any statistics. If something is thought to be likely you need less proof to "prove" it. Likewise, "extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence". The failure to do this well is endemic in the social and medical sciences largely because there are so many input factors and it is so hard to control studies (think about controlling a study about murder - you can't ethically create this study, so you have to observe the uncontrolled world). But this applies to all anecdotal evidence as well. 

An appeal is, in basic terms, an argument of last resort. In philosophy, ideally, there is no appeal. Either the logic of your premises read out your conclusion or it does not. In a more etymological sense, an appeal is a call out for assistance from a higher power. The word comes from the the Latin appelltus, meaning to entreat. In a very basic sense, we can understand this to mean that an appeal is intended to offload the burden of proof for some argument to some external object. For instance, in the appeal to authority, the appellant (probably the wrong usage there) says, in essence, "if you can prove authority A wrong, then I am wrong." Or in an argument to pity, the appellant says, "to disprove my argument, you must reconcile it with my circumstances." So, in the wider world of rhetoric, an appeal is an argument which attempts to reverse the burden of proof by introducing a factor external to the debate, rather than relying on the logic of the premises. 

Emergence and reductionism aren't generally considered to be opposite concepts, though they are related and sometimes conflict. There are quite a few academics which fall into one camp or another and they occasionally raise their voices to each other. However, philosophy and science is undergoing something of a technocratic revolution. In many journals, one finds that the employment of emergentism or reductionism hinges on the feasibility of their respective explanations. Emergence, in philosophy, can be best described as the Gestalt property of a complex system. In a complex system, behaviors emerge which appear to adapt to conditions for which the system was not intended. In other words: "much arises from little." Reductionism takes a related approach to complex systems by saying that systems are no more than the sum of their parts. Emergence relates closely to human psychology. While a system may appear to exhibit behavior not expected from the interaction of its parts, that appearance is a failure of comprehension, not magical properties of the system. A reductionist approach to emergence attempts to excise that human failure by examining the interaction of a system's components. Especially in psychology and sociology, there is some opposition between reductionists and emergentists. It is understood that this opposition arises from the apparent impossibility of accounting for all the components of the human mind and human society. In short, reductionists do not reject that complex systems have emergent properties, while emergentists often question the ability of scientists to provide a reductionist explanation of the mind and society.

Argument from Silence decribes making conclusions from the absence of evidence and the Association Fallacy may be the closest thing to describing why people write off science in general when they hear a reversal of consensus. More generally, it sounds like your frustration is primarily causes by people's ignorance which is not something you will find easy to fix or describe to them. In flipping through Wikipedia's list of informal fallacies, I have found the following helpful in describing the plethora of ways people misunderstand, misinterpret, and miscommunicate scientific ideas: 

The multiverse theory explains your question directly. It states that the universe was created when "nothing", which is in an unstable state, sprang into equal amounts of matter and anti-matter, energy and anti-energy. When this happened, the sum of these is still equal to "nothing", so it is allowed by physics (or at least not disallowed by our current understanding of physics). This happens an infinite amount of times and thus there are an infinite number of universes - the multiverse. Stephen Hawking, world renowned theoretical physicist, authored "A Brief History of Time" and other books which explain these concepts in detail in a way that non-physicists can understand (i.e. lots of words, few numbers and equations). 

This question is one which is required by a scholastic mindset, but is by no means required. Logic is a language of constraints, and this is what makes it uniquely unable to answer questions about entities for which there are no constraints. The best we can do logically, I think, is to construct (to borrow a CS term) an escape sequence which ejects the question from consideration. There is nothing conditional about an omnipotent being. An omnipotent being, by definition, is an entity who is all capable. Any proposition on the capabilities of such a being is true. If omnipotence implies omniscience, then we must then accept that any proposition on the state of that being must also be true. If we say, "god is capable of granting free will even with perfect foreknowledge," the proposition must be true. If we say, "god has granted free will with perfect foreknowledge," then the proposition must also be true. The converse of these propositions are also true. For a being that can perform all acts and possesses all states, all propositions must be true. If all propositions are true, the propositions are unconditional. Questions must have a condition. Therefore, if there is no condition, there is no question to be had. The question is simply illogical. It does not exist. It's not the answer that is word salad, it's the question. 

Holes (as the word is commonly understood) are almost always filled with something else, so a filled hole can, in at least some cases, still be considered a hole. The most obvious example is a hole dug in the ground. It is filled to the brim with air (which are particles with mass just the same as filling it with sand would be). In many cases, it is also filled with electromagnetic waves of all sorts (light, magnetic field of the earth, UV light, infrared, microwaves, radio waves, etc.) Common knowledge and understanding that not all matter and energy that fills volume can be seen should suffice for documentation.

The CPT Symmetry theory in quantum mechanics might answer your question. It states that if you flip the charge of every particle (C), invert the parity (P) of the universe (reflect the physical coordinates of space (x,y,z) becomes (-x,-y,-z)), and reverse time (T), then the new universe would be indistinguishable from the current universe.
