It is clearly a disk galaxy since the Milky-Way is a stream across the sky and so we conclude that the Galaxy is a highly flattened structure. We observe that external galaxies which are highly flattened are almost all spirals of some form. (Also the stellar populations and arrangement of globular clusters are similar to those of external spirals) Radio surveys/mapping radial velocities of molecular clouds etc. Other (which I'm sure other posters will expand on). 

You seem to be referring to the computation of $m$ in equation (15) for the extinction as the light from the source passes through the atmosphere. The author intends to say that $m\approx \frac{1}{\sin(\alpha_s)}$, where $\alpha_s$ is the altitude of the source (in radian), so restricted to the range $0$ to $ \pi/2$. (Note this is not the inverse of the sine function as the author says but the reciprocal of the sine function) The altitude is the angle measured from the horizon to the source, which is $=\pi/2-\theta$ where $\theta$ is as in figure 2. Note this blows up when $\alpha_s=0$ ($\theta=\pi/2$) because in the simple approximation being used the path length through the atmosphere in infinite. The approximation being used here is that of a flat Earth, and $m$ is the number of equivalent atmosphere heights that the light path travellels through 

It is easy enough to do the calculations, formulae for the in and circum radii of the Platonic solids can be found here which give ratios of circ to in radii of (note formulea for the radii have dropped common factor of the side length, which we don't need as we are interested in the ratios): 

If you look at raw resolving power you get for a 10m optical telescope: $\theta_{optical}\approx \frac{5\times 10^{-7}}{10}\approx 5 \times 10^{-8}$ radian. For a synthetic aperture ground based radio telescope operating at 21cm the limiting aperture is of the order of the diameter of the Earth so: $\theta_{21cm}\approx \frac{21\times 10^{-2}}{12\times 10^{6}}\approx 1.75 \times 10^{-8}$ radian. So in this case the resolution of the radio telescope is somewhat better than that of the optical. In the absence of adaptive optics the situation is even more favorable to the radio telescope since we can achieve its theoretical resolution, but ground based optical telescopes are constrained to lower resolutions by atmospheric seeing. Also adaptive optics still do not improve the resolution of optical systems fully to the diffraction limit of the aperture. 

The question can be rephrased into: How many exoplanets have been found that could harbour life? As of early May 2015 the number appears to be about 30, see the Habitable Exoplanet Catalog on the Planetary Habitability Laboratory's web site. You should also note that exoplanet detection methods will bias this sample in favour of Super-Earths. 

The Summer Solstice in 2016 will occur at 22:34 UT on the 20th June, and the full moon will occur at 11:02 UT on that day (but since they are 12 hours apart that won't be on the same day everywhere). Solstice data from here (GMT- Grenwich Mean Time =UT) 

First, Azimov was writing (Edge 1982, and Earth 1986) before the first extra solar planets were tentatively detected (1989), or definitely detected 1991 or 1992. So what he wrote could not be based on any real data on extra solar planets, and must have been an educated guess. However both books were written after the discovery of Charon, so he may have been ill advised to claim that large moons were unlikely around non-gas giants. Personally I think both the large moon and broad planetary ring guesses are unlikely to pan out. Uncommon maybe but not uncommon enough for Azimov's purpose. If you believe it, we have already discovered an exoplanet with a more impressive ring system than Saturn's 

Assuming these are all in floating point and you are subsequently handling the potential overflow of time into the next day correctly... 

It is very unlikely. While the hypothetical planet Vulcan between Mercury and the Sun was ruled out many decades ago searches for Vulcanoid asteroids would very likely have detected anything that might qualify as a intra-Mercurial planet. 

There is no boundary there is no outside to be expanding into. Only slightly misleading is the usual analogy of the expansion of the universe is that of the surface of a balloon as it is blown up, which just gets larger but has no boundary. One problem with the balloon analogy is that with a balloon we can see that it is embedded in a 3-space, but there is no need for such a 4-space embedding for the Universe. Another problem is that the surface of the balloon is very definitely finite, we don't really know if that is the case or not for the Universe. 

You would/should be able to detect the annihilation of electron-positron pairs at the boundary between normal-matter and anti-matter space. This has a distinctive energy and so could be identified unambiguously. For an example of the detection of electron-positron annihilation see this NASA news item. 

When your professor refers to your "local star" he is referring to the Sun.By a "local star" he may mean any star within the "local bubble" which has a size ~100 parsecs (300 or so ly). Though he may also just be using the term loosely with no defined meaning other than nearby. 

The surface brightness of an extended source in independent of distance. So for the surface brightness of a large spiral go look at M31 (The Great Galaxy in Andromeda) . What will change with distance is the apparent size, but the surface brightness will remain the same. The surface brightness of a near edge-on galaxy will be greater than one face-on due to the greater number of stars close to any sight-line, and the integrated brightness will of course vary with distance. 

This is not an answer but a comment which is too long to post as such. There is no such thing as a scientifically approved theory, there are theories consistent with the evidence some of which are simpler in some sense than others, and philosophy of science tells us that we should prefer those that are simpler. Also I doubt that the big-bang theory is what you think it is, which is simply that at a certain time in the past the Universe was in a hot dense state which then expanded, forming the lightest chemical elements... The first part of this is a simple extrapolation of the observation of the way that galactic Doppler shift increases with distance and the observed cosmic microwave background. The second part is the consequence of the application of well know nuclear properties of matter. Now there are plenty of more-or-less widely accepted additions to this, mainly to explain the uniformity and fluctuations in the microwave background, and the emergence of first stars and galaxies etc. But all of these are to some extent speculative since we have no generally accepted unification of Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity or require physics that has no predicted consequence (so far) beyond the phenomena it has been proposed in order to explain. To make this approximate an answer I will point you to the Wikipedia page on Non-Standard Cosmologies 

There are plenty of online planetarium sites which should be able to do this for you. This one is the first hit for a Google search for "online planetarium software" 

There is a preferred standard of rest, that of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). You can detect motion with respect to the microwave background. So move fast with respect to the background and the CMB in the direction of motion will be blue-shifted and in the opposite direction will be red-shifted compared to a direction orthogonal to the direction of motion. The Earth motion has been measured with respect to the CMB, see here You could/can also detect your motion from the anisotopy of galactic red-shift in the same way. 

The lines that appear in a stars spectrum mainly reflects its temperature not its composition, see here O-type stars start out with the same sort of composition as other stars, that is they are mainly H and He (approximately 75% and 25% by mass) with traces heavier elements. 

Because of the inverse square law for Newtonian gravity we have the acceleration due the gravity $g_b$ at the surface of the Earth due to a body of mass $m_b$ at a distance $d_b \gg r_e$ (where $r_e\approx 6371 \mbox{km}$ denotes the radius of the Earth, note all distances will need be in $\mbox{km}$ in what follows) is: $$ g_b=g\times \frac{m_b}{m_e}\times \left(\frac{r_e}{d_b}\right)^2 $$ where $g$ is the usual accelleration due to gravity (from the Earth at the Earth's surface $\approx 10 \mbox{m/s}^2$, and $m_e\approx 6.0 \times 10^{24} \mbox{kg}$. We get the maximum acceleration due to a body when that body is at its closest to the Earth, which is what we do from now on (except for the Sun and Moon where the mean distance is used). Now for the Moon $r_b\approx 0.384 \times 10^6 \mbox{km}$, and $m_b\approx 7.3 \times 10^{22} \mbox{kg}$, so the accelleration at the Earth's surface due to the Moon $g_b\approx 3.3 \times 10^{-5} \mbox{m/s}^2$ Then putting this relation and Solar-System data into a spread sheet we get: 

The flattening of a planet is a function of both its spin rate and its structure. But for a series of planets of homologous structure the flattening depends on the spin rate. the faster it spins the greater the flattening (for spin rates typical of planets any way). So if a planet is spinning slowly it will display little polar flattening, similarly if it does not show flattening it should be spinning slowly. 

: etc This really has nothing to do with radio telescopes per se, but is common to all telescopes including optical. 

It would appear to have been developed by Carl Pulfrich working for Zeiss in 1904. Alternatively Max Wolf in 1900 again working with the Zeiss company. Looks like the idea was Wolf's and the realisation Pulfrich's. From the second link we have: 

The solar spectrum peaks somewhere near green, but that is not directly relevant to its apparent colour which is a result of the actual spectrum and the sensor response. If there is enough intensity in the pass bands of the three colour sensors for them to saturate the sensor will apparently record "white". This is true of camera sensors, film and the eye. The light from the Sun at the bottom of the atmosphere peaking in the yellow is only a secondary factor in your perception of the colour of objects around you. If Sun light were mono-chromatic, that is concentrated in a very narrow band, say at yellow, then everything would appear yellow, like under sodium street lighting. But it is not mono-chromatic and the eyes perception of the colour of an object is effectively the result of the different reflectivity at different frequencies as sensed through three relatively wide bandwidth colour filters. the visual system is also doing a lot of other things to make the perceived colour of objects more or less constant under differing lighting conditions.
