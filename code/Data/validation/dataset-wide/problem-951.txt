Nikolov & Zeller have published a paper concerning what they call The Unified Theory of Climate. $URL$ Please read the paper in full and then answer my question. Personally I can see no areas in which the new theory is compatible with the current theory of the Greenhouse Gas Effect and Anthropogenic Global Warming however there are some extremely knowledgeable participants on this site so I welcome their input but only, please, if you have read the whole paper. 

I like this question as it makes you think about lots of things. Answering the question specifically gives me, based on my own somewhat incomplete knowledge of human history, the answer: Not really, no specific examples of human catastrophe from warming. So now we wonder why.Clearly the concept of an average global temperature (as used in discussing climate change) is a mathematical construct and does not represent a temperature where all people live , to be crude about it. The earth has poles (very cold) and equator (very hot). Humans tend to live in the bits in between. If climate changed gradually we would expect humans to move gradually further north or further south if it started to become uncomfortable or difficult. However we know from personal experience that we go on holiday where it is hotter, often much hotter, and cope very well for a fortnight even for a temperature increase of 20 degrees C. When it get really cold however, say in a harsh winter in England, and the temperature is sub zero, maybe -15 degress C, for a few days we find it much harder to cope. Maybe if we plot a graph of "human copeability" v local environment temperature change it will be nowhere near linear. The other factor that comes to mind is that cooling produces ice and snow which are physical things you need to deal with, e.g. effect on transport and also can be a tipping point for certain crops e.g. frost damage. So just a few unusually cold days/nights could destroy a crop wheras it takes a more prolonged excess of heat to damage crops, again probably a non linear graph. Overall I expect we may find human populations that live in the colder parts of the planet are living much nearer to the "edge" of survivabilty compared to those living in the hottest parts of the planet. I seem to remember reading somewhere that humans originated in Africa (a hot bit) so our "design" is for near equator temperatures +- (some range). 

This is a good question because it prompts one to think about the many and varied natural sources of CO2 in the atmosphere. Of course your measuring apparatus will only show NET CO2, i.e. Sources-Sinks. So you need to think about CO2 sinks too. Start by making a list of all the possible sources and sinks. Then consider which apply in any given location for the apparatus. I would suggest that one of the main sources would be plant life so you will find quite a difference between an instrument in a tropical rainforest compared to a dry desert. The ocean measurements will be interesting as oceans contain dissolved CO2 and it tends to come out as the temperature goes up. In reality a bit more complicated owing to exact surface exchange mechanisms, partial pressure of CO2 in the atmosphere , etc. You starting guess of +/- 10-20ppm looks low compared to my own guess. I would have said +/- 50-100 but it would indeed have been a guess like yours. 

Initial theories of the atmosphere assumed that it was "well mixed". You will see that term mentioned in many articles, and also the fairly made point that it is an assumption. Historical measurements of CO2 concentration had been pretty sporadic with the exception of Mauna Loa. It's instructive to look at the raw data from that observatory and the adjustments made to produce a smooth curve to view changes year by year. Note also the daily variations due to plants. A NASA satellite was launched in 2014 to measure CO2 high in the atmosphere so there is now evidence CO2 is not well mixed but we do not have enough data to look at long term trends as it has not given us even 3 years worth of data yet. It seems to be claimed that about 40% of the CO2 produced from burning fossil fuels comes to show itself as CO2 concentration increases. The rest must go somewhere else (or we got the calculation wrong !). It is often assumed 30-40% goes into the oceans. Although I have seen claims that the earth has greened by about 18% in the past 40 years (increased intensive agriculture) I have not seen the increased CO2 from this source taken into account yet in calculating which proportion of the CO2 increase in the atmosphere is due to that. At a first examination this would seem to be quite important. If the 18% greening is responsible for a significant percentage of CO2 increase then clearly fossil fuel CO2 is less important. This looks like an important area that needs to be looked at. Maybe careful study of satellite data over green areas compared to deserts/ice will reveal something. 

Google Radiative (or radiation) absorbtion coefficients for gases (or enter specific gas of interest). Most of this data relates to applications in combustion and refrigeration so that is the area to look at. To avoid "contamination" from all the global warming stuff try looking at older things like papers from the 1950's. I have some detailed refrigeration books from the 50's which I think had this data but not to hand right now. Or see if you can get hold of some books like that from your library or a bookstore. Many gases were studied in great detail with proper experimental measurements to verify well before global warming was a thing. You can find graphs of lots of useful things which can help you with an understanding of how the various gases might work in the atmosphere. For example using the emissivity of CO2 to calculate radiative heat transfer in the atmosphere with the standard Stefan-Boltzmann equation when you know the concentration of CO2 is, say, 400ppmV. Emissivity of CO2 can be surprisingly low at atmospheric concentrations, temperatures and pressures, less than 0.002 typically. 

The theory of a Gravity Induced Lapse Rate proposed by Loschmidt (1876) suggests that all planetary bodies will have a temperature gradient in their atmosphere AND in the solid structure of the planet all the way to the core. If this theory is correct then the hot inner core of planets with an atmosphere is a common feature of all such bodies. It is (we think) obviously the case that life does not form on all such bodies but only on a select few. The features of the hot core, cooler surface & gaseous atmosphere would not then be the deciding factor as to whether we have a lifeless planet or not. If we assume, like the question, that life requires a certain temperature range then the main deciding factor will be the surface temperature as we expect life to be moving, swimming or flying about pretty close to the surface (generally). The 2 main deciding factors would be distance from the star and composition of the atmosphere, next factor is probably rotational speed on axis.
