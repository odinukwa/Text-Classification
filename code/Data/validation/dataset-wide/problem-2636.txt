There is some difficulty with the idea "the Universe=computer". This computer can do one step from one state to another, but why should the machine make such a step at all? Why she does not stick forever at one state? The logical schema is inherently static; it cannot say anything about the time and the change. For any particular computer the problem of change does not matter - this computer is realized somewhere as a physical entity, so nobody care of where the change comes from. In the case when the Universe is declared to work as a computer and nothing more, this problem starts to be too serious and it cannot be ignored. Apparently, the computer model being blind towards the time implies - there is something beyond its scope; this "something" pushes the world to change in time, some phenomena start to be, and others disappear. In other words - the model is incomplete. For my opinion, this kind of universal Pythagorean project should fail (as all other kinds, probably). 

I'm assuming you mean a graduate degree. If you mean an undergraduate degree, you can disregard all subsequent paragraphs. But I will say it's highly unlikely that you'll be able to genuinely answer any deep and pressing philosophical questions for yourself solely from obtaining a BA in philosophy. You would need many more years than that, along with more in-depth research. Even a Master's degree would only allow you to dip your toes in the shallow end. As far as PhD goes, I think it very well could help you answer your life-long questions, but it would also make them look more complicated to you. In fact, you should reflect on what kind of answer you are looking for. I know many very thoughtful people who ask genuine questions, but are quite satisfied by simple, unsystematic answers; their eyes will glaze over when confronted with the kinds of details a PhD in philosophy works with. This will give you a more precise understanding, but at the same time can be immensely tedious and disconnect you from the basic "folk" philosophical concerns of the layman. You have to decide what you are really after. Here are some other factors I would urge you to take into serious consideration. First, you should understand that graduate programs in philosophy are geared toward training you to be a professional in the field, at least at schools in the top 50 or so of the Philosophical Gourmet, for example. That doesn't mean you can't go there and take some courses and write a good dissertation and learn a whole lot about philosophy. But a lot of the actions of your mentors might be geared toward getting you into a research field that is seen as viable for getting jobs, and in getting material to write you good recommendation letters. If you are up front with your advisors about your intent, it is possible that they will see you as being less worth their time, since they will gain nothing in professional terms for the time they put in with you. Make no mistake about it, many of the top professional "philosophers" are out there to build a career first and foremost; genuine philosophical concern is often secondary. So, if you do go, you may want to consider how straightforward you are with your advisors about what you are doing. Second, graduate programs in philosophy are highly non-standardized. Different faculties will have different specializations, and different faculty members will have their own specializations. Even an epistemologist will usually have some specific subfield of epistemology, for example, that may be wildly orthogonal to your actual interests. Don't go accepting a position at a school just because you got in. Only go if there are at least two faculty members there that are quite in line with what you want to do, quite specifically. I say this because there is no substitute for actual face-to-face interaction with the top people in the field when you want to get to the cutting edge of a philosophical question. If you're at a graduate program where there aren't any top people with connections to other top people in the questions you are specifically interested in, you may well find that they can't really help you get to the bottom of your questions, not any better than you could have done on your own trawling through the literature. Third, and maybe most obviously, do not accept a position that is not fully funded. This will usually include some kind of teaching duties, so keep that in mind. If you hate teaching or aren't willing to do it to fund your degree, you might have a hard time. Also, despite being fully-funded, your income will be very difficult to get by on. Depending on costs of living and your specific funding package, you may have to adjust your lifestyle in ways that are uncomfortable and undesirable. If you have a significant other, you can expect your bank account to be at 0 at the end of every month, and if you have a family to support then you'd better have some kind of independent means IMO. Fourth, consider the amount of time of your life it will take, and how that time will be spent in a mundane sense. It is not uncommon to take 7 years to complete a PhD in philosophy. If investigating this question is how you want to spend the next 7 years, then by all means it may be completely worthwhile. But you should also consider what you'll do on the other side. In the midst of a PhD program it is very easy to forget about all other aspects of life. Have some back up plans and an exit route. You may find that 7 years of mostly solitary working in your room with books harmful to your psyche in certain ways, and you should expect quite frequently to lose sight of your original intentions. You will be around people who are desperate for professional opportunity, you will have to listen to them constantly talk about their anxieties about the job market, and you will have to deal with the politics that comes along with that sort of thing. It will take a strong sense of self and a strong support network to keep yourself reminded of your inmost intentions and get to the end of the program. 

It is supposed generally, that a moral choice is a conscious one: the agent knows exactly, what she is doing and what moral implications or consequences her act has (no matter that in reality she, may be, has no time for any reflection). If her intention is immoral, so the act will not get a moral value. Usually, others have no access to this conscious content and can only guess or calculate it. Nevertheless, they need this content in order to assign properly the moral value to the act of the agent. Note that in this particular case the conditions of the problem suppose that this content is known for us. One can expect that a feeling of gratitude to this killer would captivate people and it will show an indulgence to her... overall behavior. However, not all would be captivated, and less of all the police. Update 1. I would propose to resolve the question by using notions of public and private. People actions are public - they are accessible for everybody and everybody can give her opinion on them. The thoughts of the agent are the other thing - we do not know them. However, I would say, that they could be divided in two parts. One part consists of nearest intentions â€“ intentions properly speaking. In the current case, these intentions are (a) she wishes to kill a dangerous person with explicit consent of the society (b) she refrains from killing innocent people. She has made her choice, and this choice is explicit. In other words, it belongs somehow to the public domain and we have right to discuss it, may be to ask the agent about it and so on. Her other thoughts are from the private domain - agent's feelings, her selfish wishes, fear of jail etc - we have no moral rights to refer to them and to use them when elaborating our judgment about moral value of her acts. For example, I can suspect that this killer has some evil wishes. Anyway, I have no right to express my suspect and should be respectful to her as would be to any other moral person, because from the moral point of view she acts appropriately and makes right choice - (a) and (b). 

THe program of Universal Logic is mostly considered a joke by the professional logicians I have talked to. There seem to be two popular conceptions of logic among philosophers who think about logic. But before going into these, you have to understand first that, among present-day logicians, the philosophical concerns are most frequently secondary or tertiary if they are even taken into consideration at all. Today mathematical logic has taken on a life of its own and has merged for many with computer science in particular ways. It is, in general, a branch of mathematics. Thus, for a good majority of logicians, engaging in the study of the properties of a non-classical logic is frequently done for its own sake, not much different from studying the properties of any mathematical structure. It's also frequently done in view of computer science. The point here being that much logic done today is not motivated primarily by philosophical concerns, and rarely will you see logicians even engaging in the kinds of arguments you are talking about. But among philosophical logicians and philosophers who think about logic, there seem to be two streams of thought. First, there seems to be the view that logic can form the structural core of a metaphysics. This view is that of Williamson and his followers in his Modal Logic as Metaphysics. It is in this sense that there could be a correct logic for propositions that you are looking for. But today I think you'll have trouble finding anyone who thinks classical logic forms the core of a metaphysics, since modal metaphysics is in. So it's usually modal logics dealing with necessity that are taken to be a structural core of a metaphysics, since they can deal with dependence and grounding structures in a way that non-intensional classical logics cannot. The other guiding conception of logic that has emerged with the dominance of mathematical logic is logic as a tool, either in the sense of an organon or in the sense of an intellectual tool-kit. On this conception of logic is the device by which philosophers start from premises and draw conclusions. In the sense of organon, then, logic prepares the way for science by providing the device by which one may generate new conclusions from premises. With the proliferation of non-classical logics, many take a quite pluralistic approach. Any logical system has paradigm cases and problem cases. With a pluralistic conception, one simply uses whichever logical systemâ€™s paradigm cases conform most closely to the matters at hand, be it a classical or non-classical mathematical logic, a dialectical or Hegelian logic, or something else. Personally the last time I have seen arguments regarding the "correct" logic in the sense you are discussing is back in the Quine-Montague days. Quine's arguments were quite frequently motivated by a concern with preserving the classical meanings of the first-order logical terms, which indicates his endorsement of classical logic as the "correct" one. But these arguments are not really going on today, and certainly not among logicians. 

refers to something like a universal moral principle, so one is tempted to assert that such a principle somehow exists. However, any objective location of moral values and laws (God, world harmony or like) is very difficult to concord with the condition that morality arises from personal convictions of people that translate them in judgments and acts. These convictions are its ultimate source, and people assume their responsibility for them as well as for what follow from them. If one puts the source of morality somewhere beyond human consciousness, it would mean that some part of the responsibility could be transferred to this moral authority. By the way, this is why many atheists seriously opposed to religious vision of moral - people can through off their responsibility to the God, which undermines moral; I would say that this objection is no less important than those contra atheist position, that you mention. Another difficulty with the objective view of the morality is the fact that it is impossible to fix its content. The life is changing all the time and old and established meanings become sometimes useless or do not work. We can see many moral problems - euthanasia, gay marriages, abortion etc - and, apparently, this objective law cannot resolve them. 

The sentence is not a huge problem to treat logically, but it does require a stipulated way of treating indexicals to ensure that it will behave logically the way it seems it should (to be true whenever uttered, yet contingently so). So, contrary to what others have said, it is a sentence that holds some interest in logic as a paradigm of an indexical sentence whose propositional content varies across circumstances and yet remains true whenever uttered. For example, Kaplan's influential treatment of indexicals and demonstratives is known as a "two-dimensional" account of indexicals. On such an account, you can guarantee that the sentence "I am here now" will come out true, while still preserving within your logical representation of the proposition expressed the sense of contingency and the structure of that contingency. More generally, I would offer, looking at the logical properties of such a sentence can teach us about how indexicals work in the language, and, depending upon your view of the relation between semantics and ontology, may even hold metaphysical lessons (of course this would require argumentation). You might look at the following SEP articles to dig deeper into the study of indexicals and two-dimensional treatment of them if that interests you: $URL$ $URL$ 

Surely, now we do not consider such proofs as proofs. However, it reveals some truth. If one conceives two independent substances, she should accept that they would interact. An interaction would demand a common ground, therefore it will undermine the independence and a monism becomes inevitable. One can point to Christian God - he can influence without being influenced, but one can argue that this construction is too abstarct or too artificial. 

My remark is, probably, trivial, but people discuss moral properties of various persons, including gods and demons, in order to express their own vision of what is good and what is wrong. From this point of view it does not matter who is the subject of the discussion. Therefore, when you are debating the moral properties of deities, you, first, are debating this vision of this concert opponent, and are advancing what do you think about what is good and what is wrong. Again, this is trivial, may be, but this means that there is a merit even in such discussing. 

You might want to look into Husserl's Crisis of the European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology. He explicitly states the problem in Sections 52-54, and calls it "the paradox of human subjectivity." However, you should be aware that his explication would make more sense if you have read the whole work. In general, his solution to this problem seems to me to be the underlying thesis of the whole work and one of the primary positive points of theory in his phenomenology. Merleau-Ponty takes up parallel themes in his Phenomenology of Perception. In general, the phenomenologists would be good references for this sort of thing. EDIT: I should also mention that Husserl's development of the issue is in more ontological terms than your naturalistic formulation. For him, there is a constitutive connection between consciousness and reason. Consciousness constitutes the world through meaning, and meaningful structures are limited by rationality. Husserl is also distinctly not a mind-body dualist. So the contours of the problem are going to be different, but I see the same basic difficulty here, i.e., the thrust of the question remains: how can it be that a part of the world (consciousness) constitutes the whole world?
