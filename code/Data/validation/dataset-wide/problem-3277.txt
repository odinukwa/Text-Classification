Thus, even before the overthrow of the Shah in 1979, the big picture was available to be known. However, there was limited interest in the story in the US at that time. Most public attention was focused on the Cold War and people in the US tended to see any opposition to US policy as the operation of proxies of the Soviet Union. 

English noble titles, even when related to a geography, did not have the same connotation of domination over a geographical area that continental titles did. Thus, in 1450, the Duke of Norfolk had castles in Norfolk, but also in Wales and in the north of England. He was expected to respond to his sovereign's call and go wherever he was needed. He was not responsible for the administration of the shire of Norfolk; it was more important that he be able to project power into Wales or to the Scottish border. For military men, the title is meant to commemorate the location of an achievement, rather than to indicate possession. 

I ask because I don't understand how these weapons could pose a danger for the U.S. Note: From my country I don't have free access to the book cited in the question and this is the reason why I didn't post a more expanded quote. 

While both above quotes are quoted from Wikipedia, it seems there is no concordance between the two in reference to how tall insulae were. In fact, whereas the first quote refer to '10 and more storeys', the second claims as exceptional the case that insulae were made up by 'nine storeys'. Can anybody shed a bit of light on this matter, possibly explaing how tall insulae were and the reason why these divergences exist? 

The short answer is that, if Germany sat and waited while Russia mobilized, the Germans believed they would be crushed between France and Russia. Imperial Russia was considered to be a powerful nation because they could put so many men in the field. Russia's inability to properly equip or supply them was not properly understood. The German war plan was to overwhelm France before Russian strength could be massed against Germany. France also knew the odds and directed railway investment into Russia as long as the railways led to the European frontier [Tuchman, Guns of August], in order to reduce the time it would take for Russia to mobilize and apply her forces against Germany. 

In addition to the reasons already given above, the South also believed that Europe could not survive without Southern cotton. At the beginning of the war, Southern merchants organized a cotton embargo to provoke Britain to enter the war on their side. However, Britain had sufficient stocks of cotton to last a year, and was already working to develop alternate sources of supply in Egypt. The overwhelming support for the Confederacy that southerners expected in Britain never materialized. 

After reading the reasons of the Medal, which seem really remarkable, and after taking into account the exceptional nature of the event—since the end of the WWII, it has never happened that an American ship had been attacked and almost destroyed—I wonder what event or cerimony the president was attending during the award to McGonagle. Therefore, my question is: What was the president doing during the award to McGonagle—was he perhaps abroad? 

In the continental Army during the American Revolution, soldiers traditionally wore their hair braided in the back and secured by a ribbon, but in 1801 General James Wilkinson issued an order requiring all soldiers to cut their ponytail. However, as is well known, Colonel Thomas Butler refused to cut his ponytail. After reading several sources on the Internet I cannot understand whether Colonel Thomas Butler was or was not prosecuted/arrested. Wikipedia talk of "attempting to prosecute" and says that "Colonel Butler died before the trials closed," as if he was not actually prosecuted, whereas Stephen McDonald and William Salomone, reporting a piece that I didn't find elsewhere on the Internet, say that he was arrested. 

Since we need an older source, rather than a current source, I will quote The Seven Sisters (1975) by Anthony Sampson, which contains an entire chapter on the affair. 

The U-boat of WWI was not nearly the weapon that it became in the next war. Holger Herwig documented the limitations of the U-boat in his book The First World War: Germany and Austria-Hungary 1914-1918. U-boats were primitive and prone to various failures. The means of radio communication with a submerged vessel were still underdeveloped. Germany had no answer for the convoy. The Germans did not have the resources to fight a two-front war and build an effective submarine fleet. In 1917 they were only able to keep at most 30 subs on station west of Britain at any time. The German U-boat did not threaten the British lifelines. Herwig documents the countermeasures that Britain implemented, including rationing and setting insurance rates to prevent a breakdown in world maritime trade. 

St Sebastian, who was an early saint and martyr killed during the Roman emperor Diocletian's persecution of Christians, is commonly referred to as a gay male icon. Wikipedia reads: 

As is well known, after the WW2 ended, the U.S. imposed a strong program of demilitarization to Germany. Can anybody explain the reason why the "antique guns and swords from the Franco-Prussian War"—to which Edward Norman Peterson refer in the book "The American Occupation of Germany: Retreat to Victory"—made part of that demilitarization program. 

The USS Liberty incident was an attack on a United States Navy technical research ship, USS Liberty, by Israeli Air Force jet fighter aircraft and Israeli Navy motor torpedo boats, on 8 June 1967, during the Six-Day War.The combined air and sea attack killed 34 crew members (naval officers, seamen, two Marines, and one civilian), wounded 171 crew members, and severely damaged the ship. William Loren McGonagle (November 19, 1925 – March 3, 1999) was a United States Naval officer who received the Medal of Honor for his actions while in command of the USS Liberty when it was attacked. The Medal of Honor was presented to him at the Washington Navy Yard by the Secretary of the Navy, rather than at the White House by the President. So, as John Thurber commented in a obituary article in The Los Angeles Times on March 11, 1999, "[w]hen Navy Capt. William L. McGonagle received his Medal of Honor, it was not bestowed on him by the president, as is customary, or even presented at the White House. McGonagle, who died last week at 73, was given his award in the relative seclusion of a shipyard near Washington by the Navy secretary". His Medal of Honor citation reads:
