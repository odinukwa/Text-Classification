Yes, it's perfectly safe to use the next larger size tube in a smaller tire. It's a common trick used by bike messengers to reduce the chance of flats. The only downside is a slightly heavier wheel since you're using more tube that you really need. 

Even with platform pedals, a stiffer shoe will help. If you're riding in squishy running shoes, switching to a shoe that is stiffer with less cushion will improve your riding. Those all mountain flats would be fine, or even skate shoes. However, unless multi-day refers to a month or more, I would really encourage you to look into getting clipless pedals and bike specific shoes. 500 miles is a long ways on a bike, everything you can do to improve efficiency and comfort will help. Having said that, you don't need to invest in new pedals right away and any reasonably stiff shoe will help. ( Some people like riding in dress shoes. ) Once you've gotten some miles under your belt, you can look at the issue of pedals again. 

In my personal experience, anything you wear while riding that is even moderately water proof will trap heat and sweat and for me, I will end up just as wet if I had ridden with or without the jacket. GoreTex and the like are just riding an edge of being helpful. Short rides, cool temps, perfect. Long rides, doesn't matter, you are going to get wet. From the inside or the outside. :) 

I am actually living in the NYC region now (NJ, other side of the GW) and I am too chicken to try the hill from the GW on the way home once the road is wet. That is too steep and long to do in my mind. So I would say weather here is not too extreme, more wet than really cold. My wife bought me this nice heavy winter coat (not for biking, rather for wearing to work etc) that I have worn 3 times in 5 years now. But I may be odd that way, not getting all that cold. For bike riding I used a MEC (Mountain Equipment Coop, Canadian store, sort of like REI and EMS) jacket that was windproof on the front, fleece on the back. I would pump out steam in cold weather, when I stopped at a light. Strange site to see. 

This would never work due to fact that no force would be transmitted to the rear wheel until the derailleur cage was at maximum extension. The derailleur has to be below the chainstay to allow it to take up the slack in the chain. I suppose you could split the derailleur into to parts, one to keep the chain tension and the other to change gears, but that seems excessively complex. The real solution to the derailleur problem is an internally geared hub. 

You can easily put a 26t chainwheel on the front crank. I've done that on a couple bikes, because 30/39/52 makes for a stupidly redundant set of gears with anything like a wide range cassette on the back. It will likely take some tweaking of the front derailler setup to get it working properly, switching to a 50 from a 52 can help with that. It isn't an out of the box recommendation since you are slightly exceeding the manufacturers specifications for both front and total ranges, but in practice it works just fine. I would recommend installing some kind of chain keeper like the Deda Dog fang. This will help avoid dropped chains when shifting from the middle to small chainring. As far as changing the rear cassette goes, you should be able to use a Shimano 9speed HG 12-36 and it's generally just cheaper to buy the whole cassette than individual rings. If your current cassette isn't worn, you can mix and match rings to build a custom cassette. However, switching cassettes doesn't really solve the problem as well as a smaller chainring would IMHO. A good granny will give you a few choices in climbing. If you go to just the 36t in the back, you've only added one lower gear and you'll be "stuck" there. If you are doing a lot of loaded touring, I would recommend replacing the entire front crank altogether. Standard road triples 130/74 BCD don't make a lot of sense for touring. A 110/74 or even a 9 speed MTB crank 22/32/44 will give a more useable set of gears. Personally, I would take a long look at the Surly Mr Whirly crank for touring. It uses modern bearings and you can get a replaceable spider to allow for whatever front gears you like. IMHO, the old MTB standard 58/94 is ideal for loaded touring. 20/30/42 allows you to use a relatively close range on the back and still get all the gears you need. If you do go this route, you might need to replace the front derailuer as well. Keep poking around on Sheldon Brown's pages, there is lot's of good info there. 

Even if you do not go as far as different rims, consider different tires. Slicks (1.25") vs the regular tires (2+ inches) will make a huge difference, and usually can be found for $30 a tire or so in the US or Canada. Beyond that, remove unnecessary hardware. Front shocks are probably the worst thing you might have on the bike. I do not know if it is worth considering a hard fork just for this race or not. 

I find it hard to imagine you could get a carbon seat post catastrophically fail. (I say that as someone who has broken a Titanium seat rail, a Ti frame in three places, and a Ti stem. Generally on a very stiff frame, (like Aluminum) getting a carbon front fork, carbon seat post can help absorb some of the harshness of the frame. 

Often while mountain biking a twig or rock will get stuck between the swing arms on your front derailleur. This effectively locks the derailleur in place until the rock/twig works itself out. If it happens again, stop and examine the derailleur. Generally you can't see the obstruction while you're riding. 

Your big chainring should have those features. If it doesn't get a new ring. Race Face and Black Spire make 110BCD rings with pins and ramps in cross racing sizes. 

Two is the killer problem, take the crank and 11 speed chain and see if it getting caught between the rings is a real problem. If not, it's worth a shot. You won't break anything by trying it and you'll have to decide if you can live with the changes in shifting performance. 

I like that MEC jackets in general. But as you note, you will often get pretty sweaty with anything that does not vent hugely. Even in the most expensive GoreTex jacket you are still going to get sweaty. I am not convinced there is any actual great solution. There are just a series of lesser evils. MEC used to have a jacket long discontinued, and I treasure my one remaining example, that was SuperMicroft on the front, over polar fleece, and similar put different outer feel polar fleece for the back half. I rode in this as a winter coat for a decade. The idea is the front blocks the wind, the back vents the heat/sweat. In the winter, if I stopped at a light, my back would be steaming as the heat flows out. This was the best bet, since literally half you upper body surface area is a vent. Alas they (and Europe Bound) no longer sell them (at least last I looked, nor can I find them in the online catalog). I loved how in Toronto, every time MEC moved, Europe Bound opened a store across the street. That was pretty funny as a business plan! (Like when Starbucks opened in Toronto the joke was they mapped out all the Second Cup stores and opened as close as they could find a spot. No clue if really true, but sure looked that way!) 

You are overthinking the problem. Ultimately the stopping force needs to be transmitted to the center of mass. In either rim or disk brakes the force is transmitted through the spokes to the hub and via the hub connection to the frame to the center of mass of bike and rider. It doesn't really matter if the rim is decelerating wrt to the hub ( rim brake ) or the hub is decelerating wrt to the rim ( hub/disk brake ), the force is exactly the same just in the opposite direction. However in either case, the force is far less than the force due to gravity. If the wheel is strong enough to support your weight, it's strong enough to stand up to braking. The tire is going to skid long before the deceleration rate gets anywhere near the acceleration due to gravity. You put at least an order of magnitude greater force on a wheel riding through a pothole, than you ever will using your brakes. 

I foolishly did something similar and rode on just loose enough pedals long enough that they started orbiting and carved a nice wedge right out of the crank, destroying them. I suspect that is where you might be headed here. Get new cranks. Alas. 

I happen to think sandals are a bad idea. They provide next to no toe protection. I know people who have ridden in the winter with sandals and love them. (Goretex socks as outers for water protection and whatever you need inside for the temperature). But the problem is there is so much crap on the road, you never know when something will pop up hit your feet. This was funny as after reading about the guy with the Goretex socks, I tried my ride to work in sandals, and actually hit a bit of wrapping (The stuff the tie up stacks of wood or things on pallets with) that was on the ground, and whacked my toes pretty badly. The more I looked around as I rode on the street I realized there is way too much crap on the road for sandals to be a good idea. As zenbike said, to hop out for coffee, sure. But if you are going to do any road riding, it seems ill advised to me. 

FWIW, I have found allen wrenches that have a ball end to generally be of higher quality and less likely to round off. My experience is that generally the wrench fails long before the bolt. If the wrench gets rounded off, you need to stop using it ASAP. If you are doing lot's of your own bike work, it's worth investing in a set of T-handled allen wrenches. 

How do you get to Carnegie Hall? Practice, Practice, Practice. There is no magic bullet for dealing with this problem ( it's the same problem you'll have adjusting cones on a hub. ) Knowing just how loose to leave it so it's tightened correctly when you're done is something that comes with experience. This tweaking required to get it just right is one of the reasons threadless headsets were invented. They take far less labor and effort to install. One trick I've tried is to slightly overtighten and then use the lower wrench to tighten up against the locknut. Either way it helps if you keep pressure on both wrenches rather than trying to keep one still while tightening the other.
