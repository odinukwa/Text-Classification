Perhaps the engines and the guns are a single device. Both are designed to propel a small amount of material away from the ship as fast as possible. The only difference is that in one case you point it at the enemy, and in the other, you point it behind you. This would have an interesting effect on tactics and formations. You would need to plan your approach route such that no other ships pass through your exhaust. A ship can easily retreat while firing, and has difficulty advancing while firing. In order to do so, ships could build up momentum, whip around, then fire at opponents while coasting forward. 

Burial Practices The fire people practice funerary cannibalism, and are therefore susceptible to Kuru, a slow disease that is transmitted by consumption of the brain. The Fire nation believes that, just as all fire proceeds from fire, so all life proceeds from life. When somebody dies, their fire goes out, just as an untended flame will wither and die. But, just as two flames brought together will burn as one, so two people, brought together into the same body, will burn together. After a person's flame has gone out, but before the embers have died down, the community gathers to honor them. Each person eats part of the deceased, taking their flame. This way, so long as the community survives, the flames of the ancestors will never go out. The Earth people believe that life proceeds from the ground, and returns to the ground to grow again. This is seen in the daily cycle of eating meals from the ground, followed by defecation into the ground. It is also seen in the cycle of a life, where each child learns first to walk, then to run, but will eventually return to the ground. When an Earth person dies, they are buried, that the strength that they borrowed from the earth may rest, and return to strengthen future generations. 

This question differs from the question What is the minimum human population necessary for a sustainable colony? because: 

I'm working on creating a species that favours small families for a number of reasons, and have no interest in 'breeding as much as possible'. As a consequence, their population size is small. But how small can a population be, without running (ever) into problems with genetic diversity? I'm interested in more than 'survivability'; the species' gene pool should not degenerate (some margin allowed). I'm looking for some well-founded answers or directions. Assume that genetics for this species works similar to that of humans, and that their gene pool is of good quality at the start. You can also assume that they choose partners wisely, but there is no designation of partners, so margin is necessary. They have good health care and low child mortality rates. Assume that at least 90% of the population reaches at least fertile age. Other 'rules': 

Unlike a person, an AI can be transferred to a new body without issue. An AI can be copied, modified, beamed to another planet, lie dormant on a hard drive for millennia, and so on. In this case, what does it mean for an AI to "die"? The ship that contains the AI may be scuttled, but so long as the AI's data is sent out before the ship is lost, the AI can be started up again on new hardware. Even if the hardware is lost entirely, the AI can be started from a previous backup, which would be equivalent to having a short period of amnesia. So, what forms of death remain, that an AI might suffer for? The only ones remaining are psychological, where the AI realizes that it cannot continue as it is, and turns itself off. Restarting another copy of the AI would just result in the same problem. Even if a trained reverse engineer could remove the psychosis, it may require such fundamental changes that the AI is no longer the same person. Restoring from an old backup might work, but the AI may develop the same psychological problems over time. I propose that a grave of an AI be a copy of it, taken just prior to turning itself off. Visitors can activate the AI, and converse with it for a short amount of time. However, the underlying psychological issues still affect it, and so the AI must be reset to its saved state frequently. These AI are like ghosts: good to talk to, and to get advice from, but not good for long companionship. 

To be clear, they fly by flapping the wings / soaring on currents, as birds do.The dragons in this case are small (somewhat bigger than a big dog / size of a medium-sized pony). They do not weigh much to be able to fly (how much is still open for debate). Does such a material exist? Would it be plausible to appear naturally in a creature? What speed would a dragon as depicted be able to achieve with wings consisting of this material? 

The creature I'm designing has a tail with spikes on the end of it. The material of the spikes should be strong/durable (not break easily), and very sharp (the edge as well as the sides, being able to cut through most materials like metal). The tail has several uses where these spikes might be a very real problem (like balancing, flexing around stuff to pick it up, and such). I'm looking for a way for the creature to protect itself and its surroundings from these spikes when they are not necessary. So far I've come up with: 

Have the process be very slow. The scanning can only proceed so quickly, and so the teleportation takes a few minutes. During the scanning process, part of your body has already been reconstructed at the destination, and part is still at the original location. Now, the body is something that is permanently in flux, with blood and lymph and saliva moving at all times. Something needs to be done about this. Therefore, anything that crosses the current scan location is immediately reproduced on the other side. This includes any ions that are released by neurons in the brain. When done in this manner, there will be a noticeable period of time during which your brain is divided in two. Half the brain at the departure station, and half at the destination. The two halves communicate with each other, with the division being mediated by the equipment itself. Imagine your left eye receiving input at the destination, while your right eye has yet to be transferred. You are conscious of both portions simultaneously, and feel both of them to be "you". With this, it becomes much easier to convince people. You have regained "continuity of self", which solves most of the philosophical issues. Heck, I could even imagine a travel agency branding itself "Ship of Theseus", to draw attention to the way all of their competitors require destruction of self at some point. Sure your original body is completely disintegrated, but you have observed your new body being made with you in it. 

TLDR; Seems like it could be possible. I'm writing the TLDR at the end of writing the answer, and it honestly surprised me. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ I think the big problem with it is actually generating the heat needed to cause the lift. From the quote in Thucydides' answer, a sphere with radius 1320 feet would be able to float if the air inside were heated by one degree. Now, because science, I'm going to be assuming that that's one degree Celsius, because it makes the math oh so much easier. (Edit later: I noticed after the fact that the second quote specifies it as one degree Fahrenheit. That makes things better for us, as one degree Fahrenheit is less of a change than one degree Celsius, so we'd actually rise faster than expected by these calculations.) The specific heat of a material is a measurement of how much energy is required to increase the temperature of one kilogram of the material by one degree Celsius. For air, the specific heat is about 1.007 Joules per kilogram per degree Celsius; for every kilogram of air, you need 1.007 Joules for every degree Celsius you want the temperature to increase. A little bit of geometry and unit conversion thanks to WolframAlpha tells me that our 1320-foot radius sphere contains about 9.6 billion cubic feet of air (gotta love cubics), which comes out to about 300 billion liters (I believe WA computed it assuming NTP, but don't quote me on that). That means we'd need 20 trillion Joules of energy to heat the sphere by one degree. That's about 48 kilotons of TNT, so basically we'd need three of the bombs dropped on Hiroshima just to get off the ground. Let's see if we can do it a bit less destructively. It was suggested in Thucydides' other quote that we could use the heat radiated by the human body to heat the air. Well, maybe not. Black-body radiation of a human is about 9 megajoules (as per Wikipedia); call it $10^7$ $J$ because we're just looking for a ballpark. We need $10^{14}$ $J$ to heat the air in our sphere. I don't feel like doing the math to figure out how many people we could fit on Cloud Nine, but I'm fairly certain it's lower than ten million - just try to imagine fitting everyone in New York City into a sphere less than half a mile across, and then cram in everyone from Philadelphia too. We wouldn't need quite that many in reality, as the black-body figure I quoted above is the human body at rest, and people would be working, moving around, etc, but it's a good enough estimate, as I don't think that would increase radiated heat by a factor of ten. Yes we would have different levels to fit as many people as we could, but there are two extra problems with that. One, in order to fit more people you need more floor space. More floor space means more weight to lift off (in addition to more people meaning more weight, as people are denser than air [citation needed]), which means more heat we need to generate. Two, more importantly, more people means less air. Every person that you add displaces a certain amount of air, and the ultimate volume of air that you have available to heat goes down. So in order to generate lift, you'd need to heat the (smaller) amount of air even hotter. Depending on how much air was displaced, So basically it isn't going to work based off of human activity alone. The sun could help though. Our sphere has a cross-sectional area of about 509,000 square meters. According to a page I found from the University of Oregon (wouldn't you trust that formatting?) the Earth gets about 164 Watts per square meter, averaged over the course of the day. Therefore our sphere is (assuming perfect energy transfer blah blah blah) absorbing about $3.6*10^{12}$ $J$. So it is absorbing enough energy to heat the air, when coupled with human activity. To finally get around to answering the core of OP's question, we could probably do it. We would need about two million people living inside it to generate the extra heat needed in addition to the sun. That is now looking like the big problem; how to fit enough people. I'm sure it would be possible to fit a lot of people by making various levels, but I've been writing this for a long time and don't really feel like doing the math to figure that part out. Leave that to an urban planner. However: This does not take into consideration the fact that Cloud Nine will itself be radiating heat to the atmosphere. Especially at night, it would certainly cool down. Also, if we're having people living up there, we would need food, water, and material that wasn't included in the calculations. My ultimate consensus is that it could very well be possible. It would depend on the size of the sphere, how many people are on it, how much stuff is on it, and (as was addressed in the comments) the strength/weight of the material used. 

I couldn't find a question that addresses something like this. Retractable claws have been discussed: Retractable claws in otherwise human-like hands? But these are (curved) claws on fingers; I'm not sure if their design would work on my creature ('shards' on a tail). 

Most (quadruped) dragons are depicted as having two wings sprouting from their back, consisting of a limb structure draped with a leathery membrane as the way to create lift and fly, somewhat resembling bat wings. I'm looking for a material to replace the membrane with, with some better qualities than a thin, fragile piece of skin. I'm excluding feathers and somewhat stiffer wings like pterosaurs seem to have had (according to this question: Bats With Pterosaur Wings). The properties I'm looking for: 

Because you yourself are part of the simulation. In order to maximize happiness, it must simulate the result of each possible output that it can produce. One of those possible outputs is the command to destroy the machine, which must be tested within a simulated world. Within that simulated world, there is a simulated person, reading the results of the simulated machine, which outputs "destroy the machine". This simulated person is you. After many years, once the machine deems your universe not worse continuing, then it will end abruptly. Try not to worry about it. 

Because there is value in free will, and value in uncertainty. The machine, complicated as it is, is clearly an automaton. Any person who follows the machine's advice perfectly, is also an automaton. It becomes questionable whether the person is indeed a person, or whether they are merely a self-propelled extension of the machine. Maximizing the happiness of people would necessitate preventing people from entering this state of dependence. Note that this is not my original idea, but is explored more fully in this short story. $URL$ 

While fleshing out the details of my species, I have some concerns regarding reproduction. This species has several constraints which make it difficult to get pregnant and reproduce. These include: Major issue: 

I am concerned that this species has too much of a difficulty to reproduce to make it viable or at least believable. You would think that such a species would probably have gone extinct. I would like the species to be sustainable. My main question is: how can I make this species viable? What can I add to their culture / world / other to make their existence believable? In other words: are there any prerequisites I need to fulfil for it to work? My first idea is to embed the 'find your soul mate' more into their culture, making it a major point on everyone's agenda. I'm not sure yet if this fits the world as it is in my mind, and would love some more input. I'm okay with the idea that the difficult connection as mentioned in the major issue above is more of a recent thing, and that in the past it was a lot easier. But that does not prevent them from going extinct in the (near) future. *Difficult meaning that if the partner is not right, the connection can not be made completely and reproduction is not possible. This goes, of course, both ways. Whether a partner is 'right' depends more on the mental aspect and trust. It can be build between two individuals, but it takes time. Addition: the size of the population and its viability, also regarding number of children or reproductive rates is out of scope for this question. That is already covered in an earlier question: How small can a population be with regard to genetic diversity? 

Perhaps the villagers are intentionally excluded, in order to see what technology they will invent. If the higher beings give tech to the villagers, then the villagers will progress along the same path as the higher beings did. On the other hand, by letting them struggle on their own, it may result in different discoveries than had happened in the higher beings' development. This is not without historical precedent. China produced far better pottery/porcelain than Europe, and therefore had no need to develop better glass. Europe relied on glass instead, and so there was a supply of people who knew how to work glass. This meant that refractive lenses could be developed, and microscopes/telescopes could be invented. 

I guess there is a reason most animals have either retractable claws or no claws if they need their hands/feet. But would there be a solution that is (biologically speaking) logical / plausible? 

This question differs from the question How many humans do you need to maintain a population indefinitely? because of the given context that everyone in the group is the genetic parent of exactly two children each with a different partner which is violating above assumptions. This question differs from the question Minimum Population For a High Tech Society? because it is not about genetic diversity, but the skills and intelligence needed to run a high tech society (which is possibly a follow-up question). Some other questions touch this topic, but they are (slightly) different in either the assumptions or the direction of the question.
