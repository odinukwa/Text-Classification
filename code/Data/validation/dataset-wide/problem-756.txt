Neither of these seem correct to me. Could someone with real numbers weigh in on this? I seem to recall that seeing artefacts is only possible in the latest high-res images taken from lunar orbit, and the telescope that uses the reflector gets back single photons on some trials and is a much more powerful laser than you could buy! But, a continuous beam may be different? How big of a laser would you need to see a reflection with a viewing instrument that doesn't cost more than the laser? 

This is a great question and observation, and in fact it is not just distant events this applies to. When I look in the road and see my car parked outside, I should be thinking "it was outside", half a picosecond ago." I think it's just out of convenience that we use the present to describe all states as we perceive them now. But in actual fact we know nothing of "now" other than our own thoughts and feelings. All external stimulus is transmitted to us via various different media and through our senses, all of which take time to reach us, so if we are to be accurate, we never know anything about the present. 

You ask “someday will these moons collide with each other and be destroyed?” so the answer is yes, at least the inner group. So having 62 (a lot of them) is not the issue; the outer part is stable over billions of years. 

I know that normal planets don't get any larger than Jupiter (or 2 Jupiter radii if hot), as adding more gas just increases density, not radius, until you reach the point of being a brown dwarf star. That compressability, I suppose, is a property of the overall average material that forms star systems, as beyond a critical size it accretes the ambiant gas as well as dust in the cloud. That is, it's mostly hydrogen and a quarter helium with a bit of other stuff. But what about a body made of other stuff, such as rock or metal? Without worrying about planetary formation processes, just that atoms are piled together and feel self gravity. Perhaps it needs to be grown slowly so it has time to cool before adding more. Otherwise, no special techniques: just what would happen if material of suitable composition was heaped together? I suspect that normal ideas of minerals would not exist under that kind of pressure, even if carefully allowed to cool. But can elements other than H and He still compress their volume in the same way, or would a rocky world be able to reach sizes of millions of miles? What about more exotic cases, like the "puffy" planet I heard of that has the density of styrofoam? 

The flyby anomaly is an occasional, unpredictable, and as yet unexplained discrepancy in acceleration of satellites when they pass close by the Earth. It causes an increase of up to 13 mm/s during flybys but we have no understanding of it and how to predict it. The laws of centripetal force predict that due to rotation, the more dense molten material within the Earth might accumulate at the equator, since there it can move further from the axis of rotation. This will, of course be counteracted by gravity. Nevertherless, it will be an effect present at the equator more so than at the poles. This predicts that we should expect to see a flyby anomaly of some magnitude and that it will be correlated with proximity of a flyby to the equator. Can anybody provide anomaly data and / or correlate it with angle of incidence in order to test this hypothesis? 

I understand that a “large” moon, like ours, keeps the planet’s axis from being peturbed, because the spin axis and the moon’s orbital plane exchange momentum and tend to stay in the same plane, and the orbital angular momentum is much stronger because of the long lever arm. So, tipping the planet means changing the moon’s orbital plane too, and the peturbations don’t make a significant change to its large value. So, why is Pluto, along with the orbital plane of its satellites, tipped nearly 90 degrees? 

Well, Wikipedia says that it's 7.25°to the ecliptic and gives a reference. Looking there clarifies the value in 3 dimensions: 

Where we are, and in the conventional galaxies etc. that we see, there is a whole lot of relatively uniform space but in isolated places within that space, there are pockets of concentrated "mass" which is highly organised into all the objects we observe and study, and out of which we are made. Now suppose that there were regions of space where that is all turned on its head, and there were huge vast swathes of relatively uniform matter, and within that matter there are pockets of "space" which is highly organised into some other form of object, out of which other objects and beings are made. Obviously on the first, and simplest test - the question of "how much" dark matter there is, this theory passes the empirical test of reality with flying colours, i.e. astronomers seem to observe much more mass in the regions of hypothesised dark matter in accordance with what this conjecture implies. What other testable predictions does this conjecture make, and how well do they fit our observations? 

You need an Orrery. Specifically, one that includes Earth’s rotation. My noting the meridian on the model Earth, you can see how the Earth may be rotated some amount each time the Moon passes on a line between the Earth and Sun. The wikipedia page gives a formula. Take the result (given in UT) and apply the timezone offset for the desired longitude. The same page discusses Lunar calindars and may have the info you are really interested in. 

Since those coordinates are relative to the Earth’s axis, being a practical measurement system for Earth ground observers to use in pointing their telescopes, you need to combine that with Earth's orbit. As a useful visualization, mark that point on a model of the celesial sphere. Compare that with the ecliptic pole: the difference between thise points is what you want to know. I expect you’ll find they are separated by 7.25°, but by marking a model sphere you’ll understand the actual direction. 

Whenever I see the term dust for the particles of a nebula, I ask myself whether this is actually based on some reliable measure of particle size. Of course we can all agree it looks like dust from this distance. And we all know how such appearances often lead to assumptions which are incorrect and whose incorrectness we are often blind to. Is there any reliable evidence by which this "dust" is known not to be pebbles, rocks, boulders etc.? Which in reality would seem vastly more likely. How might we measure size from such distances? 

The expansion is overridden on a small scale by gravity. Our galaxy is not expanding, and the stars are bound together. In fact, a whole group of galaxies don't notice the overall expansion. 

That's an interesting way to put it. Indeed, since bodies spend most of their time at the slow end of an eccentric orbit, the extended lobes will attract each other, torquing the orbits into a birdsnest shape. See this presentation by Dr. Madigan. I'm really disappointed that the more scientifically literate press (like SciAm) doesn't cover this idea, but hypes the large distant bodies idea. (See slide at 15:58 in the video. But, it's the explaination up to that point that describes the mechanism.) In short, the particular clustering of orbit shapes and orientations can be explained through self-interaction of the long-term averages of the bodies' orbits: the apahelion acts as a "virtual object", as you put it, and attract each other.
