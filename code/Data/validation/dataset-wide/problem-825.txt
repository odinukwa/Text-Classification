Stars do not get hot because of nuclear fusion, they become hot enough to sustain nuclear fusion and this process maintains their temperatures. Nuclear fusion actually stops a star getting hotter. Protostars (before nuclear fusion) get hot because of a well known statistical relationship between the gravitational potential energy of a gas and the internal kinetic energy of the particles that make up the gas. [In an ideal gas, the kinetic energy of the particles is directly proportional to the temperature of the gas.] This is known as the virial theorem, which says that twice the summed kinetic energy of particles ($K$) plus the gravitational potential energy ($\Omega$, which is a negative quantity for a bound object) equals zero. $$ 2K + \Omega = 0$$ Now you can write down the total energy of the system as $$ E_{tot} = K + \Omega$$ and hence from the virial theorem that $$E_{tot} = \frac{\Omega}{2},$$ which is also negative. If we now remove energy from the system, for instance by allowing the gas to radiate away energy, such that $\Delta E_{tot}$ is negative, then we see that $$\Delta E_{tot} = \frac{1}{2} \Delta \Omega$$ So $\Omega$ becomes more negative - which is another way of saying that the protostar attains a more collapsed configuration. Oddly, at the same time, we can use the virial theorem to see that $$ \Delta K = -\frac{1}{2} \Delta \Omega = -\Delta E_{tot}$$ is positive. i.e. the kinetic energies of particles in the gas (and hence their temperatures) actually become hotter. In other words, the gas has a negative heat capacity. But a hotter temperature usually means more radiation is produced and if the energy losses continue, then so does the collapse. This process is ultimately arrested in a star by the onset of nuclear fusion. This replaces the radiative losses with nuclear energy and the star attains a quasi-equilibrium that lasts as long as it has nuclear fuel to burn. 

The answer is yes. The mass (and hence brightness) of meteorites follows some sort of power-law relationship such that there are many more small particles than big lumps of rock. This means that there are indeed many more faint meteorites than bright ones, though I am struggling to find any detailed study that goes below the magnitude range you can see with the naked eye. This paper by Kresakova (1966) seems thorough and representative. It suggests that the number of meteorites goes up by a factor of 3 for each unit increase in astronomical magnitude (i.e. decreasing brightness). The paper referred to by Barry Carter in his comments is Cook et al. (1980), which finds that log of the cumulative number of meteors is proportional to about half the astronomical magnitude. i.e. $$\frac{d \log \phi}{dm} \simeq 0.5 $$ This means that the number of meteorites increases by a factor of $10^{0.5}$ for each unit increase in magnitude - i.e. also about 3. It is a separate issue as to whether you see more with night vision goggles on. I guess you would because these would have light amplification properties that would enable you to see fainter objects - that's the whole point of them. 

The expansion of the Universe can be expressed using Hubble's law. This is that the recession velocity that a galaxy has with respect to our own is proportional to its distance from us. i.e. $$ v = H_0 D, $$ where $v$ is the recession velocity, $D$ is the distance and H_0 is the Hubble "constant", which has a value of about 70 km/s per Megaparcsec. Hubble's law is attributed tot he overall expansion of the universe and means that once we get further away than about 10 Mpc (or about 30 million light years), that other galaxies recede from us with velocities of 700 km/s or more. This recession produces a redshift. However, superimposed on Hubble's law at a more local scale, individual galaxies are gravitationally interacting with each other and hence have their own peculiar motions with respect to the general "Hubble flow". In addition, don't forget our Sun rotates around the centre of our Galaxy with a velocity of some 230 km/s, so is heading in the direction of some galaxies and away from others. These local peculiar motions means that some nearby galaxies are moving towards us (at relatively modest speeds) and do exhibit a blue shift. An example would be the Andromeda galaxy at 2 million light years, which is approaching our Galaxy at about 110 km/s (or at a relative closing speed of 300 km/s with respect to the Sun). But there are only about 50 galaxies in our local group and a further few tens of galaxies in some other structures out to about 30 million light years, and it is only from this small sample that any can exhibit blueshifts. The vast majority of known galaxies are further way and are swept along in the general universal expansion and hence away from us. 

Perhaps one way of answering this is to note that the (approximately) dipole magnetic fields of a magnetar fall off radially as something like $r^{-3}$. So at the magnetar surface the fields could be of order $10^{11}$ Teslas (at a maximum), but these are reduced by a factor of $\sim 8$ at 2 magnetar radii, a factor of $\sim 27$ at 3 magnetar radii etc. Now given that the radius of a magnetar is going to be $\sim 10$ km, then the fields die away pretty quickly. So let's say the Earth orbited a magnetar. The field strength at $1.5 \times 10^{11}$ m is going to be $\sim 10^{11} \times (10^4/1.5\times10^{11})^3 = 3 \times 10^{-11}$ Teslas - much smaller than the Earth's magnetic field. To put this in context. The field at the surface of a small neodymium magnet are of order 1 Tesla and they don't disrupt your atoms when you pick them them up. To get a field this strong from a magnetar you would have to get to within about 50,000 km of it. The synchrotron radiation field would have fried you before then and any planet would have been ripped apart by tidal forces about an order of magnitude further away. The Roche limit given by $$ R_{Roche} \sim 1.26 R_1 \left(\frac{\rho_1}{\rho_2}\right)^{1/3},$$ where $\rho_1$ is the density of the neutron star ($\sim 3 \times 10^{17}$ kg/m$^{3}$), $\rho_2$ is the density of the Earth ($\sim 5500$ kg/m$^3$) and $R_1$ is the radius of the neutron star (10 km). This yields $R_{roche} = 480,000$ km. 

According to the observer holding the rope, the camera would never make it past the event horizon. It would appear to slow down to a standstill just above the horizon (though would effectively disappear because of redshift). At some point the rope would snap, but the camera would still not appear to cross the horizon. According to an observer with the camera, they would cross the horizon. But if they were lowered slowly, the rope would snap before they got there, since infinite force is needed to "hover" just above the event horizon. They would then find themselves inexorably falling inwards in the same way that you and I are inexorably drawn into the future and can't revisit the past. That different observers in different frames have different versions of events is not unusual in relativity. 

I'm afraid the only correct answer to this question is that nobody knows. Cosmology is based on a number of simplifying assumptions (sometimes called principles) - the most basic of which is that the universe is "isotropic and homogeneous on large scales". Isotropic means that is (or looks) the same in any direction; homogeneous means that what we see does not depend on our position in the universe. This "cosmological principle" is reasonably well tested and would certainly make sense if the universe were very much bigger than we are capable of seeing. The most distant thing we can "see" in our universe is the cosmic microwave background (CMB), the light of which has been travelling for about 13.6 billion years. However, if we were to think about a parcel of gas that emitted the CMB and where it is now, we could calcuate that it is about 46 billion light years away due to the expansion of space in the universe. Thus the "edge of the observable universe" is about 46 billion light years. What we can say, is that on these scales the Universe is very isotropic, and homogeneous, because the CMB is very smooth and looks the same in all directions to a very good approximation (but see below). This suggests that if you were to travel 46 billion light years in any direction, that you would probably have a very similar view to what we have now (that is, if you were able to miraculously travel instantaneously; if you travelled more slowly then of course the universe would continue to get older). You are talking about travelling more than a factor 10000 further. On these scales we do not know anything outside of speculation. The inflationary model for the big bang might suggest that our observable universe is just a tiny part of a much greater entity and that within this very much larger entity everything will be homogeneous and isotropic at a given cosmic time. However, the recent very precise Planck measurements of the CMB, suggest there may be small, but real, anisotropies on scales as big as the observable universe, which would then suggest that any extrapolation by a factor of 10000 might be wishful thinking. 

Best answer is that we don't know. The techniques that are used for finding exoplanets are incomplete - that is they are capable of finding planets around stars in some circumstances but not in others. For example, finding stars using the transit detection technique is more sensitive to planets that are (i) big, (ii) close to their parent star and (iii) orbiting their star with an edge-on orientation from our point of view. The doppler techniques are sensitive to (i) massive exoplanets, (ii) those that are close-in to their parent star, (iii) favour detection when the line of sight lies close to the orbital plane. Each detection method (and each observing strategy and telescope/satellite) has their own particular selection bias, but overall the picture is that the census of exoplanets is more complete for close-in massive planets, and very incomplete for planets that are either small or orbiting with periods much longer than 10 years. Then at very large separations and very long orbital periods (think 100s of years), direct imaging surveys are again capable of spotting massive exoplanets. Microlensing observations are also capable of detecting even small planets at large distances from their star. The result of all this is that any figure for the observed fraction of stars with exoplanets or the number of exoplanets per star is a lower limit. The exception is where researchers try to account for the various selection effects and give a figure for the fraction of stars with certain types of planet in certain types of orbit around certain types of star. At the moment it looks like the modal number of exoplanets per star is at least 1. In other words it seems increasingly likely that most stars have exoplanets of one sort or another. Some facts and figures. From Kepler transit data, Petigura et al. (2013) say that 22% of Sun-like stars have "Earth-sized" planets orbiting in their habitable zone (my italics), but their plots show that the overall results for planets with orbital periods in the range 5-100 days (where Kepler is most sensitive), are that nearly 60% of stars have planets from Earth- to Jupiter- sized in this range. Cassan et al. (2012) use microlensing survey data to claim that 17% of stars have "Jupiters" at 0.5-10 au from their parent star, and that Neptune-sized or "super-Earth" sized objects orbit a further (approximately) 50% and 60% respectively. The combination of these figures also suggests multiple planets are not rare and indeed the title of their paper is "One or more bound planets per Milky Way star from microlensing observations". The frequency of multiple planet systems is also hard to assess. All the techniques are capable of detecting certain types of multiple system, but equally all are capable of missing multiple planets even when they are there. Kepler did detect many multiple transiting systems, so they are not rare. A study by Tremain & Dong (2012) estimated a minimum fraction of 20-30% of stars that have one transiting planet will also have others. This is on top of the 15% of Kepler planetary systems where multiple planets can be directly observed (i.e where the orbital planes are very close together). 

I'm not familiar with the design of the ProjectBlue telescope, but I think you have answered your own question. The habitable zones for Alpha Cen A and B, are approximately centred at 1.25au and 0.7au. Both are at a distance of 4.37 light years. 1au at 4.37 light years, subtends an angle of 0.74 arcseconds. If working at blue wavelengths (the aim appears to be to find a pale blue dot, so let's say 400nm), an Airy disk of 0.74 arcsec is achieved with a telescope with a diameter of just 13cm. To stand a chance of resolving planets in the habitable zone, you would need a telescope a little bigger than this. However, a bigger problem is separating the signal from the star and planets when they are barely resolved. The Airy disc is just the first minimum in the diffraction pattern. If the star is around 10 billion times as bright as the planet (ball park figure) then it would still swamp a planet that was just resolved. Thus you need to build a bigger telescope to increase the angular resolution. And you need to build superb optics and a coronagraph to stop the light from the star swamping your detector. But this costs more money, the telescope has more mass, needs a bigger launch vehicle etc. So I guess a 50cm telescope is their compromise. Is it achievable? I don't know. The best telescopes on Earth achieve almost diffraction-limited angular resolution using adaptive optics. However the contrast they can obtain for exoplanet imaging is compromised by the atmosphere to some extent. If you are looking for a "pale blue dot", then this can't be done from the ground because adaptive optics systems do not currently work at such wavelengths. It is quite possible that Earth-like planets in the habitable zone of Alpha Cen could be discovered from the ground in the next few years using improved radial velocity measurements, but not by imaging. An interesting question is why this can't be done now with HST? The proposed telescope will spend two years doing this. Even if HST could cut this to months, I am not convinced that detecting a faint smudge around the nearest star has the necessary science pay off to get the time, especially as there is a fair chance of failure. There may not be planets in the habitable zone or there may be sufficient zodiacal dust in the system to make the measurements impossible due to scattered light. Further research suggests that the coronagraph on the HST ACS camera would only give around 7-8 magnitudes (factors of a thousand) contrast at angular separations of an arcsecond. So nowhere near what is required. This new telescope must have radically improved optics and a more advanced coronagraph. 

Gravitational contraction will always release gravitational potential energy. In most systems, where this happens slowly, you can apply the virial theorem to say that half the released energy is radiated and half is used to heat the contracting gas. The real question is whether the release of gravitational PE is significant compared with other sources. In most stars it is not. Nuclear fusion is responsible for extending their lives way beyond the Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale - the amount of GPE divided by their luminosity. In some stars GPE is hardly released at all though. The capability to contract depends on the behaviour of gas's pressure as a function of temperature. If pressure is independent of temperature then no contraction of an object is possible even as it radiates away its energy and even if it has no other energy sources. This is the case for white dwarfs supported by electron degeneracy pressure. They cannot contract further and will simply cool down at constant radius. Jupiter is an interesting intermediate case. Yes it is contracting, but not at the rate you would expect for a perfect gas. Eventually, its contraction will slow right down and it will just cool. 

Yet another example would be dwarf spheroidal galaxies, these are relatively small galaxies that are nevertheless almost totally dominated by dark matter - they have mass-to-light ratios of $\sim$1000, compared with a "normal" galaxy, where this ratio might be $\sim$ 10. There are also examples of dark galaxies. These may not be galaxies made of non-baryonic dark matter, but dark matter in the sense that for whatever reason, these galaxies do not contain many bright stars. Thus although they may be massive, they do not emit much light and contain a lot of "inert", non-starforming gas. 

In a white dwarf, the dense matter is not in its lowest energy configuration. Energy can still be extracted from the white dwarf material by fusion, provided it can be ignited. What exothermic nuclear reactions would there be that could take place in a neutron star? The bulk of the material is in the form of neutrons with a small number of protons and electrons. At these densities, that is the most stable equilibrium composition. If a neutron star gains mass in a gradual way, then the most likely course of events will be that its radius will decrease (that is what happens in objects supported by degenerate matter) until it reaches a General Relativistic instability where its collapse to a black hole is inevitable (when $R$ is somewhere between 1.25 and 2 times the Schwarzschild radius). It is possible that neutrons may transform before that into additional hadronic degrees of freedom or into quark matter, but these are endothermic processes that suck kinetic energy out of the neutron gas and only hasten the collapse.
