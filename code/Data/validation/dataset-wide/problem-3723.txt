This is a comment but I do not belong to the happy few who have this privilege. The exponential function (even with real arguments) is a Schwartzian distribution. The purpose of this comment is to document the fact that Schwartz showed that the Fourier transform can be extended to the space of ALL distributions (not just tempered ones as is in his seminal text) in 1952 (consult Wikipedia under Paley-Wiener theorem, in particular, Schwartzian Paley-Wiener theorem): His method establishes an isomorphism between the space of distributions on the line and a certain space of entire functions subject to suitable growth conditions. (The precise details can be found in accessible form in Strichartz' book on Fourier transforms and distributions). This allows a completely rigorous derivation of the above formula for the FT of such functions. The easiest way to do this is to use the usual trick of first calculating the FT of the Dirac function (with complex singularity---there is no mystery about this---the Dirac "function" is a measure and so can be defined at any point even in a topological space) which follows immediately from the latter's filtering property. One then uses the fact (which is valid also in this context) that the FT is its own inverse (modulo the usual games with constants). I don't have the resources to check whether the Schwartz approach predates that of Gelfand and Silov mentioned above. 

As an introductory remark, there has been a considerable amount of work done on topologies on spaces of operators in Hilbert spaces, in particular with regard to their relevance to the theory of von Neumann algebras. In my opinion there are two essential criteria which one should apply: the topology should be complete and its dual should be a natural space of operators. The compact open topology fails the second one---its dual is the space of finite rank operators. (Incidentally, the most immediate natural candidate, the norm topology, also passes the first one but fails the second---in this case, the dusl is too large). Further candidates (which have already been mentioned)---the weak, strong, ultraweak and ultrastrong topologes---also fail this test. A suitable family of natural topologies which pass both tests with flying colours (whereby the dual spaces are the space of nuclear operators) was introduced 40 years ago in the Comptes Rendues paper "Topologies dans l'espace des operateurs sur les espaces de Hilbert" (1973). These are the finest locally convex topologies which agree with the topology of compact convergence on the unit ball. (There are four, since we can consider convergence with resepct to the weak or strong topologies and also their symmetric versions, i.e., ones for which the operation of taking adjoints is continuous). Some of their basic properties can be found in the above article. This shows that the answer to your question is pretty well always no and goes on to answer the (implicit?) continuation---what is the "correct" topology on $B(H)$? 

Suppose $\kappa$ is a no-where vanishing 1-form, then its kernel is integrable is equivalent to condition $d\kappa \wedge \kappa = 0$. My question is, can such foliation smoothly deformed such that actually $d\kappa = 0$? EDIT: Smooth means real $C^\infty$, and I want the $\kappa$ to be nowhere-vanishing along the deformation. Thanks Loïc Teyssier pointing out the lack of context. Thank you. 

My goal to write down an explicit (and simplest) contact metric structure on squashed $S_\omega^{2n + 1}$ defined as \begin{equation} S_\omega ^{2n + 1} = \left\{ {\left( {{z_i}} \right) \in \mathbb{C}^{n + 1}\;\;|\sum\limits_{i = 1}^{n + 1} {\omega _i^2{{\left| {{z_i}} \right|}^2} = 1} } \right\} \end{equation} For the contact 1-form I would use the natural one restricted on $S^{2n+1}_\omega$ \begin{equation} \kappa \equiv \frac{i}{2}\sum\limits_{i = 1} {\left( {{z_i}d{{\bar z}_i} - {{\bar z}_i}d{z_i}} \right)} \end{equation} Take $n = 2$ as example, I use parametrization \begin{equation} \left\{ \begin{gathered} {z_1} = \omega _1^{ - 1}\sin {\rho _1}\cos {\rho _2}{e^{i{\varphi _1}}} \\ {z_2} = \omega _2^{ - 1}\sin {\rho _1}\sin {\rho _2}{e^{i{\varphi _2}}} \\ {z_3} = \omega _3^{ - 1}\cos {\rho _1}{e^{i{\varphi _3}}} \\ \end{gathered} \right. \end{equation} and if I am calculating correctly, the Reeb vector field will be \begin{equation} R = \sum\limits_i {\omega _i^2{\partial _{{\varphi _i}}}} \end{equation} which generates rotation $\left( {{z_1},{z_2},{z_2}} \right) \to \left( {{e^{i\omega _1^2\theta }}{z_1},{e^{i\omega _2^2\theta }}{z_2},{e^{i\omega _3^2\theta }}{z_2}} \right)$ (Since that $\kappa \sim zd\bar z$ has $\omega_i^{-2}$ coefficients, so $R$ will need $\omega_i^{2}$ to kill these ugly coefficients and leave some $\sin$ and $\cos$ so that $\iota_R \kappa$ to add up to 1). 

I am considering the following situation. Let $M_5$ be a 5-dimensional manifold which is an $S^1$ principal bundle over 4-manifold $M_4$. For instance, $M_5 = S^5$ and $M_4 = \mathbb{CP}^2$ with standard Hopf fibration.Now there is a principal G-bundle (or associated bundle $adP$) over $M_5$. My question is, how to characterize $P$ over $M_5$, and is there a canonical induced bundle over $M_4$? Let me explain my question a little bit. I know that, for even dimensional manifold $X$, characteristic numbers (integrating over $X$ the characteristic class built up by curvature) can efficiently characterize principal. But in odd dimensional cases, I'm not sure how to do similar thing. One thing I can imagine is to integrate characteristic classes over all even-dimensional cycles. Secondly, suppose there is a way to characterize $P\to M_5$. Then I would like to know if there is a natural principal induced bundle $P'$ over $M_4$, and how to use the data of $P\to M_5$ to describe the induced bundle $P' \to M_4$. If possible, we can take some simple cases. Say, the Hopf fibration. Principal $G$-bundles over $S^5$ are characterized by $\pi_4G$, and they are $0$ or $\mathbb{Z}_2$, as I check a list of homotopy group for Lie groups. If I take trivial $G$-bundle over $S^5$, do I get a trivial bundle over $\mathbb{CP}^2$ (do I get new "twist" in the process of inducing bundle)? And what about other situation? Thanks. 

Let $X$ be a compact smooth manifold that admits symplectic and Kaehler structures. There is a paper by Ugarte, Rudyak, Tralle, and Ibanez, showing how the Lefschetz rank can vary along a path of symplectic forms on $X$. Using this, one can interpolate between Hard Lefschetz symplectic forms and just plain symplectic forms. There is also a paper by Draghici that constructs on $4$-manifolds a path of cohomology classes that starts in the Kaehler cone and then definitely leaves it. However, I am having trouble finding results in the literature that would help me to start with a Hard Lefschetz symplectic form and then somehow interpolate from that to a Kaehler form. Do people have any experience with this question? Or know some good resources for further reading on this topic? Perhaps I am not framing my question in a good way? Maybe relinquishing control of the Kaehler structures and attempting to reach them (instead of starting with them) is a little bit too intractable? 

It is known in Li's paper ($URL$ that in compact symplectic manifolds $(X^{2n},\omega)$ of dimension at least $2n\geq 4$, an immersed symplectic surface represents a $2$-homology class as long as that homology class has positive symplectic area. When $2n\geq 6$, this immersion may even be taken to be an embedding. My question regards finding symplectically embedded submanifolds $(M^{2d},\sigma)$ which are themselves of dimension $2d\geq 4$. Does anybody here know of any progress on this front? I have not found it yet, and I'm not optimistic that it exists in great abundance, if at all. 

The symplectic blow-up of a compact symplectic manifold $(X,ω)$ along a compact symplectically embedded submanifold $(M,σ)$ results in another compact manifold $(\tilde{X},\tilde{ω})$ given by $$\tilde{X}=\overline{X−V}∪φ\tilde{V}$$ where $V$ is a tubular neighborhood of $M$ that is diffeomorphic via $φ$ to $\tilde{V}$ and lives away from the zero section in the canonical line bundle over the projectivization of the normal bundle of $M$ in $X$. The blow-down map $f:\tilde{X}→X$ restricts to a diffeomorphism in $X−V$, so in general, if my understanding is correct, $\tilde{X}$ may not be realized as a fibre bundle over $X$. Indeed, the cohomology algebra for $\tilde{X}$, as shown by McDuff, is a direct sum of the cohomology for $X$ with a finitely generated module over the cohomology of $M$. The Leray-Hirsch theorem gives a tensor product result for the cohomology of fibre bundles and product spaces. My question is, is it known what circumstances precipitate the symplectic blow-up $\tilde{X}$ to be at least homotopically equivalent to a fibre bundle over $X$? Or is this nonsense?
