If you were in the States, I'd say it's still open season until you received an offer letter. A verbal offer (and even an acceptance) is nothing. You could show up on day one (without having received an offer letter) and discover that the salary being paid isn't what you were told by phone; in the US, there's not much recourse in such a situation besides quitting. You could tell company A that you're not in a position to make a commitment without a written offer letter. But I don't know your culture, so I cannot assume that doing so would not backfire. If the company was okay with working toward producing a written offer letter, it might buy you a little time. 

Adam, you're not obligated to explain anything to your boss. It's sounding as if attempting to do so may cause you more personal distress than you really want to cope with. People leave jobs every day for no shortage of reasons, so this isn't a unique situation. If you're really going to do it, get focused on finding your next opportunity. But this time, ask the right questions before you change jobs, so you don't jump out of the frying pan and into the fire. Examine your offers carefully, and pick the right one for you. When you get your written offer letter, turn in your resignation and get on with your life. Again, don't worry about your boss. Your boss will get over it. You're not doing anything wrong by keeping your mouth shut on reasons you're leaving. 

If you read carefully, you'll notice how none of these three things requires in-depth technical knowledge from the PM. I think you're expecting too much. If a PM had your technical expertise, why would a PM stay a PM? Think about it. 

It's not rude. But you have to be very diplomatic about it. You have to be very, very careful who you ask. Don't let anyone be able to label you as a complainer. Be solution-oriented. As for the blame game - if it's with machine settings, doing a little cover-your-behind will work in the short term. When you finish working with a device, snap a picture of the controls or settings with your phone (I'm assuming). When the fingers are pointed at you, pull out your phone. This is only a short term strategy though - if the company just has a blaming type culture, then you need to get out of there if that doesn't work for you. 

The only "handling" that you're going to be able to do is with yourself. I've been in the same situation as you for a while with a peer. Let's call him Ted. Ted and I have the same title. In the time I've been around, I've had few shortages of work, but Ted has had a major shortage of work. Management is aware (and there's nothing I can do). When Ted gets an assignment, Ted trips up on basic, basic tasks, and his solution is to annoy everyone else until someone helps him solve his issue. At times, when others ask about the status of his work, he's thrown my name in the middle of things. That's a BIG issue for me, because I don't report to him!! Then when the work's done, Ted goes back to his pattern of web surfing most of the day. He really hasn't taken advantage of all that free time to actually learn how to do the job when duty calls. So when the time comes to put his nose to the grindstone, he panics. I say, "not my circus, not my monkeys!" My approach is that if Ted's asking me info that only is available in our environment, I'm glad to help. But MOST of the time Ted is asking me for anything, my response is "GOOGLE!" I've even had to spell this out in writing via e-mail, and even CC'd this to the boss. You have to be firm with your boundaries, or people like Ted will wear you out with their neediness. 

This is highly, highly unreasonable. As the other comments have said, the project's really not going to go very far. On the other side, you need to consider yourself in this setting. So you're going to go from working 8 hrs a day to 12? Five days a week? When will you have time to sleep? This time doesn't include whatever time you already spend commuting, either. I had a co-worker who was going through something like this in her department. She had a 3-mile drive to get home, but during such a period of unusually heavy overtime, she fell asleep at the wheel driving home one day. She cracked a few ribs, and totaled the car. Your situation may not go this extreme, but your body will pay for it. Is it worth it? Ask around. If 55 to 60 hour weeks are the norm, start looking for your next job. 

If these are people you wish to stay in contact with, it's not your employer's responsibility to help you maintain those connections because they are YOUR personal connections. Truth be told, the employer could just as well delete your business e-mail account instead of having it forward to someone else's inbox, and there's not a single thing you can do about it. Here's another way to look at this: if you change phone numbers (at least, with a land line), a phone company doesn't provide a "forwarding" message indefinitely, unless you're paying for them to not re-use that old telephone number. Just like with your employer - they're not obligated. 

Nobody's going to seriously believe that you've become expert at all those roles. Did you do them? Yes. Did you do them all for eight hours a day? No. For example, if your main track is development, it would be foolish (and a waste of time) to apply for a QA job as an "expert". Your employability isn't being damaged per se. But your morale will take a dive the longer you stay in that position carrying such a heavy load by yourself. Doing things like platform upgrades on major systems will prove more and more difficult over time because you're the only one doing the work. It's in your interests, long term, to get into a position where there's a cleaner division of work -- because someday, you WILL need a vacation where you're not being called to fix production issues (as nobody else can). Take care of "you". 

Sometimes there are counseling programs that an employer can put in place to help employees during crisis periods at home. Access to these types of programs is free to the employee, and a great resource to getting everybody involved to the next phase. It'd be real dumb to think that nobody on a job is ever going to have lapses due to birth, death, divorce, alcohol / drug use, medical emergencies, and so forth. This guy on the job might just lack coping skills or access to information. He's a blue-collar worker, and the pay alone might preclude his field of vision to options that are available. Or, he might not see options because in many instances, they're labelled "For women and children". It might be as simple as pointing his nose in a different direction, rather than coming down on him as inept. If you fire him without some intercession, it's going to send an ugly message to the other workers that they have to have their lives together 100% of the time.. which actually makes the workplace more stressful than it already is. At least try. He might need a "coach" - someone more available than the "boss" or HR, and more impartial. 

I've got some anxiety-related challenges of my own, so I get it. Re-phrase "anxiety" to "personal life challenges". Keep it vague, on purpose. If it comes up in conversation, steer away from the details with your anxiety and keep the focus on how it's made you a better person, how you've grown, and what you learned as a result. Paint yourself as empowered by the experience (I hope this would be a true statement). 

Nicholas, you are a remote worker and an intern. How that came about, I can't say. But you're not going to be placed on the critical path for any serious work if the situation stays as-is, because there's no real opportunity for you to showcase your work or your work habits. If you disappeared today, your post seems to indicate that they wouldn't miss your efforts at all. I'd suggest that you figure out a way to get yourself included in as many Skype meetings as possible, to help the effort of associating your name and face as someone who's ready, willing, and able to get work done. The payoff for your boss has to be higher than the burden of communicating everything to you either by e-mail or by needing to schedule phone calls; otherwise, you're going to continue to be sidelined. If you can arrange it, show up in the office once a week. I think it'd help. 

I'm not going to label you with the word wrong, as you put it. First, I assume that you know that you can't force your boss or anyone else to do or feel anything. Now - if you hang it out there that your boss SHOULD be grateful (your own internal value), and your boss does not express said gratitude, then you have set yourself up for disappointment - depression, frustration, or anger. If you modify (downgrade) your value from "he should be grateful" to "it'd be nice if he were grateful, but I understand that he doesn't have to be", then this is more in tune with reality, and it won't sting so much. Try taking those "should" statements out of your vocabulary, because every "should" that you emit implicitly toward someone else says it's okay for others to do the same to you. Best of luck. 

"An employer is not required to pay a minimum number of hours to its hourly paid employees or to its non-exempt salary employees including if they are called back in. An employer only has to pay its hourly employees and non-exempt salary employees for the actual hours worked regardless of how long or how few the time is." Source: $URL$ 

There's nothing unprofessional about an e-mail resignation. While this is obviously someone you respect, in a professional sense, you don't owe her or anyone else any explanation. If you got fired or laid off by the organization, she couldn't change that, nor vice versa. You have met a professional courtesy (there's no legal requirement, in most situations in the US) to supply a written resignation and there's no need to be apologetic about taking care of business. 

Pull your boss into this. The other developers aren't budging, and it could be for many reasons. Maybe you intimidate them (but if that's the case, they'd be intimidated by any junior developer at this point). The reasons are not really your concern - that's for your boss to take up. The behavior, on the other hand, is also for your boss to take up. Share your concerns with your boss. Mention the e-mails you've sent with no response, and ask the boss if it'd be prudent for you to CC or BCC him/her on these e-mails you're describing. This leaves a paper trail. After so much of this, and you're not getting the assistance you need, your boss will have something tangible by which to take some action. When that occurs, watch out! But believe it or not, this is easier than you trying to confront the developers directly. 

Balance your zeal for proving yourself with the willingness to ask "why" (and sometimes, to leave things as they are). There is going to be plenty of stuff going on that your professors never taught you (and possibly never knew), and that you can only begin to understand by having to deal with under real-world constraints like time, money, and office politics. 

If you have the feeling that he's being disturbed, why do you persist in sending another email? It's okay to start your e-mail however you like, but the net effect of every additional e-mail you send is that you are labeling yourself as a nuisance. Let's think this through. Four e-mails on the same subject, in rapid-fire succession to the same person, shows that you might just believe said person has nothing better to do with herself / himself than attend to your needs. In your case, it's at a distance. If you're demonstrating that kind of behavior now, what perception would the receiver get on how you'd behave if you were hired? If I were the Assistant General Manager, I'd think, "what a jerk!" I'd recommend backing off and pursuing other opportunities. 

Log in Clean up any personal files or installed programs, but leave any company related material as is. You can actually leave Chrome as-is. Create a NEW admin user. Give the company THAT user name and password. Do NOT give your Google and MS account information. 

If you're the lead, then you are in the position to ask this other person to stand aside because part of a lead's duty is to facilitate a productive work environment for the team. It's a loss of productivity for your team to need to give status to two separate people, and furthermore a loss of productivity for your boss to receive two team status reports for the same team that are never going to agree 100%. You're on the right track. You're not doing anything wrong. Now it's time to ask the unwanted helper to fall back. 

Notwithstanding some gross negligence taking place on the part of the developers, absolutely not. The client pays. Bug fixing is a normal component of any development cycle, along with QA efforts to flush bugs out. Don't fall for it. 

Why would she say this, if she felt that the two of you had reached an accord on present business? It seems you are jumping to conclusions without actually hearing the concerns. 

This could very well be indicative of a subculture within the company that the high-level execs are unaware of, or ignoring. I am going to assume that you might have the (typical?) olive-toned skin, dark hair, surname, or accent of someone from the Middle East, by what you've shared. Please note that I'm absolutely not trying to be derogatory -- but parts of Europe seem to be hotbeds where looking or sounding like that can be a "trigger" in certain people. If you looked or sounded a different way, those questions probably would have never come up. You may be walking into a mess where the conflict has nothing to do with your job, but your being thrown into a category. If that's company culture, it might be extremely difficult to cope with or change. Maybe you should meet some more of your future co-workers and assess. If you get a premonition, listen to it! 

Instead of acquiescing to only what your boss wants to discuss in your one-on-one, schedule a different meeting with career and promotion as the topic. Before you go, prepare a written agenda and attach it to the meeting request. This way, the thing you're looking to discuss is completely obvious BEFORE you show up to the meeting. If you think you'll get push-back, you might just want to include your boss's boss in the meeting. 

Be frank with the interviewer. Running a business (and doing all the footwork) is a lot of responsibility. You sound as if you're driving yourself crazy right now just trying to get some work, and that doesn't even scratch the surface on the other part which is doing the work once you get it. Inform the interviewer that you're interested in narrowing your focus to whatever your specialty is, and want to limit how much you are involved in running things all the way from the top. It's perfectly fine. Best regards. 

WHATEVER has transpired, don't worry about it! If the recruiter submitted first, the company's on the hook for a finder's fee whether the recruiter stays involved in the hiring process or not. If your resume reaches HR first, the recruiter's out of the deal. All will be okay unless you've done so intentionally and the recruiter knows that. Things happen, and good recruiters are smart enough to know not to burn a bridge with a candidate because you may be back on the market someday. Others have written about the dangers of a double-submission, but my experience is that it only really applies when it's two agencies submitting the same candidate to one company. So as it is, just keep moving forward. And until you're actually interviewing, don't put too much energy into this one opportunity as it's best to keep a few irons in the fire. 

Make sure you put something similar to this in an "FYI" e-mail to your boss, just so no one can say that your boss didn't know of this lapse. And like the other post says, do your best. There's not much else you can do.
