This is a common practice among all teams besides the Orioles. The ball is thrown to the first baseman so that he can then keep the ball in his glove and use it for the infield warm-up when the team goes back on defense. The practicality behind doing it as the first baseman comes off the field is so that he doesn't have to rummage about the dugout looking for a ball or forget to go back out with one--especially if he is hitting during that inning. A batboy, coach, backup player, or whoever (varies by team) gets it to them right away while they still have their glove on and that's the end of it. I'd say that it wouldn't be a huge deal if this wasn't done or was done differently, so it's safe to say that tradition and sticking to a routine have some role in the practice, too. 

It doesn't say it explicitly, but I assume that by his team, they kind of mean for it to be a single team in a specific league to qualify for that league. As to whether or not voters can consider performance in the other league that happened before a trade, I found a couple articles about Manny Ramirez and CC Sabathia, both traded in 2008, that suggest that only games in the awarding league matter. 

This would be a home run. The foul pole is simply a vertical extension of the foul line at a point, but the line itself (although it's painted flat) could be abstractedly envisioned to go vertically with no limit. For example, if there is a line drive down the foul line that is caught, you can still distinguish a ball being fair or foul even though it never hit the playing field (or any pole). From the Official MLB Rules in the Definition of Terms section: 

So he's also saying that it's simpler and, interestingly, that the stretch isn't practiced enough. I think the case could definitely be made then that for the long run it would be best to become very good at the stretch delivery and then, once the kid learns his balance and throwing technique, add the components of the wind-up to be proficient at both. 

Although the answer depends greatly on your skill, the volleyer's skill, and your respective positions on the court, conventional wisdom says topspin if you can hit it well. Topspin causes the ball to drop quickly (because, moving forward through the air, the friction between the spinning ball and the air creates high pressure above the ball and low pressure beneath it), so if you can hit a shot that will peak on your side of the net, it will hopefully fall near the volleyer's feet. Backspin shots tend to float in the air (high pressure below, low pressure above), so the volleyer is more likely to hit a shot at eye- or shoulder-level. In general, any volley contacted above the net is offensive, and any volley hit below the net is defensive, as the volleyer will have to pop the ball up. So a topspin ball that lands near a volleyer's feet is the hardest for him/her to play. 

Consistency. That is the most effective way to beat a player who is at a higher level than you, especially someone who doesn't have topspin or great form. Practice what my coach used to call your "rally ball." This is a topspin ball that should land around three-quarters court and should pass high (4-5 feet) over the net. If you are able to hit a ball like this consistently, you will suddenly find yourself beating players that play at higher levels. This shot is penetrating enough that your opponent will not be able to take advantage and hit offensive shots consistently, but it can extend a rally long enough for her to make an unforced error, give you a short ball, or get frustrated and go for an offensive shot from the baseline (which is very low percentage). Please not that I am NOT telling you to push the ball. The rally ball is not a weak lob; it is a driving shot with topspin that will force your opponent to stay behind the baseline where her hard, flat shots will often miss long. 

You're right to point out that these awards come from different organizations and that each may have different rules, but if you're looking for a general rule of thumb: to win an award for either the National or American league, a player should play the majority of the games for that season in that league. Even meeting the criteria of having played a majority of games won't make it easy though. "No player switching leagues has ever won an MVP award and only one, Rick Sutcliffe of the 1984 Cubs, has won a Cy Young. Sutcliffe went 16-1 in 20 starts after the Cubs acquired him from Cleveland". For the MVP award, the number of games played is actually the number 2 criteria given to voters (I'm assuming that means number of games played in the given league). There are specific qualifications to be eligible for the Golden Glove awards, for example 

There are two aspects to consider in a play with a possible fumble: 1. was there a fumble or was the ball carrier down? and 2. if there was a fumble, who recovered it? Now think about how often the on-the-field ruling is correct for each of those aspects--how often are they overturned? I can't find any data to back it up, but I think that when there is a fumble, the ruling of who recovers it is correct a very high percentage of the time (or at least is rarely overturned). The ruling of whether or not a player is down before losing the ball is more likely to be a close call, unclear, and sometimes overturned. When a fumble is ruled on the play, either the defense is ruled to recover it (the impact on the game is very high) or the offense is ruled to recover it (low impact on the game compared to if there had been no fumble--maybe a little field position but that's it). Assuming that the officials are usually right about who recovers a fumble, any review is more likely than not going to be focused on whether there really was a fumble in the first place. For the high impact plays where the defense recovers, this is worth looking at. For the low impact plays where the offense recovers, it's maybe not worth the time to look at all of them and coaches are still able to challenge the play if they think the officials got it wrong. So the important point is that officials are more likely to have been correct in deciding which team recovered a fumble than they are to have been correct in ruling whether a fumble took place. When you take that assumption, these plays are only then worth reviewing when the (assumed) "correct" call of the officials is a recovery by the defense because that play has real significance on the outcome of the game. 

I do not practice boxing or martial arts, but I am a tennis player, and every coach will say the same about hitting the ball as a martial arts coach will about hitting an opponent - the power should come from your core and lower body, rather than your arm/shoulder. The idea is to use large muscle groups (quads, hamstrings, glutes, core) to create movement. These are the strongest muscles in your body, so they will allow you to hit with not only more power, but more stability as well. If all your power comes from your arm and shoulder, it will be easy for someone to deflect the hand or stop it altogether, as they will be fighting rather small and (relatively) weak muscles. The physical mechanism is simple - using your legs and core, you can force your upper body to rotate. If your body is rotating, then one shoulder is moving towards your opponent. Hold out your hand and use your arm/shoulder muscles to guide it as you rotate, and you will have a more powerful punch than if you kept your shoulders stationary and punched with your arm muscles. I do not have any training suggestions, other than practicing with this in mind. It helps to keep a slight bend in the knees so that your quads are already engaged. Your legs should be tired at the end of a practice session. As far as conditioning goes, I would suggest rotation exercises with a medicine ball (holding the ball in both hands, rotate it from one hip to the other). To step it up, do it on an upside-down bosu ball. 

Racquet abuse is not the only offense that can lead to a point penalty in tennis. Kicking a bottle, throwing a bag, or using profanity will often lead to a warning from the chair umpire, if not a point penalty (depending on the number of offenses committed that match). These rules are in place to uphold the integrity and professionalism of the game and to ensure that players follow a certain code of conduct. They are analogous to technical fouls in basketball for yelling at a referee or throwing the ball. To an extent, they also serve to protect offender's opponent, onlookers, and any officials. Smashing or throwing a racquet can create a safety hazard for those in the area. In addition, tirades can quickly escalate. 

As with many common sports statistics, there is some "arbitrary-ness" to how certain things are defined and many stats are simply kept around by convention because they keep things simple and are easily understood by fans. In American football it's incredibly simplistic to just split every yard gained into either rushing or passing--and quarterbacks get credit for how well the passing game goes. For fans with a more nuanced view of how things work, it's up to them to determine how useful the stat is and make their own conclusions. Should a running back not be given as much credit when he is going against a horrible defense? Maybe not, but the standard statistic of rushing yards is still kept for comprehensiveness. A better analogy for the quarterback/passing yards situation might be the statistic of assists, whether in basketball, hockey, soccer, or other places: the player gets credit for an assist based partially on how their teammates perform. The assist stat for a great passer in hockey can fluctuate based on many things. However, the fact that a great passer should get some credit for creating offense is somewhat synonymous to how a quarterback sometimes creates yards after the catch with their own good play. Consider two quarterbacks who complete the same number of passes over the same number of yards (with yards after catch taken removed). One of the two may be able to use skill to lead his team to more yards after the catch and thus more passing yards. This can be accomplished by finding the right receiver who is "more open" when he could otherwise have thrown to another open receiver, or by properly leading the receiver (i.e, the receiver doesn't have to jump, dive, or stop to catch the ball), or by having exceptional timing to spring the big play, or by using strategies or methods that can confuse the defense and help the receiver have a more open running lane after completion. That's not to say that every quarterback deserves every passing yard that they are given credit for. I mean, some QB's end up with many more yards simply because their team passes so often compared to other teams. But they can and do have at least some impact on the yards gained after reception.
