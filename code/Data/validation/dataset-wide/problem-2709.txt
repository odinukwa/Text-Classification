One crude answer is that any modern rejection of the Eliatic account (as preserved by Newton, Einstein, and most modern physics with its "timeless" mathematization of "spacetime") would count as Heraclitean, a recognition of the deep singularity of events and impossibility of endurance. After all, Heraclitus was not very specific. You seem to be asking if there are models for the "reality of time" in science, as opposed to the Parmenidean "illusion of time" in mathematical physics. Physicist Lee Smollin ("Time Reborn") has recently made such an argument, in which even the "laws of physics" change through time. Darwin, of course, demonstrated the shocking instability and flux of biological time, a genetic "stream" in which species stability passes away. The problem, as noted, is that science, by definition, utilizes mathematical models precisely to eliminate the absolute "flux" from nature in some system of measurement. Time chopped into reiterative units of any sort is not strictly Heraclitean. It is what enables us to "step twice" into the stream of accidents and retrieve patterns. 

As to the history, my understanding is that Kant himself was aware of early non-Euclidean geometries and was not at all bothered by them. Unfortunately, I do not have a reference at hand. Personally, I cannot see that non-Euclidean findings lay waste to the categories. In fact, I have some vague suspicion they might actually support the synthetic a priori status of mathematics, though how is beyond me at present. The parallel postulate, which bothered even Euclid, brings infinity into the picture, and so your question may hinge on Kant's uneasy relationship between the space-time intuitions and infinity. He treats the infinite as a source of antinomies, of course, but I have yet to grasp how he reconciles it with the intuition of space. As usual, the sources of much standard Kant-debunking can be traced to casual remarks by Russell, who crudely deploys the geometry argument in History of Western Philosophy, p.716. He divides geometry into pure axiomatic geometry and the spacetime geometry of physics, saying: "Thus of the two kinds of geometry one is a priori but not synthetic, while the other is synthetic but not a priori. This disposes of the transcendental argument." [My emphasis... I mean, Huh?] Since we could scarcely have gotten to the physical, gravitational geometry without the earlier, presumably a priori geometry, I have no idea what Russell thinks he has "disposed of." In fact, it is here that I suspect some clue might be found in regard to the synthetic a priori capacities of math, its "unreasonable efficacy." In any case, I simply do not see that Kant's system is so brittle. It is internally coherent but complexly conditional, limited to "experience" but not to "present experience" or any other single, foundational intuition. Why can't it incorporate "mathematical discoveries"? 

Space cannot be a "thing in itself" because is not a "thing." It does not have an unknowable, noumenal "side," so to speak, like the dark side of the moon, because it is not an object. It is the necessary mode of perceiving objects, though this is not exactly Kant's terminology. Space is a necessary, unifying form of any and all experience. It cannot be experienced, yet one cannot have any experience without it. An analogy might be light, which we can never "see" in itself, yet without which no objects can be seen. Space is the "dimensionality" that makes any and all appearances possible. When you think of walking along and "experiencing" space, you are measuring time intervals between apparent objects. Yet with no perceptions you would have no such intervals, no way to measure "space itself" apart from what is located by means of "timed" perceptions. And since, for Kant, mathematics is synthetic a priori, you cannot resort to conceiving of space in some "pure mathematical" way, because you require perceptible geometric "lines" and other "objects" to do so. You need to draw a line, if only in imagination, to "know" that it must conform to certain rules. Nothing, not even space, "gets started" without some experience. Yet once experiences can be compared reason can then infer transcendentally the a priori functions that made them possible and are "already" contained in them. But this does not mean that anything real, such as space, is "left over" if we somehow subtract all possible experience. 

Though the question has been adequately answered, I happened by coincidence to be reading the very quote where Cantor distinguishes between the "three contexts" in which "infinity" arises. First, in the absolute, second in the "created world," and third as a mathematical magnitude, which he strictly distinguishes by calling the Transfinite. Here is his description of the Absolute Infinite: "...the infinite in its most complete form, in a fully independent, other-worldly being, in Deo, where I call it the Absolute Infinite or simply Absolute." 

Your dichotomy and definition of freewill is, I believe, somewhat oversimplified, even faulty. In his famous "Two Concepts of Liberty" Isaiah Berlin distinguished helpfully between "freedom from" and "freedom to," though pointing out their complex interactions. While useful, this only sketches the issue at the more or less political level in arguments between political liberals and socialists. At something closer to the modern psychological level, Kant is perhaps the most influential philosopher of modern, as opposed to classical, freedom. Precisely because we can construct scientific "laws" of natural causality we are to a certain extent "free from" the determination of those laws. We operate under what Kant calls a different, separate "causality," enabling our "freedom to" act towards purposes. But combining this "freedom from" and "freedom to" is still not enough. Imagine you are absolutely free of all laws and constraints, natural and social, a Faustus 2.0. A succession of earthly purposes no sooner appears in your mind than they are already achieved. Hence, your imagination is virtually indistinguishable from reality. Would we call this "freedom"? Well, we might call it the paradoxical "freedom of a madman," which is nearly the same as the most complete absence of freedom. As the fairytales warn us (far more prudently than the political scientists), be careful what you wish for! Kant grasped that the true nature of what we mean by freedom is not only "freedom from" heteronomous influences and impulses. Not mere lawlessness or the anarchy of the solipsistic, absolutely skeptical subject. Nor is it simply "freedom to" obtain whatever Faustian delights occur to us. It is autonomia, the power to consciously create, accept, and follow laws of one's own making. In practice, we don't need to actually do this, but reserve our capacity to critique and accept those laws and duties in conformance with reason and thus among the very preconditions of our freedom. There is no human "freedom" apart from the human capacity for reason. Yet "reason" requires a whole schema of rules. Without both sensibility and intelligibility, "freedom" could gain no real traction in our lives. (This is also part of Kant's moral argument that "freedom" presupposes "duties," which strikes most liberals as paradoxical, leading to all sorts of idiotic crises of liberalism.) By this definition, which I believe to be far more useful, "insanity" is to suffer from a radical imbalance in the prerequisites of freedom. There is no "traction," a heteronomy of impulses, a collapse of the objective "seeming" and "being" distinction, and, in non-Kantian terms, perhaps a "communication" breakdown, the freedom of gibberish. Anyone who has known people with mental breakdowns, knows it is not true "autonomy" and is a condition of great suffering and practical, heteronomous constraint. Recovering of even one's civil liberties is, again paradoxically, a matter of setting and following one's own rules, precisely as Kant might define it. I'm not sure you would be satisfied with this answer, but it seems to me if we simply drop the false dichotomy and look at human freedom as a "different causality" within the grounds of "reason" or, if you prefer "discursive capacity," then most of your specific questions and the state of your problem withers away. Concerning the question of how one is to define proper aims that are not delusional...well, that is a larger, social question that I do not believe Capitalism at present is in any position to answer. 

Since strings and even quarks, are highly inferential, I do not believe we have any confirmation as to their "indivisibility" one way or another. Trends suggest otherwise. We have not reached some unambiguous limit of extensional "divisibility." Quite the opposite, we reach the limits of instrumentation and funding. Logical atomism, I believe, foundered on qualia, definitions, and other problems. The logical positivist "mapping" of Carnap and others was largely abandoned as a failure. At least, this is my own understanding. This is not to say that the work did not have technological value. I carry no torch for Cartesian dualism or 'essentialism," but I cannot accept your question "given these two developments...." Though we do not need to return to Descartes, divisibility and issues of infinite regress have not been slain and may indeed pose problems for any mathematization of "mind." 

As a nonacademic, I am a big fan of audio books, and if you have the money for Audible downloads, they have many, many good PPE titles. At Open Culture, you can find many free lectures, $URL$ Quality varies. The audio format is great for introductions and overviews, then you can read primary texts on your own. A huge time saver. Many of the "Very Brief History" titles are an excellent way to get an overview. The VBH audio titles on Kant, Hegel, and Marx are all good. More advanced philosophy in audio can require several passes. The economics selection at Audible is also very good, though be aware of agendas; I'd especially recommend "23 Things They Don't Tell You About Capitalism" (Chang) and "Keynes/Hayek" (Wapshott). For philosophy in general, I'd recommend a quick overview of Plato, Aristotle, more Aristotle, and Descartes before anything else. And philosophy is much better with a side helping of history of science, a basic grasp of Galileo and Newton at least. 

Surprisingly, I have not yet found a good philosophical work on the concept of "measuring" things. Though I assume one exists. In quantum theory, of course, we encounter measurement problems, and similar problems go all the way back to Zeno or, most intriguingly to me, the fractal "Coast of England" problem. Or the evolution of a measurement for heat. A "measurement" must take the form of an interval between two "points" or limits. And be seen from "outside" those limits, which is where infinite regresses seem to leak in. This could relate to a host of philosophical problems, but I'd like to know if there are any theories or texts that treat them as problems of "how to measure" things. Or what "measurement" means. I feel, as usual, that there is something very basic that I'm not quite getting. 

Yes, there are many "philosophical theories" that have been refuted by the majority of experts. An obvious example is Thales identification of "water" as the irreducible substance. Many pre-Socratic "theories" of this sort spring to mind. But the "refutation" only comes about by the subdivision of philosophy itself into other fields of "expertise," notably physics, mathematics, history, doctrinal theology, or psychology, in which the refutation occurs. Once the propositions become "refutable" by expert consensus, they are almost by definition no longer "philosophy." Thus, in regard to your question, people often scoff that philosophy "makes no progress" or "arrives at no conclusions." But this is because it constantly seeds other fields that are able to "progress scientifically" towards consensus by no longer being philosophy. A more recent example may be Cartesian dualism, which we can at least say is "extremely unfashionable" in philosophy and appears to have "calved off" almost entirely into psychology, cognitive sciences, and so forth. Various other theories, such as vitalism, Aristotelian cosmology, certain identity theories, the positivist reduction of math to logic, proofs of god, strict correspondence theories of truth, etc., appear to have been jettisoned by broad consensus for the foreseeable future. But philosophy remains historical, dialectical, and open. Any topic can be ingeniously reopened. It also remains a huge, growing body of textual expertise still divided into the two (Continental and Anglo-American) genealogies set in motion by Husserl and Frege, and thus culturally impervious to any "consensus of experts." Since the aim of each new theoretical project is, ideally, to become "irrefutable," consensus would mean the death of dialectic and any sort of expert "refutation" by appeal to experiment or logic would mean reclassification as a "science" or mathematics. It is also worth noting how those dominant, massively influential philosophical projects that attempt to "wrap it all up," e.g. Aristotle, Aquinas, Spinoza, Hegel, Wittgenstein's Tractatus no sooner engender a body of "experts" than they fall prey to skeptical analysis, redefinition, and Oedipal, generational assault. 

In reading Koji Karatani's Transcritique, I found myself a bit confused by the distinctions and couplings he draws between these terms in relation to Hegel and Russell. It wasn't actually his approach (I'm not asking about Karatani), but my own poor grasp of traditional metaphysics and vague understanding of these terms. If we take on the one hand, the one/particular/individual/singular and on the other the many/universal/general/multiple what is the best way to sort them out? Are any now considered synonymous, interchangeable, or redundant? Are they always paired up as dichotomies in the order I've given above? How consistent is their treatment, from Aristotle (I believe that's the origin) to the present? What are some of the key texts or historical turns related to such distinctions? I realize this is a big list of questions, overly broad, and I certainly don't expect a "complete" answer. But I would appreciate some general outline or overview of these classic dichotomies. And I'd like to know in what form, if any, they remain "live" questions for analytical philosophy today. 

A slight dissent. While technically "to be" is a verb, Kant argued that it is not a proper predicate. When we say that X "exists," we add nothing to "X." When we say "X is blue" we simply assert a "blue X." He used this to refute the presumed affirmation of the subject in the ontological proof of God. We might easily imagine a language without such a verb or copula, and I do not think it is at all universal. I believe Heidegger claimed that "being" was an original, unique feature of ancient Greek language, and attributed great significance to this, presumably in formalizing the categories of ontology. Perhaps others can correct me or expound. 

Systems all the way! First, I'm not sure I entirely grasp the gist of the question, and while I should read more on the topic, the Chinese Room and its offspring always strike me as incredibly tinker-toy. The community as an irreducible, collective subject has a long, wide history, from The Republic and Leviathan, to Reason or Geist in German idealism, to Levi-Strauss, Luhmann, or textual constructivists. To me, it seems highly implausible to discuss "consciousness" as divisible into individual minds, brains, or thinkers. Or to store it for long in any inanimate, mechanically driven substrate. The medium of consciousness is life. Life is a cellular continuum that reproduces itself, incorporating copying errors and distributing "circuit breakers" in embodied individuals. If there is no "substance" duality, there is what we might call a "directional" duality. Life must "re-turn" and "re-member" itself in order to reverse entropy. Because of this, neither life nor consciousness can be stored for long in machines or inanimate, mediating materials, which are instantly subject to entropic degradation. An interesting example relating to "cultural and tradition" is pertinent here. While archaeolinguists can decode and translate "dead" languages," we cannot do so where there is no primary or secondary common link to a spoken, living language. All languages are fundamentally oral (and only peripherally ideogrammatic). We cannot recover a recorded language by matching it up to objects. (See, e.g. Walter Ong) Where the oral continuum, or literally the "breath of life," is disrupted the language goes dead. One can extrapolate to all machines and technologies. Absent human "breath" they collapse in a matter of days. And they don't go backwards and "pull themselves together." For this reason, I would take a somewhat radical systems approach to your question. Every "community" becomes, in turn, only an "individual" in a continuum of communities called, in general, "communication." This communication must reproduce itself and "mind" cannot be lifted out of it or "carved at the joints." The continuum of self-reproduction must be part of the definition of consciousness. The system that "speaks Chinese" extends not only across generations but to the very rice entailed in reproducing those generations. The factotum in the Chinese Room is no more "conscious" than Schrodinger's Cat until it is "recognized" systematically by that communication continuum. And, not incidentally, earns her daily rice inputs. We do not get to the final "meta-system" of Chinese any more definitively than we get to the final subatomic particles. I am not sure if this position has a name, is absurd, is a cliche, or has been brutally refuted. Conceptually, the "natural boundaries" between systems have to do with semantics or "meaning," but I am not up to grade on the many analytical discussions of this term. I take it to be a dynamic ratio of "possible" to "actual," once again involved in the redirection of entropy. There is no "meaning" inside the Chinese Room because there is an insufficient level of "possibility" for the room and its contents to reproduce itself. Yet "meaning" is a matter of degree. So "meanings" generated collectively across individuals do not imply that individuals are therefore "meaningless" zombies.
