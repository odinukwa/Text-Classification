My trailer is attached to my roadbike with a weber coupling system. How much weight can I pull safely without breaking my frame? 

For the record, my chain looks a lot filthier. I hate cleaning bikes beyond anything. I don't clean my training bike very often, because it's only got cheap compenents and I do not care much if they don't last very long. All that filth has to come from someplace so I was wondering if someone could specifically suggest from where, how and from what direction all that filth emigrates onto my chain and why it chooses to stay there. And then maybe I, or anybody else, can come up with a genius idea of how to stop the filth from making it's way onto my chain in the first place so nobody will ever have to clean it again. Something like this maybe. You get the idea. 

I'm building a bike from scratch and old parts for home-trainer and roller use only. Do I need brakes or can I cheap out? 

I am trying to learn about the maxium lean angle of a road bike. I'm looking for measurements and comparisons. 

As for crashworthiness: Materials which yield before failure absorb more energy. Cars pass major crash tests because they are made of cold rolled steel. That property reduces the G load on the victims like nothing else. The material property most closely related to energy absorption ability is called elongation. Elongation is what happens before the material actually comes apart, but AFTER it starts to yield. Carbon fiber has very little elongation, while 6061-T6 has 10- 13%. Engineers know this, so all kinds of work is being done to improve CF energy absorption, e.g using PEEK as a resin. CF does absorb some energy, especially when loaded in shear, but that is not how a diamond frame tube is basically loaded. The members are loaded in tension and compression although there is some torsional flexing particularly near the head tube. Fork legs have almost no shear going on, hence the complaint that CF forks just snap. IMO CF forks are dangerous compared to most aluminum forks 

There is an extremely small stiffening effect because the interface contact area increases slightly. But in aerospace we usually consider this a negligible effect. To make a system stiffer all the parts have to become stiffer, which of course does not happen because you tighten a bolt in the system 

What is the total weight a Tdf rider carries up the hill apart from his own bodyweight? The bike is around 7kg, maybe a bottle with some water.. What about helmet, clothes, shoes etc? 

Are there Overshoes designed to last on Platform Pedals with pins? How long would a "normal" overshoe last on platform pedals before it shreds? Sofar I've been doing fine with some plastic and scotch tape but the appearance is atrocious. 

I ask this out of mere curiosity. People are talking about getting punctures as if it were something obvious to get. I've ridden well over 100 000km in my life and I've never gotten a puncture. But I did, but only because I tend to let the rear tire wear out until it simply blows up. Roads in switzerland are a charm. There is no such thing as a pothole here. Nails, glass, debris... it just doesn't exist. But everyone else around is carrying spare tubes and a pump on the bike. I know I don't. 

When climbing longer 40-50% gradient sections my front wheel starts lifting even at cadences around 70. Leaning forward doesn't help much, I am already balancing myself on the rear wheel. Today the bike suddenly got out of control, I flipped and fell on my bum. Longer stem? Saddle forward? Can you shorten the front suspension? What can I do to shift weight forward? 

I can't really figure out what kind of bike I should be getting as a "loaner" bike. I have plenty of friends who want to go for a ride but have no bike, and ever since my last loaner got "borrowed" 2 years ago by a friend after the ride, I've been riding solo :( I have a road bike and a full suspension mountain bike. I do light to medium trails half the time I'm riding, but I cover double those miles on when I'm on the road. I want a bike that can be a catch-all for friends to join me. Previously I had a hard tail Specialized of some sort with not knobby tires on it that I left between 50-80 PSI. I also never had had a 29er before, and if I'm going to get another bike, I may as well have use for it too. My full suspension is overkill for the local rail trail. Chances are though, I'll end up on a few good 20-50 mile road bikes with these friends, and I don't want to make them hate the sport due to having the totally wrong bike. Hoping to get some feedback on how good or bad of an idea this may be! I'm eyeing a used Specialized Fate that's priced relatively well on Craigslist. (But there's a hundred other 29er hard tails out there!) 

Based on my experience with carbon fiber at JPL, if you wanted to have a place to put a load on carbon fiber you would have to make thin sheet metal parts that bond to the carbon fiber part. For example, if I wanted a place to attach a rack to a tube, I would form two titanium sheet parts that are about a half millimeter thick into a question mark shape. The leg of the question mark would have mounting holes and the curved portion would bond to the carbon (assuming you want to connect to a tube). Carbon fiber cannot take point loads like metal so you have to spread the load through a bond over an area. I am not saying you can or should do this, but I am saying this is how you attach to carbon fiber if you want to carry a load. The parts don't have to fit perfectly because the bond takes up fab errors nicely. I would probably pattern the design after those old braze fittings which have the little pointy things sticking out to reduce stress concentration as well. Whatever you do, do not attempt to clamp to a CF tube. That only works with metal 

In most cases lifting your front wheel alone should be enough (even with a road bike). It is safer and faster than a full bunny-hop. If you need to lift the rear wheel as well do it in quick succession: Lift your front wheel, than immediately shift weight forward which will send the rear wheel into the air. Then move your weight backwards and pull up with your arms again to lift the front wheel. It is easier than bunny-hopping and you can jump over as many rails as you want from any angle. But you will not really need this technique unless you're on a roadbike approaching a track at 20 degrees. 

In case it is not clear for everyone, let me briefly explain the graph. The pink line represents the Power output along the y axis while the grey dots represent Left/Right balance in Power. The x axis represents time. I was aiming for 360 watts in the beginning. Assuming I had a single-sided Power Meter (for my right leg) it would have showed smaller numbers where the Power Balance was more towards my left leg. The direct consequence in holding a specific amount of watts using a single-sided Power Meter would be that as the Power Balance shifts away from the leg with the Power Meter, the total actual Power will go up while the numbers remain the same. As the Power Balance shifts towards the right leg total Power goes down. The indirect consequence is the mind would subconsciously (or even consciously) learn to use the right leg more than the left leg. Especially in those crucial moments, like the last 15 seconds of an interval. I'm looking for evidence to backup my claim. And since I am 100% certain that I am correct, why do people use single-sided Power Meters? Why do they exist at all? 

One question is whether carbon fiber is the right material for let us say BMX frames. GT made a nice looking box beam frame called the UB2. The problem was that the factory riders would not ride it and went back to aluminum, at least for a time, because what they said UB2 was sluggish, especially out of the gate. Having recently learned about this complaint, I've been investigating whether the viscoelastic property of the resin in the carbon fiber was possibly absorbing rider energy and it seems likely that was. We have another clue because road frames made of carbon fiber are praised for their damping qualities, and so there may be an advantage for a road frame which is actually a disadvantage at a gate start. Some top pro BMX riders have stuck to aluminum as well, and we may have a clue why that is. Resin content of carbon fiber structures is 40 to 50% and it turns out that in the shear and torsional direction, carbon fiber reinforced polymers absorb up to 8 times as much energy as aluminum, around 3-4 percent. In fact plastics are used in conjunction with metals to damp vibration and energy. It has a name which is "constrained layer damping." You put viscoelastic material in the structural system and it damps the system and reduces stresses by dissipating energy 

I'm not a very serious biker in either category, I need a new helmet and I'm thinking that I would rather spend $200 on one awesome helmet rather than $100 on two just-good helmets. I understand that an XC helmet will have more padding and a road helmet will lighter and more aerodynamic. One one side, I feel like added protection of the XC can't hurt, but then the aerodynamic thing comes into play. Also in favor of the road helmet, I don't think I ride crazy enough trails to merit the XC helmet. I mostly ride mild to moderate single tracks in the woods of New England. For a road helmet, I've been searching for a few hours and I've found that POC makes a road and XC helmet based on the same design called the Octal. In the road bike variant, it comes with MIPS. For an XC helmet, I've noticed a few models come with GoPro mounting systems with quick release in case of a collision. I do a lot of night time XC riding and I love the idea of putting a flashlight on that. The Bontrager Lithos and a few Lazer helmets have that feature. I'm not sure how odd they'll look or if the visor wind resistance will actually be a problem on the road bike. Are there any better middle ground helmets that I'm missing? Am I risking my safety more one way or the other? Should I change my mind and buy two instead of one? I've been riding with a Trek Vapor for over 10 years. Anything is an improvement!
