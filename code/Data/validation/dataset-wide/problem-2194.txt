I think you should also consider that you are a new employee and taking an extra day off after a vacation because your vacation made you tired will seem irresponsible to an employer. That's like taking the day off because you have a hangover. It was your responsibility be ready to come back to work after the vacation and be ready to work. Most managers I know would be very unimpressed with someone who did this unless he could prove he was genuinely sick or too injured to come to work. You started a job and a week later you took a planned vacation and then you want more time off? Really, this looks like you are a slacker. You don't have any history with them to mitigate this, so it is a very dangerous thing to do and you would be better off going to work tired. 

We have often had people just fill out one Thank You note (Yes the paper kind) and post it on the refrigerator door in the break room. 

If this is critical to you in making the decsion, then yes ask the question. However, be aware that in doing so, you may be severely limiting your employment options. You are in an industry that is very lopsided in terms of gender. By asking that question you frankly come across as less confident that someone who doesn't ask such questions. You also tend to weed yourself out of the running if there are currenlty no women even if they are fine working with women. I think perhaps you are mistaking the reason for other women's bad experiences and thus are considering asking the wrong question. I have been the only woman many, many times and occasionally it has been bad and mostly it has been fine. And I've worked one place where the only person who was a problem to work with was the only other woman. It has come down to corporate culture in the end, not male/female ratio. So what you are interested in might really be how the people in the office treat each other. It is hard to ask good culture questions. However, you can deduce alot from how you are treated in the interview and from a good walk around of the office spaces. Watch to see how people relate to each other as you walk through. Is there eveidence of a lot of inappropriate humor or sexual type pictures? Do all the men seem to be young and single? Do they play alot of games? Do they work 90 hours a week? Those tend to be the places where I found women are less comfortable. You may be looking for other things. But think about the kind of culture you want more than the male/female ratio. 

When I was around your age, I was attacked by a coworker in the office who tried to rape me in front of 20 other people. It is now almost 30 years later and I still cannot sit in an office space unless I can see who is approaching me. So I understand why you are nervous. Trust those instincts, if someone makes you uneasy, you are right to be wary. Just what you wrote made me very uneasy and I too would have a problem working with this person. Unfortunately when this someone is someone at work, it is hard to avoid that person. So what you have to do is protect yourself until you either find another job and leave (which I highly recommend in this particular case) or he does. First talk to your boss and let him know that this person is making inappropriate comments and staring at you in a way that makes you uncomfortable and that you are worried about your safety. Ask him to not to assign you to work with him if at all possible. Ask for a work space where you are in sight of other people and where you can see him coming. Go to HR is need be. Make sure he has no access to your cell phone number or personal data. You are in a dangerous situation, protecting your safety is more important than any job. Next, never under any circumstances be alone with this person. If he tries to get you alone, leave that area immediately. In your particular case, be especially careful in the parking lot. Always go out to your car in the company of another person. If possible commute with someone else. Personally I would suggest finding another job ASAP. Once you leave, change your cell phone number (and address if there is any possibility he might have had access to it). Could I be overreacting here and the guy be totally innocent. Yes, he could be. But when someone make you feel unsafe, you need to make sure you can get somewhere that you do feel safe. You are not making an accusation here (except to point out that his creepy statements and staring to you make you feel uncomfortable) and you are not asking them to fire him (which would be unfair if he has not committed a crime against you.) But you have to be responsible for your own safety when the situation calls for it. Take the actions you need to take to be safe and don't worry about your career at this point. That is one reason why I recommend that you leave as soon as possible. You will never feel safe at this workplace as long as that person is there. If you can afford to quit, I would do it today. If you see this guy hanging around where you live or if he follows your car when you leave, quit immediately and move. Don't mess around with a potential stalker. 

Have the presenter preview the presentation with you when the person is your junior and help him or her strengthen it. That is a part of your job as their boss. It is certainly what my bosses did for me when I was junior and what I do for people junior to me now. What you want to do is make certain the person doing the presentation gets more in-depth knowledge to be able to answer questions, so make sure to give that knowledge to that person on the topic at hand and tell them to be free to call on you if the questions get outside the area they are familiar with. You might even give the presenter a hand signal you will use when you would like to add something. It looks better if he calls on you to add something than if you barge in. You are also then able to correct any errors or misconceptions before they are made in public. My view on giving presentations (and I have given thousands since I used to teach) is that you should have roughly twice as much knowledge on the subject as the amount you are presenting to be able to handle questions. Now you are going to have to contain yourself when helping the junior prep for the presentation. At all times, you need to be thinking about what the audience needs not how much you could say about something. An audience new to a subject often doesn't yet have the background to understand all the nuances you know and to give them to them too soon will likely make you lose their attention and they won't learn what they need to know. If you really need to answer a question during the presentation that you felt was not answered good enough, then start with a polite phrase like, "To add some more detail to that..." But remember, the level of detail you know is not necessarily the level of detail that people just learning the subject need to know or are ready to know. So only do it when the knowledge is critical to what they will be doing as beginners in the subject. And pay attention to the way people are responding. If eyes start to glaze over, then it is time to stop. Then you also need to work a bit on dealing with being the "Smartest person" in the room. When you think (even correctly) that you are the only person in the room who is smart (and that smart is the best and highest value a person can have), then that will make you project an unconscious arrogance which will turn people off. One thing I read once was that it is very hard for people to communicate with people who are not within about 20 points of their own IQ and I have found it to be true in many cases. This make it hard for very smart people to communicate with less smart people. So if you are truly extremely smart, you have to make an effort to learn how to communicate at the level that other people will understand. The onus is on you for this as you can't change other people, only yourself. You need to tone down your vocabulary and think more about what they need to understand that what you want to present to them. I've worked with genius level people and people who were not very smart. All of them had value as people and as co-workers. You are not better because you have more knowledge. I think from what you wrote, you are starting to tend in this direction, but it is something you need to consciously do. And it's tricky because you don't want to come across as talking down either. Now when the presentations are from outside your group, then the calculus of when to add detail to an answer is different. You want your people to shine and you want to support them only when they are floundering. Outside your group, you want to consider the politics of the situation. Do you need to make the point that your part of the organization has the real expertise in this area? Then you may need to jump in more often. Is the presentation to senior managers who are not really concerned with the nitpicky technical details, maybe less often. Is the person doing the presentation your manager? Definitely, less often. If you have concerns about something he or she said, then approach in private and have that person send out a clarification in an email. Is the person doing the presentation someone who you will be working closely with or a client? Be aware of the nuances of political realities as much as you are aware of the nuances of your technical subject.
