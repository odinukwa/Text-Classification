To answer your second question, for any nilpotent neutral Tannakian category $\mathcal{C}$, (i.e. one in which every object is an iterated extension of the unit object $\underline{1}$), with fibre functor $\omega$ and assocaited pro-unipotent group scheme $G=G(\mathcal{C},\omega)$, there is an isomorphism $\mathrm{Lie}(G^\mathrm{ab})^*\cong \mathrm{Ext}^1_\mathcal{C}(\underline{1},\underline{1})$ So in our case, taking $\mathcal{C}$ to be the category of unipotent lisse $\mathbb{Q}_\ell$-sheaves on some variety over an algebraically closed field of characteristic $\neq\ell$, we can recover the first étale cohomology as the dual of the abelianisation of the pro-unipotent étale fundamental group, exactly as one might expect from the Hurewiz theorem. 

So maybe everything I'm about to say you already know, so apologies if I'm teaching my grandmother to suck eggs. This is discussed a bit at the end of a paper of Fontaine "Representations $\ell$-adiques potentiellement semistables" (section 2.4) where he describes a notion of independence that (kind of) doesn't depend on base changing to $\mathbb{C}$. It's a bit hard to find, but it's in the "Periodes $p$-adiques" Asterisque volume (for some reason, I can't get onto MathSciNet today, so I can't give you better links). UPDATE: The Imperial WiFi is now working properly, here's the MathSciNet link $URL$ From my understanding of it, he claims $\ell$-independence (in a reasonably strong form) for abelian varieties, curves (without conditions on the reduction), and anything with good reduction. As has been mentioned, the good reduction case is Deligne. (Also, as usual, the abelian variety case implies the case $i=1$ for any $X$, so you know $i=0,1,2d-1,2d$ when $X$ has dimension $d$.) I'm not exactly sure how the proof goes for abelian varieties in general, but with semistable reduction this basically follows from the explicit description of the weight/monodromy filtration in SGA 7, Expose IX, together with the fact mentioned by Fontaine that 'compatibility' of Weil-Deligne reps follows from equality of characters on the graded pieces of monodromy. I'm not sure about other cases you mention, like potentially good or potentially semistable reduction. If you knew the weight monodromy conjecture, then (I think) the weight spectral sequence would give you $\ell$-independence, again using the above check for 'compatibility' and the fact that you know $\ell$-independence for the $E_1$-page. But again, I'm not sure how to pass from semistable to potentially semistable. Finally, when $X$ has dimension $2$, since you know $i=0,1,3,4$, if you know independence results for the whole cohomology $H^*_\mathrm{et}(X,\mathbb{Q}_\ell)$ then you know it for $i=2$. There are results to this effect here: $URL$ EDIT: On reflection, the claim that weight monodromy would imply $\ell$-independence for strictly semistable schemes is not true. What is true (and this is used in Saito's paper) is that for semistable schemes the existence of the weight spectral sequence implies that the alternating sum of traces of some element of the Weil group on $H^i(\overline{X},\mathbb{Q}_\ell)$ is independence of $\ell$. He then uses this and alterations to deduce independence of characteristic polynomials in dimension $\leq 2$. 

Functional analysis abounds with infinite dimensional (and so not locally compact) locally convex spaces which (as topological groups under addition) are compactly generated. For example the dual of an infinite dimensional Banach space with the weak $\ast$ topology. The unit ball is compact. Edit in view of the comment below. It seems that there is some ambiguity in the phrase "compactly generated" in the OP. I assumed from the context that it was used in the sense of topological group theory, i. e., that there is a compact subset which generates the group algebraically. If it is intended to mean compactly generated as a topological space, then the same example works---we just take the topology of uniform convergence on the compact subsets of the Banach space rather than the weak $\ast$ topology. This is compactly generated à la Kelley (Banach-Dieudonné theorem). 

Your question is, by its nature, rather vague and here is a subjective take on it in addition to the answers you have already received. Whether this is the type of information that you are looking for is something only you can decide. I will begin with the spectral theorem since this evinced only cursory replies. The two basic dualities in analysis are probably the Riesz representation theorem (between $C(K)$ and the Radon measures on the compact space $K$) and Gelfand Naimark duality. One can extend the latter be replacing the real line as the range space of the latter by more exotic algebras. The spectral theorem for self-adjoint operators can be expressed in the form that the space of such operators with spectra in the compact subet $K$ of the reals (the complex plane for normal operators) is identifiable with the generalised spectrum that one gets by using the algebra $L(H)$ of operators. This is basically a formulation of the functional calculus and has a fairly elementary proof---set it up for polynomials, derive one of the estimates you mention and extend by continuity and the Weierstraß theorem). One can then get the version involving spectral measures by invoking a suitable extension of the RRT for vector-valued measures. This can be extended to the case of unbounded operators using the space of bounded continuous functions on the line but is a bit more delicate to state and prove since one has to use more involved structures on both spaces---not the norm but the so-called strict or mixed topologies (Buck, Orlicz, Wiweger, et al.) As regards the question on integration there is a simple and transparent construction of the Banach space $L^1([0,1])$ in the language of category theory. Denote by $\cal F_n$ the finite algebra generated by the dyadic intervals of length $2^{-n}$. Then the corresponding $\ell^1$-space can be identified with $L^1(\cal F_n)$. These spaces form an inductive spectrum in the category of Banach spaces with linear contractions as morphisms and we can define $L^1$ to be its inductive limit. (As mentioned in a comment, this is the proof given by Tom Leinster). But the decisive point, which hasn't been mentioned above, is that we can identify this space with A SPACE OF FUNCTIONS (better, equivalence classes thereof) on the interval. Without this fact, these considerations remain a mere game with glass beads ("Glasperlenspiel"). It is for this reason that the treatment to be found in the textbooks of analysis and probablity are more elaborate (rather than just saying, say, take the space of continuous functions with the the norm defined using the Riemann integral and complete it). Remarkably, the definition of a Lebesgue integrable function can be compressed into one sentence as was shown by Jan Mikusinski: a function such that there is a sequence $\alpha_k$ of real numbers and a sequence of intervals $I_k$ in the union of the $\cal F_n$ such that the series $\sum_k \alpha_k \lambda (I_k)$ is absolutely summable and $f(x)=\sum \alpha_k \chi_{I_k}(x)$ whenever the RHS converges absolutely. Of course, one then has to show that the basic properties follow from this definition---without Fatou, Beppo-Levi, dominated convergence, Radon Nikodym, etc., analysts and probabilists would be at rather a loss. This is where the estimates come in and is done by Mikusinski in his texts. 

I am currently trying to understand intermediate extensions of perverse sheaves, specifically the proof of Gabber's purity theorem, which states that the intermediate extension of a pure perverse sheaf is pure. As part of the proof, in §5 of "Faisceuax pervers" by Bernstein, Beilinson & Deligne, I've come across the following claim, which is not elaborated on in the paper and which I am struggling to understand. Let $k$ be a finite field, and suppose that I have an open immersion $j:U\rightarrow X$ of $k$-varieties, and a 'projection' $f:X\rightarrow \mathbb{A}^1_k$. Fix a perverse $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}_\ell$ sheaf $\mathcal{F}$ on $U$. Then the claim is that for almost all closed points $v\in \mathbb{A}^1_k$, taking intermediate extensions of $\mathcal{F}$ commutes with pulling back to the fibre over $v$. In other words, for almost all $v$, looking at the commutative diagram $f^{-1}(v)\cap U \overset{i}{\rightarrow} U$ $\begin{matrix} &&\downarrow j && \downarrow j \end{matrix}$ $\begin{matrix}f^{-1}(v)&\overset{i}{\rightarrow} &X\end{matrix}$ then $i^*\mathcal{F}[-1]$ and $i^*(j_{!*}\mathcal{F})[-1]$ are both perverse, and $j_{!*}(i^*\mathcal{F}[-1])=i^*(j_{!*}\mathcal{F})[-1]$. Why is this true? I also have another closely related question, which comes up in trying to understand Delinge's proof of Weil II in terms of perverse sheaves. Suppose that $Y$ is smooth and connected, and that I have a lisse $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}_\ell$-sheaf $\mathcal{F}$ on some relative curve $X\rightarrow Y$, which admits a good compactification $j:X\hookrightarrow \overline{X}$ into a smooth and proper curve $\overline{X}$ over $Y$ whose complement is finite étale over $Y$. Then does taking intermediate extensions of $\mathcal{F}$ commute with pulling back to closed points of $y$? In other words, if I have a closed point $y\in Y$ then should I expect to have something like $(j_{!*}\mathcal{F}[-\dim X])_y \cong j_{!+}(\mathcal{F}_y[-\dim X_y])$ as perverse sheaves on $\overline{X}_y$? Does this basically follow from the first question, or at least from its method of proof, by repeatedly cutting $Y$ with divisors? Any help with either of these two questions would be greatly appreciated!
