There is no way to prevent asbestos fibers from entering your lungs except by certain facial masks with specialized air filters. An ordinary surgical mask will NOT work. The fibers are too small. 

Before, you leave treat your equipment with water-repellant spray, and consider taking a small bottle with you. Some things that come to mind: 

Your body needs a certain amount of salt (electrolytes) to process water (and also for many other bodily functions). If you don't have enough electrolytes then your body's use of water is not optimal. A typical American diet gives you enough electrolytes so that you actually do not need to do anything special to make sure you are consuming enough. If you are eating a "normal" diet (steak, potatoes, vegetables, etc) then there is no need for you to supplement, at least for typical daily activities, and even if you are doing moderate sports. When I go backpacking in the mountains, I tend to not be concerned about electrolytes because the foods we eat out there are replenishing them in any case. If you are engaged in more extreme physical activity, like hiking in the desert and sweating a lot in the sun, then you can supplement your water intake with additional electrolytes. But beware of typical sports drinks like Gatorade, which are not a good idea because, although they give you extra electrolytes, they also give you extra sugar which reduces the rate of water absorption. Instead of these you can choose some sports drinks that contain electrolytes without the extra sugars or other artificial ingredients, or you can simply add a sprinkle of sea salt or table salt to plain water. I grew up in the desert southwest and for us when we went outdoors boating or other activites in the sun, we usually would take along some salted snacks (chips, etc) in addition to plain water or iced tea. 

Weight - Very light, small tents are event backpack-able. Price - Cheap enough to almost be disposable. Large tents are not dirt cheap but are still 1/2 the price of their canvas counterparts. 

It is important to remember that acts of theft are often crimes of opportunity. Thieves like to take something not because they planned to steal it but because it was easy to take. The previous answer suggests some great ideas for truly secure methods but simply running a bicycle cable lock through the loop of a handle or through a hole and around an immovable object is often enough to thwart off a would-be thief. I often use this technique when on short trips when the kayak will be out of sight and it works well in remote locations where a thief is unlikely to be carrying the tools necessary to defeat a lock. Another tip that almost goes without saying is to simply not provide thieves with the opportunity. Simply don't take the kayak anywhere you don't need to. I generally avoid driving around town with my bikes/kayaks on my vehicle if I can. I like to do my shopping before a trip and then load the kayaks just before hitting the road. I know that they are much safer when locked in my garage then they will ever be sitting atop my vehicle, no matter what kind of cables and straps I attach them with. 

Heavy - Thick (but durable) material and steel poles contribute significant weight. Bulky - For similar reasons to #1, they take up a lot of space when stored. Price - Substantially more expensive than Nylon counterparts. Stinky - Can develop an odor that's borderline impossible to remove, particularly if ever stored wet. 

The best thing I have ever found for getting rid of odors, and it works extremely well, is something called "OdorXit" which is based on some enzymes that neutralize odors instead of masking them. I've used it successfully on some nasty things, like animal urine under the floorboards of an apartment I renovated, clothing with foul odors, etc. so, I would definitely recommend using it. Additionally, when you hang things out in the sunlight to dry, this tends to do a good job with odors too. 

I personally use a base layer (which also retains heat even when wet) with the same quick-dry pants that I use for my summer hiking. I treat these pants occasionally with a water-repellant spray and this has served me well for years. I find that anything thicker, like ski pants, are overkill - just to bulky and hot. 

Instead of running or walking, I recommend you go to the gym and do the Stairmaster. This will provide an aerobic workout while building the muscles you need for hiking and scrambling. This is what I do to get in shape for backpacking trips. Edit 3/5/2015: Providing an answer to anatols questions in the comments: I use the Stairmaster 4-5 times a week, 30 minutes each. The speed will depend on your aerobic profile: the idea is to spend the first five or ten minutes building up to your target heart rate, and spend the remainder of the workout keeping it within the target range. You can search online for "aerobic target heartrate" for details. I carry a small electronic pulse-meter to measure my heartrate. Although after you've done this a few times you'll get to know your body and you can pretty accurately guess your heartrate without it. You can use the Stairmaster with or without backpack. I recommend both. With the backpack will greater strengthen the specific muscles and better simulate the backpacking experience. Without backpack is just as good for your heart too. 

I'm looking for some input to determine which type to camping tent I should purchase specifically for car camping. I really like canvas tents as many of their features are very appealing but I know they do have a number of drawbacks. Below is a summary of what I have found in my research. My Background I do not need this tent to be portable (i.e. carried long distances) as this is intended for week-long trips with the family when camping in a single location, most often (but not always) at developed campgrounds. My only constraint is with the packed size as I'm currently driving a small crossover SUV which doesn't quite have the carrying capacity of a pickup truck. The Comparison Canvas Tents Pros: 

Large - Lots of room internally with near vertical walls. Waterproof - Easily maintained waterproofing using a product such as Kiwi Camp Dry. Temperature - Cooler in summer and warmer in winter as compared to Nylon. Durable - If well maintained (not put away wet, will last decades). Repairable - Simple needle and tread can be used to make field repairs. 

Not as durable - Waterproofing breaks down over time and seam leaks are difficult to repair. Small - Large tents are almost (but not always) dome tents to take advantage of the small/lightweight curved fiberglass poles. Temperature - Hot in summer and cold in winter. Slightly invalidated for summer as only "hot" when the sun is shining and I'm not in the tent anyways. 

My Use Case I'm leaning towards a Kodiak Canvas 9x12 cabin tent with a ground cloth and the attached screen porch option. If anyone has any hands on experience with one of these tents specifically, I'm interested in how it stands up against the aforementioned points. I elected for this specific model because the attached porch can optionally be setup or tied back to the main tent meaning that I could use it when no other screen rooms are available and we need a bug-free location for cooking and storing gear under a roof.
