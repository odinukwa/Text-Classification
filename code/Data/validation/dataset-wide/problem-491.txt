Definitely follow the other answers advice to find a shop that offers demos. I wanted to add that one of my local shops (that carries Bontrager) has a saddle sizing station that they have you get up on and measure widths/lengths and whatnot. The saddles for this particular sizing tool are Bontrager specific, but wanted to let you know at least. Be sure to wear what you plan to ride in you have a local shop that offers this service as when you get sized, you will want to be wearing the same gear you'll be riding in for the most accurate measurements. Even with this sizing, ask if you can demo the saddle for a week or so. 

I was having the same issue with my Cantilever brakes on my cyclocross bike (the brakes would stick and not return). My problem was not the brake lever or the springs on the brakes themselves. My brake pads were not engaging flat on the rim and created a lip on the brake pad. Park tool website has a great image at the end of the article for both Cantilever and Linear Pull (V-Brakes) $URL$ 

If your company has the space, I recommend allocating indoor space with a double decker style of rack to maximize space. My company took a 20ft x 75ft space and installed a two level rack, lockers, a bathroom with shower and bike work stand. It gets filled up everyday with commuters, no locks needed (the door from the outside needs their office key card), out of the elements and tools to fix any issues. 

I'm 6'2", 250 pounds. I've ridden a Brooks Cambium C17 (carved) for the past couple of years on my road bike. I've completed one 1200K (~745 mile) ride, two 1000K (~621 mile) rides, numerous other randonneuring rides and countless commutes. In addition to being comfortable it's also weather resistant (important for me as I ride mostly in the Seattle area). I almost always wear padded biking shorts, so keep that in mind. +1 to all suggestions to get a professional bike fit. Proper bike fit is a game of millimeters, and many of the parameters are interrelated in subtle ways. Regarding tires: I understand your motivation for sticking with the knobbies. If you do decide to switch, consider Schwalbe Big Apples. A few years ago I put 2" Big Apples on my 26" hard-tail mountain bike commuter. It made it feel like a completely different bike. They roll well on asphalt and they good for light non-technical trail riding. 

Can you tell if the pain is from pressure or abrasion? If it's pressure, then the it's probably because it was your first long ride. It takes a while to get your butt "battle hardened" for longer rides. Sadly, one quickly loses this after a week or two off the bike. If it's abrasion, then check the saddle to see if anything is rubbing during your pedal stroke. Also check your shorts/pants for fabric seams that could cause issues. Finally, check your saddle height. If it's a bit too high then your hips will rock as you pedal, causing abrasion and leading to unhappiness. +1 to @batman's suggestion of padded bike shorts. You can also get a bike-specific padded liner and wear it in lieu of underwear under normal shorts/pants. 

I've got to suggest just a simple ziplock type of bag, put you phone in, zip it up and put it in your jersey pocket, so your not distracted. It is waterproof and I'll even start my Strava bike app to record my ride. No worries about it jiggling loose off the bike, or getting wet. You can get a box of these pretty cheap too! I'll get more than a few rides per bag. 

Are they FSA SL-K cranks? Mine kept coming loose. FSA advised the use of loctite - 641 for the splines. I had a hard time finding this specific formula of loctite locally, but once I got some my crank stayed on for about a year until I upgraded. 

To make it easier on myself I purchased a cheap wheel on eBay and added a trainer specific tire such as the Continental Ultra Sport Hometrainer Tire. When I used regular road tires, the rubber wore out quickly. The trainer specific tire lasts much longer. You do not want to run the trainer specific tire on the roads. So having a spare wheel with cassette makes it easier to put on your normal wheel for those nice winter days. 

Allegedly, shaved legs make it much easier to apply and remove embrocation, increases it effectiveness, and eliminates the "bugs crawling on skin" feeling when hairs pop back into position. FYI: embrocation is an ointment used to heat muscles & joints on chilly days. 

The Pearl Izumis are my current favorites. They're far from perfect, but they suck less than other gloves I've tried. BTW -- it sounds like you may have a fit problem with the bike, not the gloves. No glove will compensate for a poorly fitting bike. Get a professional fit from a local bike shop. 

Keep in mind that hitch racks intended to carry large numbers of bikes (including the North Shore six bike rack) tend to require heavy duty 2" receivers. Ensure your vehicle is properly equipped. If you have room inside the van, you can use one of these to carry a few bikes (perhaps in addition to 4 bikes on a more typical hitch rack): $URL$ I use the Bike Tote in the back of my Toyota Tacoma pickup to carry two bikes. It works well -- it holds the bikes securely, and is very easy to install/remove the rack to/from the vehicle. 

If all goes well, the pin will break so that the remaining portion is flush with the outer edge of the chain. 

Flip-Flop hubs have freewheel thread on one side, fixed-gear threading on the other side. Many SS bicycles come with this sort of wheel, if you have a sprocket on both sides of your hub, you already have a flip-flop hub/wheel. If you only have a single sprocket (and it is a fixed gear hub, see note below), you can purchase a fixed sprocket and replace the SS freewheel with the fixed sprocket, since both singlespeed and fixed gear hubs use the same 1.37 x 24 tpi threading for the sprocket. Note: @heltonbiker is correct, you will need a lockring with the fixed gear hub, they have a double thread, one for the sprocket and one for the lockring. You can put a SS freewheel on a fixed gear hub, but you cannot put a Fixed sprocket onto a SS hub (it does not have the step down threading for the locking mechanism) 

You want the correctly sized Torx driver. When I had to swap to a new wheel set I used a T25 driver. I just found a Park Tool TWS-2 that has 9 different sizes. You can probably find just a T25 driver at a hardware store. 

We purchased the Bern Brentwood for my son a few years ago, he loved it. There were no issues with fit or comfort. We did not use the winter inserts at all, if it was cold, he wore a beanie style hat underneath. He did use it on the slopes as well when snowboarding, wearing a beanie/stocking cap for ear coverage and warmth. The coldest he wore it in was maybe in the upper 20's F, combined with the hat he never complained of being cold. 

My commute is about 36K each way, and my office does not have shower facilities. I live in an area with "OK" public transportation, and luckily the buses have bike racks. What I often do is take my bike on the bus to work, then ride home. I get a 36K ride afternoon ride in, and I'm not a sweaty mess at work. Obviously this would depend on many factors specific to your situation, but it's worth considering. 

+1 on the recommendations to bring tools and at least two tubes. Also +1 on the recommendation to bring a second set of cycling shorts. At a minimum, bring a second set of padded liners (assuming your shorts have detachable liners). Mounting the saddle on day 2 with a cold, wet, soggy liner is unpleasant at best. Consider bringing fizzy water tablets (such as Nuun). In addition to providing much-needed electrolytes, they help mask the taste of any hose water you get along the way. You'll probably need a pair of padded gloves. You'll be spending a lot of time holding the handlebars, and your hands will definitely get tired (and possibly raw) if unprotected. Ibuprofen is your friend after a long day in the saddle. 

In addition to aerodynamics, not yet mentioned is the benefit to your running off the bike. By changing the seat angle, you use your muscles differently and can run faster off the bike than a more traditional seat post angle. As noted in this article, test subjects were about 5 minutes faster in a 40k/10k Brick (stationary bike/treadmill run). There was some time savings in the bike (even indoors on a trainer), but the biggest time savings was the first half of the 10k. 

I wash my workout gear (running, biking, gym, swimming) in cold water with a sports specific detergent. I add a little white vinegar as well. My favorite is Win Sport Detergent, but cannot find it locally anymore, so I have switched to Penguin Brands Penguin Sport Wash. Then I hang it all to dry, no dryer. This has worked well to get sweat odors and not damage the (expensive) gear. We now have a front load wash machine which is more gentle on all clothes and I think that helps for the longevity of my sports gear. 

SRAM XX1 is their new single chain ring setup. Very expensive and I have not even tried a demo, very wide range on the rear 11 speed cassette (10 x 42) and lots of chainrings available for the front. My understanding is that the chainrings are designed to 'hold' the chain on. The chainring teeth are designed (wider and taller) to have a better grab of the chain. Good review/article here: $URL$ Good image of the chainring enlarged teeth here: $URL$ 

Ensure the axle is properly placed in the dropout and the quick release is firmly closed. If it's even a little loose, the axle can shift a bit and cause the rotor to be misaligned with the caliper. 

You can certainly switch to a more appropriate tire. Schwalbe Big Apples are a popular choice -- I use their 26x2.0 tires on my mountain bike. They roll well on asphalt, and are quite functional on packed dirt and gravel. They're not suitable for loose dirt/gravel, rocks, roots, etc, you'll need a knobby mountain bike tire for those. The only real downside to this plan: If you intend to ride your bike in the city, and often ride trails as well, you'll quickly tire (pun intended) of switching between your mountain tires and your city tires. If you reach that point, you might consider buying a separate set of wheels and keeping the mountain tires mounted on one and the city tires on the other. 

Jan Heine & crew at Bicycle Quarterly recently reported the results of their wind tunnel research. A summary is available online, but the full results are only available in the printed journal.
