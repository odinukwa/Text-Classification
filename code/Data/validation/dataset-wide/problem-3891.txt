To keep people updated, there are behind-the-scenes efforts to get K-theory available from a non-subscription journal archiving service (EDIT: this one, which releases its material under a CC-BY-NC-ND license). Unfortunately this is progressing slowly. I have no firm date when this could be a reality, but one hope was to see progress by the middle of the year (though I'm not confident). PS If one is particularly persistent and know the right people, I believe there is a complete collection of K-Theory articles out there "on the internet". EDIT2: Given the recent developments between the Journal of K-theory editorial board and Bak, I'm a whole lot less hopeful that issues regarding K-theory will be sorted out anytime soon. 

In the paper Pathologies in cohomology of non-paracompact Hausdorff spaces, Stefan Schröer constructs a Hausdorff space which is not paracompact, and for which sheaf cohomology with values in the sheaf of germs of $S^1$-valued functions does not agree with the Čech cohomology (for example - the same is true for other sheaves). The space is constructed by taking the countably infinite join of disks $D^2$, with the CW-structure consisting of two 0-cells, two 1-cells and a single 2-cell, using one of the 0-cells as a basepoint. Then he takes a coarser topology, whereby the open sets are open sets from the CW-topology, but only those that either don't contain the basepoint, or contain all but finitely many of the closed disks. With this topology the space is not paracompact, but is $\sigma$-compact, Lindelöf, metacompact.... and contractible! Sheaf cohomology is non-trivial however. An interesting point to note is that this is not a k-space, and the k-ification of this space is the original CW-complex. 

A short and dirty answer: they should read Imre Lakatos' Proofs and refutations (Google books), to get an idea of how mathematics develops/is built/is discovered. It is little use delving into the thornier issues of (in)completeness, for example, without knowing how mathematicians think about and develop their subject. The book uses the simple example of the Euler characteristic of a (convex) polyhedron, usually expressed by the formula $V - E + F = 2$, and proceeds by dialogues. I don't believe any huge leaps of mathematical understanding are needed. 

EDIT (Feb 2017): Debremaeker's PhD thesis [0] has now been translated into English and placed on the arXiv: Cohomology with values in a sheaf of crossed groups over a site, arXiv:1702.02128 

The Comptes Rendus is (are) a French Academy of Sciences publication, essentially a 'rapid communication' format. It comes in many flavours, and maths is one of them. Proofs are non-existent (at least in older articles I've read), or perhaps only sketched. I don't know what the reach of CR is outside the francophone world (note that CR is bilingual French/English) One preliminary question is this: 

We take the double-negation topology and consider $Sh_{\neg\neg}(A)$. The sequence of objects $F_n = A(-,n)^+$, $n\in \mathbb{N}$ (here ${}^+$ denotes sheafification) is such that 

Please note I'm not trying to do anything with such a formulation, I'm just curious if it is known. EDIT: the factor $\Omega_E/\# E_{tors}(\mathbb{Q})$ is the volume of the stack given by the action groupoid $E(\mathbb{Q})\otimes\mathbb{R}//E(\mathbb{Q})$. Do the other terms measure other geometric objects, such that the whole thing is the measure of some adelic object? 

Freed-Hopkins-Teleman (section 3.7) generalise Segal's (Proposition 5.3) spectral sequence for equivariant K-theory to more general local quotient groupoids (that is, topological groupoids locally weakly equivalent to the action of a compact Lie group on a Hausdorff space, eg a proper Lie groupoid). For this question I am only interested in the untwisted K-theory, and ultimately only in proper Lie groupoids, where the Hausdorff space in the definition can be taken as an open ball in a representation. The definition of the $E_2$ page for the groupoid $X= (X_1\rightrightarrows X_0)$ is $$ E_2^{p,q} = H^p(X_0/X_1,\mathcal{K}^q) $$ where $\pi\colon X_0\to X_0/X_1$ is the (proper!) quotient map to the orbit space and $\mathcal{K}^q$ is the sheafification of the direct image presheaf $\pi_\ast K^q(-)$, for $K^q(-)$ the presheaf $U\mapsto K^q(U)$. This converges to $K^{p+q}(X)$, which in the case of an action groupoid (Segal's original version) is just equivariant K-theory. If I define an equivalence relation $R$ on $X_0$ (or rather the corresponding groupoid) to be the image of $(s,t)\colon X_1 \to X_0\times X_0$, then $R \to X_0/X_1$ is a weak (or local) equivalence, and one can consider the sheaf $\mathcal{K}^q$ as living on $R$. Then $X\to R$ can be seen as a kind of stratified gerbe, for the family of groups on $X_0$ with fibre over $x\in X_0$ the automorphism group $G_x$ of $x$. The stalk of $\mathcal{K}^q$ at $x$ is $K^q(\ast//G_x)$. Now this seems to me to be a version of Atiyah-Hirzebruch/Leray-Serre for a gerbe instead of a fibration or bundle in spaces. My question is 

Let's work in a set theory without assuming AC (for instance, but not necessarily, ZF). Fix a set $k$ satisfying $k\times k \simeq k$, and consider its powerset $X = 2^k$. I have a technical condition that is satisfied whenever $X$ is well-orderable, but I can't tell what other examples there might be. Excuse the peculiar phrasing: I'm aiming for the most constructive means possible (by "well-orderable" I mean classically so: a total order such that every inhabited subset has a least element. This is equivalent to $X$ being a choice object). Let $p\colon X \to I$ be a partition of $X$ into subsets $X_i=p^{-1}(i)\lt X$, $i\in I$ such that the images of all functions $f_i\colon X_i \to X$ have inhabited complement $\forall i \in I$. Assume I is minimal in the $\lt$-ordering of sets by cardinality (if $X$ is well-orderable, then $I$ is unique and $I\simeq cf(X)$). The condition is as follows: 

Expanding on Andre's answer, there is an obstruction class in $H^3(\pi_0(G),\pi_1(G,e))$ (due to R.L. Taylor, Covering groups of non connected topological groups, Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 5, pp753-768, 1954) to the existence of a universal covering space. There is a University of Wales thesis by Mucuk with the main results contained in this paper by Brown and Mucuk which detail when you can get a universal covering space that acts as you want. 

One could also ask if something slightly weaker is always possible, such as choosing a metric locally quasi-isometric to an open ball in Euclidean space. I suspect these conditions are too strong, but identifying what doesn't work may help me shape my proof around the lack of these conditions. 

and it immediately follows the definition of what it means for a stack to be quasi-separated, but they clearly do not mention quasi-separability here. What do they mean by the footnote? What is the "right" definition for stacks which are not quasi-separated? 

Galois connections (nLab,wikipedia). This is really just an adjuction between one category and the opposite of another, where these categories are preorders. A Galois correspondence is when this adjunction is an equivalence of categories. Stone duality (nLab,wikipedia). This is best explained by the linked page, but one I will point out is that one has as a small part of this duality, $FinSet \simeq FinBool^{op}$ (the category of finite sets is equivalent to the opposite of the category of finite boolean algebras), which has as a corollary, the category of Stone spaces is equivalent to that of profinite sets. There is the nLab page duality, but one can see by searching the nLab, there are a number of other pages that people might find useful. 

It seems to indicate that if we accept some sort of reflection principle, use an innaccessible cardinal $\kappa$ (or similar) - hence a Grothendieck universe - and a set of forcing conditions larger than $\kappa$, then we should arrive at our goal without using a proper class of conditions. Alternatively, cannot one (ok, this is very naive, but this is why I'm asking) consider an inaccessible in ZFC and thus cook up a model of NBG, and then work with that a la Easton - and then at the end turn around a say 'Ahah! I was working in ZFC the whole time!' One reason I ask is that in the paper Injectivity, projectivity, and the axiom of choice, Blass gives a symmetric model of ZFA with no nontrivial injective abelian groups using an uncountable set of atoms and a base model of ZFCA whose sets were in some sense 'small' (they arise, if I understand correctly, using the cumulative hierarchy generated from $A$ in the usual sense, but only taking countable subsets of $A$ at the first stage, rather than all of $\mathscr{P}A$). However, he gives a model of ZF with no nontrivial injective abelian groups using forcing involving a proper class of conditions. (Notice that Jech-Sochor is not useful in its usual statement because a global statement about a proper class of objects is required.) Perhaps the techniques given in Blass' Theorem 3.2 have been given a general treatment by now, I do not know.
