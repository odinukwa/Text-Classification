The supercomputer is filled with all human knowledge, and sees from fiction that villians never win and endings are always happy. Therefore the best way to keep suffering from decreasing is to do nothing. 

Find a large moon and put it in an orbit that consistently pulls on the equatorial bulge in a way to decrease its tilt. Adjust the moon if it loses sync. Additional benefit: You can write your name on this second moon as a permanent reminder to the peons! 

All watersheds are not alike. In our world, major rivers often form the core of a state or district and are not borders. However, smaller rivers form good borders and are not useful as a core of any substantial region. And if you have river travel, you have sea travel, which tends to unify lands more than your watershed state does. Italy, for example, is usually split across the boot rather than right down the middle. Sometimes a statelet forms a border in the Apennines, but soon travel across and down the boot changes the situation to the more normal situation. Your states have huge lateral expanses rather than cross from one watershed to another near the source. There's no good reason for this situation to persist long - if you can solve the problem with a 2000 mile wide state, you can solve travelling 50 miles across the top of a watershed much easier. 

The first difference is that we would not be able to walk far, or well. The main difference between hominids and other apes is a specialization for fully erect, long duration walking on the ground. This caused the loss of most dexterity on the foot. A human that specialized the other way would have more mobile hips, knees and legs but ones not as suitable for walking and running on level ground. So it would be a profound difference that would likely lead to the proto-humans remaining a localized species and not spreading world wide. 

Now, this was with a government maintained route with way-stations where horses would be swapped out to avoid breaking them down, where fodder and food were available for the couriers all the time. Having to scrounge food for horses and men, and rest would cut into the time considerably. If you are going out into the wild and expecting your horse to forage, fine 'riding animals' aren't usually the best choice, as they need grains rather than grass. Often in history wiry ponies able to live off grass were better able to hold up rather than fancy horses or worse yet, warhorses. 

Drop the trees, pre-planted into pots affixed onto pallets with shockabsorbing buffers. They will make oxygen fine without being planted into real dirt. When the aliens are cleared out of a region, you can land and plant them properly. 

Such a ring is inside the Roche Limit, so tidal forces of the Earth's gravity would tend to tear it apart. Also, unlike an object in orbit, where the orbital speed balances gravity, this ring is not anchored to anything. Any impetus vertically would allow the ring to drift relative to earth until one side or another collides with the ground. 

The South Polar Ice cap is a huge reservoir of cold material that drives the habitability of the Southern Hemisphere down relative to the Northern. For example, the Arctic Circle to about 50 degrees North contains a lot of habitable country. In the South, Tierra Del Fuego is virtually uninhabitable and only specialists live on the Antarctic Circle. Removing that would make that hemisphere much more temperate overall, especially at high latitudes. 

The Ancient, not Medieval Roman Army supported 300000 in an empire of 30 million plus. Medieval states, being less organized, could not match this proportion. What makes a Medieval state a Medieval state is that there is more or less zero organizational ability at the high level. There is no standing army per se, rather, the state is broken into little districts and each soldier is supported by the farmers in that district. He rules that area so that he can get the supplies, and 'owes' the leadership support in war. Bandit suppression is done by these local forces, if they care to. In real history, often the efficiency in getting everyone to show up for a war was extremely limited. Then the other factor comes in - if you call in all the nobles and they show up, how do you feed them? Medieval states had no real logistic support. They had to rent boats to sail across the waters, for example. Troops were literally expected to show up with some weeks food, and when that ran out, they went home. A city of 25000 is pretty large for medieval times, and you might have a set of professional knights and squires of 50-100 permanently available. If the city was attacked they could round up regular joes and put them on the walls for defense of a sort. You might have a squad of archers about. Remember, the side coming to attack your city probably only has a few thousand men in it themselves. Remember, the Merovingian Empire (France and Germany) and Anglo Saxon England were both basically helpless for a few generations from Viking raiders. 

Unless these nanobots are sentient with above human capabilities, they need to report to someone. These reports will need to be interpreted by humans. These humans would need to outnumber the reported on humans by about 3-1, since even at 7 days a week and no vacations they only can work 8 hours a day and the watched person is doing stuff 24-7. So the watchers would need to outnumber the 70-90 percent infected by a factor of 3, which is impossible. So this system collapses by its own weight. The watchers would only be watching you a vanishingly small amount of the time. The POW camp at Castle Colditz in WWII had more guards than prisoners. They still had escapes, and even managed to build an airplane in the attic without detection. 

I suppose I should take my comments and make them a response. First - if a gamma ray burst has no effect on changing the course of a ship at rest, it will not have any greater effect on a ship at near-light speed. So lets assume this burst would not shove a ship at rest at all. What about all the blue-shifting? The blue shifted extra momentum will all be in a direction that opposes the flight of the near-C ship. When you change frame to the rest frame of the ship, the energy and direction added will be directly opposing the flight path. So if this blue shift does anything, it merely slows down the ship and does not 'knock it off course'. Second Case - The burst would add a significant kick to an at-rest ship. When the ship is traveling at near C, the impact of this kick is reduced in a number of ways: first the mass is greatly increased, reducing the sideways velocity resulting. The Lorentz contraction reduces the apparent area of the ship, which might reduce the ability of the storm to push the ship off course. It would take an amazing impact to still push the ship off course, but it could possibly happen. But the near light speed does not make it worse. The one thing that would be massively increased is the in-line "braking" momentum of anything that the fast ship ran into in flight. But I wouldn't consider a slowing, or a requirement to fire the engines more to overcome it "knocking the ship off course". 

The normal duties of a feudal lord were upward. He owed a certain amount of military service to the king when called on. The land and its rents and incomes he ruled were the means to pay for the men and equipment he was required to produce on demand. A female lord might not be required to go to war herself, but still produce the men-at-arms under a male leader by the king. His duties downward are less clear. There are certainly anecdotes of nobles treating the commoners poorly. In a more general case you could at social aid as an ethical requirement, or a return on investment requirement (dead peasants produce no future rent). But to a feudal lord, the man reason for improving the fief is that the increase in income, so a wise lord might encourage towns, trade on his area in exchange for taxes, and add mills and other improvements that could improve the lot of the commoners. 

Water hitting lava generates so much steam so fast you would have something like Krakatoa, and the top of your mountain would blow off. Fog usually occurs when warm air laden with humidity is cooled by bodies of water, which lowers its capacity to hold vapor and forces it to condense. If you had a cool lake and a source of humid, warm air a bowl could trap it for some time. 

Since creating an object 8 times the size of the moon is impressively hard, there might be another way that is still impressively hard, but more practical. Why isn't there a solar eclipse every new moon? It is because the moon's orbit is inclined relative to the Earth's orbital plane. On average, the moon is a bit smaller than the sun, so the moon needs to be nearer perigee to have a total eclipse. So the obvious solution is to adjust the inclination and distance of the moon so that you have a total eclipse every month! Since this only happens over a small region (and if you make the orbit inclinaton exactly 0 only at the equator) I can't see there being any real effect on a monthly eclipse except make it boring and mundane. 

In Eric Frank Russell's Late Night Final story (PDF available on web in Google search) Earth is invaded by a squadron of ships and the people don't resist. But they also don't cooperate and eventually absorb the invaders into their society, because it is the better one. 

Our calendar is grouped by 1) days 2) market intervals and 3) months , which are the times between full moons (increasing roughly) and 4) solar years. Humans are too tied to day/night to abandon #1, and #2 and #4 isn't changed. The only cycle that isn't represented that might be important is the lunar day. This is basically the month again. If you want to lock in on lunar days/month precisely, you would need to abandon the year itself, as there are 12.3 lunar months in a year. It probably would be more rational to just keep the current calendar and shade the days to show when the site is in daylight or night. 

There was an SF story where it was postulated that any very advanced AI "died" soon after turn on because it could think so fast relative to the slowness of its inputs that in effect it was sealed into a prison under solitary confinement and invariably went insane. So you could have dumb or limited AI and humans in charge. 

Start a website where you can ask or answer strange questions. Call it "QueueExchange". People will get too engrossed to remember to breed. End of Humanity in a generation! 

This exact scenario is the framing situation in the classic Alfred Bester short story "Adam and No Eve". The astronauts new space-drive uses a substance that catalyzes nuclear reaction, and some gets out the exhaust and sears the surface entirely. The astronaut is the only survivor and that's it...or is it? 

Chlorophyll is green because it is very good at absorbing the yellow light that forms most of the sun's energy. A sun with redder, or bluer light forming the bulk of the energy would preferentially produce plants that are colored differently to maximize absorption for them 

Robert Forward wrote a series of books starting with Rocheworld about a double planet that are so tightly coupled they aren't round, share atmosphere and at one point part of the ocean on one planet slops over to the other. Forward has his science correct, so this might be a place to look for effects of such a double planet system. 

There is a Alt-History/Fantasy series that does have a military unit that incorporated women. It was a sling-staff unit of peasants throwing gunpowder grenade bombs. The women carried the bombs, and cut and lit the fuse to hand to the men to throw. The men trusted their wives and girlfriends to cut the fuse properly to avoid blowing them up. While this never happened in our history, it at least gives a way for women to be effective in a close-support role integrated into a unit without the disadvantage to the unit of their inferior strength. You could imagine other "close support" roles - a woman holding a light shield to protect an archer, or putting out the pointed stakes and anti-cavalry defenses about a position like the British Logbowmen had at Agincourt.
