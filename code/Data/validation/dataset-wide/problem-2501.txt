I am not familiar with zazen since I practice theravada meditation. In theravada there is the idea that you have to make effort to sit and meditate. You also have to make effort to establish the 3 mental qualities which will support the meditation. Those are mindfulness, clear comprehension and ardency (sati, sampajañña and atapi in pali). But having established those qualities the meditator has to let go of all the rest and that translates as non-doing or in other words not effort. If one continues to apply effort at this stage the meditation becomes very tiring with little progress. Hope that helps. 

One has to distinguish between monks/nuns that follow a Vinaya and those that do not follow. You may have monks that use such title but cannot be regarded as true monks because they have not been ordained in accordance with, and follow the Vinaya rules. In the pali suttas the Buddha says that he teaches the Dhamma and Vinaya, i.e. the Doctrine and Discipline. So, it is fair to say that a monk or nun who does not follow the Vinaya rules cannot be regarded as a true Buddhist monk or nun. A monk/nun which follows the Vinaya is not allowed to eat after midday and to handle money. There are some food items allowed after midday but those are specified in the rules. 

If it is a past action, strictly speaking, it is the good or bad thought experienced at the moment of performing the action, that recurs at the death-moment. 

The Origins of Insights written by someone whom professor Richard Gombrich once described as the leading authority in the West in the field of abhidhamma, has pointed out through his extensive research of the whole tipitaka that the Buddha only teaches insight after the jhana. So samatha is required first before vipassana and not samatha or vipassana. I won't go into the differences as they have already been pointed in several posts. I quote a tiny excerpt from the paper: 

The proof of the pudding is in the eating, no matter how many books are written about the pudding. Once eaten there can be no mistake about it. As a samatha meditator, both the signs exist for both types of meditation and which still appear when the eyes are open if they are vivid. Having said that I've quiet a few fellow meditators who do not see the signs but continue to develop Jhanas using feeling. 

In The Shurangama Sutra, plus one additional: 11 - Immortals As for categories / grades of each of above, depending on how you group them. eg There are roughly 10 big categories of people mentioned in The Shurangama Sutra, and more sub-categories. As for Gods (excuse for my English), there are 4 in Formless realm, which is above 18 in Form realm, which again is above 6 in Desire realm: $URL$ As for Bodhisattvas, there are: 

Most Mahayana sutras are in Chinese Text, as a result someone who is good both in English and Chinese will help you. I tried google, and found 2 results based on the titles: (however not sure how smart google is in buddhism, so i do not know if they are Chinese versions of your selected sutra) $URL$ （二二一）中阿含例品箭喻經第十 $URL$ 佛說箭喻經 However similar story might appear in some other sutras, the story below is one of them which I read before: ====================== $URL$ (From line: T19n0945_p0126b20(00)) 畢陵伽婆蹉即從座起，頂禮佛足而白佛言：「我初發心從佛入道，數聞如來說諸世間不可樂事，乞食城中心思法門，不覺路中毒刺傷足，舉身疼痛我念有知，知此深痛雖覺覺痛，覺清淨心無痛痛覺，我又思惟如是一身寧有雙覺？攝念未久身心忽空，三七日中諸漏虛盡成阿羅漢，得親印記發明無學。佛問圓通，如我所證，純覺遺身斯為第一！」 ====================== And the English version of above text: ====================== Pilindavatsa arose from his seat, bowed at the Buddha's feet, and said to the Buddha: "When I first left home to follow the Buddha and enter the way, I often heard the Thus Come One explain that there is nothing in this world that brings happiness. Once, when I was begging in the city, I was reflection on this Dharma-door and did not notice a poisonous thorn on the road until it had pricked my foot. My entire body experienced physical pain, but my mind also and recognized the feeling of pain, I knew that in my pure heart, there was neither pain nor awareness of pain. "I also thought, 'Is it possible for one body to have two awareness?' Having reflected on this for a while, my body and mind were suddenly empty. After twenty-one days, my outflows disappeared. I accomplished Arhatship and received certification in person and a confirmation that I had realized the level beyond study. "The Buddha asks about perfect penetration. As I have been certified to it, purifying the awareness and forgetting the body is the superior method." ====================== May you be happy and at ease 

I have done some research online and read articles about zen sickness. There are a couple of problems when doing research, online, on an ailment which, can be "bearing" on enlightenment, because there are lots of "me too is having this ailment", in other words "I too, am close to being enlightened"; And suddenly, zen sickness symptoms multiplied: psychological depersonalisation, etc.. are linked to zen sickness and the definition of zen sickness becomes vague and fuzzy. Even when I confine my readings to only very few recorded accomplished zen/chan masters, who actually do intensive meditations, their descriptions of zen sickness differ, and that is perhaps due to incorrect attribution ( the "me too" phenomena) of an experience to zen sickness. (I decided, eventually, not to provide links because it would create more confusion/debate on it, so don't take my word on it). The zen sickness of Master Han Shan, IMHO, seems to be a genuine description, but I don't agree to some of the discussion, especially the last but one paragraph which begins with: 

Suggested reading: Buddhist Warfare - Michael K. Jerryson and Mark Juergenmeyer. A view of the contents: 

Instead of taking second hand opinions I suggest you got directly to the source, to the instructions given by the Buddha himself. The Dantabhumi Sutta is a discourse with a great narrative and fully outlines the training taught by the Buddha to reach enlightenment. Here it is: $URL$ 

Venerable Analayo through the University of Hamburg has given online courses in 2012 and 2013 comparing MN suttas and MA sutras. So far not the whole collection has been covered but in the material covered in those courses, as I can recall, there are some minor differences here and there but nothing that would put in question the central teachings as we know better from the Pali Canon. In 2014 there was a course about bhikkhunis, and maybe next year there will be another course about MN/MA. You may also want to check $URL$ 

Although known with different names they are slightly different according to their practices. There are many ways in which Vajrayana can be divided or classified and one way is to differentiate according to schools 

Yes, we are taught to understand our fear and see where it comes from. It comes from the projections of our mind. 

Rebirth is the evolving of the consciousness from one life form to another through kamma(skilful and unskilful action). Someone who wakes up in the middle of the night for just an hour and sees that there is only darkness, comes to the conclusion that there is no such thing as light, is making a simple statement based on a very limited time period. Not knowing what happened before and could happen after. The Buddha has seen his own previous lives and the lives of many beings appearing and disappearing in one world after another. What we experience now is the results of previous kamma, yourself and the old man. Is it not possible that you have been cruel in a previous life and the old man wicked, that such events are happening? The gist is skilful actions now and forbearance of the results of previous kamma. 

Recently I m reading a dharma book (The Chinese Version), which 25 great beings demonstrated how they practiced mindfulness meditation.

Technically each Dharma will finally lead you to enlightenment. Start with the one that is easy for you, that you are happy to practice, that does not annoy other people, that you can afford to do. Similar as you eat, pick up the food that is available for you, that you are happy to eat, that does not cause other being suffering, that you can afford to get. Such as your name is Richard, you might start to think what is Rich, what does money do with my life, is it important to my life, and keep asking questions until you have answered many questions related to. Such as your name is Santiago, you might start to ask what is ago, what is time, what has happened to me yesterday, what am I currently doing, what I m going to do tomorrow, do I remember what I did one year ago, what is happened to me when I was young, what happened to me before I was born, and keep asking questions until you are clear of many things related to. There are lots of Dharma that Buddha has taught during his time. Pick one book and read, and practice according to what the dharma book. May you be happy and enlightened soon. 

The most famous Tibetan "Mad monk of the Dragon Lineage" Drukpa Kunley would be an example and precedence. 

There is no samatha jhana nor is there vipassana jhana mentioned in the suttas, I may have missed it! There are the 4 rupa jhanas mentioned with each containing various jhana factors and 4 arupa jhanas. IMHO, the distinction is made to rationalise some meditation practices which dispense with the development of jhanas as a necessary step. 

To the first few questions the answer lies with parami/paramitas. These are the perfections which someone who made a vow to become a Buddha will have to develop to perfection for countless aeons. So a Buddha is someone who have trained for aeons until he is perfect to re-discover dhamma and teach. So his last birth will always be of a high social class. "How does one relate this lives of those who do not have these safety nets?" Develop the ten paramis and situations in life will change in such that one may have the opportunity. In the Pāli canon's Buddhavaṃsa[3] the Ten Perfections (dasa pāramiyo) are (original terms in Pāli): 

There are some suttas which give an indication that there is a time gap between path and fruit meaning that the fruit does not happen automatically following the path. Specifically: Udana 5.5 - Uposatha Sutta: mentions "stream-winners & those practicing to realize the fruit of stream-entry; once-returners & those practicing to realize the fruit of once-returning; non-returners & those practicing to realize the fruit of non-returning; arahants & those practicing for arahantship." SN XXV.1 - Cakkhu Sutta: describes the saddhanusari and dhammanusari - disciples by faith and wisdom respectively. Both are described as following the path - "one who has entered the orderliness of rightness, entered the plane of people of integrity, transcended the plane of the run-of-the-mill", and that "He is incapable of passing away until he has realized the fruit of stream-entry". It clearly implies a time gap between path and fruit. AN 4.170 - Yuganaddha Sutta: says that "developing tranquility and insight the path is born. He follows, develops and pursues that path, and by doing so his fetters are abandoned." Again there is a time gap implied. 

In a bit more detail of the conditions that leads to one practising or not: “If I arise and cease dependent on other things then where does my own effort come into it? If I decide to practice the Dharma how does that come about? Isn't my decision to practice just the interplay of causes in a big interconnected web?” It is not only our effort which gets us to continue our practice, there are lots of skilful/unskilful conditions that conditioned us. I’ve listed them down with their conditions. It is not exhaustive but just an indication of how complex are these interplay of conditions. There is also the repetition (habit) condition (Asevana paccayo) when we do our practice daily. i. There are six Roots Condition (Hetu paccayo): 

The subconscious mind in Buddhism is the Bhavanga, (mindstream, store-consciousness) where the results (vipaka)of past actions kamma is deposited. In the silence of the meditation practice sometimes they "bubble up". ruben2020 has outline what to do.
