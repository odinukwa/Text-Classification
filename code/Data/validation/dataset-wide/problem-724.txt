The answer is "both, depending." The majority of current bicycle cyclometers use a reed switch and timer, and measure the time between successive triggerings of the switch as a magnet passes by. An advantage of this method is its simplicity and low cost, though if the magnet is ill-positioned or if the rotational speed of the wheel is too high, the reed switch can get fooled since it takes a while for the reed switch to reset itself. A less common approach (used by the old Avocet line of speedometers, including the venerable and venerated Avocet 50) used an induction coil and magnet ring with 20 small magnets attached around the hub. The induction coil could rapidly count the change in current. You can see the details of this approach in the Avocet patent application for the 50, but its designer discussed some of the idiosyncrasies of that approach in this Usenet post from 1994. Although these two different methods can be used to collect the data needed to calculate speed, the exact algorithms used may differ from device to device. One can see this in the way that cadence is often calculated. Almost all bike computers that have a cadence sensor use a reed switch, since the rotational speed of the cranks is low enough for reed switches to reset. However, different manufacturers use different averaging periods, time-outs, delays, and triggering events before displaying the result. Speed calculations work similarly, and one can occasionally see the evidence of these choices by examining speed and cadence data from bicycle computers that store these values and allow them to be downloaded after the ride. Here, for example, is a graphic that shows the speed recording from three different devices that were mounted on the same bicycle for the same ride (a PowerTap, a Polar S710, and a SRM Pro -- these are power meters but here we focus only on the recorded speed). Each device was set with the same wheel circumference but the histograms show that each stores and reports slightly different speeds. 

Yes, there are "couch to century" training plans. Depending on your problem, a century can be easier on your knee than a marathon since the maximal force during cycling is lower than during running. Here is a link to a typical "10-week" training plan. If you search around a bit you can find training plans from 8 weeks up to perhaps 14 weeks. 

As you can see, the winners' average speeds in the 1970's and 1980's were below trend, while speeds in the 1960's, 1990's and 2000's were above the long-term trend. So, even if the long-term trend in speeds can mostly be explained by Tour length (the correlation between Tour length and winner's speed is about 0.8), some have pointed to this secondary effect in the residuals as further evidence of doping. However, there are two counter-arguments, one slightly weaker and one very much stronger. The weaker argument is based on the observation that the residuals are "double-peaked" and speeds in the 1960's were also higher than the trend, then dropped in the 1970's and 1980's. If doping were the simple explanation, one would have to explain the drop in the 1970's and 1980's, not just the rise in the 1990's and 2000's. However, the stronger argument is based on examining data from other races and comparing them to the Tour. If one were to examine the residuals from a similar plot of speed vs. distance for the Giro and Vuelta, one would see that the years when their speeds were above (or below) their own trend lines did not correspond with the same years for the Tour. That is, the speed residual for the Tour and the speed residuals for the Giro or Vuelta are not "synchronized." Thus, if doping behavior explained the reason why Tour speeds were higher than would be predicted from distance, then one would have to explain why doping behavior was different in the Tour and Giro (or Vuelta) in the same year, often with the same riders. Below I include a plot that shows the "residuals" from the Tour (that is, residuals from the regression of winner's average speed on Tour length) plotted against the same residuals for the Giro. This does not mean, of course, that there is no doping in either the Tour or the Giro -- it simply means that one cannot use average speeds as evidence of that doping. Conversely, it also means that one cannot use doping as an explanation for increased average speed. Taken together, it does support the evidence that race organizers's decisions about the routes is a main determinant of the average speed. 

Plain-gauge (PG) spokes will break at the shoulder (where they leave the hub) due to metal fatigue at some point during the life of the wheel. Varying the tension in a PG spoke tends to vary the amount of bend at the shoulder; varying the tension in a double-butted (DB) spoke tends to vary the length of the thinner section, which is much better from a fatigue perspective. There is no feel difference between 2.0mm-straight spokes, 2.0/1.8 DB-spokes and 2.0/1.5 DB-spokes at the same tension with the same rim. Source: I built them and rode them. There is no load-carrying difference between DB spokes and PG spokes either. Load-bearing capacity is a function of the spoke tension and the spoke count. If you take a look at the spoke specs of at least DT Swiss and Sapim spokes you will find that the DB spokes will take the same tension as (and often more than) their PG counterparts. The other option to consider is bladed spokes like the Sapim CX-Ray, which are basically DB spokes with the thinner section pressed flat. This has some nontrivial aerodynamic benefit and is also a bit easier to build with because you can hold the spoke straight: no need to worry about spoke wind-up. 

The NDS bottom bracket cup isn't installed correctly in your photo; you have a 2-3mm gap between it and the frame when there should be no gap at all. If that's as far as it gets with the spec torque (40Nm usually) then remove it and check the threads on both the shell and cup for anything which would stop it going in all the way and clean anything you find off. 

Campagnolo 10 speed cassette is only 0.6mm wider end-to-end than their 9-speed cassette, so as long as the 9-speed setup still has that much adjustment in the limit screws you should be fine on that count. The jockey wheels only care about the inside width of the chain which is 3/32" on pretty-much all derailleur gear systems that have ever existed, so you won't need to change them for that reason. I would try it, if it doesn't work you can always fall back to your 9-speed plan. 

Some data points: Almost all the factory-built fancy wheels I see on group rides are now laced 'passing' rather than 'crossing'. Seems to be standard practice across Campagnolo, Fulcrum, Shimano, Zipp, Mavic, etc. This may be because they like to use bladed spokes and perhaps there is an incompatibility there. But it may also be that it is as strong and removes a warranty-claimable failure mode. I did a google image search for 'broken spoke' which finds a lot of spokes broken at the elbow (as you would expect) and very few broken elsewhere. However the few which have broken elsewhere (and not as the result of a crash) look to have broken at the 'crossing' point. This makes sense because it should be the most-fatigued point in a double-butted spoke laced 'crossing'. I tried building a set of wheels 'passing' not 'crossing' and here are my observations: It was easier to lace the spokes. Tensioning and truing was more difficult because the tension of the inside spokes needs to be significantly less than the tension of the outside spokes to exert the same lateral pull. I had to cross the spokes on the rear drive-side: a short test revealed the rear mech was clipping the outside spoke otherwise. That was on an 11-speed hub with 10-speed drivetrain and the 1.8mm spacer behind the cassette, so on a true 11-speed system or with a 10-speed hub it might be possible to rip the mech off entirely. With disc brakes you might need to cross the spokes on the caliper-side to clear the caliper. With normal hubs and J-bend spokes I recommend that you interlace all sides of both wheels because the benefits of even spoke tension for all spokes on the same side of the same wheel far exceeds the minor benefits of not interlacing the sides you don't need to interlace. Looking at my wife's DT Swiss wheels they are laced crossing with the inside and outside spokes leaving the hub from almost the same plane, so they are close to achieving the benefits of both systems. 

This is a textbook cable tension issue. Since you stated that your highest and lowest gears are working well, I assume that the middle gears are the ones that are slipping. You could take it back to the bike shop and explain this to them and they'll surely fix it for you. Given the time that has passed since they last touched it, they'll probably charge you. If you want to just fix it yourself, use the thumb and index-finger adjusters either up near your shifter or down at the derailleur. First, shift to a gear that slips, preferably the most centered gear on your cassette. Looking down onto your bike from above, or from behind the back tire, align your eye with your chainline and your cassette. Twist the cable tension adjuster to increase or decrease the cable tension and watch the derailleur move away from, or toward your spokes. Center up the line that the chain is running by watching your cassette and the derailleur pulleys. These will likely be very small adjustments! Center it up and then jump on and go through the gears. If you get it close, then use the adjuster up near your shifter to fine tune it while you pedal. If you can't get it, the cable might have stretched to the point where it needs to be reset at its anchor point at the derailleur. Bike shops should know to stretch all cables when they are installed and test ride everything, but this is a good thing to know how to do. 

In my experience, bike shops don't make much money off of turning wrenches. It then follows that they don't typically care for some bike that you chose to buy online instead of from their showroom, which is where most of their money is made. If you buy something that doesn't align well with a particular shop, i.e. an overly cheap bike and a shop that deals a lot with higher-end stuff, they might not want to associate themselves with such an inferior product. Cheap shifters and derailleurs, for example, can be impossible to dial in. One can not expect even a seasoned mechanic to be responsible for cheap metals that bend under pressure as their eventual imperfect performance could then be associated with his work or his shop. As a second example, cheaper rims can be a nightmare to true; as is expecting them to remain so. The time that it takes to work with a cheap bike is not worth the shop's time. All of this being said, however, just go into the bike shop and explain your situation to them. If you're ordering something that they think is worth their time, then expect to pay at least $100 to $125 for them to properly assemble it and tune it. They might even be able to show you something there in the shop that is comparable to what you're interested in! 

If you use the chainrings you have, which are designed to be shiftable, you will find the chain comes off them quite easily if you are in the extreme ends of your rear gears. If you're riding on paved surfaces you can solve this by fitting a narrow-wide chainring instead: there are plenty of vendors including Absolute Black, SRAM and Race Face; I've used all of those and they work well. As Alexander suggested you can stay with shiftable chainrings and use the front mech as a rudimentary chain-retention device. To do this you detach and remove the shifting cable and shifter then turn the lower limit screw until the mech is in the desired location. You can completely lock it in position using the upper limit screw as well if you like, but the lower limit screw and the spring should be enough. I wouldn't do it this way as you're unlikely to be able to use the full range of the cassette without the chain rubbing at the front. Maybe it's a good way to find out if you want to go to a single front ring before you pay for the proper chainring. 

Let's start at the outside and work our way inwards. Most tyres don't care which way they rotate, although as others have said it may be beneficial to keep it going the same way for its lifetime. It might be slightly better for the fatigue-life of the spoke holes in the rim, the nipples, the hub flanges and the spokes if they are always put through the same load cycle as the wheel rotates; but my strong suspicion is that with correct (high) spoke tension the difference will be minuscule. On a rim-braked bike the the braking surface will fail first; on a disc-braked bike you'll destroy the wheel on potholes/cobbles/rock gardens before these are a problem. I can't see any issue at all with the hub shell, bearings, axle, or QR. 

If you have the GXP Red cranks (more normal) you want a Pressfit GXP Bottom Bracket. If you have the BB30 Red cranks you want a Pressfit 30 BB However not all press fit systems are created equal. I would have your LBS check compatibility, and supply and fit a suitable part. SRAM make both of these in the whole range of series from Red down to non-series Truvativ-branded versions. 

DT Swiss make a series of spokes called which incorporate a re-usable thread-lock type feature. You can build these over several days no problem and re-true them for years without trouble. It isn't blue, so that isn't what you have. The usual blue stuff is Loctite 242 which I would not personally want to use on spokes because it sets in ten minutes and is fully cured after 24 hours; after it cures you can fully break it apart but not make small adjustments, so later truing will not really work. Should you wish to remove it Loctite's data sheet suggests the correct solvent to use is . I personally use grease on spoke threads, as on any other threads which don't need locking. With grease or you can take as long as you like. I never tried for lack of a UK supplier at a reasonable price.
