Footwear is required in all official games of football. Trainers/runners are fine - specialised football shoes/boots are not required, although you may have trouble keeping your footing on natural turf fields in trainers/runners. IFAB Laws of the Game, Law 4 - The Players' Equipment, Section 2 - Compulsory Equipment (emphasis added): 

In practice this rarely happens, as one foul will usually occur before the other, even if it is by fractions of a second. The only time I can imagine simulataneous fouls occurring is if two players from opposing teams dive in to win the ball and collect each other instead. Even in this situation, they'd probably have to be facing each other, as a side-to-side collision where both players are using similar amounts of force is unlikely to be seen as a foul. In the situation you described, most pushing and holding occurs at a corner kick before the ball is put into play. If this is the case, the restart would be a retake of the corner kick. 

These are some of the questions the referee decides answers to in an instant as part of their foul recognition process. In the Neuer / Higuain incident, the referee decided that the collision after the challenge was caused by Higuain, awarding a direct free kick to Germany. I tend to disagree here, as the majority of the force in this challenge was caused by Neuer, due to the pace he was moving at and due to his knee being raised high. Higuain had a right to be where he was on the field without being cleaned up. The collision was unavoidable as part of the challenge, but the challenge was made with complete disregard for the consequences of the opponent. There was no way to make a safe challenge here at that pace. I believe Neuer should have been cautioned and a penalty kick should have been awarded to Argentina. As you see on the following links, here, here and here a number of experienced match officials tend to agree with my view that the referee made an incorrect decision here. In the Fucile / Sanchez incident, the referee decided that in spite of winning the ball, Fucile acted with complete disregard for his opponent and that the challenge was reckless and hence cautionable. I tend to agree with the referee here - the challenge is fast and catches a large amount of Sanchez with a decent amount of force. 

When the ball is in play, the assistant referee will do their best to remain in line with whichever one of 

No, the goal should have been allowed. The referee was incorrect in calling offside here. Contrary to what has been suggested in other answers, the only time offside position should be evaluated for the purposes of determining when an offence has occurred is when the ball is last touched by a teammate. p. 36 of the 2015/16 FIFA Laws of the Game (emphasis mine): 

Teams have no say in whether extra time is played and cannot request more. The full time allotted (usually two equal periods of 15 minutes) must be played, and if the scores are level after this time, kicks from the penalty mark must be used to determine the winner. If the competition rules do not allow kicks from the penalty mark to be used, the match is drawn and the teams must be separated (for the purposes of qualification, or deciding the winner of the final or cup being contested) by some other procedure - such as a replay, a coin toss, or some other method as determined by the competition rules or competiton administrator. Extra time is commonly confused with the allowance for time lost (or, as it also known, additional time) played at the end of each period to compensate for significant delays to restarts during the period. The term extra time should only be used to refer to the procedure used to determine the winner at the end of a drawn match. 1 - in some competitions, the away goals rule is used - in these competitions, extra time is only played if the teams cannot be separated based on both the aggregate score over both of the home-and-away matches and the number of away goals scored. 

For free kicks, referees may allow players to move the ball out of a small hole, as there is always some uncertainty as to where the offence occurred and hence where the restart location should be. For penalty kicks, this is not possible, as it explicitly states in the Laws where the ball must be placed. However, it does not state that the centre of the ball has to be placed exactly over the centre of the mark. If part of the ball is overhanging the mark ,that should be sufficient for the referee (this is consistent with principle applied elsewhere in the Laws that the ball is considered on a line even if only part of the ball is on that line). This allows players plenty of latitude to avoid small holes in the penalty mark. If the hole is so large that a penalty kick cannot be legally taken with the ball out of the hole, it is clearly dangerous and has potential to cause injury to players who may trip over it or roll their ankle in it. The referee should suspend the match until the ground officials (which at a local level, could be the home team) have filled the hole with sand or dirt and have re-marked it. The referee does not explicitly have the power to suspend the match due to the field being in a state of disrepair, but it is implied in Laws 1 and 5. Law 1.2, The Field of Play - Field Markings: 

The exact wording of the sending of offence in Law 12 - Fouls and Misconduct, Section 3 - Disciplinary Action is: 

In summary, a single bounce of the ball is not enough to relinquish possession. Before the ball can be challenged for by an opponent, the keeper must have let it bounce away and no longer be able to either kick it (ie. a drop kick) or regather it in their hands or arms before it strikes the ground for a second time. If the goalkeeper allows the ball to bounce on the ground multiple times, most referees will consider it released and therefore free to be challenged for by an opponent. As an aside, by standing where he was, the opponent had probably already committed an offence by preventing the goalkeeper from releasing the ball from his hands (as mentioned in the second quote above), even before he challenged for the ball. 

It depends. If this is all the information I have, I would probably would be doing nothing and allowing the team to make a substitution at the next stoppage. The FIFA Laws of the Game state: 

Impeding A player may not shield the ball if it is not in playing distance. For example, if a player stands in front of the goalkeeper on a corner kick, and then moves to prevent the goalkeeper getting around them, this should be called as impeding. Law 12 - Fouls & Misconduct, 2016/17 Laws of the Game: 

The goal area - colloquially known as the six yard box - serves a number of purposes. Its primary purpose is to designate the location from which goal kicks are to be taken. On p. 51 of the 2015/16 FIFA Laws of The Game: 

This differs widely, based on a large number of factors. Unlike a penalty kick, which is always taken from the same location, with no wall and only the goalkeeper to beat, free kicks can be influenced by defenders in the wall, defenders on the post, attackers making deceiving runs, position of the ball, and wind direction and speed just to list a few factors. In the 2012 English Premier League season, OptaPro found that the average conversion rate was 5.7%. The Power of Goals has some data on the conversion rates of English Premier League players from 2002 - 2012. In this data set, Seb Larsson tops the list with a conversion rate of 8.6%. 

This means that if a player who has left the field deliberately re-enters the field of play and involves themselves in active play before the ball has been played by the defending team towards halfway, out of the penalty area, and they are not penalised for offside, they must be cautioned for re-entering the field of play without permission. If this occurs, an indirect free kick is awarded to the defending team. As always, an attacker who accidentally finds themselves carried off the field by a natural playing movement (e.g. a challenge by an opponent, or their momentum from a run) is not affected by either of these restrictions, provided that they re-enter the field in a timely manner. 

This means, the indirect free kick is taken from where the offside player touches the ball, or otherwise interferes with an opponent. If an offside-positioned, attacking player off the field somehow manages to interfere with an opponent (I see this as fairly unlikely), an indirect free kick is awarded on the field of play, closest to where the offence occurred. Law 11.4: 

Depending upon the competition rules, there are many possible outcomes. Some of the common possibilities in competition rules that I've seen are: 

Whether a player is in an offside position or not is determined when the ball is last played by a teammate. This is described (albeit in a poorly worded manner) on p. 36 of the 2015/16 FIFA Laws of the Game (emphasis on relevant phrases mine): 

At this point, you will notice that there are two defending players closer to the goal line (the goalkeeper, and the white defender standing directly in front of him) than every other black player. p. 36 of the 2015/16 FIFA Laws of the Game 

NB As with the caution codes, these may change next season, as the ordering of sending-off offences in the Laws of the Game has also been modified (there is no meaningful order to these). 

If any teams are level after applying all three criteria in this order, section 50.5 (d) - (f) states that the matches played between the equal teams are then ranked by (once again): 

In the sixteenth minute of the half, #1 put on the #3 shirt, and #3 put on the #20 shirt as part of a goalkeeper change. In matches that don't use return substitutes (as mentioned in Law 3.2): 

However, it is a general understanding amongst referees (think of it as common law) that players should not be cautioned for persistent infringement when the infringement only harms their team eg. taking a free kick to oneself, incorrectly taking a throw-in, offside. This forum thread on RefChat highlights this: 

It also limits how close to goal a dropped ball is taken from. On p. 32 of the 2015/16 FIFA Laws of The Game: 

NB the goalscorer and minutes of goals are not recorded in these competitions. However, I am always in the habit of recording this information, as occasionally I do referee competitions where this information is required. For each send-off that occurs within the match, a separate send-off report must be completed. Information such as the location and round can usually be obtained via the competition website, but it is important to ensure that the player's name is copied from the team sheet, as the team sheet remains with the home team at the conclusion of the match. 

Many higher-level leagues have a number of criteria for entry aside from first-team performance, and one such criterion is ground facilities. This criterion includes not only dressing rooms, lighting and spectator seating, but also the quality of the field. A field with dimensions completely inconsistent with others in the league is likely to be seen as inadequate. The reason that such a large range of sizes are still allowed, is that football is played in a variety of locations - some in which the land is not readily available to construct an international-sized pitch. It may be possible to find a nearly-square pitch in recreational leagues in developing nations, but once a club has reached a semi-professional league (ie. a league in which some players receive some remuneration, but not enough to derive a steady income) it will have a pitch with dimensions that are very close to, if not consistent with an international-sized pitch. 

It's completely fair. The opponent did not break the Laws in challenging your player, so why should they be punished for it? It's certainly unfortunate - just like it would have been if your teammate had rolled an ankle or slipped over while chasing the defender. If your teammate's equipment doesn't fit will enough to prevent it coming off in a challenge for the ball, he's probably most at fault for choosing equipment that is unsuitable. 

The full text of these offences is found on pages 37-38 of the 2015/2016 FIFA Laws of the Game, which is too long to quote in full here. As seen, contact does not necessarily mean there is a foul - for some offences it must be either careless, reckless or excessively forceful. These are defined on page 119 of the 2015/2016 FIFA Laws of the Game: 

The second offence is carelessly, recklessly, or excessive forcefully tackling or challenging an opponent. Law 12.1: 

gdrt's answer provides an excellent summary of what occurred in the incident you provided as an example. In general, a player cannot receive multiple "red cards" in the same match. The reasoning behind this becomes apparent when you refer to the sanction as a sending-off, rather than a "red card". The card is only a signal of the sanction. Law 12 - Fouls and Misconduct, Section 3 - Disciplinary Action: 

There are a number of factors to consider here. The most important is whether the ball is in playing distance. Law 12 - Fouls and Misconduct, Section 2 - Indirect Free Kick states: 

According to the Wikipedia article on tackling, tackling with both legs is illegal. However, this tackle by Sol Campbell is clearly made with both legs, and it didn't appear to be called nor appealed for by any of the players, nor discussed by any of the commentators. Is tackling with both legs in itself illegal, or does the tackle need to be careless, reckless, or excessively forceful before it is deemed to be a foul? 

It will most certainly be the attacking team protesting here. Since the defending team will most likely be under pressure near their own goal, advantage should not be played if the referee needs to take action against dissenters. Play is stopped, any player(s) guilty of dissent is/are cautioned, and play is restarted with an indirect free kick taken by the defending team from wherever any dissent was being delivered from. If multiple players are committing dissent, the restart is taken from the position of whichever one is closest to their own goal line (this could even be the opposing goalkeeper, which would see the ball moved ninety metres down the other end of the field). This is demonstrated on p. 38 of the 2015/16 FIFA Laws of the Game: 

This is a common problem with the 2016/17 Laws of the Game. The entire document was rewritten, and this was rushed through without seeking feedback from the global community of players, managers, referees and other officials for an extensive period, so contradictions occur, or entire sections appear unclear. 

When the match is completed, I will also add the player's name from the team sheet to the reverse side of the page. Send-offs are recorded using the following scheme in my book: 

It is impossible to commit a direct free kick offence against a teammate. This is because, in Law 12.1, it states that all direct free kick offences (except for deliberately handling the ball) must be committed against an opponent1. Since this rules out a caution, the sending-off offence for challenges for the ball, serious foul play should be considered. Law 12.3 (emphasis added): 

Also worth mentioning are blades and artificial turf shoes. These are less common, but artificial turf shoes are being used more regularly as more artificial turf pitches are being constructed in areas where grass does not grow easily, readily or cheaply. I've sourced the information from personal experience and from Kitbag's blog, Pro-Direct Soccer and ebay's football boot buying guide. 

If the referee believes a player has committed the offence of playing in a dangerous manner, the restart is an indirect free kick to the opponents. Note: if contact occurs, the foul must not be sanctioned as playing in a dangerous manner, and a direct free kick offence should be considered instead. 

In some elite matches without goal-line technology (such as UEFA competitions), additional assistant referees (who are positioned slightly behind the goal line) will also help the referee make goal/no goal decisions. The relevant information is on p. 85 of the 2015/16 FIFA Laws of the Game:
