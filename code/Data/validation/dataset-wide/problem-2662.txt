Is our reality nouminal or phenomenal? Do we perceive actual reality or a simulation of reality of which our brain is the simulator. This is not to be confused with the simulation hypothesis (which postulates that the universe and everything in it, including ourselves, exists only as a simulation) or solipsism (which postulates that nothing outside the mind exists). This refers to indirect realism as first put forward by Emmanuel Kant in 1781. $URL$ 

Is it possible that consciousness arose because of the conflict between 'self interest' and 'pack interest'? Does the 'level of consciousness' depend on the 'size of the pack'? Humans are social creatures. That's just a nice way of saying that we're pack animals. But packs don't work if each individual only looks after his own best interest. This is why we evolved emotions such as guilt and pride. 

By convention: A definition that intentionally restricts the range of the defined notion to a particular field of application. There are numerous such examples in science. For example in mathematics an in particular in Finite-Dimensional Analysis one can find the definition that inner product is the binary relation: 

Contextual: A definition from the context, formally having the structure "Def(Q): Not P Then Q" (Definition of Q). Example: 

Etymological: The root of the word is analyzed and explained. For example the etymological definition of "etymology" from Wikipedia is 

In terms of what, in brief (since it's not directly relevant to the question but it's important in order to understand what follows) a definition may be: 

By Enumeration: This kind of definition examines the logical width rather than the logical length of the underlying entity to be defined. The definition is carried out by referring to the elements of the defined set one by one. For example, we say that one-digit numbers are the numbers {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0}. Interpretational: A definition is interpretational when it analyses the semantics of the entity to be defined. For example from the free online dictionary, one definition of weight is 

Some light is detectable, but no light is visible. Visible is a term used to describe the conscious perception of visual representations within our brains visual cortex. Trees, people, words on a page, are all visible. Air is invisible. We see trees, people and words on a page, but we can't see air. Light is the reason we see things. When our eyes detect light, our brain creates visual representations of the objects from which the light originates. We see these representations. It's illogical to say we see light as light exists outside of our subjective reality. There is contention amongst physicists as to whether we perceive an object or only see the light (electromagnetic radiation) which the object emits. I propose that we see neither. Visual perception occurs in the visual cortex. What we see is neither the actual object, nor light, but a visual representation of the object. Visual perception is a process, of which, detecting electromagnetic radiation is but a part. The actual perception occurs at the end of the process. 

Determination of a number of elements that belong to the set we define A recursive rule or formula using which all other elements of the set emerge An explicit or tacit assumption that the set contains no other elements. 

Realistic: When it defines a tangible being in the sense that the definition refers to the object rather that to the word we use to describe it or its reflection in our mind (conception). Conceptualistic: When the defined being is a concept or our concept about a being. Nominalistic: When the defined being is a word and the focus is on the e explanation of the word (etymology, meaning etc) 

Analytical: A definition in which we plumb the logical depth and the essential characteristics of the underlying entity are analyzed. For example Euclid, provides the definition of surface as (Euclid, Elements, Book I) 

The idea is that if everything in the universe can be determined precisely then it's unlikely free will exists but if even the universe has different possibilities then we probably have free will too. Please note, this is not my belief, just how some people view it. 

Existence can't be proven objectively, but the simple process of questioning existence, proves existence. If you did not exist, you could not ask the question, "Do I exist?", therefore you know you exist. But proving you exist to someone else is impossible. We can postulate which is the most plausible view, but ultimately, every view relies on accepting an ultimate truth which is unprovable. 

We mark the progress of time by a thin line between past memories and no memories (the future). If time is actually flowing backwards or even standing still we would not know it. If memories are deleted one by one we would still remember a past and imagine a future so how can we be sure time is marching on? 

Usage-driven: A definition explaining the context, conditions or situations when the defined entity is used. For example: 

GPDS definition (Genus Proximum and Differentia specifica): Is a definition that outlines the key differences (Differentia specifica) between the entity to be defined and a proximal genre (Genus Proximum) in whose logical width the defined entity is included. For example: 

All these kinds of definitions appear in Science. Some of them are employed for merely pedagogical purposes. For example it is not easy to explain temperature to a primary school child as the partial Legendre transform on Internal Energy with respect to Entropy so you will concoct some less strict definition like "Temperature is the measure of hotness of a body" (Interpretational). Later on, one learns that "Temperature is the measure of mobility of the molecules of a body" (No different that the previous one - an interpretational definition). Important: It is important to understand that there in not a single way to draw definitions. Some classes of definitions might not look not Scientifically valid. Relations between classes of definitions: The provided classification of definitions covers a wide range of definition one finds in all fields of science (from mathematics and chemistry to social sciences and history) but does not necessarily cover all kinds of definitions. Moreover, this classification is overlapping in the sense that a particular definition might lie in more that a single class. As a conclusion... it's hard to give or understand a definition.
