That said, here is how I think humans would adapt: Daytime would be mostly work time, with catnaps interspersed through at the light hours. I would tend to believe that there would be easily accessible bunks in work places for people to go at naptime. Nighttime would most likely be the opposite. If we assume there would be 16 hours of darkness, I would guess that at least half of it would be spent sleeping, probably in 2 chunks. Maybe 4 hours of sleep, 8 hours of fun-time followed by another 4 hours of sleep before getting back to the daily grind. 

Sleep is strongly affected by light. The presence of light inhibits the production of melatonin, darkness encourages it. Sleeping during the day light hours would require a lot of shade. Staying awake during the dark hours would require good lighting and an extra pot of coffee. Human beings do not NEED to have all of their sleep in one stretch. Thomas Edison famously power napped instead of sleeping all at once. Ultimately REM sleep is cumulative, and if you get enough of it, it doesn't matter how you do it. 

The main reason I would see the planet moving to a light based power source would be some quantum leap forward in the technology. That is, someone has to invent the technology first, and it must be widely regarding as awesome. It must be powerful enough to take on their current energy needs. Most importantly, it MUST be cheap. In order everyone to abandon fossil fuels, this option must be super cheap to implement. There will be very rich and powerful people trying to fight its adoption. To counter those people, the cost must be such that it can be put into place and there is an immediate savings. There are certainly a ton of benefits to this type of power, but the motivating factor would be cost. For interstellar travel I would recommend looking at Solar Sails. Solar pressure pushes on large mirrors to propel the spacecraft. The interplanetary version of this is already being used, so it just needs to be upgraded with some better technology. The hypothetical interstellar version could be powered by high intensity lasers. I highly recommend reading the Wikipedia article! What is the down side to the light based power source? Is there a side effect? My first concern would if there were health consequences to the power source? Do the new power companies need to rip open the ozone layer to get better and more lucrative? Imagine that there are still plenty of ways for energy cartels to develop and exploit the system in an attempt to make more money. (Avarice is always a good motive.) Is energy distributed fairly across the masses? I hate to just recommend the classic conflict of the haves vs the havenots, but I see this world as having larger and larger skyscrapers, reaching closer to the light source. At the same time, the people down on street level are literally stuck in their shadows, getting very little light. 

A slight variation on a few other answers about the future being unclear, but perhaps the prophesy came to the prophet in a dream. Many people have difficulty remembering their dreams clearly so the result is a vague recollection, open to interpretation. You could also filter this through the psychological / emotional state of mind of the dreamer which warps the visions somewhat in the same way they would affect normal dreams. 

This is like the "Is Pluto a planet?" question. The question suggests that there may be legal implications or something here (like you get tax breaks for writing hard science?) but in the end, it doesn't matter to anyone except the taxonomists. So is your question should really be: "If I introduce a fictional science into my hard science work, will it still appeal to fans of hard science?" or "Could I live with myself if I did this?" or something similar. (I don't know the answer to either) Pluto is the exact same whether we call it a planet or not, as will your work be whether we call it hard science or not. It's ultimately up to your conscience whether you are still writing a work of hard-science, there's no need to ask us for permission. (But maybe if you preface your story with a sort of "paper" on the new discovery it might help) 

The obvious answer was that the microchip was never invented... But let's say they had computers but still no Internet. They didn't have a cold war The dawn of the Internet was in the 1960s. The idea was to have a network of computers communicating with each other and withstand attack from their enemies. If one line of communication was bombed then many others could still be used. Without this threat, and an interest in Information Technology by the U.S. government/military, there would be no Internet. And I specify the U.S. because other countries didn't develop similar technologies (so it's quite easy to see why it wouldn't necessarily happen) Now of course, what brought the Internet to the civilians was the ability for educational institutes to share data between each other, but I can't really see them having developed the infrastructure required to facilitate the Internet without the groundwork first being laid by the military. I disagree with the posts about people's fear of loss of privacy, etc. The benefits of the Internet outweigh that fear, especially during the 1980s when transmitting data back and forth was not too much different from speaking to them on the telephone in terms of privacy loss. In a parallel, no one complains by the loss of privacy generated by fax machines... And unless you were living in a repressed society where such research was expressly forbidden, there would still be the interest amongst the people actually developing it (as opposed to people who feared it) that it would still get developed. 

Plant a spy in their ship's galley! The night before the battle, he will poison the water/rum (and food if possible) on board leaving the crew too sick (or dead) to fight. If you know where they and their allies are going to be in a month, it stands to reason you already have their command structure well-infiltrated, so this shouldn't be a problem. 

What can people with the technology of 9th-10th century use to produce efficient and complex contact lenses with colored symbols on them like the use of machines is obviously excluded, I've seen glass workers that can do some incredibly awesome things by hand like this sculpture but I'm not sure if they could make something like safe and comfortable lenses or how they would color them... Or probably could they use some more comfortable materials at that time instead of glass? cause I imagine glass contact lenses could be bad for health and maybe heavy and painful. 

Given the chance to bring back from the jurassic any plant, which one would be the most adapted to survive and spread in our actual environment? 

Why would an non-Eusocial animal have a caste of sterile individuals? Formicidae and Apoidea have sterile workers,but those outnumber the fertile drones and princesses or queens. In another animal that doesn't have queens or drones but just motile(male) and oogame(female) why would evolution support and want the existence of a precise caste of sterile individuals that does not outnumber the fertile ones like in eusocial colonies? In humans and many other mammals males outnumber females cause they die more easily and have a way shorter lifespan, and this seems to work for the most part. How would the males,females and sterile be distributed in this situation? 

Consciousness is the result of the brain, a mixture of senses,memories and a complex communication between the neurons. To make an example see neurons as people, having 10 people there doesn't do anything. But if you give those 10 people something to talk about they will create a conversation, this conversation is the consciousness of the group. If one of the ten people dies and gets replaced the conversation and so the consciousness will change and lose or gain new qualities. Over time these 10 people will die and be replaced causing the conversation to deviate completely from the original group. In short, we all die slowly over time until there's nothing left of what we used to be. Replacing the neurons of a person with nanobots would be exactly like killing that person and having someone replace them that thinks to be them. another Example: 1-Jimmy is alive and knows it. 2-Every single cell in jimmy's body gets replaced by nanobots. 3-Jimmy is killed by the nanobots. 4-The nanobots give life to Jimmy-bot. 5-Jimmy-bot is alive and knows it. 6-Jimmy-bot doesn't remember about the existence of the original Jimmy therefore now Jimmy-bot became the true original Jimmy leaving the old one in the oblivion. 

How strong can the bones/plates and muscles of a humanoid be when pushing biology to its absolutely maximum limit to allow the fighter to deal the most powerful jumping knee strike physically possible without injuring itself by breaking it's own bones or plates,muscles and tendons or whatever anatomy it has. and I'm Talking about a mid range straight strike without grabs and no rotations as in the picture 

In the lord of rings the elves invented an incredibly nutritious bread/biscuit, as Legolas clearly says only a small bite is just enough to satisfy the needs of an adult man for 1 day. An adult person needs about 2000 calories per day... maybe 1600-1700 for extremely skinnny and underweight people or those who have jobs that require no physical skills. But I'm going with the 2000 calories one... obviously I mean kilocalories. Each bite of lembas needs to sustain a person so it might give 50 grams of protein, 250 grams of carbs and enough fats to avoid protein toxicity... maybe 80-85 grams of fat can make it. So how would a medieval society create Lembas without magic? Putting and compacting extreme loads of nutrients together is easy, the hard part is to make it edible and most importantly not deadly. Feel free to adjust the fat-carbs-protein ratio as you prefer but please keep it healthy and close to 2000 calories per bite. What it tastes like doesn't matter, after all is just a bite. 

Not really sure why you are struggling to come up with a reason - if a society doesn't happen to have a strong nationalist emotion, then they may think it makes sense to join. For example, a powerful empire brings advanced science, technology and economics, access to new trade partners and the resources and expertise to develop a decent infrastructure within the nation, especially if they are as you say they are "good" and aren't just there to pillage the local natural resources and make slaves of the natives. It also, as others have said, brings protection from other nearby nations and the "evil" empires. Also they might not currently have a strong king / president / dictator / government who is desperate to hold onto their position. (In fact they may well have one who is happy to have the Empire lighten the weight of their crown) Look at it this way, why do states / provinces / counties not want to break away from their federations / countries in real life? 

What about some sort of device that contains an electric motor? Turning fast enough, it would be attached to a shaft or something that would launch the projectile. 

We think certain smells are bad because they are associated with things that are bad, e.g. rotten meat smells bad to stop you from eating it, etc. Your considering a smell to be bad is your nose's way of warning you to keep away from the source because it will make you sick. So your planet and people can be identical to Earth except with the following difference: Lavender, or something that smells very like lavender is poisonous to the people who live there, but also grows common enough in the wild to be sampled by the general population. They will have evolved to retract in disgust from the smell. 

Consider this: The world is a changed place. Warfare is mechanised, and sending humans to the slaughter, to "die for their country" is no longer done - people don't stand for it any more. Battles take place between civilised organisations or even corporations, and civilian casualties or "collateral damage" is no longer considered acceptable. People no longer buy into the psychology and politics of hate, nationalism, or religious extremism. But battles still take place. The belligerents are powerful enough that governments are not able or willing to stop them, but not powerful enough that if they started killing people and destroying hospitals, orphanages and kitten sanctuaries, that they would get away with it. And battles still rage within urban areas. Now how do you approach it? You can't just start lobbing missiles and shells around because you might miss and turn the city into a wasteland. Instead, you have large lumbering mechs, armed with large melee weapons made of highly advanced pneumatics and technologium - a metal composite that is so hard and sharp that it can cut through enemy armour, buildings and machinery without damage to itself. And with no chance of stray missiles or big explosions, it minimises the risk of killing innocent bystanders. Perhaps the weapon can also be electrified, doing further damage to enemy machinery (if cutting by itself isn't enough) Edit Maybe there's some outdated law that forbids projection of a potentially lethal missile - updating the law to stop melee weapons has become tied up in the bureaucracy.
