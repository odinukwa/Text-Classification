Let $X\subset\mathbb{P} ^ N$ be a smooth irreducible complex projective variety of dimension 3 (or better yet, dimension $n$). Is it possible to express the Hilbert polynomial of $X$ as a function of the degrees of Segre classes of $X$? If so, how? Thanks. 

Let $X,Y$ be complex projective varieties with $X$ irreducible, and let $f:X\dashrightarrow Y$ be a rational map. If $U\subseteq X$ is the largest open set where $f$ can be defined, is it true that $\mathrm{codim}_{X}(X\setminus U)\geq 2$. I know this is true if $X$ is smooth. EDIT: In view of the inkspot's answer, I add: if $D\subset X$ is an irreducible divisor on $X$, with $D\cap\left(X\setminus\mathrm{sing}(X)\right)\neq\emptyset$, can it happen that $D\cap U=\emptyset$? Thanks. 

Let $X\subset\mathbb{P}^N$ be an irreducible nondegenerate (i.e. not contained in a hyperplane) projective complex algebraic variety, and let $\mathrm{Sec}(X)$ be the secant variety of $X$ (i.e. the union of all secant lines of $X$). Further suppose that the homogeneous ideal of $X$ is generated by forms $F_1,\ldots,F_m$ of degree two. How do I write the equations of $\mathrm{Sec}(X)$ as a function of $F_0,\ldots,F_m$ ? Let us focus attention on the simplest case, i.e. when $\mathrm{Sec}(X)$ is a cubic hypersurface. Then we have $\mathrm{Sec}(X)=V(G(x_0,\ldots,x_N))$, where $G(x_0,\ldots,x_N)=\sum_{i=1}^m L_i(x_0,\ldots,x_N) F_i(x_0,\ldots,x_N)$. The linear forms $L_0,\ldots,L_N$ depend only by $F_0,\ldots,F_N$, but how? Thanks. 

Let $X$ be an irreducible, generically smooth, closed subscheme of $\mathbb{P}^N=\mathbb{P}^N_ {\mathbb{C}}$ with saturated ideal $I_{X,\mathbb{P}^N}$ generated by quadrics, and let $\widetilde{\mathbb{P}^N}=\mathrm{Bl}_{X}(\mathbb{P}^N)\stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow}\mathbb{P}^N $ be the blow-up of $\mathbb{P}^N$ along $X$, $E=V( f^{-1}(\mathcal{I} _{X,\mathbb{P}^N})\cdot \mathcal{O} _{\widetilde{\mathbb{P}^N}})$ the exceptional divisor. Also let $Q\in I_{X,\mathbb{P}^N}$ be a fixed smooth quadric, $\widetilde{Q}=\mathrm{Bl}_{X}(Q)$ the strict transform of $Q$, $F=E\cap \widetilde{Q}$ the exceptional divisor. Moreover assume $\widetilde{Q}$ smooth and $F$ reduced and irreducible. My question is: Is it true that $$\exists\ \alpha\in \mathbb{Z}\ : \ f^{\ast}(Q)\sim \widetilde{Q}+\alpha\ E$$ 

I am also interested in learning Chinese and Japanese enough to read mathematical articles. While also learning basic language notions with traditional courses, I am practicing by reading small and elementary mathematical wikipedia articles in english, chinese and japanese, that I sometimes translate back with google translate to match with the english version. I making slowly my own quadri-lingual dictionary (with english and french) with an electronic card system (Anki), so that key hanzi/kanji for mathematics allow me to progressively guess the subject of an article for instance. I devote some time to writing correctly by hand each new characters many times to reinforce memory by gesture and concentration. 

What can be said of the various adaptations or specializations of this constant to various class of functions, and extensions of these constants to several complex variables or other functional spaces ? 

Its theme is the interaction of mathematical and artistic inquiries as characteristic of Western art in the Renaissance, with perspective and precise description of geometrical forms (such as polyhedra) as turning point, and embodied in several key artists such as Piero della Francesca, Leonardo da Vinci, Albrecht DÃ¼rer. The same author has written a book dedicated to Piero della Francesca: 

(too long or too complicated as a comment). There are at least two relevant properties in your problem. The part of the expression inside your initial sum that does not depend on $c$ is already equal to the result. \begin{align*}\sum _{d=0} ^{n} \frac{1}{d!(n-d)!} \frac{\Gamma (b+d) \Gamma (b+n-d)}{\Gamma (b) \Gamma (b)} = \frac{1}{n!} \frac{\Gamma(2b+n)}{\Gamma(2b)} = \frac{1}{n!}\prod_{i=0}^{n-1}(2b+i), \end{align*} a binomial sum (or a finite product if you like) you can manipulate in many ways. You succeeded in finding a one-arbitrary-complex-parameter weight expression that leaves that sum invariant. It is a very interesting property that can be exploited if one sees this sum as a discrete probability distribution. The sum without the $c$ fractions is probably a limit when $c$ approaches an integer. Another related point is that the original summand is invariant by $d\rightarrow n-d$ so you would always obtain a symmetric distribution. 

Let $X$ be a smooth irreducible threefold, and let $H$ be an ample divisor on $X$. Assume that $D$ is a divisor on $X$ such that $D\cdot H^2=D^2\cdot H=D^3=0$. Question 1: Is $D$ numerically trivial? Question 2: Is $D$ trivial? Actually, the argument at page 69 (section 3.8) in the book [O. Debarre, Higher-Dimensional Algebraic Geometry] should answer yes to the first question, but I don't understand it. (For example, it seems that he applies the Hodge index theorem also in the case of singular surfaces.) I hope someone can give me some clarification. 

Let $X\subset\mathbb{P} ^ {14} _{\mathbb{C}}$ be the image of the 2-uple embedding of $\mathbb{P}^4 _{\mathbb{C}}$ in $\mathbb{P}^{14} _{\mathbb{C}}$. What is the secant variety $ Sec(X)=\overline{ \bigcup_{x_1,x_2\in X\atop x_1\neq x_2}\langle x_1, x_2\rangle }$ of $X$? What is its degree? Thanks. 

Let $X$ be a complex irreducible quasi-projective variety, $f:X\longrightarrow\mathbb{P}^N$ a morphism, $H\subset\mathbb{P}^N$ a hyperplane, $Z:=f^{-1}(H)$ which is irreducible, $Y\subset X$ a irriducible closed subset. Clearly we have $f(Y)\cap H=f(Y\cap Z)$, is it true that $\overline{f(Y)}\cap H=\overline{f(Y\cap Z)}$? EDIT: Moreover $Y\cap Z$ is irreducible (hence not empty). Thanks. 

Let $\mathbb{F}_1$ be the Hirzebruch surface $\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{O}\oplus\mathcal{O}(-1))$ and let $D$ be the very ample divisor $3C_0+5f$ on $\mathbb{F}_1$ (notation as in [Hartshorne, Algebraic geometry, p. 373]). Then $|D|$ gives an embedding of $\mathbb{F}_1$ in $\mathbb{P}^{17}$ as a surface of degree $21$. How do I find the equations of this surface (using for example Macaulay2)? Thanks. 

Let $L=\mathbb{P}^l\subset\mathbb{P}^N$ be a fixed linear space, $l\geq0$, and let $M=\mathbb{P}^{N-l-1}$ be a linear space skew to $L$, i.e. $L\cap M=\emptyset$ and $\langle L, M\rangle=\mathbb{P}^N$. Let $X\subseteq\mathbb{P}^N$ be a closed irreducible variety not contained in $L$ and let $$ \pi_L:X\dashrightarrow\mathbb{P}^{N-l-1}=M $$ be the linear projection, i.e. the rational map defined on $X\setminus(L\cap X)$ by $$ \pi_L(x)=\langle L,x\rangle\cap M. $$ I say that (denoting by $x$ the general point of $X$): 

Let $V$ be a complex quasi-projective variety, we know from H. Whitney's and B Teissier works on stratifications of algebraic varieties that $V$ has an intrinsic stratification $$X_0\subset X_2\subset\ldots\subset X_{2n}$$ made out by complex quasi-projective smooth varieties that satisfy Whitney conditions $a$ and $b$. This stratification induces a structure of topological stratified pseudomanifold on $V$ meaning in particular that any point $x\in X_i$ has a conical chart, a stratified homeomorphism: $$\phi:U_x\rightarrow V_x\times cL$$ where $L$ is a topological stratified pseudomanifold of dimension $2n-i-1$, $cL$ is the cone on $L$, $V_x$ is an open neighbourhood of $x\in X_i$ and $U_x$ is an open neighbourhood of $x\in V$. A priori $\phi$ is just a stratified homeomorphism (for a proof one can look at N. A'Campo survey in Armand Borel et al. lecture notes "Intersection cohomology" chapter IV Birkhauser), but we can ask wether if this intrinsic stratification gives us a Piecewise Linear stratification. In 1984 A'Campo explains that this question is open for analytic spaces, I was wondering if an answer is known in the case of complex algebraic varieties. 

You should look at this paper: $URL$ and in particular theorem 3.5. And also $URL$ p. 23. It follows from the double suspension theorem and its corollaries that when $n\geq 5$ you can take for $Y^{n-1}$ any combinatorial homology manifold wich is homotopy equivalent to $S^{n-1}$, then the cone $C(Y^{n-1})$ is homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$. Take for example two homology $3$-spheres $Z$ and $Z'$ consider $Z\times [0,1]$ and $Z'\times [0,1]$, build the connected sum $W$ (just remove a $4$-disk inside $Z\times ]0,1[$ and $Z'\times ]0,1[$ and glue). $W$ is a manifold with $4$ boundary components, glue a cone on each of this boundary component, you get a space $Y$ with $4$ isolated singularities whose links are homology spheres. Thus $Y$ is a combinatorial homology manifold, it is $1$-connected (by Van-Kampen theorem) and has the homology of a $4$-sphere (by Mayer-Vietoris theorem). And take the cone over $Y$. 

Just to stress a few points already addressed in comments and answers: Euler in his time discovered many important facts and solutions to classical questions, advanced rigor and gave examples of the power of the recently created methods (infinitesimal calculus), popularized the science of his day (notably books dedicated to a German Princess), wrote some of the first textbooks in analysis (still pleasant reading today), gave strength to the prussian and russian academy of science, courtized by two of the most powerful powers of the day (the King of Prussia and the Czar of Russia), filled international academic journals, some of them he edited himself, with quality articles (in fact up to several decades after his death because of the sheer size of his output), fostered international cooperation, wrote in the most important languages of his day (latin, french, german, I think he also learned russian), published in applied science, was part of state scientific advisory commission, etc. In fact Euler's work has been instrumental in progressively establishing the "rigor" some of us are so proud of. So a better equivalent of his investigation of what we call now Zeta(2 n) and the Gamma function would be the solution of outstanding problems by one of the most recognized mathematician of his day building on recent work by one of his even more famous and established mathematician, Bernoulli, who was his PhD advisor and whose several family members have established positions in the scientific community. I think he would have no difficulty publishing it. And his work would be quickly read and commented upon by many other mathematicians. Even if we imagine a Leonard Euler finding himself straight-jacketed by the mathematical discourse and style of the XXIst century, he would pair up with another good mathematician to write scholarly articles, as Ramanujan and Hardy used to do at the beginning of the XXth in a mutually benefical couple. 

I think that what you are searching for is explained in P. May's paper "A general algebraic approach to Steenrod operations". In this paper you will find a very general treatment of cochain level cup-i product operations. In particular P. May introduces the concept of Cartan object and shows that the cohomology of Cartan object comes equipped with the action of Steenrod operations that satisfy the Cartan relations (see proposition 2.6). All the computations are made at the cochain level. The algebra of singular cochains of a topological space is a typical example of a Cartan object. Moreover, we have an operadic interpretation: 

Have you looked at Mathai-Quillen's paper: "Superconnections, Thom classes, and equivariant differential forms." Topology 25: 85-100 (1986)? Where they build a form representing the Thom class (together with some very nice properties). You can also look at: "Mathai-Quillen Formalism" Siye Wu available on arXiv(hep-th) (section 2.2). 

1) A $n$-dimensional homology manifold is a topological space $X$ such that for any $x\in X$, the homology groups $$H_p(X,X-x,\mathbb{Z})$$ are trivial unless $p=n$ where $$H_n(X,X-x,\mathbb{Z})\cong \mathbb{Z}$$ 2) A $n$-dimensional pseudomanifold is a topological space together with a triangulation such that 

Links of singularities of complex algebraic varieties are fascinating geometrical and topological objects. For example Brieskorn manifolfs. A Brieskorn manifold is the intersection of a small sphere around the origin with the singular complex hypersurface $$z_0^{k_1}+\cdots+z_n^{k_n}=0$$ they are closed smooth oriented $(nâ2)$-connected $(2nâ1)$-manifolds. They give examples of exotic spheres. The study of Brieskorn manifold and exotic spheres motivate the study of the surgerical classification of manifolds, stable homotopy groups of spheres (J-homomorphism, Adams' conjecture, Kervaire invariant.....), etc 

About learning about logarithmic integral and polylogarithm identities, there are large compendium of formulae on everything (Gradstein Ryzhik Jeffreys for instance), a few classic monographies such as Nielsen, Lewin, some new books (some of them with a physicist point of view since polylogarithm appear when dealing with Feynman path integrals among others) and also this online resource. You can print the pdf version of this list of dilogarithm identities for instance. 

For permutation polynomials, you can also look into the relevant part of "Finite fields", by Rudolf Lidl and Harald Niederreiter, CUP. 

Motif in french has both the meaning of english "motive" and of "pattern". It is still actively used in decorative arts and art history "Cette tasse est ornÃ©e d'un trÃ¨s joli motif", "This cup is decorated with a very pretty pattern", and so on for tapestry, greek freeze, wallpaper, etc. And still used when describing a police case : "Il a un alibi et n'a aucun motif". So I believe that Grothendieck was well aware of this ambiguity. 

As far as I can check, in french this issue does not arise. The only available description is "moins x" or "moins 3", corresponding to "minus x" or "minus 3". The closest equivalent of "negative x" would be "x nÃ©gatif" and it would only be used in phrases such as "pour x nÃ©gatif", meaning "for x < 0" and not as a description of part of such a formula. "NÃ©gatif" seems to me mostly used in french in a categorical way "tempÃ©ratures nÃ©gatives", "nombres nÃ©gatifs". It would be informative if native german, russian, chinese, etc. speakers could comment on this.
