Slica makes a very nice presta pump head (below), the cost in the US is around $35. For that it ought to work well – and it does. The connection is a Schrader (car tire) thread and it is a pain to find a hose barb with that thread. What I did was to cut off the end of the hose and then use the threads on the pump head as a hose barb. I put a hose clamp on it and it holds just fine. 

Q1 - Removing the damaged left cup: I think I'd do this by first removing the crank arms and the right hand cup. Then, I'd remove the axle. Once you have it all apart you can work on removing the left hand cup. Since it has a right hand thread what I think I'd do is to get an screw extractor (aka an EasyOut). You can find sets online fairly inexpensively, Harbor Freight also carries them, and your local hardware or plumbing supply store will also have them. If you're going someplace local, take the right hand cup to make sure you get the right size. With the EasyOut you'll be able to back the cup out using the hole for the axle. Q2 - Can you buy just the left cup: I'd be surprised if you could, but bottom brackets are relatively inexpensive. A descent conventional bottom bracket lists for US $30 and you can find them pretty easily discounted to about half of that. It seems likely that enough parts of that bottom bracket are damaged that it would be worth replacing the whole thing. Q3 - Should you use a thread locking compound: You could, but it's probably unnecessary. The left hand thread is self-tightening as long as the bearings are doing their job. It's a bit counterintuitive at first, but think about how the bottom bracket works. From the right hand side the crank is turning clockwise. This causes the ball bearings to turn counter clockwise, so the motion of the bearings on the outside – against the bottom bracket cup – is working on tightening the left hand thread. 

I kind of doubt it. The hub will still be 10-speed and I'm pretty sure that a 10-speed cassette is wider than a 7, so you won't get back all of the width (in fact I'm not sure you'll get any of it back). Even if you got some back, putting it into a 126 mm frame likely means that the wheel would be "over dished" (there would be a poor bracing angle on the right side spokes). It seems like you'd do better to go looking for a NOS 7-speed hub so that you could build up a proper 126 mm wheel. If the flange sizes are the same you could probably reuse the existing spokes. 

As many others have said, you're not really in the "extreme" weight range. There are many quality bikes that will do just fine. That said there are three things that are worthy of your attention: 

After that an adjustable stem like you suggested and/or bars with an upward bend will all help. Shortening the reach may also help. Keep in mind that as you raise the bars you may find that cables are coming up short. You may have already done this, but a "trick" that works for me is to "visualize" where I want the bars by riding with my fingertips or even no-hands as I look for a place where I will feel comfortable. I've found that I can get very close this way and it's a lot less work (and money) than changing parts. Once I know about where I want the bars, I buy the parts to fit. 

The only problem that you might run into with a spacer is that you'd loose the fit on the curve of the fork, so the light might be little more likely to flop to the side. I would think that a rubber or leather washer would handle that. You don't need anything as fancy as a purpose built part. Your local hardware store will most likely have box upon box of little bits of odd hardware and among them you can find spacers in various lengths, along with longer bolts if you need them. You might want to get a couple of metal washers as well to provide a solid clamping surface. Or buy the fancy mount… If I can offer advice where I wasn't asked, you might want to consider mounting the light higher or farther forward. I really don't like the shadow of the front tire that mine casts when it is mounted at the fork crown. 

I have a RFLKT+ which I use with Cyclemeter. The significant differences are the altimeter and the ANT+ bridge. The reason why I bought it was so that I could use ANT+ sensors, specifically the Garmin magnet less speed and cadence sensors. The altimeter seems to be very sensitive and enables more or less real time grade display – just in case you want to know why you're miserable climbing a hill :-) If you don't need those features, then I don't think there is a reason to by the plus version. One other thing that I'd add is that the connection to ANT+ sensors is not as robust as I'd like. I find that I have to pay attention to the sequence in which I wake up the sensors and start the app to ensure that everything works. It seems like the sensor discovery process can take quite a while (maybe as much as a minute) which adds to the aggravation. I'm not sure if this is a RFLKT+ thing, an ANT+ bridge thing, a Garmin thing, or a Cyclemeter thing… But if the fiddling with hardware and software isn't your thing this would be another reason to lean towards the RFLKT (the Bluetooth link seems much more robust). 

Some of the KoolStop pads have a ramp at the leading edge (facing in the direction that the wheel rotation comes from – i.e., towards the back of the bike) that is supposed to help sweep water and other contaminants off of the rim. If you have these you'd want to face them in the right direction if you can. Other than that and clearance I can't think of a reason why it would matter unless the pads are the type with replaceable cartridges in which case you need to make sure that the open end of carrier faces towards the rear so that the pads are pushed forward against the stop. 

I would say the first thing you want to do is to make sure that the bike fits you, as @mattnz suggest above. A bike that doesn't fit can feel quite "weird" to ride, and subtle changes in position will change the weight distribution and your ability to move easily on the bike – for example, taking a hand of the bars to grab your water bottle. Once you're comfortable on the bike, do some easy rides to get acquainted with how it handles in a situation where you're not stressed and where it is easy to recover from mistakes. I think you'll quickly figure out if you're getting more and more comfortable on the bike and familiar with they way it handles – and therefore more confident on it. Or, you're be getting clear about what you don't like about the bike… 

Your chain is worn and no longer fits the cogs on the cassette (or the single cog on the hub of a bike with internal gears or a single-speed bike). In this case the problem would usually be worse on higher gears (the smaller cogs in the rear) and under load. It probably wouldn't happen if you were pedaling gently on the flat for example. If you have a ruler it is fairly easy to check for chain wear. Just measure out 12 inches along the top of the chain, starting from the center of one roller. On a new chain the center of another roller will line up with the 12" mark exactly. As the chain wears it elongates and by the time that roller is at 12 1/8" the chain is worn out. Much beyond that and skipping can start. If the chain is very worn it is best to replace the chain and the cog(s). Your freewheel is malfunctioning. Two things could be wrong, there could be damage in the freewheel – either broken pawls or rounded/broken teeth, or corrosion or dried out lubricants could be causing the pawls to stick. The photo below, from A New Recyclist shows the internals of a single speed hub. In this case the problem would be most noticeable when you were starting to apply power, damaged pawls/teeth might also skip as power increased as well. If you have sticking pawls I would expect them to hold once they seated. Broken pawls might never seat, and broken teeth would mean that there would be small (much less than a revolution of the pedals) skips when the pawls land on damaged teeth. Sticking pawls could let you go several pedal revolutions before they catch. You might also be able to diagnose this by listening as you coast. The sound of the freewheel should be a very regular fast clicking as the wheel spins. Then as you start to pedal there should be a consistent firm engagement, perhaps with a bit of click after a moment of silence as the cog catches up with the hub. 

Bigger tires – the bigger the tire the more space you have to cushion an impact, bigger tires also mean that the load is more distributed. Since the bigger tire gives you more support you can also run a somewhat lower pressure which means that there is more flex in the tire before the rim takes the impact. The right tire pressure (especially since you may not want to change your tires). Too much pressure will make the tires hard and will transfer more of the impact to your wheels and the rest of the bike. Too little pressure means that you'll be getting pinch flats and impacts on the rims – also not good. Proper spoke tension – the spokes support the wheel, making sure that they are tight enough and evenly tensioned will ensure that the wheel is getting as much support as possible. Deeper rims – a deeper rim section will be stronger under impact. Wider will help with lateral loads. Going too wide will straighten the sidewalls of your tires and may actually reduce their effectiveness at cushioning impacts. More spokes – hubs and rims for tandems can be made with 40 or even 48 spokes, if you're already running 36 spokes and they were properly tensioned I'd be inclined to go for more spokes when you build the next wheel. 

I've been pulling them out a lot lately. They do come out easily, but only if you have the adjusters all the way withdrawn on both sides. The catch is that the adjusters (at least the ones I'm working with) can start seeming tight before they are backed out all of the way. So backing them off can be a bit of a judgment call. Update: I was doing the "holiday overhaul" on my partner's bike and I was also sorting out why the brakes were hanging up a bit (corroded cable) and noticed another thing that can make the pads harder to get out than they ought to be – the actuator arm wasn't releasing all the way because the cable was a bit too tight, so I was missing maybe 5 or 6 mm of travel when the brakes were released. Once you've got them all the way backed off and the wheel removed, pinching the tabs together and centering the pads in the caliper opening should let them come out fairly easily. Sometimes, I find that it helps to hold the pads all the way to one side and slide the one towards the center out a bit and then reverse the process. There is a pin in the adjuster that secures that pads and if you don't clear that they will hang up. Often when the pin hangs up you naturally pull out the other pad a bit. Once one pad is past the pin, pushing it towards the side and pulling the other one should be enough to get the whole assembly out. They come out with very little force. There is nothing that will stop you from pulling the pads out one at a time, just move one towards the center and pull it out, then do the same with the other one. If you do this, you're likely to leave the spring behind, but it is relatively easy to coax out with a pair of tweezers or a pointy object or even a blast of air from behind. 

I chased what I thought was a bottom bracket / crank arm clunk for quite a while before I noticed that my saddle wasn't clamped well. I'd moved it back as far as it could go (or actually a bit farther) and the seatpost wasn't able to get a solid grip on anymore due to the bend of the seat rails. I would still swear that the sound was coming from the bottom bracket… My cleats are noisy. I figured this out one day when I rode with shoes without cleats. The noise seems to be specific to the particular shoes / pedals combination. Don't have any noise with the same shoes on a different bike with the same make/model of pedal.
