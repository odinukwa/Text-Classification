What are interesting, illustrative examples of Borel sets, situated in Borel hierarchy higher than $\Sigma^{0}_{2}$ /$\Pi^{0}_{2}$? 

This gives a negative answer assuming CH. Explanation: consider R as a vector space over Q. Let A be some basis. Take any bijection A -> A + A, where + is disjoint sum. It induces a linear isomorphism f: R -> R * R. (You can think that there's a linear isomorphism between reals and complexes if that helps.) Then, if you were given a monochromatic rectangle a=(x1, y1), b=(x1+x2, y1), c=(x1, y1+y2), d=(x1+x2, y1+y2), certainly a+d=b+c. Using that isomorphism, f(a)+f(d)=f(b)+f(c) gives a monochromatic solution of quoted equation. 

Call a computable function a total function $\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$, for which there exists a Turing machine outputting arbitrary close approximation to $f(x)$ given arbitrary close approximation to $x$. 

If I understand the definitions correctly: Let $C$ be the category of pairs (V,q) where V is a vector space on a fixed field and q is a quadratic form. A morphism $f: (V,q) \rightarrow (V',q')$ is a linear map $V \to V'$ preserving the quadratic form. Let $D$ be the category of unital algebras over the field. Morphisms are linear maps preserving multiplication and identity. We've got a forgetful functor $D \rightarrow C$ that maps an algebra V to the quadratic vector space $ (V,q)$ where $q(x)=(x \cdot x) \cdot 1$. This functor has as left adjoint the Clifford algebra construction. (I'm inexperienced, so this might be plain wrong. But surely an adjoint functor is hiding here.) 

The class of all ordinal numbers $\mathbf{Ord}$, aside being a proper class, can be thought of an ordinal number (of course it contains all ordinal numbers that are sets, not itself). Then one could consider $\mathbf{Ord}+1$, $\mathbf{Ord}+\mathbf{Ord}$, $\mathbf{Ord} \cdot \mathbf{Ord}$ and so on. Does this extension of ordinals make sense/is interesting? Maybe it was described by someone? Could it go deeper - to create a "superclass" of all ordinals that are classes? 

After I met the problem, I thought about its generalization to the three-dimensional case, i.e. given $\{a_i\}_{i=1}^n = \{(x_i,y_i,z_i)\}_{i=1}^n$ to find such $m\in \mathbb Z_+, a_0,r_1,r_2,r_3 \in \mathbb Z^3$ that $$\forall i \hookrightarrow a_i \in S=\{a_0+u\cdot r_1 + v\cdot r_2 + w\cdot r_3\}_{u,v,w=0}^{m-1},\\(r_1,r_2)=(r_1,r_3)=(r_2,r_3)=0,\\|r_1|=|r_2|=|r_3|$$ which minimize $m^3$. Same approach seems inappropriate, but is there a way to solve the problem? UPD: There are specific restrictions for three lattice vectors to be orthogonal having same length. $[r_1,r_2]$ is also lattice vector which is collinear with $r_3$. Thus $[r_1,r_2]=\alpha r_3$ where $\alpha\in\mathbb Q$. But $\alpha^2=\dfrac{|[r_1,r_2]|^2}{|r_3|^2}=|r_3|^2 \in \mathbb Z\implies|r_3|=|\alpha|\in\mathbb Z$. So all three vectors must also have integer length and, according to Pythagorean quadruple article can be represented as columns in $$k\begin{pmatrix}m^2+n^2-p^2-q^2 & 2np-2mq & 2mp+2nq\\ 2mq+2np & m^2-n^2+p^2-q^2 & 2pq-2mn\\ 2nq-2mp & 2mn+2pq & m^2-n^2-p^2+q^2\end{pmatrix}$$ For $k,m,n,p,q \in \mathbb N \cup \{0\}$. 

Consider the following problem: You're given set of lattice points $\{a_i\}_{i=1}^n=\{(x_i,y_i)\}_{i=1}^n$. You have to cover it with lattice square grid having minimum possible number of nodes. That is, you have to find integer $m\in\mathbb Z_+$ and such point $a_0\in \mathbb Z^2$ and directions $r_1,r_2 \in \mathbb Z^2$ that $(r_1,r_2)=0,|r_1|=|r_2|$ and set of points $S=\{a_0+u\cdot r_1 + v \cdot r_2\}_{u,v=0}^{m-1}$ covers all $a_i$. Among all such you have to find one that minimizes number of points in the grid, i.e. $m\times m$. This problem has simple and effective solution which is, in short: (I encourage you to think of it before heading under the spoiler) 

Consider following polynomial sequence. $$\begin{cases}a_{-1}=0,~a_0=1, \\a_{n+1}=x \cdot a_n \pm a_{n-1}\end{cases}$$ Here $+$ or $-$ is taken in such a way that all coefficients in $a_n$ do not exceed $1$ by absolute value (i.e. $\forall k \hookrightarrow |[x^k]a_n(x)|\leq 1$). The sequence seems to be infinite, but what is the strict proof of it and what are the properties of such sequence? Maybe it has unique name? Also it seems that if we will write $0$ each time we use $-$ and $1$ each time we use $+$ in sequence $s_i$, there will be $2^{\lfloor\log_2 n\rfloor+1}$ sequences $s_i$ which generate correct $a_i$. Here is all $16$ possible patterns of first $15$ terms of $s_i$: 001011001011010 110100110100101 001011010011010 110100101100101 001101001010110 110010110101001 001101010010110 110010101101001 010010101101001 101101010010110 010010110101001 101101001010110 010100101100101 101011010011010 010100110100101 101011001011010 Can you see any pattern in here? Note that in the same row it is the sequence and same sequence reversed. UPD: It seems that $s_0$ does not matter (since it produces $a_1=x$ in any way) and if we consider sequence $g_i$ which generates $\{s_i\}_{i=1}^{2^{n}-2}$, its prefixes can be generated as $$\begin{cases}g_1=\varepsilon,\\g_{n+1}=g_n + (01|10) + g_n^r\end{cases}$$ where $g_n^r$ stands for reversed $g_n$. 

A semisimple braided category with duals is called modular when a certain matrix $S$ is invertible. The components $S_{AB}$ are indexed by (isomorphism classes of) simple objects of the category and one computes $S_{AB}$ by colouring the Hopf link with (representants of) $A$ and $B$ and evaluates the resulting diagram. One can show that a category is modular iff there are no "transparent" objects (objects that braid trivially with every other object) besides the monoidal unit. Is being modular a specific property, say in the category of braided categories? Is being a modular category equivalent to being the limit of some diagram or satisfying some diagram? 

If your TQFT does not extend to the circle, (EDIT: and you're willing to generalise to lax TQFTs,) then the answer is no. A reference is: $URL$ The proof goes by an explicit generators and relations presentation of the 3d cobordism category in terms of surgeries and automorphisms of surfaces. 

Let $M\colon \partial_- M \to \partial_+ M$ be an oriented, compact cobordism. Assume that there is a handle decomposition with at most one 0-handle, and denote the handle bodies by $M_i, i \in \{0,\dots 4\}$. It is known ("On attaching 3-handles to a 1-connected manifold" by Bruce Trace) that if $M$ is simply connected and $\partial_+ M$ is empty or connected, $M_4$ is essentially determined by $M_2$. Or put differently, $M$ is completely determined by $\partial_- M$, $\partial_+ M$ and $M_2$. What can we say for general $M$? Does the attaching map of a 3-handle contain nontrivial data? Are there Kirby diagrams with 3-handle attachments? (I've never seen 3-handles represented in Kirby diagrams, probably because in many cases, only their number matters.) 

In my opinion, dagger categories are not evil, but they are not categories with extra structure (in the ordinary sense) either. (I think this is what Qiaochu Yuan meant in his comment.) More specifically, I wouldn't think of $\dagger$ as a functor. Let me give a comparison. In some parallel universe, people started to study "ategories", before they studied categories. Ategories are like categories, but without composition. That is, a small ategory $\mathcal{A}$ consists of a set of objects $\operatorname{ob} \mathcal{A}$ and a set of morphisms $\operatorname{mor} \mathcal{A}$ with source and target maps $s, t\colon \operatorname{mor} \mathcal{A} \to \operatorname{ob} \mathcal{A}$. Now, suddenly people start to consider the composition of morphisms, $-\circ-\colon \operatorname{mor} \mathcal{A} \times_{s,t} \operatorname{mor} \mathcal{A} \to \operatorname{mor} \mathcal{A}$. And they demand that $g \circ f$ has the same source object like $f$, on the nose! How dare they, that's an evil concept! Maybe some other people try to find a weakened version of composition, but they fail, or their results are not as satisfying as they expected. The point is, that doesn't have to think of a category as an ategory with an extra piece of global structure. One should think of the morphisms as a set $\mathcal{A}(X,Y)$ for any two objects $X, Y \in \operatorname{ob} \mathcal{A}$, and of the composition as a map $-\circ_{X,Y,Z}-\colon \mathcal{A}(Y,Z) \times \mathcal{A}(X,Y) \to \mathcal{A}(X,Z)$ for every triple of objects $X,Y,Z \in \operatorname{ob} \mathcal{A}$. This comparison might be quite artificial, I admit. But let's try and translate the lesson to dagger structures. Definition: A small dagger category $\mathcal{C}$ consists of:
