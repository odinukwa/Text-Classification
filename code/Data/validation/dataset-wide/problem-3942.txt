I was wondering if there is a name for the second property itself of the definition, or should I just call it "the other" property? And if a function satisfies this property only, how should I call it? 

I asked a similar question at MSE, as the question seemed quite basic to me, but did not get any hint in 24 hours, except for one upvote for the question itself. I still think I am stuck with some basic understanding of irreducible and/or non-singular varieties. In $\mathbb{P}^3$ we have an irreducible variety $A$ given by two equations $tx=p$ and $ty=q$ where $p$ and $q$ are quadratic forms in $x$, $y$ and $z$ (but not $t$). We need to argue that the map $\phi(x,y,z,t)\to(x,y,z)$ restricted to $A$ is an isomorphism of $A$ into the plane variety $B$ given by $yp=xq$. It is straightforward to see that $\phi$ restricted to $A$ maps into $B$. We can further define the inverse map by $(x,y,z)\to(x^2,xy,xz,p)$ for $x\neq0$, and $(x,y,z)\to(xy,y^2,yz,q)$ for $y\neq0$. This gives us the inverse rational map for all $x \neq 0 \neq y$. What I want is to further argue that $(0,0,1)$ is not in the image of $\phi$ using irreducibility (otherwise, there is a whole subspace mapped to this point as argued below, and, unless I am missing something, the restricted map is not an isomorphism). The way I try to think about it is that if $(0,0,1)$ is in the image, then every point $(0,0,1,t)$ is in $A$. In particular, both $p$ and $q$ are missing the term $z^2$. Now, I do not have enough vision of irreducibility to conclude this argument. It seems that I miss some basic understanding which is unfortunately not provided by a book I read. I have also checked when the intersection of two quadratic forms is irreducible. I found a result where it says that if the two quadratic forms are given by matrices $A$ and $B$, then their intersection is irreducible iff $\det(A-\lambda B)=0$ has different roots (unless, again, I misread the result). Assuming this is true, and assuming that $p$ and $q$ are both missing the term $z^2$, taking $A$ and $B$ for quadratic forms $p-tx$ and $q-ty$, indeed, we have the determinant $l(\lambda)^2$ where $l(\lambda)$ is a linear function in $\lambda$. This means that the determinant equals zero at a single point $\lambda$. This seems to support my idea (that $(0,0,1,t)$ cannot be solutions if $A$ is irreducible), but the problem is that this result is not a part of what I want to use (it is from a paper I found), so I hope there is some way to argue what I want without using any additional results, but on an intuitive level. For example, by showing explicitly a decomposition of $A$ in this case. P.S. The reason I also mention non-singularity is because I do not understand exactly the relation between two notions. For example, in one place I read that an irreducible variety can have one singular point only, but at the same time I read that $V(x_0^2+\cdots+x_k^2)$ is irreducible in $\mathbb{P}^n$ for every $k \ge 1$. Then, there is another question: show that any irreducible quadric $Q\subset\mathbb{P}^{n+1}$ is rational by taking the linear projection from a non-singular point, which induces a birational map $Q-\to\mathbb{P}^n$. I saw many similar results, but they all assume that $Q$ is also non-singular, so again I am confused how exactly they use this additional assumption, or whether it is needed at all. Finally, in the question above if there was the additional assumption of non-singularity, it would probably help me. 

I am concerned about the Schrödinger equation $-x''(t)+q(t)x(t)=Ex(t).$ Here, the potential $q$ is real and quasiperiodic with frequency vector $\omega$. That is, we let $T^d$ be the $d$-dimensional torus and $\omega=(\omega_1,\ldots, \omega_d)\in T^d$ with the $\{\omega_j\}$ rationally independent, and $q(t)=f(\omega_1t,\omega_2t,\ldots,\omega_d t)$ for some continuous $f:T^d\to\mathbb R$, Equivalently, we may formulate this equation as a matrix equation instead, $X'(t)=\begin{pmatrix} 0&1\\ q(t)-E& 0 \end{pmatrix}X(t)$, where $X(t)=\begin{pmatrix} x_1(t)& x_2(t)\\ x_1'(t)& x_2'(t) \end{pmatrix}.$ There are two equivalent descriptions of a Floquet-Bloch solution, which I am having difficulty reconciling. First, we say a solution of the form $x(t)=e^{kt}(p_1(t)+tp_2(t))$ is a Floquet-Bloch solution, where $k$ is a constant and $p_1, p_2$ are quasiperiodic functions with frequency vector $\omega$ or $\omega/2$. Second, we say $X(t)=Y(\omega t/2)e^{At}$ is a Floquet-Bloch solution, where $A\in SL(2,R)$ and $Y:T^d\to GL(2,R)$. I don't see why these two are the same thing? 

Edit: I forgot to mention that each orbit in $(V,F)$ must be connected in certain cases (e.g. considering the lattice family $M_n$ as graphs). For each node $t∈T$ choose a (connected) Cayley graph $C_t=(G/G_t,E_t)$ and add its edges to $F$ so that the above formula reads $$F=\{(gG_s,hG_t)\mid g,h∈G, (s,t)∈E\}∪⋃_{t∈T}E_t.$$ Addendum: Size estimation. Assuming the node are numbered by $1,…,n$, one way to assure that each node has different cardinality is to split each node $i$ into the circle $C_{(n+3)k^i}$. So we get an exponential upper bound. However, in many cases a much smaller size can be achieved as you have to split up only as many nodes as a minimal system of generators of the automorphism group has (split up nodes instead of linking them to copies in Daniels Answer). E.g., for the complete graph $K_n$ the nodes can be replaced by circles of length $4$ to $n+4$ leading to a total size of $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}+3n$ nodes, which is polynomial. This is probably not the lower bound as it should be possible to replace certain circles by smaller Cayley graphs. 

I am trying to understand this short paper and I am getting stuck right at the end. Let $V(x)$ be $C^\infty$ and 1-periodic (that is, $V(x)=V(x+1)$). We are considering the operator $$A=-\dfrac{d^2}{dx^2}+V$$ on $L^2([0,1],dx)$ where $A$ has periodic boundary condition $f'(1)=f'(0)$, $f(1)=f(0)$. Suppose that for some $n$ even, the $n+1$st eigenvalue of $A$ coincides with the $n$th eigenvalue of $A$. We call that eigenvalue $\hat E$. In other words, there is a multiplicity 2 eigenvalue of $A$ at $\hat E$. It is known that all solutions $u\in L^2 (\mathbb R, dx)$ to the Schrödinger equation $$-u''(x)+V(x)u(x)=\hat E u(x)$$ are periodic. Let $u_1(x)$ be the solution with initial conditions $u(0)=0, u'(0)=1$ and let $u_2(x)$ be the solution with initial conditions $u(0)=1, u'(0)=0$. It is easy to find a 1-periodic function $W(x)$ in $C^\infty$ that satisfies $$\int_0^1 W(x) u_1(x)^2 dx\neq \int_0^1 W(x) u_2(x)^2 dx.$$ Let $\lambda$ be a small constant. Supposedly, when we perturb $V$ by $\lambda W$ in the definition of $A$ (that is, replace $V$ with $V+\lambda W$) we can guarantee that for sufficiently small $\lambda$ the $n+1$st eigenvalue of $A$ no longer coincides with the $n$th eigenvalue. Why is that true? The paper cites Kato's Perturbation Theory for Linear Operators as justification, but I cannot find anything there that is directly relevant. 

Let's rephrase the problem: $(Γ,≤)$ (with $G ≤ H$ iff $G=H$ or $G < H$) is a preordered set (transitive and reflexive). $<$ is not necessarily symmetric, $≤$ is not necesserily an equivalence relation. Then $R_<$ is the set of suborders that are Elements of $Γ$. For order relations the set of the principal ideals or the set principal filters form such constructions. If I'm not mistaken in a preorder the set the principal ideals ordered by set inclusion is isomorphic to the order relation that arises if you factor out the equivalence classes. An important fact is that the induced subgraph of a preorder relation is still a preorder relation. So if $G$ is an ordered set then it is $<$ representable in the ordered set of its primary ideals. For preorders we can represent an element $x$ by a set $I(x,G)$ that contains $x∈G$ and all elements $y∈G$ that are strictly below $x$ (those $y$ such that $x≥y$ and $x\not≤y$ hold). So 

Context: this is a step to the proof of Claim 3.7 in this paper (if you have access to Comm Math Phys, the published version is here). In that paper, they used the "identity" $ \tan (\theta)\tan(\varphi)=\frac{1}{\Vert B \Vert^2},$ which I am pretty sure is false (you can choose $z$ to be in the most expanding direction, in which case we have $\varphi=0$ and so the LHS is $0$). 

I understand that the KdV equation, $$u_t(x,t)=-u_{xxx}(x,t)-6u(x,t)u_x(x,t)$$ is a compatibility condition of the two equations $$\psi_{xx}(x,t)=-(u(x,t)+\lambda)\psi(x,t),$$ $$\psi_t(x,t)=u_x(x,t)\psi(x,t)+(4\lambda-2u(x,t))\psi_x(x,t).$$ In other words, if these two equations are true it implies the KdV equation. These calculations are straightforward and available in these lecture notes. My goal is to understand why the KdV equation is an isospectral evolution of the Schrödinger operator $$H(\psi)=\psi_{xx}+u\psi$$ I can see why the evolution given by the KdV equation preserves the eigenvalues of $H$. But 

I think the answer to Question 1 is yes, at least for finite graphs. Lets $(T,E)$ be a graph. You can choose a group $G$ that is large enough to do the following: For each node $x∈V$ choose a subgroup $G_x$ (called stabilizer) such that the intersection of all subgroups is $\{1\}$ and each subgroup has a different cardinality. Then you can form the graph in the following way: $$ V= \dot\bigcup_{t∈T} \{gG_t\mid g∈G\}, \mbox{ and } F=\{(gG_s,hG_t)\mid g,h∈G, (s,t)∈E\}.$$ Then each node $t$ is broken up into $|G/G_t|$ pairwise unconnected nodes. And each edge is split up into a complete bipartite graph connecting all equivalent vertices. By changing the group size and the size of the stabilizer you can ensure that any two edges in $F$ have the same valency iff they belong to the same node in $T$. For more information: 

I will comment that it is easy to show this is true if $f$ is assumed to be analytic, but it seems rather difficult if I don't have this assumption. Through some basic PDE tricks (method of characteristics, etc) it is possible to show a local version of this result: that for a fixed $x$, there is a small $\epsilon(x)$ such that $f(x,t)=0$ for all $0<t<\epsilon(x)$, but this is not good enough for my purposes. 

We use the following definition of almost periodicity given in $URL$ Given a bounded function $f :\mathbb Z \to\mathbb R$ we denote the set of translates of $f$ by $U_0$. The function $f$ is said to be almost periodic if $U_0$ is precompact in $\ell_\infty(\mathbb Z)$. For instance, all periodic functions are almost periodic. If $\theta$ is an irrational angle, $f(n)=\cos(2\pi n\theta)$ is another example of an almost periodic function. Let $\Delta_n(x)=1+2+\ldots n$ be the $n$th triangular number and $\theta$ an irrational angle. Is $f(n)=\cos(2\pi\Delta_n\theta)$ almost periodic?
