This could be understood simply as a contradiction, if the first speaker is saying that she will repay all egg purchases, and then later that she will not repay all egg purchases. Alternately, this could be understood as an example of “ad hoc” revision: a generalization was stated in such a way that it appeared to be intended as always true, but then it was later modified to address a particular case. Perhaps the first speaker didn't actually expect that anyone would buy eggs, for instance, and faced with someone calling her bluff and actually buying the eggs, she backs off from it by suggesting that all along the generalization she intended to express was actually "If you get some eggs I will pay you back unless they are brand X." One wonders whether if you returned with different eggs that she didn't want to pay for, whether she might then modify the generalization to be "If you get some eggs I will pay you back unless they are brand X or from Store Y." (And perhaps she might claim that that was the actual generalization all along, but it's clear that it was not.) This kind of modification is the hallmark of "ad hoc" reasoning. It means in Latin, "for this," because a change is made in a position to address a particular case. The change is made "for this case." Often that case is an exception to the original generalization, like "I love everyone! ... oh, right, except him ... or him ..." Here it is a way of rejecting an instance of the generalization rather than an exception to it. 

I've followed the literature for a while, and no, there aren't any strong arguments I know of against all cases of transferring genetic material between species. You've already noticed that there are some utilitarian arguments against some kinds of cases, based on risk of the unknown. But it's also clear that those don't apply to all cases. As for arguments that apply to only some cases, and yet still don't get humans involved, some are ecological, but another kind of argument focuses on the experience of the created being, where an animal is mixed with another species. It might be fun to try to add bat wing genetic material to monkeys to see if you can generate flying monkeys. But there is a real risk of creating a hybrid creature (sometimes called a chimera) whose experience of living is terrible, because it turns out wrong. Indeed, because this is such a complicated process and genetic and developmental processes are so intricate, we would likely have to create a lot of hybrids before one succeeded, and these animals might suffer considerably. Yet, this sort of argument only applies to animals, not plants or other species. Still, such arguments are worth taking seriously, I think. The other main kind of argument I know of starts from the idea that species mixing is unnatural. There are two problems with most variations on this argument: 

the intrinsic properties of things, as in "it's in the nature of copper to conduct electricity," and sometimes what is normal for them. We might say in this way that it's not in the nature of pigs to fly, and that it is unnatural for pigs to have five legs, meaning just that it is abnormal; the universe as it is, especially with respect to its own intrinsic properties, as in "Nature includes everything that exists." Here, "nature" contrasts only with what's supernatural, if it contrasts with anything at all; the parts of the universe which are not created or produced or significantly modified or impacted by humans. In this sense, it is simply the opposite of "artificial" or "artifact," which means something created by us. In this sense of nature, what we call "nature" is a subset of nature in the second sense. 

The way "The earth is flat" differs from "I'm wearing blue shoes" is that the latter sentence includes an indexical: "I." An indexical is a term that can change its reference based on the context in which it's uttered. "You" is another example, as are "this" and "nearby." Sentences containing indexical terms take on different truth-values in a more obvious way than sentences like "The earth is flat" do. But even a sentence like that can vary in truth-value. Suppose I like going to a bar called "the earth." Maybe for some reason I want to say that it's flat, not rectangular like some other bars. My point is that other than that one contains indexicals, there's no difference between the sentences in terms of the relationship between their structures and truth. That is unlike a logical contradiction, which has a structure that makes it false. A false proposition, on the other hand, as stevebot notes, is simply false, because we say that different utterances of sentences (or instances of them in different contexts) sometimes express different propositions, which are true, or false, or possibly something intermediate. 

It's anyone with the capacity to use reason to decide what to do, who decides well, and then develops good habits by repeatedly doing the right thing. ("Agent" just means someone/something who is capable of doing things. It comes from the Latin word for "doing.") Such people can use reason to act in one way or another, and thereby acquire the habit of doing things that cause them to be happy and flourishing (virtues), or the things that cause them not to be, which are vices. So to actually be virtuous such a person needs to use his or her reason and will to choose the right things to do, and thereby develop the habit of doing those things. 

I have always been struck by Russell Mittermeier's comment that when scientists Ted Parker and Al Gentry were killed in a plane crash, they "carried two-thirds of the unpublished knowledge of Neotropical biodiversity in their minds." I think that immense knowledge is in all three of those categories. So is that I can't remember how to make the toaster at my old house work. Adding in response to question-edit: I don't think there is a principled way to draw the distinction between knowledge "we learn in school" and things we don't, and I think that is a different distinction than the one between "history and science" and things that aren't history or science. What someone had for breakfast now and then has a place in academic history; what a bird has for breakfast can have an important role in science. My point is that (1) it's clear that not all scientific knowledge is on the internet, in so far as a lot of scientific knowledge isn't published at all, some has been lost or forgotten, and much remains undigitized or otherwise inaccessible. (2) The very blurry distinction between scientific or historical or otherwise putatively-important knowledge and what doesn't fall in that category means that it's impossible to answer what proportion of it is online, other than "not all."
