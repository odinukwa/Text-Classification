The friction increases the farther the meteorite moves so the energy will get higher and higher until the above mentioned happens. This would be a "non-contact-explosion".. Also the Atmosphere consists of more than one layer of different densities (lower layer, higher density) so the whole process of crashing into a wall of higher density happens several times before finally reaching earth's surface. In case 3 the meteorite will keep flying until hitting a harder surface, that would be our earth in this case. The earth is big and hard enough to absorb the energy from the impact. So the meteorite crashes and will then release it's entire internal energy, since it can't move forward anymore, which in most cases is high enough to let it explode or evaporize.. In case of a very small meteorite it might just crash without exploding, because it can withstand the energy, but will still create an impact crater. So the process when hitting the atmosphere or earth's surface is the same: A change in density causes the meteorite to release energy. At the end a little metaphor for even better understanding: You take a rock and throw it against a wall.. It crashes and will maybe create a little crater but it won't explode.. Now you take the same rock and throw it as hard as you can so it has more energy.. when hitting the wall again it will release all it's energy and explode.. Due to the walls hardness it can't move through it, of course unless the rock is is harder than the wall and fast enough.. That would be the equivalent to the meteorite hitting earth. Try the same mind experiment with the same rock being thrown at water, which would be the equivalent to the meteorite hitting the atmosphere, which can be seen as a fluid. Summarized: 

Cyclones generally drift in a westerly/north westerly direction due to the Beta Drift and Beta Effect For atlantic hurricanes the forward speeds are summarized here by latitudinal range -Average forward speed of Atlantic Hurricanes and if there is recurve(turn more northerly) they can slow down or if they cross mid latitudes they may pick up speed by interacting with mid latitude troughs. For the latitude of Midge Point, Queensland you can expect forward speeds of about 17-18 kms/hr. So this cyclone is certainly slow moving. TC forward speed There are other factors influencing cyclone tracks which include steering winds, presence of high pressure systems,etc and more recent studies have studied the influence of SST on cyclone tracks Response of cyclone tracks to SST. From this peer reviewed reference Effect of forward speed on flooding modeling studies reveal that increasing forward speed decreases flooded volumes while increasing peak surge Back to Cyclone Debbie it looks like from this blog at least Cyclone Debbie Progress the forward speed of the cyclone is probably one of the reasons for the water to be present for more than one day and making sure storm surge occurs at the same time as the high tide. 

PS: So the release of energy when colliding is what causes the explosion whether it disintegrates or not. The equivalent to 15.000 tons of TNT represents the internal energy of the meteorite that's set free. 

It's dense and hard enough to withstand the collision but will have such high increase in thermal energy due to the friction, that it starts to melt down/evaporate "slowly" while moving forward It has such a high energy and/or small density and hardness that the energy set free is high enough to let the meteorite evaporize or explode directly upon crashing with the atmosphere.. It withstands the thermal and mechanical energy arising and keeps on flying 

What Fred said isn't wrong, but I think it doesn't answer the question very well so let me add some things: First of all remember that water will always follow the gravitational force, so of course it's flowing downwards. Close to sea level the difference between the gravitational accelerations is almost zero between the spring and the sea. Also most soils on or about sea level are well weathered and thus very thick, they can absorb a lot of water. So as Fred already said those "lower rivers" are mostly just the exposed ground water table, there isn't really that one source. Now to the difference on mountains. Mostly the higher you go the thinner the soil. Since there's almost no soil there's not much water that can be absorbed. Instead it accumulates in seas until their wall breaks and the water starts to flow downwards. It will then naturally carve it's way through the bedrock. Glaciers can also carve out huge amounts of rock and when melting create rivers that flow that way. As for the "wells". I think you mean that one point where the water comes out of the mountain. Remember mountains have in most cases higher precipitation and since not much water can be absorbed well it has to come down. When the water hits the ground it seeps through cracks in the rock to the inner mountain. The chemical weathering will cause especially CaCO3 - rich rocks (carbonates) to dissolve. This will create caves (Karst) where the water then accumulates. The water "flows" within the mountain and will at some point create a little hole in the mountain from within. That's where the water then flows out and becomes a river. I think that hole would be your well. I'll add a picture for better understanding: 

Irrespective of how accepted any scientific theory happens to be it is often worth thinking about a possible experiment to test said theory and perhaps falsify it. If we wanted to do this for the theory of the greenhouse gas effect what areas are worth considering when designing such an experiment? Would we limit ourselves to just the radiative heat response of CO2 or are their wider issues we need to incorporate into the experiment? This question is NOT a duplicate as it relates to the generality of greenhouse gases and specifically asks IF we should limit ourselves to the radiative response of CO2. Therefore one possible avenue of answering could be to consider the wider issues of water vapour and methane and such an answer would be clearly outside the scope of the CO2 specific question which has been postulated as the duplicate. 

Climate science is a very exciting field to get into right now. Not only do we have a change at the top in politics in the USA and the prospect of big changes there but the new theory of a Gravity Induced Temperature Gradient is coming to the fore. I recommend researching and reading about both sides of the debate, not just the CAGW theory stuff. If the ideas of Loschmidt (c.1870's) and the recent experimental results of R.Graeff (2007) take precedence over the current consensus theories then there will be great opportunities opening up in this field for those with the right knowledge and background. Good luck with it ! 

Here is how I would do this. ECMWF's ecCodes has a tool called bufr_ls and you can use that to write the contents of that output to a text file. Then I would read that file into a scripting language such as Python and write out the contents as a GRIB file using PyGrib. You can also explore the output of bufr_dump and convert that also to GRIB if you wish. The full list of all BUFR format tools from ecCodes is given in this link BUFR tools For more information regarding either of those softwares you can reach out to their support network and then get your doubts resolved. UPDATE If you want a 100 % Pythonic solution then you can try Python-Bufr which basically wraps ECMWF BUFR 

I am looking for an explanation for this warm pool of water in the North and North East Bay of Bengal - North Bay Warm Water Anomaly. Currently the path of the sun is towards the southern hemisphere and we are in the fourth week of October. In contrast there are no warm SSTs along the North Arabian Sea. Is it possible that warm water from the equator has moved up North along the eastern wall of the Bay of Bengal ? Is that indicated by the gyres on display on the Earth Null site ? I observe that there is a warm pool along the eastern seaboard near the equator(negative Indian Ocean Dipole) - IOD Index. Is it possible to show (if my guess is correct) that there is a south to north pressure gradient that is moving warm water north(ageostrophic circulation) ? As you can see the weekly SST global anomaly as well shows a warm pool anomaly in the North Bay of Bengal. 

Diamond isn't made of organic C at all. Organic matter would rather become oil, gas, coal or dissolve entirely. C itself isn't very common in earth's mantle, but subducted eclogites and peridotites can lead to the needed C-accumulation. But also meteorite impacts can lead to the genesis of so called micro-diamonds due to the very short lasting but extreme conditions. Diamond's genesis takes place in depths from 150 up to 700km and at temperatures about 1200-1400Â°C. Those conditions were present in the upper mantle during the archaeum and hadeum, that's why mining takes places mainly in older crustal zones. You are right that volcanic activity brings diamond up to the crust and surface of the earth. This process is thought to take only some minutes... This is a very quick process so that the diamond crystal structure won't change back to graphite and it's also the reason many diamond deposits can be found in sediments. I think that should answer your question. I don't know about the diamond exoplanets, though I've heard of it.. I'd say the process that leads to this is pretty unclear, but perhaps someone has clearer thoughts or information on this. 

At the instant any atom of carbon is taken out of the atmosphere by a plant or animal and incorporated into its structure then that atom is "off the list" as it were with respect to having an effect in the atmosphere. Once in the animal/plant it may be there for eons until it becomes oil, coal,or whatever. So it is not the ultra slow conversion of organic matter to hydrocarbons that is relevant but the amount taken up by living matter on a daily basis which is sequestered into its structure. Looking at the historical record we would therefore need to think about the amount of animal and plant activity on the planet and, to some extent, its type. This is quite difficult as we only have proxy records. however as we know that CO2 is effectively plant food it seems reasonable to assume that if the proxy record shows high levels of atmospheric CO2 we might expect that fairly quickly, a few year/decade timescale, that plant life on earth would respond quickly and become very lush indeed. This is of course only one factor with respect to CO2. Past volcanic activity is likely to also be relevant. 

What extra information can be gleaned from the RHI mode that is not available with the PPI mode ? Can phenomena such as back sheared anvil be observed from the RHI mode ? Also can anvil rain be inferred from RHI mode? 

ECMWF Model Levels The above link describes the coefficients used to define the ECMWF model levels in pressure in order to compute geopotential height. Is there a similar data for NCEP reanalysis model or is the data already on pressure levels in which case the above step is not required ? To be precise I am looking for the identical data for the T62 NCEP reanalysis data(2.5 x 2.5). The NCEP reanalysis model uses the sigma vertical coordinate. The same question can be rephrased in the following manner 1) What are the values of the sigma levels and where can they be downloaded? For e.g. if the sigma level is 0.995 and the surface pressure is 1000 hPa then the pressure at the sigma level 0.995 is 995 hPa. 2) Are the sigma levels of the NCEP reanalysis model comparable to the a and b coefficients of the ECMWF model ? UPDATE The hybrid vertical coordinate of UCAR Community Atmosphere Model(CAM 3.0) describes a similar equation to that of ECMWF and has explicit coefficients A and B as shown below $p(\eta,p_s) = A(\eta)p_0 + B(\eta)p_s$ where p is pressure, $p_s$ is surface pressure, $p_0$ is a specified constant reference pressure and A and B are coefficients that specify the coordinate being used and are defined only at the discrete model levels. GOAL - I have code that uses ECMWF data as input to run a few calculations. I am looking to run the same code using NCEP renanalysis model data. Reference 

Of course the meteorite loses energy during that process and will slow down. Note that the energy is not lost but transformed. The air/rocks around the impact will have an increase in energy causing them to thermally expanse extremely fast thus creating a shockwave. This part is what you could call the main explosion. The explosion of the rock itself is also well explained with this: 

Let me see if I got your question right: You want to understand what causes the meteorite to explode? Let's explain that in an understandable way. You know that in space we have nearly an absolute vacuum thus no friction between the meteor and other particles, that's the reason it can achieve such a high velocity without melting down or exploding.Upon entering earth's atmosphere the particle density around the meteorite rises incredibly fast due to its velocity. The meteorite gets a certain resistance dependant on it's speed and size. That's like going out on a biketrip. The faster you go the more air resistance you can feel, even more so when wearing a thick jacket for example, which means a higher surface to attack. So, the meteor entered the atmosphere and collided with it. Dependant on it's density, hardness and overall energy three things can happen: 

I have got a barometer in my hall (it's supposed to predict the weather). Sure does move about a lot. You know that of course. So the answer to your question is "YES" , in fact any change in the composition of a gas mixture is likely to change its pressure (other things being equal), but the effect will be small as the other 999,600 ppm of other stuff has a rather bigger effect BUT even if the effect was a 1 or 2% change I doubt you could confirm it by measurement as the normal variation in barometric pressure day to day and hour to hour will rather swamp it. 

I am restricting my consideration, for the moment, to just the troposphere. With regard to our understanding of the GHE do we predict that an increased GHE due to increasing CO2/Water/Methane will change the lapse rate postively or negatively? The dry adiabatic lapse rate (DALR), according to my old text books, is easily calculated from the formulae -g/c, where g is the acceleration due to gravity and c is the specific heat capacity of the atmosphere. This is supposed to be a general formulae that can be applied to any planet with a solid surface and a gaseous atmosphere. So for earth is the formulae now -g/c + (GHE) or is it -g/c - (GHE)? The bracketed GHE term being specific to the atmosphere of a specific composition, e.g. including 400ppm CO2. The second part of the question then , after we have the correct sign, is how is the term (GHE) expected to vary as the CO2 (or other greenhouse gas) concentrations vary?
