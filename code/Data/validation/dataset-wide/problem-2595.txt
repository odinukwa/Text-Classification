These solve the problem of being stressed and also how to get out of it hence it is worth striving for unless you want to remain in misery. 

Some of these have been actively researched in Parapsychology. The Wikipedia link directs you to research efforts around this subject. If you are skeptical of what others have to say you can verify your self by developing the Jhanas. Also keep in mind more you long for these powers more further it becomes so your practice should be very diligent with strong sense of equanimity through out the practice. Once you see for yourself (Ehipassiko) your doubts and skepticism will disappear. 

Takes the whole body or the body as part by part and direct your attention to these parts. Initially when you feel a sensation on some part more on. When you can feel sensations throughout the body then they to divide and dicest the sensations to see them at more lower level of granularity. Since you are seated mostly be mindful of your posture and sensations it brings. Once you have been in one posture for some time you might get a urge to more. Look at these sensation. Also the texture of your cloths touching you. The touch of the atmosphere on the exposed parts of your body. Heat of cold or the environment you work in and perhaps perspiration running down your body if you perspire. And also the touch of the chair. Touch of the keys when your fingers hit the keyboard. 

Relaxing body and mind has a deep meaning though many never get to know what actually this means. What this means if Kāya (body) and Citta (mind) Lahutā. The achievement of this you can practice meditation on the wind element (expansion contraction feeling tied to inhalation and exhalation process) or passing you consciousness or attention in a zigzag manner though any heavy, gross, solidified or painful areas or just simply being consciously aware of the sensation in itself. Also developing continuous and recurring attention on a particular object might be of help as this creates bodily pleasantness when closing on the the Jhanas. Also smiling mildly helps as it creates pleasant feeling in the body and mind. Also though during meditation you have to cut out thought (Vachi Sankhāra) and concept proliferation (papañca). This is not the same as the mind going blank but more towards developing: 

Animate being are created through Dependent Origination, Nutriment, etc. The Buddha's teaching is for such beings. The part is morality, concentration and wisdom. Even this laws may engrain morality I am not sure if concentration and wisdom can be developed by a robot. A robot may have memory of the teachings but cannot practice. So robot cannot become Buddhist by practice. 

For stream entry to happen you have to go beyond the realm of mind and matter (Nirvana). Momentarily your faculties stop working you enter into Nirodha Samapatti / Phala Samapthi. When going in to this stake you see the links of Dependent Origination in the forward direction and when you come out of it you see it in the reverse direction. Depending on the intensity of your experience you enter into some stage of sainthood. If it the weakest it is stream entry. Before you enter into Niroda you have to extinguish all Sankara leading you to births in the lower realm through Vipassana. Once you experience Nirvana your mind is at the sate that you cannot do any Karma giving birth in the lower realms (falling away of the 3 fetters) and you have eliminated all your store of Sankara which leads to birth in the lower reams hence you cannot be born in any of the lower realms. (This is as per interpretation in the Ledi Sayadaw linage.) 

Lets take our current life to stat with. We do not remember everything. We have few memories of what we did as a toddler. Next to none of our 1st year and when we were in the womb. Our memory fades. Very few people just remember their past life. By shaping our mind we can start to see back into the future remembering more of things, especially if you develop Jhanas. Since at the point of death and rebirth there is a strong break from the material body remembering things beyond is difficult without Jhana through there are some who can do it. 

Love and hatred is rooted in craving and aversion. In essence they are related as they take opposite polarity or dualism like the 2 sides of the same coin. It is so easy that things you crave for turns into aversion and vis versa. Generally is it people who were once close and deer who become foes as their shortcomings hurt the most. Also when foes to reconcile they are more friendly as they have an inclination to make up for the past. When you do not get the thing you love the most you get the most upset. Both these are roots are associated with negative consequences, i.e., suffering follows. The methods to address this is to you have to cultivate non attachment and non hatred and finally let go of them also. Non attachment and non hatred led to positive consequences but still you are in Samsara. 

Give not importance to any of these experiences. They are just conditioning. If you give importance of have prejudice towards any meditative experience, you might end up generating aversion and craving. What these experiences could be: 

Buddhism does have some theory but this is about how to practice. As you lean do more and more meditation. A retreat at some point maybe valuable to boost your practice. 

I do not see why a company should not do proper tax planning. Any sensible person / entity should do it as you should protect your earnings from various elements including the King (Government). As you said tax evasion is the issue as it is not legal. Buddha mentioned you have pay your taxes (Raja Bali) also. This should be within the bounds of the law hence as tax planning is not illegal hence it is acceptable to protect one's hard earned money. In case of a corporation, the shareholder's wealth. Following on Right Livelihood touch based on some of these issues. 

You are doing Kayanupassana hence this is one of the solution is being mindful, i.e., mindfulness of the body. In addition be mindful of the bodily sensation when moving like the fabrics touching your body, the wind sweeping over your skin, etc. Also look at muscular pains and pain and pleasure in changing postures. Ultimately what you have to work with is to realise 4 Noble Truths and Dependent Origination this you can realise through any experience you perceive as good, bad and neutral and this leads to sensation which are pleasant, unpleasant and neutral and even the pleasant and neutral are unsatisfactory due to 3 Characteristics while unpleasant is unsatisfactory on its own and neutral opens us for further existence and it can still give unpleasantness in the future. 

In essence what you are doing is you are evaluating some one desirable or ugly and developing craving and aversion to the present and unpleasant sensation that follows. This processes should stop whereby you are equanimity knowing the arising and passing nature of the arisen feeling. Now coming to what is wrong with it: 

Cessation of Name-Form by starving yourself. It is by understanding how consciousness arises due to fabrication. Karma / fabrication are formed from activities. This again can be overcome by not generating unwholesome roots, i.e., be equanimous to sensation seeing their impermanence. See: 

Among the 40 meditation subjects loving kindness meditation has the benefit of sleeping easy. Hence this is the best meditation to help with sleep. 

The simplest definition of a Jhana I found in Abhidharmartha Pradipika (vol 1, p 71): collect and focus your wondering mind so it is not wavering and stays with the object to be so it is conducive to closer examination such that all properties of the examined known in detail. (Translation is mine hence may not be perfect.) If you go by the 5 fold classification of Jhana and 4 Arupa Jhana and Niroda Samapatti the maximum you can come up with is 10 Jhanas though traditionally this is 8 plus Niroda Samapatti. 

Wisdom and awareness helps you make the choice. Being aware you can exercise restraint when your habitual or reflexive response is suffering and this is not the most conducive action to follow though with for the given situation. Wisdom aids to you asses the situation in the right frame (right angle or right light). 

As I see it some of the links are bidirectional while some links like between sensations and craving (the place you can break the cycle) unidirectional. If craving there should be sensations but in a liberated person thought he experiences sensations there is no craving. 

The object of calm can be conceptual object or one relating to ultimate realities (rupa, citta, cetasika and nirvana). If it is relating to ultimate realities then insight also develops. Insight is based on meditation on the ultimate realities. The practice to understand the nature of the realities is through Satipatthana which are: 

Giving too much importance or attachment to any experience either actual or delusional will lead to metal instability and perhaps delusion. So if you experience something then congratulations, this is great, but leaving it aside continue your practice. Reason being distinguishing real and delusional experiences is very difficult can can be futile in some instance, hence not worth giving too much importance to. I would personally err in the side of caution can consider many of such experiences as just mind playing tricks. When you stop paying attention after some time then these experiences may pass away. Best is you continue the practice giving less importance of trying not to read into too much on what you experience. 

There are instances where this also has succeeded. E.g. Mahatma Gandhi's fight for Indian freedom was done on total non violence and also won. In Sri Lanka there is a saying which says if someone is continuously attacking you when you are compassionate you are a fool. If you keep attacking someone who always compassionate you are a fool. In this light some middle road perhaps might be chosen, and depends on the situation, the opponent, etc. Also might be of interest: The Buddha and the Four-Limbed Army: The Military in the Pali Canon - Matthew Kosuta Ph.D. 

Pahāna Sutta This also does not mean you should stay with the painful sensations only as you will miss the more subtle sensation but they need to be also felt. 

Aggañña Sutta covers the Buddhist perspective on evolution. Darwinian theory covers the evolution from the perspective of the evolution of physical creatures with corporeal bodies. Aggañña Sutta takes this further and discusses this how the world system forms and how being with finer material bodies from higher places come to take corporeal form. More on this see the discussion of Piya Tan's commentary on Aggañña Sutta. Related Suttas include: 

Buddhism is compatible as there is no notion of an almighty. Buddhism revolves around the practice of Morality, Control over the Mind and Wisdom. So it is compatible regardless of what you call your self. May it be a Atheist, Christian, Muslim, etc. 

This is right. Anapanasati Sutta mentions about discerning long or short breaths as the 2nd step in the 1st triad. 

Madhu,piṇḍika Sutta Most proximate cause for thoughts to arise is perception. But what decides whether it is unwholesome or wholesome is feelings. So see thoughts arise be mindful of feeling and perception. Knowing these only will help you know what you are about to think about. Feelings will decide the wholesome / unwholesome root and perception will refine it with past experiences, memories, mental model to your intended action. Thinking about or thinking and pondering will lead to planning out the action in more detail. Also: 

The whole scene shere is unsatisfactory. The impermanence and non self nature contributes to this also. 

The working of Karma is complex. This can be Karmic, genetic (Bija Niyama), random (Dhamma Niyama - other cosmic laws). Karma can very well play a part, but we could only just speculate. Roughly only 1/5th of all experiences are due to Karma, the rest constituting other Niyama Dhamma. Only a fully enlightened Buddha may know the answer for sure. But if this helps in dealing with the situation perhaps it can be used to console your mind. See: Niyama, Karma in Buddhism 

The form may not be fully developed but the Dependent Origination (DO) continues to work. E.g. in the formless realms DO continues to work though there is no form at all. There is no difference what ever stage of life you are in. DO continues to work until you are either in Niroda Samapathi or pass away as a Arahath. 

Buddhism will be an enhancer for any social order may it be capitalist or otherwise. The reason being is when you start practicing Buddhist your moral base and value system will go up. These are the 1st grouping in the Noble 8 Fold Path or the 1st item in the 3 Fold Training. In society we have contacts and a legal framework to support enforce social order with relations to commerce. This process will become more efficient. In Business (or in any other matter also) decision making should be well balanced proactive than reactive. The next two items in the Buddhist practice will help towards cultivating this since you will develop a balanced and controlled mind. Right decision making without / reduced hate or greed will mean there will be no excesses. This does not mean to accept austerity which intern will in reducing consumption and bringing down the economy. People will live within ones means. Also the Buddha preached you should generate wealth though right means and put strong efforts to earn and protect your hard earned wealth. If you so not have some comfort as a householder you will not practice the Dhamma. Lack of greed should not viewed to reducing the effort to progress, but it is the lack of grasping / attachment to the outcome and reacting to it. E.g. you have Rolex and it break the question is whether you have a hurt feeling or sensation in you or not. It does not mean that (as a lay person) you should not have one if you can afford one. Buddhism will help towards better and well organised society as a whole what ever system may it be Capitalist or otherwise. As a final note in Buddhist literature reference to economy, social order and finances appear before Dhamma. (Always Artha then followed by Dhamma). Historically in Buddhist Culture (may be in even Hindu Culture also) it is accepted you have to give prominence to Artha before Dhamma. Without Artha you cannot do Dhamma. May reason behind breaking morality and ethics is the lack of prosperity. So always you have to aim for prosperity then morality will be easy. Also generosity and charity (Dana) will help towards building a better socially as a whole. If you look at America which is one of the most capitalist countries, there is a lot of charities and charitable activities. These will also become more streamlines, efficient and effective in a Buddhist context.
