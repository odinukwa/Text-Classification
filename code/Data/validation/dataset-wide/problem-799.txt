130 mm of aperture is definitely enough for a lot of fun. Jupiter will show off its equatorial belts. On a good night you will begin seeing swirls in between the belts - I did that with 150 mm of aperture when seeing was good, and you're within a rounding error from it. You will also see the 4 big moons of Jupiter, but only as little dots. Use medium-high magnification, don't push it too high, because Jupiter is low contrast and it washes out easily at high mag - just try and see what works best. Give it time and allow your eye to adapt. I believe your scope can track, so enable tracking, relax, breathe calmly, and just take the image in over time. In a couple minutes, your brain/eye system will begin to adapt, and you'll start to see more details. Allowing some time to pass is especially important with low contrast objects like Jupiter, where details are so close to the eye's performance limits. Saturn will show you the Cassini division in its rings. You will also begin to see some equatorial belts on the planet, but just barely. High magnification is useful, but not necessarily the highest. Mercury and Venus will show phases like the Moon, but no details beyond that. Mars can be observed for a few weeks every 2 years, at oppositions; there's a big opposition this year (2018) in the summer. It requires the best seeing (the most stable atmosphere), excellent collimation, and the shortest eyepiece (highest magnification) your telescope will take. Whichever polar cap is pointing at you should be visible, as a tiny white dot sitting on the edge. I have seen the Hellas Basin as a large, bright, white spot when it was full of frost or fog (not sure which), but it melts away quickly. Syrtis Major is probably easiest to see, as a dark, almost black line. $URL$ When seeing (air turbulence) is bad, Mars just doesn't work; it looks like an orange pill with no details. Either take a road trip to whichever part of the country has better seeing at that time, or use lots of patience. Uranus and Nepture can definitely be seen in 130 mm. At high magnification, you will see them as tiny disks, clearly (but just barely) bigger than any star nearby. Uranus is a pretty blue-green shade, Neptune is a deep blue, almost indigo. The Moon will provide endless entertainment, because there's so much to see. Zoom into a feature using high magnification, or zoom out and observe the whole thing at low magnification - it's fun either way. 

Okay, now here are the main types of instruments that you're most likely to encounter: NEWTONIAN REFLECTORS IN GENERAL (DOBSONIANS IN PARTICULAR) Many people will say "just get an 8 inch dob as your first scope", and that's usually correct. This design gives the biggest aperture per price. Biggest bang for the buck. It scales up easily to very, very large sizes. It's the ideal instrument for observing the "faint fuzzies" (nebulae, galaxies). It's great for learning, because you can easily observe its guts. When seeing is good, a large dob will open up the sky for you - you can crank up the magnification a lot (depending on aperture). On the flip side, due to the low price, you will see many dobs out there that are shoddily made. You need to remember two things with a dob: collimation, and thermal management. Collimation means keeping all the optics aligned. The mirrors will move a little, due to the way a dob is built, and they'll lose collimation. So don't forget to re-adjust it once in a while. In time, you'll get so good at it, you'll give it a two-minute quick adjustment every time you observe, and it'll be good to go; that's what I do. This is why collimation is important: $URL$ This is a good introduction to newtonian collimation (which is a vast topic, you could write a whole book on it): $URL$ Thermal management means keeping the scope at the same temperature as the ambient air. If you don't do this, internal convection will destroy the image. This is why: $URL$ $URL$ Small dobs (up to 6...8"), just take it outside at least 1 hour before you observe - or better yet, 2 hours. Let it "breathe". Dobs 10" or larger, you MUST use a fan on the primary mirror to force cooling. REFRACTORS These instruments are very convenient and very low maintenance. Take it out of the box, and it's good to go. It's collimated from factory, and it doesn't care about thermal issues. A refractor makes a great "travelscope", and a great grab-and-go scope. On the flip side, they are the most expensive, in terms of how much aperture you get for the money you spend. And they are typically made in small apertures; most commercial refractors are not bigger than 6" or so; those that are bigger are extremely expensive. The small aperture limits the maximum performance of these instruments. There is this myth out there that refractors are somehow magically better for planets (and other high-resolution targets), whereas dobs, even very large ones, are not so great. This is false; load up the designs in Zemax, do a basic performance analysis, and you'll see that aperture is the dominant factor, with everything else being secondary. But there are several reasons why this myth is around, and it's instructive to see what these reasons are: 

Is a nearby stellar explosion going to increase instability in its about-to-blow-up companion, or is it going to reduce its chances of exploding? The answer is not trivial. Bottom line: I wouldn't say it's mathematically impossible, but it's a combination of quite unlikely scenarios. In a "normal" galactic neighborhood like ours, it's never going to happen. 

Accuracy relative to other authors is hard to estimate. However, here's a scholarly article that shows a modern determination of the actual accuracy of Brahe's measurements in absolute terms: $URL$ The conclusion is that it depends on the instrument and it depends on the actual measurement, but as a general rule he was able to obtain an accuracy better than 1 arc minute, often down to 0.5 arcmin. For comparison, the resolving power of the healthy, young, average human eye is around 1 arcmin. So Brahe was able to somehow make measurements with an accuracy better than the smallest details resolved by the human eye, even though there were no magnifying instruments available in his time. I believe this was achieved by averaging multiple measurements. In other words, he was very near the limit of what was theoretically achievable before the invention of the telescope. He was certainly the best of his era by a large margin, and far better than distant predecessors such as Ptolemy. What mattered here was the methodology, and the unprecedented scale of the instruments (the armillary sphere, etc). 

Alternatives to hex tiles could also be square tiles, or triangle tiles. These are worse than hex tiles for all the reasons shown above - the corners have sharper angles which make everything more difficult. The blunt angles of the hex tiles alleviate these issues somewhat. TLDR: Non-round mirrors are hard to make anyway, but hex tiles are less hard compared to the alternatives. 

You're probably asking the wrong question - which I am going to answer anyway, and after that I am going to answer the question you should have asked instead. 

It's complicated: What is a singularity? What is at the center of a black hole? Specifically regarding space-time 

Telescopes operating at ground level are limited by atmosphere in several ways. One is the so-called "seeing", or air turbulence. This blurs the image and reduces the effective resolving power. Since small telescopes have less resolving power to begin with, they are less affected. A 100 mm aperture is unaffected most of the time. A 200 mm aperture is affected most of the time. Your telescope will be above the atmosphere, so the effects of seeing will be zero. It will operate at full resolving power all the time. Another way the air influences telescope is via light pollution and other forms of luminescence and reflected light from the air. This reduces contrast and "erases" the faintest objects from the image; bright objects such as planets are not affected at all. Your telescope will not be affected by light pollution, so its performance on faint objects (such as galaxies or nebulae) will always be 100% of the maximum for that aperture. Bottom line: you are going to have a pretty small telescope, but operating completely free of the effects of the atmosphere. 

For the largest practical e.p., don't worry about it. The Moon is so bright, losing light is not something you should pay any attention to at all.
