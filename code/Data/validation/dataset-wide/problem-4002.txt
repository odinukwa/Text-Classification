I think the following works: Looking at the book enumeration of finite groups, We obtain that the number of groups of order $p^k$ is at least: $$\frac{p^{\frac{2m^3}{27}}}{p^{\frac{2}{3}m^2}}$$ We also obtain that the number of groups of order $n$ is: $$n^{\frac{2\mu^2}{27}}n^{\mathcal O(\mu^{3/2})}$$ where $\mu$ is the largest exponent for a prime power dividing $N$. So take a natural $N$, and suppose that $2^m$ is the largest power of $2$ not exceeding $N$, we obtain that the number of groups of order $2^m$ is at least: $$\frac{2^{\frac{2m^3}{27}}}{2^{\frac{2}{3}m^2}}=\frac{(2^m)^{\frac{2}{27}m^2}}{(2^m)^{\frac{2}{3}m}}\geq\frac{N^{\frac{2m^2}{27}}}{N^{\frac{2}{3}m}2^{\frac{2m^2}{27}}}\geq \frac{N^{\frac{2m^2}{27}}}{N^m}$$ On the other hand, if $n$ is an odd integer less than $N$, clearly its $\mu$ is at most $m\log_3(2)+1$. For large values of $m$ we can just bound this by $\alpha m$, for some pre-selected $\alpha<1$. So the number of groups of odd order is : $$N(N^{\frac{2\alpha^2 m^2}{27}}N^{\mathcal O(m^{3/2})})$$. So the fraction between the number of groups of order $2^m$ and the number of groups of odd order less than $N$ for large $N$ is at least: $$\frac{N^{\frac{2m^2}{27}}}{N^mN(N^{\frac{2\alpha m^2}{27}}N^{\mathcal O(m^{3/2})})}=N^{\frac{2(1-\alpha^2)m^2}{27}-\mathcal O(m^{3/2})}$$ Which clearly goes to infinity. 

Let $A$ and $B$ be $C^*$ algebras, and let $\pi:A \odot B \to B(H)$ be a $*$-representation of the algebraic tensor product on a finite dimensional Hilbert space $H$. Let $x \in A \odot B$. Since $H$ is finite dimensional, by general theory $\pi$ factors through the minimal tensor product $A \otimes_{\mathrm{min}} B$ and hence for every $\epsilon > 0$ there are Hilbert spaces $H_1$ and $H_2$ and $*$-representations $\alpha: A \to B(H_1)$ and $\beta: B \to B(H_2)$ such that $||(\alpha \otimes \beta)x|| \geq ||\pi(x)|| - \epsilon$. I would like to know how to explicitly construct such $\alpha$ and $\beta$ given $\pi$. 

Let $\lambda( \cdot )$ denote Lebesgue measure on $[0,1]$. Let $(A_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ be a decreasing sequence of Borel subsets of $[0,1]$ such that $\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty A_n = \emptyset$. Given $\epsilon > 0$ does there exist an open set $U \subseteq [0,1]$ such that (i) $\lambda(A_n \setminus U) = 0$ for some $n$, (ii) $\lambda(U) \leq \epsilon$, and (iii) $\lambda(\partial U) = 0$, where $\partial U$ is the boundary of $U$? I don't have a good intuition whether this should be true or not. One idea might be to cover some $A_n$ by an open set with measure much smaller than $\epsilon$, then hope that we can expand that open set somewhat to make its boundary null. 

I am also interested in formulas for the expected length if the initial vertex is chosen uniformly. Thank you kindly. 

The stirling number of the second kind $S(n,k)$ counts the number of partitions of the set $[n]$ into $k$ non-empty parts. I found a definition for the numbers called the $r$-associated stirling numbers of the second kind in wikipedia. These count the number of partitions of $[n]$ into $k$ non-empty parts such that all of the parts have at least $r$ elements. They seem to be "not too hard to calculate" via the recursion: $S_r(n+1,k)=kS_r(n,k)+\binom{n}{r-1}S_r(n-r+1,k-1)$. I am interested in a very similar construction, for which I have been unable to find any references. I would like to count $F_r(n,k)$ defined as the number of partitions of $[n]$ into $k$ non-empty parts so that each of them has size $r$ or less. Most of all I am interested in $\sum\limits_{k=0}^nF_r(n,k)$, basically the number of partitions of $[n]$ into parts of size $r$ or less. Thank you very much in advance Regards. 

Let $T$ be a measure preserving transformation of a standard probability space $(X,\mathcal{B},\mu)$. A partition $\alpha$ of $X$ is said to be a generator for $T$ if the smallest $T$ invariant $\sigma$-algebra of measurable sets containing the pieces of $\alpha$ is all of $\mathcal{B}$. Suppose there is a generator $\alpha$ for $T$ and a finite set $F \subseteq \mathbb{Z} \setminus \{0\}$ such that $\alpha$ is measurable with respect to $\bigvee_{n \in F} T^n \alpha$. Does this imply that $T$ has zero entropy? 

Let $\epsilon > 0$. I would like to know if there exists $c < \infty$ such that for all $d \in \mathbb{N}$ the following holds. If $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$ let $N_x$ be the standard Gaussian centered at $x$. Let $\mathcal{V}$ be the subspace of $L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$ spanned by the vectors $\{N_x: x \in \mathbb{Z}^d,||x||_2 \geq c\}$. Then the $L^2$ norm of the orthogonal projection of $N_0$ onto $\mathcal{V}$ is less than $\epsilon$. I am also interested in the version of this question where the functions $N_x$ are the normalized indicators of balls of radius $\sqrt{d}$. An idea that might be useful is as follows. In order to obtain the desired bound, it suffices to bound the norm of the projection onto the closed span $\mathcal{W}$ of $\{N_x :x \in \mathbb{R}^d,||x||_2 \geq c \}$. Since both $N_0$ and $\mathcal{W}$ are rotation-invariant, the projection of $N_0$ onto $\mathcal{W}$ must be rotation-invariant. Intuitively, this suggests that the projection should be a positive scalar multiple of $f = \int_{\mathrm{O}(d)} u \cdot N_{\overline{x}} \, \mathrm{d} \sigma(u)$ where $\sigma$ is the Haar measure on the orthogonal group $\mathrm{O}(d)$ and $\overline{x} \in \mathbb{R}^d$ is any fixed point with $||\overline{x}||_2 = c$. Now, $\langle N_0,f \rangle = \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} N_0(x) f(x) \, \mathrm{d}x = \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} N_0(x) \left( \int_{\mathrm{O}(d)} u \cdot N_{\overline{x}} \, \mathrm{d} \sigma(u) \right)(x) \, \mathrm{d}x \\ \int_{\mathrm{O}(d)} \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} N_0(x)( u \cdot N_{\overline{x}})(x)\, \mathrm{d}x \, \mathrm{d} \sigma(u) \\ = \int_{\mathrm{O}(d)} \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} (u \cdot N_0)(x) N_{\overline{x}}(x) \, \mathrm{d}x \,\mathrm{d}\sigma(u) \\ = \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} N_0(x) N_{\overline{x}}(x) \, \mathrm{d}x \leq \delta(c)$ where $\delta:[0,\infty) \to [0,\infty)$ is a function independent of $d$ with $\lim_{c \to \infty} \delta(c) = 0$. Let $p$ be the projection of $N_0$ on $\mathcal{W}$ and let $\alpha > 0$ be such that $p = \alpha f$. We have $||p||^2 = \langle N_0,p \rangle = \langle N_0,\alpha f \rangle \leq \alpha \delta(c)$. Since $||p||_2 \leq 1$, we have $\alpha \leq 1/||f||_2$. Thus one would need to show that $||f||_2 > \beta$ for some absolute constant $\beta > 0$, as well as confirming the hypothesis about $f$. 

Let $X,Y$ be a bipartite graph and $X',Y'$ be two subsets of the vertices. Is there a Hall type theorem for the existence of matchings saturating both subsets simmultaneously? Clearly necessary conditions are for a saturating matching to exist in $X'\cup Y$ and $X\cup Y '$ but I don't know if this is sufficient. 

As a bonus question in an exam we were asked to find compact metrix spaces $X,Y$ and $Z$ such that $d_{GH}(X,Y)=d_{GH}(X,Z)=d_{GH}(Y,Z)>0$. The proposed answer is to take $\{0\},\{-1,1\}$ and $\{-1,0,1\}$. And the distances can be easily calculated by trying all appropriate correspondances and calculating distortions. However I proposed the following three sets ( there are only two radii and they are $R>r$) 

I would like to know information regarding the function $h(n)$ where $h(n)$ is the number of hamiltonian cycles the graph $K_n$ has after removing the edges that make up a hamiltonian cycle of $K_n$. Thank you very much in advance. Regards. 

Given an injective linear map $T$ between Banach spaces $X$ and $Y$, let \begin{equation} d(T) = \sup \left \{ \frac{||x||_X}{||Tx||_Y}: x \in X \mbox{ is nonzero } \right\} \cdot ||T||_{\mathrm{op}} \end{equation} Let \begin{equation} c(X,Y) = \inf \Bigl\{ d(T): T \mbox{ is an injective linear map from } X \mbox{ to }Y \Bigr \}. \end{equation} Let $\ell^p_n$ be $\mathbb{R}^n$ with the $p$-norm and let $\mathcal{H}$ be an infinite dimensional Hilbert space. I would like to know if $c(\ell^1_n,\mathcal{H}) = O((\log n)^k)$ for some $k$. Alternatively, is it the case that $c(\ell^p_n,\mathcal{H}) = O_p((\log n)^{k(p)})$ for every $p > 1$? There is a lot of literature about the Banach-Mazur distance but I have been unable to find information about linear embeddings (rather than isomorphisms). On the other hand, there is a well known result of Bourgain which asserts that a metric space with $n$ points can be embedded in $\mathcal{H}$ with distortion $O(\log n)$, but I don't know if this can be done in a uniform linear way. 

Let $E_n$ be the number of isomorphism classes of groups of even order at most $n$, let $G_n$ be the number of isomorphism classes of groups of order at most $n$ and $T_n$ be the number of isomorphism classes of $2$-groups of order less than $n$. I think that it is an open problem if $\frac{T_n}{G_n}$ approaches $1$, so I figured that it is probably not so hard to prove that $\frac{E_n}{G_n}$ approaches $1$, although I was not able to do so. 

Good evening, I am currently taking a class which has combinatorial designs as the first topic, we are using Peter Cameron's book Designs, Graphs, Codes and their Links which I am finding extremely interesting. I am really interested in a rigorous study of combinatorial designs without their links now.Of course I plan to continue taking the class, but I would really like to read a textbook just on designs (I am especially interested in realizable designs (like the social golfer and Kirkman girl problem)). Thank you very much in advance. Regards. 

Let $S$ and $T$ be commuting measure-preserving transformations of a standard probability space $(X,\mu)$, so $S$ and $T$ define an action of $\mathbb{Z}^2$ on $(X,\mu)$. I am wondering about sequences of finite subsets $(F_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ of $\mathbb{Z}^2$ which are $L^p$-good for the pointwise ergodic theorem in the sense that for every $f \in L^p(X,\mu)$ the limit $$ \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{|F_n|} \sum_{(m_1,m_2) \in F_n} f(S^{m_1} T^{m_2} x) $$ exists for almost every $x \in X$. If $(F_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ forms a tempered Folner sequence, it is well known that $(F_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ is $L^1$-good. I would like to hear what is known about analogs of Bourgain's subsequential ergodic theorems - i.e. the case where the $F_n$ are quite sparse. Specific examples of interest are $$F_n = \{(m_1^2,m_2^2): 0 \leq m_1,m_2 \leq n \},$$ more generally $$F_n = \{(p(m_1),q(m_2)): 0 \leq m_1,m_2 \leq n \}$$ for two polynomials $p$ and $q$ with integer coefficients, or $$ F_n = \{ (p_1,p_2): p_1 \mbox{ and } p_2 \mbox{ are among the first } n \mbox{ primes } \}.$$ There doesn't seem to be anything about this in Nevo's extensive survey 'Pointwise Ergodic Theorems for Actions of Groups' from the Handbook of Dynamical Systems.
