Yes, the arms should support some of a rider's weight. However, outside of a hard effort, the hands should be light on the bars and the arms should be relaxed. I'm reminded of a brief quote from Wheelmen, 

Making sure your hands and arms are loose helps to not only take pressure off your hands, but it also can help keep your shoulders and breathing more relaxed as well. Try riding with a tense upper body for a long period of time and you will see the difference. Therefore, while it probably isn't feasible to do for long periods of time, you should be able to remove your hands from the bars while continuing in the same position you just were (leaning forward, but not sitting up). 

In addition to improperly tuned derailleurs, drivetrain slippage may also be caused by a worn chain or cassette. Worn Chain: One way to check whether the chain is worn is to use a chain wear indicator. They're cheap and easy to carry with you, but if you'd rather not buy one and if the rental place has a repair shop, you could ask to either borrow theirs or see if they could check the chain wear. You would use that tool by placing it in the chain like this: 

The issue with having brake levers which have travel that ends very close to the bars is that, as the brake pads wear down, the brake levers will hit the handlebars before the brakes are fully engaged. This can be mitigated by regularly inspecting your brake pads and adjusting the brakes to compensate for normal pad wear. You could have them that close if you stayed on top of the adjustment demands, but since the average rider does not adjust their brakes this frequently or pay as close attention to this, common advice is to avoid having the levers too close to the bar. 

I have jokingly talked about using Rain-X on my glasses, but now it's starting to seem like a good idea. Is there a way to keep this from happening or at least to a minimum? 

From the images they all look the same. Furthermore, what is the difference between mountain bike specific cables and road bike specific cables? 

You can but there are a couple things you will have to do first. Like @FreeMan was saying, to do it properly you would need to thoroughly clean and I would also use a degreaser before you paint it. Something you could try before using the clear coat would and adhesion promoter like this. Even after doing all of that, there is no telling how well it will work and/or how long it will last. Without a proper paint booth or ideal conditions it can be really easy to screw up a paint job. If there is any underlying rust that hasn't presented itself, it will eventually even with a new coat. Your best bet if you really want to do a proper job, is to sand, prime, paint again, and then use a clear coat. If you want preserve the paint then you may be out of luck. If you want to simply restore/reuse the frame then I would just go back and do a proper job. It all depends on if it's worth the time, money, and energy to you. 

I don't have this problem when riding out on the road. My cadence is the same for the most part. I usually keep it on a medium resistance and the bike is level. The trainer itself rides really smooth and feels pretty similar to riding on flat ground. Is there a reason why the trainer would cause pain in my knees? 

Under what circumstances would it be advisable to ride a century without stopping? If a person had: 100% daylight; no mechanical failures; and, no stop signs or lights to deal with, it would seem possible that she/he could ride 100 or more miles on a bicycle without ever putting a single foot back on the ground. Given the above assumptions, I'm wondering what other conditions make it favorable for a rider to forgo all stops. Apart from the above mentioned perils, it would seem to me that nutrition, hydration, waste disposal and arm fatigue would be the greatest challenges. 

I did an unsupported century last year on my 30 pound "shop" mountain bike. The first 55 miles were easy but the last 45 or so were pretty horrible. This year, I want to try it again but with more hills. I really don't want to lug my 30 pound mountain bike up the hills, but I don't have the money for a decent road bike. If I follow a reasonable training plan on my 30 pound mountain bike this year, will I be "safe" moving into high-dollar 15 pound rental road bike 24 hours before an unsupported century? WARNING: This question was edited from its original version. It originally used the term "homemade" century to denote an unsupported century. Also, the question originally asked if it would be okay to switch to a road bike the day of the mentioned century. Now, the question asks if it is safe to switch 24 hours before the mentioned century. 

Is it feasible for an experienced single seat cyclist to serve as captain of a tandem bicycle and effectively "pull" the stoker behind as if the said stoker was riding in a trailer? It's understood the said stoker will be required to maintain some cadence and balance, but it seems possible that a sufficiently skilled single seat cyclist would theoretically be able to compensate for significant stoker errors. Additionally, I know it would help if the captain had tandem experience, but some experienced single seat cyclists may not have time to try out a tandem before pairing with an inexperienced stoker. 

Why is it angled like that? Does it have a purpose? I lowered my handlebars and with that angle it looks hideous. The stem sticks out over the spacers now. When it was at the top with no spacers below it looked fine. 

This is probably a stupid question and the answer is more or less subjective, but when should you join a team or club? I've just started to take road cycling seriously and noticed on my rides there are many teams/clubs out riding where I live. Is there normally a criteria for joining? Right now I go on 30 mile rides and average around 13-14mph. That's somewhat pushing my limits. How far and fast should I be able to go to keep up with and consider joining one of these teams? I will have to wait around 30 years to join the 50 and over club, but truth be told I probably couldn't keep up with them anyway lol. They are no joke where I live. 

If I understand your question correctly, what you could do is add a thin piece of rubber underneath the rail clamp before you tighten it down. That should have the same effect as using a rubberband to help remove a stripped screw. The rubber will fill between the cracks that have been worn down, previously causing your saddle to slide back. It's worth a shot considering it will cost you nothing or next to nothing. 

I'm relatively new to cycling so this question may be obvious to some of you. When I get into certain gears my chain or drive train makes a noise that I can only to compare to the noise a rollercoaster makes when it starts going up the first hill. (That analogy will either make perfect sense to you or you won't get it at all) It happens specifically when I get into higher gears on the rear rear cassette. What could be causing it to make this ungodly noise? 

I noticed that Lance does not have a front derailleur. His left shifter has been replaced with a simple brake lever and it appears the front derailleur cable is missing. Contrast this to his teammate's bike (4 cables, both shifters present). On a flat or medium mountain stage, this setup could make sense as a way to potentially simplify the drivetrain. However, in 2003, Stage 8 finished at the summit of Alpe d'Huez. It's true that Lance raced using a number of banned substances and pro cyclists are capable of high power outputs. However, given that most (if not all) of his competitors on that day looked to have front derailleurs and that his bike was presumably at the UCI weight limit (set at current levels in 2000) without dropping the front derailleur this seems like a brash decision. Was this a "Lance thing" or did other pro cyclists do this in the mountains? Are there examples of other pro cyclists going without a front derailleur, post 2000? 

In common cycling parlance, 53/39 is referred to as "standard" gearing for road cranksets, and most mechanics or experienced cyclists will understand that if you say you have a "standard crankset", you have a 53/39. Why is this the case? Who or what caused cycling to specifically adopt 53/39 as "standard" (rather than 52, 51, 50, etc)? Most bikes nowadays ship with a compact crankset, since manufacturers recognize that the majority of cyclists have difficulties turning over a 53T chainring. However, that only explains why 53/39 is not shipped as standard equipment on most bikes, it doesn't explain how 53/39 came to be referred to as "standard". As to the "ego/testosterone" explanation, that explains why some cyclists upgrade from compact cranksets. However, there are cyclists that are more than capable of turning a 53T chainring and, therefore, their reasoning for using a 53T does not involve ego/testosterone/posturing. Additionally, this explanation doesn't really explain why 53T is the "standard" big ring, rather than 54T or 55T. A comment on a previous question sparked this (apologies to that user as I can't seem to find their comment now). 

Whenever I use my CycleOps magnetic trainer (like the one pictured below) my knees always end up hurting. 

I have a Felt Z80 road bike like the one pictured below. Would it be possible to add disc brakes instead of the caliper brakes it came with? I don't plan on getting a new bike for awhile so I thought this would be a beneficial upgrade because I ride in the rain from time to time. 

I came across this article that somewhat explains why it is angled. Basically what it does is provide a slight angle without having to use a stem that is adjustable. What it fails to mention is that you can't place spacer rings above the stem meaning your handlebars must be at the top of steerer tube. Too add to all of that nonsense you have to use a top cap that has a hole that is off center to accommodate the angle. It seems really stupid to me but if those extra few degrees of angle are what you need to dial in your fit then I suppose having an angled shim would be useful. 

In my experience the best way to fix/prevent that issue is before you install the pedals make sure to apply a water proof grease like this to the threads. 

From what I was told, steel frames show their degradation with rust while aluminium alloy may not show any signs at all even though it is still degrading. How can you tell if an aluminum alloy frame is starting to degrade before catastrophic failure? How long can I expect an aluminum alloy frame to last? 

Without any inside information into the R&D efforts of Shimano, SRAM or Campagnolo, it's pure speculation at best. I assume that they are looking at the idea of 12-speed, but it'll probably be close to 10 years until we see it (9 to 10 speed took ~7 years; 10 to 11 speed took ~9 years), especially with all the focus on electronic gruppos at the moment. Same answer in regards to the freewheel standards...it's impossible to say, since 12 speed hasn't even come out yet. Bottom line: it's hard to know for sure, but it's believable that they (the big three) would be developing 12 speed. 

The other advancements are great - carbon frames, 11-speed, electronic shifting, carbon wheels, etc - but they're not essential for jumping into races. If you're curious whether your setup is "good enough" for racing, take note of how well you keep pace with your peers in one of the faster group/shop rides in your area. 

I understand wearing base layers in the colder months, but I see cycling clothing companies (Castelli, Assos, Rapha, etc) also making undershirts specifically for hot summer riding. Given how lightweight and breathable some of the summer jerseys are (like Castelli's Climber's Jersey), why would riders want to add another layer during the summer? What are the advantages to wearing an undershirt during the summer? 

In a similar situation - bike tire marks, trainer residue and grease spots on the carpet - we found that scrubbing the carpet using a concentrated dish detergent (like Dawn, etc) worked very well. 

Take the plunge and try it! Either you'll find that you don't enjoy it or you'll have discovered a wonderful new aspect to cycling. Regardless, you're only out a race fee. Community The cycling community is just like that of any other sport. You have some people who are pros, those who were, some who wish they were, some who think they are and some who don't care. Within every group, you have the people who are out to crush everyone and those that just want to have fun. It becomes an incredibly complex and impossible to map ecosystem, but in the end it doesn't matter; what matters is that you are getting what you want to be getting out of the sport. Find a group of people who are interested in the same things as you and ride with them. If you enjoy it, great. If not, keep looking. I have one weekly group ride that turns into a hammerfest, while the next day I have one where we usually all hang out at the shop later. It is what you make it. If you're looking for "cycling buddies" who are also interested in racing, one option is to look around at some of the more race-focused bike shops in your area. See if they have group rides and jump into one! Technical competitiveness When I started racing, I was on a bike I bought used for $200. My current bike was purchased used for less than $1000. Both bikes have modern shifters, are 9 or 10sp, weigh around 20lbs and are more than adequate to keep pace with or beat people on bikes costing 10x as much, especially at the low- to mid-levels (Cat 3/4/5 in the US). From my experience (marketing departments to the contrary), the bike typically isn't the thing that holds a cyclist back. That being said, my advice would be to try to ensure your bike has these main advancements:
