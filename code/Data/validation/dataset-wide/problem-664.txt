Once is happenstance, twice is a coincidence... I just patched my inner tube, rode the bike a bit, parked it in the sun, and about an hour later --BOOM! the tube exploded tearing a 4" gash near the valve (not near the patch.) This is the second time the exact thing happened. Both times rear, both times after repairing tube. I don't know how old the tubes were, but the second one seems pretty new and the rubber is still very pliable. I tend to overinflate since the roads near me are full of hazards. This time I did not take too much care in seating the tube, but the first time i was very careful and slightly inflated, massaged the tire to make sure there were no folds or twists, and then deflated and inflated. I use a hand pump, and really don't know the pressure but I assume the tire would take any stress from high pressure, and the tube would just be sandwiched in there so high pressure would be no problem. Today was not hot (about 22C), but the sun was on the bike. OK, here's the twist -- not sure if it matters. The tires are 16x1 3/8 BE, that is an old Japanese standard used on old commercial bikes. (believe it or not, it is my daily ride and I take the beast into the mountains (no gears) 2 or 3 times a week.) The tires have ears that go under the tube and overlap protecting the tube from the spoke ends. They are a pain to change, and although you can not see the tube as you seat the tire, you have to check the tire to make sure the ears are straight and not folded and the tube is not pinched, so this system should not make the tube explode in itself. Question -- anyone ever have tubes explode in the sun? Any idea what could cause this? Anyone know what happens if the tube is folded funny in tire -- can it form a bubble that is under too much stress? Is there something I can do to prevent this happening a third time? (three times, it's enemy action.) Update -- (1) I buy the tubes on the net and don't think the stock is old. These delivery bikes were very common in Japan so they are still selling the tubes but not so much locally. (2) no rim strips - the tire becomes the rim strip i will try to attach photo of a tire below. (3) I don't assume the tire will take any pressure, but I assume the tube, when constrained inside the tire will. (4) $URL$ shows a cutaway of the tire system on at the bottom of the page on the right (with "B/E" above the drawing.) (sorry about the Japanese.) You can see the tire is about as thick under the tube as it is on the tread. That is the "ears" i mention above. This also makes it very hard for tire to come off rim, as the pressure of the tube is forcing the bead into the groove. I think D.R Hicks' comment may be a clue, but I can't see how tire could unseat with this system. I did not see it happen, but afterward the tire was slightly unseated at the spot of the gash, but when the pressure is gone it is hard to tell with this system. Again, the pressure hold everything in place. (5) the gash (both times) was at about the 4:00, with the valve stem at 6:00 position. Update 2 -- here is a photo of a typical B/E tire. (Sorry I can not post photos yet.) $URL$ The white parts go under the tube. They are white (i think) so you can tell that they are not folded during assembly - this is not a white wall tire. To assemble, you have to put one side on, make sure the ear is laying flat and goes all the way under the tube from bead to bead, then insert the tube and do the same for the other side making sure tube is not poking through. when assembled the white is completely under the tube. You also have to notch the ears for the valve stem to poke through before you use. They used to sell a special tool, but I use an exacto. Update 3 -- Sorry if i am being wordy. These tires/rims were very common in Japan until about 10 years ago. Almost all delivery bikes used this system and many of the bikes are still out there. My guess is that they used this type of rim from the 60's until around 2000 on most delivery bikes, and some high end mama-chari's. Update - Final answer -- I think @Daniel and @mattnz are correct and the tire must be coming off the rim. I initially discounted this, since the B/E system makes it seem impossible, but now I am convinced this is the case. The tire is slipping off the rim at the valve stem because the ears have the notch for the stem and this is a weak point. My guess is that the sun is making the rubber soft and more pliable and the top ear is able to slip past the tube and bottom ear to unseat the bead. This seems unlikely, as the tube pressure is holding the three pieces together, but it is the only possibility. I researched in Japanese about B/E blowouts, but could not find anything. This is why I initially thought the tube was pinched or folded somehow and in that case it would be potentially a problem for any tire, but now I think the problem is unique to B/E rims. The solution I will try, is to clean off the rubber and rim really well so that the four layers (rim, ear, ear, tube) all grip when under pressure. This is the opposite of what I planned to do before the discussion, as I thought some talc might help a tube kink straighten out. I may even put a dab of rubber cement between the ears near the valve stem. Many thanks for the Help 

The main difference between road and mountain shoes are the stiffness. On road bikes, the shoes are much stiffer allowing for a more efficient transfer of energy from you -> crank -> tire -> road. When you are in a race and every tenth of a second counts, the more efficient you are the better. On a mountain bike, you give up some efficiency, so you don't sprain your ankle every time you plant your foot. Flexibility is better than stiffness. 

Pinch flats are due to under-inflation of tires. On a road bike you should be inflating your tires to 120-130 lbs. Also, you need to check and re-inflate your tires every time you ride. I just keep my pump right next to my bike, and wind up adding air every 2nd or 3rd day. I see you added tire size - those are older bike tires, they don't inflate as high as road bike tires, I'd try pumping them to 65 lbs, and if you are still getting pinch flats, go up 5 lbs at a time until it stops. You can tell a pinch flat because it will look like a snake bit, 2 small holes close together. If you do not get any pinch flats at 65 lbs, you can try going down 5 lbs at a time until they return, then you know the range your tires need to be at to be properly inflated. The most important thing is to check tire pressure every time you ride, as bike tires can lose up to 5/lbs a week from just sitting. These are high pressure tires, so they lose air much faster than low pressure car tires. Cheers, Mike 

A collections of thoughts about a few of the questions you've raised. The short answer to the title question is 'yes'. Read further for some specifics. Equipment If you have the budget for multiple new bikes, that's great. However, based on your apparent wants, I'd suggest the 'more serious rode bike' be a cyclocross bike. You can put slicks on a 'cross bike and it is effectively a road bike. You simply put on different tires for when you want to race/train in the mud. Winter and Spring Training If it's in your budget, definitely get a trainer. They are far from exciting, but regular sessions on the trainer through the winter will do wonders for your fitness coming into the spring. For the most part you will want to be riding so that you're sort of breathing deeply, but could still carry on a conversation. There really isn't a whole lot of point to doing anything really painful during this period, other than combat boredom of long winters. If you're into snow sports, cross country skiing is a great way to get/stay fit over the winter that doesn't involve being inside all the time. Spring and Summer Ride lots. Have fun. Listen to your body and get professionally fitted on your new 'cross or road bike, it is surprisingly easy to get injured early in a new sport. You will want to start riding faster every now and then. Find a couple of local routes or hills that you occasionally try to set personal records on. You are new at the sport, so in most places your races will be < 40 minutes. This means you don't need to go out and hammer for 4 hours. (And shouldn't unless you really enjoy this) The only real specific training I'd suggest at this point in time (later summer) is occasionally do things like 20 seconds sprinting, 20 seconds soft pedalling, repeat for several minutes at a time. Take a break for a few minutes then do it again a couple of times. Do this once or at most twice in a week. The major reason I suggest this is because 'cross is extremely stochastic. Unlike road racing (running or cycling), triathlons or most other reasonably common endurance sports, a 'cross race is often 10 seconds flat out, 5 seconds braking and coasting around a hairpin, 30 seconds flat out, get off the bike, run, pedal carefully through an off camber corner, flat out for 15 seconds... You get the idea, but your body needs to experience this a few times before you do it in a race. Technical Skills While I don't think you need to spend huge amounts of time on this early in your career, you also don't want to try this stuff out for the first time in a race. Find a nice park nearby. Find some trees that are close together and try riding in an '8' pattern around them as quickly as you can. Do this in dry and wet conditions. Your bike will slip out from under you eventually. Learn what it feels like just before the bike washes out, this is important. Every race will have a part where you need dismount. Ride for 30 seconds hardish, dismount, run with the bike for 30 seconds, then hop back on and ride again. (Youtube for techniques, I'd suggest not trying the flying remount, it's generally not worth it...) Racing You've practiced, you've been riding for a year, great! Get out there and race. Do at least a lap or two of the course before the race. You want to be pretty warmed up before you start and then just cut loose. A couple of other random points. Due to the hard/coast/hard/coast nature of a cyclocross race, you will almost certainly blow up. This can be a new and exciting experience so you should be aware of it. You will want to get off your bike Right Now and maybe lay down for a while. This is normal. Cyclocross is an endurance event, so you will need to occasionally lower your pace and recover. 

if you are positive it's coming form the bottom bracket, and you have already R&R'd them, try using Teflon tape instead (plumber’s tape), wrap it around the cups and reinstall them - this should fix any squeaks in the BB. 

Mark your tire where the tube's valve stem is located, remove the tube, inflate it and put it in a bucket of water. Look for bubbles. This is where your leak is. Now inspect the tire and rim at the correlating point for something that may be causing the leak. Good Luck. 

If your derailleur is adjusted properly, and you are slipping gears, it's usually a worn chain and rear cog. Take the bike into your local bike shop, and they can help you get replacements. 

A schrader valve require air pressure to open, A presta does not. The biggest difference will seen when airing up a tire past 100+lbs, A shcrader will take more pumps to get from 100 to 110, because at that high of a pressure, more air is required to open the valve, whereas on a presta all the air goes into airing up the tire.
