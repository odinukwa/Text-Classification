The Sun will never run out of Hydrogen. This is a common misconception. At this moment the Sun is fusing Hydrogen into Helium. This fused Helium remains at the core until it will reach a critical mass. At this point the core will begin to collapse. This collapse increases the temperature and pressure around the core where Hydrogen is being fused causing the increase the Hydrogen fusion which also causes an increase of the radiation pressure making the outer layers to expand and cool. Once the core reaches a temperature of about 100 million Kelvin Helium fusion starts dramatically (Helium Flash) with high radiation pressure in the core. Here is where the Sun will reach 250 times it's current radius. When the Helium fusion stabilizes the radiation pressure at the cores decreases making the Sun's radius to shrink. The temperature will only drop at the surface because as it's expands it's further from the core. 

To measure the surface temperature of a star it is used is it's black body spectrum. You would have to get the light curve of the light from tat star and then by checking it's peak you could guess its temperature. I really don't know which instruments to use to get the light curve from a distant star but you could use a tool like this one for the final conversion: $URL$ 

The hand method used by Nainoa Thompson to find the altitude of the Polaris. Journal of the Polynesian Society In Hawai'i, the “North Star”, Polaris, is Hokupa'a, meaning “fixed star”. It lies close to the north celestial pole. The altitude of Hokupa'a indicates your northerly latitude. In the film, we see Moana Waialiki using this technique to measure the altitude of a group of stars. Look closely and you can see that she’s measuring the stars in Orion’s Belt. The position of Moana’s hand indicates the star above her index finger has an altitude of 21º. Given that the movie takes place about 2,000 years ago near Samoa, the position of Orion indicates they are travelling exactly due East. 

Moana measures altitude of Orion’s belt stars. Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures Later in the film, we see Moana navigating by following Maui’s fish hook. In the various Polynesian traditions, the hook was used to pull islands from the sea. It is represented by the constellation Scorpius, which rises at dusk in mid-May. This indicates southeasterly travel. 

You must have misheard it, or the documentary you watched wasn't presenting very precise information. It does set but it also stays on the night sky for several days during the polar winter (polar night) when the Moon if full. This is relatively simple to imagine, so I'll describe it; So what's happening is that the Earth's axial tilt during the polar winters leans the whole Northern hemisphere towards the night side, away from the Sun. This tilt is big enough (~ 23.4°) that the night sky objects aligned with the Earth's equatorial plane stay visible relatively low on the horizon. With those regions being either relatively flat and/or with a view towards the sea, there's not many obstructions limiting the viewing angle, so the Moon (and analogous also the Sun during polar summers) stays "locked" low above the horizon. To help a bit with imagining this, here's an animation of the Earth's axial tilt, courtesy of Wikipedia:                                                     If we imagine this animation of the Earth with the Sun in the distant left of the image, so during Northern hemisphere's winter (winter solstice to be precise), and the Moon to the distant right of the image (roughly 25 widths of the image away), so when it's either full or close to this lunar phase, it's not too difficult to appreciate that the northernmost polar regions have a direct line of sight of the Moon during Earth's full rotation on its axis, or a day. If you keep in mind that other celestials, including the Moon, are oblivious to the Earth's axial tilt (well, not exactly, but let's not nitpick about tidal effects that might take millions of years to make a difference), as the Moon moves farther in its orbit, in our case towards the viewer, this observation angle decreases further still and those northernmost latitudes hide to us for some part of the day. At lunar last quarter, it would be directly towards us relative to the image, so this direct line of sight relationship between the Earth and the Moon becomes reciprocal to how we're seeing places on the Earth on the animation. Why when the Moon is full? Simply because that's when the Moon is also behind the Earth (but not in its shadow), so the relative angle between the observation point and the Moon would stay high enough to observe it. As it moves in lunar phase and in orbit around the Earth farther, this angle becomes lower and the Moon indeed does set also in the arctic region. For what is worth, this goes exactly the same for South pole, only with a half a year difference. One other effect that plays a role here is the Earth's atmospheric refraction which also adds to the duration during which the Moon appears not to set. Meaning, that even when the Moon wouldn't be in direct line of sight, but only marginally so, it would still appear low on the skies due to optical effect (displacement) of the atmosphere. This effect would somewhat offset observing the Moon from lowlands with possibly shallower observation angle when compared to higher altitude observation points with less direct line of sight obstructions, due to denser atmosphere and thus higher refraction index. 

Referring to your #gravity tag this would only create a peak in the planets tidal forces. But this would be a visible effect in case the planets would be big and close enough... Last night happened that with Sun-Earth-Moon although they were not aligned as you say. To sum up: a proper alignment would increase the effect of tidal forces. 

The Tidal acceleration between 2 bodies is calculated with this formula: $$ a_T = \frac{2GM_MR_1}{Dm^3} $$ Where $M_M$ is Mar's mass, $R_1$ Earth Radius and $D_m$ the distance to the Moon. If you equal this to Moon's Tidal acceleration you will get $D_M$ as distance to Mars to get the same Tidal acceleration having $\frac{M_M}{M_m}=8.73328184501$: $$ D_M = \sqrt[3]{8.73}D_m\simeq2.06Dm $$ 

We could compare a big star to a small one like a Formula 1 car to a simple car: the F1 is faster, but it runs out of fuel earlier. 

As you say stars composition depend on the composition of the molecular cloud where they were created. You have a molecular cloud where many stars are being created at the same time, all with the same composition and age, but some are bigger than others. As time goes the bigger stars will die earlier, adding new heavier materials to the cloud which will lead to a new generation of stars with a bigger metalicity. So the star's composition not only depends on where it was created but also on how old it is. The best way this can be checked is by studying the stars within a star cluster.

By definition, the capitalized word Universe denotes everything there is, so even if we one day discovered we're just a part of a Multiverse, all the parallel universes of it would still be parts of the Universe as a whole, where Multiverse would just describe its nature. Or, if some yet undiscovered regions of it would defy our current understanding of its physical laws and constants as we know them, all of it would still be a part of the whole Universe. So it really doesn't matter, if beyond the known universe, there are regions of honey, milk and chocolate biscuits and all of it is carried by a giant tortoise. All of it would be the Universe, the physical universe as we can observe, the honey, milk, chocolate biscuits and the tortoise. The lot. All of it. The whole shebang. Notice that I use capitalisation here, i.e. you can have more than one universe, but they're all a part of the Universe. Without capitalisation, it's just any domain, a particular sphere in physical or metaphysical sense, and only a part of the whole Universe. Sadly, this capitalisation is often neglected or used inconsistently, as is often the case with earth vs the Earth (the top soil vs the planet), sun vs the Sun (any star with planets vs our Sol), moon vs the Moon (any natural satellite vs our Luna), even galaxy vs the Galaxy (any galaxy vs our Milky Way). For example, observable universe is a sphere, a region of space, within the Universe. The beauty of this naming convention is, that we already know the name for (but not necessarily of) everything there is, even if we don't know or can agree on what all that encompasses, or what laws govern some regions of space, time, or some other, yet unknown existence of it. It is universally true regardless of anyone's beliefs, even if they choose to call all of it by other names or attribute this existence to a sentient being, super being, or God. We're all a part of everything there is - the Universe. 

It would be detectable due to its gravity effect on other planets, comets and the Sun. Check these sites for further info: $URL$ $URL$ 

I've always wondered about this same question. In my opinion it could be possible, but I guess we would need a really powerful telescope to see proper images of the Earth through a distant mirror. I can also imagine instead of sending a distant mirror sending a telescope facing the earth. 

You can check this thanks to this amazing plot: $URL$ But this is not all you need to hold an stable atmosphere like the Earth does. The object will also need some protection against the solar wind. In the Earth we have a magnetic field that prevents the solar wind to reach our atmosphere, but in the case of Mars it has a weak and poor magnetic field to defend itself against the solar wind that rips it's atmosphere. 

Exactly. Seasons and its difference between northern and southern hemisphere are caused due to the tilt of the Earth's axis. But this is not the only thing involved. An other important fact is the orbit's eccentricity: a very eccentric orbit would cause a whole planet "summer" when around the perihelion and a whole planet "winter" near the aphelion. There would be also extreme permanent hot zones near the equator and extreme permanent cold zones at poles. 

Looking at Scorpius - Maui’s Hook - in the same orientation as shown in the film. Stellarium However, the positions of the stars are not fixed in time. Over the 3,500 years that Polynesians have been exploring the Pacific, the stars have gradually shifted due to precession of the equinoxes. From the latitude of Samoa, the Southern Cross has lowered from 60º altitude in 1500 BCE to 41º today. Those navigating by the stars must gradually adjust their measurements as the positions of stars slowly shift over time." 

If the Earth is indeed a sphere then the altitude of the celestial poles above the horizon should be the same as your latitude on the Earth. That is, as you travel along a line of latitude, the altitude of the pole should change accordingly. 

The phased array feeds (PAFs) on ASKAP are indeed located at the focal plane. The ASKAP PAFs have 188 receivers, and from this digital beam-forming will create 36 independent beams on the sky. Some more information can be found from the CSIRO. Imaging is then done by scanning the dish (or letting the sky roll overhead). The scanning can then be done much faster than with a single receiver. Its important not to confuse these independent beams with purpose of the array itself. The main reason for using an array is interferometry. We use an array for this purpose to have multiple baselines (the distance between the antennas). Having multiple baselines allows the telescope to 'see' structure various angular resolutions. It's true that you can use the array in a 'fly's eye' mode, and then every dish is providing 36 independent beams. In this mode even larger areas of the sky can be scanned quickly. This is useful for searching for transient events such as fast radio bursts. So, the phasing within the PAF needs to be correlated and the beams formed digitally, and then the signals from each dish need to correlated. A huge task indeed! The computing breakdown for ASKAP is given here. A new supercomputer (Pawsey) has been built in WA for the purpose of processing ASKAP data. 

Apparent magnitude is a rather complex way to determine the brightness of a star. Quoting the introduction text from the linked to Wikipedia page: 

The term you're searching for is probably accretion (I guess it might sound similar to a kerzan if the speaker had a cold or the listener couldn't hear it well enough for other reasons). This term is not limited to close binary stars (accreting binaries) cannibalizing each other because they orbit each other at such proximity that the L1 Lagrange point between them extends into their own Roche lobe, they form accretion disks connected through an accretion stream, and they feed off each other (thus why this is often referred to as cannibalism):                   Artist's conception shows an accreting binary at the center of the globular cluster NGC 6624 (Source: U. of Tennessee AstroWiki) Some examples of accreting binaries are symbiotic novae, X-ray binaries, microquasars, X-ray pulsars, and so on. See links for more examples and explanations. Other examples of accretion include stellar accretion of planetary materials of a planet in a low altitude orbit around its parent star, formation of planets via accretion of materials of the protoplanetary disk, active galactic nucleus (AGN) like quasars (could also sound similar), novae, and e.g. the Earth still accretes on average ~ 110 metric tons of new materials per day, too. 

As you said in your question we only know about Black Holes creating in Super Novae, which lead to relatively big BH. The reason they can't be smaller in these cases it that they are created when the core of the star reaches a critical mass that overflows both the electron and the neutron degeneracy. Lower masses can be hold by those degenerate mass states and won't collapse any further. Theoretically BH with masses less than the solar one could exists if there was some method capable to compress it's mass reaching radii smaller than their Schwarzschild radius. 

This picture was taken by the WISE (Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer) space telescope. It is in deed an infrared picture of the entire universe but what you see in this line is our home galaxy, the Milky Way. This telescope has taken infrared pictures of the entire Universe (as we see from the Earth) and joined them in this full-sky view. More info: $URL$ 

I recommend you to take a look at Wikipedia about the ISS's orbit: Wikiepdia - ISS: Orbit There is also a very interesting video that I think will answer to your question: ISS Orbit animation 

There are many such online services, most of them free and a Google search away, so I won't make this a list answer, and since you didn't specify what data in particular you're hoping to find, here's one of my favorite satellite trackers with fairly complete position data, ground track display, map options and so on: NASA iSAT (Interactive Satellite Viewer). You might want to allow it to use your location for more convenient display, but it isn't necessary to enable that. That's for a desktop computer, but if you're hoping to spot satellites (a.k.a. tracking) on the go, then I'd personally suggest installing Sky Map + on your smartphone / tablet (it is free, but there are of course others), because it includes a lot more useful information and has both compass / gyroscope / GPS positioning for easier identification of spotted satellites (it pans automatically) as well as manual panning mode. You can tap on screen to display the toolbar and select objects that you want displayed, or switch to ruby & black monochromatic night mode, if default display is too bright. Satellite information can be updated in settings via an additional download, and all of it is free. For downloadable data alone (to perhaps include in your own software or import into your database), one of such sites is CelesTrak that includes TLE (Two-Line Element) sets and a Space Track TLE Retriever 3 tool to download Space Track data sets.
