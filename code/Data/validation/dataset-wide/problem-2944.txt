Materialism is a fighting term from 19th century. Moreover, the quote builds up a straw man for subsequent materialism bashing. Nobody advocates to reduce every explanation to the matter concept used in the physics of the 19th century. The modern version of the term materialism is physicalism. It includes all concepts of contemporary physics, e.g., electromagnetism and the more general concepts of fields. Nevertheless, physicalism adopts the maxim: Measure what is measurable, make measurable what not yet can be measured. But one characteristics of mental processes is information processing. Hence I would concede to the critique that physicalism has to be extended by the concept of information. The extended version, named science, also deals with mental processes. That’s the aim of neuroscience. There is no obstruction in principle to consider perception a kind of information processing. Taking the input from the sensors of the sense organs, and processing - depending on the internal memory - an integrated result at the level of the cortex. Notably, science is not a self-refuting position. 

The terms of the model must be clear and understandable. The premisses of the model should be made explicit. The statements of the model must be consistent, i.e. they must not introduce a contradiction. The theory must state the problems it attempts to solve, and it must present a solution. 

The domain of stochastics relies on generalization the two discrete truth-values 0 and 1 to the continuous interval [0,1] of probabilities, i.e. all real numbers between 0 and 1 are possibile probabilities. Choosing "0" and "1" as two distinguished truth values is a suitable convention - remember the dual system in computing. Probabilities have to satisfy certain axioms, e.g. for disjoint sets A and B of events p(A union B)= p(A) + p(B) Therefore one cannot choose quite arbitrary numbers for probabilities and truth values. 

By choosing the orientation the humans think the cube may have, we can say that we generated a random sequence of 0s and 1s. But is it truly so ? If we do this test to thousands or more, we may find that a selection is way more preferred compared to the other. That means some other pre-determined factor (like spatial orientation capabilities, geometry knowledge, the distance between the eyes and object) influences the choice. So in order to actually have the random result we must consider all these factors when making the test. So basically, if we are able to account for everything involved, we may find a trick to generate something truly random. Otherwise...slim chances. 

University research is not a guarantee for accuracy of theory. Any theory can get to be widely accepted and then something else comes in that invalidates the initial theory. It's how science evolves. Given this and how today's science and specially physics tends to work, I'd rather trust an independent research of a small group of scientists than that of an university's research. The logic is most of the time university projects are bound to comply by the very restrictive already established theories (there are exceptions, but they do not form a majority) while independent research can practically dig in any direction unrestricted. So far this approach worked very well for my research teams. 

For assessing religion from the view of psychology and sociology of religion see e.g., Kay, Aaron et al.: Religious Belief as Compensatory Control. Personality and Social Psychology Review. 14(1) 37-48, 2010. The references of that paper point to several recent papers about the whole subject. 

Added. 1) mental construction: Mathematical objects are ideas, they do not exist as physical objects. Sophisticated concepts like Hilbert space or Riemann manifold have been created by man and fixed by definitions. Hence they are mental constructions. This opinion is not shared by all philosophers of mathematics. Instead, some keep alive the discussion whether mathematical objects have been invented or have been detected. 2) mental construction: Mathematicians from the school of intuitionism reject the existence of mathematical objects like the set of all natural numbers. They accept "potential" infinity like constructing one number after the other - without an end. But they reject "actual" infinity, which equals the cardinalty of the set of natural numbers taken as a whole. Instead, they request that any object must be constructible. Therefore they do not accept the method of indirect proof. It builds on the law of the excluded middle. 

Can similarities be found in western philosophy with the eastern concept of self (no-self) in Buddhism? Yes. A striking parallelism to Buddha's view of no-soul is expanded by the Scottish philosopher David Hume. "A Treatise on Human Nature" contains a whole section "Of Personal Identity" (Book 1, Part IV, Section VI). Hume writes: But setting aside some metaphysiciens of this kind, I may venture to affirm of the rest of mankind, that they are nothing but a bundle or collection of different perceptions, which succeed each other with an inconceivable rapidity, and are in a perpetual flux and movement. Apparently these perceptions cohere. According to Hume, the principles of coherence are: 

The above is a 4D object represented on 2D. Quite the loss of visual information here. A 3D holographic projection could offer way more clues as to how a hypercube may look like. In that case. you would a 4D object represented on 3D. Much more visual info to get from that. But what humans lack in this case is the initial image of how the 4D hypercube looks in 4D. Due to that, there is no end point for the extrapolation to work, so in most cases humans will not be able to extrapolate at all a 4D object. 

It cannot be objective. It's not defined anywhere, it has no exact specs therefore you cannot make an universal rule for it. It will always be subjective, no matter what some completed in polls or not. Even in extreme situations (like mutilation) some may find that more attractive than the normal so beauty will always be subjective. The fact that so more (even a majority) agree on something does not make it objective. 

One does not have to agree to a conclusion if he agrees to all the facts leading to it. Example: you can have 5 symptoms and a nurse can maybe formulate a diagnostic bases on that. But the doctor with many years of experience may independently check that all 5 symptoms exists and manifest as described by the nurse but he may set a totally different diagnostic. Hegel himself admitted that his dialectical method was part of a philosophical tradition dating back to Plato but he criticized Plato’s version of dialectics. Hegel argued that Plato’s dialectics deals only with limited philosophical claims and is unable to get beyond skepticism or nothingness. According to the logic of a classic reduction to absurd argument, if the premises of an argument lead to a contradiction, we must conclude that the premises are false. That leaves us with practically nothing. In turn, Karl Marx presented his own dialectic method, which he claims to be a direct opposite of Hegel's method. Direct quote from Marx in the paper "Afterword": 

In my opinion, the premiss of your question is correct. And eminent physicists like Weinberg or Feynman support the conclusion. Nevertheless I am sure, that fellows from the philosophical fraction will mention other physicists as counter examples, physicists who admit a certain value of philosophy for physics - possibly Rovelli. Apparently the subject is discussed in a controversial manner. 

In the first case, absolute moral values are always the same, they are constant and do not change in time. In the second case, absolute moral values can vary between different societies and can also be replaced by other moral values. In the field of ethics it is discussed whether absolute moral values in the first sense actually exist. Concerning the second meaning, it is also discussed whether at least one absolute moral value has been established in a given society and holds without conflicting with other moral values. Possibly one can find examples in the field of religious prescriptions, e.g., the first of the Jewish Ten Commands claims unrestricted validity. 

The resulting directed graph has several cycle-free directed paths containing the vertices A and D and starting with a vertex different from A and D. This property shows that A and D are probable because of other propositions, hence the probability of their respective truth is not circular. 

The reference to Anaximander is the famous fragment A9 = B1: it is neither water nor any other of the so-called elements, but some different, boundless nature, from which all the heavens arise and the kosmoi within them; out of those things whence is the generation for existing things, into these again does their destruction take place, according to what must needs be; for they make amends and give reparation to one another for their offense, according to the ordinance of time kosmoi = plural of kosmos As you see Anaximander makes his claim in a juridical context. I would like to refer to two interpretations: 1) Internet encyclopedia of philosophy $URL$ 2) Charles Kahn: Anaximander and the origins of Greek cosmology. 1960. Free download from $URL$ (Note. It takes some time) You can start with page 166ff. The paraphrase from Aristoteles probably refers to Aristotle: Physics. Book III, Chap. 5, 204b 25ff: for there are some people who make this the infinite, and not air or water, in order that the other elements may not be annihilated by the element which is infinite. They have contrariety with each other-air is cold, water moist, fire hot; if one were infinite, the others by now would have ceased to be. As it is, they say, the infinite is different from them and is their source. It is impossible, however, that there should be such a body; not because it is infinite on that point a general proof can be given which applies equally to all, air, water, or anything else-but simply because there is, as a matter of fact, no such sensible body, alongside the so-called elements. Everything can be resolved into the elements of which it is composed. Hence the body in question would have been present in our world here, alongside air and fire and earth and water: but nothing of the kind is observed. 

I think this is not about randomness vs objectiveness but rather randomness vs nothing being actually random. Objectivity has it's own opposite: relativity. Because of relativity we have big problems determining what's what, therefore objectivity is recommended specially when dealing with advanced physics, universal laws and such things. 1+1 will always equal 2 only if the correct rules are applied, just as the author said. Otherwise, 1+1 = 2 is not true. As a rule-based example: 1+1 = 10 if the base rule is that we deal with a binary system. To discover if there is any true randomness somewhere in the Universe may not be that easy. For example anything natural is related to Golden Ratio and/or Fibonacci, so there's nothing random in living organisms or plants (not even at DNA level). Going from DNA level and atoms to a very large scale like galaxies, we will notice that even the stars have a non-random arrangement in galaxies. So from an Universal point of view, the vote goes against randomness (note: not to be confused with chaos). That being said, what's left to do is try to generate our own synthetic randomness, just to prove that it can be done. But in this situation, we may find that this isn't easy either. In the case of computers, it's well known that numbers generated using them aren't genuinely random. Any piece of software needs some kind of unpredictable physical input to be able to generate from there. But what about humans ? Well, most of the choices they make are based on something quite pre-determined so we don't get much randomness from there. but as we trick the computer giving it physical input, we could find a way to bypass the human pre-determined concepts so we get something random out of it. Let's design a situation. We have the drawing of a cube. Any sane mature human should understand that those lines drawn in 2D are the representation of a 3D cube. But the orientation of the cube cannot be determined from the 2D drawing, so each human would have to pick a way he thinks the cube orientation is.
