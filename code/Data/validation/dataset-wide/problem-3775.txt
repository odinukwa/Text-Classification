There are certainly many algorithms to desingularize toric varieties (e.g $URL$ I would imagine in analogy with desingularizing surfaces these all involve blowing up successively in some way, which translates to iteratively subdividing cones in the fan that defines the toric variety. Can anyone provide references to find which algorithms might be most helpful if I wanted to compute some properties of the desingularization, and ideally would like to create as few new cones as possible? 

I will start out by saying I am not well-informed about moduli theory in the slightest. However, it is known that some moduli spaces (of algebro-geometric objects) have severe pathologies (Ex: Murphy's Law with regards to Hilbert schemes), while others are very nice, such as $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{1,1}$ which can be identified with the famous modular surface, and on such things differential geometry can be done. This leads me to ask (whether anyone has already asked): 1) When does a moduli space (parametrizing algebro-geometric objects) admit natural Riemannian structure(s) besides possibly on some singular locus? 2) In this case, do geodesics correspond to useful information (nice degenerations between objects perhaps)? 

To each unipotent element $u\in G$ one assigns its weighted Dynkin diagram which is basically a map $\Delta\colon\, \Pi\rightarrow \{0,1,2\}$ where $\Pi$ is a basis of simple roots of the root system of $G$. From $\Delta$ one can read off the characters on ${\mathfrak g}={\rm Lie}(G)$ of a maximal torus $T_0$ of an ${\rm SL}_2$ subgroup containing $u$ (all such subgroups are $G$-conjugate in characteristic $0$ by a classical result of Kostant, as David Stewart pointed out in his comment). If $\Delta(\alpha)=1$ for some $\alpha\in \Pi$ then $\mathfrak g$ has a faithful composition factor for the adjoint action of ${\rm SL}_2$. If $\Delta(\Pi)\subseteq \{0,2\}$ then all weights of $T_0$ on $\mathfrak g$ are even which implies that $-1\in{\rm SL}_2$ acts trivially on $\mathfrak g$. So the case of ${\rm PSL}_2$ occurs if and only if $\Delta(\Pi)\subseteq \{0,2\}$. In this case $u$ is sometimes referred to as even. All one has to do now (for $G$ exceptional) is to open Carter's book on groups of Lie type and examine the list of Dynkin labels on pp. 401--406. For $G$ classical it is explained in Carter's book how to construct $\Delta$ from the partition associated with $u$. So it fairly straightforward to figure out which unipotent elements are even for $G$ classical. Although any even unipotent element of $G$ has to be Richardson, there are plenty of them around. For example, all distinguished unipotent elements of $G$ are even. 

X and Y are proper and irreducible. As a double cover does not crush X to a point, it must be surjective. The fibres are then finite sets which implies that it is a finite morphism. Finite morphisms are affine. Affine morphisms do not have higher direct image (this is just the relative version of the theorem which says that affine schemes do not have higher cohomology with coefficients in quasi-coherent sheaves). 

If I understand the setup of the question correctly, the answer is yes. Using non separated schemes makes no difference. This is explained here. In brief, whether you do the Grothendieck ring of "integral, finite type, separated" or "finite type" or even "finite type algebraic spaces" it's the same. When you pass to stacks it's a whole other mess of course. 

The question might be a bit vague. Certainly there are excellent references online on stability conditions. The first which comes to mind is the most elementary and is by Arend Bayer. If you are already familiar with all of that, these notes by Daniel Huybrechts go deeper into the subject. These are notes from a lecture series delivered in Cambridge, which was recorded on video. Also, I find the original paper by Bridgeland quite readable. 

There is a related old paper by Tits on normalisers of tori, but my copy is long gone and I'm not sure whether the splitting issues had been addressed there. In the case of $E_7$, the sequence does not split over $W$ if the argument below is correct. Indeed suppose that it does. Then $W$ is a subgroup of $G={\rm Aut}(g)$ and for every $\alpha\in \Delta$ we have an involution $\theta_\alpha\in G$ corresponding to the reflection $s_\alpha\in W$. We look at the fixed point algebra $g^{\theta_\alpha}$. If $s_\alpha(\beta)=\beta$ for $\beta\in\Delta$ then ($\theta_\alpha$ being an involution) for any $e_\beta\in g_\beta$ we have that $\theta_\alpha(e_\beta)=c_\alpha(\beta)e_\beta$, where $c_\alpha(\beta)=\pm 1$. Now the centraliser $C_W(s_\alpha)$ contains a reflection subgroup of type $A_1 + D_6$ which acts ttransitively on the set $\Delta_\alpha$ of all roots orthogonal to $\alpha$. From this it is immediate that $c_\alpha(\beta)=c_\alpha(\gamma)$ for all $\beta,\gamma\in\Delta_\alpha$. As we can find $\beta,\gamma\in\Delta_\alpha$ with $\beta+\gamma\in\Delta_\alpha$ and $c_\alpha(\beta+\gamma)=1$, we deduce that $c_\alpha(\beta)=1$ for all $\beta\in\Delta_\alpha$. Now we can compute $\dim\ g^{\theta_\alpha}$. Each pair of distinct roots $(\beta, s_\alpha(\beta))$ contributes $1$ to $\dim\ g^{\theta_\alpha}$. As $|\Delta_\alpha|=60$ and $|\Delta|=126$, the number of such pairs is $33$ and the above discussion shows that $\dim\ g^{\theta_\alpha}=6+60+33=99$. But it is well known (and goes back to E. Cartan's work on simple Lie algebras over $\mathbb{R}$) that there are three conjugacy classes of involutions in $G$ whose fixed point algebras have dimensions $63$, $69$ and $79$. So the extension does not split over $W$. As for the second part of the question, it seems likely to me that the involution of the extended Dynkin diagram of $\Delta$ can be lifted to an involution of $G$. It has the form $w_0w_1$ where $w_0$ is the longest element of $W$ and $w_1$ is that of the Weyl group of the $E_6$-subdiagram. Let $l$ be the corresponding Levi subalgebra of $g$. One just needs to find an involution in $N_G(l)$ which acts as the nontrivial graph automorphism on $[l,l]$ and as $-1$ on the centre of $l$. 

I'm looking for a reference for the following fact (which I believe to be true and should be easy for people who understand how spectral sequences arise from filtrations). 

presumably the reason there is an equality in 3.25 instead of an isomorphism is that you don't want $V_K$ to be abstractly isomorphic to $W$, but you want them to be equivalent subschemes of $X_K$ (ie isomorphic in the category of pairs (scheme, embedding)). At least that's how I would interpret it, but I might be wrong. Also, take $X = P^N$. Saying that $W \subset X_K$ is defined over $k$ means precisely that you can find equations cutting out $X_K$ with coefficients in at most $k$. 

This is somewhat sad, but I think (part of) what we've learned from the whole triangulated-vs-dg story is the following pseudo-statement: the bare category of functors Fun(D(X),D(Y)) is the wrong thing to take -- it should be replaced the category D(X x Y). There is a nice example, due to the usual Bondal-Orlov-Bridgeland people (Example 6.5 in Caldararu's notes), which illustrates this perfectly. Thus, if you find something weird happening in Fun(D(X),D(Y)) you shouldn't be discouraged -- it's not your fault. Of course, there are big names in the field (Canonaco and Stellari to name two) who might disagree with my initial pseudo-statement. It really depends on what you care about. 

I think that the explanation "Because the Cartan classification of isomorphism classes of semisimples is discrete (no continuous families), connected components of the space of semisimples are always contained within isomorphism classes" is a bit simplistic. The real reason, as many people have already mentioned, is Weyl's theorem on complete reducibility, which of course fails in charatcteristic $p$. And it shouldn't come as a surpise that over an algebraically closed field $K$ of characteristic $p>3$ one encounters situations where there are finitely many isoclasses of simple Lie algebras of dimension $N$ and, at the same time, there exist algebraic families of simple $N$-dimensional Lie algebras {$\mathfrak{g}_t|\ t\in K$} over $K$ such that $\mathfrak{g}_t\cong L$ for all $t\ne 0$ and $\mathfrak{g}_0\not\cong L$ for some simple Lie algebra $L$. Indeed, let $N=p^2-2$. Then it follows from the the classification theory that there are finitely many isoclasses of simple $N$-dimensional Lie algebras over $K$. Now consider the associative $K$-algebra $A$ generated by two elements $x,y$ such that $x^p=y^p=0$ and $[x,y]=1$. This is a fake modular version of the first Weyl algebra, and it is easy to see that it is simple and has dimension $p^2$. It has a finite increasing algebra filtration (with $x,y$ living in degree $1$) such that the corresponding graded algebra $P:={\rm gr}(A)$ is the truncated polinomial ring in $x,y$ with induced Poisson bracket satisfying {$x,y$} $=1.$ Then the Lie algebra $[A,A]/K1$ is isomorphic to $\mathfrak{psl}_p(K)$ whilst the Lie algebra {$P,P$}$/K1$ is nothing but the simple Cartan type Lie algebra $H(2;\underline{1})^{(2)}$. Both Lie algebras are simple of dimension $N$ and the latter is a contraction of the former. Moreover, they are not isomorphic when $p>3$. 

Is there a structure theorem for such varieties? If X is a smooth and proper/projective variety whose canonical bundle $\omega_X$ has finite order in the Picard group, do we know anything about X? EDIT: As was pointed out in the comments, if $\omega_X^n = O_X$ then one can find a cycling covering of order n, $Y \to X$, with $\omega_Y = O_Y$. So the problem reduces to understanding varieties with trivial canonical bundle. I'll leave the question as is for a few days more, in case someone else wants to contribute. If nothing happens I will delete it. 

I cannot seem to find stated the following fact, which is surely well known to experts. Let (S,L) be a polarized K3 surface. Then $M = L^{\otimes 3}$ is very ample and we can consider the embedding in the corresponding projective space $S \to P^N$. Question: is the image of $S$ in $P^N$ a complete intersection? I suspect the answer is no but I haven't seen it stated explicitly. (by the way, I am certainly allowing $S = H_1 \cap ... \cap H_k \cap D_1 \cap D_2$, where the $H_i$ are hyperplanes and $D_1, D_2$ or more interesting divisors. (information about other embeddings of S which are complete intersections, or statements about when one can know if S is a complete interesction would be highly appreciated as well) 

Let $\mathbb{H^2}$ be the hyperbolic upper half place, and let $\Gamma$ be a lattice in $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ acting on $\mathbb{H^2}$. A proof of the equidistribution of spheres on $\mathbb{H^2/\Gamma}$ as their radii grow can be found in "Ergodic Theory and Topological Dynamics of Group Actions on Homogeneous Spaces" by Bekka and Meyer. I have been told that this is also true of spheres in $\mathbb{R^2/Z^2}$ but I can't see how to prove this nor find a reference that does. Can anyone see why it is true or know of a reference? 

It is easy to see in coordinates. $\tilde{Y}$ in this scenario can be written as the vanishing of all $2\times 2$ minors of $ \begin{bmatrix} x & y & z & q \\ a_0 & a_1 & a_2 & a_3\end{bmatrix} $ in $\mathbb{A}^4\times\mathbb{P}^3$. Then for example in the coordinate neighborhood $a_0=1$ we have that the support of the total transform of $X$ can be written as $x\cdot ( a_3-a_2 a_3)$, giving us the normal crossing (if we are not just considering the support then clearly the exceptional is non-reduced which prevents normal crossing). 

A more precise description of positive roots $\gamma$ such that $\mu=\lambda-\gamma$ can be found in the paper $URL$ See, in particular, Proposition 1 and Lemma 3. 

Block's theorem does not require the base field $k$ to be algebraically closed but one has to be careful when $k$ is imperfect. Then $k$ will admit field extensions of the form $K=k(a)$ with $a\not\in k$ and $a^p\in k$. Note that $K$ will become a truncated polynomial ring in one variable over a field extension $L=k(b)$ with $b^p=a^p$. If $p>2$ then the $k$-Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{sl}_2\otimes_k K$ is simple of dimension $3p$ (but not absolutely simple) and ${\rm Der}_k(K)$ is a nontrivial $k$-form of the Witt algebra $W(1;\underline{1})$ (such twisted forms can only exist over imperfect fields). By Block's theorem, the derivation algebra of $\mathfrak{g}$ is the semidirect product ${\rm Der}_k(K)\ltimes {\rm ad}\,\mathfrak{g}$ of dimension $4p$ over $k$ but it is not isomorphic to ${\rm Id}\otimes_k W(1;\underline{1})\ltimes ({\rm ad}\,\mathfrak{sl}_2)\otimes_k k[X]/(X^p)$ over $k$. However, such an isomorphism will exist over $L$.
