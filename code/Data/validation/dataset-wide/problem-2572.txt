I think, in summary, that is saying that it is wrong view to identify the five aggregates with the atta -- the "self" (or, soul). So maybe it is no surprise, and not wrong, that sakkāyadiṭṭhi is called "self-view" or "identity-view". Here's a translation: 

Piya Tan at $URL$ has translations and commentary of many of the suttas. Using the "sitemap" on the right or bottom of the page, you can find specific suttas (sorted by number), or, his "sutta discovery (SD) series" which is sorted thematically. Some people disagree with [some of] his commentary (see e.g. this topic). 

As for "how do they deal with those feelings of injustice", I think that would take a long answer -- but, in summary, I think that they practice Buddhism: 

I'm sorry for your loss. I experience this situation only indirectly -- my own mother has been a forgiving sort, avoiding feuding -- but I've seen how much it can distress another child, to fall out with their mother like that. My first reaction, to "walk through the fire without burning oneself" is that, that isn't possible. Also, "I would like to enjoy the remaining years" -- may be a bird that's already flown. There is a related verse though, in the Dhammapada: 

Is identity-view the same then as being aware that skandhas exist? The same as being attracted to (clinging to) sense-objects? Isn't the answer to that, "No that's not true, because 'sensual desire' is the fourth fetter"? Also, questions about the self come with a warning: "This is called a thicket of views, a wilderness of views, etc." -- so I have not been trying to analyze that (views-about-self) ... but maybe I am supposed to know what identity-view is? 

So, there's some answer to your question in the doctrine of the Middle Way. Several suttas (including AN 4.37, AN 4.159, and MN 2) advise eating, not with the intention of creating a feeling of fullness, but only with the intention of removing the feeling of hunger: 

That phrase is found in, for example, the Kalama Sutta: To the Kalamas. The introduction, to that sutta, talks about having wise friends: 

There may be somewhere where it's stated as a positive, i.e. "eating well was necessary to pursue the jhānas and the Middle Way" -- I think I've read something like that, but I don't remember whether that's a direct quote or an indirect paraphrase. The only versions I've found at the moment are expressed as a double-negative, not as a positive, i.e. that "utmost austerity is not the way"; for example from this translation of the (non-canonical) Introduction to the Jâtaka, 

If someone has terminal illness they might make peace with those around them, even if they hadn't previously. Illness might furthermore be an opportunity for full-time practice. To pick another example more or less at random, at time 13:55 of this video Yuttadhammo Bikkhu says that dying of cancer would be an opportunity (a chance) for us to understand the nature of reality. From a Buddhist prospective, are there specific ways (like rituals, prayers) for curing (or helping with) a terminal illness? There are many other references at A Buddhist Guide to Death, Dying and Suffering (the author is or was a chaplain at a medical centre). And What nurses need to know about Buddhist perspectives of end-of-life care and dying (registration required) might be helpful. Also page 82 of this commentary on the Vinaya describes the words a bikkhu might say during the dying process to inspire a patient. 

Pages 44 through 98 describe just four parajika rules, where if a bhikkhu breaks (or has broken) one of these rules then they are automatically no longer a bhikkhu and cannot ordain again in this life: 

I think it's for these kinds of reasons (this kind of evidence) that people believe in rebirth and past life memories. Then when you're considering the subject (of memory) you might wonder what the mechanism for that is ("I wonder how it works, where is memory recorded?"): 

You asked, "If those nihilist wanderers did not believe in 'self' ( and thus used 'conventional language'), why were they not considered to be enlightened?" It seems to me that no matter how they talk about "self", and no matter what kind of "self" or body is annihilated at death, the Buddha's definition of "right view" is something else: e.g. it includes knowledge of cessation of sensation (from the jhanas, I suppose) and liberation from attachment to sensation. 

This too matches (is an even better match for) the "volitional formation" translation. The footnote to that Wikipedia paragraph begins with, "The Theravada Abhidhamma divides saṅkhāra into fifty mental factors". 

I think (I'm not sure) I agree with Andrei's answer. For example, Meetings with a Remarkable Monk doesn't say "dhutaṅga" but it does say "ascetic" several times. His dwelling place (a hut) is dangerous (with poisonous snakes and so on around). 

I think this implies that these four asavas correspond to, are not different than, four of the ten fetters. The Sabbasava Sutta (MN 2) implies that beyond these four there are other asavas, for example ill-will (which too corresponds to another of the ten fetters) 

A few little bits of "self-defence", which I learned not from Buddhism but from (Taoist) Tai Chi (as a "martial art"), included: 

Beware of the way in which you talk about this subject with others. It is wrong to encourage/counsel suicide. 

In summary I suppose I'm saying that where you find the dharma you may also find the sangha ... and that the sangha might help, or at least be less hurtful than some other communities or societies. And, yes. Some people (perhaps including monks) see society itself (or people's reactions to society) as a bit crazy. So far as I know, in general, a "sheltered" environment helps everyone. I'd like to emphasize that it can help: be part of the solution, or at least not add to the problem. However, also: "You yourselves must strive; the Buddhas only point the way." 

There's a famous story that, eventually, the Buddha vowed not to move until he gained enlightenment. The story can be found for example here: 

Do you have a general technique which, if you remember it, you've discovered that it helps to alleviate hindrances? For example someone referenced the Nissaraniya Sutta recently, which mentions six "means of escape". From this list, for example, perhaps if you remembered "good will", then might that remembrance be enough to escape a hindrance? Or "non-self"? Or perhaps other teachings not on this list, would it help to remember "impermanence" for example, or a doctrine about "craving"? If there are doctrines like that, which you find helpful when you remember them --if you want to remember them but don't-- then might a memory-aid (a semi-permanent sense-object) be useful? A little stone to hold in your hand, or the right word written on a piece of paper? 

What does "aeons of cosmic expansion and cosmic contraction" mean in Buddhist cosmology? Quoting from Dharma: Its Early History in Law, Religion, and Narrative By Alf Hiltebeitel: 

Perhaps we shouldn't "expect" that everyone will behave like (behave as well as) the Bodhisattva: just as not everyone chooses to "go forth into homelessness". In particular I suspect that if most people did this (killed themselves) it would be an act violence. It was partly the Bodhisattva's insight or wisdom, or something like that, which allowed the Bodhisattva to view it as a (praiseworthy) act of generosity instead of as a (blameworthy) act of killing.

I think of avijjā as (quite literally) describing something which you don't have (the a- prefix implies a negative, i.e. an absence of vijjā), and moha as something which you have instead (because you don't have vijjā). There's a round-about definition of avijjā ("ignorance") in SN 35.79 -- where, it says that what's meant by "giving up ignorance" and "giving rise to knowledge" is "seeing impermanence" (in contact and feeling). The next sutta, SN 35.80 says that when ignorance is abandoned, knowledge (i.e. vijjā) arises, wherein "he sees that things are unworthy of attachment". I should add that the dictionary entry for vijjā warns that vijjā:
