According to this question below, apparently a reduction in the regional differences in the level of unemployment would shift the short run Phillips curve SRPC leftwards. The answer to the question is A). I do not see how this could be the case, because "a reduction in the regional differences in the level of unemployment" could mean the regions could either all experience more unemployment, or could all experience less unemployment. I don't see how either scenario would affect the expectation for inflation (in this question it would seem to be a deflationary expectation) to result in a leftwards shift in the SRPC. 

Supply shifts from S to S1, which leads to price rising from P to P1 and quantity exchanged dropping from Q to Q1. Recall the formula for total revenue TR=Price*Quantity, so in the diagram the initial revenue level is OPBQ, and after the tax is OP1AQ1. The change in revenue will depend on the size of the tax and the size of the decrease in quantity consumed. Producer surplus is zero both before and after the tax, while consumer surplus decreases from CBP to CAP1. 

The money market diagram showing liquidity preference and money supply intersect at an equilibrium level of interest rate, but what interest rate is it? Is it the base rate (I presume this is the rate at which commercial banks lend out loans to borrowers) or FED Funds Rate/LIBOR? Or does it simply refer to interest rates in general? 

The fundamental reason, beyond any details about shifting interest rates, is that lenders are in the business of lending money. If you pay off the loan early, then they're doing less business. If you pay off part of the loan, you're paying less interest, which means they have to go out and find another source of income to replace you. Extreme case, suppose you pay off the full loan the very first day, and they don't charge any fees, it's as if they never made a loan at all. They could have stayed in bed. The thought of getting out of bed for nothing makes them so angry (I exaggerate) that they may well charge fees for early repayments and/or setting up the loan in the first place, to ensure that (aside from being paid for their capital) they still get paid for their time. You can think of early repayment fees as making up for any part of the cost of their time that they rolled into the interest rate, although that's not all there is to it. Addressing your specific points: 

So if they can find another customer, they can get back to where they started before you made the early payment. That's not an advantage, that's an opportunity to break even. 

My understanding is that wage differentials should not exist in a perfect labour market for occupations, but the following exam question seems to imply that this can be the case. A brief marking scheme also implies this. 

I have seen sources that claim high interest rates increase the velocity of money circulation, but haven't really seen any concrete explanation for this. This is how I think it works: High interest rates -> high opportunity cost of holding money -> Demand for money decreases -> people dont want to hold money and will spend it -> higher velocity of income. On the other hand,wouldn't a high interest rate make saving more attractive and thus reducing the velocity of income circulation? EDIT: Sources that apparently claim this are referred to below: This source does not explicitly state the relationship but somewhat explains the causes: $URL$ A wikipedia page that seems reasonably credible states this relationship, but I am unable to fully understand their explanation: $URL$ This exam question from Cambridge International Examinations that explicitly states the relationship (the correct answer is D) 

I'm aware of the concept of the multiplier effect, and when I think about it, shouldn't it be possible that government spending on unemployment benefits create a multiplier effect? 

Ben, Let me dispute the premise of the question. A high debt to GDP ratio cannot be bad by itself. The debt to GDP ratio becomes a bad thing when it is too high. Too much alcohol. Too much ice cream. Too much time spent online. These are all bad things because they are too much. But how do you know that these are too much? Let's take alcohol as an example. Too much alcohol can make you do stupid things which you'll later regret. But how much alcohol is too much? When you're with a group of friends and you all drink five or six glasses of beer, and do stupid things together then you're probably having a good time. Drink five or six glasses of beer in the afternoon at the office and you can get fired. This is generally considered a bad thing. The same quantity of alcohol is just right in one situation and too much in another situation because of the consequences. Now you've mentioned some consequences of public debt. The government usually borrows funds to spend it and re-allocate scarce resources. This can be a bad thing, but this can also be a good thing. The United States for example borrowed funds (and compelled its citizens to lend it funds) to fight the Nazi's. This is generally agreed to have been a good thing. The United States also borrowed funds to invade Iraq under George W. Bush. This is something that many individuals considered (ex ante or ex post) to be a bad thing. We can say that when the United States borrowed funds the debt to GDP ratio was high, but it was not too high because the costs were exceeded by the benefits (fewer Nazi's). The resources used could've been used elsewhere but the highest value of those resources was when they were used to decrease the number of Nazi's. Whereas some will argue that when the debt to GDP ratio was increased to invade Iraq, this debt to GDP ratio became too high. The costs were not exceeded by the benefits. The resources could've been used better elsewhere. In addition to the costs of re-allocating resources, there are some other costs of public debt. It has to be repaid through taxation and individuals don't like taxation and it distorts incentives. Some others have argued that a public debt can lead to higher inflation because the central bank might monetize it. Others have argued that it means less private investment as people save in terms of government bonds instead of corporate bonds. And this might eventually lead to lower output due to a decrease in the quantity of capital per inhabitant. There are many other potential costs. And these costs depend on the situation. There is not one economic theory of debt to gdp ratio. There are many economic models that are appropriate to make sense of different situations where the debt to gdp ratio might play a role. Returning to the question why a high debt to GDP ratio is bad, I hope you can see that it isn't. A high debt to GDP ratio is only bad if it is too high. And you can only know whether it is too high when you compare the costs and the benefits of the debt to GDP ratio and these depend on the circumstances. In addition whether it is good or bad is purely subjective. If you think that the consequences are worth it, then it's not bad. Next time that you might encounter a situation where someone declares that something is good or bad try making the distinction between what is and what ought to be. A statement that something is bad implies that the situation should be different and this is premised on a value judgement. You can't arrive at the conclusion that something is bad without a normative premise, a value judgement. The real world consequences of a high public debt to gdp ratio are is up for dispute. We can learn from what we see. But what value you attach to these consequences whether these are good or bad is not up for dispute. It's a preference. Just like chocolate ice cream is better than vanilla is a preference. 

The only possible explanation I can think of is that in the second fiscal year, the government continues to spend, but this time it spends less while not changing tax revenue ("In the absence of offsetting factors"), hence the MS still grows but the following fiscal year's deficit has reduced. 

I'm sure it's one of the three, as they were commonly repeated when I did some research on the internet, but can't quite make out which one it is. 

According to some lecture notes, apparently it is possible for the economy to return to long run equilibrium if via the self-correcting mechanism if there is a temporary shock to the stick wage (horizontal) SRAS. I believe the situation can be graphed as below (SRAS shifting to SRAS1). The problem is I don't see an explanation as to how it will return to long run equilibrium ($Y_f$), other than to let labour markets adjust itself over long periods of time?? 

Since unemployment benefit is a form of government spending, which is a component of aggregate expenditure, then shouldn't unemployment benefits be part of national income measurement? 

When it comes to non-private debt, I hear these three terms the most, but I am not sure if they're interchangeable or discernible. Also, are they recorded in the balance of payments? I'm guessing if they are, they'd be recorded in the transfers part of the current account and the capital and financial accounts. I understand that this is a duplicate question, but my previous question had no contributions other than my own, so I figure it would be sensible to repeat it. 

If they wanted to avoid risk then they could not lend money to you in the first place. They made the loan because they think the interest rate in return for the risk is a good deal. You're ending something they thought was a good deal for them. Lenders do like people who've demonstrated that they can pay off loans, but mainly because it proves that they might be able to take bigger loans in future and generate more income for the lender. What lenders really want, above all else, is the interest[*]. And who they like, most of all, is people who borrow money from them and make the payments. If you pay off early, you're not that person any more. So, why do they even let you make early payments? Firstly because in many cases the law says so, and secondly because they have to offer customers enough flexibility that they'll actually take the deal. This is all in general, of course. There might be specific circumstances where a lender does have a liquidity problem and does want to solve it (in part) by taking as many early repayments as they can. But that's akin to a retailer solving a short-term problem by closing stores: if the solution to your problem is "do less business" then things are pretty bad. Speaking of the market in general rather than retail lending in particular, there are loans that can't be repaid early under the terms that banks might offer for personal loans. For example, a government acting as a borrower can buy back its bonds on the market, but the terms of the bond don't (usually?) allow it to just "pay off the loan early" by requiring the bold holders (lenders) to give them back in return for the bond's face value. They have to pay the market price. [*] For a while they used to like above all else the ability to trade and use as capital reserve, obscure derivatives of the loans, for prices and ratings that amounted to a wild-ass-guess and therefore in many cases were way too high ;-) That became suddenly less respectable in 2008. 

So the scenario is as follows: there are 3 agents and 4 alternatives, $a,b,c,$ and $d$. Society's ranking of the 4 alternatives is such that 

I need verification on my understanding as to whether the following factors affect the demand for money, and if so how they affect it: Changes in Nominal National Income: will affect the transactions motive for money because changes in this will change the amount of money demanded in the economy as more/less will be demanded to buy more/fewer goods and services (shifts the liquidity preference (LP) schedule). Will have little effect on the precautionary motive if nominal national income increases, but the effect may be greater if nominal national income decreases. Changes in nominal national income may change the demand for government bonds (the main asset in focus of the Keynesian model, I presume) and may therefore change the speculative motive of the demand for money as well. Changes in the level of inflation: higher inflation may require a higher demand for money. Changes in the interest rates: results in movements along the liquidity preference curve. The effect is typically stronger on the speculative motive for demanding money. Changes in overall outlook in the economy: a negative outlook may depress speculative spending which may increase the demand for money. I believe these are the main reasons, and would like a verification as to whether what I've written is accurate.
