Domine, conversely, appears to have been used between free, equal men, by children to the head of the household, and Dickey quotes Seneca - "when we run into people whose names we don't remember, we address them as 'master'" (Ep 3.1 author's translation.) "... the contexts are polite but not subservient." observes Dickey (p 88) Dickey even quotes such usages as domine to brothers, and as a term of affectionate respect, as above to fathers. And not just to equals/superiors. 

In my admittedly limited understanding, the notion of specific "servants' quarters" - particularly an atrium - seems anachronistic; according to some ancient writers, slaves should be either working or sleeping, so why would they need an atrium? I have always understood that Romans shoehorned their slaves in wherever there was space, and the notion of providing a room for their own use appears unlikely. I realise history is not linear, but servants' quarters in the sense of the great country houses was a fairly late development; medieval servants bedded down wherever they could! Can anyone resolve my confusion? 

Well, in England the general rule has been, once a bastard always a bastard, with no inheritance rights - and as far as peerages are concerned, this still applies: a child born out of wedlock cannot inherit a title, even if the parents subsequently marry. Kings of course, have broken their own laws when it suited them. The children of John of Gaunt and Katherine Swynford were legitimised to form the Beaufort line which led to Henry VII and the Tudor dynasty. Henry VIII bastardised both Elizabeth and Mary, then made them his heirs after Edward VI -without, intriguingly, legitimising either. Charles II was pressurised to legitimise his son, the Duke of Monmouth, when it became obvious he would be succeeded by his Roman Catholic brother, the Duke of York. He refused, possibly because (personal opinion) he believed he had no right to deprive his brother of his lawful onheritance. So as far as the UK is concerned, the answer is a very qualified "yes" - but only rarely and only by sovereigns. As land was usually entailed on the nearest male blood relative, the owner was basically a life tenant, able to use the land but he could not give it to his favourite natural child at the expense of the lawful heir. He couldn't even give it to his daughters, who were dispossessed if they had no brother - see Jane Austen "Pride and Prejudice" and "Sense and Sensibility". 

In The Anatomy of Melancholy, Burton states that "When the son swore, Diogenes struck the father. " Where did Burton get this from? I can find no earlier (ie Classical) reference to it, nor any suggestion that Diogenes in fact did it. I am wondering if Burton made it up and, as it were," hung" it on Diogenes. 

To the best of my knowledge, they wore the pileus with the toga for life, to indicate they were freed not freeborn. Whether they shaved their hair for life, I have no clue, I'm afraid. 

Not sure this is an appropriate question, but I'll try it anyway. Many Government or quasi-legal roles have traditionally attracted the honorific of "Mr" before them - Mr Speaker, Mr President, Mr Chairman. Since women began filling such roles, they have been addressed, not as Mrs, but as Madam - Speaker, Chairman, etc. This seems to suggest that Mrs (Miss, Ms) is seen as somehow less respectful than "Mr", and I am wondering how this came about. 

So I repeat my original answer. In England, and the UK generally, it is simply not possible for a peer to "grant away" any of his titles. 

Against this, the "slaves' atrium" does appear to lead to the kitchen, and is largely separate from the reception areas of the house. Moreover, in Rome:Its People, Life and Customs, U E Paoli (1958) states that in The House of Pansa, 

They couldn't! All titles were bestowed by the sovereign, you couldn't just say "Oh, I've got a spare earldom etc I don't want, I'll give it to a friend." Apart from any other consideration, your eldest son would be deeply peeved, because he would expect to inherit it! Also, titles were not attached to land in quite the way the question suggests. When Richard III was Duke of Gloucester, his main landholdings were actually in the North not in Gloucester. The title of Duke was a fairly late import - sorry, can't remember when, but after the Norman Conquest - and originally reserved for the ruling dynasty. 

Such marriages were usually part of wider treaties, including a dowry, non-aggression and/or mutual support agreements. The king didn't just get a queen, he got a chunk of land, possible inheritance rights, not to mention preventing his enemies making the same pact with his wife's family. Foreign princesses were mistreated - Catherine of Aragon after Prince Arthur's death, and when Henry 8 divorced her, but I suspect the possible advantages of your daughter/sister being Queen of a foreign power outweighed, in terms of realpolitik, any potential abuse. Amusingly, when Christiana of Denmark was offered the chance of marrying Henry 8, she replied that, had she two necks, the King of England would have been welcome to one of them! 

I would suggest that Western "guilt" over the A-bomb helped to gloss over Japanese atrocities,a phenomenon not limited to the USA. I grew up in post war UK, and as a child thought Germans had horns and tails, whilst I do not remember believing the same about the Japanese. 

Well, I don't know much about bonobos, but many primate communities consist of a group of females /young with a dominant male, who guards his access to females and resources from others. However, I would suggest, off the top of my head, that once property eg fields, woods, etc - became a distinct concept, it was down to who could get it, keep it and defend it - which obviously favoured the stronger male. 

I think you're putting the cart before the horse! grin According to Wikipedia, All modern Thoroughbreds trace back to three stallions imported into England from the Middle East in the late 17th and early 18th centuries: the Byerley Turk (1680s), the Darley Arabian (1704), and the Godolphin Arabian (1729).[17][18] Other stallions of oriental breeding were less influential, but still made noteworthy contributions to the breed. These included the Alcock's Arabian,[19] D'Arcy's White Turk, Leedes Arabian, and Curwen's Bay Barb.[20][21][notes 1] Another was the Brownlow Turk, who, among other attributes, is thought to be largely responsible for the gray coat color in Thoroughbreds.[19] In all, about 160 stallions of Oriental breeding have been traced in the historical record as contributing to the creation of the Thoroughbred. The addition of horses of Eastern bloodlines, whether Arabian, Barb, or Turk, to the native English mares[22] ultimately led to the creation of the General Stud Book (GSB) in 1791 and the practice of official registration of horses.[12] So, before these, there was no such thing as a "thoroughbred" as we use the term today - at least, not in the UK. Can't speak for other countries, but think the English thoroughbred was the "gold standard" for others. $URL$ 

In the 1990's,the former women's services - WRNS, WRAC, and WRAF - were disbanded and women absorbed into the regular services. Whilst women still cannot serve in combat roles, they are armed and undergo the same training as their male counterparts. However, the original transferees would not have had the same training as men - particularly weapons training - and I am wondering how this disparity in skill sets was managed? Also, did women have the option to leave rather than be amalgamated? 

If you compare the interior of Rheims Cathedral (1) with the Great Hall at Castle Howard (4) you will see how different they are. Yes, they are both lofty and enclose large spaces, but there the similarities end. Rheims is linear, leading the eye to the sanctuary and High Altar. Castle Howard is self-referential - it is saying "Look at me" (not God!) And the actual forms are completely at odds; the Great Hall uses round, Romanesque arches, but built on giant pillars, themselves resting on monumental plinths. The statuary is classical, Romans or psuedo-Romans, not saints or Biblical figures. Yet even these "heroic" figures are dwarfed by the scale of the setting, which is literally awe-inspiring. Baroque became the architectural language of power - popular in Catholic, absolutist France, largely rejected in Protestant, constitutional Britain, where it was frequently laughed at. Pope famously remarked about Blenheim :- 

(Mart. 5.57* Dickey, p77 author's translation.) On my main question - how would a slave address a superior not his master, Dickey is clear - 

Probably also to offer some protection to the eyes - a blow from a sword/arrow would hopefully glance or bounce away from the vulnerable area. 

This question Did an English Duke ever grant away an Earldom that he held?" generated so much confusion, including references to courtesy titles and European practice, that I decided to contact the experts on British peerage at the House of Lords. I received a reply from the Assistant Registrar of the Peerage and Baronetage, which he has kindly permitted me to quote. His email includes an analogy with a Trust which, as it is not relevant here, I have omitted. I stated that I believed it was, and always had been, legally impossible for a peer to give away a title he held. Here is his response:- 

Finally we come to the Baroque! Baroque used the Classical forms, but in new and innovative ways. (The term "Baroque" originally meant a defective pearl, and came to mean "eccentric, bizarre".) Where Classical architecture is restrained, Baroque is monumental, tectonic: it handles space in a totally new way - colonnades sweep round, facades advance and retreat, mass is piled upon mass. 3) Blenheim Palace 

Was there any particular reason for this, and why was it considered important enough to be included in the Twelve Tables? 

The area of the The John F Kennedy Memorial at Runnymede, site of the signing of Magna Carta, was gifted to the USA in 1965. Whilst the surrounding gardens are British sovereign territory, the land is owned by the US Federal Government, and the site of the actual memorial is US sovereign territory. 

Dickey makes the point throughout that convention changed over the centuries between Republic (more egalitarian?) and Empire (more deferential?), and the differences between male and female address forms - and I had no idea what a complex and fascinating subject I had embarked on! 

I am just rekindling my interest in Ancient Rome, and reading Rome:Its people, life and customs by Ugo Enrico Paoli. He goes into considerable detail about tables, but only dining tables. There is a whole chapter on writing implements, tablets, parchment, papyrus, stylii, pens,ink etc, but nothing about writing tables or desks. It's perfectly possible to write on a tablet or slate either sitting or standing, but not on parchment or papyrus, needing a flat surface and somewhere for pens, ink etc. And - the Romans wrote a lot - letters, books, laws, poetry, treatises, orders etc. They even had teams of literate slaves writing popular books to dictation. And, not just writing - accounting - one needed a surface of some kind for an abacus or scales. My admittedly small Latin dictionary is no help, it translates "desk" as "scrinium" which then translates as "book box"! So - did the Romans have desks/writing tables? They were a practical people, they must have solved the problem somehow! 

However, according to this discussion of the house, $URL$ the room identified as the slave's atrium is a courtyard, with a compluvium - 

This question is prompted by an earlier question on Roman law, which seemed to suggest that only treason was punishable by death for citizens. I did ask this as comment, but have got intrigued. I am ashamed to name my "source", as it was a murder mystery set in Rome, where it states specifically that the penalty for patricide - being considered a particularly impious crime - was to be flogged, tied in a sack with various unpleasant animals, including a snake, and rolled into the Tiber! Is this arrant nonsense? I'm quite prepared for the answer "Yes!" grin 

Not sure they were the first laws primarily motivated by "moral outrage" but the the effects on the poor of cheap, low quality gin certainly was a factor in passing the British Gin Acts of 1736 and 1751 - cf Hogarth's Gin Lane and Beer Street. $URL$ 

Edit: The nearest I can find to Burton's claim is this (unreferenced) quote: "Why not whip the teacher when the pupil misbehaves?" $URL$ 

A somewhat blunt analysis, but Catholicism was hierarchical and prescriptive, Protestantism more personal and individual - the Bible etc in the vernacular. Kings were appointed by God. To oppose the king was to oppose God Himself - a pretty powerful argument! Cf the English Revolution 1688 when James II tried to claim the Divine Right of Kings'. Who is going to argue with God's chosen, anointed monarch? 

Hardly! I can't put my hand on it now, but I wrote an undergraduate paper on the genesis of US slavery, where I referenced the first documented sale of "Negros" in the American colonies in, I think, 1690. It was fairly obvious from this that it was their difference (perceived as "barbarian", "childlike" and of course non-Christian etc) that made their enslavement acceptable, at least to some, though not to all. Racism made slavery "respectable" - not the other way round. As a PS, I think the idea of "race relations" is an anachronism in the 19th century - and not just in the US. The British looked down on just about everyone who wasn't British! 

Since posting this question, I've begun reading Latin Forms of Address from Plautus to Apuleius by Eleanor Dickey OUP 2002,and the question is considerably more complex than I ever dreamt! For instance:- 

I am confused by a "protocol" that left even a fourteen year old princess standing, when Portland and Keppel, who were commoners, were seated. Edit This, from the admittedly slightly later Court of Louis XVI, adds some context. 

Pope arguably missed the point. The Baroque was no more about comfort than it was about religion. It was power and magnificence in stone. Recommended : 50 Architecture Ideas you need to know Philip Wilkinson London 2010 (All illustrations from relevant Wikipedia pages.) 

Art competitions at the Olympics were always controversial, largely because of the professional standing of many of the participants, when the Olympics was supposed to be all amateur. Music was not the only discipline in which only some - or no - medals were awarded see:- $URL$ 

When the Renaissance rediscovered Classical Greco-Roman architecture, Gothic was seen as a debased style; the very term "Gothic", suggesting barbarous and uncivilised, was a term of abuse. The "Classical language" of Greco-Roman architecture was revived, influenced by people like Palladio. Classical architecture rejected the flamboyance of the Gothic for restraint, harmony and proportion. 2) Chiswick House, London 

I have always understood they were free, paid for by the rich elite to woo/placate the general populace - hence the phrase "bread and circuses". According to the Wikipedia article you cite, the various levels were based on rank, not price. And IIRC, women were relegated to the topmost tier in case they got too... friendly.. with the gladiators - women were not all poor! Edit re references It seems even the experts disagree - with themselves! In this article Cartwright states that the games were "probably free", whereas here he states that tickets were sold for the Colosseum. Very confusing! 

I think the short and simple answer is "No". Seneca in one of his letters recommends treating slaves kindly, as "friends, humble friends but friends" - but says nothing about not having any. Earlier, Cicero was writing to Tiro (I'm fairly certain before the latter's manumission) with great concern for his, Tiro's, health, calls him "best and kindest of men", etc - yet at the same time asks his friend Atticus to send him some library-slaves, as we would ask to borrow a neighbour's lawn mower. And I think Christianity has claimed/been given too much credit for softening/ending slavery. St Paul's famous exhortation of "Slaves, obey your masters..." suggests no ethical dilemma. He did not say - "Masters, free your slaves." The Roman adage "Quod servi, quod hostes" - meaning that you had as many enemies as you had slaves, suggests a philosophical acceptance of a fact of life, like traffic accidents. You needed slaves to do the grunt work; they might kill you, but - well, what could you do? A necessary evil, maybe, but not a source of guilt.
