This boils down to the age old question of "can crime be eliminated"? The short version is no. Over a long enough time scale, some poor sod will break the law, either out of ignorance or malice. As for why someone might break the law considering the penalties are so harsh. It's a cost-benefit question. After all, you can only be punished if you are caught, and also convicted. Thus a good lawyer and/or some crafty planning will let you get away with it. If we assume that the judges are all-knowing, mind-reading gods, and that all judgements are true and fair, then we can still fall back on the person only being convicted if caught, so they could just become a fugitive, after all the punishment doesn't get much worse for each subsequent crime. A person treated like X becomes X, because there is no possible downside to doing so. The way they are treated will not change. This is a flaw in all extreme punishments. Once you cross the line, there's no, or little harm in crossing it more. Thus, in such a system you would have no minor crime, and the occasional murderous rampage. EDIT: Extra information has been provided by the creator, thus some clarification is required. The Church has some way of determining a corpse's crimes This changes a few things. Now it is an invetibality that if caught, a fugitive will be subjected to their torture/punishment (whether they are executed first or not). In this scenario, these people have two major options: 

Yes, of course. Our lungs do this. The type of membrane you want is a semi-permeable membrane. The material used for this would be similar to mammalian veins, as they perform gas exchange in our bodies. 

There are two approaches you could take here. Semi-Permeable Membranes Membranes of this type allow only certain ions or particles via diffusion or passive/active transport. A dialysis machine for example uses this sort of membrane. For ion transport, these require a carrier fluid. Oxygen, Nitrogen and CO2 are all mildly soluble in water, so we could use something water-based as the carrier. In this situation, the membrane is just a sieve with an extremely fine mesh size. Well-controlled, this mesh would only allow your selected compounds through. Sickness or mutation could cause this to malfunction in similar ways to how kidney disease affects humans. Interestingly, this means that compounds with a similar physical size to your usual source will be allowed through. This is similar to why carbon monoxide ends up in our bloodstream. It has a similar size and charge to oxygen, and thus gets through the sieve. To prevent poisoning via these chemicals, a secondary mechanism is present in most complex life forms. Biochemical Filters Our liver is one of these. It uses various enzymes and chemical pathways to process chemicals in our bloodstream, and neutralise toxins. This type of filter is often employed after initial size and charge filtering via the normal input pathway (the lungs in this case). Let me get back to your question. 

With a couple of changes to our perspective, it could be quite a bit lower than we would assume. We wouldn't need anywhere near as many different semiconductors as we have to be high tech. A lot of specialized chips could be replaced with general-purpose computing chips, perhaps with some inefficiency in size, speed, power usage, etc., but traded off against efficiencies in manufacturing and logistics and the number of people needed. If we didn't design everything to be disposable or for planned obsolescence, we wouldn't need to keep making new chips with trivial differences that in the end do the exact same things for the end-user. This needn't mean stagnation, innovation could be more significant though less frequent. Pharmaceuticals are largely driven by profit and guesswork. We could probably maintain tech levels but with a lot less complexity and people needed if we had better tech to know which medicines were needed (instead of the "try this and if it doesn't work we'll try something else" approach). Also if we were willing to accept some tradeoffs - many drugs are effective at treating multiple problems. In addition, a lot of the population does things that are not strictly necessary for maintaining a high-tech society but are a convenience or a luxury. While not everyone is going to want to be a research engineer, if we can reallocate over time and increase the ratio of population working on research, production, and development or the support thereof, we would need a lower population to sustain it. On a space colony, this would be a must. The way our economy is structured, with extreme specialization, it would most likely take millions or tens of millions or more. But if we made some tradeoffs for efficiency and generalization and restructured the economy to support it, then a population in the tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands (or possibly lower) could potentially work. (Once infrastructure is setup and automation applied where possible). 

If you're requiring everyone to work the same hours, one big detrimental effect is that everyone who relies on the previous shift would be unable to do their jobs. The hours when businesses are closed are times are when much of the cleaning, maintenance, repair, shipping, receiving, stocking, and processing goes on. Without that, employees who arrived in the morning would be idle until that work was done, businesses would not be able to function anywhere near capacity, and productivity would plummet. Another major detrimental effect would be that the entire consumer economy would be shut down. Since all the stores, restaurants, and entertainment venues (such as those soccer stadiums) would only be open while everyone was at work and couldn't go, no one would be able to spend money and all of those businesses would go bankrupt. Travel, transportation, and tourism would also be affected. Something would need to be done to support all those who previously worked multiple jobs or shifts, or worked nights/weekends because they were going to school or taking care of family. That would significantly impact whatever is in place to care for the poor. Interestingly, your exemptions of domestic workers, mom & pop firms & construction companies, sound like some of the ones that would be least affected. 

Actually, it would require a square of the effort, as pressure is force per unit area. And that's before we consider the resistance of the filter. It's infeasible for any creature to go much past its normal intake pressure due to this. 

Filtering CO with only a semi-permeable membrane is impossible, due to its similar size to O2. Thus, to satisfy all conditions, we need some mechanism that will separate out unwanted chemicals (preferably in a way that doesn't poison the animal), and then allow the required chemicals (oxygen) into a semi-permeable membrane for a final size pass. The setup that would achieve this is a biochemical filter that feeds into our semi-permeable membrane, and finally into the bloodstream. This has some important implications. The creature will probably have no way of dealing with chemicals that do end inside its blood, such as dissolved CO in liquids, and thus there is a variety of liquids (and solids) that would decompose in the body and become toxic. This is the equivalent of injecting ethanol into someone. You're bypassing the liver, which would normally deal with it. Besides this, its breathing liver (if you will), would need to be able to neutralise a variety of harmful chemicals. Due to how absurdly complex biochemistry is, there probably exists some gas that will get through the filter and come out toxic (this is why methanol kills humans but ethanol does not. Neither are very toxic in the first order, however the same chemical pathway that turns ethanol into vinegar, turns methanol into formic acid, which is quite toxic). Thus it's impossible to have a creature that will survive all airborne contaminants. There will exist some situation in which they'll need a gas mask. However you can have a creature that can deal with most commonly found contaminants on the planet upon which they reside, with analogues to those contaminants being toxic. 

Not necessarily. Logistics The answer to any question of "should we do X" can always be rephrased as "is the benefit of doing X greater than the cost(s) of doing X". So let's rephrase: In a civilisation that has access to tonnes of planets, would vertical farming outweigh the cost of setting up the farms? For certain planets, the answer would be yes. Temperate planets that are close to existing hub worlds for example would have low cost of transport for goods manufactured on them (food included), thus more extreme forms of manufacturing (such as vertical farms) could be utilised before it becomes inefficient to build more dense and/or complex systems. It's not just a matter of the space required, but also the world's climate (and how easily it can be terraformed), as well as how it relates to the economy at large. If it is in a convenient location, or is highly abundant in a particular resource, then it may be worth it to employ advanced engineering techniques to maximise the utility of that planet.
