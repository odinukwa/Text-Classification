Given that you'll pay specialty baggage fees to transport your own bike to and from Italy, the hassle and expense of buying a bike suitcase or box, and storing it, you might be better off renting a bicycle while you are there, if your trip is less than two weeks long and you are flying from the USA. If, however, you are flying within the EU or your trip is longer, it might be cheaper to bring your bike. Example 1: Flying from USA From the USA, the fees would be US$300 ($150 each way) if you flew on Delta to Italy: 

That said, I like my Dahon as it's easy to fold, slip into its carry bag, and take on the train. Mine is one of the lighter versions, just around 12kg (25 pounds) so it's still luggable. I've taken it all over Japan, from northern Hokkaido to western Honshu. 

When the two bicycles are going in a straight line, it would be fine if there were four wheels touching the ground. The connection has to be rigid otherwise when the parent brakes, the child would ram into them. 

In comparison, a bog-standard 700c hybrid bike at the bike shop with 3x9 speeds is going to have around 24" on the low end and 116" on the high end -- a range of over 4.8x. It's going to be both much easier going uphill on the hybrid (24" versus your 33") as well as much faster downhill and in the straightaways (116" vs. your 66"). Standard (big) bikes also have full length cranks - sometimes our folding bikes come with kid-size cranks which also reduces leverage uphills. You can do some things to improve the overall spread and to reduce the gearing to make it easier to go uphill. You could replace the 14-28T 7-speed cassette with a 11-32T which has a larger spread so it would help a bit going downhill as well as uphill. In addition, you could reduce the size of your chainwheel from 52T to something like 48T to again help with the hills. I'd recommend against an 11T sprocket on a 20" wheel as there will be a lot of wear on the teeth and so you'll chew up your chain and sprocket really quickly. With a more reasonable 13-34T cassette and 48T chainwheel, for example you'd get 27.5" - 85" gear inches which should be enough for many purposes. You're limited in modding by the capacity of your rear derailleur -- and if you swap it out with a long cage, it may drag on the ground on corners. The standard Shimano Tourney 7-speed on your bike seems to be ok - most models in that series are specced for 11-34T capacity. I should also note though that some sprocket/chainwheel/chain lengths may no longer allow the bike to fold smoothly or result in the chain derailing when you fold, so you'll need to fiddle a bit. If it were my bike, I'd look at the terrain and make the decision. For my Brompton, for example, I got a smaller chainwheel as I live in a hilly neighborhood and needed the reduction in gear inches and don't mind my top-speed being limited. I had to take a few links out of the chain but it still folds ok. Finally, I should note that even at the same gearing it's harder to go uphill with a small-wheel folding bicycle than it is a full-size bicycle. Our tires are smaller so they have less stability (less gyroscopic effect/leverage); our cranks are shorter so we have less leverage; and our steering is squirrelly so it's harder to go in a straight line. 

With one of these babies, your pizza (or ramen) will not sway from side to side, bump around, and end up all mashed into one big congealed mess. Of course, it costs around $400 and you can only get it in Japan. But if you're serious about your pizza carrying, it's the only way to go. 

A trick that Japanese schoolgirls use to keep their knee-high socks up is some rubber glue(the stationery kind not the bicycle kind). It’s easy to apply, won’t come off with moisture (sweat), but is easy to rub off the skin at the end of the day. 

A bunch of manufacturers including Dia-compe used to sell brake levers that were reversed and there are also some contemporary reproductions: 

A 100 watt solar panel is nominal watts under ideal situations. You'll be lucky to get 25 watts/hr tied to the back of your bike - and this would be only for a few hours of the day, from 11a to 3p. Given that your bike is likely using at least 100-200 watts/hr even on low pedal assist, you're only going to gain 5-10% more range over the entire day. From experience, even with low pedal assist, its highly unlikely you'll get anywhere near the maximum (or even middle) advertised range of the ebike. There is a further complication that your battery management system won't allow you to charge while biking. Many if not most don't. So you can only charge the spare pack and you'll have to figure out how to convert the solar panel to the right D.C. voltage and amperage for your charger. If you overcharge or overvolt, a poorly design lithium pack can go up in flames. It'd be much easier and safer logistically to just bring another spare battery pack or two. I assume you'll be pulling trailers and as a result your mileage will be even further reduced but it means you can carry more. Just load up your trailer with spare packs and bring multiple chargers. Forget solar, it's not worth the hassle. The one exception would be to use solar to charge your iPhone/iPad and other electronic devices -- it's relatively easy to find small solar chargers that have USB leads. 

A credit card usually does the trick. It's flexible enough to bend slightly but firm enough to serve as a scraper/pusher. It's soft enough that it won't scratch most finishes. 

NB: Your bottom bracket and axles are oriented perpendicular to the wind when on a roof rack so they'll get less water driven into them. 

The problem is that the metal fender (or fender bracket) has some spring in it and wants to spring back placing constant tension on the plastic retaining bits that hold the slider. Ideally, the sliders should not be under any tension or compression - they just should keep the fender from some side to side and a little of fore and aft movement. If you have a metal fender: I would bend the fender so that it's closer to the wheel even when under no tension: 

For centering? For anti-rotation? For dropping on the garage floor and rolling under the table? A legacy of the great spring controversy of 1913? 

Both of these are inexpensive repairs. The pad replacement you can do yourself. The cable replacement you can do yourself if you have your shop cut the outers to the right length (or if you get your own bicycle brake outer cable cutters). 

If you can move your handlebars separately from your fork, you have to tighten up your stem quill more using that little hex bolt. Sheldon again has a wonderful diagram of the wedge bolt. 

If you have the 315hc model with the speed/cadence sensor then there can be a discrepancy if your wheel size is entered incorrectly. Strava prefers wheel sensors over GPS because of GPS update frequency issues that the other answer notes has its own proprietary way of calculating distance (most likely also incorporating other people's data who have used the same route) that doesn't correspond to your wheel-distance or gps-distance as calculated by your GPS. 

Note that the large threaded locknut and top race on the threaded part of the headset has nothing to do with the connection with the handlebar, which uses a stem quill into the steerer tube (See the Sheldon's site for details). You tighten up the top race/locknut only if you feel "looseness" between the handlebars/fork and the frame. 

This happened on my Trek Pilot. The pedal was a bit loose and I didn't fix it in time before it bore itself out of its hole. My LBS drilled out the threads and installed a new helicoil. It's a simple task, I think I paid less than $30 for it (although I did get a friend-of-the-shop discount, you might pay more). Park Tools has instructions on how to drill and then tap a new bushing: $URL$ 

At first glance, these handlebars appear to be very dangerous. There are multiple points of failure any of which would immediately render the bike not only steerable but likely not allow the operator to brake either: 

There is also some physical factors that also play a role, notably the brakes. Most folding bikes have 20" or smaller wheels. Because the wheels are smaller, the tires have to be wider to provide resilience and suspension. The brakes also have to be stronger and "grabbier" because the smaller wheel torques on the brakes more. So you want cantilever or V-brakes for the reach around the fat tire -- or disc-brakes. Final nail in the casket, you have to consider which brake handle styles have the right pull ratio given that folders don't have drops. One of the few folding bikes that has road-style caliper brakes is the Brompton - and it has custom brake levers and has been heavily criticized for its poor braking. One of the few folding bikes with drops and calipers is the Tern Verge X18 below, which is a niche-niche bike. So in general, considering cost and effectiveness, you end up with mtb style brakes and brake levers. Christian Lindig has also mentioned the derailleur but there are some considerations there (long-cage mountain derailleurs don't work on stubby wheels) that complicate a response. 

Unlike mechanical (cable) disc brakes which feature a brake pad spring and where you have to adjust pad distance manually; hydraulic disc brake pad distance is regulated automatically and many hydros have no piston retraction spring at all. Does the lack of pad distance adjustment make hydraulic disc brakes more susceptible to rubbing on slightly warped rotors? 

Baked on grease can look yellow or the manufacturer might have coated it with something. In this case, it looks like the manufacturer gave it a light coating. Normally the lube from your chain (especially if you use a tacky lube) is enough to prevent corrosion. But if you're worried, why not just give it an extra coating of silicone oil. For bare metal parts, I also use Boeshield, figuring if it's good enough for BOEing to SHIELD aeronautical parts from corrosion, it's good enough for my bike. I use it on places like hex bolt heads which seem to attract corrosion but you could also use inside your cassette. Fineprints: But (along the lines of what @Criggie points out) it might be cheaper to buy a new freewheel than a can of Boeshield... Another side note is that using an acid to strip rust can be a bad idea because it leaves the exposed metal in a particularly vulnerable state for corrosion. Because rust on the sides of the sprockets really doesn't hurt you, I would have just degreased with a citrus degreaser and left the rust alone -- or bought a new freewheel. 

You could sew your own patches on using canvas and high-strength thread. They even sell kevlar thread that's useful for this type of thing. If it were my panniers and I prefer strong-but-ugly, then I would cut up an old inner tube and use those as my patch materials. There's a very strong contact cement called Pliobond that you can use to glue pretty much any flexible material to another one. You can even make your patches from leather (still using Pliobond) or canvas (ditto). I've bonded leather and rubber to steel/aluminum using Pliobond. Or you can lame out and go to your local outdoor store that sells a broad variety of patch materials for backpacks and tents: $URL$ Many backpackers, for example, use "Shoe Goo" to not only repair their shoes (you can craft new soles with it) but also patch rather large holes in their backpacks. Sugru is also useful for this type of repair. 

Fine print: More accurately, it’s to assuage the worries of the parents that are buying the BMX for their young male child that they might not have grandchildren. Actually efficacy for such purpose is under debate. 

I ended up with the third option as it was the easiest. All these should be doable in conversation with your bike shop. Also, since you are likely buying a new child carrier, you have two other options: 

Yes, in fact you should cut it down because it's both a safety hazard (easy to gouge your ankles on an exposed bolt) as well as maintenance issue (it's easy to bend the exposed axle bolt and thus make it very difficult to unscrew the QR nut). There are two ways to cut it, the first is on the bike and the second is off the bike. On the bike: 

It's called a barrel adjuster. Why do you need a Campagnolo one? If it fits, it works. If you really want a Campy, I'd try eBay now that you know what it's called. The one in the top left has the flat side you want. Note that a non-Campy adjuster would be 2-5 eurodollars each.... 

First, you need to measure the current at close-to-stall which is when electric motors draw the most current. Ideally, you’d have a dyno or rollers but with bikes wheel traction on the rollers can be a problem. So I’d try to stall the wheel with your brakes. Only do it in short spurts to not overheat the brake or hub or controller. Scenarios (note by fake I mean re-labeled): 

I was reading the Sept 2016 issue of Bicycling where they were reviewing the SRAM NX series. The blurb for the SRAM chain (below) states that "The PC-1110 chain SRAM recommends for NX ... has performed its duties as well as SRAM's higher -end stuff. And because it hasn't had premium hardening treatments, it actually may be gentler on your cassette and ring than a more expensive chain." 

Just to clarify Batman's answer. SRAM has the same pull ratio for front derailleurs as Shimano. For the rear, SRAM has a different rear pull ratio (described by SRAM as 1:1 rather than 2:1) so each 'click' of an SRAM shifter will shift about two sprockets of a Shimano derailleur. Some SRAM shifters have a switch that allow you to convert to Shimano pull ratios -- and SRAM sells some shifters that are only-Shimano compatible. However, since you're replacing the rear derailleur, I would stick with Shimano as SRAM doesn't sell any Shimano 2:1 pull compatible rear derailleurs. 

Chain tools are relatively cheap but make sure it is compatible with the "speed" of your bike. I.e., if you have a nine speed chain make sure you have a nine speed compatible chain tool. This is because the diameter of the pin on the tool that pushes in the link pin has to be smaller than the bushings of the chain. Lower 'speed' tools have wider pins and might damage your chain bushings. 

Clearly there second has a more complicated linkage, but what is the twin-link four-bar suspension design trying to solve? The twin-link seems to have a bigger virtual pivot point and the magnified axle path seems to swerve less laterally, but it's hard to tell from the exaggerated diagram.
