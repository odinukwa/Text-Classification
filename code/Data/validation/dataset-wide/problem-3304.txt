In many languages the word-form after a numeral can be considered a separate case. For instance, in English we say "five million" instead of "five millions". In Russian the word for million would be plural in this case, but, say, the word for "gram" would be in singular form: 

There is a consensus that all stages of PIE from oldest (Indo-Hittite) to the latest fit into the interval from 4000 BC to 3000 BC. There is no room to stretch this interval in any way. We know that, say, Proto-Greek was so much similar to late PIE that there is no doubt that there was no more than a few centuries separating the both. 

What this means is that in English you use word order to convey some information, in Russian you use inflection, and in German you use punctuation. Russian also does not need a comma here. 

Is there any language where there exist words for smells not derived or already disconnected from words for smelling objects? For instance, those derived from verbs, of obscure etymology, or not having the corresponding noun in the contemporary language? For other feelings there are: bitter - from a verb yellow - gholtos apparently already meant yellow color at PIE stage sweet - su̯ea̯dus already meant "sweet" in PIE red - e̯roudhros already meant "red" in PIE sour - from PIE word for cheese seuros, but long forgotten since. I am looking for words meaning particular smells, not just "good smell" or "bad smell". 

In English unlike other languages most words should be just learned. In really confusing cases they use hyphen to separate semantic parts like in "no-where". 

There is also a calque for "et cetra", also can be abbreviated. For post-scriptum "P.S." there is a calque as well, it even uses the same sounding initial letters: "prodolzhenie sleduet" ("continuation follows"). 

The idea of zero endings is quite useful in PIE studies. Consider for example, two words: nebhos has no ending nepōt has zero ending This is because the first one is of Neuter gender while the second one is Masculine. The role of ending is played by the longer vowel in final syllable. Also a zero ending can be a case marker. For instance, in Nomenative Russian word папа "father" has ending -a, but in Vocative it has zero ending: пап. This is the only singular case where the word has no ending. 

The -ios/-i̯os nouns/adjectives usually meant the origin or belonging of the thing, for instance, nea̯ui̯os "of a ship", smğelbhi̯os "of the same womb, uterine", su̯oini̯os "wife's sister's husband" (from su̯oinia̯ "wife's sister"), su̯esri̯os "sister's son". This possibly developed from Locative case whose ending was -i. Thus, su̯esri would mean "at the sister", nea̯ui would mean "on a/the ship". Also used as comparative as in seni̯os "older". The -ter nouns meant agents. Those whose job, work, or design was to do some function. Thus, censter meant "speaker", doma̯ter meant "tamer", peq̆ter meant "cook". This suffix also was used for the terms for relatives. The -tor suffix also created the agent noun but it meant somebody who did the action irrespective of whether it was his usual occupation. Thus, if peq̆ter meant "cook", peq̆tor would mean the one who cooked (a thing). The -teros suffix meant roughly the same as -ward suffix in English or comparative. The one of a pair who has the quality manifested the most. Such as in decsteros "the one more to the right", u̯eiteros "the more far one", e̯enteros "the inner one". The -istos suffix meant superlative. Thus, ğra̯uistos meant "heaviest", dlonghistos meant "longest", a̯ristos meant "of the best sort". Another superlative suffix was -mmos/-immos/-ismmos/-tmmos as in e̯eĝhstmmos "outermost" The -trom, -dhrom, -tlom, -dhlom suffixes meant instruments and tools. Thus a̯ero̯trom "plow", seddhlom "saddle", see̯tlom "sieve" etc. The -ia̯/-a̯ suffixes meant collective number, abstract things and feminine gender. Thus preu̯ia̯ "mistress", neptia̯ "female nephew". The -r/-n alternating stems belonged to the very ancient nouns, such as u̯odr "water" (gen. u̯edns, adj u̯odnos), u̯esr "spring" etc. The -mn suffix meant neuter(non-animate) nouns, having certain properties. Such as a̯eĝmn "train", e̯neo̯mn "name", ĝneo̯mn "sign", see̯mn "seed". The -kos suffix indicated material composition or origin. Such as in leukos "bright", a̯i̯uenkos "young". The -ikos suffix meant "having to do with..." The -iskos suffix indicated affiliation or place of origin. The -ros was the default adjectival suffix as in a̯rĝros "shining" The -tos suffix formed possessive adjectives (having X). The -mos suffix produced action and event nouns such as in ğhermos "warmth, heat", sreumos "stream". The -los was used for creating deminutives. The -u̯ents suffix meant "rich in". There were other suffixes as well. 

What is the origin of the Latin suffix -alis/-alia? Can it be an Etruscan borrowing? Is Russian adjectival suffix -аль- a borrowing from Latin? 

In PIE the verb was e̯esmi/e̯essi/e̯esti (I/you/he is). As such the Armenian word cannot be inherited from PIE. 

If you want an auxiliary language closer to Italian, consider Interlingua. Unlike Esperanto it is closely based on Latin and other Romance languages. Esperanto most likely will not help. 

The English word "right" comes from Proto-Indo-European word o̯reĝtos which meant "correct" and had cognates o̯reĝr "directive, order", o̯reĝs "king, ruler", o̯reĝti "guides, directs", o̯reĝi̯om "kingdom". The root itself meant "direct, straight" and reflected in many English words both inherited and borrowed, such as "direction", "correction", "rectum", "region". The Russian and Polish word "pravo" originates from a different PIE root and cognate with the English word "first" and German word "Frau". The basic meaning of the root "per-" was "over", "through" as in PIE adverb peri, but later the meaning also shifted to "against" as in proti, "forward, ahead" and further to "first" as in prou̯os. The later word, prou̯os, meaning "first" was used to designate a province headsman ("first" in the settlement), and later "judge" and "lord" (with feminine form preu̯ia̯ meaning "mistress, lady", reflected in German "Frau") and gave rise to the Slavic legal term as well as the Russian terms meaning "correct", "just". 

In English "of" is used to mark Genitive semantic case (though English lacks Genitive morphological case). There is nothing more to it. So, the one-word answer: Genitive. 

The second person singular pronoun in PIE was tua̯om (or tue̯om). This explains why many languages have t- in the first position in second-person pronoun. There was no third-person personal pronoun in PIE. In such cases one could use either demonstrative (like "that") or reflexive (like "themself"). The reflexive pronoun su̯em in PIE was one for all persons (unlike English where you see "yourself", "himself") etc. The demonstrative pronouns (like "that") were so for masculine, sea̯ for feminine and tod for neuter. Looking at this you can see that both reflexive and the demonstratives could be the origin for s- in third person pronouns in descendant languages. 

In PIE we have du̯is twice du̯iteros second du̯oi̯os twofold du̯eiplos double etc, with the root du̯ei̯- At the same time we have: du̯eiros fearful du̯eisos hated with seemingly the same root. Is there any etymological or semantic connection? P.S. After making this post I found that de Vaan postulates the following: *dus 'into two > bad' 

This text is from: A dictionary of Greek and Roman biography and mythology, 1873 (ed. William Smith). $URL$ So here is the account by Eustathius (although it seems he in turn refers to Arianos): 

My dictionary does not give "prei" but gives prea̯i, a prepositional adverb. It is formed by adding the locative ending -i, in a similar way like other prepositional adverbs are formed: a̯enti, ndheri, medhi. It meant "in the front, before", but also could mean "near, at" (consider for instance its Russian derivative "pri" "near, at"). So something like prea̯iu̯os logically would mean "the thing at/near somebody". 

Is there a law that prohibits PIE stems starting with what traditionally reconstructed as non-palatal /g/? So far I encountered with only one stem that the sources consistently reconstruct with this phoneme: gloiu̯os "clay". Is this stem reconstructed reliably? Cannot it be a borrowing? Note that I know about a prohibition on stems starting with "r-". 

If we take a clitic as a part of word that is attached after the ending and attached to the word depending on the word order (examples include -'s in English and -que in Latin), what would be definite articles in languages such as Bulgarian and Danish? Are they clitics or endings? 

I think it is natural that final calculation has the "under-" prefix because when you sum up things, you write the result under the summed up data. 

In Russian the gender is defined by the form of the word. A word ending with -a or -я is usually feminine, a word ending with -e or -o is usually neuter. There are also words that end in -ь which can be either feminine or masculine, but I do not know a single word that changed a gender. 

It seems to me that the most languages have either complicated morphology or very strict word order. Are there languages with simple morphology and free word order (for instance, indicating relationships of words mostly with prepositions)? 

"Language isolate" is a vague term. For nearly all languages in the world there are conjectured affiliations. For example, Etruscan is supposed to be Eurasiatic, Basque is supposed to belong to Dene-Caucasian and so on. For all languages in China it is known that they are either Dene-Caucasian or Nostratic. The same can be said about Russia and Europe. 

Slavic plávati definitely related to English flow and float and derived from PIE pleu- (e.g. pleuti "swims"). Starling derives it from Eurasiatic ṗVlV "wash, flow". This does not support any theory because Thai languages do not belong neither to Eurasiatic not to a higher groupping of Nostratic. Your idea would be much more probable if you found parallels between Russian and Greenlandic or Japanese. You should note that there are many much more striking coincidences. For example, you would be surprised that English "strange" is not related to Russian "stranno" which means the same, and English "sport" is not related to Gothic "spords" which means "racing". 

The feminine suffix in PIE is believed to be -i̯ea̯, though the ablaut grade in nominative is not certain. Traditionally reconstructed as -i̯ea̯ (because of long vowels in Latin), but Beekes hypothesizes that the Nominative form was -ia̯, while in other cases it could become -i̯ea̯. A form -a̯/-ea̯ also can be seen in some words. The suffix is believed to originate from the suffix -ia̯ for collective number. Some reconstructed PIE words with the suffix include a̯oldhia̯ a dugout boat a̯eua̯ia̯ grandmother bhrea̯tria̯ brotherhood colia̯ hiding place, dug-out e̯rudhia̯ rust deiu̯ia̯ goddess e̯sntia̯ being ma̯eghu̯ia̯ young woman neptia̯ nephew (fem) pie̯u̯eria̯ fat woman preu̯ia̯ lady, mistress potnia̯ lady u̯eĝhia̯ track, road 

I think it is quite widespread in Russian. The main competition happens between the -а/-я and -и/-ы forms, which were historically derived from PIE dual and plural. тон "tone" - тона (about colors) - тоны (about sounds) хлеб "bread" - хлебы (about bakery products) - хлеба (about kinds of grasses) цех "plant workshop" or "medieval guild" - цеха "plant workshops" - цехи "guilds" год "year" - года (as in "years passed", "in your years/age") - годы (as "in the 1990s years", "the years of youth", also can replace года everywhere) Some forms can be used interchangeably: слесарь - слесари/слесаря шторм - штормы/шторма
