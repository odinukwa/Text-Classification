The $£2000$ appears in GDP in 2000, as production (less intermediate goods consumed) and as value added (the wages of the builders and profit of the developer) and as expenditure (capital formation or investment by the original buyer). The $£2500$ actually does appear twice in 2001, once positively (by the new buyer) and once negatively (by the seller), as fixed capital formation in the expenditure measure of GDP. So in aggregate this cancels out and does not add to GDP in 2001 (correctly so, as no value has been added in 2001 - equivalently there has been no production in 2001), but might appear in more detailed elements of the national accounts, for example if the new buyer was an individual while the seller was part of government. 

The second expression is an approximation which works reasonably well for small inflation $I$ but badly for high $I$ Suppose the inflation rate is $I=300\%$ (i.e. prices this year are four times what they were a year ago) and nominal interest rates were $N=100\%$ (i.e. nominally your savings doubled in a year). Then, in real terms after interest, your savings could buy half the stuff it previously could and the real interest rate was $\frac{N-I}{1+I}=-50\%$ while $N-I=-200\%$ Instead suppose the inflation rate is $I=3\%$ and nominal interest rates were $N=1\%$. Then the real interest rate was $\frac{N-I}{1+I}\approx-1.94\%$ while $N-I=-2\%$, fairly close 

No, since you can change the Gini coefficient by altering the distribution of incomes in the top half (keeping the total the same) without changing the mean or median income; you can also change the Gini coefficient by altering the distribution of incomes in the bottom half without changing the mean or median income. Compare the Gini coefficients of {2,2,2,2,2,6,10,10,10,10,10} and of {1,1,1,1,6,6,6,6,6,6,26}: the former will have a Gini index of about 0.33 while the latter will have a Gini index of about 0.46 though the mean and median do not change (6 each) 

Your first country producing cars (possibly after receiving investment or loans from others) has an economy, and if it is selling cars then it can buy other things in exchange for cars. It could even buy some gold. So it has a degree of economic power, but so too do its investors, suppliers and customers. Your second country sitting on a pot of gold and doing nothing (it may as well have left the gold in the ground) has no economy and no economic power until it changes that position. For example it cannot buy more gold as it has nothing to use to pay for it except gold. Only after it has sold gold for something useful or productive might things change. By the way, GDP (on the production measure) is actually the market value of all goods and services produced, less the value of intermediate goods and services consumed. In a closed economy with no international trade, this is equal to all final goods and services produced (adjusted for the change in stocks of intermediate goods and services) but in an open economy in international supply chains it can be very different. 

The United States prioritises the second and third, and only worries slightly about the first and its impact on trade. Being an extremely large economy, capital inflows can only make a small difference to domestic market conditions, though during the world financial crisis some moments of fear did tend to push the relative price of the dollar up as international money sought a safe haven (abbreviated to risk-off sentiments). Currently it seems that the US can make moderate increases to interest rates in contrast to Europe or Japan, without a major impact on US exchange rates China prioritises the third and also the first in a managed exchange rate sense. There are significant capital controls in China (more now than a few years ago), and they make it difficult for short-term capital flows to cross the border in either direction. If somebody abroad wants to buy yuan-denominated shares or bonds, they will find it much easier in the rather peculiar markets in Hong Kong than in the domestic markets in Shanghai and the two often disconnect with significantly different prices for similar investments. This enables the Chinese government to pursue a domestic monetary policy without too many international concerns A small open economy cannot follow the US example (being too small) or the Chinese example (being too open). And in many cases smaller countries are more affected by international trade than similarly structured larger ones. So the exchange rate implications of changes in domestic monetary policy are more important to small open economies 

Your statement "Portfolio Equity is about stocks/shares, whereas Portfolio Debt is about bonds" is essentially correct, with the associated income being dividends and coupons respectively Direct investment (FDI) has the associated income of profits, while other debts may have the associated income of interest (if any) Chapter 6 and other chapters of the IMF Balance of Payments Manual discuss these issues 

ceteris paribus - other things staying the same What happens with a changing money supply depends on what other things stay the same in your thought experiment. Possibilities might include: 

You could say what the chart represents. It is in fact the changes in the input Producer Price Index $URL$ with a headline statement of 

These are theories, so need empirical justification. They may not be true, and even if they appear to be true they may still be wrong about the cause and effect. If you regard your first statement as saying that people with increased monetary wealth will want to see a income increase from this wealth then they will buy bonds and other less liquid investments pushing interest rates down, and your second statement as saying that people with increased non-monetary wealth will want to see an increase in liquid assets such as money so they can spend some of their wealth then they will sell bonds and other less liquid investments pushing interest rates up, you will find there is no intrinsic contradiction. Instead you get an explanation of the existence of secondary markets in bonds and other investments to reconcile the needs and desires of different people 

If you allow side payments then the issue you identify goes away in a Coase sense. The citizens being polluted could pay for production to be reduced by one unit. This amount would have to be between the benefit of the reduced pollution and the loss to the pharmaceutical firm from the reduced production. But this last figure is small: at the competitive equilibrium the firm is matching its marginal revenue with its marginal cost so its profit from the final unit of production is very small, while presumably the pollution effect is larger (if not then the competitive equilibrium is already efficient). So the position with the side payment dominates the position without it in a Pareto sense, as both the citizens and the pharmaceutical firm are better off. Possibly further side payments and production reductions would be even more efficient, at least until the marginal profit loss exceeds the value of reduced pollution; that point is then Pareto optimal and the starting point was not. You may have to extend this slightly as the reduction in production also affects the customers of the pharmaceutical firm, who see a reduction in consumer surplus from the lower production. But again, side payments from the citizens to the customers can move to a Pareto optimal position, until the marginal value of the reduced pollution equals the combined marginal losses of the pharmaceutical firm and its customers. Advocates of the "polluter pays principle" would describe this as unfair, but Pareto optimality does not judge fairness. Another practical issue would be creating a mechanism which avoids free-riding and leads to an efficient agreement, a frequent issue with Coasian bargaining. 

Most Exchange Traded Funds of stocks or bonds have an associated income (even those which reinvest or accumulate this income) For example Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF has a dividend yield of $1.81\%$. So multiplying by $\$10,000,000,000$, this would give an annual income of about $\$18,100,000$, a little above income poverty levels On the other hand, people with a large amount of physical cash or gold coins and no income, and using some of this for living expenses, would count as being in income poverty, no matter how high their wealth. But there are relatively few people like this 

That Quarterly GDP chart looks as if it is already the percentage change in real GDP (for example put "Time" on "Annual" and note that the effects of the 1973 and 1979 oil price shocks are negative rather than positive) 

and there are similar laws in other places. There were two bases for this prohibition and regulation: 

Wikipedia has an article worth reading. An American trust was typically a combination of companies operating effectively as an entity with dominant market power, so perhaps somewhere between a cartel and a monopoly. Trusts originally took their names from the use of trust law to establish them, but later the term was used for all large companies and groups of companies which used their market position to take advantage of their suppliers and customers and to drive competitors out of business. The most famous was Standard Oil. This meant that when the US legislated to regulate or dismantle trusts, it call this antitrust law, where in Europe it would be called competition law. 

(As requested in comments) Primary dealers have a privileged position, so there is value in being registered as a primary dealer. The Treasury or Central Bank can impose standards of behaviour (e.g. an expectation of reasonable participation in all bond auctions or open market operations) as a condition of maintaining that registration. There are rules such as $URL$ and you will find sections such as 

No, there is no such evidence, because Russia does export gold, though it also adds to its reserves For example Sputnik News (established by the Russian government-controlled news agency Rossiya Segodnya) reported 

I have not seen the page, but it is likely to either be the price change or part of the price of a $10$ year benchmark US Treasury bond (probably with a par value of $\$100$ and possibly with an nominal yield of $2.75\%$) So either the price of this benchmark bond changed by $\$21/32= \$0.65625$ or the price was $\$98\; 21/32=\$98.65625$ Why US markets use eighths or sixteenths or thirty-seconds of a dollar when they have perfectly usable tenths and twentieths and hundredths (i.e. dimes, nickels and cents) to price bonds is another question. 

The rest of the paper speculated that this sort of process could lead to a smoother transition to a current account balance than one might otherwise naively think, especially if accompanied by currency depreciation. It combined this with some mathification and a toy numerical illustration 

Foreign produced goods will see price increases directly as a result of the tariff, which adds to the prices of these goods. The full tariff may not be passed through, as these higher prices will reduce demand, changing the supply/demand balance Domestically produced goods will usually see price increases indirectly as a result of the tariff, as demand for these domestically produced goods will increase as a result of the weaker competition from foreign produced goods, assuming an upward sloping supply curve Your quotes translate these likely price effects from tariffs into "inflation pressure" 

I would have thought that you could work out the amounts paid, and then compare the differences So for Dealer A, I would have thought the payments were $\$2000$ immediately followed by $36$ equal monthly payments of around $\$591.122$, though it does depend on how you translate $10\%$ into a monthly interest payment Similarly for Dealer B, I would have thought the payments were $\$4000$ immediately followed by $36$ equal monthly payments of around $\$522.275$, with the same caveat So the difference between them is $\$2000$ less paid to Dealer A immediately than to Dealer B, but offset by about $\$68.847$ paid more each month for $36$ months. I make those equal at a monthly discount rate of about $0.92677\%$ which compounds up to an annual discount rate of about $11.706\%$ 

As requested in comments: German banks lost a lot of money in the US sub-prime crisis and would have lost a lot more in Greece if the Eurosystem had not saved them. This is what might reasonably be expected if you run persistent trade surpluses: you gain foreign assets which may never be repaid or may be less valuable than you expected The European Commission is supposed to investigate under its Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure when a country's current account surplus exceeds 6% of GDP, and Germany's is now about 8%. In the end the Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure might in theory become an Excessive Imbalance Procedure and potentially sanctions for euro-area member states of up to 0.1% of GDP. But it will not happen to Germany, for European political reasons. Wikipedia has a description and you can also read the latest Commission report In effect Germany is making stuff and sending it to foreigners without exchanging it for a similar value of imports. Eventually people in Germany might notice that they could have a higher standard of living which their mercantilist politicians and economists have been denying them German savers and politicians are already protesting about low interest rates and perhaps one day might think that in a period of negative interest rates it could be sensible to consume (and import) more
