Negatory! First, having DOMS isn't a definite indication that you're having progress. It's simply your body's reaction to the previous work done. Any soreness felt should be gone in minutes or hours. If you perform your exercise with medium to high intensity, you should feel the effects. One of the effects I feel is the constriction in the muscles after the exercises. My mid-region will usually feel an inward push by the muscles. Another effect is (and this usually happens if you have a low body fat %) that the muscles should actually looked more engorged than usual. 

For specific exercises, I will recommend Yoga. These won't magically cure your anxiety; however, they allow your brain to relax and calm down. Also, people have different activities that take their minds off their troubles and calm them down. Some run; others walk. Some sleep, others knit. Through trial and error, you should find an activity that works for you. Once found, keep it in your bag of tricks. :)

Himanshu, First, congratulations on taking your health and fitness seriously. Taking the time to exercise is a big deal and I hope you make it a long term goal. Many experts recommend morning exercises as the best, especially before breakfast. Personally though, I don't believe that the time of the day matters. What matters is the consistency and intensity. 1000 calories burned during the day is the same as 1000 calories burned at night. If night workout fits with your schedule and you're consistent with it, you'll see optimal results. If day workout's your thing, you'll see identical results too. I haven't read any article about the body's ability to lose calories based on the time of the day. However, a lot of people exercise in the evenings because it's much comfortable for them to do so. They are more relaxed, have more time, or have difficulty exercising in the mornings. So, as long as you're consistent in your workout routines and maintain a good nutrition, you should be healthy and strong. Equally important, don't make your workout time the only time you exercise. Try to incorporate exercising into your daily routine. A quick 10-rep squats after sitting in a chair for a while can give your body a quick calorie burn (in less than 20 seconds). So is a quick 10-rep push up. 

Second, core training can be done daily. Your core muscles are strong enough to recover quickly from applied stress. Unlike legs or arms exercises (which can be extremely sore after intense exercises), the core muscles easily adapt to the stress have you seen anyone work their core muscles so hard they can't move the next day? Since it becomes tiring after a while (the exercises, not the muscles) if worked intensely daily, you can 

About the consequences of not eating them, (assuming you aren't obtaining the same nutrients from other sources), you'll be deficient in those nutrients as well. 

Only Update To This Answer I haven't touched my original answer, which is everything above this update. I've received some flak from some users because they believe I was wrong to suggest that the program is unlikely to progress long-term. I've tried explaining my reasoning to them, but they wouldn't hear none of it. So, I'm updating this answer with a challenge (mainly for scientific curiosity) for the practical minds: For 2 whole months, perform the accepted answer (given by Doc), 30 seconds every work hour (8 times for an 8-hr shift, 4 times for a 4-hr shift, etc.). If possible, measure the calories burned during the exercises. At the end of the period, reflect on how many times you missed the sessions (if any) and the reasons. Then perform my answer (or a related routine that consists of High Intensity exercises for about 20 minutes once a day at work) for 2 months. Again, if possible, measure the calories burned. At the end of the period, reflect on the sessions and determine how many sessions missed, total calories burned, etc. Based on the comparison of the two routines, answer the following answers: Which routine are you likely to stick with? Why was the unchosen routine not chosen? Based on your work schedule and location, which of the routines allow you the flexibility to be in shape without sacrificing work productivity? If possible, can you share your experiences with both routines? 

Performing a triathlon (running, biking, and swimming) requires skill, endurance, and lots of energy. Hopefully, you've honed your skill and endurance with your training. However, to actually complete your race, you need lots of energy. That's carbohydrate and fat. Forget about the caloric intake for that day; you should burn everything during the race. Your EPOC should burn the rest. First, you want to ensure that your breakfast is something your stomach is used to. The last thing you want to focus on is your tummy disagreeing with you (or cramping). Second, as I mentioned in the comments, you need lots of carbohydrate. Carbohydrates will provide you the energy you need. At the same time, you don't want to eat too heavy (remember you'll be swimming too). You have a few days before the race; experiment with portions to determine the optimal portion you'll need. Third, ditch the hot tea. Your body's going to be hot during the race; there's no reason for a hot tea. Some people might take coffee (caffeine for the alertness); others take orange juice or blend some juice. Take anything that's keep you hydrated without filling you up. Fourth, race day isn't one for a fruit salad; rather blend the fruits into a juice for the nutrients. Fifth, increase the number of slices if you need to eat bread. But I would rather ditch those for something else with more carbs and fat. Depending on your location, this shouldn't be hard. Again, ensure that the food will sit well with your tummy and the portion isn't too much. Sixth, get energy bars and banana handy. The banana is for the start of the race; the energy bars are for when you feel your energy depleting (although I'm not completely sure how you'll hold onto them during the race). Seventh, stay hydrated. That doesn't need any explanation :). Eating 3 or 4 hours before the race isn't bad; again, ensure this agrees with your tummy. Don't eat too close to the race (except the banana). You'll do fine. Let us know how it went. 

All these (and more) require no equipment and are very effective in keeping you fit (and trimming your belly fat). You can also obtain workout videos to help you. If you do, I recommend trying out P90X's Ab Ripper X video; it's awesome! Third, clean up your lifestyle. 

Absolutely yes! One, it constantly elevates your heart rate, burning more calories. Two, the pushups work your entire body (increasing the reps over time will be ideal as it allows your body to get stronger). Three, do that everyday and people will start thinking you're on steroids because of the consistent energy level you'll develop. Four, as long as you're not pushing your body to the max every time, you shouldn't feel any (much) fatigue. Five, this will allow you to incorporate the exercises in your regular workout sessions and train your body to want to workout constantly. Awesome! Go for it. Mind your nutrition as doing that doesn't give you the license to have a bad diet. Also, don't make them substitutes for your regular workout sessions. Now, drop down and give me 10 push-ups :). 

Reduce your training from 6 days to 3 - 4 days. Most effective weight loss programs recommend 3 days for exercises; this allows the body to rest and recuperate, which results in muscle building, metabolism increase, and fat loss. Sometimes, less is more. 

Gideon, As mentioned in the comments above, the Bizzy Diet isn't really a diet program; it's a quick fitness program (unlike Insanity or P90X); the main difference is that it guarantees result in 21 days. Nutrition While cooking is recommended (because it's cheaper and you have more control), you are free to purchase cooked meals. Even some fast food restaurants are offering health-conscious meals now. There are low-calorie chicken wraps from Chick Fila (about 250 calories, I believe) and some healthy burgers from Wendys (about 400 calories). You can also purchase home-style meals from other restaurants as well as visit health-conscious restaurants for their options. The biggest problem you'll have with these pre-cooked options is the quantity of sodium. Most of them are high in salt, so you have to watch out for them. Your current food choices consist of only vegetables and fruits; you need lots of protein too. So basically, your food choices should consist of at least protein and fiber. Eggs, cereal, milk, turkey, chicken, etc are options you can look into. But yes, you can modify the food to match what is currently available to you. Exercises Most of the exercises in Workout A are exercises you can do in your living room; you don't need a gym to accomplish them. Since you already have dumbbells, you can use them instead of barbells. If you happen to have a pullup bar (which you can get at Walmart for about $30 or less), you can perform all the remaining presses. Just ensure you workout on a mat, carpet or something soft so you don't apply too much pressure to your joints. You don't need a pool for the cardio (although you can use it too); run. You can run around the neighborhood, up and down stairs, or just in a single room. No treadmill is needed. Workout B mainly uses your body weight and some light dumbbells, which you already have. You can do those as well without additional equipment. If you're afraid of the intensity, go at your own pace and take breaks. Unless you have health issues that might prevent you from performing the program, you have everything (and can get the rest) to perform the exercises almost as recommended. In the end, your goal is to lose the weight, not complete some program. And adjusting programs into something that fits your schedule and capacity will help you much more than following it strictly. The only option you don't have is not working out. Now, go burn some goo :). 

If you can get your hand on P90X Yoga, give it a try; it's an hour and half though. It has all the yoga moves you've seen in other programs, and the movements are slow and steady. The instructor also shows you modified versions of the moves, just in case you are not strong enough to perform the hard ones. It also has some extra exercises, specifically designed for the core/abs, as well as stretch exercises. The only downside is the duration; it's too long (an hour and half); but you can always forward it to the specific exercises you want or perform it on the days you have ample time. The video really helps with your flexibility. 

Depending on how much you're planning on losing and the intensity of the exercises, you might not achieve your goal before your wedding day; however, that shouldn't stop you from exercising. Some people use exercises as a stress reliever; when they run, lift weights, do yoga, etc, the whole world (including their stress) disappears from their minds. They obtain relief using these activities. Others basically take walks to clear their minds. So, exercising can help you in these areas. You can start exercising almost anytime as long as you aren't having unrealistic expectations (such as losing 20 lbs in 40 days). Just start small and improve on it. More importantly, try to have fun with it; you'll lose weight easier this way :). Now, go burn some goo :). 

First, congratulations for taking the time to exercise. It's an achievement by itself (considering many people want to, but don't end up doing it). Second, If you really want to follow the StrongLifts 5X5 program, no, you cannot use dumbbells. You need to use a barbell and weights. Why? For one, you cannot squat with dumbbells. The core of the program is progressively increasing your lifting weights by adding 2.5 lbs at every workout. You cannot do that with dumbbells. For two, have you tried squatting (or bench pressing) with two 50-lbs dumbbells before? Have you tried the barbell equivalent? Which is harder? Yes, the dumbbells are much harder to do. So, it'll be impossible for you to follow the program with dumbbells. Third, depending on your starting weight, you might not need a spotter initially. You're recommended to start with the empty barbell. Because you're increasing the weights in small increments, it's relatively hard to really injure yourself, unless you aren't paying attention to your body. Fourth, as the weights you lift increase, the chance of injuring yourself increases as well. This is the time to worry about a spotter or a rack. You have a few options. 

Do you take multi-vitamins? If not, you need to add multi-vitamins to your daily intake. Vitamin C is especially needed for immune system boost. 

Before addressing your workout regimen, I will talk about your diet. You must take your diet seriously or you'll be wasting your time at the gym. Your calorie intake needs to be controlled. Cooking your own food is encouraged because it allows you to control what goes in it and the quantity; however, it's not a requirement.
