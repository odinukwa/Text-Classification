and the later poetry of Baudelaire; it's also used as a symbol by Persian poets such as Omar Khayyam. 

Martin Heidegger faced Ernst Cassirer in a famous disputation at Davos, Switzerland in the spring of 1929, which had such a dramatic effect on continental philosophy that the young Emmanuel Levinas, who attended the debate, felt as if he were: 

Godels incompleteness theorems has a long and complicated proof which can be made substantially simpler by making use of a modal logic, where the modality operator is interpreted as provability; this is an application in mathematics and logic. 

So from this perspective it's about discovering the first principles of things; sometimes it's called first philosophy for that reason; this is why he discusses in this text the following: 

Sure; which is why its allowed - alcohol for example is a 'drug'; but its socially proscribed too; one normally doesn't drink at work. This tallies with: 'If everyone was high all the time' society wouldn't function. 

Marcus Aurelius, well-known for his Meditations, in the second century AD, was a Stoic philosopher and also emperor of the Roman empire. Plato, in his Republic, advised that the ideal rulers of his ideal city-state (polis) which he named Kalliopolis, would be philosopher-kings. Was he the first pilosopher-king of Rome? Did his career, and his rule bear out Platos recommendation? 

This is a paradoxical statement. And one - well, at least I - tried to make sense of it. After all, most sentences one meets have a sense to them. And to understand is to understand the sense. And this is a habit hard to lose. Though, it sometimes seems, a habit worth losing. It's possible though, for some-one educated in the art of sentences and philosophy to so construct a sentence that no sense can be made of it. And it seems that this is such a sentence. It's root appears to be a certain sentence from Aristotle where he defines force. To paraphrase and to put in short: 

Sartre wrote 'we are condemned to be free', therefore affirming our will; this I don't think means a man condemned to live in solitary confinement by a court of law has choice on any meaningful way, but that his will is frustrated, brick'd up, block'd. But his will still remains, in potentia; like the air in his cell which acts pressurefully against the walls of cell - though we don't notice it; and were the walls to fall, the air would rush out and escape. Or one could endow, this prisoner, as did Dumas in The Count of Monte Cristo, a kind of supernatural endurance, persistence and canniness that allowed his prisoner to escape ... 

Parmenides is told by the unknown goddess that he meets, after being let through the gates of night and day by Dike (Justice); not that the 'purpose' of enquiry is to determine the existence of things, but that: 

Mobius strips, are generally held to have only one side - if one marks a place on the strip and on what looks like the other side then a pencil can draw a line between these two points without ever leaving the surface of the strip. Technically this property is called non-orientability; and what we've done in the above demonstration is show that both 'sides' are path-connected. So our intuition is shown to be limited and a little foolish. However, one can as why then does it look as though it has two sides; a little thought shows that it is because we examine locally; in the same way that the earth looks flat, but in fact is round, and we resolve this tension by saying that the earth is locally flat; similarly we can say that the mobius strip is locally two-sided but not so globally. (Now if the default adjective applied to the concept is local rather than global we could just simply say that the mobius strip is two-sided). So, can we say that the Mobius strip has a front and back, despite all the write-ups it has had, by adding 'locally' as a qualifier? 

Yes, but not straight-forwardly; it's a spark that might strike - or not. To take a simpler example, consider music: two persons may listen to the same piece of music, and it is then right to say they have heard the same sounds; but one might have felt or been transported in a deeper way than the other, who heard merely the play of sound. This, in fact is one of the functions of sacred art; traditionally oral poetry or music; but it requires receptivity, and for that - rare and temperamental; which is one reason it's surrounded by rituals of association and evocation - a kind of sympathetic magic. There's an echo of this in the last paragraph of Joyce's A Portrait of an Artist where the young Stephen Dedalus on the cusp of manhood has an epiphany, or rather Joyce is communicating his: 

I read that article years ago; the main problem as I see here, is the problem of 'false consciousness', the mendacity of propaganda, as well as the economic problem, for example student debt, housing - all of which means mortgaging ones future merely to stay afloat in an inimical social, political and economic situation; if a man or a woman has to struggle merely to live, to survive, then it is not suprising that their higher hopes and dreams are suffocated, and then bequeathed to a generation behind them. The problem then is not to attack the symptoms of the situation but it's root causes so that human flourishing can actually flourish instead of being just faked. 

Now compare this to Badious 'Event - something that disrupts the current situation'. In the wikipedia entry to Badiou, they write that Badiou tries 

But this isn't true of topoi in its geometric incarnation an extensive, sophisticated & forbidding theory has been built by Grothendieck & his co-workers in Algebraic Geometry. Philosophically this is leading to the idea of a 'multiverse' of set theories in which ZFC is a distinguished one. A theory is interpreted in a topos. Compare this with model theory where one interprets a theory in a model which has set semantics. All this so far is category theory done in dimension 1. In higher dimensions other features appear. In infinite dimensions homology & cohomology have a natural context within which hundreds of such theories are specialised versions. Now when one looks at an infinite topos its internal logic is homotopy type theory which has been identified as per-lofs intuitionistic type theory. A concerted effort is under way led by Voedvodsky & Awodey to understand this in a foundational manner. I think one needs to get away from the idea that not having correct foundations means that all of mathematics suffers. Obviously Newton for example was able to reason with calculus even though his theory wasn't foundationally established, similarly with Euclids plane geometry. In a sense different areas of mathematics have their own ontology, their own way of making meaning. Hilberts programme was a reductionist one which aimed at a very pure single ontological level. Historically mathematics has had a symbiotic relationship with physics - ideas of algebra & calculus have mutually impacted both. But, consider that set theory despite its foundational aspect has had no contact with Physics. This, despite appearances, argues against taking set theory as foundational. This also goes for set theory's relationship with other areas of mathematics inside mathematics proper. Category theory has impacted physics, for example the idea of a TQFT is most elegantly formulated as a functor from the category of n-corbordisms. Another example is higher gauge theory which is a generalisation of ordinary gauge theory, important precisly because it is the language within which the Yang-Mills Theories & EM are written, and with a little cunning Gravity. Perhaps as a coda its worth enunciating a couple of ideas in Category theory which I find philosophically interesting. One can think of it as a loosening or expansion of Liebnizs prinicple of indiscernibles. If two objects have all the same properties they must be identical. The first is what is known as universal properties. This is a little badly named, they're better thought of as characteristic properties. Instead of asking specifically for an object one specifies what properties it must satisfy to characterise the object uniquely. This means that any such object is actually not unique - it is unique upto isomorphism. In categorical thinking this is the best that one can do. One can think of this as an loosening - here they're not, they're isomorphic. This means for example the number one is not unique, there are many of them but they are all isomorphic to one another. But in fact there is more, if two objects are not the same, but isomorphic, they may be isomorphic in more than one way - one can then compare these two isomorphisms, and so on. This leads to an infinite progression. In infinite-dimensional category theory this very expanded idea of equality is the one used.
