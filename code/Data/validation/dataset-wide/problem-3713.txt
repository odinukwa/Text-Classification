This would be because when your training outdoors or in gym, your heart rate is faster due to your body temperature being so raised, where as when you swim the water keeps your body temp regulated. It is neither good nor bad, it is just what happens. Swimming is an extremely good and beneficial exercise. 

If you have a whole week to strength train and really wanna push yourself. Train a different muscle every day of the week. such as: Monday: back and biceps, shoulders Tuesday: legs and abs Wednesday: chest, tris Thursday: break then repreat and break again on sunday, do 30 minutes of cardio before and after. make sure while your doing these to real push your limits, if you normally only do about 3 sets for one muscle.. do 5 exercises, 3 sets each. 

I have no idea how many calories im meant to be eating a day to lose weight... Some calculators tell me my maintence is 1400, some 1600 and some even 2200! I am female, 141 pounds (63kg), 168cm tall, 19 years old. Have only been lifting for 2-3 months so prob have about 5kg muscle built. (if that's help you determine my body composition) Goal: lose weight, gain muscle Regimine: cardio and weight lift, about 4 times a week, but have been slacking off since cutting as I worry I will just eat away at my muscle by working them out so hard and not feeding them enough? Diet: mainly bread, protein shakes, tuna, yogurt, weight watcher lasagnes, etc. Sometimes smoothies in morn. About 1500 cal. I get enough protein and sleep Could anyone tell me my maintence for training days and non training days? Like non training would it be about 1300? and training days 1600? does that sound right? 

it has protein, carbs, and vegetables and nutritiance! not gaining minimal fat whilst gaining muscle is impossible... don't stress :) per pound of muscle you gain your body burns an extra 80 cal per day... so don't stress about weight just keep lifting and eating big and the weight will sort it self out :) if not go on a cutting phase in a few weeks, 

I began tranining split training 3 months ago, about 4 days a week. I am normally SO SORE after every workout and have been making gains in strength and size. I took about 2 weeks off from the gym and ever since getting back into it... I do not get sore? And I am doing basically the quantity and duration as what ive always done. about 4 exercises with 3 sets per exercise about 10 reps. Yesterday I did a killer ab workout, so many different exercises and even an ab circuit, and trained shoulders pretty hard (which I don't train that often) and feel nothing today? same has been happening lately when I train abs and such? My ab workout is quite lengthy and do incorporate increasing weight to my ab workout.... Am I just getting used to it or do I need to switch up my workout? 

Basically if you are gaining size and not mass that means you are either lacking calories or protein, or not doing a workout strong enough to produce the micro tears and re build. The token amount of protein to have in building muscle is 1g per pound of body weight. I weight 145 pounds, so to build muscle I have to aim for 145. It is very hard to reach this hence many people who train don't grow as much as they would like. Eg cup of milk has 8g, tuna is 18g etc. That is good that you are taking the protein straight after training as after you lift weights there is a 20 monute "window" as they call it where the body acts as sponge and needs protein ASAP. hence a protein shake with about 30g after training is good. Use whey protein for this. Now you know protein lets cover calories. If you are quite a skinny guy it will be VERY hard for you to calculate how many calories you eat and I doubt you want to anyway... Basically unless you have a far bit of body fat.. if you want to gain muscle you have to eat! eat every 3-4 hours with protein based meals. If you want to look at your calorie daily need though for boys is about 2000-3000 and girls about 1500-2200. you can put your name and age and everything into calculations in google and it will figure it out for you. and with the lifting do it so on your 8th or 9th rep you COULD NOT do another rep for your life, feel the burn! and make sure you keep up with your water in take :) hope I could help! If you already are lifting as hard as you can and going up weights every few weeks then your doing fine. when I am not strong enough to go up weights but want a killer workout. I will do this: (say its for biceps- eg bicep curl).. start at absoulute max weight (for me is 7kg- im a girl) I do 5 of them, or even 3 (whatever I can do) then without a break pick up a 5kg weight, do 10 reps then pick up a 3kg weight and do 15 reps. hence the musxcle is under tension a LONG time, and you have varied the rep/weighjt range for muscle confusion and lifted heavier than usual! its called super sets really good for muscle 

This depends on a couple of factors such as how tall your desk is and at what hight will you be able to have proper wrist position. When I purchased an exercise ball for this purpose, I would go to the store and get the biggest one they had (I'm 6'3"). This usually ended up being 30 inches (75cm) in diameter. I would suggest you do the same thing and get the biggest one they have for sale. If it ends up being too big, you can always deflate it to make it the right height. Just a personal note: Keep the pump handy that comes with the exercise ball. I usually had to re inflate it once every couple months. Also keep any cats with claws away or you'll end up with a sore tail bone when your exercise suddenly deflates. 

I don't think there's anything wrong with doing mini workouts throughout the day, especially if you wouldn't do them otherwise. Unless you're specifically trying to improve your pushups and chinups, you may want to include some other simple body weight exercises as well. Some I could think of off the top of my head: 

A pound of muscle burns more calories at rest than a pound of fat. This fact alone should tell you that weight lifting is a two-edged sword: not only do you burn calories while you're performing the exercises, but you're also increasing your muscle mass which will burn more calories at rest. Yes, you need to add exercises to your workout. You need to lift weights (even if it's just your body weight), challenge your body, and force it to improve. You can start out with standing lunges, pushups, pullups, and crunches. If you can't do those, there are ways to cheat the exercise to make it easier. Once that's no longer a challenge pick up a sledge hammer and swing it at a tire or toss a bag of sand around. Most importantly, switch it up so your body doesn't get use to one set routine. 

While it looks like a very good overall workout, my one criticism is the lack of leg exercises on your leg day. At the very least you could do some calf work: I would also throw in some abduction and adduction work, but that might be difficult with your limited equipment. Do you ever do any abdominal work? You have some nice full body exercises, but it couldn't hurt to do some crunches once in a while. The only other thing I would suggest is mixing it up. It seems like you've found a workout routine and you're going to stick with it for a while. This is something I don't agree with. You should always be challenging your muscles by doing new exercises. I try to never do the same exercise in the same way ever! Don't underestimate the usefulness of body weight exercises (lunges, squats, leg lifts, push ups, etc). You could even get outside and toss some sandbags around for a good workout. 

Success! Notice that my exercise "routine" has more to do with what I eat and how much I sleep to let my body recover than it does with how many reps I do and what exercises I perform. Getting 6-pack abs requires 90% dedication to a healthy diet and lifestyle and 10% use of the correct exercises. Get up off the floor and stop doing those crunches. Now get yourself into the kitchen and make yourself an egg white omelet. 

It gives you a basis for comparing yourself to yourself. If you could only do 10 pushups for years, then tried a new exercise and all the sudden you can do 50 pushups, you might want to example that and see why there was a change. For weight lifting, you don't want to do too many reps. For example, don't more than 20 leg extensions means you're probably not moving enough weight. You need to balance out your weight and reps to keep them within certain ranges. Besides, without counting how will you ever be able to brag to your buddies? 

Cramps would be a dead giveaway especially while riding a bike. Some other signs to look for are confusion, dizziness, tiredness, irritability, and a swollen tongue. None of these are necessary or sufficient to diagnose someone as dehydrated however. You'll need to play it by ear. A more serious condition that you should certainly be on the look out is heat stroke. This will develop quite quickly in individuals that are dehydrated, out in the head, and exercising. Symptoms of heat stroke are the same as I listed above, but most easily identified by a lack of sweat. Once somebody has developed heat stroke they are no longer able to cool their body and require immediate attention (cold water, shade, fan, etc). 

You can also add in core muscles on any or all of those days. Alternately, you can do a full body work out. A workout of this type will involve exercises that engage most of the muscles in your body: 

Are you taking a typical dose of multi vitamins? If so then keep it up. Thousands if not millions of people are taking a multi without exercising regularly. Taking a multi will help you stay healthier overall which will help you recover faster. For no other reason than your body doesn't have to work as hard to fight off illness. I don't quite understand the train of thought between: you changed your diet, you started feeling weak, you took a multi vitamin. It seems to me that the change in diet is what's having the adverse effects on you and that is where you need to fix in order to feel less weak.
