The Nike Hyperfeel Shoes are intended to offer a light, barefoot feel. However, if they are causing blisters for the user then it would be advised to use a low no-show sock with them to prevent the blisters. 

Many of my friends use a pre workout such as C4 prior to lifting. I have never used one but am curious if I would see a major change in the effectiveness of my workout. I do a lot of strength training and weight lifting for my hour long workouts. Will using pre-workout help at all besides giving me more energy? 

I felt the same way when I started to drink protein. I wasn't sure if it was safe or effective to use these supplements. I actually consulted my doctor regarding them and she said that used in moderation there is no health risk for them unless you are allergic to the ingredients. That was about a year and a half ago, and now every time I finish a workout I will drink a single shake with usually 60 grams of protein in it. Very often whey protein is used to help build lean muscle or mass. If you are really concerned about using these products, there are all natural protein mixes out there that can be combined with fruit or vegetables to make shakes with the same amount of protein. Blender Bottle has a whole list of different shakes that all for whey protein with natural things such as yogurt or fruit: $URL$ 

do i need to follow above ? I am a beginner & also is above statement depends on Intensity level ? currently i am working in LOW intensity ? 

From last 6 months , Due to very good diet & little bit cardio, i reduced my weight & fat [belly] , now i started to workout in Gym from few days for strength training & started to eat both carbs and proteins more than before.... seems like instead of muscles, again i am getting belly fat , how to get muscles without getting any little but fat ? What wrong i am doing here ? 

I started to workout in gym Age : 27, Male Height : 6.1 [184 ] Weight : 68 kgs [ 150 pound] [ Lightly active (moderate exercise but sedentary job)] usually i eat 50gms/110 pounds of protein per day , According to this link , if i want muscle gain, i need 179 Gm/393 pound protein , OMG is that much protein really required ? 

I workout on Monday - thursday & dont take required amount of protein to build muscles due to some reasons.... i can able to take enough protein from friday to sunday.... so if i need 150g protein per day to gain muscle, if i take **50 g protein per day from monday to thursday & if i take 150 g protein per day from friday to sunday , will that helpfull to build muscles ? 

A warm up is often dependent on the sport. For instance, before I play soccer,i specifically warm up my legs because I know I will be using them the most. I wouldn't warm up my arms. As you stated, warming up is getting the blood flowing, and this is exactly right. Your muscles do not receive as much blood flow when they are not in extreme use, so doing some light exercises such as jogging or lunges would help to "prime" your muscles. This light activity raises the athletes pulse, which pumps more blood to the target area and helps it to sustain physical activity for longer. When you perform physical activity, your cells require more oxygen to keep going, and this is why you warm up. It prepares your system for the intense activity you are about to perform. 

Alright so what I use when I do parkour or free running are adidas classic samba shoes. They are very soft and after some wearing form to your foot in a good manner. I really like them as they have enough support for my arch yet enough grip for vaults and other moves. I have had 2 pairs and neither have ever ripped, i just out grew them. I would highly recommend them for parkour if you like this type of shoe. 

Mr.A & Mr.B, Mr.C all three workout in same level & eat same amount of protein & Carbs.... Mr.A sleeps for 9 hours.... Mr.B sleeps for 8 hours.... Mr.C sleeps for 7 hours.... Is Mr. A build the muscle early [ or more ] than Mr.C ? How much sleep really matters for muscle gain?.... In our Gym , some seniors tell they sleep only 6 hours due to lack of time, still they have good muscles!.... 

which is better option in below to reduce body fat 1)morning - 80 % protein , afternoon - 80 % carbohydrates , evening - handfull of nuts & eating only fruits at dinner. 2)taking carbs, proteins , fats & fruits for breakfast, lunch, dinner ? 

i am working out in gym from last 3 months.... [ 4 days week , 30 minutes per day ] I want muscle , shape & want to be fit.... I did't saw any major improvements as i did't workout out intensively & did't took enough protein. [ maximum i was taking 50 g protein from food per day [ no other protein supplements ] , but i need atleast 120 g protein per day for my body weight.] also due to some reason i cant able to take more than 50 gm protein per day for next one month. after one month i can take up to more than 120 g protein per day. So is it better to go and workout in gym for next one month or is it better to skip gym for next one month , is there any advantage in going to gym for next month ? 

I am in the same situation actually as a high school student. I wake up at 4:30 in the morning sometimes to get to school and don't get home until 6 just to start my homework. I certainly find that eating healthier is a must. I know it is easy to succumb to the temptation of a bag of chips or a soda on the way home from school just to get some food into you, but grab an apple or a banana instead. If workouts are not going to be possible, then watch what you eat. Even for half an hour find a way to run or bike for a little while. Not only does it help with your physical fitness, it also helps you mentally and keeps you focused and relieves stress. THe gym I usually go to is open late so I will usually study from 7:00-9:00 then go to the gym until 10, returning home to study for another hour. If a gym isn't an option or you just don't have time, there are plenty of at home workouts you can do before or after school to take a break from the books. This is one of my personal favorite at home workouts: $URL$ 

Currently I am working on Chest & biceps [ Mon ] , Triceps [ Tue ] , Back [ Wed] , Shoulders [ Thu ], Legs [ Fri ] from Mon to friday.... Somewhere i read below : 

I am skinny fat , physically bit weak boy [ 26 age ] with 6.1 tall [ 1.83 ] and reduced my body weight from 78 kg [ 171 pounds] to 71 kgs [156 pounds] . still i have some belly and i wanted to eliminate that completely. along with that i want to get some shape and muscle. right now i am doing cardio 60 - 90 minutes per week and i am in calorie deficit diet. what i want to know is "I want to do strength training also" along with cardio. So how much cardio and how much strength training is not too much for me ? may i go with 5 days [ 30 minutes/day ] strength training & 3 days [ 30 minutes/day ] cardio per week ? 

i am skinny fat & badly wanted to reduce belly fat. I am not such powerfull boy at the age of 26. maximum i can run half an hour in morning , so may i run half an hour in evening also , is that fine ? or is it better to take some rest in morning and run for half an hour again. 

17 year old athlete, 190lb 5'11" I want to really gain some definition and strength for my forearms but don't really know how to go about it. Any recommendations on good exercises to do or other methods? 

Usually this would be called an active rest day, and is something that I find very effective. I lift 6 days a week then do cardio whether it be riding my bike, jogging, running, or soccer drills. I find it quite helpful. It gives your muscles time to recover but you are still getting your daily dose of exercise. As you said, it is important to avoid using the muscles you just trained. This is why I often do my leg day first day of the week or mid week, so my cardio day is not back to back. 

I'm an 18 year old athlete, 210 lbs. I work out a lot, working on gaining strength and muscle. After a really intense workout I'll get stretch marks along some of the areas that I worked such as biceps. Is this normal? Should I be worried or are these common for anyone who does intense weight training? Thanks in advance.
