This question differs from the question What is the minimum human population necessary for a sustainable colony? because: 

I'm working on creating a species that favours small families for a number of reasons, and have no interest in 'breeding as much as possible'. As a consequence, their population size is small. But how small can a population be, without running (ever) into problems with genetic diversity? I'm interested in more than 'survivability'; the species' gene pool should not degenerate (some margin allowed). I'm looking for some well-founded answers or directions. Assume that genetics for this species works similar to that of humans, and that their gene pool is of good quality at the start. You can also assume that they choose partners wisely, but there is no designation of partners, so margin is necessary. They have good health care and low child mortality rates. Assume that at least 90% of the population reaches at least fertile age. Other 'rules': 

I want to add a few things. Your timeline covers a lot of history. I myself have only read in depth about WW2 and the Soviet side of the space race. 

I think you have a good timeline that, if you're really serious about maximum plausibility, just needs a little work. If you ever do publish or post it online, please come back and post a link so we can get it. As others have recommended, I will recommend too: don't get too bogged down in backstory. Stick with the action parts and enthralling parts first. First impressions are everything, and to quote the X-Files, however paranoid you are, you aren't paranoid enough. You can tell the backstory gradually over time with flashbacks, conversation, history lessons? If you haven't heard of Isaac Asimov, I highly recommend his short stories. He was a master of telling backstory through simple conversation between two characters. You can probably get anthologies of him on amazon for one penny (and 3.99 shipping! >:O ) 

You need at least half a moon cycle between the two events if they involve the same moon; lunar eclipse can only occur during the full moon and a solar eclipse only during a new moon. Unless of course your world has more than one moon. 

Hollywood is lying to you. GPS is a receive-only device like your car's FM radio. To track someone with GPS you need to send the coordinates from device to the guy tracking it somehow. That requires sending a signal to a receiver in range. Which can then forward it to the guy tracking it. "GPS trackers" in use today (to tracking a delivery truck fleet for example) use the cell phone network to text the location of the truck to the server. 

looking for reflections of sunlight IS radar. Just with receiver (your sensors) and transmitter (the sun) at different positions. Using a different transmitter would not gain much though looking beyond the visible spectrum would, just about every energy using object will emit black-body radiation. You can look for that. 

The creature I'm designing has a tail with spikes on the end of it. The material of the spikes should be strong/durable (not break easily), and very sharp (the edge as well as the sides, being able to cut through most materials like metal). The tail has several uses where these spikes might be a very real problem (like balancing, flexing around stuff to pick it up, and such). I'm looking for a way for the creature to protect itself and its surroundings from these spikes when they are not necessary. So far I've come up with: 

To be clear, they fly by flapping the wings / soaring on currents, as birds do.The dragons in this case are small (somewhat bigger than a big dog / size of a medium-sized pony). They do not weigh much to be able to fly (how much is still open for debate). Does such a material exist? Would it be plausible to appear naturally in a creature? What speed would a dragon as depicted be able to achieve with wings consisting of this material? 

I think I have a valid answer that will have a 60% or higher rate (it builds on the answer from chalsyfromUK): 

I would just add that, if we do this back in the early 1900's...it would probably kill them regardless of any medical conditions. Imagine showing The Blair Witch Project, or some other modern horror movie, to people from that era. I suspect even a lot of the younger folks would die, either of heart attack or psycho-stresses soon after. (Ironically, like you started in your OP, a lot of horror films have this theme where a person sees a video and they die from it, and a valid way to do that might be to show a horror movie too!) The propaganda approach is also equally valid here. People like Stalin took advantage of new technology like radio and movies, of which most people had never heard/seen before, to build huge cults of personality. So you could use a propaganda movie to make the people go to war or march to the south pole, whatever. So in your book, ask yourself what "culture" the general population has. Then ask yourself, what about other cultures? Future cultures? Will 100 years from now have movies that could make us die today? Alien cultures? They might be different enough in just the right way, that us today might suffer and die from watching one of their movies. 

You can fake a gas leak during the night using the oven/stove. Assuming there is no safety built-in to shut off the gas if it fails to ignite. Then when optimal mixture is achieved spark the igniter. Alternatively you can create a carbon monoxide buildup by closing the windows and starting the car in the garage and/or sealing the chimney stack and firing up the boiler then recirculating the gas through the AC system. 

Flapping wing designs are what came first in our history but they didn't work because too high gravity and too thin atmosphere for the weight of the craft. So in a world with thicker atmosphere and/or lighter gravity and perhaps lighter materials to build them out of, an ornithopter will work and be used until people discover the efficiency of the fixed wing+propeller. 

Would an ancient civilization be able to build a bicycle if they thought it up somehow? It doesn't have to be a modern bike with handbrakes and multiple gears and shock absorbers. It could be one gear and just pedal backwards to brake. As a concrete example, could the Ancient Romans have done this? Pretty sure they had gears but not sure about the chain sprocket. EDIT: apparently a chain is not strictly necessary since you could just attach pedals directly to one of the wheels. There is also a question of exactly what metal or alloy to use so that the frame is strong enough. Could wood also work? What would it take for ancient peoples to conceive of the idea? They had the wheel and gear, but where would the idea of "pedal power" come from? It's a shame it wasn't invented sooner. All those Roman roads were already built. 

I mentioned birds in my other answer so why not here as well, Using a gizzard centaurs would be able to digest fibrous foods that humans wouldn't be able to. Then allowing the food to be fermented in a rumen stomach would allow the remaining digestive system to get more out of the plant matter. (breaking down toxins as needed) Having dexterous hands would allow them to get to food that other animals would have a hard time getting behind spines or in burrs/cupules. 

Because there are natural canals already existing in many landscapes, namely rivers. So for example you would have a existing trade route that uses 2 river journeys. The next step would be to connect the 2 rivers with a canal to remove the cost of the offload, transport on land and reload on the other river. Also important is that canals are easier to maintain, roads get muddy and develop pot holes and ruts that impede travel. While water will always provide the same travel comfort until it freezes over.
