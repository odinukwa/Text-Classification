It helps to know what is going on underground when looking for geological patters. Hot springs are of course geothermally heated by pockets of magma in the crust that are relatively close to the surface. Understanding the underlaying strata and ground water patters are essential to accurately predicting where hydraulic phenomena will appear. At the very least you need a stratigraphic map so you can examine fault structures and determine where layers of porous rock intersect with faults, the surface, and also where aquatards may inhibit ground water flow. As others have already indicated here, the fact that the hot springs you are observing are in a line suggests that they are over a fault line, likely an area of tectonic uplift. If you were to examine the stratigraphy of the areas where the known hot springs are, you could identify which layers of strata the heated groundwater is permeating to the surface from, and then locate other areas along that line where those same layers intersect with the surface again. I'll confess that reading a stratiographic map isn't that easy, but if you can even get a vague idea of where you might suspect undiscovered springs will appear based on the geology and geography, it will greatly reduce your search area. Without conducting a geological survey with a team of geologists, the next best thing to do is to go bush whackin' away from the beaten trail, using the suggestions that @Sherwood gave you in their answer. An IR thermal imager would be handy to bring along with you, you can get relatively affordable ones that attach to your iPhone. It's no simple task to actually go out and find natural resources. Which is the number one reason why geologists are able to get jobs other than just teaching... Most of the time when people stumble onto hot-springs it's because they're looking for something else. Lots of springs are discovered by hunters and trappers this way. Good luck finding your personal secret hotspring, I'm sure you'll have fun exploring the untamed bush whether you find one or not.

Your other option is to demo some more gear, or pick something up second hand, I typically try a new sport out first on used cheap gear, then if I really like it, save up and invest in something good. We live in a day and age where there are lots of technologies that favour slightly different styles. So who knows, maybe you're a tele-groupie and just don't know it yet and telemark is the direction you want to go. There are still newer technologies coming out for telemarking, like the NTN binding system, and I hear they're developing hydraulic knee braces that allow telemarker's legs to last almost as long as AT skiers on the slopes (jokes, telemarkers will always burn their legs out way faster than ATers). 

So the answer appears to be: There are more routes to climb on El Cap, and the quality of climbing is better/more varied. 

What I'm wondering is if there's any risks to excavating these tunnels? I don't think that they would cave in, they held themselves up just fine before getting clogged up with scree, I'm more concerned about digging up into the scree. There's one cave that may have a blocked entrance on the other side of the mountain it's in, which could be easily excavated from the inside out, but I don't know how much scree might be behind where we want to dig. I'm worried about an avalanche of scree pouring into the cave once we clear out enough of the tunnel. How safe would it be to attempt to dig through some of these blocked passages? 

No, at least not if you're in a location where you're not at risk of dying from exposure to the elements, but considering most uninhabited island are in the South Pacific, I think exposure is less of a worry if you're ever caught in this situation. The determining factor is going to be the availability of fresh water (next to your abilities as a survivalist). The size of the island is irrelevant if you don't have a supply of water to drink, you'll quickly die of dehydration. You could be on a +4,000ft2 sandbar in the middle of the pacific with absolutely no water to drink, but even if water is not available on the island however, it could still potentially be collected as rain water, or distilled from seawater. As far as island size, as long as it is an island at both low tide and high tide, then you will be safe from drowning, then the ocean can provide you with whatever else you need to stay alive. You will have access to materials to make tools and a rudimentary shelter from the sun out of shells, coral, rocks and the bones of sea creatures, and you will have a steady supply of food from all the little fish, urchins and shellfish that thrive in the reefs around small islands. It wouldn't be easy, but you could stay alive for as long as the ocean provides. Granted, being on an island that merely spares you from death with no small measure of skill, work, and determination is hardly considered "supporting life". There's a difference between being alive and truly living. When I think of supporting life, I think of a location where life can thrive comfortably, grow and be happy, not merely surviving. 

Before you climb up onto the ledge place a solid piece of protection that will control the direction of pull, then set up a solid semi-hanging belay stance over in the crack. This will allow you to belay to the side of the climber, but it eliminates a swing if they take a fall. You could have even used that tree as your directional piece of protection, just throw a sling around it with a locking biner or a couple of quickdraws. As long as you test it out (give it a couple firm kicks/yanks) and it feels like it could hold, you could use it, just maybe not as your main anchor. Setting anchors is more of an art than a skill. A good trad climber needs to have excellent problem solving skills to be able to take advantage of everything at his disposal, I love going out with old veteran climbers just to watch them place anchors and set up belays, I always learn something new from them. It's amazing to watch decades of experience at work, if I were to use a corny analogy; I'd say it's like watching a master paint a perfect landscape. Whatever you end up doing, you'll eventually find something that suits you best. Just stick to the anchor building mantra and make sure every anchor is SRENE. 

The laces on my hiking boots broke years ago, and instead of going out of my way to buy a replacement pair, I replaced them with some lengths of paracord I had kicking around, albeit with the intent of eventually getting proper laces. I never got around to it, and the bright yellow and pink cords are still working great, giving no indication they're ever going to wear out. Now whenever I tie up my boots, I wonder what is it about boot laces or shoe laces that makes them so much more preferred than your average cord? 

As you can see from the image above the two styles of skiing both have their extremes but also share some middle ground. If you're just getting into it, and want to invest in new gear, I would seriously recommend going with an AT setup if the type of backcountry skiing you want to do is going to be mostly looking for an untouched slope to ski down, but if you're more interested in long tours, but want more control, then go with a beefier SNS setup like the one pictured second from the left above. I personally am partial to the SNS system over the NNN system, because they have a deeper heel grove that offers more heel control in my opinion, even more so with the SNS pilot. SNS (Salomon Nordic System) Binding: 

Images: Pinterest, of all places... These filters appear to only be effective at cleaning the water of dirt and debris, boiling the water is still recommended for purifying the water and killing anything that might make it through your filter, though any poisons should be mostly absorbed by the charcoal. What remains to be discovered is what could potentially be used in either of these systems to purify the water as much as possible without boiling. 

Another place you'll find mountains very similar to the the Scottish mountains is in Newfoundland Canada: Grand Codroy Valley 

Good Ice Sounds obvious, but that's the answer, you need to learn how to identify good solid ice for all your screw placements. The best ice is the thickest ice you can find, so you can place your longest screws; clear and blue will be the most solid, while the worst ice is cloudy or brown, full of bubbles (aerated) and 'crunches' when you poke it, or has water flowing through or under it. You can test ice by gently tapping it and listening to the sound, but don't hit it hard enough to weaken it. The temperature plays a huge part in the quality of ice as well; -10°C (±5°C) is the best temperature for ice climbing, warmer temperatures mean softer ice, and colder temperatures mean harder, more brittle ice. What features should you look for? Thick slabs of solid ice stuck to rock. Don't place ice screws on curtains or pillars, this can be to your detriment, if you're climbing some hanging ice that happens to cleave from the wall while you're still on it, then being bolted to that falling ice could kill you, It's best to wait until you climb up to where the ice is secured to the rock above to place your first screw. Be sure to use a screamer or reusable shock absorber for your first screw, as well as over any over-hangs, and angle your screws about 10° up into the ice, tests have shown that screws have better holding power when angled up a bit. Doesn't matter how good the ice is, you never want to take a fall while ice climbing, depending on who you ask, there's no such thing as good ice just varying degrees of bad ice. Rule number one when ice climbing: DON'T FALL. 

Hopefully the park has enough of an infrastructure to post bulletins by the time you go on your trip, if not, then it would be advisable to carry effective, approved polar bear deterrents and know how to use them. 

First of all don't scratch. blood sucking insects inject anti-coagulant under your skin to prevent your blood from clotting and forming a scab so they don't get their mouthes stuck inside you while sucking. If you scratch, you only manage to spread the anti-coagulant around under your skin, which intensifies the itch and makes things worse. Train your brain not to unconsciously scratch every itch, and they won't persist as long. The go-to medicinal plant for pretty much everything is yarrow (Achillea millefolium). It's as common as plants come in North America, but I checked and it's apparently also native to the UK. We were taught to use it as kids to remedy stinging nettles, but it also works for other types of stings and bites by drawing the toxins out of your skin. Simply pick the fern-like leaves, chew on them a bit to partially mash them into a paste, then apply to the affected area. Relief is almost instant. It also works well as a tea for relief of cold symptoms and fever, which doesn't surprise you after you've tasted it, since it tastes like a kinda minty but mostly sappy-bitter cough syrup. Whenever I use it on people suffering from a rash out the woods, I always get them to chew it up for me. 

Traveling solo doesn't necessarily make a hike any riskier, or lessen your chance of injury. What is does do, is increase the response time of rescue workers. When you're hiking in a group and something happens, then you have immediate help right there to address any critical needs; from putting pressure on a deadly bleed, to carrying your broken body back to civilization. Hiking with groups can also potentially prevent an incident by increasing the odds that someone could lend a hand to help you out of that raging river before it sweeps you over a waterfall, or grabbing you by the shoulder while you're off balance and saving you before you fall off a treacherous cliff. At the very least, while in a group, if you get hurt, there's at least one other person who can run and get you the help you need as soon as possible. When you're alone, you have to wait until someone notices you've been gone longer than you should have been before they send help, and by then it could be too late. There was just barely an incident near Portland Oregon this past month, where a girl went hiking without telling anyone, and no one noticed she was missing until her Mom happened to come up from out of state to visit and discovered her daughter's roommate was under the impression the daughter had gone home to visit her parents. After tracking down the most recent GPS info from her phone, they found her abandoned car at a trailhead in a popular hiking area. Weeks later, after a huge search effort–this girl was the daughter of a celebrity piano composer–which covered hundreds of miles of trail, search dogs were able to sniff out some human remains deep in a ravine where no one could have ever spotted them. They were positively identified as the young woman. Had she informed her roommate about her intensions, the search could have been initiated a lot sooner, rescue workers would have known which trail to search first, and had a much better chance of finding her before she perished. If you plan on hiking solo, first plan your route, and leave your plan with someone who you will contact when you get back. If you're going out for the weekend, you could let someone at work know what your route and plans are, then if you don't show up at work on Monday, they'll figure out pretty quick that something might have happened and notify the authorities so they can start looking for you. A good movie that'll ensure you never go anywhere without telling anyone is 127 Hours. It's based on a true story of a solo hiker who got his arm pinched by a chockstone in a slot canyon. After 5 days of being stuck, he finally resorted to cutting his own arm off with a dull pocket knife, and hiked the rest of the way out. There was even a rappel at the end of the canyon, which he rigged and descended with a messy bleeding stump of an arm after going without food and water for days. This guy was pretty hardcore, but unfortunately, most people in these situations share Annie's fate, and die alone in the wilderness. I've solo'd countless hikes, but I take fewer risks when I'm alone, and always make sure people know where I'm going and when I'll be back. It's perfectly safe to go hiking alone as long as you take proper precautions, be prepared (bring a sharp knife with a bone saw!) and be smart on the trail. If you doubt your abilities, then it's probably best to stick with a group. 

With the exception that not all of the eggs hatched last year, the chicks grew fast and promptly flew the coup. Don't expect your birds to be around for long, they'll likely only be there a couple weeks after they hatch, then they'll be big enough to fly. Believe it or not, the picture of them above was taken on June 18th, and the picture below was taken on June 25th, that's how much they grew in only a week. 

I'm a side sleeper as well, and I've found that the gaps in my x-frame help give my hips and shoulders a little extra room when I'm on my side: 

Manufacturers all instruct that their screw gate carabiners be used in the upright position when attached to your harness, but in many cases it doesn't really matter as long as it's locked and there aren't any burrs in either end of the biner that could abraid the rope, and your ropes are properly managed. But in general, its always better to orient them up as recommended by the manufacturer, especially if using a device that requires you to feed the rope through the biner. Often lockers used in anchors will get burrs from metal on metal contact, usually in the end of the axis below the hinge, which can easily shred a rope. It's for this reason also that quickdraws have a rope and an anchor end, it can be disastrous if you swap them back and forth. Situations where orientation would matter more than others would depend on what type of descender and biner you're using. If you were descending with an ATC and a pear-shaped biner, then you should orient it up so the rope is rubbing on the nice round profile of the ofset. If you're using a figure 8 and a D-shaped carabiner, then it ultimately wouldn't make a difference. Orienting the screw gate down is a popular "gym technique". Gym techniques are typically implemented in an attempt to eliminate human error and avoid common mishaps, particularly by new or inexperienced climbers, but they are rarely considered proper use by manufacturers or experts. It's a known flaw of screwgate carabiners that they can come unlocked because of rubbing, or vibrations, which is why many climbers will use pairs oriented with their gates opposite and opposing, but this flaw is also why so many other alternatives to screw gates are available: Locksafe:
