After several years of exercise in my gym I consider hiring a fitness coach to improve my training. The main problem is that I am not really sure what I can expect from a fitness coach? What are the services I should request? I am not aiming to become a top athlete, I still see going to the gym as a hobby. Is paying for a fitness coach a good idea in this situation? 

I started to consume protein shakes (about 25g with milk and water) after hitting the gym to help me gain muscles. I also play flag football two times a week, where the training is more focused on endurance and agility. Does it make sense to consume protein shakes after the flag football training (which is basically cardio) as well or is it enough to consume extra protein after lifting weights (bodybuilding)? 

I usually do sports only in the afternoon or in the evening, because my body needs several hours to work properly after I get up in the morning. I can perform mental tasks very well in the morning and I am productive at work, but physical workout in the gym is entirely different. My main problem is that my joints are aching. My normal warm-up routine does not really help. I also do not know how I should handle eating. I usually eat about 2 hours before exercising. That's not possible if I want to start the training really early. An empty stomach does not work for me, because I lack motivation and I feel less energetic. This means I have to eat right before the training, which doesn't feel right either. Easy way out - just workout in the evening. Unfortunately I decided again to try exercising in the morning before work, because this would help my schedule a lot. How should I prepare for that? Which meals are good to consume right before training in the morning and how should I handle my aching joints? More warm-up? Less weight on the machines and barbells? Your help is appreciated - all my attempts to exercise before work have failed so far. 

When I pick up a new type of intense sport or when I train significantly more than usually during the course of a week, my body reacts with insatiable hunger. I usually consume about 2000 to 2500 calories per day, mostly protein and carbs. During those hunger periods I could easily eat 4 big meals during the day (3500 to 4000 calories) and still be hungry when I go to bed. That is definitely more than I burn, even with increased activity. How should I handle that? Should I simply listen to my body and eat until the hunger is gone or is my body overreacting to the challenge and I should stop eating after a certain point? I do not want to lose or gain weight, my goal is to stay fit and healthy. 

Coming from a Body Building background I have started experimenting with powerlifting recently. I especially like deadlifting a lot and want to improve my maximum weight for singles and doubles. After I improved my technique during the last weeks it became obvious, that my grip strength is my main sticking point. I can lift 140kg twice, but the second time I almost drop the weight because my grip is too weak. Especially the hand where the fingers point towards me fails. I am also able to do a single lift with 150kg using grip support, but could not do it without. How should I train my grip strength to align it with the rest of my body? My goal is to lift as much weight as possible without grip support. My only add-on are lifting gloves. 

I'm am doing body building as a hobby with 4 training sessions a week lasting for 60 to 90 minutes. I had good results with an intake of around 3.500 calories per day, the usual low carb diet. My goal is to build lean muscles. I started to play a game called Ingress a while ago, which requires to travel around town a lot and the fastest way for me is doing this on inline skates. Such an Ingress session can take really long, sometimes more than 6 hours constantly skating around. I mostly play on my off-days, but sometimes even some hours before or after the gym. As the summer approaches, especially when I am on vacation and have even more time to spare, I expect these sessions to expand further. Currently I do not see any negative impact on my body building progress, but I guess sooner or later those extended cardio sessions will lead to exhaustion or cut too much into my energy reserves which will decrease my potential for muscle growth. How should I compensate for this? I don't want to reduce my Ingress playing time but I also want to progress with body building. Is it enough to add more calories to my diet to compensate for the calories burned during cardio? Which types of food are recommended for this? And do I also need to increase the amount of sleep I get if I don't feel tired during the day? 

Some people like models or actors have to look their best for certain occasions like a shooting. They have special training programs and diets that allow them to improve their looks within several weeks to an impressive degree what I have heard. What are they doing to achieve these results? I am not talking about long lasting or healthy measures to get in shape, I know enough about those. I wonder what one can do to boost his looks within a few weeks, aiming to look the best at a specific time, no matter what. 

I work about 40 to 45 hours a week at my office, sitting most of the time. My company allows me to adjust my time table and I can arrange my working hours as I like, as long as the job gets done. I want to increase my productivity during working hours, so I analyzed my daily productivity curve. Morning is perfect for me, I achieve a lot from 9am until lunch break, which I usually take around 1pm. Afterwards I often feel drowsy and my motivation starts to lack, especially after eating too much. Sometimes this condition lasts for several hours, affecting my productivity more than I like. The first two changes I want to make to improve this situation is sleeping more during the night and changing my diet to lighter meals for lunch. I am also considering hitting the gym after lunch (it is in the same building as my office) to get fresh energy. Now I need to find out, which kind of training will help me to regain my mental fitness for my work in the afternoon. Which exercises would be good and how long should I work out? Including a quick shower I do not want to spend more than an hour, but I guess more wouldn't help my cause anyway. Should I start my workout right after I ate or is it better to wait a little? Or is this a bad idea all together and it wouldn't help me to achieve my goal? 

It seems to be common knowledge that you should consume your protein shake right after a training session for best effect. The sooner the better. I wonder why you shouldn't consume your shake right before the training or during training? It takes some time for the body to process the protein anyway, therefore it seems to make more sense to consume it sooner. Would the body use the expensive protein as simple energy source and waste it or is the answer more complex? 

There are some exercises in my training routine that I cannot perform without my whole upper body trembling like crazy. Pushing dumbbells to train breast or shoulder muscles is one example. I use dumbbells that I can push 3x12 times. I can perform the motions slow and exact - I am sure the weight of the dumbbells I use fits the exercise well. Nevertheless my whole upper body trembles during this exercise right from the start until the end. People spotting me for the first time think that I am already at my limit and that I am about to fail, when in reality I am perfectly comfortable. What can cause that trembling and what can I do about it? Should I ignore it or might there be a problem with the exercise? 

Assuming a strict diet and training schedule, there should be a limit to how much muscle growth the average person can expect within a given time frame. To be more specific, lets assume the person has 70kg and just started to go to the gym 3 times a week. How much muscle (in kg) can be gained on average within a month? I am looking for a rough benchmark here because it obviously depends a lot on many other variables. I am also interested in the differences between men and women concerning muscle growth expectations. 

I hear from time to time that people consider it valuable to perform conditioning training until you cannot go on any longer. Some people I have talked to are proud that they have trained until they broke down or had to throw up. This does not sound really healthy to me. Does such intense training make sense or is this just useless and maybe even harmful torture for your body? 

I am currently visiting the gym 3 times a week for about 1,5 hours to work on my upper body. My goal is to gain muscles and add a little bit of definition. On the weekends I go to the ice ring for about 2 hours of freestyle ice skating to get my cardio done. For relaxation, removing muscle tensions and especially to get more flexible I am planning to incorporate Nuad Thai massages at least twice a month into my schedule. This type of massage focuses on stretching the muscles and seems to be a valuable addition to my normal stretching routine. Now I am wondering if it makes a difference when I do this. It is definitely less painful when my muscles are not sore, but it also might help with regeneration of those muscles. Would it be a good idea to go to the massage on a day where I visit the gym or the ice ring or should it be on an off day? If it is during a training day, is it better to go before or after the training? Any other input concerning Nuad Thai and the benefits or maybe even drawbacks for fitness training and stretching is also appreciated. 

I am currently going to the gym 3 times a week doing 2 alternating workouts. I am 31 years old and in a healthy condition. During some weeks I feel the need to do more. I am sitting at home during the days I should spend resting but I have too much energy left and need to get out. This week I went to the gym a 4th time and I really enjoyed it. I know that missing out on resting time is bad for muscle growth. That's why I wonder how I should deal with this situation. Is it OK to mix in extra sessions now and then or should I stick to my schedule no matter what? Should I rather do some extra cardio on rest days instead of an extra session weight lifting? Or are there muscles that are more tolerable than others? For example would it be OK to train my stomach muscles more often but not my biceps?
