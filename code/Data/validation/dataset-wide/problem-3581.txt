From personal experience I found that the crackling and popping is most intense when I have a lot of muscle tightness and I haven't stretched in a long time. I also notice being sedentary or immobile for long periods of times aggravates it further. My personal approach to reducing joint pain and crackling sounds is by foam rolling, stretching and doing dynamic stretching (mobility). I would spend a lot of time improving my flexibility and make sure the joints are fully warmed up. To improve range of motion you can do: 

Finally, here's a warm up guide I wrote a while ago, which includes foam rolling, static and dynamic stretching. 

It's all about presentation really. Before I officially became a personal trainer I started out randomly helping people at the gym. Out of the hundreds I've given advice to only a handful took it negatively and even then we just didn't see eye to eye and life goes on. First thing is to weigh how helpful your advice against the fact that you are going to interrupt their workout/take their time. I would only say something if it's something major or the person involved clearly is a novice and is struggling. Here's how I do it: 

Gynecomastia "Round pecs that are nearly pointed" sounds like Gynecomastia. Unfortunately if that's the case surgery is the only reliable treatment. You can talk with a doctor, specifically an Endocrinologist, and see if they would recommend some type of hormonal treatment. Losing bodyfat might help but if there is significant gland development that won't go down with bodyfat reduction. 

Yes, you should worry. I'd go see a doctor who may refer you to physio - not sure how it works in Germany sorry. Essentially, due to the slant in the pavement, you've been putting one knee (leg) under more abnormal pressure then the other. Running in reverse around the block is probably going to cause the same pain in the other knee. Seriously, I'd find a flat surface to run on. If need be, use a treadmill. Boring I know, but at least you can run without having to worry about causing damage to your joints. You will end up doing some serious damage to your knee(s) by continuing to run on this slanted ground. Doing stretches as suggested by @DizzyDrakefL0w I wouldn't recommend. You don't "stretch" joint pains! 

Honestly, I think you need to start working out more consistently. Every 2 to 5 days is not consistent and if you expect to get results from that, you probably won't. Strength training and muscle gain both require a lot of commitment to both your workout/training and your diet. It varies from person to person but expect 45 to 60 minute high intensity sessions at least 4 to 5 times a week. Use that as a guide to build on. You might be consuming 2700 calories a day but not all calories are equal. You need high quality, nutrient dense calories - lots of proteins, fats and carbs from good quality natural foods. Stay away from that packaged garbage that is full of artificial colors, flavors and preservatives. On the topic of calories, consume the same every day while trying to gain strength. When you want to cut/drop fat, then you can start cycling your calorie intake. You need to fuel your body. If you are sore, tough it up and train through it anyway. If it really is that bad, try taking some magnesium each day. It will help with recovery. Also look at split routines so you aren't directly training the same muscles each day. Do chest and triceps one day, front half of legs the next, back and biceps the next, rear half of legs next, then do core and bodyweight exercises - that's just a quick guide anyway. Hope some of that helps. 

My son asked me to take a look at this question. I'm a second-generation phlebologist, myself the son of the man who coined the word "Sclerotherapy" (=injection treatment of varicose veins) in 1939, and who founded the organization currently called the "American College of Phlebology" (it started as the "Phlebology Society of America", which I ran for about 3-4 years, until politics reared its ugly head). I almost never advise any patient to avoid any exercise because of varicose veins. The only exceptions to this are (1) if they've just been treated for their veins, or (2) if they have a spontaneous phlebitis. People with phlebitis know there's something wrong, and since virtually all cases of varicose vein-linked phlebitis are what's called "superficial" phlebitis, which is generally harmless but very painful, I presume such people are in sufficient pain that they don't need to be specifically told to lay off exercises until they've been attended to. Note that most varicose vein patients will NEVER get phlebitis as long as they live, so, statistically speaking, this is not a huge problem. The second category, patients who have just been treated, do not need to stop exercising in general. If, post-treatment, I've put them into a compression stocking, or ace bandages, I advise them to do their regular exercises while wearing whatever such device has been recommended. In this office, bandages/stockings are seldom prescribed for more than a week (there are innumerable bandaging/stocking protocols of varying lengths, some up to 6 weeks, but none of them, including mine, have been proven "correct" by controlled studies). I also recommend holding off on exercises in which the legs are pumping vigorously in a position higher than the heart, such as exercises where one is lying on one's back and lifting weights with their legs. I must add, however, that the risk of exercising the legs in a position higher than the heart, which is a risk of pulmonary embolus (blood clot to the lungs), is purely THEORETICAL, and I have never, in 35 years of practice, either seen or heard of any case where ANY exercise has actually caused a blood clot to migrate. I should perhaps add that, in the vast majority of cases, there are NO BLOOD CLOTS in varicose veins, and, as I said above, in most cases none will ever develop. In general, I'd advise any person who has varicose veins, and who is involved in an exercise program, to proceed with the program as if they had no disease at all (and I should add that it hasn't been proven that varicose veins is, in most cases, even a "disease" in the first place; it may be a normal variation of circulatory anatomy/physiology, comparable to being very short or tall). If the veins really interfered with exercise, that would presumably mean that the legs ached with prolonged standing. Even people with such varicose symptoms, however, will usually be RELIEVED by exercise. But if the case is severe, and even the exercises do not, by themselves, relieve the aching, then the next step is to wear a compression stocking to the gym. If that doesn't solve the problem, then the veins need to be taken care of. There are lots of phlebologists around these days, and they're not all incompetent (only some). 

Waste of time and money. If you're really that interested in your body fat % and want something that is going to be as accurate as possible, have a DEXA scan done or hydrostatic weighing. 

The best answer for you is a healthy and nutritious diet. You can achieve what you want simply by putting the right foods and drinks in your mouth and you won't have to lift a single weight or walk a single mile. Lots of veggies, salads, some fruit, lean meats (chicken, Turkey, beef), fatty fish like salmon and trout. Get rid of or at least cut down (significantly) on sugary drinks, alcohol, fast foods, anything high in carbohydrates - especially high GI carbs. When cooking, use extra virgin olive oil, butter, or coconut oil. Avoid margarine. Fat loss is made in the kitchen. You can't out train a crap diet. First and foremost, get your diet in check, and then worry about exercising if you wish. 

The first 2 so called 'facts' you've listed I think you may find that with a little more research are not actually FACT. I really don't believe it matters when you eat. If 30 minutes before you go to bed is when you eat your last meal, then that's exactly when you eat. The whole 'no carbs before bed' thing is a bit of a myth based on everything I've read. I'm actually yet to come across an article backed by some kind of science that proves that carbs before bed are actually bad for you or will have adverse/negative affects. So long as you don't consume more than daily intake of carbs / calories in total (or the rest of your macros for that matter) whether you eat them all in the morning, all at night, or divide them up evenly throughout the day makes no difference. I personally drink 300-350ml of full-fat milk, a scoop of protein powder, huge handful of blueberries, cocoa, cinnamon and spirulina about 20-30 minutes before bed (sometimes I will throw in a banana also). I've been doing this for a "long" time and wouldn't change it for the world. Honestly, try it. Have your last meal as soon as you can after your workout - and then go to bed. I think you'll find it makes no difference.
