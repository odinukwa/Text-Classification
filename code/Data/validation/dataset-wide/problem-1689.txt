I haven't had a chance to check and make sure this is for sure what you are looking for, but I'm reasonably sure that what you want is to use the People.asmx web service, SearchPrincipals method. It returns a collection of user principals, and one of the fields is UserInfoID . 

The VBS script you use can't be just a generic VBS script - there are certain methods that it must implement (even if you just define the function and it does nothing). Perhaps this is your problem? Check out this MSDN page for some information on how to write a generic script and what functions you must implement. 

I'm a fan of pyinstaller over py2exe, but have used both pretty successfully in the past. Agree with @Satanicpuppy that more info is needed. 

If you are talking about changing the collector to use a CSV by default, it is a setting in Perfmon itself. On the Log Files tab of your counter, you change the "log file type" to be Text File (comma delimited). 

Yes, the limit is for everything under the webapp. If you plan on increasing it significantly, you may also need to increase some other settings in IIS and/or SharePoint to make sure connections don't timeout. In IIS: Connection Timeout limit In SharePoint: large file chunk size See this post for some good insights on this. It is old, but not outdated I think. 

SharePoint integrated mode is not supported in SSRS Express Edition. See the feature list on MSDN for details. $URL$ 

You should only need the (inbound) TCP port that your website is running on (80 or 443 if using SSL typically.) 

SharePoint will allow you to upload any type of file and have it controlled by document versioning. (Assuming it is under the upper size limit, and not in the blocked file types list.) Whether you want to or not is another question. Depending on the size of the files/etc. it may be "cheaper" to find another solution. See this article for some general storage recommendations. It was targeted at WSS (SharePoint 2007) but I think it still applies in 2010. 

I think when you are running SSRS in native mode, the most integration you can get with SharePoint is to use the Reporting Services Web Parts for viewing reports from your SQL Server. Take a look at this blog post for setup details: $URL$ 

After installing ARR, there will be a new category in IIS Manager called "Server Farms" - right click that and create a new farm. 

What you want to do is create a new List Template, and create all your new libraries based off of that, instead of the standard Document Library template. 

Remove the "Windows Process Activation Service" and IIS features from the computer, then reinstall them. Do an "OS Repair" installation of windows, due to the component based services catalog being corrupt. An OS Repair install would fix that. 

if you get 1 row back, the hotfix (and therefore RSAT, and therefore Hyper-V manager) are installed, otherwise it is not. 

Do you have Windows Firewall enabled? Check in Services to see if Windows Firewall is started. If so, check out the Windows Firewall control panel to disable and/or change settings. 

Now, if you plan on implementing Search Server Express on top of WSS, I would say you need to up the ram to 8gb and put the search indexes out on some fast RAID 10. Here is the documentation for WSS performance planning: $URL$ And here is the link for Search Server: $URL$ 

By default, nmap only scans for "common" ports (the 1000 most common ports per protocol I believe). Since 789 is not a common port it isn't found. If you do 

Which will change the app pool for the web site specified by to be whatever is specified in - this app pool must already exist. Writing a wrapper around this in your favorite language should be pretty trivial if you are already talking about using C# to do this. Also, if you aren't familiar with it, adsutil.vbs typically exists in 

You can directly call the SharePoint APIs through Powershell. Here are some links to help out: $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ 

Hyper-V does not support promiscuous mode in the guest NICs. See this technet discussion for a little more detail: $URL$ 

Most likely your problem is that your database is setup to only have logins defined for administrative users. Go into Management Studio as an admin user, and go to the Security -> Logins category. You probably only have some built in SQL users, and . Right click the Logins category, and choose "New Login..." - from there you can add your non-admin user and give it the sysadmin server role. This will give it admin rights to the database while leaving it as a normal user on the Windows system. 

SCOM 2007 R2 still does not support SQL 2008 R2 for existing installations. The latest cumulative update for SCOM (CU#3) was just released November 15 and didn't include support, so you will have a while to wait for a CU to cover it. You may be able to contact Microsoft Support and see if a hotfix is available through that route instead. 

There is a checkbox at the root level of the Server Manager that says "do not show me this console at logon" - check it, and then close Server Manager. You need to do this for each account you log onto the server with, and for each server you logon to. 

Unfortunately, I think WSS doesn't have an RSS feed for search results - which means it isn't usable as a Win7 Federated Search source. If your WSS environment is single-server, you could upgrade for free to Search Server 2008 Express and gain this functionality (and a lot of other cool stuff). If you have a multi-server WSS farm, then I don't think it is possible without paying to upgrade to MOSS or Search Server 2008 

It really isn't possible, even in a hacky/unsupported sort of way. See the following blog entry and related Microsoft Connect bug report: $URL$ $URL$ 

Are you using the Windows 2003 version of devcon? I don't think it is 100% compatible with Windows 2008. Try downloading the WDK from Microsoft and extracting the newest version from there. link text The newest x64 version is in: - extract the file and rename to . The proper version of the file should be 6.1.7600.16385. 

You can change the Search Center to use for your site by going to Site Actions -> All Site Settings -> Site Collection Administration -> Search Settings. The URL you need to change this to must be a site configured using the "Search Center" or "Search Center with Tabs" template. 

Are you getting any errors in your event logs or sharepoint logs? Once common cause for this is the "Unknown Alias" error. See documentation and fix here: $URL$ 

Sharepoint 2010 has introduced the new concept of "managed accounts" - basically, it stores the encrypted credentials for whatever service accounts you specify. Initially, the passphrase is used to encrypt the credentials for storage. When you want to do things such as add a new server to the farm (from the server itself via powershell) you will be prompted for the passphrase instead of for the username/password as in the past. The whole concept of managed accounts allows the passwords to be changed in AD without having to change the password everywhere the account is used in SharePoint. The complexity of changing the password in the past typically meant that the SharePoint service accounts were exempt from enterprise password change policies (which is a bad thing). Managed accounts mostly alleviates this problem, and can even go so far as to automatically change the password for you before it would expire due to policy. Here is the technet overview of the managed password feature (which the passphrase is used for...) $URL$
