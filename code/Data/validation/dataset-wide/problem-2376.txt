Sensual desire (kamacchanda) Ill-will (byapada) Sloth and torpor(thina-middha) Restlessness and remorse (uddhacca-kukkucca) Skeptical doubt (vicikiccha) 

I do not see anything wrong with the usage here. Following is the definition of Sankhara given by the Buddha in Kajjaniya Sutta SN 22.79. 

Merits(punya/the good deeds) as well as the bad deeds can be transferred/dedicated(anumodana) to others. But there is an element of action involved at the receiving end. For example; someone commits a noble deed and transfers that merit to me. To receive the merit, I should endorse and acknowledge the action. This is usually expressed as "Sadhu! Sadhu! Anumodami". Same applies for evil deeds. 

Correct me if I'm wrong about my current understanding of Buddhism: There is no eternal self or essence in me, but am just a conditioned-self, an illusion created by the interaction of the five aggregates. Each time I do something, or will something, its this distorted conditioned-self in play, right? Now, I want to understand what happens to this conditioned self when we die. You say its just an illusion, but lets take a practical example: A person dies in New York, and then is being reborn in Washington D.C the next moment. So here, you want to say the conditioned-self (illusion) travelled all the way from New York to D.C. to affect his/her next birth? As a corollary to this question, I would also like to understand the technicality of . Say a person violates the precept of non-killing in New York in his/her present birth. How does the know whom to punish 50 years later when that same person is reborn in D.C.? (You may say here that there is no external law-maker, but is just in our . But that's still begging the question - How does it know whom to punish 50 years later?) 

With or without intention, volitional actions are defined as kamma. For example, killing an animal in excruciating pain while the intention was to free it from agony. Even in habitual or involuntary actions, there might be an element of intention. It is just the lack of awareness or mindfulness. For example; one could slap a mosquito involuntarily; but the thought process required to kill is complete, hence bad kamma is accumulated. 

Each time I remember or reflect upon this choir, I get a profound feeling of . I know that even thinking about this is also a sign of attachment, as even those thoughts are impermanent. But is it wrong to get energized or inspired by a choir, even if the inspiration is towards the path of enlightenment? As a side note, has such an anecdote really happened with Gautam Buddha? Is there such a mention in any suttas? 

We are not necessarily re-incarnations of prior human beings. There are 31 planes of existence in Buddhism. So the present human beings could result from any of the 26 planes out of 31 planes of existence(except 5 non-returner Bhrama realms) which consist of unaccountably large number of beings. For example, imagine the number of beings living in Animals realm (tiracchana yoni). 

In short, 'world' is relative to one's six sense experience. And six sense(Salayathana) bases are made out of past karma(cause) and the experience based on those senses are vipaka(effect). So the 31 planes of existence is nothing but 31 levels of sense base experiences. This is can be further explained if we analyze the availability of senses in Kama Loka, Rupa Loka and Arupa Loka: 

A mention regarding this could be found in Ashoka Vadana , a Buddhist text that describes the birth and achievements of Emperor Ashoka the great, perhaps one of the most prominent Buddhist Kings described in the literature. Though Ashoka turned to Buddhism after having seen the perils of destruction in the Kalinga war and generally followed the principle of non-violence, the text describes that Ashoka did break the first precept many times in order to fulfill his military tasks. For instance, 

I would like to know if there exist a PDF version of Tripitaka which is compatible with an eBook reader(Kindle, Kobo alike)? 

Here is how I see this: First off let's not forget the definition of 'World/Loka'. Refer to Rohitassa Sutta or Loka Sutta 

Atheism falls under ucchedavāda which was vehemently rejected by the Buddha. It is one of two extremes that Buddha avoided by revealing the middle way; Pratītyasamutpāda. 

There are two things I want to understand here. Firstly, though I'm not overly disturbed by thoughts during vipassana sitting, I just don't know how do I treat them. What I presently do is just try to ignore them and continue observing the . But if the thoughts are too strong and persist, I tend to observe them impartially until they leave of their own accord (but during this time my observance of has stopped). Am I doing this thing rightly or not? Secondly, I want to understand the reality of thoughts. I know that ultimately none of these have permanent reality, but compared to what is the ? Basically, I want to know whether they have any objective reality, or they are subjective (just things in my head)? I recently read in a book that reality keeps vibrating each and every instant, and we need to look into the arising/vanishing of these vibrations, as that is what is all about. My question is do these vibrations apply to thoughts as well or just sensations? 

In short, modern scientists analyze the external universe from quarks to quasars in pursuit of "the ultimate reality". On the contrary, we Buddhists analyze the matter in our sense experience as patavi, apo, thejo, wayo - Mahābhūta to get rid of the dilution (avijja) caused by Vijñāna(~consciousness) projected on Mahābhūta. This is the intention of kayanupassana as described in the great Satipattana Sutta. 

According to Buddhism, everything(except nibbana) is subject to causality(Sankatha) and everything arises dependently (Paticcasamuppanna) and there is no exception to space and time! In the Pali Canon, the term Aggregate(Skandha) is defined as follows; 

A few years ago, I read in the introduction of a Spirituality book about this story of Gautam Buddha. I've forgotten the name of the book, but this poetry has stuck in my memory for ever. The story goes something like this: The young prince Siddhartha is sitting in the garden, having felt disgusted by the vanity of the celebrations going on in the palace. That's when he hears a group of celestial beings passing by singing melodious choirs: 

If it is difficult to comprehend the explanation given in Aggañña Sutta; how about focusing your energy to understand Loka Sutta, SN 12.44? If you can realize this explanation, there will not be any doubt about Aggañña Sutta. Loka Sutta, SN 12.44 

Also, this is evident as attaining to Rupa Jhana will result a birth in Rupa Bhrama world and attaining Arupa Jhana will result a birth in Arupa worlds. So 31 planes of existence is 31 levels of deceived karmic experience. For example, If a being is deceived to the 6 sense bases; that's called Kama loka.
