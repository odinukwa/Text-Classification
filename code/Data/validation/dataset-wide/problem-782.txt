Is there a clear cut between them? How long and how bright will the moon be for a dark night? I googled but could not find a definition for them. People just talk about them empirically? 

Fast-moving objects near our earth have different paths in the sky. They are different with stars far away. For telescopes, when we do not know an object's orbit, catching up with its orbit and not losing it is a problem ? How to figure out a new object's orbit parameters quickly before we lose it? For an old object with an irregular orbit, can a telescope track it? The typical speed in the asteroid belt may be smaller than 1"/min? But there may be faster objects. Then the paths are not so simple and regular. 

What are the differences between the discoveries of Sedna, 2012vp 113, and the supposed Planet 9? All need deep infrared surveys at the ecliptic plane, but P9 needs a much deeper survey? 

Generally a telescope can memorize how to point to a target with a particular RA&Dec. There is no need to calibrate every day. How can it happen? How to let the telescope(non-amateur) know the position of a star after it was built? For an amateur telescope, how to realize it? There should be a zero point? How often should the calibration be? 

After folding a light curve, we may get some kind of shape. How to tell whether there is a real periodical signal quantifiably? The fluctuation may be small, and the folded shape may not be perfect. 

@tefalya Somebody told me "EM is the integral of electron density squared over the emitting volume. In collisional ionized plasmas, it gives the amount of material emitting at a given temperature. In the low density regime, temperature, emission measure, and abundance together with an atomic code completely specify the observed spectral energy distribution of coronal plasma. The normalization parameter you get out of APEC, MEKAL, etc. relate to the emission measure. If you read the description of the APEC model in XSPEC, you will see that the normalization = 10^-14* n_e^2 dV/(4 !pi distance^2). The Emission Measure EM is n_e^2 dV, and has units of cm^-3. So the emission measure is an observable, and by assuming that the volume is not changing significantly during the flare, the changing emission measure is a proxy for the changing electron density." 

I met this kind of finding chart before, but now I can not easily find one in ADS. The small window in the upper left is a zoomed-in version of the window in the center. Could anybody identify any finding chart like the attachment in ADS and specify how to generate it? 

the circular area around the Earth is more or less the area (there's a velocity dependence here which I'm not getting into) in which a moon-like body can form a reasonably stable orbit. The size of the small "well" will increase as the planet moves farther from the sun, and also when the planet is more massive. Jupiter is both pretty far away from the Sun, and is very massive. This leads to a huge sphere of influence. The asteroid belt may have something to do with this too, but I doubt it (it's pretty far away). However, if we assume the "half-baked planet formation" theory for the formation of the belt, Jupiter may have leeched off much of the mass that would have otherwise become part of that planet during the formative period. 

Any gas that has a lower atomic mass than iron. The only condition on the gas is that nuclear fusion with it should be exothermic (the energy required to fuse the nuclei should be less than the energy obtained). However, usually a majority of hydrogen is the best. If the majority gas is of a higher element, we'll need a sufficient gravitational force to initiate the fusion, and that's not always easy. While it is possible for just hydrogen to start fusion in a star, some carbon or nitrogen is a good thing to have to start fusion more efficiently. Different initial conditions lead to different kinds of stars. 

On the outset this seems true, however there are other forces at play here. Our measurement devices are held together by electromagnetic interactions, and the strength of these will not change. So the measurement device will hold itself together. Imagine two faraway atoms. When space expands, the distance between the two atoms increases. However, the size1 of the atom does not — this is determined by electrostatic equilibrium (and quantum mechanical considerations), and this remains unaffected. Even if the atom was stretched, it would rebound. This scales up to measurement devices, so they don't get distorted either. Indeed, the expansion of space only really makes sense when you look at galaxies — these are pretty far away (when not in the same supercluster) and they don't have any interactions maintaining an equilibrium distance between them. 1. Whatever closest analog we have to "size" for atoms; eg the area which contains 99% of the charge density; or the nth Bohr radius. 

Yes. It does not rotate uniformly though, different portions have a different angular velocity (as a body made of plasma, it can get away with this). Measuring this in theory is pretty easy, we just need to track the motion of the sunspots. This isn't as simple as calculating the changes in relative positions of the sunspots, though, as the Earth is rotating and revolving, which makes the calculations harder. This measurement can be done using the celestial sphere (the field of stars that we see) as a "fixed" reference point and seeing how the Earth and the sunspots move relative to that. Almost everything in the universe rotates/revolves, at least a little bit, because angular momentum is hard to get rid of. It can be transferred from body to body, but for a body to end up with zero angular momentum, it needs to meet another body with the exact same angular momentum and collide with it in a particular way. Given that this is pretty rare, all celestial bodies rotate. In addition to that, a non rotating body that is revolving will eventually start spinning due to tidal forces. 

When this diagram is mentioned in textbooks, we do not say which kind of pulsars are included at all. Why? $p-\dot{p}$ diagram only shows radio pulsars? no! you can see magnetars,radio quiet pulsars and pulsars which are only active in $\gamma-ray$ Except magnetars, there are no single pulsars only pulse in X-ray band? If a pulsar pulses in X-ray band, that does not necessarily mean it is an X-ray pulsar? Only pulsars in binaries and accretion-powered pulsars could be called X-ray pulsars? They should be radio-quiet? In binaries, there are no pulsars which pulse in radio and x-ray band simultaneously? 

The data precision now can exclude a >>$1M_{\odot}$ black hole companion, which has a, say 10000 year orbital period with our sun? Can we draw a two dimensional diagram(Mass VS. distance) to show the region that is still a grey area? Within 1 pc, there is no stellar mass black hole? If there is one, the orbit change of objects in solar system may be detectable. How to calculate its proper motion or its planets' proper motion? I am serious to ask. Please give some reference/technical method to calculate PM. For example, is there some reference paper about the distance limitation of the black hole based on the motion of asteroids/comets? 

Vela X-1 has a 283s spin period, while this one may have a 2.7hr spin period. However neither of them is included in ATNF catalog. They are not included in $p-\dot{p}$ diagram either. The longest period is just about 10s in this diagram. My question is since Vela X-1 is definitely a pulsar, why is it not accepted? Which one has the longest spin period so far? 

The LIGO team argue they detected the merger of two solar mass black holes($36M\odot+29M\odot-3M\odot$) at z=0.09. My questions are It seems GW has Doppler shift too. There is a GW spectrum with emission or absorption lines like optical spectrum? Figure.2 of the PRL paper seems to be very simple. Generally, people take their masses derived seriously? There may be other models which can give different masses. It is different from Taylor binary which was observed many years. What does a 100HZ GW mean? That is the frequency of the two arms shrink and extend? What does the frequency stand for in the binary system? The discovery can not be confirmed. DO you think the team win a Nobel prize only after other facilities like LISA find GW again? 

I have two series of velocities (HJD, $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$ ), how to fit in detail? There is any formula on the web? $sine$ curve is easy, but I need to consider an eccentric orbit. Suppose we can estimate $m_{1}$, $m_{2}$, and inclination angle $\approx80^{\circ}$, if we just know velocities of both of the two companions, which parameters can me derive? What is the difference between binary velocity fitting and star+planet fitting? 

It would, if there were no interactions. However, everyday matter is held together by other kinds of forces (electromagnetic, mainly). These are quite strong, and any "stretching" of space will be counteracted by these forces "pulling" the atom/molecule/object back to its original size. So the expansion of the universe only matters on the larger, cosmic scale, between objects like galaxies which are separated by a large enough distance that they don't affect each other too much, gravitationally speaking. 

Bigger is better. Most moons, especially those of gas giants, are not "formed", they are just "captured" (unlike our Moon, which could have been captured, but probably was formed in a much more exciting way). Jupiter is the most massive planet in the solar system. It stands to reason that it has a larger region of gravitational influence (where its influence outweighs the force due to the other planets and the sun). So, it's easy for it to capture rocky masses. If you have a look at the contours on the following image (Ignore the Lagrange points marked on it, I only want the contours) 

That's the part of the universe that is visible to us right now. In other words, we map it from light we receive from that zone right now, so the part being mapped is actually many, many years old. Usually this doesn't make a big difference because we're careful to analyze regions where the variation in the time of viewing is not large compared to the length scale. Actually, from the relativity point of view, it's almost as good as the faraway bodies being in the state they were billions of years ago as far as we are concerned. From our reference frame, they may have a "future" (really, the "present", but calling it that gets a bit icky) but we just have no way of knowing it. 

With all this in mind, the simple solution of heliocentrism explains everything in a much cleaner fashion, without leaving much doubt in mind. Kepler's laws make much cleaner predictions. Remember that people had catalogs of astronomical data to verify things with. Later on, once Newton came up with his theory of gravitation, Kepler's laws made even more sense (though I believe that Newton formulated his theory with some inspiration from Kepler's laws). I'm pretty sure that there were on-Earth experiments to verify the inverse-square as well. Nowadays, sending probes to space and getting a different perspective has confirmed this with 100% certainity for us. More or less. 

There's some angular momentum to the initial gas cloud, which is a bunch of gas particles with varying velocities. The angular momentum of this will not add up to zero usually, so as the cloud coalesces the resultant accretion disk will have a spin.
