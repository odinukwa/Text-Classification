For this to work, you're going to have to throw out gravity as we know it. If the interstellar fluid repels other matter, but not itself, other matter will form bubbles within it. Think what happens if you drip oil onto the surface of water - the oil forms round droplets, and if droplets come into contact with each-other, then they'll coalesce into a larger droplet. Depending on the precise nature of the boundary effects, you may be able to create sufficient pressure in a sufficiently large droplet of hydrogen in order to achieve a fusion reaction, as well as providing a force similar to that of gravity on the surface of a world. A universe of this sort would be quite different to our own. There would be no orbits as we know them; it is more likely that objects would move as a result of thermal convection in the interstellar fluid, and this movement could be rather chaotic. A world may be in motion relative to a star by virtue of being caught in a convection cell, with planetary rotation induced by boundary effects between neighbouring convection cells. An interesting quirk of this is that day length could vary considerably depending on the position of the world within its convection current, and it might be ejected from its current to another one at some point in time. The interstellar fluid may carry a significant amount of heat around a star, allowing for planets to be warm even on their dark side. Interstellar travel would be slowed to a degree dependant on the viscosity of the interstellar fluid, though it would also provide a medium against which a ship could push using propellers. It should also be possible to sail the convection currents. With a combination of these two methods, interstellar travel should be possible. 

Santa's Elves are a distinct species, separate from other species of elves, characterised by their submissiveness, lack of imagination, endless patience, love of stable, predictable environments, and delight in performing repetitive, menial tasks. So, far from feeling oppressed by Santa, Santa's Elves thank Santa daily for providing them with the environment that they enjoy most - one of servitude, stability and order, where the need to think for themselves and improvise is minimised. For such beings, thanks is unnecessary - they thank Santa for employing them, and for providing a stable, unchanging environment. Promotion to a position of greater responsibility - and by logical extension, to a position of less predictability - is seen by the Santa's Elves as a precursor to the end-of-life exile of Santa's Elves who are no longer productive on the barren surface of the arctic icecap where their lives will undoubtedly be brought to a close by hungry polar bears. Fortunately, though, Santa's Elves are a long-lived species, and only a few elves each year become too weak or senile to be useful. Indeed, that a Santa's Elf could become unproductive is a matter of great shame for it and its fellows, and Santa himself doesn't have to intervene, as the Santa's Elves themselves will help their senile, failing relatives up to the surface to die all by themselves, frequently thanked by the exiled Santa's Elf for their assistance in expiating the shame associated with uselessness. Santa's Elves do not care for glory; their joy is in repetitive labour, predictable environments and usefulness. They care little that Santa gains the credit for their work so long as their work keeps coming. They do not even care what they do, as long as they are useful and that the work is predictable. The greatest horror for a Santa's Elf - aside from uselessness - would be to be forced to improvise, to work with unpredictable tools and materials and to be required to interact with the end-user of the product they make. This is in distinct contrast to their relatives, the Scandinavian Svart-alfr and Dverge. The former are similar to the Santa's Elves, and while also gregarious and also enjoy subterranean environments, are more chaotic, independent and flighty. The latter are also subterranean, but are more solitary, and while they take a delight in labour, they insist on generous payment and only work on projects that interest them, which are typically different from any previous project. 

Split the world, having magic in one half of the world, and in the other half of the world, have science. The split in the world is in a fourth dimension, making physical travel from one side to the other difficult. The two philosophies are incompatible in their most advanced states. Magic allows for effects that cannot be produced by science (yet?), but magic comes at a cost that limits its use and making it expensive. 

Don't get quite so carried away, now. There would not be world-wide earthquakes, and probably not even extinctions (there weren't last time), and really only north America would be severely affected, while the rest of the world experienced a year or so of cooler temperatures. Caldera eruptions are now not considered extinction-level events, though they would certainly have deleterious effects on human civilization in the surrounding areas. Humanity would certainly survive, though there would be a large number of deaths in north America. Plants would start to reappear in the ash-covered landscape within ten years, or more rapidly if humans assisted matters. See $URL$ for more information. 

Since a mirror not reflecting light only coming from certain objects that is otherwise visible to the human is not a possibility in our universe, the possibility exists that your universe is a simulation, and a bug in the simulation means that light reflecting or emitting from certain classes of object cannot reflect again. I.e. Light comes from a light source and reflects off all objects in line of sight. We can see this light. However, due to the universe's bug, light from the prosthetic - or light from the whole 'vampire', depending on how objects are classified - cannot be reflected again, and hence cannot be seen in reflections from any object. Depending on the nature of the bug, the simulation might leave a black space where the vampire should be, or it may substitute light from behind the vampire, rendering it invisible in reflection. 

The problem with 'Luck' is that it is a human concept applied to the quantum workings of the universe, which itself does not care if one macroscopic system is favoured by the vagaries of chance while another is harmed by the vagaries of chance, or is also favoured, or has no net benefit or loss from its point of view. Put more simply: Our universe simply doesn't care how many people get lucky or unlucky. This leaves us with two possibilities: 

Assuming that you have a science fantasy setting where you have ridiculously high accelerations, the most obvious solution is to digitize the passengers and crew. However, if you must accelerate human bodies, but allow modifications, then the solution to this problem is a variety of fluid immersion where the body is immersed and ports are placed in otherwise sealed or low-fluid-transfer-rate bodily cavity walls to allow rapid pressure equalization. The immersion fluid would have a density as close as possible to the average density of soft tissues or a bit more. Soft tissues with a lower density could be artificially made denser by adding mass at a nanoscopic level of detail in order to distribute it as evenly as possible. Where we have significantly denser hard tissues such as bone, it should be interwoven with and partially replaced by a strong light substance such as carbon fiber at a microscopic level. Numerous sockets would be built into the bones and ports placed in the skin so that under acceleration, the bones can be mechanically anchored to an external structure to prevent differential movement within the body. In order to further equalize the density difference between the body's fluids and solid structures, a significant amount of the oxygen-16 in the water in the body could be replaced by oxygen-18, and if necessary Hydrogen could be replaced by deuterium. With bones strengthened and anchored, and density equalized as far as possible, the possibility exists that humans could endure very high accelerations in fluid immersion tanks, potentially on the order of hundreds of g. Blood would have to be artificially oxygenated and nutrients supplied intravenously, and the brain would have to be hooked up to a direct neural link VR rig in order to prevent psychological trauma from being locked inside an acceleration tank, as well as to control the ship, since having all bones anchored and immobilized would prevent manual control. Body modifications such as piercings or surgical implants like joint replacements, gastric bands and pacemakers would have to be removed or anchored along with the subject's bones - imagine the consequences of applying a 500g+ acceleration to an unanchored earring with a mass differential of several grams - a 5g gold earring might effectively weigh at least 2.3 kg under such conditions and cause quite a bit of damage. 

The effect on a species of having a caste or metamorphosis that cannot ever reproduce, while still being physically capable is that such individuals are - in an evolutionary sense - disposable. This can lead to them being the species' soldiers. Since reproduction for the soldiers is a non-issue, their deaths are not individually significant, and are only significant in terms of the advantage they give to their reproductive relatives. Thus, we have soldiers who are more inclined to sacrifice themselves if necessary to protect their younger reproductive relatives. Since the end-of-life phase of these metamorphosing creatures is to a non-reproductive form, it is quite likely that it would evolve to be as nasty a fighter as possible, since its only purpose is to protect - and educate - younger members of its species. Self-sacrifice in the name of defending the breeders would be relatively common. Humans would also appear to follow this pattern of reproductive behaviour to some extent. The presence of menopause could be considered a limited metamorphosis. It is hypothesised that menopause evolved in humans since giving birth was historically a risky activity (far more so than today), and any dependent children would be likely to die if the mother died. An older woman would probably have children who were no longer completely dependent, and increasing the probability of the woman's survival to a greater age by eliminating reproduction would allow her to concentrate on increasing the survivability of her earlier children and their children, by providing both physical aid and knowledge. This is known as the Grandmother Hypothesis. 

I have a world where the magic system is based pretty much on the Ars Magica RPG and a technological level roughly equivalent to 17th century Earth. Co-existing (in the same geographical areas but not typically the same settlements) with humans and human-like beings that are approximately the same size as normal humans are fairies - who are effectively humans who average 3" / 7.63cm tall and weigh on average 0.017lb/7.5g with a variety of insect-like and bird-like wings and the ability to fly about as well as the creature their wings resemble. Through magic, these fairies: 

Is it possible that a large, multicellular, naturally evolved organism with an advanced intellect on the order of a human's could have evolved to pass on its knowledge and memories in a fashion that could be described as 'genetic'? By 'genetic', I mean that a newly born/hatched/whatever organism would emerge with at least a reasonable subset of one or both/all of its parents' stock of knowledge at the time at which it was born or conceived (depending on the means of reproduction) without having to be taught in the manner that human children must be taught. Obviously, this should not preclude such offspring learning naturally in the manner with which we are familiar after birth. Should this be possible, by what mechanism might this take place? 

In this setting, laying aside magic for the moment, there are still some basic investigative techniques that may be used. These fall generally into the categories of human intelligence and forensics. Since even today, most murders are solved in the first two days after the crime, if necromancy has a minimum elapsed time restriction before it can be used, this may well be outside the first 48h, and so would be used only on the more difficult cases. Human Intelligence Human Intelligence is basically the matter of having the investigators interview the suspects and witnesses, either formally in an interview room, or informally wherever they may happen to meet. The techniques of interviewing suspects and witnesses has changed little for hundreds of years, and does not depend upon technology. Assuming that the investigators eschew torture for whatever reason, either that they recognise that confessions or information so obtained is unreliable, or simply that torture is illegal, a good investigator can still spot and pursue inconsistencies in a subject's dialogue, and determine who has good alibies or not. Forensics Forensics has also existed in some form for hundreds of years, though in a pre-industrial-revolution society, there would of course not be the many scientific tests that we have these days. Still, that leaves many options:
