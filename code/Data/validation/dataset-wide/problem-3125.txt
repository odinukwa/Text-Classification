The context is High Medieval, (c. 1001—1300). The concept of feudalism is as understood in Europe. I'm not looking for an answer to cover all European empires or dynasties during this period -- which would be too broad (too much work?). Answers can focus on a selected empire, such as, but not limited to - Angevin Empire, Holy Roman Empire, or even the Caliphate of Córdoba. This question is not about religion, it is focused on high medieval military command and power structure of European empires. Is the distribution of strong armies controlled by geography, relative strength of king vs court, or by some effectively random factor such as the personality of the ruler, or accidents of time? Or, an entirely consistent plan of medieval leadership, i.e.Kings, Emperor, Caliph? 

Naturally, the next question that follows is - can linguistics explain everything about a historical culture (Scythian, in this case)? How about archaeology? What of written histories by sedentary societies who interacted with the Scythians (Greek & Old Persian in this case)? If historical linguistics is so certain and absolute, why are we still having debates on the Indo-European languages? See this (Nature, 2015), this (GeoCurrents, 2012) and a forthcoming book (to be published December 2017, Cambridge University Press), The Indo-European Controversy: Facts and Fallacies in Historical Linguistics. I have an advanced copy of this book and I can tell you it tears into the Indo-European discussion very bluntly, in particular, the work of University of Auckland published here: "Mapping the Origins and Expansion of the Indo-European Language Family" (Science, 24 August, 2012 - Vol. 337, Issue 6097, pp. 957-96). I am not saying that linguistics is useless, but I am saying that one needs to be cautious with linguistic conclusions on historical matters. Hence, I stated specifically early on (above), that I do not want to go into details of linguistic classifications. 

One way to evaluate if the siege warfare of the Mongols were better is to look beyond the equipment engines. Ideally, it should include a detailed discussion of the following (and then do a comparison against the Western/Muslim armies): 

Park Chung-hee was a military dictator of South Korea in the 60s and 70s. He was assassinated. His daughter Park Geun-hye, who at one point was acting First Lady of South Korea, was democratically elected president in February 2013. 

Not all Japanese-Americans were interned - Japanese-Americans in Hawaii weren't interned. However, for areas where the US were systematically interning all Japanese-Americans, how effective were the US at identifying and detaining them? I know that some tried to avoid it, such as Fred Korematsu, but don't know any statistics. 

In this anti-Asian 1907 NZ cartoon, is the person being entangled by the octopus in this cartoon meant to be Maori? The clothing and long hair suggest it's not a white New Zealander (pakeha), but I assume that more likely than not, people with an anti-Asian prejudice from that time would regard Maoris as inferior to whites. Should I interpret the figure as a metaphorical representation of NZ, one that'd be used even by people who'd be prejudiced against Maoris? 

As far as I'm aware, in Australia, currently only countries which are predominantly made up of people not of European descent, such as China, are seen as a "threat" to Australia's manufacturing. Have majority European descent countries ever viewed other majority European descent countries as a threat to their manufacturing? I'm interested in both examples where the other country is seen as "inferior" (whether racially, religiously, or culturally), and where the other country is not seen as "inferior". 

However, when this was happening, large-scale, systematic killing on racial or religious lines also was happening. I'm not sure if this answers the question, because I assume the question asker is mainly interested in attempts at eliminating a race without large-scale killing being done. 

Did French ever have any special status in Austria or the Austrian empire, akin to it being the language of royalty in England (and possibly Russia, I'm not sure) (as opposed to it being just another foreign language)? 

It started in 1256, before Edward I started his reign in 1272 and was finally achieved nearly 30 years later, when he was King of England. The resurgence of the Gwynedd, led by Llywelyn ap Gruffudd (Llywelyn II, grandson of Llywelyn the Great) in late 1256 was in fact caused by Edward's own visit to Wales earlier in the year, when the king's chief steward, Geoffrey de Langley, ".. boasted before the king and queen that he had all the Welsh in his grip" The effect of this boast was a rebellion, and with help from Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, was a full-scale military incursion into English lands as well that of Marcher lords. In addition, Edward's own castles at Dyserth & Deganwy were besieged (newly built by his father, Henry III, but given to Edward as endowment for his marriage to Eleanor of Castile). This is important because it was not Henry III's fight -- most of the lands in Wales held by Henry were already bestowed to Edward. 

Viet Minh and Ho Chi Minh Do not forget the origin of the Viet Minh, it was anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist, not anti-Viet. In 1976, Saigon (in South Vietnam) changed its name to Ho Chi Minh City. And who was Ho Chi Minh? The founder/creator of Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam). Liberation All of Vietnam celebrates Reunification Day (aka as Liberation Day), after they kicked out the US Army from Saigon. The answer to your question(s) should be obvious if you think about these simple but crucial points for a moment without reference to accepted wisdom (whatever that means). In short, the question does not really make any sense from a Viet perspective. 

Things only started to go wrong only about a year later, with the abolition of the French nobility by the newly constituted National Assembly, on 19th June 1790, which caused the mass emigration of the nobility (mainly to Germany). Even after this decree, nobles were considered free citizens, and to do as they wish (i.e. even the Reign of Terror was more chaotic than specifically directed at nobility). 

News that Saudi Arabia will allow women to drive has been in the news recently. It's been described as the only country that currently forbids women from driving, which makes me wonder about whether other countries recently forbade women from driving. I thought I once heard that during the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq, Kuwaiti women took advantage of the regime change by going driving, which the Kuwaiti government forbade. However, I couldn't find any evidence of this online, including looking at Women in Kuwait or Women's suffrage in Kuwait, though mentions of women driving is mentioned here ("can women drive in Kuwait") and here ("Kuwaiti men should know that human rights goes far beyond 'being allowed to drive', 'dressing as they like' and being 'allowed to acquire education'.") Was this the case? Were women banned from driving in Kuwait prior to its invasion in 1990? 

Some nationalities (for example New Zealand and Wales) are the butt of jokes about bestiality, especially with sheep. What lead to this? 

When seeing some documentary about the history of medical science in the middle ages, I got the impression that many doctors were happy to merely study the works of Galen, rather than do their own research, and that that was detrimental in the long run to medical science. Was this the case? Were there any other cases where books from classical times were detrimental to either the knowledge held in the middle ages, or to the rate of acquiring new knowledge? For the purposes of this question, don't regard religious texts (for example, the Bible) as delaying scientific progress. 

The section "Former Yugoslavia" of the Wikipedia article on War rape says that Serbs raped Muslims and Croatians with the intention to produce new Serbs 

In December 1967, then-serving prime minister of Australia, Harold Holt, disappeared while swimming at Cheviot Beach, Victoria. His body was never found, though an inquest held much later stated that the cause of death was drowning. Has such an occurrence happened in recent history, defined by being recent enough to have rapid communication such as the telegram and widespread recognition of what the individual looked like such as photography, to either a serving head of government, or a serving head of state, for any other country? I had a quick skim over List of people who disappeared mysteriously and "Real Life" in Never Found the Body in TV Tropes (warning: not productivity safe) and didn't find any other examples.

Concept of Barter In the context of this question, bartering is seen as an accepted form of exchange for goods and services without the use of fiat money. To this end, it is a natural choice if money was not available (not yet invented, for instance). Unfortunately, on a deeper level of analysis, this is not true. 

Yes, there were -- and vice versa. There were European (Christian knights) operating as mercenaries for Muslim rulers as well as Muslim knights/mercenaries in Christian courts. 

Finally, as Wikipedia entry of this battle states, the date of this battle can be different from the one you've provided (1457 BC). This battle given by Cline is dated 1479 BC. 

From your comments, "What I was getting out of the social contract was that the government is ruled by the will of the governed/people. Even in an empire, because if you're not governing well you will get overthrown" is, in the broadest sense, a correct interpretation of Rousseau's Social Contract (1762). The trick here is to ask, what exactly do we mean when we say, "governing well"? Should governments grant the wish of every individual citizen? Is this even feasible? If not every individual's personal wish, perhaps the government should at least follow the will of the majority? Which leads to, what if the majority of the populace wants to eradicate a certain ethnic group or maybe people with specific disability, should the government actually do this? These are ethical and moral considerations, which, fortunately (for me at the very least), we should not get into with this answer because these are questions of political philosophy. 

In explaining how a completely preserved camel skeleton uncovered at the River Danube in Tulln, Austria, The Smithsonian (in 2015) concluded that it was probably exchanged or left behind from the 1683 Battle of Vienna by the Turks. The important point is the archaeologists were surprised at the discovery of camel remains. We can, therefore, surmise that camels were not used in the battle, i.e. there was no known camel cavalry in Battle of Vienna, 1683.
