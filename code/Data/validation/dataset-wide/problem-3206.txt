There were attempts to convert Armenians and Georgians too. While The persecution and virtually complete annihilation of Sunni Muslims in Iran by Safavid Empire is well known and undisputed even by Modern Iranian historians, the treatment of non-Muslim minorities requires deeper discussion. Reasons behind Ismaili Conversion Campaign First of all, we have to understand why did Ismail I undertake religious conversion of Iran. Following are the reasons cited by historical sources: 

The answer is a very solid yes although I'd prefer the word Intervene rather than invade. India was one of the key possessions of British and Indian trade was crucial to British economy at that time. As long as British economy was strong, Britain would have been able to field expeditionary forces to thwart French ambitions worldwide. So that's where comes the Bold plan to hit the British where it would really hurt: India. One of the Key goals of Napoleon's invasion of Egypt was to link up with his Indian allies and help them in liberating their homeland against the British. This would not only damage the British economy but also win friendship and trade concessions for the French in Indian subcontinent. According to Napoleon and Persia by Irdaj Amini: 

Just like Scientific method exists to prove or disprove scientific theories and hypothesis, Historical Method also exists. Historians of course cross-check certain claims with contemporary sources including archaeological evidence and thus proceed to create their account of the concerned historic event. 

Note the tribal leaders, many of them are founders of important tribes such as Banu-Kalb, Banu Juhainah, Banu Aslam, Banu Tayy, Banu Aus, Banu Khazraj etc. The Adnanites were called "Arab-e-Mustarba / عرب مستعربة" or "Arabized Arabs". They are the ones who are supposed to have been descended from Ishmael, son of Abraham through Ishmael's descendant Adnan and had adopted the Arab identity and culture. As Abraham was founder of Hebrews and Hagar was Egyptian, that would make the Adnanites to be Hebrew or Hebrew-Egyptian in actual descent as per the legend. But since they adopted Arab identity and culture, they became "Arabized Arabs". Pictured below, a tree of Prophet Muhammad's descent from Adnan: 

So which regions do these flags represent? Or did the artist just made them up in his head? P.S. Pardon me if I am mistaking between red and green color here. 

The aborigines are believed to have migrated from India in prehistoric times. The Maoris are thought to have arrived from Polynesia and elsewhere in eastern Asia. They travelled by canoe. It's one and a half thousand miles from NZ to OZ, about the same as the distance between Britain and Greenland. That's a long way, but NZ is even further away from the islands that the Polynesians travelled from. Did they ever visit Australia and meet its people? 

I suppose you could argue it's not uber-important what they thought about a war on another continent in which they had no direct stake, but all the other countries in Latin America couldn't afford to ignore it completely. See American Hemispheric Perspectives on the Spanish Civil War Vargas was in favour of the Allies during the Second World War, and wasn't particularly troubled by a distant USSR. But did he follow Salazar in supporting the rebels, or just do nothing at all? 

It's arguably Pius VII who crowned Napoleon I, but given the rather dodgy legality there (he put the crown on his own head) I'm going to suggest a different answer. In 1530, Clement VII crowned Charles V the Emperor of the Germans, more correctly and misleadingly known as the Holy Roman Emperor. After that, all emperors stayed emperors-elect. 

In David Leip's political atlas, it says that 'Communist' gained 32 votes in the 1876 presidential election. The name of the candidates and the state where these votes were counted doesn't appear. Of course 32 votes isn't many, but I'm surprised even the word was in use back then. Is this website kosher? 

If we're talking about the Kuomintang, then what's known as the Nanking Decade was when they held maximum power. In the very early republic Yuan Shikai controlled more territory, but not for long as his inability to stop the exploitation of China by foreign powers and his general conservatism made him very unpopular. Source: China in war and revolution, by Peter Zarrow. Also, neither the Beiyang government nor the Kuomintang could rule anything in the same way that Mao did. Chiang was more like a mediaeval European king, who got the allegiance of warlords, by being the strongest warlord around. 

Armenia and Azerbaijan fought a mutually bloody war between 1988 and 1994. The Azerbaijan government (specifically, its embassy in Latvia, of all places) said that the Armenians caused all the following damage. It seems likely to be exaggerated, but by how much? $URL$ 

The country was divided into counties and boroughs. To vote for county MPs (usually two per county) a man had to own freehold property worth forty shillings per year. This means that it could be let for that amount. Whether it was, in fact, let was irrelevant. Most boroughs also returned two members. The qualification for voting varied from borough to borough. The most democratic were known as "pot walloper" boroughs. In these any man who was able to boil a pot in the town, that is anyone who had his own hearth, was entitled to vote. In such boroughs the form of tenure was irrelevant. Some boroughs used the "scot and lot" system. This meant that only those who paid certain church and poor relief taxes could vote. The obligation to pay these taxes was often linked to membership of merchant guilds, which in turn gave people the right to trade or carry on certain occupations within the town. In effect, those with the right to traded or do business in the town were able to vote. In some boroughs the "burgage" system was used. This meant that anyone who held property in the town on a yearly rental, either directly from the king or from a specified local lord (depending on the borough), was entitled to vote. The holder of such property might or might not personally reside there. The property could be sublet, and the right to vote might be let with it, let separately, or retained. The least democratic were boroughs where the "corporation" method was used. In these boroughs the right to vote was held by members of the corporation, which in many cases was self-perpetuating, with new members being appointed by existing ones. In many cases the corporation was responsible for aspects of the town's administration, but in some there was no town, merely a self-perpetuating group with the right to elect two MPs - these included the Rotten boroughs. Another system involved "freemen" of a town having the right to vote. In some cases freedom of a town was inherited, or granted automatically to apprentices, and/or at the discretion of the corporation. There were instances of large numbers of new freemen being created just in time for elections. In many cases a man otherwise qualified to vote could not do so if he was in receipt of poor relief. Generally, only adult male Protestant British subjects could vote. Not everyone who had the right to vote had the opportunity, at least not often. Very many MPs were returned unopposed. Nobody might choose to stand against the nominee of the major landowner. In other areas once an MP was elected to one Parliament, if he wished to continue he might be elected unopposed to successive parliaments until he chose to retire, or gave cause for significant dissatisfaction. Local convention could be important, for example Lancashire county traditionally elected one member of the Stanley family, and one other. Where elections were contested they could be the cause of very great excitement. To vote people had to attend the county town in person and might at the very least expect to be reimbursed their expenses by whichever candidate they voted for. Strictly speaking, Birmingham and Manchester were represented as part of Warwickshire and Lancashire respectively, and in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century Warwickshire conventionally sent one MP from Birmingham and one other. Lancashire sent two county members and two each from Liverpool, Lancaster, Preston and Wigan, but none specifically from Manchester. This paper, from the House of Commons library, goes into more detail. As Steve Bird has stated around 3% of the population could vote, which if we exclude women and boys is perhaps close to 10% of the adult male population. The proportion fell somewhat during the eighteenth and early nineteenth century as the general population increased faster than the voting population. 

In the final analysis, Abbas II seems to have decided that the attempt to convert the Jews was not worth the effort; he realized that they only became Shias for outward show and because they were forced to do so, and so he allowed them to return to their own religion and live as they thought fit. A number of Western historians have given Abbas II a favorable report card in regard to his treatment of the Christian minorities in his realm. For example, Sir John Malcolm, in his History of Persia, says: 

Muslim trader presence certainly existed in the Byzantine Empire. I'd split my answer into three parts: Documented Facts: Quoting from the main source: Muslim presence in the Eastern Roman Empire can be traced back to very foundation of Islam in the 7th century but at some later point the Muslims were regarded as a quasi community and appropriate institutions emerged, probably in the context of some treaties that had temporarily suspended the constant confrontation between the armies of the Byzantine Empire and the Caliphate. Among the provisions for the comfort of the Muslims in the Byzantine capital, the foundation and operation of a mosque for the practicing of the Muslims seems to be most characteristic. The earliest information on the existence of a mosque dates to the early 10th century and can be collected from letters of patriarch Nikolas Mystikos to the Abbasid caliph Al-Muqtadir of Baghdad, which date more precisely in the period of the patriarch's regency, after the death of the emperor Alexandros (913) until the enthronement of Romanos I Lekapenos (920). (Jenkins, R.J.H.- Westerink, L.G. (eds.), Nicholas I. Letters (Washington DC 1973), no. 102.) (The mosque was probably built for Arab prisoners of war captured by Byzantines) This correspondence, where the mention to the mosque of Constantinople is to be found, took place on the occasion of the closure of Christian churches within the Abbasid territory, which we are informed that was due to rumors circulating in the Abbasid capital, concerning the alleged closure of the mosque in Constantinople. The patriarch denied these rumors, and at the same time he protested for the closure of the Christian churches. The date of the composition of these letters constitutes a terminus ante quem for the foundation of the mosque of Constantinople, which however cannot be determined more precisely. Another letter by Nikolas Mystikos to Caliph of Baghdad is described in Muslim perception of other religions by Professor Jacques Waardenburg which shows attempts in forging peace between the two constantly at-war neighbors: 

Italy won just one major battle without Germany's help: the conquest of Somaliland. Everywhere else, the Italians were beaten by the British... and sometimes even without British help. The Greek forces pushed them back into Albania, they were fought to a standstill in Yugoslavia. The British forces defeated them in North Africa. In every case, this created a humongous risk for the Germans, who couldn't afford to let the British get a toehold on the continent. So the Germans, expending personnel and materiel, had to bail out the Italians every time. So yes, the Italians inadvertantly helped the Allies. 

During the Second World War, did the Arabs of North Africa care at all that the Germans were invading their countries, or did they think that there was no difference between the Germans and France and Britain? 

Not sure if this goes here, but I couldn't work see a literature stack exchange... In the Sherlock Holmes story A Study in Scarlet, I have always wondered about the following passage: '"I have my old service revolver and a few cartridges." "You had better clean it and load it. He will be a desperate man, and though I shall take him unawares, it is as well to be ready for anything." I went to my bedroom and followed his advice. When I returned with the pistol the table had been cleared, and Holmes was engaged in his favourite occupation of scraping upon his violin. "The plot thickens," he said, as I entered; "I have just had an answer to my American telegram. My view of the case is the correct one." "And that is?" I asked eagerly. "My fiddle would be the better for new strings," he remarked. "Put your pistol in your pocket. When the fellow comes speak to him in an ordinary way. Leave the rest to me. Don't frighten him by looking at him too hard." "It is eight o'clock now," I said, glancing at my watch. "Yes. He will probably be here in a few minutes. Open the door slightly. That will do. Now put the key on the inside. Thank you! This is a queer old book I picked up at a stall yesterday—'De Jure inter Gentes'—published in Latin at Liege in the Lowlands, in 1642. Charles' head was still firm on his shoulders when this little brown-backed volume was struck off." "Who is the printer?" "Philippe de Croy, whoever he may have been. On the fly-leaf, in very faded ink, is written 'Ex libris Guliolmi Whyte.' I wonder who William Whyte was. Some pragmatical seventeenth century lawyer, I suppose. His writing has a legal twist about it. Here comes our man, I think."' Were Philippe de Croy or William Whyte connected to any of the historical people with those names? $URL$ $URL$ If your answer is, 'no, he made them up' I will be happy to upvote it... if it has sources :). I googled around it, but it's hard because it's a famous public domain book and you mostly get that passage reflected back at you.
