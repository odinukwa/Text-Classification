No. The dharma is about returning to your buddha mind or original mind unaltered. The use of mind altering drugs goes directly against the return to the unaltered mind literally by definition. I would venture to say that Mind Altering things (ie. TV/EGO/DRUGS/External Attachments) are what the middle way and the dharma are trying to be free from. 

"I've a feeling that the way we are asking about precepts in these questions might not be from a Mahayana perspective" I am a Zen practitioner and I agree that i find many of the other questions you mentioned to be meaningless. To me as a Zen practitioner those questions are all about labels and the dharma is more about letting go and freeing oneself from these labels. I have actually started frequenting these boards less because in my perspective I feel that many of the questions asked skirt around the dharma or at least focus in on the labels and names that have attached itself to the dharma over the years. I do know however that this is merely my perspective as a Zen practitioner and many people might disagree with me. 

I was always under the impression that happiness was our default setting, our buddha nature. If we remove "blow away or extinguish" all the labels, bindings, and habit energies that collect what is left is happiness. True Happiness is the default state we experience when we extinguish the fires that cause suffering. This cessation of suffering can also be described as complete peace. It is a great wealth because it is the only thing that can bring us true liberation. 

Everything is impermanent, even one's nature. If you look at the span of your life, your year, your month, or even a single day in your life you will see that your nature is in a constant state of change. 

From my understanding of Buddhism, there are no memories from beyond. Everything including memories are impermanent. There is no permanent memory-self that remains from moment to moment. 

In Zen we are not taught to abandon things. Instead we are taught to let go of our attachment to things. The key here is that it is not the things themselves that make us suffer, but it is our attachment to these things that make us suffer. Eliminating the things themselves is different than learning to liberate yourself from your own attachment to these things. Three men sit in a lions den waiting to be eaten by a hungry lion. The first man hides in the corner trembling in fear of the lion. The second man stands strong ready to face the lion and kill it. The third man is liberated from attachments and is not in fear of the lion, nor does he want to kill the lion. In the present moment the third man is filled with joy and happiness for he is alive. Abandoning things, is like the man trying to get rid of the lion. At first it may seem like the best choice, but there is a middle way between the first two men. 

The Buddha taught the Middle Way. The Middle Way is free of the concepts of "free will" and "determinism". Both are true. Both are untrue. And yes it is confusing, but when one walks down the path of the Middle Way one has to leave their ideas and attachments of labels like "free will" behind. This is highly stressed in Zen. Zen practitioners use koans to help them transcend the unease and confusion of nonattachment to labels and ideas. "What is the sound of one hand clapping?" is one of the most widely known koan. Either way, being confused is a great state to be at. I am studying equanimity (upeksha) right now. My zen teacher calls equanimity "letting go". Upeksha means equanimity, nonattachment, nondiscrimination,even-mindedness, or letting go. Upa means "over,"and iksh means "to look." You climb the mountain to be able to look over the whole situation, not bound by one side or the other. 

Yes you can. Forgetfulness is very common. Everyday I lose/forget jhana throughout the day and everyday I have to wake up and remember again. It is a daily, moment to moment practice to remember the jhana. Here is a story from Zen Flesh, Zen Bones. 

As a zen buddhist in Florida of the United States, taking refuge in the three jewels is the ceremony in which one will often consider themselves becoming buddhist. Taking on the precepts can be seen as the threshold one makes to become a Buddhist. Afterwards one often gets a "Dharma name" and formally calls themselves a Buddhist Practitioner. Of course this is all merely ceremonial but the point of taking on a title is very tied to ceremonies. I graduated college with a ceremony. I grew another year with a ceremony. I became a man with a ceremony. Ceromonies help define ourselves to ourselves and to others. However in my personal experience one becomes a Buddhist when they join a sangha. It is in a sangha where I feel the practice really comes alive in my life. 

I do not recall any teaching where the Buddha is said to know what is inside a black hole. In fact Buddha specifically states not to spend time with contemplating the heavens. The Buddha focused his attention on the present moment, which rarely includes black holes. 

Try asking yourself the following. Does your home cause others to suffer? Does your bed cause more suffering to others than it needs to? Try to have a home, bed, and chairs that reduce the amount of suffering in the world. I would look at the question, why does this precept exist? Because beds, chairs, and homes cause suffering. This precept exists to help us be mindful of the suffering of others and to take steps to lessen that suffering even in our beds, chairs, and homes. 

As a Floridian Zen Buddhist, it is not the Buddhism that I would be concerned with. I would be more mindful of Nepal culture and cultural and language differences. Buddhism is buddhism really wherever you go, but cultural practices and cultural identity varies. Or in other words, Buddhism morphs and adapts to the culture and environment it is in. I do not know anything about Nepal, but perhaps googling Nepal culture or Nepal culture in America might be more beneficial than just Buddhism as a whole. 

Gratitude is a Buddhist concept. Below is an essay on Gratitude in Buddhism by Thanissaro Bhikkhu Anguttara Nikaya The Further-factored Discourses 

I am not a well practiced zen buddhist but just a practitioner of zen buddhism. I do not know the answer but I do know where I would look for this answer. If I were tasked with finding the above I would look in the Diamond Sutra. 

"All authentic practices of the Buddha carry within them three essential teachings called the Dharma Seals. These three teachings of the Buddha are: impermanence, no self and nirvana. Just as all-important legal documents have the mark or signature of a witness, all genuine practices of the Buddha bear the mark of these three teachings." -Thich Nhat Hanh $URL$
