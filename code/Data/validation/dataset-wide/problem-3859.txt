This is basically a reference request. Does anyone know if the structure of the homotopy category of spectra (or maybe just the model, i.e. w/o the homotopy, category), localized at infinite wedges of Morava K-theories, or BP, is either well described somewhere or somehow stupid and uninteresting? This question is motivated by i) I believe Morava K-theories and the telescope spectra T(n) are the same BP-locally, i.e. a sort of telescope conjecture, and ii) wondering if localizing at BP or maybe the wedge of all the Morava K-theories would somehow pick out all the chromatic information in the category of spectra. That is (and I think my details will be off because I haven't thought about this in a little bit), there is some idea in the derived category of a Noetherian ring that we have these localization functors which correspond to prime ideals of the ring, and that maybe localizing at BP is somehow localizing the stable homotopy category at the $I_n$ ideals or something. Any commentary is appreciated. Thanks! 

When is it the case that $X/Y$ is again an $n$-fold loop space? Are there weaker conditions that guarantee $X/Y$ is an $m$-fold loop space for some $0<m<n$? As a topological space, $X/Y$ satisfies a universal condition up to homotopy. In particular, it induces a morphism $X/Y\to Z$ whenever there is a morphism $X\to Z$ such that the composition $Y\to X\to Z$ is null. When is it true that this induced morphism is again a morphism of $n$- or $m$-fold loop spaces, assuming $X/Y$ is? 

I have been informed that there is a reference out there which specifically details what goes wrong with the mod 2 Moore spectrum, i.e. why it is not $A_\infty$ or something? I do not know the details, but I am interested in this from the point of view of trying to understand how to come up with the correct notion of ideals of spectra (in the sense of Smith and others), especially the ideal generated by multiplication by 2 on the sphere spectrum. I think it is a paper by Neeman. Does anyone know of this paper, or of other papers which might detail this situation carefully? Thanks! PS Is this question appropriate, as it is only a reference request, in the strongest sense of the phrase? 

It is said, as far as I can tell that an arbitrary spectral space, i.e. a space that is $T_0$, sober and quasi-compact whose collection of quasi-compact open sets forms a basis and is closed under finite intersections, must be $Spec(R)$ for some ring $R$. Is there a canonical (or any) way of reconstructing $R$ from its collection of prime ideals and the Zariski topology thereupon? What is the relationship of the functor $Spec:Rng\to SpectralSpaces$ and the functor (if it exists) going the other way $SpectralSpaces\to Rng$? Thanks! 

There is a well understood bifibration of $\infty$-categories over the $\infty$-category of commutative ring spectra whose fiber over a ring $R$ is the category of $R$-module spectra. This is in analogy to the usual Grothendieck fibration over commutative rings in discrete algebra. One then can ask which morphisms of commutative ring spectra are of effective descent for modules. In other words, one can ask whether or not the category of $R$-modules is equivalent to the category of descent data for some morphism $R\to S$ (which is constructed as as the homotopical totalization of the Amitsur complex). Rognes has introduced a notion of faithful morphism of ring spectra which is the following: if $\phi:R\to S$ is a morphism of ring spectra, then it is faithful if for every $R$-module $M$, $M\wedge_RS\simeq \ast$ implies that $M\simeq\ast$. Lurie has also introduced a notion of faithfully flat: the morphism $\phi$ is faithfully flat if $\pi_0(\phi):\pi_0R\to\pi_0S$ is faithfully flat and $\pi_iS\cong \pi_iR\otimes_{\pi_0R}\pi_0 S$. Are either of these sufficient to imply effective decent for modules? What if we say that morphism is faithful in the sense of Rognes but also a Galois extension for some stably dualizable group $G$ or even a Hopf-Galois extension? Is there a classification of effective descent morphisms in this setting? Thanks! 

Taking the point of view that a Thom spectrum functor should be a map $Top_{/BGL_1(R)}\to LMod_R$, for $R$ some $\mathbb{E}_n$-ring spectrum, there seem to be two morphisms (in $Top_{/BGL_1(R)}$) that could potentially be called the "Thom diagonal." The first (given as diagram 5.43 on page 42 of ABGHR) is given by the commutative triangle (hence the morphism in $Top_{/BGL_1(R)}$): $$\require{AMScd} \begin{CD} X@>{\Delta}>> X\times X;\\ @V{f}VV @VVf\circ\pi_1V \\ BGL_1(R)@>{=}>> BGL_1(R); \end{CD}$$ and the second (given on page 37 of this other paper by Ando, Blumberg and Gepner) is given in $GL_1(R)$-spaces (equivalent to spaces over $BGL_1(R)$): $$P\overset{1_P\times \ast}\longrightarrow P\times (GL_1(R)\times X).$$ These seem like different morphisms (i.e. if we use the Grothendieck construction to compare them), are they? My motivation for thinking the latter is not the same as the former is that the latter is equivalent to a morphism that would factor as $$P\overset{1_P\times \ast}\longrightarrow P\times GL_1(R)\overset{1_{P\times GL_1(R)}\times\ast}\longrightarrow P\times (GL_1(R)\times X),$$ but this, on the level of spaces over $BGL_1(R)$, should correspond not to the diagonal map but rather the inclusion into the left coordinate $X\overset{i_1}\hookrightarrow X\times X$ (I think?!). If this latter map is NOT the one coming from the former, then what map in $GL_1(R)$-spaces does come from the former map? If the latter map is the same as the former, how do we see that? 

In ABGHR Thom spectra are described in the following way: we start with a morphism of Kan complexes $X\to \mathbb{S}\text{-line}$, where $\mathbb{S}\text{-line}$ is an $\infty$-groupoid which is equivalent to the well known $BGL_1(\mathbb{S})$. Then the Thom spectrum $Mf$ is defined to be the colimit of the composition of functors (of $\infty$-categories) $X\to\mathbb{S}\text{-line}\to\mathbb{S}Mod$. If we have a commutative ring spectrum $R$ there is a functor $\mathbb{S}\text{-line}\to R\text{-line}$ and it is a theorem that the colimit of the composition $X\to\mathbb{S}\text{-line}\to R\text{-line}\to RMod$ is equivalent to $Mf\wedge R$. There is a fibration of $\infty$-groupoids $R\text{-triv}\to R\text{-line}$ that we should think of as being our model of $EGL_1(R)\to BGL_1(R)$. If the composition $X\to R\text{-line}$ lifts to $R\text{-triv}$ then we say that $Mf$ is $R$-oriented and we have a Thom isomorphism $Mf\wedge R\simeq X_+\wedge R$. My question is the following: we know classically that $Mf\wedge Mf\simeq X_+\wedge Mf $ (perhaps there are some conditions I need to put on $f$ to make this true?). So, if we assume $X$ is an infinite loop space and $X\to \mathbb{S}\text{-line}$ is a morphism of infinite loop spaces then we should have that $X\to\mathbb{S}\text{-line}\to Mf\text{-line}$ lifts to $Mf\text{-triv}$, yielding the classical Thom isomorphism described above. Is there an easy way to see that there is such a lift in this framework? A more general question is: we know that such lifts always give such Thom isomorphisms, but are there conditions under which we can deduce a lift from such an isomorphism? 

Given an algebraic ring, how is its derived category related to the homotopy category of HR modules? Thanks. This is essentially a reference request, since I know there may be a lot (or nothing) to say about this. 

In the proof of the Nilpotence Theorem, or at least in Ravenel's account of it in his Orange Book, a sequence of spectra are used, denoted $X(n)$ with $X(0)=\mathbb{S}$ and and $X(\infty)=MU$ such that $\langle X(n)\rangle\geq\langle X(n+1)\rangle$. These are the Thom spectra associated to the map $\Omega SU(n)\to BU$. They are homotopy equivalent to $MU$ up through degree 2n-1. They all have associated Hurewicz maps $h(n):\pi_\ast(R)\to X(n)_\ast(R)$ for $R$ a finite ring spectra. We are interested, for the Nilpotence Theorem, in determining when $h(n)(\alpha)=0$, ultimately for $n=0$. To this end, Ravenel proves that if $h(n+1)(\alpha)=0$ then $h(n)(\alpha)$ is nilpotent. So, from this theorem we know then that any of the $X(n)$ spectra detect nilpotence just as well as $MU$. The nice thing of course about $MU$ (or one of the many nice things) is that it has at least one other interpretation (i.e. aside from its geometric interpretation as a Thom spectrum). This is of course that $MU_\ast$ determines formal group laws over rings, and you have all of this amazing stuff happen. Do you have any similar such interpretations for these $X(n)$ spectra, or are they ONLY geometric in nature? Or I guess, to rephrase, does anyone KNOW of any other ways of thinking about these things? Thanks!
