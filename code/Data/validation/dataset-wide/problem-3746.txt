Here are two examples similar to Ben's answer, followed by an example with a path-connected space. Let $[X,Y]$ denote the naive pointed homotopy classes of pointed maps. We're comparing the (say, unreduced) singular cohomology functor $H^n(X;G)$ to the naively represented functor $[X_+, K(G,n)]$. As Chris pointed out, singular cohomology is representable in the derived sense, i.e., agrees with its value on a CW approximation of $X$. Example 1. Let $T \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ be the topologist's sine curve $$T = \{ (x, \sin \frac{1}{x}) \mid x \in (0,1] \} \cup \{(0,0)\}.$$ Its zeroth singular cohomology is the finite product $$H^0(T;\mathbb{Z}) = \mathrm{Hom}_{\mathbb{Z}}(H_0(T;\mathbb{Z}), \mathbb{Z}) = \mathrm{Set}(\pi_0(T),\mathbb{Z}) = \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}.$$ Its zeroth naive cohomology is $$[T_+, K(\mathbb{Z},0)] = \mathrm{Set}(\ast,\mathbb{Z}) = \mathbb{Z}.$$ A CW approximation $S^0 \stackrel{\sim}{\to} T$ induces on zeroth naive cohomology the diagonal inclusion $\mathbb{Z} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}$. Example 2. Let $X \subset \mathbb{R}$ be $$X = \{ \frac{1}{n} \mid n \in \mathbb{N} \} \cup \{0\}.$$ Let me name the points $x_n = \frac{1}{n}$ and $x_{\infty} = 0$ for convenience. The zeroth singular cohomology is the countable product $$H^0(X;\mathbb{Z}) = \mathrm{Set}(\pi_0(X),\mathbb{Z}) = \prod_{n \in \mathbb{N} \cup \{\infty\}} \mathbb{Z}.$$ The zeroth naive cohomology is the subgroup $$[X_+, K(\mathbb{Z},0)] = \{ (a_n) \in \prod_{n \in \mathbb{N} \cup \{\infty\}} \mathbb{Z} \mid (a_n) \text{ is eventually constant}\},$$ which happens to be a free abelian group on countably many generators. A CW approximation from the discrete space $\coprod_{x \in X} \{x\} = \mathbb{N} \cup \{\infty\} \stackrel{\sim}{\to} X$ induces on zeroth naive cohomology the inclusion of said subgroup. Example 3. Let $E = \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} C_n$ be the Hawaiian earring, where $C_n \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ denotes the circle of radius $\frac{1}{n}$ centered at $(\frac{1}{n},0)$. There is a surjective map $H_1(E; \mathbb{Z}) \twoheadrightarrow \prod_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \mathbb{Z}$; see for instance Hatcher Example 1.25 or [1]. Dualization into $\mathbb{Q}$ yields an injective map $$\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathbb{Z}}(\prod_{i \in \mathbb{N}} \mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Q}) \hookrightarrow \mathrm{Hom}_{\mathbb{Z}}(H_1(E; \mathbb{Z}), \mathbb{Q}) = H^1(E; \mathbb{Q}),$$ which shows that the first singular cohomology $H^1(E; \mathbb{Q})$ has uncountable dimension as a vector space over $\mathbb{Q}$. Indeed, the vector space $$\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathbb{Z}}(\prod_{i \in \mathbb{N}} \mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Q}) = \mathrm{Hom}_{\mathbb{Q}}(\mathbb{Q} \otimes_{\mathbb{Z}} (\prod_{i \in \mathbb{N}} \mathbb{Z}), \mathbb{Q})$$ has uncountable dimension since $\mathbb{Q} \otimes_{\mathbb{Z}} (\prod_{i \in \mathbb{N}} \mathbb{Z})$ does. Now denote $W_n = \bigcup_{i=1}^n C_i \cong \bigvee_{i=1}^n S^1$ and consider the retraction $E \to W_n$ that collapses all the circles $C_i$ with $i>n$ to the basepoint. Take a CW complex $K(\mathbb{Q},1)$. Any (pointed) map $E \to K(\mathbb{Q},1)$ is (pointed) homotopic to a map which factors as $E \to W_n \to K(\mathbb{Q},1)$ for $n$ large enough. This shows that the map $$\bigoplus_{i \in \mathbb{N}} \mathbb{Q} = \operatorname{colim}_n [W_n, K(\mathbb{Q},1)] \twoheadrightarrow [E,K(\mathbb{Q},1)]$$ is surjective, and thus the naive cohomology group $[E,K(\mathbb{Q},1)]$ is countable. In particular, a CW approximation $X' \stackrel{\sim}{\to} X$ induces a non-surjective map on naive cohomology $[E,K(\mathbb{Q},1)] \to H^1(E;\mathbb{Q})$. Edit. For the record, I previously thought that a similar argument would work with integral cohomology $H^1(E;\mathbb{Z})$, but I had forgotten Specker's theorem $\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathbb{Z}}(\prod_{i \in \mathbb{N}} \mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Z}) \cong \bigoplus_{i \in \mathbb{N}} \mathbb{Z}$. In fact, it turns out that said cohomology group is $H^1(E;\mathbb{Z}) \cong \bigoplus_{i \in \mathbb{N}} \mathbb{Z}$, as explained here.

Take the Binary value as an eight bit string. The number of Rotate left operations it takes to get the left most bit as zero is the permutation number( starting from 0) This is the shortest way to get the permutation number. Let me explain if the no is.......................11011111 

Test : "A True Random Sequence Source and a computer producing a certain sequence of numbers are kept in separate rooms and judges try to tell them apart by conducting a series of tests on the digits being sent to them from each room." " If the judges cannot reliably tell the computer from the Random sequence Source, the Computer is said to have passed the random generation test" 

With apologies to the Turing test....my question is Q Is the above test valid for determining the randomness of an infinite sequence? 

Hope that takes care of the downvote Alternatively do a bit wise not operation on the byte So not(11011111 ) -> 00100000 = M; L= Log2(M) ; permutation no = 7-L with startpoint 0 or 7-L+1 with startpoint 1(as is your scheme) Formula: whatPermutation(n)= 8-LogBase2(Bitwise_not(n)) where n is as described by you 

I apologize that this is vague, but I'm trying to understand a little bit of the historical context in which the zoo of quantum invariants emerged. For some reason, I have in my head the folklore: The discovery in the 80s by Jones of his new knot polynomial was a shock because people thought that the Alexander polynomial was the only knot invariant of its kind (involving a skein relation, taking values in a polynomial ring, ??). Before Jones, there were independent discoveries of invariants that each boiled down to the Alexander polynomial, possibly after some normalization. Is there any truth to this? Where is this written? 

Since, $b$ commutes with the bar involution, this basis is bar invariant as well. Explicitly, $C_w = T_w + \sum_{x < w} (-1)^{\ell(w)+\ell(x)} \bar p_{x,w} T_x$. So $C_w = \bar{P}^{-1} P C'_w$ which seems hard to compute in general. 

1 Many important properties of topological spaces are preserved by continuous maps (but not necessarily open maps): connectedness and compactness come to mind immediately. But more importantly, the most familiar, natural maps that we can define are continuous, but not necessarily open: polynomials $\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$. 2 Inverse image of a subgroup under a homomorphism is a subgroup. 3 There is a contravariant functor from the category Set to itself, mapping a set $X$ to its power set $\mathcal{P}(X)$ and sending the morphism $f:X \to Y$ to the inverse image $f^{-1}:\mathcal{P}(Y) \to \mathcal{P}(X)$. A "purely symmetric" function would be a symmetric relation on $X \times Y$, no? Functions are, after all, relations with an extra property that deliberately breaks the symmetry! 

My hunch is that the answer is no, but I couldn't find that statement in the literature. Perhaps it can be shown using an invariant of structured ring spectra, some flavor of $THH$. Or perhaps a dg-algebra over $\mathbb{Z}$ doesn't have enough room to encode the homotopical structure of the Steenrod algebra [1]. Remark. For the sake of definiteness, feel free to pick a model of spectra such as $S$-modules or symmetric spectra. The question is meant to be about the underlying symmetric monoidal $\infty$-category. In light of [2], working with your favorite model of spectra should be fine. [1] Shipley, Brooke, $H\Bbb Z$-algebra spectra are differential graded algebras, Am. J. Math. 129, No. 2, 351-379 (2007). ZBL1120.55007. [2] Mandell, M.A.; May, J.P.; Schwede, S.; Shipley, B., Model categories of diagram spectra, Proc. Lond. Math. Soc., III. Ser. 82, No.2, 441-512 (2001). ZBL1017.55004. 

My first candidate was symmetric spectra because there, the construction of $HA$ follows directly from a standard construction of Eilenberg-MacLane spaces $K(A,n)$ as topological abelian groups (or simplicial abelian groups, if working in simplicial sets). In particular, $HA$ is an abelian group object. Moreover, $HA$ is an $\Omega$-spectrum, and those are the fibrant objects in, for instance, the absolute projective stable model structure (Theorem III.4.11 in Schwede's book, or Theorem 3.4.4 in Hovey—Shipley—Smith). However, I'm still missing cofibrancy, and I suspect that a cofibrant replacement would mess up the abelian group object structure. Another idea would be to use the various stable model structures on symmetric spectra. One could also try in $S$-modules, where every object is fibrant. For the record, an associative smash product is not crucial to my purposes, though of course it would be nice. 

Aaron Lauda has a nice description using the package XY-pic here. There are commands that generate pieces of knots (such as crossings in various orientations), although I prefer just using the \crv "curve" command to make splines. 

Background Inside the Temperley-Lieb algebra $TL_n$ (with loop value $\delta=-[2]$ and standard generators $e_1,\ldots,e_{n-1}$), the Jones-Wenzl idempotent is the unique non-zero element $f^{(n)}$ satisfying $$ f^{(n)}f^{(n)} = f^{(n)} \quad \textrm{and} \quad e_i\;f^{(n)} = 0 = f^{(n)}e_i \quad \textrm{for each } i.$$ Consider the Iwahori-Hecke algebra $\mathcal{H}_n$, $n\ge3$, normalized so that $(T_i-q)(T_i+q^{-1})=0$, where $q$ is generic. Let $\mathcal{I}$ be the two-sided cellular ideal generated by canonical basis element $$C_{121} = T_1T_2T_1-qT_1T_2-qT_2T_1+q^2T_1+q^2T_2-q^3.$$ The assignment $\mathcal{H}_n \rightarrow TL_n$ given by $T_i \mapsto e_i + q$ is a surjective $\mathbb{C}(q)$-algebra homomorphism with kernel $\mathcal{I}$. We can lift the generators $e_i$ in $TL_n$ to the Kazhdan-Lusztig elements $C_i=T_i-q \in \mathcal{H}\_n$. In fact, we have $C_{121} = C_1C_2C_1 - C_1$, hence the relation down below. Rescaling a bit, $E=-\frac{1}{[3]!}C_{121}$ is an idempotent, corresponding to the partition $(1,1,1)$. Actually, all of the primitive idempotents in $\mathcal{H}_n$ that correspond to Young diagrams with more than two rows live in the ideal $\mathcal{I}$. Now, any preimage of $f^{(n)}$ in the Hecke algebra (call it $F^{(n)}$) satisfies $$F^{(n)}F^{(n)} \equiv F^{(n)} \quad \textrm{and} \quad C_iF^{(n)} \equiv 0 \equiv F^{(n)}C_i \quad (\operatorname{mod} \mathcal{I})$$ Question 

Given all digits of a sequence S till a certain length say n ie di ( i = 1 to n) ; if the probability of any next block of digits B in next m digits ( m -> infinity ) can be ascertained as < 1/(b^w) where b is the base and w is the string length of the block , through an algorithm which is guaranteed to halt then S is NOT a random sequence. Just being a normal number is not "sufficient" say the sequence 1234..101102103..10001001 is a normal sequence yet not random. Based on above since using the spigot formula for Pi I can predict its digits, it is not random. Direction of analysis is also important. Suppose there is a civilization where constant Pi has not been discovered yet ( let alone its formula), here a only a reverse analysis would be possible and the probability of one chancing upon the spigot formula while analysing the digits of Pi cannot be ruled out though its remote. Other wise the equidistribution of digits would lead such a civilisation to take Pi sequence as random 

"A sequence of bits is random if there exists no Program shorter than it which can produce the same sequence." ~ Kolmogorov Q: How do the digits of Pi fall as a random sequence based on the above definition
