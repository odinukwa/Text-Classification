I need to compute canonical forms of many (~10^6-10^8) vertex-facets incidence graphs of polytope. Two rather big examples I want to consider are 

If you replace "exactly one" by "at least one", this is the classical Erd≈ës-Ko-Rado problem, so I expect this question to be discussed before. I appreciate both an explanation and any references discussing it. Also, I have been computing a (very) few numbers and they appear to not be listed in the OEIS, though it is an array in $n$ and $k$, so there are variances how to search the OEIS for it. Background: such decks of cards exist as a children's two-player game where both players open one card each and the player first naming the common item gets both cards. The player getting all cards wins. 

These are several comments rather than an answer: As you write, let $(Q,w,S)$ denote all subwords of $Q$ whose greedy product is $w$ with positions $S$ skipped. I moreover write $(Q,w)$ for w in the Artin group to be all subwords of $Q$ that are words for $w$. 

Probably you mean Gross's Log-Sobolev Inequality? I cannot help with understanding any variational calculus proofs, but there are other proofs I find easier to understand. Actually, I prefer obtaining the Hypercontractive Inequality first, $\|P_t f\|_q \leq \|g\|_p$ provided $e^{-2t} \leq \frac{p-1}{q-1}$, and then recovering Log-Sobolev by taking $q = 2$, squaring both sides, and differentiating at $t = 0$. (See, e.g., exercise 10.23 at $URL$ ) As for the Hypercontractive Inequality itself, the most traditional short way to prove it (due to Gross, but also independently to Bonami previously) is to prove it first for Boolean functions (by induction on $n$) and then to pass to the Gaussian setting using the Central Limit Theorem. Janson's book Gaussian Hilbert Spaces (Chapter 5) does this nicely (or you can see Chapters 9, 10, 11 at the aforementioned web site). One can also prove Log-Sobolev directly by induction in the Boolean case (see, e.g., Exercise 10.26). If one only cares about the Gaussian setting, there are other short routes to Hypercontractivity (and hence Log-Sobolev). There is the "Neveu method"; although it's short, it uses stochastic calculus and is thus not very elementary. On the other hand, a very direct and simple proof is given in Ledoux's recent paper "Remarks on Gaussian Noise Sensitivity...", based on early ideas by Hu and by Mossel--Neeman. 

This is Exercise 7.2(f) in Stanley "Enumerative Combinatorics II": The length of the longest chain in dominance order is $$\frac{1}{3}m(m^2+3r-1)$$ where $n = \binom{m+1}{2} + r$ with $0 \leq r \leq m$. 

I suggest, you really look carefully into the reference "Humphreys, Reflection and Coxeter groups" (link behind paywall), as you again find the answer there. Please look into the reference for details below. In case, you have no access to it, you might be lucky searching for it on the web (you can also drop me a line). First, one has to define a root system for $W$ (done in Section 5.4) as $\Phi = \{w(\alpha_s) : w \in W, s \in S\}$. Then there is a decomposition $\Phi = \Phi^+ \sqcup -\Phi^+$ with $\Phi^+ = \Phi \cap \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}\Delta$ for $\Delta = \{\alpha_s : s \in S\}$. And finally, by construction, $R = \{ s_\beta : \beta \in \Phi^+\}$ and this is a bijective correspondence. So the answer to your question is yes. 

I too was looking into this recently and found good citations difficult to find. Here are two I found which I can recommend: .1. In the book "Special Functions and their Applications" by Lebedev, he gives the following clear theorem statement (with a moderately technical but not too bad-looking proof): "Assume $f \in L^2(\gamma)$ (i.e., is square-integrable w.r.t. the standard Gaussian measure) and is piecewise-$\mathcal{C}^1$ on every finite interval $[-a,a]$. Then the Hermite expansion of $f$ converges pointwise at every point of continuity of $f$ (and further, converges to $(f(x+)-f(x-))/2$ at any jump discontinuity $x$). It would be nice to also know that one has uniform convergence on any interval $[-a,a]$, but I didn't immediately see how to read that out. .2. The book "Gaussian measures" by Bogachev gives pretty careful statements about the domains under which formal operations (e.g., differentiation of Hermite expansions) hold. 

If f is boolean-valued and all of its degree-1 coefficients are small then the weight at level 1 is not more than $2/\pi$; If f is boolean-valued and has very small variance $\alpha$ then the weight at level 1 is at most $2 \alpha \log_2(1/\alpha)$. ["Chang's Lemma", or "Talagrand's Lemma"] 

Euler-Mahonian statistics on permutations: A pair of statistic $stat_1,stat_2$ is Euler-Mahonian if it is equidistributed with the bistatistic given by the number of descents and the major index, i.e., $$\sum_{\sigma\in S_n}q^{stat_1(\sigma)}t^{stat_2(\sigma)} = \sum_{\sigma\in S_n} q^{des(\sigma)}t^{maj(\sigma)}$$ where $S_n$ denotes the group of permutations of $1,\dots ,n$. The following statistics are Euler-Mahonian: 

$a_1 = 0$. $a_{k+1} \leq a_k+1$, If $a$ contains an $i\geq 1$, then there is an $i-1$ after the first $i$, 

The complete path we obtain in thus $NENNENNNENEEENEE$. This map sends the dinv statistic (this is, the number of pairs $k<\ell$ with $a_k-a_\ell \in \{0,1\} $) to the area, where the area below the bounce path comes from those pairs with $a_k-a_\ell = 0$, and the parts in between from the pairs with $a_k-a_\ell = 1$). Moreover, an inner touch point is reached if and only if all $i$'s come after all $i-1$'s within $a$ for any $i$. In the example, this happens only for $0$'s and $1$'s, thus giving one touch point. Given the last observation, we see that $a$ satisfies Property $C3$ if and only if $\zeta(a)$ touches the diagonal only in the very beginning and in the very end, and nowhere in between. So we thus reached a bijection between sequences satisfying Property $A$ and Dyck paths that do not have inner returns to the diagonal. Finally, stripping off the first north and the last east step yields a Dyck path of length $2n-2$, and we have obtained a complete bijection. In order make every step in my bijection visible, I provided a Sage worksheet implementing each step for a better understanding: $URL$ If anything is unclear or wrong, please let me know so I can try to fix it... 

I think a keyword to help you here is Rademacher Complexity. Learning theorists know a lot about these kinds of questions. In particular, for the intervals-on-a-line case, the high-probability bound for the maximum discrepancy should be $O(1/\sqrt{n})$, where $n = |O|$. More generally, if $O \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ and $T$ must be the intersection of $O$ with a halfspace, the bound should be $O(\sqrt{d/n})$, I think. [I could be mistaken here, I didn't look at the details very carefully.] 

Reminds me a bit of Talagrand's 2nd $1000 conjecture, a special case of which is the following: Let $f$ be a nonnegative function on the reals and let $g = U_t f$, where $U_t$ is the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup and $t$ is some fixed positive number; say, $t = 1$. Then Markov's inequality is not tight for $g$; i.e., $\Pr[g > c \mathrm{E}[g]] = o(c)$, where the probability is with respect to the Gaussian distribution. I'm pretty sure this special case is hard enough that Talagrand would give you a fraction of the $1000 for it. 

On @Gjergji Zaimi's request, I turn my comment into an answer (and extend it a bit): There were many (as far as I know unsuccessful) attempts to understand the major index in a way that makes it possible to uniformly generalize it to other finite Weyl/Coxeter groups, see e.g. $URL$ and $URL$ and the references therein. Observe that any geometric approach that does generalize in this sense would provide such a generalized definition. I would therefore rather hope for a geometric interpretation that is strongly attached to the combinatorics/geometry of the symmetric group. Finally: when not looking at the complete symmetric group $\mathcal{S}_n$ but only on noncrossing permutations, or, equivalently, on Dyck paths, the major index is related to MacMahon's q-Catalan numbers, see $URL$ There is a uniform generalization thereof as a bigraded Hilbert series of certain graded modules over the rational Cherednik algebra for any well-generated complex reflection group. Those can be found in $URL$ and in $URL$ But it is not at all clear if 

I always prefer to have error bounds for the CLT, so my favorite reference for your question is the paper "A Lyapunov type bound in $\mathbb{R}^d$" by Vidmantas Bentkus (Theory of Probability & Its Applications 49(2), 311--323, 2005). From the abstract: Let $X_1, \dots, X_n$ be independent, mean-zero, $\mathbb{R}^d$-valued random variables. Let $S = X_1 + \cdots + X_n$ and let $C^2$ be the covariance matrix of $S$, assumed invertible. Let $Z$ be a $d$-dimensional Gaussian with mean zero and covariance $C^2$. Then for any convex subset $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$, $$|\Pr[S \in A] - \Pr[Z \in A]| \leq O(d^{1/4}) \cdot \beta,$$ where $\beta = \sum_{i} \mathbf{E}[|C^{-1}X_i|^3]$. This is a $d$-dimensional generalization of the Berry--Esseen Theorem. 

Yes, as you say, both usages occur in the literature, with "total number of bits in the input" being more prevalent in interior point papers. But I guess Vaidya has noticed that one can be more careful about things. By the way, I believe the fastest known algorithm for linear programming is from Vaidya's paper "Speeding-up linear programming using fast matrix multiplication". The running time is $O((m+n)^{1.5} n L)$ arithmetic operations, where $L$ is again the more complicated quantity, roughly the log of the max subdeterminant. 

Below my modified answer containing a complete bijection between the above sequences and Dyck paths: Let $a = (a_1,\ldots,a_n)$ be a sequence of $n$ integers. $a$ satisfies Property $A$ if it satisfies your two conditions above. This is 

If yes, this is the same as asking which reflection subgroups are there in $(W',S')$ that are isomorphic to $(W,S)$. By "Dyer - Reflection subgroups of Coxeter systems" (and in parallel by a paper of Dheodar), every reflection subgroup it itself a Coxeter group with canonical Coxeter generators depending on $S'$. This gives a (computationally feasible) way to systematically search for reflection subgroups in $(W',S')$ isomorphic to $(W,S)$. On the other hand, I am not aware of a more clever way to determine how $(W,S)$ embeds into $(W',S')$. 

@PietroMajer's comment essentially contained the answer already: Define a bijection $\phi$ between $k$-multisubsets of $\{ 1,\ldots,n \}$ to $k$-subsets of $\{ 1,\ldots,n+k-1\}$ by sending $\{ c_0 \leq c_1 \leq \ldots \leq c_{k-1} \}$ to $\{ c_0 < c_1+1 < c_2 + 2 < \ldots < c_{k-1}+k-1 \}$. This map sends lex order on the $k$-multisubsets to lex order on $k$-subsets. Thus, given your lex-position map $f$ on $k$-subsets provides the lex-position map $f \circ \phi$ on $k$-multisubsets. 

This does not fit the original poster's question but is vaguely related: I have heard it said that Carleson did not get the Fields Medal in '66 because his proof of Carleson's Theorem was too difficult to read and verify at the time. (Granted, the result was only published in '66.) And alas, he was too old to get it in '70. 

The classic example, given in all complexity classes I've ever taken, is the following: Imagine your friend is color-blind. You have two billiard balls; one is red, one is green, but they are otherwise identical. To your friend they seem completely identical, and he is skeptical that they are actually distinguishable. You want to prove to him (I say "him" as most color-blind people are male) that they are in fact differently-colored. On the other hand, you do not want him to learn which is red and which is green. Here is the proof system. You give the two balls to your friend so that he is holding one in each hand. You can see the balls at this point, but you don't tell him which is which. Your friend then puts both hands behind his back. Next, he either switches the balls between his hands, or leaves them be, with probability 1/2 each. Finally, he brings them out from behind his back. You now have to "guess" whether or not he switched the balls. By looking at their colors, you can of course say with certainty whether or not he switched them. On the other hand, if they were the same color and hence indistinguishable, there is no way you could guess correctly with probability higher than 1/2. If you and your friend repeat this "proof" $t$ times (for large $t$), your friend should become convinced that the balls are indeed differently colored; otherwise, the probability that you would have succeeded at identifying all the switch/non-switches is at most $2^{-t}$. Furthermore, the proof is "zero-knowledge" because your friend never learns which ball is green and which is red; indeed, he gains no knowledge about how to distinguish the balls. 

(It is known that the roots of $E_n$ separate the roots of $E_{n+1}$. This is, $$q_1^{(n+1)} < q_1^{(n)} < \cdots < q_{n}^{(n+1)}< q_n^{(n)} < q_{n+1}^{(n+1)}$$ when they come in sorted order. That's not the type of property I am looking for, but only properties towards their explicit values.) Here are the first two examples and the type of property I would like to have answered from a description I search for: $$ \begin{align*} E_2(z) &= z^2 + 4z + 1 = (z+2-\sqrt{3})(z+2+\sqrt{3}) \\ E_3(z) &= z^3 + 11z^2 + 11z + 1 = (z+5+2\sqrt{6})(z+5-2\sqrt{6})(z+1) \end{align*} $$ (The roots become more complicated than $a\pm b\sqrt{c}$ for bigger $n$'s.) It is known that the mean value of the discrete distribution given by $E_n$ is $n/2$ and the variance is $(n+2)/12$. This can be used to show that $$ \begin{align*} \sum_i \frac{1}{1+q^{(n)}_i} &= \frac{n}{2} \\ \sum_i \frac{q^{(n)}_i}{\big(1+q^{(n)}_i\big)^2} &= \frac{n+2}{12} \end{align*} $$ Doing this computation in the first example yields $$ \frac{1}{1+2+\sqrt{3}} + \frac{1}{1+2-\sqrt{3}} = 1 $$ and $$ \frac{2+\sqrt{3}}{(1+2+\sqrt{3})^2} + \frac{2-\sqrt{3}}{(1+2-\sqrt{3})^2} = \frac{1}{3} $$
