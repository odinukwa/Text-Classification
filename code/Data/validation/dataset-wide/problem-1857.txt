Mistake #1 was adding your manager to your Facebook friends list in the first place. As the old saying goes, don't mix business with pleasure. By adding him to your Facebook, you have opened a Pandora's box for the guy to be intrusive in your personal life. I suggest you remove him from your friends list right away (and maybe even block him), and either you can contact him (or wait for him to contact you) and let him know that you feel you need to put some distance between your work relationships and your personal life. If he asks why, just respond in a way that lets him know that your choice is not something that's negotiable. If you like, offer him the alternative of your work e-mail or work telephone number. But you are not obligated at all to have him on your Facebook friends list. 

As soon as you can: DO inform them that you'll be travelling abroad, and as appropriate, specifically convey the dates, and contact information to be used during your absence should they need to set up your interview immediately thereafter. DON'T ask about the second interview yet, or you may come off as being pushy. If they've got a date pending already, it may be mentioned after you announce your travel plans, and maybe they'll set up another date right away. Maybe they'll offer a date before you leave, but otherwise let it go for now. It's probably appropriate to contact them just before you head back, if you haven't heard otherwise. 

Generally, this is how it works: Time from your residence, to the FIRST work location of your day, is unpaid. Travel time to any subsequent locations, after the first location, is paid time. Travel time back to the first location is paid time. Going home from there is unpaid time. 

You COULD answer questions with, "I'm not going to be here on (date)". When asked where you're going, just say, "I can't share that with you." People will figure stuff out on their own, and if your boss asks, you can be honest in saying you haven't told anyone you are leaving. Got it? 

This move isn't your officemates' issue whatsoever. The only people that really need to be involved are the mailroom, your boss, HR/payroll (in case you need a paycheck or similar delivered to you personally), and maybe facilities and IT. It's not your responsibility to make everyone else comfortable with why you're moving. You're dealing with grown people. They're going to say whatever they're going to say whether you add in your own "defense" or not. The only person you can control is yourself. 

Severance is not an entitlement, so that's out. If they terminate you, you can draw unemployment, so that's out. Options aren't usually worth the paper they're printed on, and that assumes you have anything in writing about them in the first place. That said - they really didn't need your department. This sounds like a startup situation. They've tried to be nice and fit you elsewhere to save on recruitment costs, but it's not an optimal fit. So here you are. Start looking. Maybe you'll get a severance, and maybe not. 

I am not an attorney, but I'd bet money that your employer cannot make you waive your legal rights under Missouri state law.. here's an excerpt: 

If all else fails, tell HIS boss what's going on, and how YOU can do a better job. If you're not prepared to do a better job, then you might want to let your boss BE the boss. He's not obligated to you. No, it's not a nice situation. But that's why people get new jobs. 

If you look past the supposed slight, you'll see that he is actually protecting you from the other manager. He is protecting you from having to put in overtime or from becoming overworked in order to meet this other manager's demand and whatever his deadline is. And that's a good thing. It means your manager is putting his project and his people first. If you don't like your manager, or if he treats employees in a poor manner, that's something different, and it's a product of his character. But his usage of the word "resources" has absolutely no bearing on that, and he uses it appropriately for a business setting. 

They're genuinely not trying to be rude or impolite. But how I can impress upon them that I actually need an answer without being rude, impolite, or improper in return? I already mentioned in an email to them two weeks ago that I had to know because I was pursuing other opportunities: 

It's not meant to be offensive. You take it to be dehumanizing, as treating you like an object. And in a sense, you are correct. In a large business, people simply are things, each of which has a function (your job), a price (your salary), and a value (how much you add to the company). To people like Senior Vice Presidents, workers are assets, exactly the same as the office in which you work, the equipment you use, and the product you produce/sell. You may not like the fact that you boil down to just another number in someone's figures, at the end of the day, but that's the truth of the matter. But there's no need to be offended by this! There is absolutely no negative connotation in a manager calling the people he manages "resources". My manager refers to me as a resource to other business people, and we have an excellent relationship, both professionally and personally. This issue is in your mindset, not in your manager. You are taking insult to something where no insult is intended or even present. Instead, focus on what your manager is actually saying: 

... but I feel like that's way too impersonal and detached, and the websites I've read tend to agree. But I just don't know what to put there, or whether I should just take it out entirely, or what. 

In reading the other answers, it seems to me that they try to skirt around the issue and circumvent the actual question by saying something like: 

I have been searching for a new job for about three months. I had a fantastic interview about a month ago with a place that I really, really would like to work for. It all went very well. But they seem to move incredibly slowly when it comes to this kind of thing. I've communicated with them since then, and the selection/hiring process is moving along as it ought to be. They're just taking their sweet time. Meanwhile, I've gone through the entire process of two other companies, one of which is going to give me the final interview next week and (assuming all goes well) make me an offer. A very good and attractive offer, too, one that would be a big step forward for my career. I really want to work for the first place. They have the environment that I want, the culture that I want to be a part of, and some fringe benefits that I can't get many other places. But I can't just blow off every other opportunity and assume they're going to give me the job. I followed up with them once again today, and they simply said: 

Doing a code walk-through will absolutely be a waste of your time. Trying boiling things down to a two-or-three page document, with a diagram or two, that summarizes your current work. Leave out technical jargon as much as you can. You just want to get the person into the "ball park" without exhausting yourself in the process. It's perfectly okay to ask for a few hours' time to prepare a WRITTEN summary. Put an emphasis on WRITTEN, as this will help you to not keep repeating yourself (and becoming more frustrated at each turn). Make sure you're writing for (smile) an 8th-grade audience and by this I mean assume that the reader understands only basic concepts. Best of luck. 

If you are in the United States, then this is a Digital Millenium Copyright Act violation unless you get a license from the copyright holders. It's one thing to put it on your PC from stuff you are authorized to use, but a whole other thing to put it on a company network for sharing. This would be very dumb because any disgruntled employee could put your company in hot water with a single phone call. I'm certain other countries beside the US will have similar legislation. 

This is not a decent person. A decent person values other peoples' training and time, and works with integrity. It doesn't matter that you both speak the language. This guy is trying to get something for nothing; and as a contractor, you have no expectation of being around to have the "favor" returned. 

Frankly, unless you can relate it directly to the ability of your candidate to do the requirements of the job, OR some disruption to your office, it's really none of your business who the candidate showed up with. Maybe they're travelling together today to run errands, and the interview was on the way between point A and point C. It might seem more reasonable for Mom to come inside and sit in an air-cooled office than to send Mom to the mall or Starbucks, or let her sit in a car for an hour. To some degree, we can take into account how your office is situated, and the line of business -- but at the end of the day, a waiting room is for people to WAIT in. Had the applicant dragged Mom into the interview room, we'd have a different situation. Had Mom been someone with a behavior or outward appearance to cause alarm to anyone in your facility, again, a different situation. You didn't mention that either of these were the case. Accordingly, you can't assume anything about your candidate, or their relationship, from the fact that Mom sat in the waiting room; the only thing that you can assume is that, apparently, Mom needed to sit. 

OK. Let's even this up a bit. As a junior developer, you're not there to be in a leadership role yet. You've identified already that you barely know what you're doing. How do you realistically expect others to take direction from you? Still, it's good that you can sense that something's broken. Rather than overwhelming yourself with trying to change what the entire team is doing, you can focus on consistent results in the work product that comes from your desk alone. When you do that, you'll come to be known as a person turning out reliable, maintainable, and scalable code. When issues come up with others or bigger processes, then you have the opportunity to speak up and make suggestions. Until you have that kind of reputation, you need to lean back a bit. None of these things gets fixed in a day. They've been messed up for a long time since before you showed up, and they might be the same when you get your next job - but you don't need to blow a gasket over the situation. Sometimes, you have to let people fall down before they become believers of the concept called "gravity"; you can explain, demand, urge until you're blue in the face, but no one will get it until they've fallen down and skinned their knees. Relax! One day at a time.
