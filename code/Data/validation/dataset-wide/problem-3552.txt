Depends what your goals are, possibly you don't need to even do flies or db press. Normal barbell bench and dips could do the trick. 

Tell yourself do you want to age faster, your body breakdown faster, have less energy, etc if you don't stay physically active? Try and keep a log of your exercises and weight, you'll see and enjoy your progression to keep you motivated to go even further. :) 

This is what I do (more frequency and time but same principal). Split body in 3 days: Day 1 - Chest and triceps, usually shortest day for me so can include some cardio Day 2 - Back and biceps Day 3 - Shoulders and legs Because of the restricted time, most exercises will have to be performed in super sets (a form of cardio) while the weights will be moderate to heavy (increase a tad of weight after each set). On back day, I do so much back work that I only do one bicep exercise since your biceps are being used in pulling exercises. Same principle for chest and triceps, your triceps get used in pushing exercises so no need to really target them. Some exercises work on your core and abs at the same time so no need to waste time on those as well! Standing shoulder press, squats, dead-lifts, standing triceps work. Nutrition is key if you want definition but the above will keep you in shape and add muscle. Going heavy works on your VO2 max which in turn is like doing cardio. In addition, avoid using machines, compound movements (movements that work many muscles at once) are the best when short on time or want general strength (which is this case). 

I have become extremely flexible within two months after changing my squats going totally down with slow negatives/aggressive up-down, it has improved my vertical split massively. Side oversplit looks like below but it can also be done on floor, by street dancers, by hockey goal-keepers, by dancers, by martial artists and so on. This question is not specific to any specific sport instead focus on flexibility and how to improve it. When I train for flexibility, glucosamine from seashell foods helps me to recover faster and making gains faster. How can you improve horizontal splits? 

There are many factors contributing to the legspan and rarity of people achieve maximal legspan such as different splits. The legspan affects functional skills such different running styles so having an impact on different running styles and different forward movements such as galloping. It is hard to assess legspan such as dynamic legspan while the non-dynamic legspan is somewhat easier to assess. Yet even in non-dynamic legspan assesssment, things such as core twisting can make it hard to assess. So How to asssess legspan in different running styles? Where can you find procedures for legspan asssessment particularly for runners? 

Exercise-induced (EI) hypersensitivity disorders contain EI-asthma, EI-bronchoconstriction, EI-rhinitis, EI-anaphylaxis and EIâ€“urticaria. They can occur in both recretional athletes and elete athletes as mentioned in the question. The reasons for EI hypersensitivity contain 

than usually and doubled casein for the night -- after that muscles started to feel nice again. When I feel stiffness, taking more vitamins relaxes the body: it works, I don't know why. It is almost impossible to know which is enough: I train by feeling -- as large weights as possible, long pauses and as many times as possible. I train in gym. Is there any guidelines how much more vitamins, nutrition etc should a healthy athletic person take during vo2max week? 

I would cut the cardio and do more heavy compound movements and body weight exercises, ie squats, deadlifts, bent-over barbell rows, standing barbell shoulder press, bench press, dips, pull-ups etc as in you'll be doing cardio (VO2 work) anyways while performing these exercises. You are only doing these exercises correctly if you are pretty much out of breath after a set, make sure the weight is heavy enough. Also, forget isolation exercises or machines, focus on barbells or dumbells. For example for biceps do something like the following that targets the back: bent-over barbell rows chin-ups pull-ups neutral grip pull-ups The beauty of compound movements is that more than one muscle is trained, for example I have visible abs from not doing a single ab exercise...squats, heavy standing shoulder press and a couple of others hit the abs hard. Most back work (like above) will work your biceps so you get to save time too. I can provide my 3-day training split if you like, let me know! 

Short answer: you will not be able to do that amount of weight, your body is not prepared for that movement with any amount of weight (unless you do some push-ups once in a while). You should congratulate your daughter and be proud of her, benching your body weight is a nice goal to have for beginners and intermediates. 2X your body weight is no small feat (I can't even do that, my max bench was 315 and I'm about 200 pounds), 3X is very rare! 

Maximal legspan contain lateral and vertical movements such as vertical splits and lateral splits. Rarity of people achieve sufficient technique and strength to maintain different splits and rotational movements of thighs so they are hard-to-use benchmarks. Many factors contribute to legspan. Factors contain core flexibility, core strength, pelvis tilt and lateral hamstring movements. Fractures in vertebrae can lead to kyphosis i.e. dowager's hump (Life Span Motor Development, p.54, 2nd ed) that can stress muscles such as psoas muscle worsening movements of leg. The postnatal development contain rapid development of supranals (adrenal glands) until about 20 years old and uterus. Also the fat distribution from core and extremities change from adolescents to maturation. The range of leg motion changes over time. Maturition contain progession while the old age contain regression. Hence the patterns of motion change. Life span motor movements in legs contain learning different gaits such as walking, running, skipping and galloping. Running is a symmetric locomotor skill while galloping is asymmetric. Running is more energy efficient than galloping because less need for stability in waist than with galloping. Simple ways to assess leg span contain ruler. Measurements should assess the proportions of different limbs. Also as mentioned in the question, the core twisting should be acknowledged. A more straightforward way to assess running can be muscle mass analysis. Because advanced runners have more muscle mass in legs, it makes it natural to assess it directly with different resistance measurements such as InBody measurements. The impact of a single legspan characteristic can be quite meaningless. Running A beginning runner has a limited range of motion. The arms and legs swing to the side rather than rhythmic forward-backward.
