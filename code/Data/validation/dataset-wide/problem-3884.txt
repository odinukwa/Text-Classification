What you are asking for is possible $f$-vectors of Clique Complexes. The Kruskal-Katona Theorem characterizes $f$-vectors of simplicial complexes; so, it applies here but is no longer a complete characterization. Your problem is open according to this paper. The linked paper and references there in contain partial results. Edit: This answer assumes the number of $k$-cliques of $G$ is $a_k$ for $1 \leq k \leq n$ and $0$ for $k > n$. Another interpretation of the question would be that the number of $k$-cliques of $G$ is $a_k$ for $1 \leq k \leq n$ and there is no restriction on the number of $k$-cliques for $k > n$. The OP has expressed interest in both variations in the comments. 

You can look into Levenshtein automaton. The main references are Fast String Correction with Levenshtein-Automata by Schulz and Mihov and Deciding word neighborhood with universal neighborhood automata by Mitankin, Mihov, and Schulz. There is an implementation called liblevenshtein which you can play with online here. This algorithm gives you all words at distance at most $k$ from your string. So to get words that are at distance exactly $k$ you must remove the words at distance less than or equal to $k-1$. 

Finding the largest possible set of words of length $n$ over a given alphabet with a specified minimum distance is in general a hard problem. In terms of coding theory the minimum distance determines the number of errors which can be corrected/detected. The size of the set $S$ in question is bounded between the Hamming bound and the Gilbert–Varshamov bound. When these bounds (or some other upper and lower bounds) match we get the maximal size of such and $S$. Otherwise one has to search for a set size between the known bounds. One can find tables for maximum size of such sets in question. For example see here. 

Recall how the quiver and its mutations encode the clusters the their mutations. The vertices of the quiver correspond to cluster variables. When we mutate at a vertex $x$ the arrows change as prescribed while all vertices except $x$ stay the same. The vertex $x$ is replaced by $x'$ and we have the relation $$xx' = M_{in} + M_{out}$$ where $M_{in}$ and $M_{out}$ are monomials consisting of vertices adjacent to $x$ by incoming and out going arrows respectively. See pages 23 and 26 of the linked notes for details. Now look at the exchange relations for the chamber minors on page 19. This tells us what the arrows must look like for the quiver mutations to correspond to the braid moves. For this example direct horizontal arrows left and direct vertical arrows right. In the picture on the lower left of page 24 move the vertex corresponding the $\Delta_{13}$ up so it is to the left of $\Delta_{23}$, then it follows this rule. 

The authors are requiring more than just the sentence in question. The whole paragraph is needed. The lemmata proven say a minimal counter example $M$ must have no parallel elements and corank at most 2. The authors then note this also holds when replacing $M$ with its dual. So, the claim really is that if $M$ is connected, does not have any parallel nor any coparallel elements, and both the rank and corank are at most 2. Then $M$ is isomorphic to $U_2(4)$. 

A variation where the robber is invisible until at distance $\ell$ of some cop for a fixed parameter $\ell$ is considered in the preprint Limited Visibility Cops and Robbers. The version you suggest is $\ell = 1$, and the preprint cites the following master's thesis as a source for the $\ell=1$ case: 

You should look at Positivity and canonical bases in rank 2 cluster algebras of finite and affine types by Sherman and Zelevinsky where they are able to construct a canonical basis explicitly for finte type and affine type (i.e. $bc < 4$ and $bc = 4$ respectively). Your $B$ is a basis for $A$ called the standard monomial basis. However it is not canonical as you can choose any four consecutive $x_i, x_{i+1}, x_{i+2}, x_{i + 3}$. Also it does not have the following notion of positivity. Given $y \in A$ we call $y$ positive if the expansion of $y$ as a Laurent polynomial in every cluster $x_i, x_{i+1}$ has only positive coefficients. We want a basis so that the positive elements of $A$ are positive combinations of the basis elements. For $(b,c) = (2,2)$ consider $z = x_0x_3 - x_1x_2$, then $$z = \frac{x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 1}{x_1 x_2},$$ and by symmetry is also a Laurent polynomial with positive coefficients for any other cluster. For finite type the canonical basis is all cluster monomials and for affine type the basis is all cluster monomials along with some additional elements. 

Expanding on the comments of Andreas and Fedor I will point out a resource where this data is kept track of. This will give some measure of how unknown these numbers are (and when they are actually known). For $m=2$ you are looking for the largest binary code of length $n$ with minimum distance $k$. Which as Fedor says is a a famous problem. Let $A(n,d)$ denote the maximum number codewords in binary code of length $n$ with minimum distance $d$. We have $A(n-1,2d-1) = A(n, 2d)$ so we can restrict attention to even minimum distance. There was a table for $A(n,d)$ in the paper Bounds for Binary Codes of Length Less than 25 by Best, Brouwer, MacWilliams, Odlyzko, and Sloane from 1978. Brouwer has a table on his webpage with updates to the table from the article above. On the Andries E. Brouwer's homepage you can find links to tables (with references) for $m=2,3,4,5$ (i.e. binary, ternary, etc.) and small $n$. The tables should be up to date, I see references as recent as 2016 on the pages for $m =3,4,5$. 

If $G_1$ and $G_2$ are graphs let $G_1 \vee G_2$ denote their wedge sum. That is, $G_1 \vee G_2$ is obtained by taking the one-point union of $G_1$ and $G_2$. It will not matter what vertices we decide to identify. If $G_1$ and $G_2$ have $k_1$ and $k_2$ spanning trees respectively, then $G_1 \vee G_2$ has $k_1k_2$ spanning trees. As Noam points out a $k$-cycle has $k$ spanning trees for $k \geq 3$. So, we have a graph with $k$ spanning trees on $k$ vertices. When $k$ is composite (with some caveats for the prime $2$) we can quickly do better using the above construction. For example, if we want $k = 9$ we take $K_3 \vee K_3$ which has $5$ vertices instead of $9$. 

I think your question is answered in A Complete Classification of Ternary Self-Dual Codes of Length 24 by Harada and Munemasa. Theorem 1 of the paper claims there are 166 inequivalent ternary self dual codes of weight 6 and 170 inequivalent ternary self dual codes of weight 3. 

In the literature this problem also goes by "set packing" which can help find references. The set-up in this language is given a universe $V$ of $n$ elements and family of subsets $E$ a packing is a collection of mutually disjoint sets from $E$ (i.e. a matching). A $t$-packing is a packing consisting of $t$ sets. The problem of counting $t$-packings in the $k$-uniform case where each element of $E$ contains exactly $k$ elements is considered in 

Let $G$ be a graph with $2n$ vertices with a unique perfect matching $M$. Choose any $2$ edges from $M$ and consider the $4$ vertices present. In addition to the $2$ edges from the matching there can be at most $2$ more edges if we want the matching to be unique. Thus the number of edges must be less than or equal to $n + 2\binom{n}{2} = n^2$. This bound can certainly be realized. Let $G_{2n}$ be the graph with vertex set $$\{x_i : 1 \leq i \leq n\} \cup \{y_i : 1 \leq i \leq n\}$$ and edge set $$\{x_ix_j : 1 \leq i < j \leq n\} \cup \{x_iy_j : 1 \leq i \leq j \leq n\}.$$ We see that $G_{2n}$ has $2n$ vertices and $n^2$ edges. Moreover $\{x_iy_i : 1 \leq i \leq n\}$ and the unique perfect matching in $G_{2n}.$ Notice this is exactly the graph constructed by Wolfgang in his answer (and also alternatively constructed by Yoav Kallus in a comment to Wolfgang's answer). Furthermore Wolfgang asks if $G_{2n}$ is the unique graph on $2n$ vertices with $n^2$ that has a unique perfect matching. We will now show this is the case. Let $H$ be a graph on $2n$ vertices with $n^2$ edges such that $H$ has a unique perfect matching. Let $\{x_iy_i : 1 \leq i \leq n\}$ be the unique perfect matching in $H$. Let $H_{ij}$ denote the subgraph induced by vertices $\{x_i, y_i, x_j, y_j\}$ for any $1 \leq i,j \leq n$. Then $H_{ij}$ is a graph on $4$ vertices with $4$ edges for all $1 \leq i,j \leq n$. We know the number of edges in $H_{ij}$ is bounded above by $4$ from our argument for the upper bound, and it must be exactly $4$ to have $n^2$ total edges. In fact each $H_{ij}$ is isomorphic to the graph on vertex set $\{1,2,3,4\}$ with edge set $\{12,13,14,34\}$. Claim: Fix $1 \leq i \leq n$. If $\deg_{H_{ij}}(x_i) = 3$ for some $1 \leq j \leq n$, then $\deg_{H_{ik}}(y_i) < 3$ for all $1 \leq k \leq n$. Proof) If $\deg_{H_{ij}}(x_i) = 3$, then $H_{ij}$ has edge set $\{x_iy_i, x_ix_j, x_iy_j, x_jy_j\}$. Assume $\deg_{H_{ik}}(y_i) = 3$ for some $k$, then $H_{ik}$ has edge set $\{x_iy_i, x_ky_i, y_iy_k, x_ky_k\}$. But this contradicts $H$ having a unique perfect matching (check that $H_{ijk}$, which is the subgraph of $H$ induced by vertices $\{x_i,y_i,x_j,y_j,x_k,y_k\}$, would have multiple perfect matchings by considering possible edges in $H_{ik}$). QED Now assume without loss of generality that the vertices are labelled such that $\deg_{H_{ij}}(y_i) < 3$ always (or equivalently, the unique degree $3$ vertex in $H_{ij}$ is always $x_i$ or $x_j$). Define a relation $x_i \prec x_j$ if and only if $x_iy_j$ is an edge in $H$. Claim: $(\{x_i : 1 \leq i \leq n\}, \prec)$ is a totally ordered set. Proof) First note either $x_i \prec x_j$ or $x_j \prec x_i$ for any $i,j$ since either $x_i$ or $x_j$ in the degree $3$ vertex in $H_{ij}$. We have $x_i \prec x_i$ since $x_iy_i$ is an edge of $H$. If $x_i \prec x_j$ and $x_j \prec x_i$, then $x_i = x_j$ otherwise the uniqueness of the prefect matching would be contradicted. Finally we verify transitivity. Take $x_i, x_j$ with $x_i \prec x_j$ and $x_j \prec x_k$. Assume $x_k \prec x_i$, then $H_{ijk}$ has the prefect matching $\{x_iy_j, x_jy_k, x_ky_i\}$ with is a contraction. Thus $x_i \prec x_k$ and $\prec$ is transitive. QED Now this total order on $\{x_i : 1 \leq i \leq n\}$ describes an isomorphism $H$ to $G_{2n}$ and therefore $G_{2n}$ is the unique graph (up to isomorphism) with $2n$ vertices, $n^2$ edges, and a unique perfect matching. 

It also seems for $\mathrm{perm}\, A_{n,n}$ the signs follow a pattern $\mod 4$ which has been checked up to $n = 100.$ 

where it is shown that such $t$-packings can be counted in $O^*(\binom{n}{tk/2})$ time. Here $O^*$ suppresses a factor polynomial is the mentioned parameters. For perfect matching we need $tk = n$ so we end up with $O^*(\binom{n}{n/2})$. Methods in this approach use a disjoint sum problem, inclusion-exclusion, and dynamic programming. So, this provides some answer to question 1. It was the fastest algorithm I found, but I did not attempt to perform an exhaustive search of the literature. Perhaps this article, references within, and the term "set packing" can help to up further relevant information. Also, again in the $k$-uniform case, parameterized by $t$ the problem of counting $t$-packing is shown to by $W[1]\#$-hard in 

They are taking a graph $\Gamma$ and letting $\Gamma^{(m)}$ denote $\Gamma$ with $m$ paralel edges inserted between two chosen vertices. Then one of the invariants $U$ they study (i.e. the Tutte polynomial) will satisfy $$U(\Gamma^{(m)}) = f_{m+1}U(\Gamma) + g_{m+1}U(\Gamma \setminus e) + h_{m+1}U(\Gamma / e)$$ for some sequences $f_m, g_m, h_m$. They want to find the associated exponential generating functions for the sequences (i.e. $f(s) = \sum f_m(s^m/m!)$, etc.). The paper then claims $f(s) = \sinh(s)$ and $g(s) = \cosh(s)$ is then solution when $U$ is the Tutte polynomial (they make a choice of 'representation' of the Tutte polynomial in (6.3) and choice of initial conditions in (6.1) to arrive at these particular functions which lead to these exponential generating functions for the Tutte polynomial). Hence, then ratio gives $\tanh(s)$. 

Let $G = (V,E)$ be a connected graph on $n$ vertices. The star at vertex $v$ described in the question is the cut-set associated the partition $v \uplus V\setminus v$ of the vertices. We remark that these cut-sets will be independent sets when $G$ is a simple graph, but will not always be independent sets for general (multi)graphs. Take any $n-1$ vertices, the cut-sets associated the these vertices given a basis of the cut-space of $G$. The cut-space is the orthgonal complement of the cycle-space of $G$ in the edge-space which is $\mathbb{F}_2^E$ where addition is given by symmetric difference. We now give a generalization of the OP's observation that every spanning tree can be decomposed over the cut-sets of vertices. 

Again not an answer, but just some more context and evidence that this problem seems hard. As Aaron Meyerwitz points out this is typically called the refinement order and seems like a difficult problem. Let $P_n$ be the poset of integer partitions partially order by refinement. This poset has minimal element $\hat{0} = 1^n$ the partition with all parts $1$ and maximal element $\hat{1} = n$ the partition with a unique part $n$. The quantity you are looks for is $$F(n) = \sum_{\lambda \in P_n} |[\hat{0}, \lambda]|$$ the sum of the sizes of all lower order ideals in $P_n$. Zeigler has a paper On the Poset of Partitions of an Integer. Essentially this paper shows that the poset $P_n$ lacks some nice properties and is rather unpredictable. The poset $P_n$ is ranked where the elements at rank $k$ are partitions with $n-k$ parts. So the Whitney numbers of the second kind are $p(n,n-k)$ the number of ways to partitions $n$ into $n-k$ parts. There is a recurrence for $p(n,k)$ (see for example the pretty well developed MathWorld page on partitions). However, I see a problem in the fact the intervals at the same rank can be very different. For example consider $[\hat{0},2^n]$ and $[\hat{0}, (n+1,1^{n-1})]$ in $P_{2n}$. We have $|[\hat{0}, 2^n]| = n$ since it is just a chains with elements $(2^k, 1^{n-2k})$. On the other hand $|[\hat{0}, (n+1,1^{n-1})]| = p(n+1)$ the number of partitions of $n+1$ which has the asymptotic formula $p(n) \sim exp(\pi \sqrt{2n/3})/(4n\sqrt{3}))$ which is due to Hardy and Ramanujan. At this time I only see trivial and crude bounds for $F(n)$ is terms a $p(n)$. Though I would be happy to seem someone with more knowledge and more clever than me produce a nice bound. 

I believe the conjecture is still open. See the comment on Problem 476 and references therein for partial results in the paper below. 

The fact that the algebra is commutative has been discussed in the comments. So, I will address the bijectivity of $T_{a,b}$. I will assume we believe that we have a well defined algebra homomorphism since it is only asked why $T_{a,b}$ is a bijection. Here is a sketch of bijectivity. Our multiplication respects the usual (multi)degree of monomials since $x_1^ax_2^b \cdot x_1^cx_2^d = \pm x_1^{a+c}x_2^{b+d}$. We will consider some term order. Notice that $T_{a,b}(x_1^cx_2^d)$ is a power series with lowest term $x_1^cx_2^d$. More generally given any formal power series $f$ with lowest term $x_1^cx_2^d$, the power series $T_{a,b}(f)$ has lowest term $x_1^cx_2^d$. It follows that $T_{a,b}(f) = 0$ only if $f = 0$ and so $T_{a,b}$ is injective. To show $T_{a,b}$ is surjective we will show any monomial $x_1^cx_2^d$ is in the image. To do this start with $f_0 = x_1^cx_2^d$, then $T_{a,b}(f_0)$ is a power series with lowest term $x_1^cx_2^d$. Now define $f_1$ so that $T_{a,b}(f_1)$ cancels the second lowest term of $T_{a,b}(f_0)$. Consider $T_{a,b}(f_0 + f_1)$ and repeat. 

The first identity says that $$\{h(x) : x \in \lambda\} \cup \{\mu_i - \mu_j : 1 \leq i < j \leq k\} = \bigcup_{i=1}^k \{j : 1 \leq j \leq \mu_i\}$$ as multisets. The second identity then follows because the multisets of exponents are the same on the LHS and RHS. 

McMullen's $g$-conjecture aims the classify possible $f$-vectors of simplicial $d$-spheres. The $g$-conjecture has been proven for polytopal spheres and for simplicial spheres of dimension $d < 5$. I am wondering what computer searches have been done to verify (if you are an optimist) or search for counter examples (if you are a pessimist) of the $g$-conjecture. The only attempt I know of was by Björner and Lutz and was reported in the paper Simplicial manifolds, bistellar flips and a 16-vertex triangulation of the Poincaré homology 3-sphere from 2000. Here it appears Björner and Lutz looked at some (non-PL) simplicial spheres of dimension $d = 5,6$. I am curious if there have been any more attempts since 2000, and (perhaps too ambitiously) if anyone has been able to make a statement like: 

Exchange polynomials can be the same. What is proven is not that the exchange polynomials are coprime in the ring of Laurent polynomials with whatever coefficients you are using, but rather that they are coprime in the ring of Laurent polynomials with "universal coefficients." See the discussion on page 11 within the proof of Theorem 3.1 for the universal coefficients set up. Essentially what is done is a polynomial ring with an indeterminate for each for each coefficient in the exchange polynomials. That is $\mathbb P$ is the free abelian group generated by a certain collection of coefficients, and then we look at $\mathcal{L}_0$ which is a Laurent polynomials ring over $\mathbb Z \mathbb P$. It is only in the ring of Laurent polynomials with these coefficients the coprime condition happens. Note with this set up exchange polynomials which were the same before become distinct. What I have said isn't precise; so, see the article for the exact definitions. The important thing is you must go the universal coefficients because it may not be true in the original coefficients for exactly the reason you point out.
