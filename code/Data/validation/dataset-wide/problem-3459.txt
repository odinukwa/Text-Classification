The main reason differential topology had some success in economics is that supplies powerful methods to show that something holds generically, mainly Sard's theorem and the transversality theorem. Some of these methods have been generalized to contexts without differentiability, see for example the paper "A Prevalent Transversality Theorem for Lipschitz Functions" by Shannon. Differential topology is still used in general equilibrium theory, you might take a look at recent work of Yves Balasko. In positive political theory, there are results to the effect that generically no majority winner exists in multidimensional spatial voting models. A good introduction to this topic is the book "Positive Political Theory I" by Austen-Smith and Banks, the definitive treatment is the paper "The generic existence of a core for q-rules" by Saari. Inspired by the work on regular equilibria in general equilibrium theory, regular Nash equilibria were also studied in game theory, starting with Harsanyi. An elegant approach can be found in the paper "The theory of normal form games from the differentiable viewpoint" by Ritzberger (preprint here). Many genericity results in general equilibrium have corresponding versions in game theory, for example, "most" normal form games have a finite and odd number of Nash equilibria. Another area where differential topology is used is in the study of stability with respect to some dynamics. Indeed, one can define regular equilibria via the replicator dynamic from evolutionary game theory (that is how Ritzberger does it). For a recent example of using some differential topology (index theory, treat also in more generality), see the working paper "The Index +1 Principle" by McLennan. 

A continuous, transitive, complete, convex, and locally non-satiated preference on an open convex subset $V$ of some $\mathbb{R}^l$ has an $r$-times continuously differentiable utility representation with no critical points if and only if the space $I=\{(x,y)\in V\times V\mid x\sim y\}$ is a $C^r$-manifold. This result is essentially Proposition 2.3.9. in the book "The Theory of General Economic Equilibrium: A Differentiable Approach" by Andreu Mas-Colell. Actually, the result there replaces convexity of $V$ and the preference relation to be represented by the weaker condition that all indifference curves are connected. I'm not aware of any more elementary approach to the problem. 

A few years ago I was reading The Economist and I remember it stated a particular academic paper that underpinned the rationale for the existence of private equity firms. I have tried to find this article but have had no success. I believe this paper justified why companies are run better privately. Does anyone know what this paper is/might of been? 

I am looking for a good book to explain to me why the gold standard existed and why in the Bretton Woods conferences, some countries choose to abandon it. An explanation of the general scenario in a historical setting would also be greatly appreciated. 

I was reading that Japan has a debt to gdp ratio of 240pc and I cannot understand why this has not left the country "bankrupt"? From looking at this like an ordinary person this level would be completely unmanageable. Furthermore, considering Greece had problems with its national debt with a debt to gdp ratio of less than 200pc I am not sure how Japan has sustained significantly higher ratio for so long? Therefore my question is what makes a certain level of debt to gdp ratio sustainable? Also who does the government owe the debt to and does it matter who they borrow from? ie domestic vs international. For interest see the following graph, 

I have been reading recently on the quantitative easing programmes by the ECB and the BOJ, see $URL$ and, $URL$ The ECB will be expanding its current programme to include corporate bonds and it is being suggested that the BOJ may give up on negative interest rates and possibly could buy japanese equities instead. It seems that these central banks are just working their way up the risk asset spectrum. My question is where do these asset buying programmes stop (penny stocks/distressed debt?)? Also what happens to these assets, surely if they sit on the central banks books it could go bankrupt like a commercial bank? Moreover, what could cause these asset buying programmes to be abandoned/fail? 

In the example, both consumers have even quasi-linear preferences, which are (necessarily for nonuniqueness) linear in different commodities. 

For every action of player 2 that is played with positive probability, the conditional distribution over player 1's actions is an optimal strategy for player 1 and vice versa. Since optimal strategies are unique in RPS, the conclusion follows. 

Yes, this has been studied. Look up "matching with contracts" and the earlier papers by Crawford & Knoer (1981), and Kelso & Crawford (1982) in Econometrica. 

Let $G$ be the cumulative distribution function for the buyers' willingness to pay. If there is no cost, expected profit is simply expected revenue. The revenue is quantity times price. If the unit of the good is actually sold, this is just the price. Now the probability that the good is sold at price $p$ is the probability that the willingness to pay is not smaller than $p$, which is $\big(1-G(p)\big)$. So in total, expected profit is simply $$\big(1-G(p)\big)p.$$ Two things are implicit in the problem already: First, the willingness to pay already includes all relevant aspects of the buyer's income. Moreover, unless we have the willingness to pay for each amount of the commodity, it is likely that the expected quantitty is a unit quantity of $1$. 

It depends on what you want from a representative agent. What you get is a representative agent at the given prices. For any two commodities, you have relative prices. This is where market completeness comes in. All you have to do now is find a well-behaved utility function whose marginal rate of substitution between the commodities corresponds to the relative prices. You can even take the utility function to be linear: $$u(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_l)=\sum_{i=1}^l x_i/p_i.$$ Of course, the resulting "representative agent" is utterly useless for any comparative statics exercise or any welfare analysis. 

A price-taking firm takes prices as given, but that does not mean that the firm cannot influence prices; it just means that the firm ignores its own impact on prices. Now the question is how sensible it is to assume that firms take prices as given. The usual view is that it is a reasonable assumption when the impact of a firm on prices is small enough that profit-maximizing behavior for given prices does not differ much from profit-maximization under actual prices. This is usually the case if there are many firms that are small relative to the market. There are various ways to make this precise. One can also work with models with a continuum of firms in which a single firm hs literally no impact on prices. As a side remark, Steve Keen's book reveals a strange mixture of incompetence and dishonesty. Keen is ignorant of basic calculus. Keen, sometimes with coauthors, has come up with a nonsensical theory of the firm. Here is a note by Paulin Anglin pointing out several of the many problems. One of these problems is acknowledged here. Later, Keen (and Standish) wrote a survey of Keen's history of criticising the theory of the firm in which they did not acknowledge Anglin's criticism. I recommend reading books from people with higher scholarly standards than Keen.
