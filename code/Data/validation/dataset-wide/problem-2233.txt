If you are playing against anyone experienced, there is never anything wrong with serving it hard at them, they should expect it. 

The above remains correct after checking the most credible source I could find, but FYI here's the link to what I believe are the official rules: $URL$ -- Check the link on the left for A Let. 

Thus, after a block, the blocking team, or the attacking team, are entitled to three team hits to return the ball. 

If the man on 2nd decides to not run to third, then he would only be out by one of those two options. It's only a force if you tag the base the runner is required to go to by rule. 3B's claim is incorrect; the runner on 2nd made the correct decision -- he "made the best of the situation". 

There's not going to be anything really governing 'serving hard' as ethical or not ethical. I played volleyball for 6 years, so I eventually had a pretty good serve as well. In PE class, or at parties (4th of July, etc.) that tend to have a volleyball net up, I would rather do Float Serves instead of just a power serve/ jump serve. It's less cocky looking, and when done right can really mess with your opponent a lot more than a brute force serve -- think of what it looks like when a knuckleball pitcher fools the batter. Not many people in PE classes or Parties have played volleyball a lot, but rarely you can identify your "rival" (someone else who plays volleyball :P), and you and that person can set up the teams so you serve to each other. Plus, people who don't know how to properly bump the ball will start to get really painful forearms: redness and sore arms - which is kind of mean. Of course, underhand serve, or overhand bloop serve it to people who: 

See this page with Table Tennis rules. Specifically there are two rules to be read here. First, a legal serve is defined as: 

How many do play in the NHL? The roster consists of 25 players total for the Russian Men's National ice hockey team. Of those 25 players, 16 of them are in the NHL. The remaining 9 play in the Russian Superleague (KHL). 

Information on record scorers by country is available on Wikipedia. With the table sorted by Goal scoring ratio, the highest goals per international game meeting the minimum national caps is listed below: Min. 100 Caps: 

Does the player who delivers a corner kick to the box get an assist if the ball is scored directly from the kick? If not, how come they don't get an assist? 

If, after ranking the teams based on the criteria described in A, B and C, there still at least two teams that are equal (i.e., there is no distinct winner of the group yet), those teams then need to be compared further to determine the top team in the group. Example: Team 1, Team 2, Team 3, Team 4 are in a group, After the group stage finishes, you evaluate all four teams against A, B and C. If the criteria of those three rules has not determined a single group winner -- say Team 1 and Team 2 are tied based on A, B and C's criteria -- then the teams (Team 1 and 2, referred to as the teams concerned) need to be further evaluated by d, then E, then f, then g, if necessary. 

The safety is usually the last line of defense, and like the middle linebacker, must be versatile. He will have coverage responsibilities, yet must also be prepared to provide run support if a running back or quarterback has gotten past the linebackers. However, the middle linebacker, being close to the line, will often set defensive formations and call audibles to counter tendencies that he's spotted. The safety also perform that function for the defensive secondary, but might be too far away to make adjustments to the seven players in the defensive front. 

Currently, the NCAA limits teams to 85 scholarships. The teams may recruit any number of scholarship quarterbacks. In addition, teams can also invite players to walk-on, so there are likely to be more than 3 quarterbacks on each team's roster. There is a cap of 105 players on a roster for Division 1 FBS teams: 

Each topic had several practical pointers and tips. One table tennis forum post dealt with this question and had two suggestions: 

The main reason for a team to involve itself in a trade is to acquire a benefit in one of these areas: 

In high school, virtually all of the distance runners that I've observed used regular running shoes. However, elite level distance runners all seem to use track spikes. Have there been any studies that have quantified the benefits of using track spikes versus regular running shoes in longer distance track and field events (I'm thinking 1500+ meter/1+ mile)? 

As Rory mentioned, practice will help - this technique is considered to be fairly advanced. Repetition is needed to perfect your technique. If you want some additional training tips, one site suggests: 

The author notes that his group starts off practicing on small snow bumps, before graduating to a 10-meter ramp and ending at an 18-meter ramp. You will need to be comfortable with downhill skiing (in a straight line at high speeds) in order to have enough momentum for good jumps. If you're starting out on the smaller beginner's ramps, multiple jumps per day shouldn't be too tough on the body (depending on your physical condition). 

Finally, there are anecdotal stories about the increase in young athletes getting injured at higher rates due to sports specialization. One article discusses some of the dangers of specializing in sports at an early age, while another article quotes Pittsburgh Steelers safety Troy Polamalu: 

In the blog post titled "More evidence for referee bias in soccer," Phil Birnbaum points to two studies related to European football - in the Spanish and German leagues. He notes: 

The article also pointed to some other resources. The one article (from Best Hockey Drills) listed these drills: 

According to this training article, bricks are commonly bike/run combos, but there there are also training scenarios for swim/bike combos. 

Since Manning has more than four years of experience and therefore vested, the waiver rules don't apply to him. His release is considered "official" once the associated paperwork clears the process mentioned in Marcus Swope's post. 

Gail Imber notes in his article "Referee Bias: Quantifying the Homer Effect and Officiating Home-Field Advantage": 

A few games ago Clayton Kershaw of the Dodgers scooped up a bunt down the first base line and pegged the runner square in the back who was just running straight down the baseline like anyone would. The runner didn't otherwise in any way impede the defensive players, it was just a mistaken throw that hit the runner. But the runner was immediately called out. The first baseman never touched the ball. Everyone including the announcers just understood it to be an out. Why? If a catcher throws down to second base to get a guy trying to steal, and the ball hits the runner, he is not automatically out. If the guy in right field throws a ball to third base and hits the runner sliding into third, he is not automatically out. What then is the reasoning and rule that allows the guy running to first to be out? [Edit: keywords so this information can be found: "45-foot lane", "runner's lane"] 

For the last-half of the distance to first base, a runner should not step inside the foul line, for if a fielder makes a throw parallel down the line to first, it is construed that the runner is interfering with pay. There is a second chalk line, along the first base line, called the 45-foot line for just this purpose, defining the 3-foot wide runner's lane a runner must be within. 

Yeah, with a ”time play”. Scenario: Bases loaded, one out. The batter hits a short-hop to the second baseman, who tags second base to get out #2, then he throws to home (because he gets confused, or thinks he can't turn the double play at first) but it's a wild throw and the run scores. The catcher gathers the ball and then throws back to second base because the batter is trying to get there and he throws him out for out #3 just before the runner originating from second base crosses home plate. This would be a 'time play' and the first run would count and the second would not. 

All 30 parks. Make assumptions. I'm thinking if the Right Field value is quite a bit lower, THAT is the reason why left handed hitters “hit better” with low and inside pitches – something announcers oft repeat over the decades but no one has ever yet explained why (in my experience) and the interwebs are withholding the information just to mess with us, so we'll have to solve it for ourselves. 

“Hitting the wall”, or "pinging" is colloquial for having your heart rate bouncing off your Max Heart Rate (MHR). Being overly out of breath and head-dizzy are symptoms. “Bonking” is colloquial for when your muscles run out of glucose-etc. Your entire body aching – especially your shoulders – is a symptom. These are two very distinct feelings; but are somewhat interrelated. Sounds like you're suffering from the first. In my experience the first can start to happen more dramatically (noticeably) as you get older – “older” as in 36yo mind you : / I had the first example above happen so bad one time in Santa Cruz that I had to get off my bike and walk. I had had plenty of food, and absolutely knew myself – I knew I wasn't bonking and couldn't understand what was happening to me – but I pushed too hard for too long to try and keep up with an amazing athlete on a hill climb. This is colloquially called “exploding”. You see it all the time in professional bike races during hard climbing events. Once you “explode” you can't recover while still providing output to the bike. This happens easier as you get older – even though you think you are at exactly the same (or better) physical condition. A third thing is ”heat exhaustion”. This is a whole 'nother animal, and the most dangerous of the lot. I've explored the depths of these three failure points quite a few times. It's good to know where they are, but to be sure, one day you may “take it to the next level” and be completely shocked by what your body is doing,even though you think you understand what these things are... You need a heart rate monitor, and to review the breadcrumb heart rate data for a race on your computer and see exactly what your heat is doing when you feel that way. The numbers will be clear as day. Or you can just look at your wrist/stem when riding and SEE you're “pinging” off your MHR – and if you stay there for long, you'll feel that “explosion” coming - irretrievably out of breath and often dizziness. “That's rodeo” as far as bicycle racing (sans downhill, in most cases) – scrunching up against a predetermined heart/work rate and staying there. The way this feels, as far as work output, can vary widely – hugely in fact – depending on altitude, food, sickness and countless other things – and especially nerves – but the numbers don't lie as far as optimizing your output. Hope that helps. Be careful. Genetic predisposition for heart problems may onset. A full checkup may be required – even if you're only 40-some years old. People die from heat attacks in their 40s – even athletes. EDIT: One final thought – as a runner you probably understand clearly the notion of stride length. How extending your stride just slightly can drastically increase your speed for basically the same amount of work. And like rowing, or swimming, where getting that extra “reach” - even an inch – can really make all the difference in the world for max top-speed. I see breathing as exactly the same – especially road racing. Take a big breath right now. Then take another breath and exaggerate the total input – EXPAND the lungs. THAT right there – training yourself to do that all the time when riding at your predetermined heart rate, will effectively be like having the extra few inches of “reach”. If you ride hard enough long enough – training – you just naturally acquire it. But understanding what the desired end-state condition “looks like”, can really help you get there ..faster. When you “explode”, as I've call it, that whole process of breathing is out of sync with your body. To try best to work through an explosion in a race is exactly – precisely – directly – the art of breathing big and consistent, even though your body is saying you really don't need to – because it's overloaded and wants to make you slow the F' down.... it's making you hyperventilate with shorter 25% quick breaths. 

In a 4-3 defense, there are two defensive tackles (DT) in the interior of the line, while in a 3-4 defense, there is only one tackle - the nose tackle. Usually, the primary task of the nose tackle is to occupy more than one blocker in the interior of the line to allow linebackers to make plays. In contrast, the role of 4-3 tackles depends heavily on the design of the defense - some 4-3 DT's are pass rushers (example: Warren Sapp) while others also occupy blockers in more of a run-defense role. Vincent Wilfork is listed as an example of a 3-4 Nose Tackles in this Pat Kirwan article on nfl.com. In the same article, Pat Williams is listed as an example of a 4-3 nose tackle. The article describes the roles of these two types of nose tackles: 

There may be products that can help improve reaction time if you're willing to purchase tools - the Newgy Robo-Pong claims to support a variety of drills to improve reaction time for table tennis. (CAVEAT: I've never used this product, so can't determine whether it performs as promised). Finally, this article suggests that visual acuity is closely associated with good reaction times in many sports - make sure that your vision is good (lasik, glasses, contacts, etc.). 

You'll need to incorporate weight training and/or intervals in order to maintain (or increase) your muscle mass. A blog post titled "The Running Body Builder" offers some tips: 

Yes, tanking has happened in the NBA. In fact, a notorious tanking example was one of the causes of the draft lottery being instituted in the first place. This ESPN article notes: 

Runner's World also had an article discussing the benefits of cross-training from a runner's perspective that may apply to other sports as well: 

Per this BBC article, the athletes will receive medals that were stripped from the banned competitors: 

A recent example is the three team trade involving Golden State, New Orleans, and Philadelphia. The original trade involved only two teams, with Golden State trading Dorrell Wright to Philadelphia for an overseas player to obtain cap relief - essentially a salary dump. New Orleans wanted to obtain salary relief, and so joined the trade by sending Jarret Jack to Golden State and getting the overseas player in return. Each team got something from this transaction: 

The challenge of hitting smaller targets with a smaller bat should improve one's hand-eye coordination for all ball-striking sports. For a tennis specific drill, one instructor used the following technique: 

I think the same factors are in play for both college and professional leagues. At the end of this article, the writer notes that: 

According to this cbafaq.com page, NBA payroll rules can vary by the player's contract, within limits stipulated by the CBA: 

Cross-training provides two potential benefits, one mental and one physical. It can potentially reduce the risk of injury and, as others have already mentioned, it can provide some mental benefit by reducing boredom and burnout through different physical activities. As this article notes:
