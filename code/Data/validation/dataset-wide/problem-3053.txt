The Supreme court is currently considering a case about cake baking that is based on public access clauses that restrict free speech - the question is whether baking a cake constitutes an artistic expression (which is to say "speech", or whether it is a commercial endeavor.) 

The question is anachronistic. (which is why this will be another answer where I fall short of my goal of providing sources/references). On the other hand, most of this is in the wikipedia article. The delegates to the Continental Congress honestly believed that what unified them (a belief that monarchy was not necessary and that citizens of a republic could govern themselves) was much more important than what divided them. They believed that men who "disinterested" (Gordon Wood points out that Franklin sold off all his business interests before entering public life - (the claim doesn't hold up to strict scrutiny, but Franklin and his contemporaries believed it)) would automatically seek out and advance the public good. The notion that their commitment to the public good might be contaminated by faction or party would have challenged their fundamental beliefs and probably would have been an insult. Side-note - the terms "Federalist" and "Anti-Federalist" which we today view as quasi-party labels were almost never used at the time. To the extend that they were used, they were accusations that someone was functionalist and political. I can't cite anything specific, but I believe that Pauline Meier's History of the constitution covers this. Having said that, the Jay treat clearly reveals the tensions of the age. Northern commercial interests were willing to yield navigation rights on the Mississippi to European interests, while Southern farming interests were horrified by the prospect. The South was deeply anti-commercial, pro-farming and pro-slavery. They were bound together by the thinnest political veneer. Washington's personal authority maintained that veneer through his Presidency, but after his departure, things began to fall apart. 

Other answers have noted the difficulties. I"m going to draw an arbitrary distinction between a charismatic cult and a religion. (yes, that distinction is difficult, which is why I'm calling the distinction "arbitrary"). If we exclude charismatic cults, then I'd hazard that the last religion to become extinct are the Amana I strongly suspect that there are later candidates, but I'm not aware of any . 

Legitimate government is very important to the Chinese - they have had continuous legitimate government for longer than anyone else. I'd hazard that they've had legitimate government for longer than all of Europe combined. The next level of hairy details Note: I'm not taking a position - I'm trying to explain the article text. Obviously there are many sides with different viewpoints. 

Williamsburg note that this was not an employer/employee relationship, but barter between merchants Whiskey is a natural medium of exchange for barter. It is stable, divisible and transports well. Why wouldn't you pay in whiskey? Update: @Samuel Russell points out that I neglected to address the nearly pathological fear of scrip in the new colonies. I thought I had mentioned that, but I see that I did not. Then I tried to find good sources to explore the topic, and I can't (yet) find any that are succinct. 

Hat tip to @BrianZ who summarized it well; this is a research opportunity. There are a couple of sources that might serve as seeds for research, but there does not seem to be a common agreement about the right to bear arms in English law. The best citation I've found is the following: 

An open city is not contested; the city government declares that they have no intention of resisting the occupier. 

I suppose one could argue that they had "freedom from want", because of the grain dole, but I would have trouble making that argument with a straight face. 

The original image is in the British Museum it is an Elmes print, published by Tegg in 1813. The page referenced also contains links to related cartoons. Williamsburg VA has a selection of cartoons about the US revolution for independence, including a discussion of the "macaroni" in Yankee Doodle. The Library of Congress has a teacher's guide to the history of American Political Cartoons The image isn't very clear, but the earliest cartoon that I personally remember is one that depicts Charles I's execution - not what we think of as a traditional cartoon subject 

First, a caveat; religion isn't like Height or Eye Color - you can't measure it. And "religious leaders" don't have a position, they have a constellation of positions. Criteria #3 is, in my opinion, useless; any discussion of #3 is purely about opinion; there is no way to determine what an individual's metaphysical belief might be at any given moment. Religious belief isn't quantitative. I would argue that every single leader (religious or political) in history has religious beliefs and preferences that society does not share (that's why they call them "leaders" - because they differ from the herd; if you believe exactly the same as society, then there is no need for change). Second this is an "example question" - which are generally bad fits for H:SE. Pretty much every political ruler during the reformation is an example, as is every political figure from approximately 100 to 300. You are ignoring the impact of the state church. Having said that, you've alluded to some examples: 

The same source points out that tax farming supplanted tax collection by 167 BCE The government privatized the collection of taxes, and sold the privilege to the high bidder. Absent a solid census, the first system was prone to missing taxes and the second system was prone to mind numbing corruption and oppression. In the early Empire, Augustus returned to direct taxation 

I found two Judeo-Christian sources that suggest the tradition predates the modern codification of the Old Testament. 

The gens originally held a governance function, then that governance function was absorbed into Roman governance. After the Imperial period, the functions were no longer relevant. There was no reason to maintain the lineage, and the "notable families" bred back into the general populace. With respect to Latin surnames, I don't have any data on the distribution of surnames, so I don't know if Latin surnames are under-represented. If I were to hazard a guess, I suspect that after the fall of Rome, the prestige of a Latin surname vanished, and I would expect that today Latin surnames are probably similar to other ethnic surnames in distribution - but that is merely a hypothesis and I don't have data to test it. Update: Even when Rome controlled Europe, only a minority of the population would have had a nomen. I cannot cite a source, but I believe that the majority of nomen were from the Urban Tribes, and therefore would not have been "notable". The governor of a province and his staff probably had patrician nomen; the inhabitants of the province probably did not. Again, a hypothesis, but I would be surprised to find surnames derived from nomen anywhere other than Italy, Byzantium and possibly Spain/Portugal. 

Both. First off, address the bias. There is a substantial fraction of historians who think that Napoleon's armpits smelled like air freshener and posies sprung up in his footsteps. They believe that the word "wrong" is defined as "disagrees with Napoleon", and discussing Napoleon's failings is not just an intellectual but also a moral hazard. I'm not fond of these folks. Napoleon isn't a single, easily understood instance, he's a generation, and over that generation he changes and he changes the world. He rejects the church, he accepts the church. He frees all slaves, and then re-enslaves the ones he finds necessary. He enfranchies the Jews and then reveals that the enfranchisement doesn't really mean much. He writes the code Napoleon, and then rules as a dictator. I don't like him; I don't like the revolution, I don't like absolutism, I don't like conquering populism. The problems he confronts are fascinating, but I can't read about him because too many historians think the Napoleonic war is about Napoleon. I say all that as preface because I have to admit that Napoleon is brilliant by any concievable standard. As a military genius he did things that everyone else in Europe would have agreed were impossible. There are precious few rulers who have singlehandedly written a law code for an entire continent. That law code fell short of his goals, but judged by his aspirations, even I have to admit it is pretty admirable. He was quite simply more capable than anyone around him, and was still able to motivate others to join and support his cause. The ancien regime was screwed - they had been trying assiduously to reform for at least a generation, but were unable to make the changes that would have saved themselves. Whether you think Napoleon was the agent of the change or a tool of change, he wasn't simply a lucky guy in the right place. He was an incredibly brilliant, incredibly capable man who rode the malestrom. I think you pose a very good question - it would be fascinating to compare absolutist rulers like Stalin, Franco and Napoleon and investigate how they deployed terror, governance and genius to reform their societies.
