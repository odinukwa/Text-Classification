ExRX is a good resource for exercises with short video clips for different muscles. However, nothing beats spending time with a trainer to learn proper form. 

The BOSU ball (or half ball) is used in rehab and fitness training for a variety of reasons. Balancing on the disc while doing movements, activities and exercise engages the nervous system to fine-tune muscle control which improves or controls joint positioning. This is particularly important in rehabilitation where the joint position sense* has been compromised due to injury. 

Break up prolonged sitting throughout your day to negate the negative health consequences. And when you are ready to start an exercise program, you'll find lots of info here or just ask more questions. Also, this site does not address diet, but what you eat and how much you eat are important. 

(as long as you are getting your complete proteins with every meal). He also has an article about milk (and chocolate milk) as part of your body recomposition program. 

I doubt that your back pain with jogging will go away unless you specifically address the cause. When you jog on an alignment problem, whether it is your foot/ankle/knee/hip/pelvis or spine, the impact of each step aggravates the problem. The more steps you take, the worse the problem becomes. It is to your advantage to have an evaluation of your back, posture, lower extremity alignments, muscle weakness/tightness as well as a running analysis, preferably by a sports physical therapist. @Richard has given you some good ideas about how orthotics, core strengthening and running form can address alignment problems. Your problems may be the same or different, so it is worth having a pro take a look at you and give you specific recommendations. If you don't have access to a running evaluation, you may want to try Chi Running. It is a running technique designed to reduce or prevent injuries and to improve your running efficiency. The technique addresses flexibility, stride, posture, cadence, breathing, body awareness and feedback. You can learn the Chi Running technique from their book and dvd from their site. Or you can get just the book on Amazon. (If you get the book from Amazon I'd appreciate it if you use the link on our site.) The best way to learn is by attending one of their workshops. If you try the above suggestions and still can't run without causing back pain, some other options are jogging in water with or without resistance bands, cycling, using an elliptical trainer or using nordic walking poles. The buoyancy of the water reduces the amount of weight compressing your joints and spine. The elliptical trainer and cycling also reduce or eliminate impact. The nordic walking poles engage your trunk muscles, reduce impact and improve your back alignment. Good luck. Let us know how it goes. 

The key is being regular. Convenience, positive feedback and doing something you enjoy will help you keep more regular with your exercises. Also, having a partner or exercise buddy can help you keep going when you don’t want to exercise. 

George Mateljan in the World’s Healthiest Foods, lists sunflower seeds and swiss chard as sources of excellent quality Vitamin E. Using his rating system, an excellent rating has a daily value percentage of over 75% and a nutrient density (based on total nutrient richness) score over 7.6 Almonds and spinach are rated very good. Collard greens, kale, papaya, olives, bell peppers, brussels sprouts, kiwi, blueberries, tomatoes and broccoli are listed as good. Additionally, he writes that Vitamin E is a family of fat soluble vitamin. Food sources contain the full spectrum ( alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-trocopherols and tocotrienols). Supplements generally contain only a synthetic di-alpha tocopherol. Vitamin E is partially processed out of wheat/wheat germ with commercial processing. He recommends storing oils (olive, sunflower, peanut) air tight to protect their vitamin E. His site gives recipes noting ways to prepare and cook to optimize vitamins. 

Craneflat, I partially agree with @eych about resting. The body likes breaks. But I understand that you are on a roll and don’t want an interruption. For indoors when it rains, bodyweight circuits can give you a good cardio workout. The problem with many bodyweight routines is that they involve some moves like jumps and lunges, that are hard on recovering knees as you mentioned. (Even Mountain Climbers may aggravate a knee problem going from full flexion to extension and you don’t want a knee flare up to mess with your hiking.) Here is a bodyweight cardio circuit workout to give you an idea of alternating upper and lower body exercises as well as opposing muscles so that you rest one muscle group while exercising another. The video does have squats and lunges that are hard on the knees, but you can substitute with other bodyweight exercises. If you have enough resistance bands, or suspension bands like the TRX, you can do squats and lunges with some support to at least partially protect your knees. Also, if you alternate your resistance band exercises using minimal breaks you can get a cardio interval workout. You can do 20 seconds on with 10 second rest intervals for the Tabata protocol as @Waquo mentioned. Here is an example of using the TRX with 40 second/20 second workouts. You could also consider a pair of Nordic walking poles for your hiking. They will transfer some of the weight off of your knees, and you’ll use more of your core muscles, lats, abs etc. each time you plant the pole, turning your hiking into a full body workout. I managed to get some good workouts on an Alaskan ferry doing functional exercises with my resistance bands attached to the berths, so you’ll do fine in a cabin with your bands and heart rate monitor. Have a fun vacation and congratulations on your progress, determination and commitment! 

Try any of those to see if it makes a difference. Build up slowly and cool off with a cool shower afterwards. If those don't make a difference, check with your doctor. Heat can be a trigger for some people who have migraines. Also it may not just be a factor of the heat and hydration, it may be the type of sauna that is affecting you. Check on the type of sauna you are using - "wet vs dry", or "conventional vs infrared". 

Addressing Fat Loss after Pregnancy You have already been directed to the info that Robert cited so I will just add: 

Not exactly. However, below are 2 studies looking at grapefruit consumed prior to meals. They look at weight loss, as well as health factors like cholesterol and insulin resistance. (Note: these are not what is typically thought of as the "grapefruit diet".) 

Depends - If you tend to sit for prolonged periods without moving, sitting on an exercise ball (for part of the time) can help by giving you a more dynamic posture as your trunk muscles make frequent adjustments. I think of the effect as improving muscle control, so in that respect you could say it is strengthening your core and postural muscles. For me, sitting on an exercise ball keeps me from slumping. I sit with a better posture and I feel that I have some carry over when I sit in my regular chair. I only use my ball intermittently. Some down sides of using an exercise ball as a desk chair: 

• VMO Strengthening - Start with simple quad sets, placing your hand on your VMO for feedback. Tapping on the muscle can also help to facilitate a better muscle contraction. Progress to closed kinetic chain (weight bearing) exercises like split squats, 

Since you aren't worried about your weight, measure your percentage of body fat to track your progress. Seeing improvements will keep you motivated to go a little farther. Congratulations for getting started. As you improve the way you look and feel you will also be a good role model for your child. Best of luck. 

The short answer is that you find someone who specializes in analyzing static and dynamic postures and movements and have them give you program to follow to correct any areas of dysfunction. The more information and knowledge that you have, the more able you will be to find the practitioner that can meet your needs. Here are some ideas: 

Side Plank - To save your wrists you can brace yourself on your elbow and forearm, rather than on your hand. Yoga - Given your lax or unstable joints, I would take a private lesson from a good yoga instructor to get modifications and to improve your alignments. Ask for postures or asanas that emphasize stability of the shoulder blade and strengthen the shoulders rather than emphasising flexibility. An instructor who teaches restorative yoga will probably be your best choice. If you have enough control with the overhead arm positions you could stop short of the position that causes your joints to dislocate or sublux. The one thing you don't want to do is increase your joint instablility by continuing to repeat activities that cause them to dislocate. This will just stress your ligaments and tendons. Good luck. 

From Tai Chi studies, I’ve learned that in the West we spend a lot of time in our heads, thinking in our overstimulated world and are less in touch with our bodies and its sensations. We can reduce our stress by draining our attention out of our heads and becoming more mindful of our bodies. That is why many stress reduction techniques focus on the breath. Your question is asking for an academic answer to solve your “feeling” of stress. By searching for studies to tell you how long and how often to run to reduce your physiologic markers of stress, you are overlooking the most direct answer, “to run until you feel your stress release.” While I know that this is not the answer that you are looking for, it may be the most direct way for you to reduce your stress and achieve your goal. ChiRunning’s article, Stress Reduction Made Easy, describes their “fun run” as a way of running to reduce stress. It suggests to run without a plan, without speed, and without time limit “until you sense the need in your body to head back.” How long? “It doesn't matter as long as you're enjoying being in your body and not in your head.” 

Are you in denial? Yes, in my opinion, you are. Given that, "More than two-thirds (68.8 percent) of adults are considered to be overweight or obese." according to NIH, you may be comparing yourself with similarly overweight people. Step one is to decide that you want to change. Here are some additional suggestions for getting started on a new plan: Starting Exercise, Types of Exercise 

then holding heavy bags of groceries for progressively long periods of time would be your most direct path. This not only trains the specific muscles for the task, but it trains them in the same position where the strength is needed, and with the type of contraction needed for the the task. 

I think you'll find this article by Tom Venuto interesting esp. since you want to gain muscle and lose fat at the same time which is basically what his book, Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle is about. It is a long article that discusses proteins, and food vs supplements. In general, he writes that: 

Your BMI at 36 places you in the Class 2 classification of obesity. Change your unhealthy habits to healthy habits such as: 

According to your height and weight, your BMI (Body Mass Index) is 19.6 which in the Normal Range. BMI is a good indicator of weight ranges, although not as accurate for very muscular people or for people with muscle wasting. Other parameters you may want to check are your body fat percentage and waist measurments (waist circumference - ~ 88.9 cm to 101.6 cm or less, waist to height ratio - 0.55 or less). If the numbers place you in a normal range, then you don't need to gain weight from a health standpoint. If you do want to gain, add lean muscle mass, not fat. 

Swim Outlet has a nice discussion on swim caps. Different swim cap materials for swimming include: latex, silicon or neoprene. For water jogging or water aerobics where your face and head are not necessarily in the water, they suggest that a lycra cap is cooler. For medium or long hair they recommend: 

3) Set up your Back Routine: Because you have already found that your back is responsive to stretching and strengthening exercises, you should respond well if you get the right combination of exercises. In addition to exercise there are other self treatment techniques you can ask your therapist about: 

There is a start to some of the changes taking place, but the full answer includes changes in muscle fibers, respiration, blood vessel elasticity, body composition etc. 

Both the gastronemius and the hamstrings cross the back of the knee joint, so both can be tight from sitting 10 hours per day. Muscles can tighten, but the fascia can also become stuck and stop gliding well. Hydration is important for fascial mobility. Here are some suggestions: 

Since you don’t have room for a bike, you won’t have room for an elliptical trainer which is usually a good way to burn calories and is easy on the knees. Rowing and boxing are good and have already been mentioned. 

Sounds like you are doing great; and no, you are certainly not wasting your time. The new physical activity guidelines according to the cdc say that you can break up your exercise into 10 minute workouts and still get the health benefits as long as you are getting at least 150 minutes (2.5 hrs.) per week of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise such as brisk walking. Once you are comfortable with the baseline of 2.5 hours per week, the new guidelines recognize greater health benefits with increasing your activity to 5 hours per week. The guidelines also include strength training (body weight exercises, resistance bands or weights) at least 2 times per week. You can cross train to give your knees a break while still getting your aerobic workout. For instance on some days you may want to do aquatic exercise, swim, cycle or use an elliptical trainer instead of your walk. Keep up the good work!

Night sweats can be related to an increase in exercise intensity due to the affect of exercise on the endocrine glands and hormone secreations. In general, excessive sweating at night is caused by hormones. That is why menopausal women are prone to night sweats. However, there are also several other causes, including medical or medication causes so night sweats may warrant a medical checkup in some cases. If you want objective information regarding the affect of increasing exercise intensity on the thyroid, see Neuroendocrinology Letters: Exercise Intensity and Its Effects on Thyroid Hormones referenced in this Livestrong article: Increased Exercise and Night Sweats 

Taking ibuprofen or other NSAIDs (anti-inflammatories that reduce pain and swelling) before for exercise can mask pain. Pain can be a warning sign to stop an exercise to prevent joint or soft tissue damage. Therefore, if you take it before exercise, you risk aggravating a problem.* However, if you have painful joints that prevent you from exercising, an anti-inflammatory medication taken before exercise may allow you to tolerate gentle exercise and gain the benefits of exercise. This would be a case for discussing its use with your doctor. Long term or regular use of ibuprofen has side effects. Side Effects and Warnings From Medline Plus side effects include: 

I would say that a stretching routine is something that should be personalized to be the most effective. To help you set up your own routine here are some suggestions. 

2) Find a Good Health Practitioner/Therapist: Since you currently have back pain that you are unable to eliminate, it is time to see a professional to evaluate the cause(s), treat any offending tissues (joints, muscles, fascia) and instruct you in specific exercises (stretching and strengthening) to correct imbalances.
