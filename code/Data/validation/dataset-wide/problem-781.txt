A sidereal year is 365.256363004 days (365 d 6 h 9 min 9.76 s). One of the well known Web calendars and date calculators is at: $URL$ Here is the result for your specific question 1/1/2017+1year = 1/1/2018. Adding exactly one year (on a calendar) gives you one year later, everything is the same except the 'year number'. 

Orbital resonances greatly enhance the mutual gravitational influence of the bodies, i.e. their ability to alter or constrain each other's orbits. In most cases, this results in an unstable interaction, in which the bodies exchange momentum and shift orbits until the resonance no longer exists. Under some circumstances, a resonant system can be stable and self-correcting, so that the bodies remain in resonance. The small effect of the volcanoes is corrected by the much greater effect of resonance. The website space.com estimates Io's age at about 4.5 billion years old, the same age as Jupiter. If the orbit was unstable and changing it may well have been destroyed long ago. 

If you want to include the effect of quantum gravity in your calculations a recent paper is: "Black body radiation in a model universe with large extra dimensions and quantum gravity effects" 8 Jan 2018, by Nozari, Anvari, and Sefiedgar 

Simple and incorrect answer: In Newtonian mechanics the gravitational field of a body depends only on its mass, not on it's rotation. If you go a bit further and assume that the spinning object has perfectly uniform density then it matters not whether it spins nor the direction. More precise answer: The Lense–Thirring effect is very small—about one part in a few trillion. To detect it, it is necessary to examine a very massive object, or build an instrument that is very sensitive. The non-static stationary distributions of mass–energy causes frame dragging resulting in mass–energy currents and what is known as gravitomagnetism. 

Without a lot of expensive equipment the best you can do is make a rough estimate. By incorrectly assuming that the light that you see describes the black body temperature of the object, by assuming that the system is in thermal equilibrium with itself and that the temperature within the system is spatially and temporally uniform, you can use Planck's law to calculate the spectrum. 

There's an amusing explanation here: Changing the rotational rate of a natural body, it's about this much (as far as most people are concerned): 

From @Pela's answer to: Why is there a difference between the cosmic event horizon and the age of the universe? - So in ~100M years the most distant light will reach us, from over 116M light years away.

By starting with a known source, and using a high quality format, you can find somewhere that makes huge prints, and end up with something that won't devalue your property. As an example, one place, wants $400 to create wallpaper. Shop around and check reviews if you only pay a couple of hundred bucks you'll probably be wasting a couple of hundred bucks; it depends upon what you want it to look like and most importantly how close you intend to view it. 

There's a newer paper than the one you linked to, using a longer baseline, with better results. See: "PSR B0329+54: Substructure in the scatter-broadened image discovered with RadioAstron on baselines up to 330,000 km" (13 Sept 2016), by Popov, Bartel, Gwinn, Johnson, Andrianov, Fadeev, Et al., the conclusion on page 8: 

This article from the PrimaLuce Lab's website: "Radio astronomy at school with SPIDER radio telescopes" explains backyard radio astronomy. Their 3M diameter SPIDER 500A's H142-One receiver has a 1.42 GHz superheterodyne type radiometer/ spectrometer, double conversion (type UP/DOWN) with 50 MHz bandwidth (RF=1.395MHz-1.445MHz) and 14-bit analog to digital converter. It has a spectrometer with 1024 channels (each 61 KHz) and is able to record many radio sources in the Universe, with a theoretical flow of at least 5 Jy. Price available upon request. Their SPIDER 230C Compact Radio Telescope measures 2.3 meters and is priced at U$16K, from what I can determine from reading the literature it features the same receiver and software; dish diameter and mount capacity being the only difference, along with beam width and sensitivity. The mesh on their dishes is good up to 5 GHz but the feedhorn normally supplied is for 1.42 GHz, I imagine that they are willing to do some amount of customization.

Short answer: It's 46.9B light years. Another Wikipedia page says: 46.6B light years. The experts above calculate 46.2. 

The published data isn't accurate enough to reach the confidence level you require. Prof. Wright of UCLA has a webpage about the age of the universe using actual age measurements, not estimates from cosmological models, but a more authoritative source would be NASA's Lambda Archive Team which has a page on $t_0$. There are many ways to tweak the values and make the calculation, the computed value is somewhat dependent of the exact cosmological model assumptions. Within the standard ΛCDM model framework, CMB measurements, combined with BAO and SNIa measurements of the expansion rate, are presently in agreement and tightly constrained. The gray vertical line, representing the weighted average of WMAP and Planck data points, is positioned at $t_0$ = 13.796 Gyr. This graphic from their website sums it up:

With a temperature of 10K the center frequency is 11 $\mu m$. That's the oversimplified (inaccurate) layperson's calculation. More accurate calculations are made by allowing for everything from: relative velocity, the composition of the object's atmosphere (and our own), the effect of distance, even other elements, upon the spectral distribution (short list). Consequently, after correcting for light travel time effects the response of the Balmer and optical helium lines should generally be strongest during low continuum luminosity states. Responsivity that depends upon photon flux and continuum state may explain a number of outstanding problems currently under investigation in broad line variability studies of these and other emission lines. [Abridged] Once calculations are made for the blackbody curve in accordance with Planck's law it is necessary to transpose that to Rayleigh–Jeans law which is applicable at large wavelengths (low frequencies) but strongly disagrees at short wavelengths (high frequencies) where Planck's law is more useful. See Wikipedia's "Comparison [of Rayleigh–Jeans law] to Planck's law". 

FiG. 1. Conformal diagram showing comoving distance, $R_0χ$ in Glyr, versus conformal time, $R_0τ /c$ in Gyr, for the case in which events A and B appear on opposite sides of the sky as seen from Earth (α = 180°). The observer sits at Earth at $χ = 0$ at the present conformal time $τ = τ0$. Light is emitted from A at ($χA, τA$) and from B at ($χB, τB$); both signals reach the Earth along our past lightcone at ($0,_{τ0}$). The past-directed lightcones from the emission events (red and blue for A and B, respectively) intersect at ($χAB, τAB$) and overlap for $0 < τ < τAB$ (purple region). For redshifts $z_A = 1$ and $z_B = 3$ and a flat ΛCDM cosmology with parameters given in Eq. (11), the events are located at comoving distances $R_{0χA} = 11.11$ Glyr and $R_{0χB} = 21.25$ Glyr, with emission at conformal times $R_{0τA}/c = 35.09$ Gyr and $R_{0τB}/c = 24.95$ Gyr. The past lightcones intersect at event AB at $R_{0χAB} = 10.14$ Glyr at time $R_{0τAB}/c = 13.84$ Gyr, while the present time is $R_{0τ0}/c = 46.20$ Gyr. Also shown are the cosmic event horizon (line separating yellow and gray regions) and the future-directed lightcones from events A and B (thin dashed lines) and from the origin (0,0) (thick dashed lines). In a ΛCDM cosmology like ours, events in the yellow region outside our current past lightcone are space-like separated from us today but will be observable in the future, while events in the gray region outside the event horizon are space-like separated from observers on Earth forever. Additional scales show redshift (top horizontal axis) and time as measured by the scale factor, $a(τ)$, and by proper time, $t$, (right vertical axis) as measured by an observer at rest at a fixed comoving location.

Jupiter's moon Io has a lot of volcanoes. A similar answer to your question is provided at Quora's question: "Could the eruptions of all the volcanoes on Earth simultaneously knock it off its rotation or change its orbit?". There are two differences: Eruptions on Io can reach escape velocity (2.558 km/s), and matter is subject to gravity as it is propelled away from the moon allowing some to escape and some to return; so it is a source of wobbling and rotational speed changes. "Jupiter's rocky moon Io is the most volcanically active world in the solar system, with hundreds of volcanoes, some erupting lava fountains dozens of miles (or kilometers) high. Io’s remarkable activity is the result of a tug-of-war between Jupiter's powerful gravity and smaller but precisely timed pulls from two neighboring moons that orbit farther from Jupiter – Europa and Ganymede. ... Orbit and Rotation Although Io always points the same side toward Jupiter in its orbit around the giant planet, the large moons Europa and Ganymede perturb Io's orbit into an irregularly elliptical one. Thus, in its widely varying distances from Jupiter, Io is subjected to tremendous tidal forces. These forces cause Io's surface to bulge up and down (or in and out) by as much as 330 feet (100 meters). Compare these tides on Io's solid surface to the tides on Earth's oceans. On Earth, in the place where tides are highest, the difference between low and high tides is only 60 feet (18 meters), and this is for water, not solid ground. Io's orbit, keeping it at more or less a cozy 262,000 miles (422,000 kilometers) from Jupiter, cuts across the planet's powerful magnetic lines of force, thus turning Io into a electric generator. Io can develop 400,000 volts across itself and create an electric current of 3 million amperes. This current takes the path of least resistance along Jupiter's magnetic field lines to the planet's surface, creating lightning in Jupiter's upper atmosphere. Surface The tidal forces generate a tremendous amount of heat within Io, keeping much of its subsurface crust in liquid form seeking any available escape route to the surface to relieve the pressure. Thus, the surface of Io is constantly renewing itself, filling in any impact craters with molten lava lakes and spreading smooth new floodplains of liquid rock. ...". The two-body problem explains how multiple interacting objects affect the orbit of each other. While the orbital eccentricity of Io is quite low (0.0041) the orbits of three of the Galilean moons (Ganymede, Europa and Io, excluding Callisto) have a 1:2:4 resonance. The "pushing" will act in periodic repetition to have a cumulative effect on the motion. 

Deviation of the wavefront from a blackbody spectrum and the processes that create them is reasonably well understood, the phases of the incoming wavefronts can be measured to enhance the directionality and reduce the distortion. Correlation of the different frequencies allows detection of even small amounts of distortion. See: "The evolution of CMB spectral distortions in the early Universe" (29 Sept 2011), by J. Chluba, R.A. Sunyaev and the Video: "Spectral distortions of the CMB and what we might learn about the early universe", by Jens Chluba, and "Science with CMB spectral distortions" (27 May 2014), by Jens Chluba. The method is explained in the paper "Cosmic Microwave Background constraint on residual annihilations of relic particles" (9 Aug 2000), by McDonald, Scherrer, and Walker, page 2:
