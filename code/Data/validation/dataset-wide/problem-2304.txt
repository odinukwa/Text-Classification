I don't know what makes you think climbing ropes are limited at 80m. They are produced in one very long strand and then cut to the sizes you find in the store. I agree 80m is the max for what is usually found in stores, but you can get 200m ropes or climbing rope by the meter. A random google hit (no affiliation): $URL$ A friend of mine owns a 200m half-rope, so I also have first hand evidence that something like this exists ;) And even if they weren't generally available, those guys are usually sponsored by gear manufacturers, so it wouldn't be hard for them to get an extra long rope for extra marketable route send. 

I would always prefer the half-rope method, its the fastest and save. And the additional weight should not be an issue, after all you are three climbers. If you really do not want to handle two ropes (though it is very easy, just try it out) I would recommend the method using one single rope. The last method is really just in case you need the rope length, and both your partners struggle with the grade you are using or you are insecure handling two ropes (again, thats a none-issue). And keep in mind: You are always a lot slower in a three person rope team than with two. 

Disclaimer: I don't use whippets and have never even hold one in my own hands. From the build of a whippet and a question about whippets on AAI (provided by Ben Crowell) it has a very narrow use case: Difficult skiing terrain, where holding an ice-axe significantly decreases stability and thus increases chances to fall, and well known terrain and conditions. Well know terrain and conditions is very important, as whippets can only help to quickly arrest when you slip, but they can't fulfill other requirements of an ice-axe: Building a T-anchor, plunging and ascending on ice (at least it is only of limited help there). If you are sure that these factors (and probably more that I forgot) are not an issue on your specific tour, you can leave behind the ice-axe. So for your use case of a glacier tour over several days it is certainly not a replacement, as you need the ability to build a t-anchor to get someone out of a crevasse. And unless you plan to ski very difficult and hard packed sections, it is probably not worth taking them as an addition. And as to whether to take one or two whippets: If you take whippets, you probably want two. Otherwise you had to swap them whenever you make a turn in descent. 

To appease the (correctly) security minded: Just don't forget the second helmet ;) This depends on the specific situation in the crag: 

Because the characteristic of a backpack in question is volume or how much content it can hold, not mass. An extreme example: If I fill lead into a 20l pack, I get ~225kg, if I fill styropor into a 50l pack, I get about 2.5kg. Mass is still specified sometimes to give the empty mass of a pack. You might want to specify max loaded mass as either a limit for what the backpack can structurally take without taking damage or a limit for what the carrying system (shoulder, hip straps) are designed for. But these are different concerns and both are very imprecise. Maybe the max load without the pack taking damage could be estimated and the producer could recommend a max load to be carried with the pack, but as with any "soft manufacturer recommendations", that wouldn't be much help, as the human carrying the weight will be the limit. 

So whenever walking on easy terrain with moderate pack, use shoes . The walking is more ergonomic and they are lighter. On the other hand whenever technical stuff like obviously any mountaineering, rock scrambling, walking extensively on loose ground (scree) or on snow/ice and when walking with heavy load you certainly want boots. Here in the first cases the chance of a misstep and in the second one the consequences are too bad and ankle support ways out the disadvantages by far. Where it gets tricky is in between, the most typical case is multipitch climbing in alpine terrain where you have to carry anything (so your shoes/boots) up the route. You usually have quite some gear to carry (but not like tons) and the approach to the climb is somewhat rough but not technical. While ankle support certainly wouldn't hurt the additional weight and size are a pain while climbing. To judge what to take in such a situation requires either knowledge of the path you will be walking or experience. And the conclusion will be that there is not one, or two, maybe not even three models to fit all scenarios. The more you are out there the more justifiable it will be to have several models: Super stiff, heavy boots for technical stuff, lightweight boots and light trekking shoes do the trick for me at the moment. Even though I have to admit, the choice between he latter two still remains tricky :) As to the weakening of ankle muscles in shoes with ankle support: This is just common sense. If you constantly wear boots with ankle support, your ankle muscles will adapt. Thats another reason to wear light shoes too. Or even better: Do an occasional bare feet walk, this will improve many stabilisation muscles. 

While experience from winter hiking and climbing (its more high altitude trekking) Kilimanjaro will be of use in the approach and for having some idea of how you react to high altitude it is still not at all sufficient for climbing this peaks. According to internet sources there are glaciers, seracs, zones with rockfall and a steep of ~45deg. This is a serious mountaineering undertaking which apart from technic also requires experience to judge the dangers. Especially the glacier which is described as a labirynth of crevasses in combination with dangers from rockfall and seracs makes local knowledge of a guide very valuable. In short: Having no previous mountaineering experience it is essential to hire a guide for such a tour. Additionally you will profit a lot from his knowledge and will be able to enjoy the trip. If you insist on doing it unguided you first need to get the technical knowledge (look for courses by mountain/guide organisations) and apply it on easier tours to get experience. With that you will also get a feeling for how challenging such a trip is and whether you are able to master it. 

If it is load bearing, then hell no. This is a mess of cross- and ring-loading, which will break the biners. If it is just a material storage placement, then it is simply confusing. And of what I know about the Eiger, when you find a good placement, you will never ever only use it for hanging up your gear, always for protection. So all in all more information about the context would be needed to make a definitive answer, but I cannot imagine why this should be legit. Edit: Unfortunately the pictures in the link given in the question are probably not in chronological order, so there is no information extractable about when or where this photo was taken. 

This is also needed when having more than two people on a rope on a glacier. If you attach a climber in the middle of the rope, you should also add an "extension" when tying in, but that doesn't seem to be the application the OP has in mind. There are multiple options, I use the first: 

This is a webbing sling that is sewn together at regular distances. Usually about 2 bar tacks are used, so they are not very strong (about 3kn). Therefore they can break when loaded with e.g. a fall. This is not a problem as long as you clip into just one loop. Never clip in over two loops, then you will disconnect from the sling when the bar tacks in between fail. If correctly attached, the breaking of the bartackes can even reduce the impact absorbing energy. Fifi: 

This question is about the simple type of bow often (but not exclusively :) ) made by children that consists of a branch of wood with a cord tied to both its ends. Obviously such a branch should be straight and uniformly thick. Furthermore there is the question of how much force it can take. I experienced that wood from certain brushes/trees can take more force (at the same diameter) than others. Which trees/bushes make good bows, i.e. can take a lot of force? Please also give a reference in what region those types can be found. I am asking from a middle european standpoint, but answers for other regions are welcome as well. 

As noted in the last sentence of the question: Animated Knots is not (mainly?) addressing knots in the context of climbing/mountaineering. There is significant difference in types of knot used and purposes between different disciplines (as well as a lot of overlap of course). In this specific case two problems are listed: 

Canyoneering has one major danger that is not (normally) one in mountaineering: water. If you get stuck abseiling along/in a waterfall and end up hanging in the waterfall, you can drown. An "engaged" friction knot can be difficult to loosen, especially when in an averse environment like a waterfall. The only time I did canyoning an experienced party member went down first. After him everybody that finished abseiling down secured the one following him by holding the rope. In case the person abseiling lost control, you would pull on the rope thus stopping the descent. Apparently this technique is known as "fireman backup". 

No, if you use an adjustable daisy chain you do not need a fifi hook. Then it is as easy as attaching the extended chain to your placement and adjusting it to the desired length. As adjustable daysies are made from one tape, there is anyway no attachement point to place a fifi hook. One sidenote: Extending the chain with one hand after attaching it is borderline cumbersome to impossible, so if it has been made too short initially you are in a mess. The adjusting also only works if not twisted or otherwise messed up, so you need to be tidy. For those reasons quite some aid climbers do like to use regular daisy chains. 

The linked question on biology.SE actually is for many aspect already the answer, one just needs to convert the findings to the outdoors/hiking. I will first reiterate the most important anatomical points from the said question and then pull conclusions for outdoor use of red light. So if you don't care about the background and know what rods/cones are, just skip the next paragraph or if you want more, go read the linked question instead. The eye contains (primarily) two types of photoreceptor cells: Rods and cones. There are three types of cones sensitive to different wavelength areas, thus allow for color vision. They are active during good illumination (photopic vision). Rods are much more light sensitive but there is just one type, so distinction of color is not possible (scotopic vision). Rods are primarily sensitive in the blue-green light range. In intermediate lighting conditions both kinds of cells can be active (mesopic vision). The distribution of rods and the different cones in the eye is not at all uniform: Cones are concentrated in the center while rods are absent in the center and their maximal concentration is at a visual angle of approx 20deg. Additionally in the center there are no S-type cones (sensitive primarily in blue light) and more L-type (redish) than M-type cones (greenish). A great (while lengthy) source for information about the sensitive of the eye to light at different wavelengths is Color Vision by Bruce McEvoy. night vision Red light affects rods and thus night vision the least. It still does, so light intensity is key. What is more important is that the center of the eye is mostly sensitive to red light and has no rods at all. So it is impossible to read anything with blue light or in very dark conditions where only rods are active (well the second is anyway problematic for reading). Just try to read without moving along with your eyes. Using dim red light allows to use rod cells for peripheral low light vision and keeps them active (dim red light!), and at the same time you get much increased vision in the center. Thats why red is great for reading maps in the dark. color vision That one is quite obvious: If it is important to discriminate colors you need to use white light. hunting Red light is might be useful for stealth as many animals have more rods than cones compared to humans, and are thus perceive red light relatively less strongly compared to humans. This might give you an advantage. Visibility at distance When light travels through air it is scattered by a process that is dependent on the wavelength. Short wavelengths (i.e. blueish) are scattered much more than red (that is why the sky is blue and sunsets red). Thus red light is better visible at a distance. Uses are position lights, e.g. car rear lamps or the light on the back of the Petzl Nao+ headlamp. Also there seems to be a misconception about the brightness and cone characteristics of a light source: These are independent of the color. You could have a red light just as bright and focused as a white one. It is clear that a bright red light is not useful, as it would destroy night vision as well and reduce color perception, while I cannot think of an advantage. However having a more focused red light would actually be preferable to the wide cone usually used for head lamps. As described above, red light is most effective for the center of the eye, so only illuminating a spot in direction of view would be more effective.
