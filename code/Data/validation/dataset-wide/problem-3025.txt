It has taken so many years for humans to develop math and it is still going on and will keep going on. It may feel very easy now to use math in our daily lives but we have reached that stage of easiness over a very long period of time due to some very deep thoughts of many people over this long period of time. So to answer your question, you should interpret the easiness as a result of enormous amount of effort over a long period of time. This reminds me of a quote - "Standing on the shoulders of giants". 

I know there has always been some debate concerning whether or not a certain logical system (like classical logic) is the correct one, especially when it comes to propositional claims about the external world we inhabit. The Philpapers survey from 2009 shows a clear majority (51.6% classical : 33.1% other : 15.4% non-classical) in favor of classical logic (I'll assume the question refers to which logic they believe to be correct when it comes to reasoning, but there are really several different interpretations of that particular question, which may have influenced the results). I would also consider myself a proponent of classical logic as the correct logic when it comes to evaluating the world as it is (though not necessarily how it relates to reasoning, especially when it comes to the inconsistent beliefs many individuals hold). I would say that my philosophical worldview (there is a mind-independent external reality that operates on some deep, fundamental principles) heavily influences this, as I don't believe in any inherent fuzziness that might be amenable to a multi or many-valued logic, and I certainly don't believe in true contradictions (whatever the hell that would even mean). With that being said, what are the best avenues one could take if they wanted to show that classical logic (or another logic, as Alan Ross Anderson was a platonist with respect to relevant logic) was "better" than all the others when applied to uncovering the nature of reality? In addition, has any progress been made when it comes to the program of Universal Logic, which would uncover the foundations or similarities between every logical system conceivable? Any input on this is greatly appreciated. 

We can carry on this process until there is no further substitutions to make. Well, that condition won't ever come in this case as this is plain old infinite recursion due to self reference. If you can't reach a condition where no further substitutions can't be made you simply cannot reach a conclusion. In this particular case you cannot say S is true or false. Similarly if you email a person about some information and he never replied (in terms of whether he knows about it or not) for whatever reason, would you say that the person knows the information or he doesn't. 

Firstly, as Gugg correctly points out, there exist other converved quantities. Hence, you can't say "energy is the quantity which is being preserved*, because then you have no way of distinguishing energy from, say, total mass, or total momentum. Secondly, it is a fairly non-trivial fact that there exist conserved quantities. To the best of my knowledge, physicists (and mathematicians) have done a fair amount of research into the question of existence of such quantities - see for instance Noether's Theorem. Hence, you can't just "characterise the meaning and the substance of energy" by the conservation law, until you have established that there is a conserved quantity out there to be characterised - and to do that, you have to identify the quantity in any case. 

Yes, it is possible and reason for it depends on the temporal nature of existence and "why". To empirically find that something exist would require a less temporal scale as compared to find why that something exist. The question of why can go on way too far in the past or way too far in the future. So basically you can find the existence in very small time scale whereas "why" would require much larger time scale to get answered. For example: You could come to know the existence of something on your table as soon as you look but to reason why it exist would require you to spend more time as compared to "just looking at it". For some moments you will know the existence of the object on the table without knowing why. 

From a purely theoretical perspective, mathematics is easily seen to be infinite, in the sense that it contains infinitely many theorems. Why? You can just produce a machine that spits out true mathematical statements without end. For example (if one is lazy): 1 = 1, 1+1 = 1+1, 1+1+1 = 1+1+1,... Of course, these are special cases of a general rule that x = x for any x, whatever this x is. But I don't think there is any mathematically definable line to divide such "trivial statements" from "true mathematical theorems". If you accept that integer arithmetic speaks of a universal object that just "is", then Godel's Incompleteness Theorem tell you (among other things) that to describe arithmetic you need infinitely many axioms. This is a rather strong statement, and it goes in the direction reverse to your hypothesis: mathematics is very infinite. It isn't just that there are infinitely many theorem, there are infinitely many basic rules that cannot be derived from the rules you start with. If you want to do mathematics in a purely formal manner (just transforming formulas, without reference to their meaning) then you can't even say what integer arithmetic is (in finite time). Of course, the above remarks are about the purely theoretical (meta)mathematics. If we think about mathematics as something that we do in our particular universe, and we accept that this universe is somehow finite in principle (or that our civilization has finite span, or that human being have a finite aptitude for mathematics, etc...), then mathematics is finite as well, as was pointed out in other answer. 

You may or you may not reach to the eventual point. We just don't know yet. We are severely limited in our abilities to figure this out. Science says if you observe something, try to find what caused it and what caused that cause and so on. If at the first cause itself you start to believe that there is no cause of it then you have basically blocked yourself at that point for further exploration and experimentation. Look at the history and you will find people whole believed that they know the "starting point" (i.e some form of the word God) were the one who were against the scientific approach. Science never says that there is or there is no "eventual starting point". It only says "We don't know, so lets just keep exploring, keep theorizing and keep proving" 

It would seem that figuring out a solution to the paradox of analysis would be of prime importance to philosophers, especially considering the fact that conceptual analysis seems central to philosophical practice. The wiki page, however, seems to list under proposed resolutions simply biting the bullet and claiming analysis gives us no new knowledge (which seems slightly crazy, as writing bachelor = bachelor seems to give you something epistemically different from bachelor = unmarried man), or going the Quine route and rejecting conceptual analysis outright (which most philosophers don't seem to accept judging by a survey of the field). I'm almost positive the wiki page neglects to mention other possibilities when it comes to resolving the paradox, and I'm hoping the good people here can point me in the right direction. 

Check out Appeal to emotion. This seems to best describe the conversation, where the use of word friendship is to focus on emotion than facts. 

When something (in this case maths) becomes part of our daily lives in terms of how easy it is to use in our day to day lives and how "obvious" it seems, along with the fact that we are able to describe many phenomena around us using maths (Example: physics), we tend to start believing that "whatever" created this world must be based on the same math that we are used to. IMHO this is just a cognitive bias of humans. The universe is not based on math, instead we developed a tool/language called math which fits our cognitive abilities and its limitations and allow us to understand and explore the world around us. 

I have always assumed, perhaps naively, that the basic goal of ethics is to provide judgements of possible outcomes of one's actions, and thus also advice on the way one should act. I just realised that others view this matter quite differently, and I wanted to clarify this somewhat. Let me elaborate on how I understand ethics. Consider a person just about to make a decision. The decision leads to some possible outcomes, and suppose for the purpose of simplicity that the outcomes are known and well understood. The possible outcomes are evaluated using ethics; some will be considered better, some worse, and ideally it will be possible to compare each pair. Then, the "right" or "moral" thing for the person in question to do is to to choose the highest-ranked of the possible outcomes, and act accordingly. Note that by "outcome" I mean everything that happens after the decision is made, including all the costs and side effects. For example, ethics could tell me that killing innocent people is wrong; then common sense would tell me that if I have my finger on a trigger of a loaded gun pointed at a person then my pressing the trigger would result in killing that person; therefore I should not press the trigger in this situation, all other things being equal. But if that person happened to be just about to kill two other people, then ethics would (arguably) also tell me that one dead person is not as bad as two dead people, and if experience told me that the only way to save the two is to kill that one person, then I would conclude that I should, after all, pull the trigger. Call this "outcome oriented ethics". However, it I realised that some others seem to view ethics more as a set of "rules", "rights", and so on. Thus, I might have a rule saying "I shouldn't kill", which would require me not to kill another person. As the example above suggest, this rule should probably be extended with "... except to save a life" or something of this kind. Call this "means oriented" ethics. I suppose that if each rule produced by "means oriented" ethics was given a disclaimer "... unless it serves greater good to do otherwise", then it would reduce to "outcome oriented" ethics. I have considered "outcome oriented ethics" as the natural way to go about ethics for most of my life, so I am confused. Is ethics as understood in (modern) philosophy "outcome oriented" or "means oriented" (or both, or neither)? Given that ethics is apparently quite a big chunk of philosophy, the answer is not very likely to be a simple "yes/no", so perhaps a more reasonable question is: How does "my" conception of ethics relate to what ethics actually is? Let me end with a disclaimer: I am definitely not a philosopher, my interest in matters related to philosophy arises mostly from simple human curiousity. 

I wouldn't call infinite recursion an error, it is more about practical purpose and infinite recursion is of no practical use to us mortals as we cannot use it to reach any conclusion. But in terms of computation an infinite recursion/loop is a bug :) 

A lot of people in science talks about science as a discipline to find the fundamental laws or rules of the nature. They consider these laws to be the underlying mechanism that is making the nature as it is. Usually they will use mathematics equations to describe these so called fundamental laws. Now if you say that a particular mathematical equation describe the trajectory of a ball and this law is the underlying mechanism then who in the nature is actually computing the equation? Is it the ball, the particles, the earth, the air? Well the answer is nobody and that's what makes the whole argument of "underlying laws" or "how nature works" wrong. I guess the proper way to address all the scientific knowledge (or any knowledge for that matter) about nature would be that it is about coming up with "generalized representations" of the observations i.e it just "describe" the observations and it doesn't mean to find how nature actually works.
