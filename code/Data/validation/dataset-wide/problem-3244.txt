So it was the first time both capitals and minuscules were used in a standard way (instead of ocassionally as with previous minuscule scripts). I don't think it would be possible to pinpoint exactly which was the first text ever to use them together, though. 

One example that comes to my mind is the War of the Triple Alliance, perhaps more commonly known as the Paraguayan War, which was won by the said Triple Alliance (Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay). EDIT – But to be honest, I don't actually know nor could I find out whether it was called like that while it was being fought; it's pretty probable that it was called either "Paraguayan War" by the Allies and "War against the Triple Alliance" by the Paraguayans at the time. 

From what I gathered, without knowing which book it was you were reading, both towns appear to have been two mining centers, established by the mining company El Boleo, and they must have just taken their names from existing landmarks (mountains or streams – there's a Purgatorio stream near Santa Rosalía, in the center of that mining area). In any case, looks like it was nothing strange for the Spaniards to name places like that, for, from what I have seen, there's at least one Purgatorio stream in Sonora, another one in Jalisco and, much farther away, one in Colombia. The Purgatoire river, being in Colorado, it's my guess that it was so named by the Spaniards and got its name anglicised (Protestants don't believe in Purgatory and it would be odd for them to name anything after it). Providence, Rhode Island, was named, as also was every Spanish town of that name, after the Divine Providence by its founders, deeply religious people, so in that case it was just coincidence. 

Land surveying and the Orion constellation After answering some of your questions, here's a point for further answers: How did the ancient Egyptians measure their land and use the whole Nile Delta to depict the Orion constellation onto it? We are talking about a distance of 8 kilometers (Pyramid of Djedefre to Gizeh) or 4 kilometers (two unfinished pyramids at Zawiyet el-Aryan to Gizeh) All pyramids are tied together. The three main pyramids are standing for the Orion belt. And two of the four outer stars exists as smaller (not so famous) pyramids. Only 2 stars are not represented. But they found plans for one more pyramid which should be build at the right position. 

Field tests have shown that this method could be used to measure a distance of 45 meter up to a centimeter. Longer distances like our 230 meter do not go, because then the human eye sees too little detail. So far we have three discoveries of such wood triangles, approximately from the grave of Sennedjem at Deir el-Medineh. 4. Aligning the three main pyramids Unfortunately, the linked source does not go into detail on how the ancient Egyptians did it. But as shown in the picture, all three pyramids are aligned at their square diagonal. 

5. Orientation to the north The pyramids are nearly aligned to true north (deviation is only 2.46°). A small but precisely worked pyramidion (made from wood or stone) is placed as close as possible to a north-south position on the flattened ground where the pyramid will be built. Then two lines are drawn, taking the edges of the small pyramidion and lengthening them on the side which lies in the shadow. During a day a surveyor notes down, where exactly the tip of the pyramid shadow cuts through those two lines. The pyramidion is precisely aligned north to south, when both lines are cut at the same distance to the corner of the pyramidion. To achieve this, the pyramidion is moved slightly over a period of days, until both segments are exactly the same length. 

Actions speak louder than words, they say. In the years following Jesus' death, the persecution against Christians came primarily from the Jews as chronicled in the book of Acts (4:3-22, 5:17-42, 6:8-8:1, 8:3, 9:2, 9:23-24, 20:19, 23:12-14, 12:1-5, 13:44-51, 14:5-6, 14:19-20, 16:16-24, 17:1-15, 18:12-17, 19:23-41, 19:27-28:30). The interesting thing about this time period (from AD33 to AD60-ish) is there is no record of claims against the existence of Jesus. There are numerous arguments against claims made by Gnostic cults (1 John, 1 Peter, and others) and one possible argument made in defense of the resurrection (1 Cor 15:12-19). However, nowhere in the New Testament is the existence of Jesus defended. By AD64, only 30-ish years after the crucifixion of Jesus, Nero began wide-spread persecution of Christians. During this time, countless hirtory books and ancient documents record Christians being imprisoned, tortured, and killed for their faith and their refusal to declare the emperor as god (and any other charges that could be trumped up against them such as setting Rome on fire). If, as some scholars believe, John wrote Revelation during the time of Domitian it could be a chronicling of the persecution of Christians by Rome. Polycarp, Irenaeus and other early Second Century church fathers also document the persecution during those times. My point about the period of Roman persecution is this: There are not records of attempts to prove the Christians wrong. Rather than just killing them and thereby solidifying their faith, how much easier would it have been to issue proclamations that Jesus did not rise from the dead, or that He was living in Gaul with his prostitute wife, or that He never existed? This persecution began a whole generation after the death of Jesus and establishment of the church. Even a campaign of disinformation would have made sense. But even during this time that the eradication of Christianity became a priority of State we have no indicators that denials of any of the claims made by Christians concerning Jesus were false. To me, this silence on the part of Rome and, before that, the Jewish authorities, is strong evidence. 

The site www.cheops-pyramide.ch is about how Egyptians were able to achieve an incredible precision when measuring with simple techniques. I'm going to summarize it. 1. Right angles in the corner The base of the Cheops pyramid forms a perfect square - the deviation from the 90° angle is a maximum of one minute, which is very precise when you consider the Cheops pyramid's side length of 440 Egyptian Cubit or 230.33 meter. By stretching a cord between two pegs stuck in the ground, a long straight line was marked out. Then to each peg an equal length of string was tied, more than half as long as the line drawn. By keeping the strings stretched tight and moving the ends around, the Egyptians could draw parts of two perfect circles. These arcs cross each other at two points. By drawing a straight line between these two points the original line is bisected at a right angle and the line is cut into two equal parts. 

The second method is more astonishing. Although ancient Egyptians did not know the theory behind the Pythagorean Theorem (a² + b² = c²), they did use it unknowingly. They used a so-called primitive Pythagorean triple 3-4-5 (3² + 4² = 5²). Take a long rope, divide it with knots into 12 parts from the exact same length. When you now lay out your rope as a triangle and use 3 parts, 4 parts and 5 parts as side lengths, you get a perfect right angle between your 3 parts and 4 parts side 

6. Using a rope roll to transport pyramid stones to the top There is some historical evidence that ancient Egyptians know a rope roll (that's not a pulley or pulley block). With the help of the rope roll it is possible to haul a 2.5 tons stone block including sledge up the 52° incline of the flank of the pyramid. This technique can be compared to slinging a rope attached to something heavy up over a branch of a tree and then pulling the heavy object up by grabbing the rope and walking a short distance away from the tree. If you walk down a steep incline you need even less force than on level ground. 

Child of God, you asked this same question on the Biblical Hermeneutics site just a few days ago. The evidence I gave there concerning what year was considered the beginning of Tiberius' reign is solid. For the sake of those not on that site, here is the evidence I offered: Augustus died in AD14. Thus Tiberius began his reign as sole Emperor. The 15th year, then, would have been sometime during the Gregorian calendar years of AD29-30. This is the time most historians ascribe to the beginning of Jesus' ministry. Luke took the historian mantle on when writing his gospel. I would suggest he was careful to count from AD 14 because that is when the reign of Tiberius began. Elsewise he might have said the reign of Tiberius and Augustus. The Roman Senate named Tiberius Emperor Sept 18, AD14. Before that did he serve a leadership role as Augustus' health was failing? Yes. But His reign did not officially begin until AD14. This is considered the agreed upon beginning of his reign for the last 2002.5 years. Luke would have had no reason to consider the "co-regency" as part of Tiberius' reign because no one else did either. The "15th year" is counted from AD14. Augustus died August 19, AD14 In Annals, Book 1, Tacitus reports that, after the death of Augustus, a Roman centurion attempts to report to Tiberius (7) who replies "I have not yet been given command [of the Roman army]." In Book 1.10, Tacitus writes that Augustus had not chosen and seeming did not want Tiberius to be his successor. If Augustus didn't consider them to be ruling together, I don't know why anyone else would. Book 1.12 shows that they are trying to name Tiberius as Caesar but he only wants to have partial power. In 13, we read that Senator Haterius says "How long, Cæsar, will you suffer the State to be without a head?" Even though they saw Tiberius as the presumptive Caesar, he was not officially so. The Roman senate recognized Sept 18, AD14 as the beginning of Tiberius' reign. Not Augustus nor the senate nor even Tiberius himself considered Tiberius to ever be co-regent. Sept 18, AD14 is the correct date from which to measure the 15 years mentioned in Luke 3:1
