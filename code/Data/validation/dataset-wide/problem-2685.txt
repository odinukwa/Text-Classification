This is of course a rather vast topic with innumerable references, but in a nutshell the mainstream answer seems to be: the world is observer independent but there should be someone to assert this. The details are numerous and tedious. Philosophers have distinguished the cases of many, few, one and zero observers. Also they know that what is true up to the limit is not necessarily true at the limit; so, one can disagree with transposing from the common sense to the singular case and beyond. There are more caveats in passing from 'one' to 'any', with 'possible observers' somehow lurking in the background. Solipsism is not a position that can be refuted and lawyers used to say 'unus testis nullus testis' (one witness is not a witness). Anyway an assertion such as 'the world is observer independent' needs someone to make it, a way to check its content and to decide if this is indeed the case. Ancient Greeks refer to practice of speaking your mind as parrhesia: that is to say frankly and sincerely what you believe the case is. Most people would probably say the world is observer independent. In a larger society with conflicting interests 'truth' became not what you believe to be true but what is provable. This is the positivist turn which governs much of today's philosophy. 'Provable' is taken to mean - by logical argument or by evidence. Skipping the analysis of observer(s), world, existence etc, the last word seems to be that there is not conclusive proof that the world is observer independent. 

You have to be a bit careful in philosophy when tossing around the word necessary. Philosophers, like kleptomaniacs, take things literally. :) However, in context, "That which is necessary is legal", or Quod est necessarium est licitum is actually a tenet of what's called the necessity defense that is recognized as common law and is in most states' statutory law. And what it means is: 

Sneaky, factually stated, circular reasoning - completely inaccurate. Fallacies in philosophy are wolves in sheep's clothing. If we're too liberal with the term's usage we run the risk of conversationally pedantic. Hope this helps. Happy hunting. 

Or, using the example of self-defense, "that which is necessary, is legal/moral" could be restated as: 

Just because something is false doesn't mean it's a "fallacy" - at least in a philosophical context. That word is reserved in philosophy, generally speaking, to mean logic that by virtue of it's deceptiveness is tragically bad. In this case - the "Stupid Assumption" - I would say this could possibly be a fallacy called "begging the question," which essentially means: 

Well. We don't. We never know that. And we can't ever know that. But, does that matter? The question becomes whether that's a function of our language, understanding of the world around us, or something completely different. Russell provides a number of avenues to this end that sort of bridge the gap between math, language, knowledge, etc. And, he writes well. David Lewis is sort of a hallmark (for me anyway) in these discussions. You could summarize "degrees of truth" through the notion of "possible worlds" in which a statement like "I believe the moon is made of green cheese" means that you're committing to the actual existence of moon made of green cheese, just in another time and space. Something like a "square'd circle," couldnt possibly exist. 

Real world situations usually display an amazing degree of complexity, unlike basic statements of arithmetic. Unfortunately, most attempts to extend Gödel's theorems outside of math end up mired in these types of problems. Because these theorems were developed particular to say something about number theory (more broadly, formal systems), it's often difficult for theorists to explain how ethics or other fields might constitute a formal system analogous to mathematics. Not saying it's impossible but it is unlikely that these kinds of theories work out, mainly because of how specific Gödel's work is to the philosophy of mathematics. 

which goes right up the logical/relational alley but doesn't hit the physicalist side as hard. He does ultimately link what he's saying back to panpsychism, amongst other things, but his approach seems a little less analytical than what you might be looking for. Would love to see if anyone here can dig up anything more current/directly related to the problem of mind-body physicalism and empiricism. 

As for your thought experiment, I don't find it particularly motivating. By asking me to "assume that math cannot be fully understood without external input", you're assuming the conclusion to your argument that mathematical knowledge is not necessarily a prior. Once you've sat down with a pencil and paper and actually proved the theorem yourself there's nothing else that can "deepen" your understanding: you already know it through and through. Maybe your understanding can be "broadened" by interpretation or visualization, but even then, these graphs are just visual representations of the logic contained in the math, not akin to how experiments relate to science. 

Something we all commonly encounter on the news without really considering it too often. An example - killing in self defense. In most examples of the necessity defense, an argument based on common good, or significant, unavoidable harm is given as the basis for necessity. So, your question essentially boils down to this (if I understand you correctly): Do any theories of morality have a similar clause: At times, doing the most moral thing requires acting immorally? The answer is, yes, though there might be some wiggle room in terms of what's defined as moral, immoral or amoral on a case-by-case basis. The necessity defense would fall under the umbrella of utilitarianism in terms of ethical theory. An oversimplification of utilitarianism might be stated as: 

Stanford Reference Or, simply by saying "This company is stupid" you are actually just stating the thing that you are trying to prove. It's circular reasoning. The other propositions stated (such as "they blocked my TV show") don't lead to a conclusion of "this company is stupid" - that has to be assumed for the conversation to even make sense. People are casually, conversationally, question-beggers all the time and it's not normally a problem. They're either not saying what they actually mean (I hate this company for preventing me from watching what i want) or the remaining logic is assumed / implied / obvious. So, that's why I include the caveat of tragically bad in the context of philosophy. There's enough implied in the comment for you to assume it's someone's opinion. It's under circumstances where things are stated as facts that it becomes truly messy and where I feel like the term "fallacy" is appropriate. An example:
