One can have quantitative predictions only if a hypothesis is well formulated within a background theory, which de facto will make of the hypothesis some sort of "mechanism". Also note that track records is not the only thing that matters in establishing a hypothesis, there is also: compatibility with other accepted theories, with common knowledge and auxilliary assumptions, with methodological principles, simplicity of the hypothesis, etc. For these reasons, an hypothetical causal relation between two types of phenomena will generally rely on (or take the form of) a hypothetical mechanism, framed in a background theory, which explains and predicts the observed correlation. As noted in an other answer, different hypotheses (one in which you have a spurious correlation between two effects of a common cause, another with a direct causal relation) can make the same predictions. Track records won't be sufficient in this case. One way to distinguish causation and spurious correlations is through interventions. If changing a factor produces an observational change then you have a causal relation. One can also vary the experimental setup to force two hypothesis to make different predictions in certain circumstances, which is also a form of intervention.

My car is not both red and fast. Either my car is not red, or it is not fast (or neither). Double negation 

I think this is intended as a rejection of metaphysics. Now the argument surmounts itself and the world so described in that the tractatus is, arguably, a piece of metaphysics. 

In a formal context, the rationale for this is that explicit definition of a term must use more basic terms--but how shall we define the most basic terms? Implicit definitions make it possible. This is why we are "allowed to do so": because there's no other option! This is clear in the case of numbers. The same reasoning can probably be extended to scientific contexts, where we need "fundamental properties" to start with. In natural languages, one rationale for this is that dictionary definitions are always a posteriori: they attempt to make explicit how words are used, but usage comes first. Quine observed this, and claimed that explicit definitions can only be given in very particular cases (when a new technical term is introduced explicitly), but that most dictionary definitions are more like attempts to capture usage. Another possible rationale could refer to all arguments in favour of direct reference, such as the fact that all we think we know about a term (that gold is yellow...) is in principle revisable by experience. Those arguments were put forth by Kripke. Arguably, if they are valid, then no explicit definition can be given to a term, or at least, not a priori. 

For a rather technical book in philosophy of quantum mechanics and QFT you can read Laura Ruetsche "interpreting quantum theories". You will also find numerous articles there (I link to subject pages, but you can browse the whole site): $URL$ $URL$ As you seem interested in the question of scientific realism, you can also read on this general issue (for theories in general, not QFT in particular), and the related issues, such as underdetermination (the problem of having two empirically indistinguishable theories) or constructive empiricism (the most influencial contemporary anti-realism). You can check all these subjects, including QFT, by doing a search on the stanford encyclopaedia. That's a good starting point to find references on a subject. $URL$ 

I think this claim is false: the line is important since it is a problem that interests many philosophers. Perhaps the author means that when doing philosophy on a specific subject (here biology) we can ignore this problem. Even then I don't agree. For example one could think philosophers should refrain from making scientific speculations because it's not their role, and the premises of an argument being a scientific result or a philosophical hypotheses certainly matters, so one should know where the line is. The argument provided is a non-sequitur: the fact that a scientific theory such as evolution has huge philosophical consequences does not imply at all that the line is unimportant. To the contrary I would say: if it were a mere metaphysical position rather than a scientific theory, the theory of evolution wouldn't have the same impact. 

When you say that answering a question involves giving an objective explanation of the current state of affairs in terms of causes and effects, you are implying that questions that do not concern objective states of affair or facts are meaningless. This begs the question against non-scientific Q/A. Questions that science could not answer could be precisely those that do not fall under this scope, for example ethical or metaphysical questions. Your examples of a succesful mystic theory/political ideology assumes that ethical and metaphysical questions could be amenable to factual questions but again this is question begging. How would you evaluate happiness objectively, without presupposing a definition of happiness in factual terms? And how would you know that your definition is the right one? Relying on the success of your happiness evaluation would be circular. All you can know is that your framework is succesful by its own standards but the viability of these standards (that happiness thus defined is really what we should aim at) would remain disputable. You'd have a sub-field of science indeed, but the foundations of the field (including the route from facts to values) would remain open to criticism. This is actually a problem for science as a whole. When a conceptual framework happens to answer questions in a systematic, objective and empirically accurate way, then indeed you can call it science. However there always remains questions regarding the foundations of this conceptual framework (what is a cause? An explanation? A fact? Can we distinguish facts from theoretical assumptions? Theoretical/methodological principles from metaphysical assumptions? From values/aims/intentions? What is truth? Etc.). These are not scientific questions, but the philosophy of science has shown that there is no straightforward answers and that facts, theories, metaphysical assumptions and values are much more interwined than one could naively think. There is always room for questioning the foundations of any scientific field, and these are the questions that science cannot answer. Your question seems to concern the use of such arguments to promote religious or magical thinking. Indeed religion often attempts to answer metaphysical and ethical questions, and this is the kind of questions science doesn't directly answer (for the reasons mentioned above: they are implied in the very foundations of science). However the fact that science doesn't answer everything certainly doesn't imply that religion or mystical intuition does, and arguably, dogmatism is no more desirable in ethics and metaphysics than it is concerning factual judgments. 

All depends on what kind of impossibility you're referring to. If by miracle you mean something that contradicts physical laws, and if by physical laws you mean what is physically necessary, then by definition, miracles are physically impossible. However one could still maintain that miracles are metaphysically possible, because physical necessity is weaker than metaphysical necessity (physical laws could possibly be different from a metaphysical point of view). In any case, miracles are logically possible because physical laws do not follow from mere logic.
