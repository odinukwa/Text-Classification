No, there's no reboot required to change or remove a second IP. DNS won't 'update' automatically, though. It should eventually expire, but I'd recommend manually deleting the record. A reboot won't help with that, either. 

1) Local Admins - do this using a security group and Group Policy Preferences 2) Trusted Sites - group policy again 3) ActiveX Control - depends exactly what it is and how it installs. May be one for a script. Please don't cop out and bodge it, the first two are EXACTLY what Group Policy / Preferences were built for. You're using cutting edge server technology, so utilise it! There are loads of resources on the net to start off with. 

I use rsync v. 3.0.4 and when I need to move something I use it with the --remove-source-files. I prefer rsync than mv. Unfortunately, when I use --remove-source-files, the directories are left on the source side (as said in the man). Is there a way to remove directories too once moved all the files? 

Is there anyone aware of someone seriously working on thunderdbird to get write support on ldap shared addressbook? 

I think the answer you're looking for is "No". There are ways to redirect ports and so on, but ultimately, your client software has to make a request on a port, whether that be entered by the user or written into code or whatever. Either way, it's a client-side issue and you can't solve it server side. They aren't able to just make a request to an IP address in general. As an example, when you type serverfault.com to in your address bar, Internet Explorer is really going to serverfault.com:80 There's no magic here, it just makes the assumption that a website is going to be on port 80 as that's the official port. The developers could just have easily forced us to choose each time, but they opted to be nice. If the website was on port 81 for some reason the request would simply fail and you'd have to manually type serverfault.com:81 

I can't answer to your question but I want to point on you on a detail that might be interesting: several sata hdd have a jumper to set them sleeping by default (the controller has to send a sata command to wake up the disk. [not all controllers can do that]). Is the jumper already set? Dam 

The title should be self explanatory but more in detail I'm looking for a way to protect the ldap from LAN brute force attacks. It would be fine to prevent password guessing by locking a password for a specified period of time after repeated authentication failures. It doesn't matter if this can be turned into a DOS. Unfortunately I can't find a way to do this and the documents I've found are really confused. 

You have three key misunderstandings here: 1) A GPO, by default, will only apply to objects which are in the OU 2) Computers will only ever process the "Computer" side of the policy 3) Users will only ever apply the "User" side of the policy It's generally considered best practice to separate GPO's for User and Computer policies to help avoid confusion and make it clearer what's applying where. In your case, you either need to create a separate policy for the Users and apply it to your SBSUsers OU, or use LoopBack policy to avoid the limitation listed in (1) 

I just purchased a license of safelyremove. It works with sata controllers too not only with usb. It's very nice. There is a full trial on the website $URL$ 

Unfortunately this is shown inside the terminal and I couldn't find any way to hit "ok" and then, of course, I get this message. 

I have a X3400 with 8 x (43w7598 250GB SATA 3GB/S HDD) set in the frontal bay and connected to ServeRaid 8K controller. The raid array works well but, even if I set the controller PHY to 3.0 (rather then Auto or 1.5), all the disks negotiate 1.5Gb/s with the controller. This sounds really weird to me because the disk are WD Caviar Black Sata2 disks (bought from IBM). The firmware is the latest available from IBM (accordingly to the IBM ServeRaid matrix). Any tip? 

You're not trying to do anything too special, and it's definitely possible. The way in which this is generally achieved is as follows: You configure a subdomain which is designed for receiving visitors redirected from an external domain. For example, . The page on the end of this will look at the headers and query the database to decide where to redirect to. If a user attempt to access directly, the page should return a 404, another error or redirect to your home page. The user configures their domain (or subdomain, whatever) with a new record of And finally, to prevent account hijacking, your service will normally generate some kind of verification code which the user adds as a record. This is exactly how Google do it for Google Apps. 

We are working on a project which involves different hardware all hosted in a single rack. The machines are mainly IBM servers: 2 x206 (scsi), 1 x226(scsi), 2 x3400(sata) and another assembled machine with sata controllers. We are using several raid controller. Some machines have only one Serveraid controller, others have one or more controllers not always Adaptec ones. All the firmwares and bios are updated. All the servers and connected devices are under ups. Over the last 4 months we experienced several strange behaviours in our hardware. Suddenly and randomly we loose 2 or 3 drives and the raid volumes stop to work. It can happen once a week but never at the same time of the day or week. Most of the times a rebuild process fixes the problem, sometimes we loose the data. Very often we just need to unplug the raid controllers, restart the server and the problem is fixed. At the beginning we thought it was due to firmware bugs but we performed an accurate update for every machine and raid controller and there is nothing else we can do on the hardware. We have really no hint on what's causing all these troubles. We are starting to think that it's an environmental problem but we don't know if there could be something interfering with our hardware. Have you ever heard of something like that? Do you have any idea on how to investigate the problem? 

DHCP works using broadcasts which will travel between collision domains (Layer 2, switches) but not broadcast domains (Subnets, routers). You can, however configure ip forwarders / ip helpers on the routers to do this. Even better, the DHCP sever will know which subnet the request originated from, meaning a single server can server for multiple subnets. 

Start again and RAID1 your 3TB disks. Performance will suffer in that you can't split between spindles, but you really do not want your VMDK's on non-RAID disks. If you do as you suggest, then your 2x 400GB disks will be fault tolerant, but the system that serves that data will not be. So you're not going to prevent any downtime - and as we all know, RAID isn't there as a substitute to backing up... 

I'm looking for a 4 ports pci or pci-express (not pci-x) sata controller with these features: - real hot swap support - no RAID support, or with RAID support that can be disabled through the controller bios interface or reflashing the bios My need is to hot plug/unplug one or more different sata1 and/or sata2 disks from different brands size and speed (even at the same time), coming from my customers computers to perform lab activities on them, like backup. I tried several Silicon Image controllers (3112,3114,3124) and Promise TX4. Everyone has issues: some disks are not seen or are dropped during the backup process while the Promise even hangs the host pc with some hard-drives. Adaptec raid (Serveraid 8s) controllers aren't transparent to the operating system and it seems there is noway to disable the raid. What would you suggest? Thank you!
