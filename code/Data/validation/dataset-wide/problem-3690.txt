For a half marathon I spent the week before carb loading and hydrating. I'm running a 6 mile soon and would like some 5Km races too. How should I change my diet for different length races? Should terrain affect my diet? Roar running requires less raw power then undulating gress and mud. Thanks Dave 

I have a mild case of Posterior Tibial Tendonitis, the physio has applied some Kinesio tape for support whilst it heals up. My understanding of tendons and muscles was that there wasn't much friction between them, if there were, moving would be a very painful experience. So, given that the tendons are lubricated via the inter-muscle membranes, how can applying tape to the skin provide any support at all to the tendons? Thanks Dave NB: I'm not asking for medical advise, I trust my physio. I'm just curious. 

It is true, so find a friend to help. Not someone to drive you around but someone to be in it with you. Someone to share your goals and your failures mutually, which means someone to train with you. Getting fit and\or loosing weight are as much a psychological battle as a physical one and having a partner so you can kick each other when you need kicking and celebrate with each other when you need to celebrate, can (and will and has) been the difference between success and failure. Lastly, and I might be assuming here, I know overweight peeps who won't train because they feel embarrassed around all the meat heads. They say things akin to "I just want to get a little thinner before going to the gym\going for a walk\going for a run". Get rid of that feeling immediately. 

How do I usefully interpret running metrics? I haven't been running for long. I've got a heart monitor and a GPS watch (all the gear and no idea), but I get a buzz from seeing the metrics anyway. I'd like to know how to interpret the metrics I collect though. What is the key elements to look for in these metrics? 

You have as much right to be there doing what you are doing as anyone else. Anyone who says differently can bugger off. You are doing something to better yourself, which instantly puts you ahead of most people. Very few people look sexy while working out, most of us just look sweaty, smelly, and uncomfortable. 

Naps help the learning process, the brain sorts out the stuff you've learned. Napping and studying go hand in hand. Likewise, rest after exercise helps the learning process too. All in all, nap if you feel you want to, it'll only have good affects on both your fitness and your studies. 

I've been climbing for a little while now, strength is improving thanks to gym sessions to top up climbing sessions but the campus board seems to be to beginner climbers like the sun to Icarus. It's safe to look from afar, but don't get too close! So, what do I need to be able to do before I can safely start to work on a campus board? I'm assuming a good, safe progression would be hanging, then statically walking up one and down one, increasing that number before looking at the dynamic\plyometric training I see the grown-ups doing. 

The advice I was given by a professional physiotherapist was to concentrate on stride length, and landing on the back of the foot/heel (I pronate though, so this was probably foot shape specific). It may have been very generic advice and not something an Olympic champion would care about, but it helped my pace/lap time quite a lot. Squats and glute exercises are worth considering too, especially if you are increasing your mileage fairly quickly, both help if you suffer from shin-splints. 

The main problem with eating breakfast before a work out is you have to wait an hour or more for it to be digested. For jogging, a lot of people prefer to eat a carbohydrate rich meal before bed to avoid the wait in the morning. If you aren't doing anything intense, a low speed 30 minute jog for example, this probably isn't necessary. But for more intense work outs you will use your glycogen supplies quickly without carb-loading the night before. You'll then get tired and do less, and lose lean tissue. So the choice for running is a low intensity jog on a piece of fruit or drink, or mid-high intensity with a meal the night before. 

As you're not a professional athlete (I'm guessing), or even if you were, it's really whatever works best for your body based on the sport and the food which takes a few months of trial and error. 

The evidence for post-workout protein shakes increasing your performance for running isn't conclusive, so this is somewhat anecdotal advice. I've been running for about 4 years regularly and in the past 6 months tried protein shakes after the long and mid runs. I've increased my speed from 8.1mph to 9mph in that time, and up to 9.5-10mph for 5k runs. I've also lost weight in that period from the eating less via the protein shakes, A 500ml serving keeps you sated for an hour or so later until a main meal, and is about 120 calories. The protein powder I used is by Bio-synergy, which is whey powder (basically dried milk). The cheaper stuff you get at a discount seems to be missing not only taste, but some amino acids and bulked out with soya. The one chose is also targeted at lean muscle growth rather than body building/bulking up, which helps. It's an easy and fairly cheap experiment to try, just be sure to stick with a good brand that is carb free, and avoid the soya shakes. 

A good general rule is to eat the amount of calories you are burning on the run, 1.5 - 3 hours before hand, or atleast 2/3 of the calories. Once you get fitter and run faster you'll need to consume fewer calories as your metabolism becomes more efficient. Eating low Gi/GL food means you get slower energy release food, pasta is a fairly common one, pittas or oats + yoghurt are also good. You should also bear in mind how much sleep you've had the night before, and when you are doing the run. The best time of the day to exercise is around 4pm-5pm. 

You can't. Spot reduction of fat from any area of your body is not possible. You can, however, lose your overall body fat and that will surely slim down your thighs. 

You haven't mentioned how long have you been doing your endurance running, though. Weight loss is a long-term process. Depending on how extra body fat you have, it might take a long long time for you to reach your goal weight. Any sort of physical exercise is not necessary for the weight loss. Again, it's calorie in vs calorie out. However, if you lie in your bed or simply sit on a chair for the whole day, your BMR will be very low. You don't want that. This is because, with low BMR, your calorie needs per day will also be low. Eating less food will make keep you hungry for a longer time. 

That's pretty much the reason for the asymmetry in your body. In fact, most people have these kinds of issues when they train. Simply because our dominant hand tries to compensate for the weaker hand. You can fix this by balancing the amount of work according to how much the difference there is between your muscles. For e.g., in the bench press, use dumbbells instead of barbells and end your session with a few sets (1-2) with your weaker side. Repeat this until you feel symmetry in your body. 

Carbohydrates are the most common macronutrient that is present in our food. For the best case scenario, decrease it and not the fats and proteins. Again, how much fat, carbs or protein doesn't matter as long as you have a calorie deficit. If you wanna' lose weight and keep it off, the thing you need to keep in mind is moderation. No single food can be categorized as healthy or unhealthy. Just feed your body as you find convenient and comfortable. Eating 'healthy' 9 out of 10 times is enough for living a healthy lifestyle. 

It's not really necessary to do intermittent fasting to lose weight. If you are comfortable with it, it's fine. Just keep in mind that in the initial days, you'll feel hungry, a lot. Your body will adjust with time. 

This is because you are not eating in a sustained calorie deficit. It's the only thing you need to lose weight. Calorie in vs Calorie out. This means you can eat fried chicken at your local KFC every day and still lose weight. That is of course if you are in a calorie deficit. Of course, this is not a healthy approach to losing weight since you'll not fill the nutritional needs your body has in regards to the macro and micro-nutrients. 

The main factor for muscle hypertrophy is volume. It doesn't matter which order you use in your workouts while training as long as your muscles are getting sufficient stimulus for growth. As @mjb in comments as said, you there is no method which is 'better' here. I'd like to repeat the same thing. However, the option 2 is the better split for someone who wants to optimize their workout since it will allow the muscle to relax a bit before you pound it with another exercise after your first one. The issue, however with the option 2 is that you will not get a big pump, but as long as the volume remains the same, it won't matter.
