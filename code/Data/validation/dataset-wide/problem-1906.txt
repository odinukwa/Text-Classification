Provide Solutions What I mean by this is, attend the meetings, learn about the problems that your team are facing, think of solutions and share your ideas. If you can built a reputation as someone who is able to help find solutions then you will gain trust. Meet deadlines This one is more difficult as there are a lot of outside factors that affect this other than just yourself. Meet deadlines, getting a reputation as someone who is consistently delivering late is never good for your career. Talk to your team & Take an interest Sometimes just taking 5 minutes to talk with your team, get to know them better, meet up for lunch etc can help build external trust, those extra friendships help bridge the gap between co-worker and co-worker i would trust with an issue Take an interest in their problems, see if you can help. No one likes being stuck on an issue. However, remember boundaries. Don't consistently leave your desk, badger your team mates or appear to be avoiding work, this will build you the wrong kind of reputation. Work hard When you have your issues and your jobs, work hard and appear responsible. No body would want to give an important task to someone who appears lazy and reckless. I hope this helps you figure out a way to get more work through building trust in your team! 

I'm going to take a different approach to the other answers here and say No. Sure you have an offer from another company and you're planning on accepting it. But until you have that job signed off you are still not guaranteed that position. I'm going to focus on two potential things that could happen. 1. Something goes awry There is still no guarantee you have that job yet. You have an offer. Something can still prevent that from going through. Be it a sudden cut in budget that closes the position. A bad review or audit that closes the company. Bad sales causing that location to be shut down. Any number of things could stop that position from still being there. Perhaps the people who interviewed you reported back up to their superior who disagrees with their choice. Alternately you could go in ready to sign over and see / hear / learn something that turns you right away from wanting that job. I'm sure you would rather still have those other options if you go in to sign and learn that it wasn't all that it first appeared to be. 2. The others become better On the flip side of the above there is the possibility that those second interviews will allow you to learn more about those companies, perhaps benefits or perks or job / training opportunities that you didn't know about before. Something that will make you rethink your choice of company completely. Conclusion So in conclusion, i think that until you actually have a job, signed onto a contract and begin working then you are still on the market, and should still be wary of other opportunities. 

I would send them a polite letter (or e-mail) stating that you have accepted another job offer (don't go into more specifics than that) and appreciate their time and effort in trying procure a job for you. Let them know that it is just the best decision for you, your career, and family. Beyond that, there is no reason to do anything more or feel guilty. Job hunting is vicious and you should only be looking out for you and your family. They should understand and not have any hard feelings as offers can crop up out of nowhere. 

I mentioned these issues in a quick moment with one of my managers (my true manager is on vacation at the moment) and he said the company will reimburse my mileage or I can use one of the company's operation's department automobiles if I get approved by the insurance carrier and he said we will go over it tomorrow. I have 2 issues with this "solution": 

Remember, documenting a case (assuming the goal is to make a change of some sort) requires an extreme level of control and discipline. Knowing when to add emotionally charged responses and statements are critical to achieving this goal. On some level, you are manipulating your readers and any master manipulator will tell you, the cardinal rule is to keep your emotions in check so they can be properly utilized when needed. Depending on the level this gets too, the more factual you sound the better you look (both in person and on paper). Of course being robotic about a situation will be just as bad as being hysterical. Edit: As Joe S. stated, if this has been a reoccurring issue and you plan on taking legal action then you should indeed consult a lawyer on the specifics. There is a specific way to present harassment cases in court and knowing the approach a legal professional will take is the best (if you plan on going that far). 

You wait as long as you need to until you require their services. If a cleaner emailed you, you wouldn't get back to them until you needed them to clean something. You wouldn't call a plumber before you needed one. Therefore you don't need to reply to recruiters until you need them (or until you get very close to needing them, e.g you know you're quitting in a few weeks) At the end of the day, they don't mind waiting, as long as they get your services they will be fine with it. 

Emphasise your strengths As always with interviews you should be trying to present yourself in the best light possible. So when it comes to them asking about your 2 year gap don't just say 'Oh I was meeting personal goals' you want to show what you did and amaze them with the transferable skills you learnt. Transferable skills For example did you have to communicate a lot with other people? Has this improved your communication abilities? Are you more clear and concise now? Communication is a skill that is important in every workplace, you will rarely work alone and someone who is able to explain themselves concisely will be a fantastic advantage. Were you frequently presented with difficult tasks? Did you complete them on time to the best of your abilities? Showing that you can handle difficult tasks and still give it 100% of your effort shows that you aren't likely to just give up and stop trying if you are presented with difficult tasks whilst working for them. This is definitely a desired quality to have. Were you presented with conflicts, either in the workplace or with a customer? How did you handle it? Did it go well? Someone who can remain calm and professional whilst in a conflict of any kind will be a very good trait to have, if you have an example of doing this then definitely bring it to their attention. Someone who isn't going to snap at a client in high pressure situations will be a very valuable person to have. Conclusion All in all, as long as you can show what you learnt, and show how this has improved you then I can't see it being too much of an issue. However, on top of this you might want to make sure you have done some sort of training course or tests to bring yourself up to speed. Things change fast in the IT world and 2 years is actually a fairly long time to be out of it. Your biggest challenge probably won't be the 2 year gap, but will be the lack of current knowledge, so make sure you brush up on all of that too to make sure you aren't at a disadvantage! 

This way the time and companies are consolidated. You can also explain it at an interview if they ask (which they will most likely). Consolidating has 3 benefits over breaking it up: 

I can see your concern and confusion with this employer and this opportunity. Keeping in mind that if you are interested, then you should get clarity on points about the position such as a job description, salary, benefits, etc. Treat like any other job, find out as much as you can before committing to it. Analysis & Thoughts For starters you mention some preliminary facts that we should address: 

Currently, I work for a company that gave me a written letter of offer (a few months ago) that stated expressly: 

Acquire New Employment Sometimes, especially in business, it is better to just cut your losses and move on. This is the easiest and least painful solution to both you, your career, and your family/life. You are never obligated to stay with a company forever and deal with an extremely disruptive and toxic work environment and team. Rebuild The Team If something is not working, then fix it. You are going to play office politics now, but be warned this a dangerous game and it is wise to have a backup plan or job offer. Your main gripe seems to be with the Junior member being inexperienced and playing office politics with the Team Manager. I would suggest that you get rid of the Junior first as you are the senior level developer and team lead. Document your evidence of the issues and show how you and the team have counseled him and given him training and experience on the projects/language. Discuss it with HR in private and then discuss it with your team manager in private, and then bring both together and make the motion to dismiss the employee and hire another candidate. This will fix a large part of the issue. If the manager is not improving after a new candidate is found then you should strongly consider moving on, changing teams/departments, or raising complaints to your boss's boss or senior level management. Note to upper management the serious issues facing the team and company and suggest that the manager is causing the issues. Suggest that it might be better to move on from him or have another manager run the team (BE WARNED: This CAN cost you your job. Managers usually stick with managers.) 

This causes friction in the team and their productivity decreases as everyone is harboring personal grudges. Ok so having a meeting first thing in the morning poses problems. Specifically because sometimes there are things out of their control that cause them to be delayed. So first option is push the meeting back 10-20 minutes and keep the punishments, the second option is to keep the meeting where it is but remove the punishments. Keeping the Punishments, moving the meeting O.k so you have decided to move the meeting to allow for unforeseen incidents but you've decided to keep the punishments if people are late. But what about these scenarios? 

There are a few key points to effective communication. 1. Keep it simple Using simpler language allows for a wider range of people to understand the points you are making. This is especially important when talking to somebody from a different field of work than you as technical words or acronyms won't make any sense to them. 2. Keep it short Humans are remarkably impatient and minds tend to wander during lengthy monologues from one person. Just think back to that last presentation you had to sit through and i'm sure you will see my point. Therefore you should try to keep your sentences short and informative. See the three examples below: 

I would say it goes in skills and hobbies. Technical Skills is reserved for the things such as the languages you know / the frameworks you use. work experience tends to have to be experience gained in the corporate world, e.g 4 years with company X doing projects A, B and C. As working on open source is not corporate work for a specific company, nor is it a specific technology i would say that leaves hobbies and skills. As your hobby is contributing to open source projects. However if your contribution was done on work time, for a specific project i would say you could get away with listing it as work experience. It comes down to when you did it, on your time or on company time. 

Ambitious and fast moving asset; which could be mistaken for aggression/arrogance or that you are always bettering yourself no matter what. Fluff promotion; they know the title is a throwaway and realize you don't actually the skills gained with the position (ie employer using HR tricks or you reached the limit of competency in a company). Valued asset; which means that you did not ask/imply for the promotion and instead you were promoted because the company actually saw that you were a good fit for the position. Committed team player; meaning that despite any turmoil the team or company was going through, you stuck it out and took on challenges for the benefit of the company. 

Reply with smarta** replies to those questions. "Do you know how to stop the paper tray light from blinking?" "Yes, I do, but your di** is not a big enough size for the paper tray." - Might want to know how sarcasm is taken or if you value your time at the company/relationships. Just saying. Ask them to be quiet please or that you are focusing on something super important. If you are on the phone do the typical "shhhh, I am on the phone" gesture/mouthing. Get a white noise machine and keep it at your desk, eventually either you will tune them out or they will hate the obvious white noise and stop meeting there. If possible, perhaps a small fan or radio to play music (appropriate office type) at a low volume but enough to make a conversation difficult. 

From personal experience, I have seen many people break the employment history up for the various owners to make their resume/CV look larger. However, you can consolidate it while still gaining a similar effect and put something such as:
