For several beautiful and expert discussions of the contrasts and relations between classical and the evolving subject of abstract or modern algebraic geometry, I recommend the following ICM lectures: O.Zariski, 1950, vol.2, p.77ff; B.Segre, 1954, vol.3, p.497ff; J.P.Serre, 1954, vol.3, p.515ff; A.Weil, 1954, vol.3, p.550ff; A.Grothendieck, 1958, p.103. (This falls obviously under the heading "reading the masters".) Indeed the whole algebraic geometry session, 1954, vol.3, pp.445-560, has an incredible list of short talks, (Groebner, Hirzebruch, Kodaira, Neron, Rosenlicht, Van der Waerden,...). the link is: $URL$ My apologies for such a brief answer. The article by Zariski, THE FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS OF ABSTRACT ALGEBRAIC GEOMETRY, points out the advances in commutative algbra motivated by the need to substantiate results in geometry. “The past 25 years have witnessed a remarkable change in the field of algebraic geometry, a change due to the impact of the ideas and methods of modern algebra. What has happened is that this old and venerable sector of pure geometry underwent (and is still undergoing) a process of arithmetization. This new trend has caused consternation in some quarters. It was criticized either as a desertion of geometry or as a subordination of discovery to rigor. I submit that this criticism is unjustified and arises from some misunderstanding of the object of modern algebraic geometry. This object is not to banish geometry or geometric intuition, but to equip the geometer with the sharpest possible tools and effective controls.” That by Segre argues for the preservation of geometric intuition in algebraic geometry for just this reason, for motivating and suggesting new questions to investigate. It seems particularly articulate and impassioned as he is arguing for a tradition that seems threatened to be lost. GEOMETRY UPON AN ALGEBRAIC VARIETY BENIAMINO SEGRE I. Algebraic geometry — that is to say, the branch of geometry which deals with the properties of entities represented by algebraic equations — has in recent years developed in two distinct directions, which in a sense are opposed to one another. One of these directions is called abstract in as much as it is concerned with algebraic equations defined over commutative fields subject only to slight restrictions; here the means employed are purely algebraic, including in particular ideal theory and valuation theory. The other direction may properly be called geometrical) this usually deals with algebraic equations in the complex domain, and from time to time appeals to ideas and methods of analytic and projective geometry, topology, the theories of analytic functions and of differential forms. The dualism between these two disciplines has close relationship and affi- nity with that which, three centuries ago, arose between l'esprit géométrique of Descartes and l'esprit de finesse of Pascal, and which, in the past century, on the one hand divided the geometers into analysts of the school of Plücker and synthesists of the school of Steiner and, on the other, the algebraists into purists à la Dedekind and arithmetizers à la Kronecker. However, this dualism, instead of proving harmful to geometry, offers undoubted advantages when the two lines of development, with their respective merits and possibilities, are regarded not as contrasting but as complementary. We cannot fail to recognise in the abstract method and its technique a peculiar elegance, an impeccable logical coherence, and to appreciate the im- portance of the results so far obtained by it, particularly in the study of the foundations of geometry and the difficult questions concerning the singularities of algebraic varieties. But equally we cannot fail to recognise that the geometr- ical approach, with its greater concreteness, lends itself better to the formula- tion and initial study of new concepts and problems; and that it presents an incomparable wealth and colour of its own, due to the interweaving of many diverse strands, to the subtle and perspicuous play of geometrical intuition, and to the possibility of readily constructing examples and investigating special cases. We may also point out that, in the geometrical discipline, corresponding to a more definite notion of algebraic variety, there is a much wider range of subjects and a far greater number of orientations and contacts with other important branches of mathematics, which have found, and are finding, therein inspiration and extensions beyond the purely algebraic field. Weil’s article describes how arithmetic benefits as well from the algebraization of geometry. ABSTRACT VERSUS CLASSICAL ALGEBRAIC GEOMETRY ANDRé WEIL The word "classical", in mathematics as well as in music, literature or most other branches of human endeavor, may be taken in a chronological sense; it then means anything which antedates whatever one chooses to consider as "modern", and may be used to describe remote antiquity or the achievements of yesteryear, according to the mood and the age of the speaker. Sometimes, too, it is purely laudatory and is applied to any piece of work which is thought to be of permanent value. Here, however, while discussing algebraic geometry, I wish to use the words "classical" and "abstract" in a strictly technical sense which will be explained presently. Until not long ago algebraic geometers did their work exclusively with reference to the field of complex numbers; at the same time they worked on non-singular models, or at any rate their concern with multiple points was merely in order to try to push them out of the way by suitable birational trans- formations. Thus transcendental and topological tools of various kinds were available, and it was merely a matter of individual taste, personal inclination or expediency whether to use them or not on any given occasion. The most deci- sive progress ever made in the theory of algebraic curves was achieved by Riemann precisely by introducing such methods. Later authors took consider- able pains to obtain the same results by other means. In so doing, they were motivated, at least in part, by the fact that Riemann had given no justification for Dirichlet's principle and that it took many years to find one. Similarly, the use of topological methods by Poincaré and Picard, not to mention some more recent writers, has often been such as to justify doubts about the validity of their proofs, while conversely it has happened that theorems which had merely been made plausible by so-called geometrical reasoning were first put beyond doubt by the transcendental theory. Now we have progressed beyond that stage. Rigor has ceased to be thought of as a cumbersome style of formal dress that one has to wear on state occasions and discards with a sigh of relief as soon as one comes home. We do not ask any more whether a theorem has been rigorously proved but whether it has been proved. At the same time we have acquired the techniques whereby our prede- cessors' ideas and our own can be expanded into proofs as soon as they have reached the necessary degree of maturity; no matter whether such ideas are based on topology or analysis, on algebra or geometry, there is little excuse left for presenting them in incomplete or unfinished form. What, then, is the true scope of the various methods which we have learnt to handle in algebraic geometry? The answer is obvious enough. Let us call "classical" those methods which, by their very nature, depend upon the pro- perties of the real and of the complex number-fields; such methods may be derived from topology, calculus, convergent series, partial differential equations or analytic function-theory. As examples, one may quote the use of the differ- ential calculus in the proof of the Kronecker-Castelnuovo theorem, of theta- functions in the theory of elliptic curves and abelian varieties, of topology in the proof of the "principle of degeneracy". Let us call "abstract" those methods which, being basically algebraic, are essentially applicable to arbitrary ground- fields; this includes for instance the theory of differentials of the first, second and third kinds (but of course not that of their integrals) and the greater part of the "geometric" proofs of the Italian school. Thus it is plain that, in all cases where an abstract proof is available, it may be expected to yield more than any classical proof for the same result. No one could deny this unless he had made up his mind to ignore fields of non-zero characteristic and was prepared to maintain that a theorem in algebraic geometry which has been proved for the field of complex numbers can always be extended to any field of characteristic 0. There are indeed many cases where this is so; quite often, however, the exten- sion can only be made to algebraically closed fields. As to denying any existence to algebraic geometry of non-zero characteristic, not merely would this, in view of recent developments, amount to denying motion; it would also deprive algebraic geometry of a rich and promising field of possible applications to number-theory, where one cannot do without reduction modulo p. Serre and Grothendieck describe the contribution of cohomology. I cannot give a good account of this material in a few words, but I strongly advocate reading these articles which marked the introduction of abstract methods in algebraic geometry in its most fruitful period. 

to teach successfully, first you must decide what is your goal. this may be your innate mission, or your department's imposed outcome, or whatever. Possibilities are: my students will learn to think logically and to pose and solve reasonable problems; as many as possible of my students will choose to major in math, or to take more math courses from our department; my students will pass the departmental exam on calculus skills in as large numbers as possible. Need I go on? These different goals suggest rather different approaches to teaching. E.g. if you want large numbers of students to go on, your course must be easy and give good grades. If you want the good students to go on, those who have a chance at success, your course should be harder and give grades more accurately,..... So a teacher should have a goal. It should be a worthy goal, and it should be one he/she has some idea how to implement. But no matter what your philosophy, and no matter how long you have been teaching, you must prepare every night before class. And you must present examples, not just theorems. Come to think of it I have written an essay on this topic, "On teaching". Perhaps i will link to it or even post it here. $URL$ 

I heard that Bott's theorem on the periodicity of the stable homotopy of the unitary group was delayed for some time by an erroneous computation in dimension 10, possibly due to Pontryagin. 

One of my students created the following proof that the medians of a triangle are concurrent while waiting to talk to me in office hours. Choose any two medians. 1) the two medians do meet somewhere inside the triangle. 2) If we join the centers of the three sides, obtaining a "central triangle", then the two given medians are also medians of that central triangle, hence their meeting point is also inside that triangle. 3) We are done. I.e. iterating the procedure shows that any two medians meet at the unique point common to all central triangles. 

This is an interesting discussion to someone raised in the 60's. It illustrates how lack of motivation creeps into books unnoticed. Back when Hartshorne was being written everyone was steeped in the then standard derived functor formalism of Cartan Eilenberg and Grothendieck, axiomatizing constructions of cohomology via complexes. So the pattern of this formalism explained so nicely by Anton and Andrew above was taken for granted. As the subject evolved, it was understood that acyclic resolutions could replace the more categorically natural injective ones. This is the gist of Evan's answer. Perhaps also there is a tradition in mathematics books of giving definitions without historical background. I have always had difficulty with any unmotivated definitions, such as abstract "residues" and modern Riemann Roch theorems, so I keep stressing to my students the value of learning the original version of Riemann, even if their goal is to understand cohomological and arithmetic versions. Anyway, excellent question. 

If C is any non hyperelliptic curve, and J(C) its Jacobian, consider the difference map of CxC-->Pic^0(C) ≈ J(C). This map collapses the diagonal curve isomorphic to C in CxC to a point in J(C), and is otherwise an embedding. Hence this map is a resolution of the (projective) image surface with exceptional locus ≈ C. I presume it is minimal. 

My advice. Make a concerted effort to publicize the value of pure research, and also make a good faith effort to teach classes that are valued by the university and that generate revenue. I.e. try to spend some time producing money which they always value, and try also to educate them to the value of what you love to do that they do not value. I.e. the argument could be: if you cut us you will lose money as well as prestige. Moreover in future when times are better and you try to resurrect this active group, it will cost you even more if you let it die now. A few years back we hired some of our best people by convincing the administration that times of short funding are ideal for hiring people who are undervalued where they are. I.e. we argued that in hard times there are wonderful talents who have been unable to find appropriate jobs, and that if we step up and make offers to them we can get terrific bargains. These people appreciate this show of confidence in them and tend to stay. 

You might consult $URL$ Your own definition seems a little confusing. A conic bundle is a map whose fibers are conics. Of course conics are embedded objects so this requires some kind of definition of a conic structure on the fibers. Plane conics come in three versions, irreducible and smooth, two distinct lines, and a double line. Usually a conic bundle has only the first two types and the locus in the target over which fibers are two lines is called the discriminant. Thus for a conic bundle over a surface, the discriminant would be the curve in that surface over which the fibers are reducible, rather than irreducible. However if that curve is empty then both statements are true. Indeed in the cited reference, minimal [complex] conic bundles are said to be those with empty discriminant curve. That paper studies real conic bundles for which the term minimal is said to apply to those with imaginary discriminant curve. If instead of requiring an embedding inducing the structure of conic on the fibers, one makes a definition that the fibers are only abstractly isomorphic to conics (as in this reference), then i suppose you could blow up the source threefold along a curve meeting each fiber at most once, and change a curve of irreducible fibers into reducible ones. That would seem to be a "non minimal" object you would want to exclude? A general reference on [conic and] quadric bundles is Beauville's paper "Varietes de Prym et Jacobians intermediaire", in Ann. Sci. de l'Ecole Normale Sup., (4) 10 (1977), no.3, p.309 ff. The concept of relatively minimal variety cited elsewhere here, seems related to minimal model theory, and hence presumably to the sort of bad example I proposed. As to the definition of minimal in the paper first cited in this answer, it seems not to be a sort that can always be achieved by modifications. I.e. it seems the threefold could be minimal and yet the discriminant curve still has real points. I am far from expert on this. 

Euclid's elements. i find it much more useful than Klein's books, but that may mean i misunderstand the question. indeed after many years of perusing them, i find Klein's "from an advanced standpoint" books more of a polemic than a useful text. Euclid on the other hand introduces many of the main ideas of modern mathematics.
