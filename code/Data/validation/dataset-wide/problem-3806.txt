Your example is in the category of schemes, but you then ask about maps of topological spaces. Assuming you care about schemes, the condition is that the source is one dimensional and regular, and the target is proper. That you can extend in this case is essentially the valuative criterion of properness; that you can't extend in any other case is basically the valuative criterion of properness plus Scott's argument. If you care about topological spaces, I don't know that there is any good criterion. Having the source be a one dimensional manifold and the target compact is not enough: Consider the line segment $(0,1)$ mapping to a closed disc in $\mathbb{R}^2$ by $x \mapsto (x, \sin 1/x)$; you can't extend to $[0,1]$. (Take the closed disc is large enough to contain the image of the map.) 

G and M then give several examples to demonstrate that most diagram chasing arguments can be rewrittten using the $E$ construction. 

When I studied physics, we learned how to write down planar waves and spherical waves. But, when I turn on my flashlight, I see a cone of light. How can I see that there is a solution to the wave equation which describes a wave in a conical region, dropping off sharply outside that cone? And am I right that the wave equation cannot describe a cylindrical beam? 

"The number of Plucker relations" is a little ambiguous, but there is no sense in which it is $k(n-k)$. The number of Plucker coordinates is $\binom{n}{k}$, so the number of degree $2$ monomials in Plucker coordinates is $\tfrac{1}{2} \left( \binom{n}{k}^2 + \binom{n}{k} \right)$. The vector space they span inside the homogenous coordinate ring of the Grassmannian has dimension $$\frac{1}{k+1} \binom{n}{k} \binom{n+1}{k}.$$ (Derivation available on request.) So a minimal list of relations between them would be of size $\tfrac{1}{2} \left( \binom{n}{k}^2 + \binom{n}{k} \right) - \tfrac{1}{k+1} \binom{n}{k} \binom{n+1}{k}$. Note that, if we fix $k$ and let $n$ grow, then $\tfrac{1}{2} \left( \binom{n}{k}^2 + \binom{n}{k} \right) \approx \tfrac{n^{2k}}{2 (k!)^2}$ and $\tfrac{1}{k+1} \binom{n}{k} \binom{n+1}{k} \approx \tfrac{n^{2k}}{(k+1) (k!)^2}$. So the number of relations is growing like $\tfrac{k-1}{k+1} \tfrac{n^{2k}}{(k!)^2}$, not $kn$. Now, many people mean specific lists of relations when they say "the Plucker relations". They don't always agree on which relations they mean, and they don't always mean an irredundant list. But, adding redundant relations would just make the list longer. 

Two points: (1) There is a result which is very similar to this. Let $G$ be a graph. Let $A$ be the matrix whose rows and columns are indexed by the vertices of $G$, where $A_{ij}$ is negative the number of edges from $i$ to $j$, for $i \neq j$, and where $A_{ii} = \lambda_i + \deg_i(G)$. Then the coefficient of $\lambda_{i_1} \cdots \lambda_{i_k}$ in $\det A$ is the number of spanning forests of $G$ with $k$ components, such that $i_1$, $i_2$, ... and $i_k$ are in separate components. Notice that the case $k=1$ is the matrix tree theorem: The coefficient of $\lambda_{i_1}$ is clearly the determinant of the adjacency matrix of $G$, with the $i_1$-st rows and column deleted. Basically any proof of the matrix-tree theorem should prove this as well. If you set all the $\lambda_i$'s equal to each other, then the coefficient of $\lambda^k$ in $\det(A)$ will be the weighted number of $k$-spanning-forests, where the weight of a forest with components $T_1$, $T_2$, ..., $T_k$ is $\prod |T_i|$. (Because that is the number of ways to choose $k$ vertices, one in each component.) Perhaps this is good enough for your purposes. (2) It is highly unlikely that there is a reasonable formula which gives you an exact count. More precisely, counting spanning forests is a #P-complete problem. See On the Computational Complexity of the Jones and Tutte Polynomials and note that counting spanning forests is equivalent to evaluating Tutte at $(1,2)$. This means that, assuming $P \neq NP$, there is no polynomial algorithm to count spanning forests. Now, "reasonable formula" is not a precisely defined notion, but I suspect that anything you would consider reasonable would give a polynomial time algorithm. In particular, note that computing an $n \times n$ determinant, all of whose entries have at most $n$ digits, is polynomial time. 

Let me try to explain the CM connection, as I think it really is the most intuitive way to understand this. Fear not, this is not a one line answer! I'll be working with $\mathbb{C}$ throughout. Every elliptic curve over $\mathbb{C}$ is of the form $\mathbb{C}/\Lambda$, where $\Lambda$ is a discrete rank two sublattice of $\mathbb{C}$. This description is not unique: If $\alpha$ is any nonzero complex number, then $\mathbb{C}/\Lambda$ and $\mathbb{C}/\alpha \Lambda$ define the same elliptic curve. If we have a two elliptic curves, $\mathbb{C}/\Lambda_1$ and $\mathbb{C}/\Lambda_2$, and a map $\phi$ between them, then there is a unique complex number $\beta$ such that $\beta \Lambda_1 \subseteq \Lambda_2$ and $\phi$ arises as the map which takes the coset $z+\Lambda_1$ to the coset $\beta z + \Lambda_2$. 

There are other sums with no good summation: for example 1+1+1+... Any decent method of summation would yield S=1+S. 

I claim that, if $h_k > h_{k+1}$, then $h_j > h_{j+1}$ for all $j \geq k$. This includes both your assertions above. (Note that $h_0$ should be considered to be $1$.) More precisely, I will prove that, for any positive reals $x_j$, we have $$\frac{h_0}{h_1} \leq \frac{h_1}{h_2} \leq \frac{h_2}{h_3} \leq \cdots $$ So, if any term is greater than $1$, so all all the following terms. Proof: The inequality $h_{k-1}/h_k \leq h_k/h_{k+1}$ is equivalent to $\det \left( \begin{smallmatrix} h_{k} & h_{k-1} \\ h_{k+1} & h_k \end{smallmatrix} \right) \geq 0$. By the Jacobi-Trudi identity, this determinant is equal to the Schur function $s_{k,k}$. In particular, since all the monomials in $s_{k,k}$ have nonnegative coefficients, the determinant is nonnegative as desired. QED 

Unlike Pete Clark, I have not spent any real time working on this sort of problem, so you should take all of this with a heavy grain of salt. But I think this algorithm is quite reasonable as a way to rule out CM, although it would be diffciult to use it to prove CM exists. EDIT: As FC points out, this algorithm only finds the lattices of the form $\mathcal{O}_K$, not the lattices of the form $I$ where $I$ is an ideal in $\mathcal{O}_K$. The latter may not even have real $j$-invariant. I don't see a way to get around this. Here is how I would do it: Start with your $j$ invariant, $j_0$. If it is not real, the curve does not have CM . If $j_0$ is real, compute $\tau$ such that $j(\tau) = j_0$ and such that $\tau$ is in $$\{ i t: t \geq 1 \} \cup \{ z : |z|=1, \ 0 \leq \Re(z) \leq 1/2 \} \cup \{ 1/2 + i t: t \geq \sqrt{3}/2 \}.$$ I'll describe the case where $\tau$ is on the imaginary axis; the other cases are similar. Here is the point which no one has made yet: The pure imaginary $it$ generates an imaginary order if and only if $t^2$ is an integer. So we only need to perform the computation with enough precision to determine whether $t$ is an integer. Of course, a floating point computation can never be known to converge to an integer, but it will very soon either do so or clearly fail to do so. 

To see associativity, note that both $(X \otimes Y) \otimes Z$ and $X \otimes (Y \otimes Z)$ can be canonically bisected with plane trees whose non-leaves are labeled with $X \sqcup Y \sqcup Z$, subject to the analogous conditions. (The analogue of the boxed condition is that the children of $v$ do not come entirely from $X$, nor entirely from $Y$, nor entirely from $Z$.) I think the logarithm of the corresponding group law is $t - \sum_{i \geq 2} |B_i| t^i$. Since this method can only categorify group laws whose logarithm has integer coefficients, this clearly cannot include many of the most obvious examples. 

You can define the problem however you want in your classroom. If you think that three dimensional operations should be used, make a list of which three dimensional operations you think are allowed and work out which field extensions they will give rise to. If there are all quadratic, then the result is still true. The one time I taught this, I decided modern students had no reason to care about straight edge and compass, and just talked about a pocket calculator with $+$, $-$, $\times$, $\div$ and $\sqrt{\ }$ keys. (Of course, soon, no one will care about this either.) 

I'd look into numerical homotopy software, such as Bertini or PHCPack. Numerical homotopy software attempts to solve problems of the following sort: Suppose we have a family of polynomial equations $f_1(t,x_1, \ldots, x_n)=f_2(t,x_1, \ldots, x_n) = \cdots = f_n(t, x_1, \ldots, x_n)=0$ in $n$ variables $(x_1, \ldots, x_n)$ and one additional parameter $t$. Suppose that these equations have finitely many solutions for some fixed $t_0$, and that we have computed good numerical approximations to them. If we then move $t$ on a specified path from $t_0$ to some other $t_{\infty}$, how do the solutions to the equations move? The idea is very simple: Discretize your path into a number of small steps $t_0$ to $t_1$ to $t_2$ etcetera and use the known solutions at $t=t_i$ as starting points for some sort of Newton's method like solution at $t=t_{i+1}$. In detail, this is a hard numerical analysis problem and you probably should not try to implement it yourself. This is your problem. Your equations are $f(x)=t$, where $x$ ranges over the Riemann surface $X$. Solve this equation for $t$ near $i$ (say), finding $N$ roots, and compute the monodromy as $t$ travels in a loop around $0$ and in a loop around $1$, each time staying far from $0$ and $1$. This gives you two permutations in $S_N$. The map from the free group to $S_N$ sends the generators of the free group to these permutations. In short, I am saying that I don't think there is a method better than using the definition of the problem, but there is prepackaged software to implement that definition. 

Let $D$ be a positive square free integer; for simplicity let's take $D$ to be $2$ or $3$ modulo $4$. Then ideal classes in $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{D}]$ are in bijection with matrices $\left( \begin{smallmatrix} a & b \\ b & c \end{smallmatrix} \right)$ such that $ac-b^2=-D$, module the action of $SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$. Given such a matrix, consider the element $\theta := \frac{b+\sqrt{D}}{a}$ in $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{D}]$. (Since $D$ is not a square, $a$ is not zero.) So matrices of the sort we are interested in are in bijection with numbers $\theta$ of the form $\frac{b+\sqrt{D}}{a}$ such that $a | (b^2-D)$. When people discuss the continued fraction of $\sqrt{D}$, the set of such real numbers comes up, as it has the property that it is stable under translation by integers, and under inversion. (Which, now that I think about it, is just the $SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$ action. In fact, the relation between $\left( \begin{smallmatrix} a & b \\ b & c \end{smallmatrix} \right)$ and $\theta$ is that $(\theta \ 1)$ is isotropic for $\left( \begin{smallmatrix} a & b \\ b & c \end{smallmatrix} \right)$. So it makes sense that we have related $SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$ actions.) This makes me think there should be some way to relate the continued fraction behavior of $\sqrt{D}$ to the class group of $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{D}]$. This is probably some standard thing that every number theorist knows. Where do I read about it?
