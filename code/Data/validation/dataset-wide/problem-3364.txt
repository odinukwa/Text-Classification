The English sentence 'He runs' comprises two syllables. The Spanish sentence 'Corre' comprises two syllables. Both sentences mean the same thing, both sentences take about the same amount of time to say. (For the sake of the question, suppose they take exactly the same amount of time to say.) However, the English sentence comprises two words, whereas the Spanish sentence comprises only one. Can a native Spanish speaker comprehend the meaning of 'Corre' faster than a native English speaker can comprehend 'He runs'? More generally, all other things the same, does the number of words affect the time it takes a person to understand an utterance? 

Conflations My concepts of extension and of denotation seem the same. For example, it seems to me that the expressions pro-choice and pro-abortion[2] have the same extension[1], the same denotation, but different connotations. So denotation and extension seem the same to me. Similarly, my concepts of extension, denotation, and reference seem nearly the same, except that my concept of reference includes only expressions that represent unique and real referents. Also similarly, my concepts of sense and of connotation seem nearly the same, except that my concept of sense includes only expressions that represent unique and real referents. (E.g. Bruce Wayne and Batman are two senses of the same referent.) Questions 

i. Justin knitted Mary some outfits. ii. Justin knitted some outfits for Mary. Is there a difference in the thematic roles of the italicized constituents of these two sentences? They both look like beneficiaries to me. However, I'm not sure whether they're the same. 

Notes [1] Some meaningful expressions may not comprise all components necessary to state anything true or false. (I.e. unsaturated predicates or arguments). Logicians and linguists use variables to represent an absent component, such as in ∃x(Px), where only P has a stated interpretation. In such a case, the intension of the expression ∃x(Px) is that [[∃x(Px)]] is true iff it is true that x exists and that the interpretation of P is true of x. [2] I acknowledge that, strictly speaking, [[pro-choice]] ≠ [[pro-abortion]]. I disregarded that fact for the sake of the example. 

The 'sentence' above will seem odd if not ungrammatical to most English speakers because the verb like usually requires an Object. Such an Object is missing from the phrase above. We cannot use like with its normal meaning without a Direct Object in a straightforward clause: 

The sentences above are well-formed with or without the phrase at four o'clock. Notice that we can stick this type of phrase on the end of just about any sentence regardless of the verb in the clause. There is no special relationship between PUT and the preposition phrase at four o'clock. Very importantly for the discussion here, Adjuncts can take many different forms. For example, they can be adverb phrases, preposition phrases or noun phrases: 

Again, how you wished to measure the 'distance' of the dependency relationship would depend on what exactly you were trying to show. 

In short we need to be careful about confusing word categories and functions/grammatical relations. These two things are entirely different. 

A double vertical bar is often used in transcriptions to indicate a major intonational phrase boundary, and a single one to indicate a minor one. 

Here we see the word who occurring directly to the left of the nucleus (the main body) of the clause containing the gap. The long string that awful nit-picking man with the bobbly hat and the stripy shoes is just the subject of the verb punch. Because it is long it has moved the gap further away from its antecedent who. But nonetheless, the word who occurs here directly behind the very clause containing the gap. We can compare that to (5): 

In reality, with many of these constructions there are practicalities which make multiple embeddings difficult to process, for which reason sentences like (7) are relatively rare. So, if we wanted to somehow measure how long-distance the dependency between the gap and its antecedent was in a particular sentence, we would most likely want to quantify this in terms of the number of embeddings involved—in other words the number of clause boundaries intervening between the gap and it's antecedent +. The number of words is usually of less interest to us. If we did want to measure the intervening material though, we might want to measure it in terms of syllables, not letters, characters, words, or phrases. 

Latin reached Spain after Italy for obvious reasons. Norma della Fase Sparita (Disappeared form) This is not a geographical norm, rather it states that if we have two phases/forms and one of them died or is about to, and the other one survives, the first one is usually the early form. 

What is the current situation? In other words, was a consensus reached? I understand this is hard, but who knows. Also, what are the most important papers/resources about this topic? 

As Cerberus told you in his comment, we can't really be 100% sure. Well, if we had the chance to go back in time and collect every written material then we could have a chance but that's impossible, for now. What we can do is study the material that got to us and formulate hypotheses using that material. Old English was roughly between the V (5th, 400 AD) and the XII century (13th, 1200 AD), when it was already mostly developing into Middle English. But these are arbitrary dates. I mean, Old English didn't suddenly start at the V century. That is the date where we're sure it was already enough present and that it had those certain features that we attribute to Old English. And not to mention that what we call Old English for simplification was actually a co-existence of four dialects: Mercian, Northumbrian, Kentish, and West Saxon. The one that emerged, for political reasons, was this last one. The changes occurred between this period of time and the XV century on the language were so deep and drastic that they make this old phase of English basically incomprehensible to the typical speaker of Modern English. Pick a piece from the Beowulf and ask a native that hasn't studied to read it and tell you what it's saying: he won't be able to do it because they are really different. So what material do we have? Alfred the Great by the IX century, who favored the union of the various kingdoms/regions, also favored the "english" culture through two measures. An educative program focused, on one side on the study of Latin for the ecclesiastics, and on the other side on providing the most significative texts for translation. Thus the Anglo-saxon prose was born through translating texts: 

They can be very similar to and sometimes the same as main clause or subordinate clause open interrogatives: 

In the sentence above from the Robocop films the word somewhere is functioning as a Locative Adjunct. Notice that it can appear either at the beginning or end of the clause: 

Not only do many languages have wh-prepositions, English itself has at least two wh-prepositions. These are the words when and where, which, although classified as adverbs in traditional grammars, are recognised as prepositions by such grammars that allow for intransitive prepositions (for example, The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language, Huddleston & Pullum, 2002). The words when and where pass all of the tests for preposition-hood in English and none of the tests for being an adverb. In relation to the sentence: 

However, there are more complex constructions where we do see strings like I like without any overtly expressed Direct Object: 

(In the sentence above we might not feel that Bob has moved to the beginning of the clause from another position, exactly. It is more as if a second Bob has been deleted from the end of the smaller clause. Again, this would depend on what kind of grammar you subscribe to.) Now it is the relationship between these gaps and the words or phrases that they depend on for their interpretation which we refer to as long distance dependencies. Why do we call them long distance dependencies? Well, for one thing, these gaps are non-adjacent to their antecedents. We could suppose that we could measure the distance between the antecedent phrase and the gap itself to see how long distance this dependency was. So consider the following sentences: 

Languages like Japanese traditionally used vertical writing systems where the columns proceed from right to left: 

Here the subscript (i)'s are there to show that our interpretation of the word it is co-indexed with the word elephant. They refer to the same thing. So now we can model our relative clause sentence like this: 

1: Sardinian is not a "single" language but has countless varieties, usually changing from town to town. Being the more different the farther you go from a certain location. 

Languages change, it's inevitable. Even an almost geographically isolated language will change: maybe in a limited way, or at a slower pace, but it will. Some changes are more visible and happen in a shorter time, like acquisition of vocabulary through loaning or calques, but other changes will take more time, like sound shifts and so on. However, I'm not sure what you mean by "evolution of tenses", as in how verb tenses are conjugated? They will change at some point, but it might take more than a human lifetime to do so, and that's probably why from your point of view, the language seems "immobile". In short, there is no reason to think a language has stopped evolving completely. 

Add-on: By the way, seeing that others include the explanation of deictics, I thought I'd include it too. I didn't mention it because it didn't seem fundamental to answer your question, but it can add value to the discussion. Like others said, we have deictics in languages. They are highly dependent to the context, and if you listen to an audio conversation, they might represent a problem if you want to fully understand that dialogue. I had some notes about this matter: "Deictic" comes from the Greek word for "pointing" or "indicating". It is reference by means of an expression whose interpretation is relative to the context of the utterance, such as: a) who is speaking b) the time or place of speaking c) the gestures of the speaker d) the current location in the discourse e) the topic of the discourse If near speaker, proximal terms are used (this, here, now); if away from speaker, distal terms are adopted (that, there, then). Speakers and hearers constantly adjust their internal registry of deictics to keep up with the conversation. Traditionally, by deixis is meant the location and identification of person, objects, events, processes and activities being talked about, or referred to, in relation to the spatiotemporal context created and sustained by the act of utterance and the participation in it, typically, of a single speaker and at least one addressee; we can analyze them this way: 

The Original Poster's question The Original Poster is right that the word the is a function word. Because it is an auxiliary, the verb BE should be regarded as a function word too. The Original Poster is a skilled English pronunciation enthusiast (this question comes from a book on pronunciation). The verb BE behaves like a function word in terms of pronunciation too. The verb BE, like many other function words usually doesn't take stress, although like other auxiliaries it is always stressed when part of a negative contraction: 

In the sentences above we see the negative particle occurring attached to the auxiliaries. When not contracted it must occur directly after the auxiliary in canonical negative sentences. Notice how the verb BE is fulfilling this function even though there is no following verb. Inversion There are several instances in English when we need to invert the subject and auxiliary verb. The most obvious is in yes/no questions. Obviously we can only do this if there is an auxiliary! When there is no normal auxiliary in the declarative counterpart sentence we use the auxiliary DO: 

The term "gerund" is a fudge. It is used as if it was a subcategory of verb, when in fact, of course, it is just a particular inflected form of a given verb. Worse than this, this pseudo part of speech, in English at least, is actually 25% a part of speech and 50% a grammatical function label. The reason for this is that people who differentiate between "gerunds" and "participles" (meaning, with regard to English, "present participles") do so on the basis of the words' grammatical relations. So whenever this form of verb is the head of a clause used as a subject or object of a verb or the complement of a preposition, they deem it a gerund. Whenever it is the head of a clause used as a modifier or as the complement of the verb BE in a continuous construction, they deem it a participle. Of course this is to try and differentiate a different form of a verb according to its grammatical function and not its form. Modern English grammars such as The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language (Huddleston & Pullum, 2002) deem this distinction unjustifiable, and refer to such inflected forms as gerund-participles regardless of their grammatical relations. Notice though that this is a label like plain form or past participle and does not refer to a part of speech in any way. Notice that gerund-participles are verbs regardless of whether they function as a subjects or objects or modifiers. For example, unlike nouns they take objects:
