As I train various muscle groups, I've noticed that I cannot flex a few of them the way I would biceps or quads. The flex becomes painfully tight verging on a muscle cramp before I finish the range of motion. Potential causes I thought of: 

One internet poll reported that around 33% of women do this. The practice does have at least one benefit in that workout clothing -- especially bike shorts -- is much better at wicking away moisture than many types of women's underwear. 

Many people probably do this poorly because they haven't learned to hip hinge. I would guess that the more severe your tendonitis, or the more your thigh bone is positioned to create this stress, the more important vertical shins will be. Do your best and use your knee pain as a guide to whether it's good enough.

I can put my legs in the position for a ballet wide plie, but when I'm squatting up and down in that position in the context of a fast-paced Zumba-like dance class, I feel like my hips are going to fall out of their sockets. What's a safe way to develop a range of motion for this move, with flexibility and muscle control? I'm not sure if I need a new stretch I don't know, strengthening exercises, or some kind of ballet dance drill. 

So the specific kinds of exercises I recommend are about learnable skills rather than endurance. Weight lifting for movement patterns. Ice skating, trail hiking, or yoga for balance (very important for 70-year-olds, very tough to teach your body to use hip muscles when you've been relying on your ankles for years). Dance for coordination. Cross-training in general. You won't ever get huge or marathon-ready if you flit from skater squats to skiing to dumbbell rows, but you will find that every exercise program has something to teach you. You've got thirty years, there's time to spend three months on everything. 

Sometimes, this does go away if you train the muscle with weight so your nerves and muscle fibers can work better together. (personal experience) Another possible cause for painfully tight flexing is an overshortened muscle. Muscles that cross two joints enter active insufficiency when both joints are flexed together. For example, if you flex your bicep by your side and then raise your elbow, you can feel the flex in your bicep getting tighter and tighter, because the biceps crosses both the elbow and shoulder joints. To avoid this (and it's not a good way to train a muscle, because the muscle is weak in this position), stick to exercises with more natural body motions instead of trying to flex muscles in isolation. In natural body motions, muscles that cross two joints always relax at one joint if they're pulling on the other. 

This CDC Paper Tai Chi Principles for Fall Prevention in Older People lists some reasons why tai chi would be more helpful for older people than it would be for you: 

When lying down and needing to sit up, I either push myself up with an elbow, or bring my knees to my chest and then kick out, creating the momentum to propel myself up off the couch. I checked a yoga book at the library and saw that sitting up without hooking your toes under something is called a "roll-up". Is this a widely attainable skill? My motivation for the question is that I have difficulty just sitting up straight on the floor (like a 100%-supported L-sit), so I wondered if I was far below average in this area. 

I have no difficulty tilting my pelvis in a seated or standing position, or in a quarter squat when my body is upright. When my upper body is tilted forward 30 degrees, however, curling my tailbone forward for a posterior pelvic tilt leads to a familiar juddering that I recognize as the sign of a poorly coordinated muscle group. Does a different muscle take over in this position, or are the spinal erectors pulling the pelvis in an anterior tilt direction and not being very good at relaxing? I don't think it's an issue with hip flexibility, my hip hinge is fine. 

I fail to see why the base of the foot being flat should cause the leg to tip over, rather than being a normal leg that just has more of the sole of the foot on the ground. If your hip, knee, and ankle are misaligned like the following image, then I think you should work on the knee valgus. Use Bret Contreras' diagnostic tests to see whether your valgus is caused by ankle mobility, hip mobility, or lack of coordination. 

I found plie squat kind of deceiving because watching someone do it from the front makes it looks like their legs are near 180, but every instruction I found online has you put your feet out at 45-degree angles. I'm not sure it's necessary to do more even if you can. 

Mark Rippetoe believes that DOMS is caused by eccentric muscle contraction, volume, and lack of adaptation. If working out more frequently doesn't help you adapt, then try doing leg exercises with no eccentric component, such as sled pushes. 

Now I feel bad, my suggestion for the question wording was kind of rude and changed its focus. A BMI calculation shows your diet wasn't minimal in calories -- you weren't underweight -- just in protein. If the joint pain is a result of your body consuming the proteins stored in synovial fluid, it should get better within a few weeks. To answer your original question, any exercise that does not hurt your joints helps them, because stronger surrounding tissue supports the joints. If elbows hurt doing push-ups, find an arm exercise that doesn't. And make sure you're not causing your own joint pain through Will Brink's list of common mistakes: 

Children love being lifted like kettlebells or "boinged" around the house like an overhead press. As the children grow, you'll naturally increase your resistance. If you don't have children, acquiring them can be a workout, similar to push-ups or (if you need a heavier weight than a newborn provides) a farmer's walk. 

I did not have good results after six weeks, but I feel my movement patterns have gotten better. Found a lot of little snaps and twinges that I got rid of. Identified some major stabilization issues with my right leg. Bodyweight is very functional training by its nature. 

You need to ask what caused this neurologically inhibited muscle and whether it still exists. Some say the cause is an antagonist that will not relax, which keeps the muscle from contracting completely. 

You will need warmups even when it's not a maximal effort. At age 38 I have had pain for days from lifting a 40-pound bike. I think learning how to warm up to prevent this was one of the most functional skills I learned in the weight room. You don't warm up for lifting your girlfriend by doing several sets with a nearby child, though. Simply warm up your upper body with some of these swimmer warmups (thanks John P), the lower body with these runner warmups, and the wrists with these wrist warmups. The key is learning from your injuries. Which warmups you must do or you'll get hurt, and even better, what's wrong with your movement pattern that made you get hurt in the first place. If I pick up my bike while using my lower traps to keep my upper back tight, I don't get hurt. So I just make sure they're warmed up before I start any similar lift. 

The Apley Scratch Test (aka zipper test, or Back Scratch Test) involves trying to touch your middle fingers behind your back, with one arm reaching back over the shoulder and the other reaching up from behind. How can I increase shoulder mobility (most likely scapular mobility) to be able to do this? What specific shoulder function is it testing? I can do it with my right arm, but not my left. Is it possibly a natural shoulder-blade alignment difference from being right-handed? Edit: Here is a video of me attempting the test. Even through my back hair, you can see my left shoulder blade moves differently right from the start. I believe this is a muscle issue because a muscle activation therapist massaged various muscles and I was able to touch my fingers on the left just as well as on the right... but only during that one session. I have not been able to achieve it with self-massage. Which muscle could be responsible for the difference? 

In this case once the muscle is no longer inhibited the joint should become stable and not require further intervention. That's just my take from Google, I could be wrong. 

The "thrown out" feeling is the body's emergency response to the situation "this joint has been forced beyond its range of motion! It's unstable and needs to be stopped now!" It activates all kinds of muscles with the goal of shutting down movement. But it doesn't work: the original feeling of instability was caused by the body not being able to stabilize normally, and muscle spasms don't help. Three reasons for the unstable feeling: 

I asked about this on Reddit. Ballet dancers call your ability to rotate your hips like this "turnout". Suggestions for improving your turnout include: 

Because of this, the kind of exercises that help are those that a) restore normal bodily function, or b) rebuild nerve connections between the brain and the body. For restoring normal function, you're looking at mobility exercises and basic movement patterns. For my upper back, that meant lower trapezius and serratus muscle training, and learning thoracic mobility. For my lower back, that meant learning proper form for deadlifts, Romanian deadlifts, and squats, then using them to identify weak points. Those weak points were generally addressed by learning about muscles that act on the hips and pelvis, such as the gluteus medius. For rebuilding nerve connections, you're looking at stretching, massage, and isolation exercises. Stretching is for the case when the brain is wrong and the source of the pain is not there any more. By moving the joint through its range of motion without pain, the brain learns the movement is safe. Isolation exercises are for finding movements you're shaky on, can't do at all, or do wrong, like raising your leg with overactive hip flexors instead of the iliopsoas. Repeating the exercise reinforces the nerve connection so that your body will recruit that muscle when needed, instead of compensating with others. Massage is for stimulating the nerves and blood flow enough that the brain can get a signal to and from the muscle and begin to re-establish the mind-muscle connection. Walking also helps a lot. Good luck! 

The page Teemu found links to $URL$ Here is what I get by eyeballing Figure 1, Metabolic energy cost of walking or running as a function of the gradient, figure B: Grade........ Energy used compared to flat -50%..........105% -40%..........100% -30%...........70% -20%...........60% -10%...........60% 0%............100% 10%...........170% 20%...........250% 30%...........360% 40%...........420% 50%...........550% 

This has been happening with various movements such as external hip rotation, shrugs behind the back, and torso twists -- small, seldom-used muscles. Should I just keep flexing them so the brain can learn to use them normally? 

The difficulty in falling asleep is because exercise raises your body temperature for two hours and you need a lower body temperature to sleep. I feel like weight lifting might produce less of this effect than cardio. You say you work out from 6-8:30 PM. If that means "for an hour inside that time window", try to make sure you start at 6, not 8:30. If that means "I am working out for 2.5 hours continuously", you should shorten your workout. That long of a workout puts too much strain on your body and your long-term motivation. Some professional athletes work out less than that. Working out less should mean less stimulation and more time to cool down for sleep. It won't hurt your results to exercise less, as long as you don't quit entirely. The calorie burn from exercise is not directly linked to weight loss. Typically your body just adjusts your hunger to make up for it. Exercise only helps by causing you to adopt the healthier eating patterns that reaching fitness goals requires.
