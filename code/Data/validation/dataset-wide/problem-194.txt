Honestly the tech to fly a city through the sky would probably be sufficient to simply put a city at a Lagrange point between the sun and the earth, or maybe even better, put a giant array of mirrors in space to reflect sun at the city perpetually. You would have he issue that the surface would never get a chance to cool down though. Mercury has sections that are pretty much in constant sunlight, and they can hit ~800F (430C). It would be less on the earth due to us bing farther away and having an atmosphere, but I doubt it would be comfortable. 

All sand is, is lots of tiny broken up rocks, and is created constantly by erosion. ( So if it doesn't exist, then either there's no erosion (no oceans, no running water) or no rocks. Rocks are created as a consequence of a planet existing and not being composed mostly of gases, so in order to not have rocks you'd need a very different type of planet from earth. Click here for a description of sand and its properties. Most importantly though, sand is composed of the same elements (including silicon) as most other rocks, and therefore even if there was no erosion to make sand, we could just mine the bigger rocks themselves - in fact, that appears to be mostly what we do. Sand is a mixture of a bunch of types of rock, and so it isn't very pure; it's more efficient to mine quartz and use that to get silicon instead. If we just didn't have much of the element silicon however, there are many other elements and compounds we could use as semiconductors, but it would probably have slowed down the expansion of the computer industry greatly (which was vital for space travel), but it all most likely would have happened anyway. Essentially the only thing that would have changed (if we magically pretend the lack of silica didn't impact much else) would be it would take longer (maybe double, but that's just a guess) for the technology of the world to change from what it was in the beginning of the 1900's to what it is today. So the answer is that we'd be living the same way people lived 80-100 years ago, which isn't quite all that much of a change, relative to some of the other question on here. The rich would still be able to afford computers though, so it's possible that it would've widened the cultural rift between the wealthy and the poor. But eventually someone would've found a different semiconductor that's relatively cheap, and that rift would be diminished again (similar to the effect of automobiles before and after the model T) 

7% of the population isn't very much, but some places would probably try to accommodate them. You definitely wouldn't need a runway, but most likely buildings would need some sort of open-ish area to let them take off and land. A more accommodating skyscraper might have ledges every couple dozen floors, to let the flyers land close to their desired floor, instead of having to land on the ground and travel up. They would also provide a great way for flyers to take off. It would, however, not be very cheap. So I believe the most common change would be to merge a parking space or two, fill it will dirt, and reserve it as a landing zone for flyers. If, however, the country this is in has a legal system similar to the USA's, then it might get more complicated. The landing zones might be very soft and squishy, to try to preclude anyone from getting hurt even if they land badly, the ledges might not exist, to preclude the possibility of someone landing poorly and falling off - and their family suing the building owners for not having made it safe enough. The legal aspect would also get interesting (no-fly zones, police searches in which the criminal could have simply flown away). All buildings which need any sort of security would have to completely change how they operate; they can't just rely on a tall barbed wire fence, but now also have to deal with the possibility of invisible (radar-wise) aerial intrusions. Maybe a giant cage built over the building would be sufficient. It also would make being searched much more difficult - if people can hide things in their crotch and try to sneak past security, imagine everything someone could fit inside their folded-up wings. I also imagine flying would take a good amount of exertion - if you're flying to work, and your job requires you to wear a suit, then you'd probably have to carry it with you and shower/change once you get there, and so buildings trying to accommodate flyers would need to make that possible. A different idea for taking off might be a big slingshot, but that would probably only be cost-effective in places like big cities where parking space is a premium. Though again that probably would never happen if the building has to worry about civil lawsuits. Also, flying in big cities might not even be allowed, given how easy it'd be to crash and cause damage, or flap around next to a windowed building and spy on/bother the people inside. Smaller places not in cities would probably have more roof access, from which a flyer could take off. Also, unless their wings are really compact when not extended, you'd probably have to provide larger doorways, hallways, taller stairwells (more clearance space above their head), and completely differently designed toilets (there'd have to be room for their wings between the seat back of the seat and the wall/tank/piping) If the people have similar reflexes when startled to other things with wings (i.e., they flap their wings to keep balance) then they might not even be allowed in the same public crowded spaces as everyone else - imagine one of them tripping in a crowd and shooting their wings out as a reflex. People would get hurt, it'd cause a huge disruption, people might get angry. Museums, jewelry stores, and similar places might not even let them in without some sort of clothing that prevents their wings from unfolding, to protect the items on display. 

The biggest one would be growth. If you build your house between two branches, then in some period of time, your house could easily be in two pieces. Or if you anchored it to one branch, it could be simply swallowed up by the tree's growth, depending on how the house is attached. Sunlight actually I don't think would be too much of a problem, unless the tree is extremely dense (coniferous trees, for example, might make it perpetual night). But with most other trees there's enough space for light to move around between the branches that you should be ok. It might lead to a sort of value system, where houses on the outsides of the tree, which have an actual view of the sun, are worth more than those which are on the inside and only get light that's been bounced around of few times first. People might try to build farther and farther up the tree, and farther and farther out on limbs, to make more expensive houses, but those houses would be quite unstable in any kind of wind, and the branches at either of those places are by definition much less strong than those near the trunk of the tree. Leaf collection would indeed be a big problem, but the nature of the problem would change depending on whether this is a huge normal tree (leaves are normal size, the tree's just really old) vs. if its simply a huge version of a tree (and the leaves are scaled up to match). In the first case, you might be able to simply build a roof over every area, sloped enough to make the leaves slide off, but for the second a single leaf might be able to crush something, and you probably wouldn't want to live in a tree which shed leaves. Maybe an old dead tree would work. Fire, obviously, would not be something you want to break out in this city. Small ones can be controlled, and even a house fire might not be able to break through the tree's bark before it went out, but some magic systems include the ability to make fires which can't be put out - and those would make short work of your tree. Wind storms could be problematic for people and structures built on flexible areas of the tree. The more things get built on a branch, the more it sags, and the more it bends the structures already built on that limb. A slight misstep while walking would hurt (eventually, depending on the height of the tree). Children's games most often require a large open space to run and throw things, and its one thing when your baseball falls in the neighbor's lawn, but a completely different story if the ball falls a couple hundred feet down out of your tree. A large pavilion could theoretically be built to give them an area to play though. If any of the houses are actually cut into the tree, then you run the risk of eventually hurting/killing the tree if you go deep enough. Also again, if the tree doesn't die, then it's gonna keep growing and your house is going to change shape. Traffic (even foot traffic) would require a huge 3D spiderweb of roads bridges and stairs in order to facilitate movement between branches, and that would probably greatly increase the difficulty of people unfamiliar with that section of the tree to navigate around, find a friend, or catch a criminal on the run. I'd suggest the mages look into levitation. Also if it snows there, then you'd have to coordinate the shoveling of each person's house, so the guy at the bottom doesn't end up getting all the snow of the 25 houses above him dumped onto his roof.
