During the English renaissance, plays were primarily written for performance and play manuscripts were usually not sold to a printer before the play had had a successful run in the theatre. A number of plays have survived in manuscript form, e.g. John Bale's King Johan (rediscovered in the 1830s), Thomas Heywood's The Escapes of Jupiter, Philip Massinger's The Parliament of Love and Believe as You List, The Second Maiden's Tragedy (contested authorship), Richard Brome's The English Moor, Sir Thomas More (collaborative work, possibly containing Shakespeare's only surviving literary manuscript). Apparently, some researchers also include Thomas Heywood's The Captives and Walter Mountfort's The Launching of the Mary (see Manuscripts and their Makers in the English Renaissance). Some of these are part of the British Library's MS Egerton 1994, but not all the manuscripts in this collection are considered autographs. So how many English Renaissance plays (roughly from years the 1550 – 1625) have survived in manuscript form? (These manuscripts can be in the handwriting of the original authors or contemporary copies.) I am not asking for an exhaustive list of plays but a source that discusses the (number of) surviving manuscripts. 

In a postscript to the English translation of Liu Cixin's The Three-Body Problem, Ken Liu drew attention to his approach to the translation work. Ken Liu writes that "differences in linguistic structure and cultural references, are actually easy to resolve". In some cases, he used footnotes for this. (The German translation has endnotes for most of the same names and concepts.) However, Ken Liu also pointed out that (emphasis added) 

The epic poem can't simply be equated with the chivalric romance, but some of the criticism would also apply to epic poems. In addition, Cervantes published a parody on chivalric romances (especially Amadís de Gaula) that became a great success: El Ingenioso Hidalgo Don Quijote de la Mancha (volume 1 in 1605, volume 2 in 1615). With this background, Milton's epic poems Paradise Lost (1667) and Paradise Regained (1671) are exceptions. That does not mean there have no epic poems since Milton. However, Alexander Pope's The Rape of the Lock and Byron's Don Juan (1819–1824) are satires on the genre. Two more recent, non-satyrical, examples are Christopher Logue's War Music and Omeros (1990) by Nobel Prize laureate Derek Walcott. 

Robert Louis Stevenson lived from 1850 to 1894, so the following poets are candidates for the answer: 

I have been browsing through A Glossary of Tudor and Stuart Words, Especially from the Dramatists by Walter W. Skeat (completed by A. L. Mayhew and published in 1914). It contains several entries that should sound familiar to readers of J. R. R. Tolkien's work. For example: 

So whether Rosencrantz and Guildenstern "deserve" to die depends on whether you look at it from a medieval point of view (including Saxo Grammaticus) or not. We can find a condemnation of revenge both in the English Renaissance and in our own age. However, Hamlet's plot against Rosencrantz and Guildenstern is probably not so much a question of whether it can be justified, as an illustration of something else: that Hamlet can kill on the spur of the moment or when he sees his own life in danger (Polonius; Rosencrantz and Guildenstern (see V.II.29ff: "Being thus be-netted round with villainies/..."); and finally Claudius) but not when he has time to think about what the consequences are (e.g. he does not kill Claudius during his prayers, because the King would then die repentant and go to heaven). 

In 2016, Bantam published a A Game of Thrones: The Illustrated Edition with a hard cover, a foreword by John Hodgman, maps by Jeffrey L. Ward and illustrations by Michael Komarck and Michael S. Miller. (See e.g. Amazon.de.) In the same year, Harper Collins UK published A Game of Thrones. 20th Anniversary Illustrated Edition, also with a hard cover, a foreword by John Hodgman, maps by Jeffrey L. Ward and illustrations by Michael Komarck and Michael S. Miller. (See e.g. Amazon.de.) Both editions are 896 pages long. Are these two editions just the American and the British edition of the exact same book, or are there any differences that I overlooked? 

To my knowledge, the only Elizabethan or Jacobean play that is a sequel to a Shakespeare play is The Woman's Prize, or the Tamer Tamed by John Fletcher, a play that was first performed in 1609 – 1610. The play is a mock sequel to Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew. In The Taming of the Shrew, Petrucio "tames" Katharina. In Fletcher's "sequel", Petruchio is a widower again and remarries, but this time he is the one who gets "tamed" by his wife Maria. The play is also interesting for other reasons: its performance was prohibited for some time by the Master of the Revels until some adaptations were made, and it has survived in manuscript form (unlike any of Shakespeare's plays, unless you count Shakespeare's presumed contribution to Thomas More). I also looked at the description of Ben Jonson's masque Oberon, the Faery Prince (performed in January 1611), but apart from the character Oberon, it has too little in common with Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream to count as a sequel. 

Whether you think Rosencrantz and Guildenstern deserve to die depends to some extent on the moral framework you use. When writing Hamlet, Shakespeare was working in the tradition of the revenge tragedy (although the play is almost an anti-revenge tragedy) and he was using a story that ultimate goes back to a Nordic tradition. So there are several moral frameworks you can use: 

In Ursula Le Guin's Earthsea series of books and stories, there is a kind of hierarchy for people who practice magic: witches and sorcerers on one level, and wizards and mages on a higher level. Witches and sorcerers received no training on Roke. Witches and sorcerers are easy to distinguish, since witches are women and sorcerers are men. However, women cannot receive training on Roke, so wizards and mages are all men. While reading the first four books in the series (A Wizard of Earthsea, The Tombs of Atuan, The Farthest Shore and Tehanu), I got the impression that the terms wizard and mage are sometimes used to refer to the same person. Is this correct, or is there a distinction that I overlooked? 

I consulted the Dutch edition Het achterhuis: dagboekbrieven 12 juni 1942 - 1 augustus 1944 (Edited by Anne's father Otto Frank and Mirjam Pressler. Amsterdam: Prometheus, 2010). This edition of the diary does not contain an entry for 7 November 1942; there is nothing between the entries of 5 and 9 November 1942. However, there are four (!) versions of Anne Frank's diary: 

The diary entry for 7 November 1942 does not exist in version A; it is something that Anne added in version B. This is a long letter about how Anne's parents habitually side with her older sister Margot when there is some sort of conflict. This leads her to the question whether God is testing her and whether she should try to become "good" without guiding examples. This then leads to the paragraph cited in the question. The diary entries are written as letters to "Kitty"; in an early diary entry from 20 June 1942 (actually, the first entry in version B) that she did not have a true friend, i.e. someone with whom she could talk about intimate things, so her diary might serve that role. So the diary entries are not simply observations with a date above them but letters to the diary/Kitty with a salutation and a closing line. So the claim, in Yaskskier's answer, that "letters" in the quote refers to "letters of the alphabet" is factually wrong. (The Dutch word for "letter" in the sense of written message is "brief"; the Dutch word for "letter (of the alphabet)" is "letter", so there can be no mistake.) The statement that the letters will not be read by anyone refers to the fact that she would never let anyone read her diary (or "diary letters", as the title of the Dutch edition says). This statement comes from the 20 June 1942 entry (the first) in version B and therefore refers to version A. The comfort she does not get refers to her relationship with other family members. The 7 November entry also says that Anne is in many respects the opposite of her mother and asks whether anyone could really satisfy their children. She writes that she wants to improve herself in order to satisfy the demands by other people. She probably also hopes that this would help her overcome the unequal treatment of her and Margot. 

Although Vekzhivi's answer is not bad, I think I can add a few things. The spelling of "cristopher" varies between editions. For example, the Norton Critical Edition of the Canterbury Tales (edited by V. A. Kolve and G. Olson, 1989) has the following line: 

The moral framework of the Nordic tradition where the story originates (but to which Shakespeare probably had no access). The moral framework of the age of Saxo Grammaticus(c. 1150 – c. 1220). Saxo's Gesta Danorum contains the story of the downfall of Amleth, Prince of Denmark. The moral framework of the age of François de Belleforest, whose Hstoires tragiques contains a translation of Saxo's Amleth story (1570). The moral framework of Shakespeare's own age, which presumably also produced a now lost Ur-Hamlet that is often attributed to Thomas Kyd. (There are also many similarites between Thomas Kyd's The Spanish Tragedy and Shakespeare's Hamlet, such as a ghost, madness, and a play-within-the-play.) The moral framework of our own age, let's say of early 21st-century Western Europe. 

The persons mentioned in the book are partly real and historical—e.g. Huey Long, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Charles Coughlin—, partly fictional, e.g. the presidential candidates Berzelius "Buzz" Windrip (Democrate) and Walt Trowbridge (Republican). The book mentions a number of persons, organisations, etc. that modern readers are usually not familiar with, such as OGPU (the Soviet Union's secret police at the time), Julius Streicher, Béla Kun, Salvemini (actually Gaetano Salvemini) and Oswald Spengler's The Decline of the West. The book also mentions many persons, organisations, etc. that non-American readers may not be familiar with, e.g. Frank Buchman, Lothrop Stoddard, the Townsend Plan, the NRA (no, not that other NRA), FERA, the YMHA, GAR, Caspar Milquetoast. The abbreviations are not expanded; many of the names are probably also unfamiliar to many American readers today. The book also mentions many authors and book titles (novelists etc.); it is up to the reader to figure out how these names are relevant in the context where they are mentioned (which is almost impossible if you are not familiar with their works). It is usually clear whether a name is fictional or not, especially if you know a bit about the history of English literature. Wikipedia can be a great help, but the lists of names can become really long, for example when in chapter 22, Lewis lists celebrities and journalists that get arrested: Raymond Moley, Frank Simonds, Frank Kent, Heywood Broun, Mark Sullivan (not identifiable on Wikipedia), Earl Browder, Franklin P. Adams, George Seldes, Frazier Hunt, Garet Garrett, Granville Hicks, Edwin James (presumably this one) and Robert Morss Lovett. This is a single enumeration on the same page (p. 219 in Penguin's 2017 reprint). So there's a lot of name dropping and it is rather tedious to look up every unfamiliar or half-familiar name and book title just to make sure you aren't overlooking any hidden meanings and allusions. For this reason, I would like to know if there is an annotated edition of Sinclair Lewis's novel It Can't Happen Here that would meet the following criteria:
