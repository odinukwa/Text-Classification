The later doctrine of American exceptionalism seems to be a secularization of this idea: an exceptionalism based on civic virtues and the constitution rather than on love and grace. Modern liberalism generally is basically a secularized version of Christianity. 

My father was a professor of literature and I am reasonably confident that if he were asked this question he would say that the purpose of criticism is not to figure out what the author meant, but to fully understand and appreciate the nature of the experience that the work creates. He spent much of his career arguing for the superiority of the 1850 version of Wordsworth's prelude over the 1805. The 1805 version is considerably more liberal in its sentiments and it was preferred by many of the scholars of the day for that reason -- they considered it to be a better work because it expressed more liberal sentiments compared to the more conservative sentiments of the 1850 version. But my father's argument was not that the 1850 version was better because its politics were more conservative, but that it was better because it was better poetry; that its images were more striking and its emotions both more mature and more deeply felt. (I'm paraphrasing his argument wildly, but that seems to me, through the filter of memory, to be the gist of it.) I also remember an anecdote about Beethoven which I assume I must have heard from him. A woman came up to Beethoven after a concert and asked him what the piece he had just played meant. Beethoven answered by sitting down at the piano and playing it again. A piece of art, in other words, means itself, the totality of its experience, and nothing else. The purpose of criticism is both to judge the quality of the experience as an experience and to make the fullness of the experience more accessible to the reader. Of course, this is not the majority view among literary critics. But to me, the notion of a piece of literature as a covert polemic seems odious. I believe that a writer turns to fiction not to conceal an argument which they are very capable of making plainly, but to record an experience. Sometimes, in other words, what you want to say is not that the world should be such and such, but simply that the world is such and such, not how human life should be lived, but simply what the nature of human experience actually is. Experience, by its nature, cannot be conveyed in summary. It can only be taken whole. The meaning of a poem is the poem. The meaning of a novel is the novel. 

In this chapter Atticus talks to the children and tells Scout to be more ladylike and Jem to become more of a gentlemen. The children (being their age) do not properly grasp the context Atticus talks about and Scout begins to cry. When Atticus says 

There are a few 'blatant' differences that are obvious when reading both the books. Most of these aren't that difficult to spot once you read both the books. The blatant differences: Firstly, Atticus has changed. In "Mockingbird," Atticus Finch, Scout and Jem's father, is an honorable lawyer and perhaps better father who somberly defends African-American Tom Robinson at Robinson's rape trial."Mockingbird's" Atticus is so renowned that the ABA Journal headlined an article "The 25 Greatest Fictional Lawyers (Who Are Not Atticus Finch)." He tries to bear no ill will towards anybody, regardless of color. A member of a mob "is still a man." "I do my best to love everyone," he tells Scout in "Mockingbird." So it's a shock to encounter "Watchman's" Atticus, who serves on the local citizens' council and remembers his defense of Tom Robinson -- which, in "Watchman," concludes with a not guilty verdict -- with "an instinctive distaste." He's also a former Klan member, though he went "to find out exactly what men in town were behind the masks." (The Klan is alluded to in one "Mockingbird" line as a "political organization.") It's a challenge envisioning Gregory Peck -- who played Atticus in the 1962 "Mockingbird" movie -- playing this version of the attorney. He certainly would have given it a layer of darkness. However, this Atticus still loves his daughter. It's the question of whether his daughter can love him that forms the crux of the book. Secondly, Jean Louise is fully grown In 'Mockingbird': 

This, allowing for certain changes in rhetorical style over the years, could be Bernie Sanders. Except Bernie Sander would not likely quote Deuteronomy in support of this assertion. 

Remembering that Tolkien was Catholic, I would suggest that the meaning is not specifically or simply death, but rather the ability to rest in peace after death -- which in Catholic terms means to be reconciled with God. Thus I think the import of Frodo's question is whether or not Bilbo has been irredeemably corrupted by the ring. Though Bilbo's passage over the sea would constitute his resting in peace, I don't know that I would go so far as to call this a deliberate foreshadowing. It is all too easy to find associations in any text is you look hard enough. I would want foreshadowing to we written in a heavier hand than this before I called it by that name. 

The pants-wearing Jean Louise Finch of "Watchman" is more ladylike than the overalls-wearing Scout, but she still doesn't fit in with the demure women of Maycomb. She dislikes the town "Coffees" and obviously prefers the freedom of New York. "Good Lord, Aunty," she tells Atticus' sister, Alexandra, at one point. "Maycomb knows I didn't wear anything but overalls till I started having the Curse." The coming of age of "Watchman's" Jean Louise is starker. There are passages of her as a teenager, going on a date and defending her adopted Manhattan. Gone is the wonder of young Scout. Lastly, the timelines of the plot. Though "Watchman" dates from about 1957, its plot -- pitting the locals' defense of the South's old ways against Jean Louise's distaste for them -- is surprisingly topical given the recent controversy over the Confederate flag. The N-word is used with some abandon and Uncle Jack, in particular, tries to explain the region to Jean Louise as "a separate nation" that fought the Civil War "to preserve their identity." "Watchman" also has a distinctly modern feel compared to the Depression-set "Mockingbird." The roads are now paved, there are mentions of television and the city is coping with the strivings of returning veterans. It's a far cry from the sleepy village of the'30s. Source/Read more: $URL$ 

That is the tale he is planning to tell at parties later in life, but, as the previous lines have made clear, these sentiments are all bosh. There was nothing to choose between the roads and he has no idea if the choice he made made any difference at all. The problem with the poem seems to be that most of the readers get so caught up in the romance of those last lines that they fail to notice the plain statement that they are a piece of humbug. The words "with a sigh", particularly, emphasize the humbug of the words that follow. Why will he sigh? To make his words seem vaguely tinged with regret. It's an act. It is humbug. But we can't see it because we want the particular piece of humbug to be true. We want poems to have poetic ideas and poetic themes and the road less travelled is just what we think a poetic theme should look like. So obviously the poet must have meant those words seriously, and so the rest of the poem -- which if read plain is making it clear that those sentiments are humbug -- becomes difficult and mysterious because the conclusion does not seem to follow from them. Which is, I suppose, as good an illustration of the purpose of literary criticism. Not to elucidate some hidden meaning about forging your own path in life, but to point out that it is, on the plain face of it, describing not some momentous life choice, but the kind of humbug we tell ourselves and our friends about the significance of our choices. 

But usually it's mentioned casually, and the other characters certainly don't treat Prince Lev as some kind of royalty. What were princes, and about how many were there (100? 100,000?) in those times? Were they respected for this title? Or was it mostly an empty salutation? 

In Dostoevsky's The Idiot, the main character is Prince Lev Nikolayevich Myshkin. Sometimes the word "prince" almost seems an honorary title, e.g. 

Background I've just finished reading A Country Doctor's Notebook by Mikhail Bulgakov. I enjoyed each of the short stories, in particular because almost all of the stories wrapped up nicely, with a wholesome, "And all was well, ever after" feeling. Having read several modern collections of short stories (American Salvage, Once You Break a Knuckle, Interpreter of Maladies), which seem almost to compete at being the most cynical or disheartening, I was relieved to read Bulgakov and be reminded that not all literature had to be depressing. The thing is though, this isn't the first time I've felt this way about some Russian work. For example, Dostoevsky's retelling of the an elder's story in The Brothers Karamazov, namely Elder Zosima's youth as a soldier, throwing away his duel: what a joyous feeling that mini-story brought me! And also how the children came to love Ilyusha. And in The Idiot, I recall there being many such anecdotes surrounding the innocent Prince Lev. Perhaps I'm cherry-picking examples, but for some reason I just feel that Russian works I've read so far, are (or contain anecdotes that are) "folky," as if designed to be bedtime story for adults. Is this a "thing" in Russian literature?â€”Is there anyone here who's studied Russian literature or culture and can identify what I'm talking about? Self-Analysis Thinking a little more critically, I realize that I don't recall any such happy episodes in Crime and Punishment or The Possessed. (Which is not to say there weren't; it's been a while since I read them.) However, there were such stories in House of the Dead, despite its entire setting being a Siberian prison. Nabokov's Pale Fire I felt had this wholesome feel throughout, but more in a manic, unreliable-narrator way, so I'm not sure that counts. And I do not recall the feeling in Tolstoy's Anna Karenina, either. I did feel the adult-bedtime-story-ness in Nikolai Gogol's short stories, though. So should my thesis be changed to, "Why are short-stories and anecdotes in Russian literature just so damned nice?" The reason I ask this question is that I would like to present this thesis to my book club to encourage the readers to try some more Russian literature, but I don't want to spew B.S. originating from my own, patchy reading experience. But okay, where have I experienced this feeling outside of Russian literature? The way the children lifted Stephen and cheered, "Hur-oo! Hur-oo!" in James Joyce's A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, immediately comes to mind. But as I look at about 30 other non-Russian books I've read (from The Modern Library's Top 100), I only see one other book that fits the bill: in Willa Cather's Death Comes for the Archbishop, the way Father Latour found safety again and again, in desolation and hardship. That's 2 out of 30+ non-Russian books, versus around 5 out of 15 Russian books, giving me the warm fuzzies. Wrap-Up I'm tenatively convinced that it's possible that, for some reason, Russian authors are more predisposed to entwining small, warm, parable-like passages in their storytelling. I'm reaching out to find scholarly evidence of this, or at least, support (or refutes) from others who have read Russian literature extensively. (And if it really is a well-known, oft-discussed feature of Russian literature, then I'd like to know more about how this came to be. Did a handful of predecessors like Gogol cast a lasting impression?) Thank you. 

There isn't a wrong way to read it and notes from from later times do not spoil the plot from earlier times. I prefer reading all of the notes and the novel at once. However J.J Abrams himself has said 

after all they have no mother. Aunt Alexandra is shocked by Jem's description of Cousin Joshua and asks Atticus to speak to his children about their 

He was trying to reassure his children by suggesting that maybe he might cost the family money like Cousin Joshua. Scout however recognizes Atticus' efforts to comfort her and she understands what he was trying to do, she respects Atticus trying to comfort them but she realizes that he lacks a mothers ability to nurture their children as it does not come naturally to him. Scout is referring to the absence of their motherly role in their family more than being sexist or prejudiced.
