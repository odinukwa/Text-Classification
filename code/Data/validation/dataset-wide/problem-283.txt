The trick is to have senses that aren't strictly light/sound based. We already have such a device for sound waves: a laser microphone can "read" the sound waves striking a surface. Even needing to make the round trip, light is so much faster than sound that a laser microphone can "sense" sounds for a person long before those sounds actually get to that person (and, often, pick up sounds that would never get to that person). Light, of course, is trickier, given that it's considered the universal speed limit. So, what we have to look at is, what's faster than light? Nothing! So, how do we cheat? Wormholes can collapse the distance between two points. If the distance from the viewer's eye to the target was "collapsed" in this manner, then the viewer could experience visual input before anyone else nearby. Depending on frequency and location of use, opening wormholes can have a number of... side effects. Quantum Entanglement (also known as "spooky action at a distance") has been a popular haven in science fiction for this kind of effect (e.g., many "ansible" technologies). This spooky action has shown strange effects where "entangled" particles can influence each other instantaneously across distance. The problem with this is that entangling particles does not occur at a distance, the information transmitted is not at a macro level in the same manner as other sensory information, and the mechanics and limits of entanglement are not well known so any such solution will likely be subject to "science marches on" in a few years. Alternative: time travel. If you were able to transmit neural signals backward in time to yourself, you'd be able to pick up "normal" sensory input, feed it to yourself X [units of time] ago, and it would appear that you received that sensory information long before you could have received it. 

Sure, the Chancellor could go all gunslinger on them. But what if he's actually a Machiavellian negotiator? Assuming Securia exports roughly 18 billion [currency] monthly to Otherland, and imports roughly 23 billion [currency], that gives a 5B trade deficit with Otherland. What kind of trade deals could our good Chancellor work out? Let's say the Chancellor convinces Otherland to sign a trade deal where both sides tax imports at 10%. That's the result, but, of course, the agreement itself is 3,456 pages of dense legalize. Great for both governments, right? An extra 1.8 billion [currency] for the Otherland government, and 2.3 billion for Securia every month! This money can go directly toward securing the border. But wait, won't people in each country be angry that the goods suddenly got more expensive? Of course! But who cares about the people of Otherland? Let's focus on Securia. The new taxation will simultaneously reduce demand for Securian goods in Otherland (since they're now less affordable) and also reduce demand for Otherland goods in Securia (same reason). Trade will start to stagnate between the two countries as production bases switch to more profitable markets. This will be more painful for the smaller country (Otherland). This will be particularly true if Securia uses Otherland as a manufacturing/labor base, then "imports" things like electronics back into the country for sale. Securian businesses will move their factories to other impoverished countries that don't have such high taxation, resulting in widespread unemployment across Otherland. After a year or two of this, Otherland will become desperate. But they're trapped, since they agreed to the terms; it seemed like such a good idea at the time. And that's when Chancellor Vater offers them a way out. They've collected 20-40 billion [currency] during the time of this trade deal. If they want to back out of the agreement, all they have to do is "refund" that money to Securia. Bam! Wall money. And that's on top of the 25-50 billion [currency] Securia also collected in taxation. 

Mind-cloning is a physical problem, not an informational one A problem I see a lot in scifi with mind-cloning is that it treats the brain like a computer: you "read" the information out of it, then "write" that information into another brain as if brains were hard disks. Brains don't work like that. Basically everything about the brain is "stored" in the structure of the brain. This neuron is present: how many neurons is it connected to? What are those neurons? How do the associations between those neurons influence the thinking of the individual? To clone a mind, what you need to do is clone the exact physical structure of the brain, which gets extra difficult because it's constantly in motion. My best guess would be to record something like an hour of brain scans from the host, then try and hit the structural target at the same time you hit the "velocity" target for how the neurons are interacting at a specific point in time within that hour. You'd probably have your "state" at the start of the hour, then prod the brain in various ways until it reached a matching velocity near the end of the hour. (Or two hours. Or a day. Or whatever.) So, no, you don't have to solve the binding problem; you just have to figure out how to scan, and then form, the structure and motion of a brain at a specific point in time. That being said... If you have the technology to fully scan every neuron in a brain in motion, you'll solve the binding problem. 

Really, it all goes back to that famous quote, "If we have seen farther, it is only because we have stood on the shoulders of giants." If no one learns about those giants, it's hard to ever see any farther. In this kind of world, most people probably wouldn't even learn to read, let alone get the foundation in metallurgy, chemistry, math, and physics required to make something like a non-exploding boiler. And those that learn master-to-apprentice style still probably won't know how to write, so nothing will go beyond their own tiny bubble, and eventually those in the know will die. This one is particularly insidious when you realize that most organized educational institutions (in Western history, anyway) grew out of the church. (Why should everyone be literate? Because then they can read the Bible.) What would happen if the church stamped out schools instead? 

Deserts are just places where plants don't grow, and there are many reasons why plants wouldn't grow in an area. These include: 

They're already going away. There are currently around 2 billion personal computers in the world (the kinds of things with keyboards and mice). In contrast, there are about 6 billion devices connected to the internet not including personal computers. Devices that don't have a keyboard and mouse outnumber those with by 3-to-1, and we haven't yet included computers that don't connect to the internet. Current examples of alternative methods of input for computers: 

Short answer: human beings are not programmable, as such. Also, subliminal messages are not comprehensive. Long answer: You've already used two suspect terms in your premise: hypnotism and subliminal messages. Hypnotism is a real thing, don't get me wrong, but it comes with some important caveats: 

I believe the only currently domesticated animal that breaks this is the cat (breaks 1), and the domestication of the cat was a much longer process than, say, the cow and happened in a very different way. There's also a lot of evidence to suggest that dogs and cats basically domesticated themselves into our societies because the ones that rooted through our trash in a non-threatening way tended to survive better. For this reason, it's very unlikely we could domesticate things like bears (no social hierarchy). Lions have social hierarchies, but are a lot more aggressive and dangerous than wolves, so it's difficult to capture enough of them at a pre-industrial technology to even begin domesticating them. They're also more likely to view humans as competitors, not potential partners, like small cats and dogs did. Finally, they're somewhat difficult to breed in captivity and can't stand small enclosures. An example, the Americas have all manner of animals, but the Native Americans were only able to domesticate: guinea pigs, turkeys, chickens, dogs, alpacas, and llamas. Bears, buffalo, large cats, birds of prey, deer, and snakes might seem like things that would be advantageous to domesticate, but in reality it costs far too much, and most of it upfront. You're likely to get killed off by a neighboring tribe that isn't routinely wounded and wasting thousands of pounds of meat on unruly carnivores generations before your payoff occurs. Or, even, killed by your new "pets"; bears and lions have a ranging territory of dozens of square miles, so it's hard to keep them happy in a cage. A lot of my information comes from the fantastic book Guns, Germs, and Steel by Jared Diamond. Edit: Your clarification edit makes my "answer" more of a rebuttal of your premise than an answer to your question; I'll leave it available for future readers. 

Photosynthetic algae One of the first great extinction events of our world was the mass oxidation of the atmosphere by cyanobacteria (among other organisms). From the Wikipedia article: "For example, at today's rates of photosynthesis (which are much greater than those in the land-plant-free Precambrian), modern atmospheric O2 levels could be produced in around 2,000 years." What this means is, in 2,000 years, with no effort other than adding an Earth-like amount of plants, you could get the atmosphere you want. But how would we do better? Enter photosynthetic algae. On our world, algae is kept in check by filter-feeders (shellfish, for instance) and a lack of free nutrients. On your world, presumably there are no filter-feeders. So, dump acres of algae into the newly-forming oceans. A lot of accidental algae blooms are caused by fertilizer runoff into waterways, so add fertilizer. This would vastly reduce the time it takes to convert CO2 into O2. Figure out a way to clean this up after the fact, and you're golden. Either add filter feeders, or make them dependent on the fertilizer would be my strategies. Another possibility is base-six DNA. As long as you continue to supply the extra base pair in your fertilizer dumps, the genetically modified algae will survive. Stop supplying it and it dies almost immediately. (Thanks to Draco18s for the base-six DNA idea!) 

When a new piece of war technology is discovered, the question is not, "Is this, at all times, worth 2-3 guns," it's, "Under what circumstances can I deploy this to give myself a greater advantage or turn a certain loss into a key victory (or even turn the enemy's overwhelming victory into a pyrrhic one)?" 

Q1) Do domes, shield shapes and bubbles make the cut vs firearms based on their structure? To examine this, it's pretty easy to look at breastplate designs after firearms became a popular weapon. You'll notice that the breastplate is not a simple curve, but has a central ridge. The reason is to try and divert a projectile from its most probable trajectory. You're much more likely to be attacked from the front, so having armor in a wedge shape was important to deflect the projectile from the center of the body to the side. This comes at a risk (shots coming from slightly to the side will hit more straight on), but most shots most the time will have their effectiveness reduced. Q2) Can anyone tell me if there is a physics-based reason why these shapes/structures might be so popular in the first place? No, of course not. It just looks cool, and it makes simple sense. Since magical force barriers have never been battle tested, those criteria will determine what's going to be most popular, even if different shapes would actually be more effective. Q3) Is there any way magical shields could be improved by altering their shape/structure alone? Absolutely. The problem with a sphere/bubble is that any attack hitting it dead on with have to be stopped instead of deflected, and deflecting an attack takes a lot less force than stopping it. Further, a sphere/bubble with it's center on the person is most likely to be head dead on a lot, since people will be aiming for... the person in the middle. So, if the wizard knows where the attack is coming from, s/he can work to deflect it. If you've read any of the Dresden Files books, you'll notice Harry Dresden frequently uses his shields in a flat angle to deflect attacks coming from a specific direction. If you're getting attacked from absolutely every direction, a sphere can make some sense, but that is rarely the case. This means you can make shields designed to deflect attacks just enough to miss you from the direction you expect. You can also look at how fortifications changed following the rise of cannons. Straight and curved walls were terrible at deflecting cannon blast, so people started building star forts. This isn't a perfect transfer (much of the star fort design is to channel charging infantry into kill zones), but you can see how a modified star shape would be able to more effectively channel projectiles away from your body than a sphere, even when being attacked from every direction. The points of the stars can protect you from side shots that would threaten a simple wedge, and the shots that do hit a plane head-on aren't actually pointed at your body, so if they break through you still aren't dead. The biggest danger with the star shape is the concave points. But, since you aren't actually worried about charging infantry, you can have deliberate gaps here that lead to another interior star barrier that still channels projectiles away from your body. That way, there's no point in the shield that needs to stop a projectile, just redirect it. 

First of all, there's a historical president for this kind of commandment (Deuteronomy 22:11). More importantly, it becomes very difficult to make things like steam engines when you don't have alloys to work with. Admittedly, this will be lower-tech than you might want (iron armor/weapons only). While this might seem like it's giving away too much (heretics start mixing metals), this is the kind of thing people would otherwise do all the time on their own, so limiting it in any organized way would severely hamper development. It's also something that's very difficult to hide, since the result of mixed metals is typically readily apparent. Also, mixing two types of metals you can melt is easy; making a proper alloy that's useful is not. In particular, some alloys require very high temperatures to make properly, which can only be made with certain tools that are made with, you guessed it, other alloys. If you want something a little more abstract:
