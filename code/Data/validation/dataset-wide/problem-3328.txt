I would say this still isn't exactly "capitalization" because the capital letters don't correspond to a single lowercase IPA letter, but to a set of them (e.g., N might be used as a symbol representing the neutralization of both /n/ and /m/). Also, a transcription with archiphonemes is fairly definitely not phonetic (I don't mean to say that there is a clear line between phonetic and phonemic transcriptions, just that I think most people agree that no matter how blurry the line is, archiphonems are on the phonemic side, and maybe even beyond it i.e. on a "third" level). Use of capital letters in some practical orthographies based on the IPA The practical orthographies of some languages contain letters taken from the IPA (or from other similar phonetic transcription systems), and in this context, capitalized/uppercase letters often may occur. But these are not official IPA, just similar but distinct scripts. There are even some upper-case equivalents to certain letters of the IPA outside of the 26 basic Latin ones: while these uppercase forms are not part of the IPA, they are used in some alphabets like the "Africa Alphabet" (which has Ʃ as the upper-case form of ʃ, Ʒ as the uppercase form of ʒ, Ŋ as the uppercase form of ŋ, and some others). In the case of the glottal stop letter <ʔ>, there is some variation. It is used as a case-invariant letter in the orthographies of some languages, but there is also a pair of derived characters that are used as a cased equivalent in the orthographies of some other languages: uppercase <Ɂ> and lowercase <ɂ>. You can see more examples at the Wikipedia article Case variants of IPA letters 

It's generally assumed that you can't stick material of arbitrary length and near-abitrary content into the middle of a word. As mentioned in Yellow Sky's comment, we can say, in addition to "an apple", "a yellow apple", "a lovely, delicious yellow apple", and so on. "Of" is not analyzed as a head-marked possessive suffix for a various reasons. There are many contexts where "of" phrases are used where "of" is not directly after the head of a possessive construction. "Of..." can be used predicatively or used in coordination ("the well-being of the people and of the government"). Also, you can put a conversational aside before "of", like "the perception--which I think is false--of X as Y...". There are some real cases where it's unclear whether to analyze something as one word, but I don't think any of the examples you gave are of this kind. Some examples I know of that have actually been considered to cause some difficulty for analysis: 

I tried to think of possible reasons, and the only thing I could come up with is possible stress shift from an original Middle English concupiscént/concupiscénce (taken from the stress in French or in Latin concupiscentia) via the somewhat common pattern of putting secondary stress on alternating syllables. Whereas, presumably, the other -scent/-scence words either came into English at a later period, when word-final stress was no longer common, or their pronunciation was remodeled for some reason while that of concupiscence etc. was not. The OED's earliest citation is "c1340," spelled "concupyscens" which does seem earlier than the first OED citation for "adolescence" ("?a1425") or "pubescence" (?a1425). I also wasn't able to find any earlier attested use of an "-escence" word in the Middle English Dictionary quotations. Even if nobody knows about these specific words, I would appreciate any more general information on the stress patterns of words ending in -ence or -ance in Middle English, and how they may have changed in the development to present-day English. 

These two words are actually cognate with each other; they show the differing reflexes in Greek of labiovelar consonants. In the noun ζωή zōē and the corresponding adjective ζωός zōos, the initial ζ developed from a cluster with the semivowel y; the noun βίος bios shows the normal development of PIE *gʷ before the full vowel /i/. The Online Etymology Dictionary's entry for the (English) prefix bio- also lists an assortment of cognates in other branches of Indo-European: 

Certainly. There are many Australian languages with a lot of coronal POAs for stops; dental, alveolar, and retroflex stops are generally differentiated, in addition to a palatal/alveolo-palatal series. This was apparently historically true of Tamil, although not so much for the modern language. I believe it also occurs in other Dravidian languages. Australian languages rarely have sibilants (and those that do don't seem to contrast many POAs for them). I don't know of any languages with a straight-up dental–alveolar–retroflex contrast for sibilants. However, Basque contrasts lamino-dental sibilants, apico-alveolar sibilants, and palatal/postalveolar sibilants. 

In Attic Greek inherited /w/ was lost. Piotr Gąsiorowski explains in the comments here how βίος and ζωός developed from the same Proto-Indo-European root: 

(p. 74) I'm not sure what evidence the detailed description that Hualde, Nadeu & Simonet give of the stages of the sound change is based on. Maybe someone else will be able to say more. Some other SE posts with relevant information: 

"Is it actually impossible for humans to pronounce a plosive at the end of a word?" No, not at all. In French, word final plosives often have audible release (I just say "often" because I only have an intermediate level of proficiency and don't want to make too absolute claims; this may be understating things). I'm talking about words that end with a consonant in the phonology, not in the spelling. E.g. the word "tape" in French is generally pronounced [tap] with one syllable ending in a released /p/. A disyllabic pronunciation [ˈtapə] exists, but is not usual except for in poetry/singing or in southern France, so I usually see it transcribed phonologically as /tap/ (although it seems that some more abstract analyses of modern French make use of the idea of some kind of underlying final schwa in words like this). Also, there is a difference between "no audible release" and "not pronounced". A plosive with no audible release is pronounced: the articulators make contact in the same place as for an audibly released stop. As you mentioned, the plosive is likely to affect the pronunciation of the preceding segment(s), allowing a listener to identify the place of articulation of the plosive. This is somewhat like how some languages have geminate stops at the start or end of a word, even though gemination is not always audible in these positions (I am thinking of Swiss German in particular). 

Yard, bard, computer, paradise are all considered to be English words. You can find each of them listed in an English dictionary, non-italicized, with no usage note saying they are words in another language. The phrasing "inherited word from a Celtic substrate" is weird. "Bard" would just be called a borrowed word, not an inherited word. (Of course, Modern English has inheritited the word from Middle English, but Middle English would not be said to have "inherited" this word from Celtic, because Middle English is not descended from Celtic). If a substrate influence was far enough back, the word might have been in the language already at some reconstructed proto-language stage. In that case, we might consider a word to be e.g. "inherited" from Proto-Germanic, but "borrowed" since the language developed from Proto-Indo-European. A possible example like this is "path", which has cognates in other major Germanic languages but is considered to have been borrowed into Proto-Germanic, not descended from PIE. This borrowing is not thought to be from a substrate (as far as I know, we don't know much about any substrates of the Germanic languages) but it's kind of comparable. In a discussion of Indo-European historical linguistics, the only word out of these four that woud be classified as "inherited" (implied: inherited from Proto-Indo-European, or possibly just from Proto-Germanic) would be "yard". 

As these last comments indicate, in the generative Minimalist Program, the idea of recursion in language is connected to the idea of "Merge". 

I don't have a reference for this answer, but I thought I might as well post it rather than putting it in a comment. This probably sounds stupid or sarcastic, but: because it's shorter than saying the names of all the letters each time you want to talk about the alphabet. Even in English, people talk about children "learning their ABCs" to imply learning all the letters of the alphabet. Much quicker than saying "learning their ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZs". For numbers, we have the parallel phrase "123s." You'd be in trouble if you tried to list all of the numbers. There are other conceivable ways to refer to an alphabet, such as just using a word like "letters," but giving examples to stand for a larger class of things is common in forming expressions. Another example: the expression "(not) one jot or one tittle" comes via Latin from Greek, and is believed to refer to features of the Aramaic alphabet. It's used to refer to express a sense of completion by listing two examples of letters or writing features that will not be left out; other letters are implicitly included. Yellow Sky's answer lists another reason that I thought I'd elaborate on here. It's possible that after the name "alphabet" became established in Greek, this influenced the naming of later writing systems. There are very few times when writing has been invented independently; in fact, "alphabets" in the narrow sense (scripts that systematically mark both consonant sounds and all types of vowel sounds) are pretty much all descended from or designed with knowledge of the Greek alphabet. 

After looking through the linked comments a bit, a few more observations that I think might help. You say 

The pronunciation of "baked" is actually a special case in English. English phonotactics do not allow /t/ and /d/ to contrast at the end of a word when there is a preceding voiceless obstruent (a sound like /k/, /p/, /f/, /s/), so the suffix spelled "-ed" is realized as /t/ in this context (and /d/ in other contexts). This is a type of neutralization, as described by user6726, and the realization of the neutralized segment as a voiceless sound can be explained as the result of "assimilation" in voicelessness to the preceding voiceless phoneme. But /t/ and /d/ do contrast at the end of a word in other contexts in English: there is a clear difference in pronunciation, easily heard for a native English speaker, between words like "meld" and "melt", or "lend" and "Lent". On the other hand, it is well known that in some European languages, such as standard German and Dutch, there is a "neutralization" between voiced and voiceless obstruents word-finally no matter what the preceding sound is. A typical example is standard German "Rad" and "Rat": they are considered to be homophones. This is often treated as the result of a phonological rule that causes consonants to be recategorized as "devoiced" or "fortis" or something like that at the end of a word, although in some languages, such as Dutch or Russian, the situation is complicated by the fact that the neutralized sound may in fact be voiced, not voiceless, if it occurs in the middle of a phrase before a voiced obstruent (in the onset of the first syllable of the next word). I found a paper that talks about this phenomenon in Dutch: "Final Devoicing and Voicing Assimilation in Dutch Derivation and Cliticization," Janet Grijzenhout & Martin Krämer Another complicating factor is that apparently, in these languages, word-final neutralization of voicing contrasts is often "incomplete" in the sense that careful measurements may reveal some kind of differences in production that are just too small to be perceived by human listeners. See e.g. "The Nature of Incomplete Neutralization in German: Implications for Laboratory Phonology," Bodo Winter and Timo Röttger. This seemed very surprising to me when I first read about it, but I believe I have read about similar cases of a mismatch between production and perception of word-initial or word-final geminate/long consonants in some languages. It's not obvious to me if this is relevant to a theoretical analysis of the phenomenon of devoicing. 

Welsh had its own intervocalic lenition processes, actually, so I don't know if the form of the Welsh word llyfr tells us much about the pronunciation of the Latin source word. 

As you're already aware, in one sense, this could be said to be just as trivial as any other terminology issue. Some people use one definition, other people use another, and it doensn’t really matter as long as you know what definition each person uses. I think it's silly to argue that English language learners cannot benefit from questions and answers about orthography. The way linguists define language has to do with certain ideas about "linguistics" as a scientific discipline, and what its proper object of study should be; I don't think it's very relevant to people who aren't trying to study language scientifically. I think to linguists, the most important characteristic of "language" is its universality: in every known human culture, language exists and is universal among healthy adults. All healthy children successfully acquire language somehow. Speech is related to it: everyone agrees that speech is somehow related to “language”. Writing is obviously related to speech, and since I think “related to” is transitive, I think we can actually say for sure that writing is related to language. But as you’ve noted, some people don’t like to say that writing “is” language. Why might this be? Well, for one thing, writing is very obviously not universal. Also, as far as I know no child acquires writing before acquiring language in some other modality. Obviously adults who already have acquired language can learn how to read or write some other, non-native tongue without learning how it sounds (although my impression is that empirical inquiry shows this to be a sub-par strategy for gaining competence), but that's irrelevant. Now, this doesn’t actually prove that writing can’t be part of language. But if language is universal and writing is not, it follows that the existence of language does not depend on the existence of writing, or come from it at the level of the individual. Pretty much all evidence also points to language being older than writing historically. Another reason for stressing the unimportance of writing to language might be to counter a misconception that I think is thought to be common among laypeople: the idea that speech is a debased or degraded derivative of writing, or that writing is closer to language than speech is. (If people do tend to have this idea, it might be because it’s common in literate societies for individuals to encounter words in their written form before ever hearing them spoken.) And one easy way of stressing that “language does not come from writing” is to say “writing isn’t language”. Anyway, so I said that it’s important that language is universal, but what is it? As far as I know, we don’t really know for sure (in an interesting way, beyond the obvious). We know bits and pieces, but not the whole thing. That's why there's such a diversity of theories. We can get data about language from both speech and writing. Some theoretical reasons for preferring speech over writing as a source of data about language is that speech is much more commonly used, on both a personal and a societal level, and it’s the first and most robust thing children acquire (and language acquisition is one of the important fields of study). Some theoretical reasons for preferring writing over speech as a data source is that it’s easier to collect written data than it is to collect spoken data, and writing generally has more examples of complicated structures than speech (some kinds of complicated structures basically never occur in spontaneous speech; although then again, there are also different viewpoints about the value of linguistic data from spontaneous sources vs. linguistic data that is consciously created). The study of punctuation &c is hardly the only thing that can be distinguished in this manner from the study of “real language”. There are also facts about spoken language that are likely to seem (theoretically) uninteresting to many linguists (= language scientists); which specific facts these are probably differ based on the linguist, but for example, there’s a remark Noam Chomsky made comparing sociolinguistics, which mainly deals with observations about variation in speech, to butterfly-collecting; his point as I understand it is that natural science involves the description of important theoretical principles rather than the cataloguing of facts about the natural word (which Chomsky calls “natural history”).
