Yes. Consider a warm, rapidly spinning world and a big mountain range in the right place. One big driving force behind weather is the fact that the air at the equator is moving much faster than the air at the poles, the faster the planet spins the greater this effect is. Thus a rapidly spinning planet is a windy planet. Since it's warm we have a lot of moisture in the air over the ocean. The wind drives that moist air into the mountain range, it rises, cools and drops it's water. It rains as long as the wind blows. 

Your couple is probably going to be in for the culture shock of their lives when they return. They probably have no marketable skills, although it very well might be that they end up in a basic income type society and that's not too big a deal. It's also possible that they end up on the far side of the singularity, what they find then is inherently beyond our ability to predict. Some fundamental breakthroughs are going to be needed before this is even possible, thus what technology or when is beyond our ability to predict. While we can at least envision the technology needed to push something to relativistic velocity, to get meaningful time travel requires pushing it into a range that we can only currently envision in atom smashers. Even antimatter is far below the energies needed. Lets take a perfect antimatter-powered stardrive and take a hop to the stars. Specifically, Alpha Centauri, out and back with no time at the destination. We aren't going all that fast, Lorentz factor of 1. That will give 8.6 years Earth time and 4.3 in ship time--and at launch our craft is 15/16ths fuel. Lorentz factor 2. 8.6 years Earth time, 2.15 years ship time, 255/256ths fuel. Lorentz factor 3. 1.07 years ship time, 4095/4096ths fuel. See how prohibitive it gets without pushing you that far into the future? 

Larry Niven did a pretty good job of addressing this but I can't recall what book it appeared in. Teleportation has costs, both in money and time. The lower these costs the more teleportation will take over other forms of transport. Note that in his Known Space books teleportation always obeys the laws of physics. The teleportation system must make up the energy differential, there are limits to how much it can do so. It's also a lightspeed effect and thus not used for interstellar transit (the hyperdrive is known long before teleportation.) The limit to how far he pushed it is the Puppeteer homeworld. Teleportation is open-air and too cheap to meter. The result is that for passenger transport there is nothing else. Everyone "walks" everywhere, following lines of teleport discs three steps apart. Step on the next disc and you hop, when you're at your destination you sidestep and don't hop. Different paths go at different "speeds" (distance between discs.) IIRC there were also ways to command the discs to take you where you wanted to go. 

Short, fat trees that grow in a checkerboard pattern and do not burn well. A walker can sidestep through them, a tank would have a major problem getting through them. Sure, you can blast but that would become very inefficient to go any distance that way. As for how trees can do that, think of things like Aspens--that spread via roots. 

The aliens are using a stardrive unknown to the races in your area. It permits travel over very great distances but can only be used when there is a suitable stellar configuration. (Perhaps a pair of neutron stars in exactly the right orbit to warp space appropriately to use the drive.) The aliens only show up when such a configuration exists on both ends so they can get here and also get home. 

Look at today's high energy weapons systems to see how to do it. Specifically, the bazooka/RPG/LAW type weapon. The launch motor produces too much energy for the user to handle so the energy is vented out the back of the launcher instead. Most of them do it with a blast of fire out the back but there is a version where inert material is expelled instead so it can be fired indoors without endangering the operator. (Not that you can actually use such a weapon indoors--the warhead would endanger the operator. The intent is to allow it to be fired out a window.) Your railgun will need to work on a similar basis. When the projectile goes forward a heavier mass is ejected slower. (Probably in the form of sand or dust so it doesn't go punching holes in whatever's behind.) Addressing the comments: Yes, it means a big don't-stand-here zone, although it could be used indoors, like the RPGs that expel an inert reaction mass rather than flame. The reaction mass must be expelled, otherwise it simply turns a sharp kick into a more prolonged shove--still too much for the operator to withstand. I do agree you have substantially increased your ammunition weight but a too-heavy round is better than a round that can't be fired at all without killing the operator. Note that you could somewhat reduce the logistics problem by making the weight water--and allow field-loading of the water. 

A laser spectroscope--the sort of thing we mounted on Curiosity. Since you'll be using it on humans you will want to modify it a bit--all the energy should be delivered in one very quick pulse. You want to vaporize a tiny bit of the target while doing minimum harm to the surround. (Keep it small enough and you'll just be vaporizing dead skin, no harm done.) It's actually less harmful than the cutting technique but the equipment is bulkier. 

Minimal damage, minimal risk: Evacuate a substantial area around it. Punch a small hole in the building. (There might even be a suitable window.) Pump in all the liquid nitrogen you can get your hands on. The electronics go far below their minimum operating temperature and shut down. Now you send in the sysadmins in suitable protective gear to turn everything off before it warms back up. 

You dismissed the Ringworld as requiring unobtainium but that's not completely true. Niven's design for a Ringworld certainly requires it (not only for the scrith, but the walls themselves.) However, you can build one without it, although it will be much more massive--you'll need several solar systems worth of planets as raw material. The basic problem is the Ringworld is moving far above orbital velocity and thus wants to depart into intergalactic space. To keep it in place he relies in a unobtainium band (I'd hate to think of the stretching force on that band!) but there's another approach: Don't have it moving above orbital velocity in the first place. Wait a moment, though--doesn't that mean everyone falls off? No--because what matters is the average velocity of the ring. You can have part moving fast, part moving slow--a living surface moving at the 770km/sec of the Ringworld and a much heavier mass behind it that is moving at 0km/sec. Since the Earth is moving about 30km/sec this means the backing mass is roughly 25x the ring mass. No point experiences a force greater than it would sitting on the surface of the Earth. Obviously the ring must never touch the backing, you'll need a massive maglev setup. (And the Ringworld would have gone kablooie when the superconductor-eater got into that!) Note that I said the walls also required unobtaininum--but we don't actually need walls. Instead of a surface extending vertically we simply put a small bend in the floor of the Ringworld and the backing mass. We can make the angle sufficiently small as to not cause issues, once the bent area extends high enough we have our atmosphere holder. Now, the stability problem remains. We have no way of keeping the Ringworld in orbit with current tech. 

user14837 almost got it. Food and water are not limiting factors. Energy is the problem, though. Hydrogen can transport energy, it's not an energy source, though. For that you'll need either fission or fusion if we can make it work. Those produce a lot of waste heat. All that heat will require even more power to run the air conditioners to keep civilization inhabitable. Eventually you reach the point the oceans boil--and then Earth goes the way of Venus. Surviving that with near-future tech is quite problematic. Addressing Gary's comment about power: A quick look shows lots of cities in the 60,000/mi^2 density. There are 57 million square miles of land. That's 3 trillion people. They're all industrialized so lets use US data instead of the world data. The world energy is 6x the US energy. We need to multiply by another x3 because of this. We are now up to 1,500x current levels. Your numbers give about .01 degrees for current use--x1,500 is 15 degrees. I'm not finding good data on the energy use of the indoor farming that will be needed but it's considerable. It's going to be well past those 15 degrees. 

Phone, per se, no. It will take the network date as accurate and figure it's wrong. If you're running any time-limited trial versions they might not like it, otherwise all you risk is wrong-way-sync errors, yesterday's data overwriting today's. However, you have a paradox problem. You have two identical SIMs on the network and they will conflict. You at Jump-23 will be conflicting with you at Jump+1. The call you received at Jump-23 might end up going to Jump+1 instead--and you just changed your own past. It's conceivable that the network might call shenanigans on the duplicated SIM, also, and shut down your account. An even bigger paradox problem if it happens. 

If you'll accept simply taking them out of orbit, not necessarily re-entry: Two degenerate masses fly by the Earth, close enough to cause nasty tides but far enough out that Earth stays well clear of their Roche limit. The approach speed is low so they spend a fair amount of time near Earth. Normally this would cause some nasty orbital effects but the two masses counterbalance almost perfectly (a perfect match is impossible as it means they would impact each other post-encounter.) If the masses are heavy enough I don't think anything could remain in orbit but whether it re-entered or was ejected is another matter. 

No. Things would be fine for a while but their 8 million population simply isn't enough to maintain a high tech civilization and in time things will run down. The problem is one of specialization. There are a lot of things that society does that are represented by far less than 1 per 8 million people. Those things will pretty much cease to exist. The Swiss will survive but not at a 21st century tech level. 

We already have correct answers as to the impossibility of this and how much food there actually is. However, there is another point that limits things still further: Your lone man is not able to reach all the food that's out there. Few people can safely cross the ocean single-handed. Wildlife will reclaim parts of Central America, crossing there is going to be extremely difficult also. To a lesser degree there will be food in isolated outposts that he is going to have difficulty reaching. 

LSemi rejects an impact trigger but I think that is invalid. Yes, grabbing an asteroid and tossing it at Yellowstone isn't an answer because to punch deep enough it's too energetic, rendering the eruption moot. However, what if you don't throw an asteroid? Go out into the asteroid belt and start mining, the objective being to build a rod a few miles long but only tens of feet wide and throw that. Make sure it hits straight. 

The <10% fuel requirement means we need a high exhaust velocity. Far beyond what we can do with chemical rockets. The non-destructive nature is far more of a problem. You are liberating vast energies when you push a rocket into the sky, that energy is going to bounce off the ground and be quite destructive. What can we eject from our rocket that goes at very high velocity and doesn't tear up the ground? Neutrinos! Now, I have no idea how we are supposed to generate this flood of neutrinos or direct them in the right direction but you didn't ask for something known to work, but just something that doesn't obviously not work. Assuming you had an appropriate neutrino generator you would have a rocket that could take off from your lawn without killing the grass (except where it was squashed by the landing legs.) 

You've got a problem here: The radioactive materials that keep the planet's core hot will be virtually gone by the time your planet warms. With no molten core you will have no plate tectonics and thus there will be no vulcanism or uplift. The result is your planet erodes. By the time you're trying to make it habitable you'll have a world of constant depth oceans. 

1) Subvert the judicial system--you don't need the whole thing, just the people at the top. The objective is to keep the misdeeds of your people from being prosecuted. 2) Impeach or prosecute those who stand in your way. The farther you go down this road the less careful you have to be to maintain appearances. 

1) Nuclear land mines. Yes, it's spies will tell them where they are but it has no weapons that can dig them out unless it's just about on top of them--but at that point an observer pushes the button. Knowing where they are they don't pose an actual threat but they can contain it if you emplace a ring of them around it. 2) Now that you have it pinned you call in NASA. Grab a whole bunch of nukes and head for the asteroid belt. You want a very solid asteroid (stony iron or something more metallic if you can find it) probably something around half a mile across although just how big depends on exactly how tough the snake is. Build a base dug into one side of the asteroid, gently lob nukes around to the far side and push the button. Do it right and you can get something like 10% of the bomb's energy into motion--your asteroid will move. Take the asteroid well inside Earth's orbit, approach from as close to the sun as you can. Line up on the snake, the crew will bail at at the point where their rocket can push them 4000 miles before the impact. The snake's spies don't operate in space, such a rock is basically undetectable by modern technology and you didn't specify any super telescopes--the snake won't see the rock until it touches the atmosphere and there won't be anything it can do about it at that point. It's defenses are formidable but they can't stop the huge energy of the rock. The rock I'm using isn't big enough to actually smash the whole snake because a rock of that size would be pretty bad for humanity (It would rival the dinosaur killer.) However, it will cut the snake in two and the parts will be devastated--the snake can be finished off with nukes.
