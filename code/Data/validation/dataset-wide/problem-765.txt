Because scientists are now certain that dark matter exists but the exact nature of it is still being investigated. Its extremely important to understand dark matter if we hope to further our knowledge of the universe. Dark matter makes up such a significant part of the total mass of the universe that it must be accounted for in simulations and models of galaxies and other large scale structures in space. Money spent on dark matter research is certainly NOT wasted. 

Earth didn't get here before GW's. GW's have been around since the early universe. We have just recently developed the technology to detect the large gravitational waves associated with very massive disruptions in the fabric of space-time. We also know that our sun is not a 1st generation star, so much of the matter used to create our sun and planets came from a much earlier super-nova explosion. 

The file you had linked as 'Detailed NEO Data' lists all the orbital parameters needed to determine the position of the object as a function of time. It lists these parameters for the objects orbiting the earth. This should be just what you need. They are located at bottom of file. There are routines to convert the orbit in orbital parameters to cartesian coordinates. This may be easier to use. You can google on orbital parameters conversion to find these routines. I think I have a copy in Fortran but not many people use Fortran now. 

The little ring around Pluto in the center describes its path. The barycenter of this binary system is on the opposite side of the ring, starting from Pluto. 

They certainly can. A ring is often formed around a celestial body when its gravity rips apart another smaller celestial body. The Sun is really massive, so it could destroy any object that is not dense enough. Just Google about the Roche Limit for more informations (and better explanations). Now, take a look at our solar system : You have the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, and you also have the Kuiper belt beyond Neptune. Would you consider these being rings ? They sure are not as smooth as Saturn's, but to my mind, they still are rings. 

I read somewhere that counting from today, five planets will be aligned during almost two weeks IIRC. The planets are : Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Mercury and... us. I know Jupiter and Mars can be seen with the naked eye, but I would really like to catch a glimpse of Saturn. Assuming one does not own a telescope, but small binoculars, how can one maximize his chances of seeing at least Mars, Jupiter and Saturn ? 

Amazon has solar film sheets if that's what you're looking for. It is sold by Amazon for Thousand Oaks Optical. Amazon sometimes has next day or 2 days delivery. 

The gravitational is radial only. That means if you tried a different shape then you would have regions, like hills, where a change in the angle would experience a much less attraction towards the center. This region would, over time, be attracted to a different angle with a greater force of attraction. Or spherical. This results in a spherical-like shape. 

It would look as shown below. And yes it would resemble a globular cluster except the stars move differently. Elliptical galaxies have an approximately ellipsoidal shape. Globular clusters are often associated with galaxies. The Milkey Way contains over 150 identified globular clusters. Shown below are globular clusters. 

No it wouldn't make a difference unless you moved it near another star or body. If it was moved such that something was close enough to exert significant gravitational attraction it would have an effect on our solar system. 

You have to remember that the alignment for an eclipse is a very rare situation. It's not as simple as the occurrence of a new moon. The planet and the moon have to align just so in relation to the sun for an eclipse to occur. Sorry, no numbers here but just trying to emphasize that several factors have to occur between 2 fast moving bodies. 

Sunrise is the moment when the point you are located on, on Earth, gets to receive its part of the sunlight (due to the Earth's rotation you spoke about). And sunset is the moment when the point you are located on, on Earth, has made its turn and faces away from the Sun, then preventing you from receiving its light. When the Earth will have made another half of its rotation, you will get to see another sunrise. The Earth makes a full rotation in a 24h cycle. This is why you get a sunrise and a sunset everyday :) 

As StephenG stated, this is not the reason why Pluto is no longer a planet. The center of rotation of the two bodies is called the barycenter. It can be calculated with accuracy, knowing the mass of the two bodies and the distance separating them. See : 

The word orbit could refer to three latin words : orbis, which means "ring", orbitus, which describes et circular shape, and orbita, which describes the track of a wheel. As you can see, the meanings of this word are quite old. It is therefore hard to tell the first time it was used to describe a celestial body's round trajectory. But the word itself comes from latin.
