I can think of two reasons. First, because the backboard is a vertical surface, it is easier to see and aim for with your shot. It is easier to pick a target on the board, aim for it, and hit it than it is to arc the ball and get it to land in the middle of the horizontal rim. Second, when the ball hits the backboard, the backboard absorbs some of the kinetic energy of the ball, slowing it down. When this happens, the ball can fall into the basket and is less likely to bounce out after hitting the rim. 

Normally, the back foot at the point of the catch is the starting location for the return measurement. If the ball is caught in the end zone, the goal line is the starting point for the measurement. As a result, 100 yards is the maximum length of a kick return in college. The NFL treats this statistic slightly differently, described in the NFL Guide for Statisticians (PDF). First, they specify that the return does not start until the "impetus of the kickoff ends and he is able to initiate forward progress." Second, they do not have the exception for balls caught in the endzone, so it is possible to have kick returns longer than 100 yards. (Thanks, New-To-IT, for reminding me of this in the comments.) From the 2016 NFL book: 

This is done to ensure that there is not a push when the game is over. A push is when no one wins, and the sportsbook gives everyone their wager back. Here is an example: For this week's Pittsburgh at Baltimore game, one sportsbook lists the point spread as 3, with Pittsburgh favored to win. Let's say you decide to bet on Pittsburgh. If Pittsburgh wins by 4 points, you win. If Pittsburgh wins by 2 points, you lose. If Pittsburgh wins by 3, you get your money back, along with everyone who bet on Baltimore. Another sportsbook lists the point spread as 2.5. If you bet on Pittsburgh, and they win by 3, you win, and if they win by 2, you lose. There is no possibility of a push in this case.

Under World Pool-Billiard Association rules, a shot ends when the balls stop moving. Therefore, the foul would be on the next shot. This type of foul is called a Touched Ball, and in 8-Ball, it results in the play passing to the opponent with the cue ball in hand. Therefore, in this situation, I believe that the table would not be considered open anymore, and the player who made the break shot would get the cue ball in hand. 

Motorsports are not currently part of the Olympics, although there is no rule banning them. In fact, in the 1900 Olympics in Paris, automobile, motorcycle, and motorboat racing were demonstration events, and in the 1908 Games in London, there were three motorboat racing events as an official part of the games. However, there haven't been any motorsports in the games since then. IOC president Jacques Rogge, speaking specifically about Formula One, said in 2012, 

The PDGA Technical Standards, Rev. 5/14/2014 contains this language on the material permissible for discs manufactured for PDGA competition: 

MLB has clear rules for this circumstance. If the interference by a ball boy is intentional, the ball is declared dead, and the umpire can do whatever thinks he needs to do to nullify the interference. If it is unintentional, the ball is still alive and in-play. The comments in the official rules also explain what is meant by intentional vs. unintentional actions. It doesn't matter whether the ball boy was actually trying to interfere, it is whether he was acting intentionally in what he was doing. So if he is in the wrong spot at the wrong time and gets hit by the ball or the player, that is unintentional. In the case of the example photo you posted, he is trying to catch the ball, and that would be considered intentional. In that game, it actually turned out that the ball boy missed the ball, the player did not collide with the ball boy, and the umpire did not call interference. From the MLB Official Baseball Rules, 2013 Edition, Rule 3.15: 

A third-down conversion attempt occurs when a team runs a third-down play and either succeeds in getting the first down (or a touchdown), or fails and goes to fourth down. The clock doesn't stop a play; if the clock runs to 0, the half ends when the play is over. So if the clock runs out before the third-down play begins, then no third-down attempt has occurred. If the clock runs to 0 while the third-down play is taking place, then it will count as an attempt, and it will be a successful attempt if it ends in a first down or a touchdown, and a failure if it does not. One other thing to note about third-down efficiency statistics: If the first down is achieved as a result of a penalty, then it does not count as an attempt for statistics purposes. The rules for determining third-down efficiency are defined in the NCAA Football Statisticians' Manual. From the 2013 Basic Interpretations section: 

The concept of the Hall of Fame has its roots in ancient Norse mythology. Valhalla was an enormous hall in Asgard where warriors who were slain in battle would go upon their death. King Ludwig I of Bavaria was apparently inspired by this legend, and built two different halls inspired by the Norse legend: Walhalla near Regensburg, Bavaria (completed in 1842), and the Ruhmeshalle in Munich (completed in 1853), whose name literally means "Hall of Fame." These halls were museums containing plaques and statues of important German-speaking people, including scientists, artists, and politicians. In 1900, the Hall of Fame for Great Americans was completed. Inspired by the Ruhmeshalle, Dr. Henry MacCracken, chancellor of New York University, conceived the idea for this hall, built in the Bronx. The hall includes Americans in a variety of categories, including authors, businessmen, inventors, clergy, scientists, artists, soldiers, and teachers, but not athletes. The name of this building is the first time that the English phrase "Hall of Fame" was used. Unlike the halls in Germany, where the people enshrined were determined by Ludwig I, MacCracken established a nationwide body of electors made up of prominent Americans. This group held regular elections to vote on new nominees for entry into the hall. From there, it wasn't that big of a leap to come up with the idea of a "hall of fame" dedicated to a particular sport. The National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York, founded in 1939, might be the first professional sports hall of fame. Sports halls of fame generally follow the model of the first hall in having entry decided by a board of electors. 

In the Biathlon Men's Sprint at Sochi, racers ski three times around a 3.3-kilometer loop, for a total of 10-kilometers. After the first and second loops, they stop to shoot five targets. For each target the racer misses, he needs to ski around a 150-meter penalty loop immediately after the target stop before he continues on to the next race loop. The Women's Sprint is the same, except their race loop is 2.5-kilometers, for a total of 7.5-kilometers.
