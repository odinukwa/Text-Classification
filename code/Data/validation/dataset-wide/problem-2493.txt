I'd say you are expecting something to happen. Chasing something outside, when really you need to stay calm and let things happen on the inside. Whether anything happens or not, you must meditate for however much time you can. It seems like you are doing it, but you are weighing yourself down by burden of expectations and reading or listening to too much anicca or whatever. I am doing this too much reading around thing. So I am talking out of what I experienced. I don't care about what the Buddha experienced. Honestly. You have to drop it. The mind is caught up with all that, plus worldly affairs and loses balance. And you feel bogged down. Stop pushing at it. I'll say it again, Drop your expectations. And simply meditate. 

First thing, , not sure if Gautama Buddha said this. Anyway assuming that he did, what he means is, one day you are going to die, and at that moment you should not be surprised. This can also be rephrased as, It is not about spirituality versus something else. It is a general life thing. Nowadays people are distracted with 200 things on their minds because they got too involved in thinking/creating ideas rather than doing/implementing. People are taking their life for granted so much that when it is over, they have lost the time to live life rather than think about life. That seems to be what you are busy with right now. Your mind is playing with you. And you are playing along unconsciously. If you were conscious, then you would know it and start living life rather than unnecessarily thinking. Secondly, Gautama Buddha's goal is enlightenment and the end of suffering. This is single mindedly looking inward to find out what is the nature of suffering and how to end it. If he accomplishes that, that is success. What is your goal? You need to define that for yourself. Ultimately, know that you will die one day and thus live life consciously. And of course thinking/mind is required for planning and executing an activity. It is not of much use otherwise. 

Is a logical questioning process of every thought(almost) a useful way to break through thought itself and possibly understand enlightenment? For eg:- What is this thought? What is the mind? And try to inspect it clearly. If no answer appears, (because you see they are difficult, almost impossible questions) that is still ok, but you begin to question things with a scientific temper and rationality. 

You're clinging to your theory. Clinging causes fear of letting it go. And hence your predicament. Let it be. 

Let’s get this straight. This is the problem when your mind is active and you’re reading all this stuff and thinking about it. The mind can only be confused. Because “moving above your intellect” is enlightenment, nirvana and all that jazz. Right now you seem stuck with your intellect, which can only dissect stuff and make you operational in this world which is a level lower. You have to play a role in this society with some element of identity. Otherwise I can’t be talking to you right now. If you keep telling yourself “there is no self, there is no self”, that is a wrong view, because you have a viewpoint. There is a bias in your mind telling you that what you read somewhere is correct. You cannot “think up” no-self. It is a direct experience. Not a thought. You’ll only end up dissociating and creating personality disorders for yourself. Just going crazy. Your mind will split itself up into a guy who is the ego and a no-self perspective. You see this mechanism of the mind? It is not true in your experience. I cannot stress this point enough. Right now your mind is sitting there going, “oh I am not-self, then what else is there...” Let’s clarify this chicken and egg story. You are thinking right now because you’re alive, not the other way round. If I take your breath away all your mental nonsense will cease. What do you then know about this life actually? Nobody knows anything. They just “think things up”. If you try to think it up, then all kinds of contortions and twists will start to brew inside your head. And it will only lead to mental disorders. When the Buddha (and so many other Buddhas) talk about no-self, they come from a direct experience of unity with everything. That is the source of “no self”. Their perspective is abolished. There is only truth for them. Unlike our experience where we are this body and mind and everything else is separate. And we have opinions about everything from our perspective. So how to live life, you ask? Respond to everything, you are very much there, there is no “no-self” or “all self” or whatever your mind is brewing. If you really experienced no-self you wouldn’t be here asking this question :) 

I ask this with a healthy skepticism. What is meditation? Is it the style that is put forth in the texts or traditions, like Tibetan or Indian or whatever tradition? For example, sit down and dedicate time to meditate. And is the definition of meditation objective or is it a subjective experience/practice? For example, Marcus Aurelius' writing, Meditations. Can following a train of thought intentionally, not compulsively, be considered meditation? I wish to question why we sit down to meditate for sometime. I have been giving answers on this site, giving so-called "practical advice" about sitting and meditating and then it struck me that I may be dulling the mind through this. Meditation seems to lend you to a certain calmness, which is good, but if I may say, a certain suggestibility. I accept that the mind's activity is fairly ceaseless. Is this an altering of the state of mind in a sort of long term negative way? What I mean is, it seems to me that sometimes I can't seem to distinguish between "dulling of the mind" and "calmness" through meditation. 

Why? What happened? Why can't you laugh in a situation meditatively? I myself was like this. Not talking. Being silent. Not involved in/Aloof from the situation. I think you are misunderstanding the meditative nature a little bit. When you are playing a game, why won't you be joyful or laugh? Or be disappointed if you lose. And still feel that everything is okay. See, Lord Buddha said, as quoted, . Which means he would laugh when the situation is so, shed tears when the situation is so, advise people when situation is so. It seems like you are getting stuck and taking life too seriously. See you can be serious when required and joyful when required. What is the problem? 

When Gautama left his palace to become an ascetic, it is said that he found some Gurus he learnt from, and left further dissatisfied. Is there any mention of that period of the Buddha's life in the texts? Or did Buddha speak about these experiences? I got this link : $URL$ 

About the truth of the story, nobody can know. But one thing is for sure. The answers given by the Buddha are contextual. By simply asking "Does God exist?", I don't feel like giving you a serious answer to be honest. This is what I meant by "trolling". I think there are many spin-off questions that the questioner has to observe for themselves. Possibly by starting off with defining God and suchlike questions. Now that's another matter altogether. 

When I am not judging any moments of life and taking it all in, should I give importance to feeling anything at all? I tend to get very rational and "accepting" about things. A feeling of letting go arises, which makes me feel very passive? It feels like there is no time for a feeling because we are losing the next moments by living inside a feeling, either positive/negative. Also am I doing this right? Sometimes, it is like I am shutting that emotion up because I don't want to give in to a feeling. Why would I not want to give in to a feeling that makes sense at that point of time? That is mere repression. Any thoughts on this? 

If today you feel happy/grateful because somebody's kids are mad and you are better, then if tomorrow I come and fight you or take away your belongings, you will be a very sad/depressed person. If 2 retarded kids decide your emotions or if I decide your emotions, then this is a very bad thing for you, because in any situation in life, you will feel all kinds of emotions. Your mood will be a slave to the world outside because anything can happen. Whatever you feel as emotions is internal (inside you), be it happiness, sadness, anger etc., These are not external, please see this. How do you want your emotions to be? Sweet all the time? Pleasant all the time? If your own emotions are controlled by you yourself, the owner, then there will be no need to think about some retarded kids to feel better/grateful. 

There is another reason other than "competition" from other religions. If you've observed people, they really like conclusions. They hate stuff when it is open-ended and exploratory and just don't have the patience for it. When they do meditation, they want to sit tight, and still get consumed by the mind. The mind wants to conclude upon something, otherwise it is always confused and you will never know calmness/peace. It will keep cropping up stuff you don't want to hear. It is a bad master. So most of the time they just go the traditional way and install an idol. And be done with it to hell. Pray to something and feel good. 

Just my 2 cents. If you think that you once had a goal and now you have changed, you're just shifting goals probably for good karma. But either way you are being selfish. You cannot escape that. You are being selfish saying that now I wish to do this instead of that because this gives me larger satisfaction. Notice the aversion you are having when commenting on those scientists or philosophers. They are just having thoughts like you do. The point I am trying to make is, either way you're just thinking. You're just having opinions. Opinions are subject to change. The idea is to bring the mental vacillations down to a minimum. Could you try to simply be involved in an activity, in this case, your studies? Without judging? You are now thinking of doing something else because your mind says whatever you are doing is nonsense. Next thing your mind will say this is nonsense too, try something else. In this way, you're just being dragged willy nilly by your mind. It's all a vacillation. I would suggest you just be aware of it and simply involve yourself in an activity. And let it pass. If you look at one of my previous questions, I said I keep having this feeling of being enlightened. Now that's what I call a vacillation. I am just deluded into thinking something by the mind. Like I am this greater self, and I am better than all of you. That's the huge ego my friend. Ego can expand itself. I bet you're having the same idea too going deeper and deeper into your "meditation" as you say. Like you are this larger than life thingy. And you and your thinking is better than all the nonsense those scientists and philosophers of western thought spew. See what I mean?
