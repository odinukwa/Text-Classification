There's cheap and there's too cheap! Remember - this is a tool you may be trusting with your life... For any kind of serious navigation you need a baseplate compass rather than the button type in your image. This is so you can take reliable bearings from your map to the land and back-bearings from the land to your map. Even the entry-level baseplate models of a decent brand like Silva or Suunto will be fine for most recreational purposes, and start at around $20. An own-brand baseplate compass from a trustworthy outdoor chain should be a little cheaper still. Compasses last for decades with proper care, so are a good investment. You can spend 3-4 times more on the top models, and for this you get faster needle orientation, better damping, better handling of magnetic variation, and a compass that will work in both the northern and southern hemispheres (the base models will be balanced for the hemisphere where it is purchased). All these features are convenient, but in practice a top-end model won't be significantly more accurate than an inexpensive model used with care. So the answer is, you can expect a cheap baseplate compass from any reputable brand to be 100% reliable provided you understand its limitations and use it with care. Please don't trust your life to other types of compass that aren't designed for serious wild-country navigation. 

Be aware of the things you are most likely to forget in each scenario, and develop a routine to run through a physical or mental checklist every time you depart If you are still liable to forget things, tie them to yourself or to your pack! 

Well, this article in National Geographic provides a clue - a number of key areas on the face have become unstable, and a large rockfall has destroyed a section of the Normal Northwest Face. Doesn't sound like fun. Here's some of the rubble at the base of the cliff: 

The boot in the illustration has what is known as a fully sprung sole. As you can see, there is an upward curve at the toe which reportedly adds a slight spring to the step and eases walking uphill. Here's a party in the Lake District in 1873, wearing very similar boots: 

This is from the well known trekker Andrew Skurka, who did an East/West traverse that would cross similar terrain to your proposed route. Question: 

So how much storm-worthiness do you really need? Because if you want something genuinely bombproof you're going to have to pay in terms of weight or liveability. How much wind-worthiness do you really need? If you camp in sheltered spots below the treeline you probably don't need to worry too much about wind. Most of the higher-end manufacturers will ensure that a 3 season tent can survive up to 30 mph (Force 6: Strong Breeze). So focus on weight and liveability. If you camp above the treeline in exposed spots it's another game entirely - you want something that can survive upwards of 50 mph in case you get caught out, and most shelters simply won't deliver. How to choose a tent for exposed camping? There are two issues here - design and construction quality. For design, there are two broad categories - peg-supported and self-supported. Peg supported designs include the Pyramid, A-Frame, Single Hoop and Tunnel. They can all work well, but rely entirely on finding enough good peg placements. Pitching can be finicky as you have to achieve a good stretch on the panels, and the pegs have to do double duty holding up the tent structure and bracing against the wind. Many designs have a big footprint, and if a peg pops in a storm you have a problem. Walking poles are stronger than any lightweight tent pole, so if you carry them you could save weight with a shelter designed to use walking poles for support. There's quite a choice these days, from mainstream brands such as MSR and Black Diamond to cottage manufacturers like TarpTent, TrekkerTent, MLD, Six Moons and Yama. For difficult pitches on sandy or rocky soil "freestanding" designs using flexible poles can be more robust. (They're not really freestanding - they still require a few pegs, but that's how the marketing departments describe them). The poles hold up the tent and stretch most of the panels, leaving the pegs with the single duty of bracing against wind. But poles are heavy so these benefits come at a cost. A true geometric is impractical in a solo lightweight tent, so you are restricted to a two-pole crossover design or to something using connection clips like the Big Agnes range. Personally I'm wary of the clip designs in a serious bad-weather tent as they look vulnerable to failure. Makers like Hilleberg who design for serious bad weather don't use them. But with the classic crossover, design restraints mean that you are either looking at something quite heavy like the Hilleberg Suolo at 2.2 kilos, or something tiny like the TrekkerTent Bivy at 1 kilo. The second issue is build-quality. I've always thought of the single-hoop design as quite limited, but here's a video of a Hilleberg Akto doing fine in a measured 85mph (Hurricane Force 12) wind! Quite a testament to good materials and construction. So if you're looking for serious storm-worthiness, focus on companies like Hilleberg, Trekkertent, Tarptent (their Scarp 1 and StratoSpire 1 in particular are good in wind) and Mountain Laurel who have a reputation for bombproof build quality. Some manufacturers cut corners with flimsy materials and poles to achieve lightness at the cost of durability. So to sum up... As you can see, it's all about making the right tradeoffs for the conditions. For sheltered camping you can prioritise weight and livability. Don't push your luck with the weather and pick your campsites with care. For above the treeline, you have to trade off the costs and benefits of freestanding and peg-supported designs. And you should focus on manufacturers with a proven reputation for building storm-worthy shelters. As for the Big Agnes designs, I personally wouldn't fancy taking them anywhere exposed - too complex and failure-prone for my tastes. And they pitch inner-first, which can be a nightmare in heavy rain... 

Foot health and blister prevention is a large subject - you can literally write a book about it. My understanding was greatly increased by John Vonhof's Fixing Your Feet, which is regarded as the classic in the field. John is a faspacker and ultramarathoner who developed his skills treating thousands of endurance athletes during ultra events. He swaps ideas with many others in the field and regularly updates the book as experience develops. John does not recommend generic white sports tape - it's designed to stick to itself and does not adhere all that well to skin. Duct tape is cheap and workable, but for most applications there's a better alternative. If you're after the best solution and can bear a little extra expense he strongly recommends kinesiology tapes. 

So of you're looking for something lightweight, storm-worthy and relatively liveable the A-Frame still has a lot to offer if you walk with poles. Personally I'm working on a Make-Your-Own-Gear design incorporating the best ideas from the '80s but using modern materials. I reckon I can bring in something almost as strong as the Phortress for around 800 grams all-in. 

There's nothing else in your area of the right size and shape. So it does sound as though the osprey is your best bet. For more confidence, you could contact local bird watchers or conservationists/rangers. In my experience, they know pretty much everything that moves on their patch... 

Iron-on Be very careful of iron-on - nylon melts! You have to get the temperature right. I wouldn't be confident that the patch would hold as the rucksack flexes, though I guess that depends on the quality of the adhesive you use. Sewing Sewing will puncture the fabric and allow a little moisture through. You could mitigate this by applying silicone seam sealant to your stitch-holes on the inside of the pack. Not a bad solution, and less prone to disaster than iron-on. Bonding If the patch is made of nylon, you could bond it on for a reliable solution.
