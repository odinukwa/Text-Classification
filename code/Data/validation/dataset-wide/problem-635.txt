I'm not sure why you wouldn't just take the wheel off? The only case I've heard of people doing this is when they want to slam their rear wheel as far forward as possible. So far that the only way they can get the rear wheel off is to break the chain. oh....re-read your question...didn't see that you're taking the chain completely off the frame. As long as you get some slack by loosening the rear wheel it should be no problem to pop the chain off/on with the wheel still on there. However, it'll probably be easier (more slack) if you take the wheel off. 

Freecoaster: Advantage is coasting backwards. Disadvantage is higher weight and price. Cassette/freewheel: Advantage is lower weight and price. Disadvantage is no coasting backwards. 

Flatland frames generally have shorter top tubes, steeper head tube angles, shorter rear ends, etc... The down tube in your picture is designed to give you more room for front wheel scuffing. I'm noticing more and more flatland frames are designed to look like a typical street/park frame, but the geometry is not the same. I believe there are hybrid frames in use by Mathias Dandois, arguably the most progressive flatland/street rider. If you want to keep more options open maybe get what is categorized as a "Tech Street" frame, which would be something like the FIT Benny-L, or really any frame with a rear end <= 13.25 inches and a head tube angle >= 75 degrees. 

Yes, this is very much possible and extremely worthwhile. Just use common sense and don't practice on a busy curb. Practice/repetition builds confidence, which will reduce your fear of a crash. 

Besides eyeballing it and comparing the line to the seat tube, are there any tricks to getting 48 splined crank arms perfectly aligned? I must have spent a solid 15 minutes looking at them from every angle until I was satisfied. 

There is no rule or best, it's just whatever feels natural. Similar to which foot you put forward on a (skate,snow,surf)board. I'm always left foot forward on bmx, but that was mainly because I didn't want to wreck my right hand drive sprocket when I was first learning how to do grinds on my left side. If I try to do anything right foot forward it feels super awkward. Some people can ride both ways but they are freaks of nature. 

From my experiences with going backwards(fakie) on BMX, the best way to learn is to find a small bank or quarter pipe, ride up it, and come back down backwards. This will give you that initial speed so you don't fall over right away. I imagine it'd be kind of similar on a fixed gear, expect that you can actually gain more speed by pedaling backwards. I think the roll out would be similar. 

I'm not sure on the frame geometry of trial bikes but it looks like they have a very short "top/down" tube and the handle bars are nearly over the front axle. This gives you very poor handling at high speeds, hence the slow technical balancing riding that is done on them. Basically, they only have tire size in common...so which to choose depends on what you want to ride. 

Your best bet would be to add spacers under your stem, get a top-load stem, and/or get taller bars. Also, keep in mind that bmx bikes aren't really designed for comfortable seated pedaling. 

Never leave home without it. Great when riding all day. However, I would not recommend applying it to an already chaffed area. 

Helo Guys, I want to know your experience about carbon material and grease Can I use normal grease with carbon ? I want to put grease onto fork and stem.... Or WD-40 or silicone penetrant would be ok ? Thank you.... Can I use this one ? 

Usually I use the tool like this, put your degreaser inside it and of course the chain inside, rotate your crank and it will clean all part of your chain, inside out. 

What's the size of ball bearing on WH-R550 hub, is it 1/4" for the front one and rear one ? Can I replace them with 1/4" ceramic bearing ? Thanks 

I saw at ebay, 10 speed cassette compatible with shimano, it's very light 103 grams, but the material is alloy with ceramic coated, it says, the cassette can be used up to 3000K, is it true? or may be more than 3000K, because if it's 3000K the age for me is only about 3 months or less riding. Have any of you ever used one ? Thanks 

What's the cone spanner size for cone nut on Shimano WH-R550 Front wheel ? Is it 17mm or 18mm ? I tried with 16, it seems, need more, 1 or 2mm bigger. Thanks 

Should I use spacer on CS-7800 who is being installed on WH-7900 ? Or just install the cassete without 0.5mm spacer ? Cheers and thank you.. 

I have a question about hub, When should I grease my hub ? every 20000 km ? How do I know it needs new grease ? Because I can not see if the grease is dry or not...? Thanks 

Recently I read from some websites, it sells taiwanese carbon wheelset, How is the quality of the carbon rim, spokes and hub from those wheelset made in taiwan ? I didn't see any brand name, so it's blank name, Spesification : Size :700C full carbon wheels 20mm deep in clincher type : road bicycle wheelset material : 100% carbon fiber finish: 3k clear coating finish cassete body: shimano 8/9/10 speed or campagnolo 10/11 speed. Hub : Novatec hub A271SB/F372SB,sealed bearings,front 2,rear 4 (black/red/white colors are available) Nipple: aluminium (black/red/silver colors are available) Spoke : mac aero 494 spoke from cnspoke from taiwan(black) hole :Front 20H Rear 24H, special hole also can be ordered weight: 1430g +/- 30g each pair including Skewers and brake pads Thanks 

If you like to visit very steep climb, I suggest using 50/34 for chainring and 12/27 10 speed 12,13,14,15,16,17,19,21,24,27 for your sprocket, or 11-28 includes - 11,12,13,14,15,17,19,21,24,28 27 or 28 is very usefull if you climb more than 25% grade... But if you have a strong power output 53/39 chainring with 12-25 includes - 12,13,14,15,16,17,19,21,23,25 should be sufficient... I did 20% with 39/25....so every one is unique for this sprocket/chainring selection, depends on your leg :) 

Try put your seatpost / saddle on the vise ( reverse the bike ) then rotate the frame for pulling out the seatpost, put WD-40 or other lubricant for before you do it.... 

you can clean the chain without release it, use chain cleaner for it, you can rotate your crank and clean the chain. You will damage the pin if you release it everytime you clean the chain... 

Do you know how to match a color on the frame ? I want to buy a paint from a tool shop but I'm not sure if it's match with the frame color. I'm going to use the paint for a touch up. Thanks for the info.
