Backup battery bank failure As you've noted, it would be difficult to get computer chips to fail - they simply don't contain anything all that explosive. About the best you can do is an electrical fire resulting in exploding capacitors, but they're more like popcorn than an all-out fireball boom. So, we'll have to focus on the surrounding infrastructure - the most likely candidate being batteries. Datacenters typically have large banks of backup batteries (Google, for example, has a battery in each of their racks) - classic examples look like this: 

A quantum computer making heavy use of gold This is to primarily make use of its excellent contact conductivity as well as its non-corroding properties. Gold is a great conductor and is also very durable so it's currently used where a reliable connection is vital to product performance. This is why the pins of e.g. a USB port are very literally gold. Consumer chips made using a lot more gold would be more reliable. The modern world economy deeply depends on computing so it might even create a mini economic boom thanks to better electronics for everyone. There would possibly be a huge crash in satellite prices considering the extensive use of gold, increasing the chances of space becoming commercialized and therefore boosting the economy too. However.. Rather than releasing it into the economy, maybe it could all be ejected into space. Get rid of it instead of creating too much of it - that way it can't boost those functional use cases. This route would have more of an impact (particularly in the short term where the rapid cost rise disrupts multiple industrial practices) but ultimately industry would just swap to some other metal instead. 

Also more recently the Margolus-Levitin theorem states a limit dependent on energy (relevant for quantum computation): 

Apart from the, already mention in comments, creation of fulgurite the lightning discharge also produces a very strong magnetic field that is believed to be the origin of lodestones (a naturally magnetized magnetite). Magnetite itself is typically found in beach sand (mostly likely transported trough erosion). 

Lightning also oxidizes nitrogen in the air making nitrates which may lead to conditions more favorable to plant growth. It's a possibility that given enough time this hypothetical desert would became less barren although I do not have an opinion about what kind of plant life (inc. fungi). As an unrelated note on Lightning (but perhaps useful for people who wish to further explore lightning related phenomena in world building) check this. 

The state of the art in detective fiction of the 19th century was the simple substitution cipher, as seen in Poe's The Gold-Bug (1843) and Doyle's The Adventure of the Dancing Men (1903). According to Wikipedia, the state of the art in real life at the time was the Vigenère cipher — le chiffre indéchiffrable — until it was in fact déchiffred circa mid-century. Another cipher that would be mechanically plausible for the 19th century, but anachronistic in its level of sophistication, would be the Solitaire (a.k.a. Pontifex) cipher devised by Bruce Schneier and Neal Stephenson for Stephenson's novel Cryptonomicon. It uses a deck of playing cards to produce a stream of pseudorandom values, which can then be used as a non-repeating "keystream" in the same way as the Vigenère cipher uses the letters of its key word over and over. The most effective way for your eccentric inventor to protect his enciphered message would be to make it hard for the attacker to tell what is the message and what isn't. For example, instead of encrypting "SECRETFORMULA" to "OOAUAIOIAUOUEAIUOIIIUAIEAA", he could encrypt it to "motor acquaint voilá hum you're radium soil lithium nailed array". This would be very time-consuming to encrypt, although I guess not too bad if you're good at free-associating words quickly. Your genius inventor might even be able to disguise the cipher as a plausible-sounding diary entry! In general, this is known as steganography, and state-of-the-art methods for the 19th century would have included acrostics and the Cardan grille. With either of those methods, especially the Cardan grille, the inventor could read and write essentially at full speed. 

like PVC would not have the necessary strength to resist either an inflation or an orbit maneuver for scales of that size. This means that if you pulled one part (or even several) of the plastic piece it would not move the entire piece. It would just rip apart. Assuming that this plastic piece was already somehow in place notice that 1 Bar is almost the pressure we have, on Earth, at sea level. This is quite a bit. For your structure to support itself without collapsing (it would be in free fall after all) it would need to orbit the moon at speeds far from Selenosynchronous orbit requirement (I doubt 8000 meters is enough). In any case this isolation "plastic" would rip apart with the forces produced by the speed difference between plastic surface and moon surface. I do not think you can get away with using such a conventional material, or such a simplistic (one piece?) structure, for such an unconventional use. Neither the implementation or maintenance would work. Off the top of my head I would say the deterioration would be immediate. I think pursuing this idea in similar molds to the ones you have stated would require other type of structure (or composition of structures). 

Having read The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect, my gloss of your question is, "Would a computer AI, having already achieved singularity, ever become aware that it was being simulated on physical hardware, and begin to explore the ramifications of that hardware?" If the answer is "yes", then it's just a matter of how confident we are in the existence of physical superpowers that haven't been discovered yet merely through lack of effort and time. Imagine the Manhattan Project, but taking place at 2.5 billion operations per second, 24 hours a day. How many operations does it take to discover the first loophole, the first zero-day attack on the fabric of reality? In Roger Williams' novella, this is exactly what happens: 

A lodestone can attract iron and - I speculate - could in time, given an extreme frequency of lightning strikes, lead to abnormal concentration of iron (perhaps darker patches on the floor surrounded by a sandy color?). This is not totally unheard as can be seen by the existence of desert varnish (although mind the origin). 

None of the above state anything about the nature of "intelligence" because this is concept without any conclusive and definitive explanation. We are unable to reproduce a brain by design. In any case studies in neuroscience seem to show that: 

There are speculated limits for computation, notably the Bekenstein bound for information storage and Bremermann's limit for maximum computational speed of a self contained system. The latter assumes:
