Powerlifting or Aesthetism (speaking about all exercizes) ? Dumbells or bar (only speaking about pectorals exercizes) ? Since 1st september, 2018, I was used to do 5 powerlifting series (each one during only 20 sec) followed by 2 aesthetism series (each one during approx. 1 minute or a bit more, I wasn't as precise as I am now and thus I didn't measure). At bench press only AND for PL series only, I used bar. I can't remember if weither or not these both types of series followed any of the above protocols. Since 1st March, 2018, I only do 2 aesthetism series (each following PROTOCOL #2). I only use dumbells. My pre-training (warming-up) consists in increasing the weights until I reach the first serie's weighs. 4 series of warming are dedicated to that and it's called "potentiation" ; I never reach nervous/muscle fatigue during these series. I always used potentation. My pectorals exercizes 

Timing your protein is a theory that I've read has been debunked many times over. You'll still hear this being said from even the most seasoned lifters stuck in their ways, but ultimately it doesn't matter. The most important factor is to ensure you're consuming the proper amount of protein. If you're really headstrong on protein timing, then I'd say the logic seems sound that if you're taking a slow absorbing protein and you want it to start absorbing after your workout, you should take it before/during the workout to compensate. 

The weight in which you are lifting does not perfectly correlate to the numbers on the stack. The weighted plates that you put the pin into are showing the weight of the stack up to where the pin is. If you see the stack increasing in 10 lb increments that means that each plate is 10 pounds. Due to the mechanics of the machine, you are not necessarily doing 10 more pounds of work. The best example of weights that actually show how much weight you're lifting would be with free weights. 

For any exercise AND for hypertrophy and/or nervous system, is there any benefit to make a pause at the maximum of the contraction ? Consider my training. 

Before I show you my photos taken from different angles, I want to explain how I train. Biological informations AND Diseases I'm a 22.5yo male, 1.70m (67 inches), I think I'm between [20 ; 25]% BF. I think I have a pelvic anteversion. From June, 2017 to April, 2018, I suffered from sevear chronic insomnias (<5 hours, quite often 2 sleep hours). Since April, 2018, these insomnias are mostly cured. I think I have a gymnecomastia (since a lot of years and I believe it's due to hormones). Training dates Before september 2018, I trained all muscles (excepted back in thickness and lumbars) only with small weights (<= 20kg 44lb) during several months spaced by pauses of several months... Well I don't think these weird periods are actually important to take account. I seriously began musculation 9 months ago (i.e. : since september, 2018). Food Since I was 19, I always payed attention in excluding sodas and sweet things. From september to 1st may, 2018, I think I didn't eat I haven't eaten enough proteins for example (only 2 eggs per day whereas I eat 4 now). After 1st may, 2018, a typical day is : 

If you're experiencing a decrease in strength when you're doing arm exercises, then the decrease in size can be due to the loss of muscle. You would need to take a note of how much protein you're consuming, a lack of which could result in the muscle not being able to recover completely before the next workout. This here recommends 1.2-2g protein per kg of weight for building muscle. Note: If you want to up the protein intake then do so gradually. On the other hand, If you're strength levels are not declining, then the loss of excess fat from arms could be a plausible cause of the reduction in size. In regards to your goal, there is no spot reduction, fat gets reduced all over the body contingent of course on your calories intake.spot-reduction-myth Hope this helps. 

This is pretty understandable since shoulders are a difficult muscle to contract and extend completely thus putting a limit on the hypertrophy. I've followed this and substantially increase the size and vascularity in my shoulders. Note: The deltoids are composed of three different fibres, also referred as heads. Anterior, lateral, and posterior 

For what most bodybuilders are after, you pretty much have to operate within a bulking/cutting cycle. In order to gain muscle mass effectively a bodybuilder (especially one who's been exercising for years) must eat in a surplus and work out efficiently. In doing this, they will also accumulate fat to some degree. This depends on how "clean" their bulk was. Then in order to lose this excess fat, they have to "cut" by eating fewer calories than they use. In doing this, they also lose a bit of muscle. If one were to follow the method you propose, they would indeed notice muscle/strength gains as well as likely gaining fat depending on their intake. For most casual gym goers and the general population, this would be a more than acceptable regime. However many people looking to get into working out research bodybuilding advice and therefore find themselves researching a bulking/cutting cycle. For most people, it's not needed. But for competition bodybuilders or those looking to make very large changes, it is the superior route to go. 

There are a few reasons you might not be seeing muscle gains and only fat gains. I'll start out with the first one that comes to mind, and the most probable from my perspective. You are. Take pictures, lots of them. If you're in a surplus and gaining muscle you are naturally going to gain fat too. This is going to look like you've gained mostly fat when in actuality you've gained fat and muscle. If you've got pictures you can compare yourself within them. When you lose the excess fat after your bulk, you'll regain muscle definition and you can see any gains made much easier. I'm also curious about how you're training. 5-6 times per week? Light weights? 1RM's? High Reps? Low Reps? How long are your sessions? Are you doing cardio? What type of training are you doing? These are all important factors in how you're training. If you're eating in a surplus and hitting your protein levels you will notice muscle gains providing you are working out adequately. Your body will develop more muscle if you are: A.) Giving your body a reason to build more (working out so your body adapts) B.) Giving your body the proper tools to build muscle (Protein, proper rest, etc.) 

My question How should I change my training to have better pectorals, considering my poor pectorals anatomy and all of these informations ? Pictures $URL$ 

Breakfast, 8:00 : Omelet with 2 eggs + unsweetened yogurt + 1 flour bread (50% white, 50% complete), with nuts, bread pine nuts, etc. + linseed and olive oils Collation, 10:30 : 20 grams of almonds Lunch : 80 grams of rice-quinoa, or 80 grams of lenses, or 80 grams of red and white beans AND carots or green beans or spinash or broccoli AND 25 grams of cheese AND 1 apple AND Sunflower+Rapeseed+Oleisol+Grape seed mixed oils Collation, 16:00 : 20 grams of almonds Collation, 18:30 : 40 grams of muesli (oat flakes, raisins, etc.) + 10 grams of almonds + 20 grams of peanuts + 2 squares dark chocolate 85% of cacao (all of these things are added to the muesli) + 1 banana Dinner : 2 hard-boiled eggs AND linseed and olive oils AND sometimes 2 sardines (or tuna) + 80 grams of rice-quinoa, or 80 grams of lenses, or 80 grams of red and white beans AND carots or green beans or spinash or broccoli AND 1 pear (or two mandarins in winter) AND 1 unsweetened yogurt AND 50 grams of cheese Collation, 22:30 : 1 banana + sometimes, some milk 

Overall muscle development and training is very important for any athlete. Using the example of a boxer like you provided, it is certainly most advantageous for them to practice hands on boxing, but this should be supplemented with other exercises. This is for a few reasons. First, a boxer needs training overall. Jump rope provides training with speed and cardio, both of which are useful to a fighter. Second, the body adapts to training very well. Doing the same training (in this case hands on boxing) will eventually become less efficient. This is why supplementing with other exercises is helpful. Take powerlifters for example. You can absolutely bet that a powerlifter will be practicing his/her squats often. However he/she knows that in order to be better at squats, they should also perform some supplementary movements to focus on the specific muscles which are needed during a squat. 

Your friends are incorrect. Virginity makes no difference in the results of working out. In regards to building strength at that age, focus on building a solid foundation. A proper diet is the most important thing at your age for getting in shape. Sexual history/activity is irrelevant. 

So a good split of 1-Compound, 1-Front delts, 1-side delts, 1-rear delts, and 1-shrugs. And depending on your mood that day, you can add 1 exercise to either side or rear delts to emphasize more on that muscle. This will be a good start for shoulders as an all round shoulder development. 

For maximising muscle growth(Hypertrophy) you need to make sure that you're keeping higher time under tension which will incorporate more muscle fibre against the resistance and incur in a much better growth. A prolonged muscle time under tension, only when fatigue leads to full motor unit recruitment, affects the acute amplitude of muscle protein synthesis and mediates a delayed effect on rates of synthesis during 24â€“30 h recovery. Provided your protein intake is to the point. Time under tension Reference Therefore, increasing your time under tension to about 40-45s will be optimum. The reason you shouldn't look for reps as a rule of thumb is exemplified here. Consider these three cases for Bicep curl(This is applicable to almost every exercise): Case1:- 1 rep: 1second concentric(lifting the weight up)+ 1 sec pause for squeezing the muscle + 2 sec eccentric(lowering the weight) Time per rep = 4sec. Reps required for optimum time under tension = 10 Case2:- 1 rep: 1 second concentric + 2 second eccentric Time per rep = 3 sec. Reps required for optimum time under tension = 13(~12) Case3:- 1 rep: 1 sec concentric + 1 sec pause + 3 sec eccentric Time per rep = 5sec. Reps required fo optimum time under tension = 8 On a personal level, I have experienced more satisfying workouts after incorporating these techniques. Hope this helps. 

Ultimately, it doesn't have a direct relationship with the efficiency of your workout. If you're sweating, that could be caused by a multitude of things (clothes your wearing, temperature of gym, speed of workouts, etc.) Usually sweating while working out is a good indicator that you're get a nice workout in, but that doesn't mean sweat=good workout/no sweat=bad workout. Some people sweat a lot during workouts, some don't sweat much at all. In short, it's very hard to find a solid correlation between sweat and an "effective" workout. If you want to sweat more while at the gym, try to keep your heartrate up while you train. This can be done by taking shorter rests between sets, and working with fewer reps and higher weights. 

If you're trying to bulk up, then make sure you're eating a surplus amount of calories every day and that you're working out. Twice a day is not necessary, and might even lead to more harm than good. Protein powder is another supplement which might be beneficial if your diet is lacking protein. I imagine if you're eating in a surplus that you likely wouldn't need to take any additional protein supplements. Keep lifting heavy weights to promote muscle growth and eating enough so that your body has the materials needed to actually build the muscle. You'll gain muscle mass in time.
