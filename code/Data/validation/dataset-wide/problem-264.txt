So it sounds like the first issue you need to solve is keeping acid completely away from the airway. Damage to the airway could rapidly lead to death. You need to worry about circulatory shock. I'm not sure whether this is directly caused by the acid or whether this is caused by your body's reaction to the pain and damage caused by the acid. You might solve this by IV fluids. If you can keep blood volume up with IV fluids, then organ failure is less likely. Then you should consider means of preventing bleeding. Initially this will involve keep the acid away from vulnerable tissues (e.g. mucous membranes and airway). But eventually, the acid will begin forming ulcers on the skin and the patient will begin losing blood that way too. You can make up for the volume of blood lost with IV fluids, but eventually they'll lose enough to die. Once the blood becomes exposed to the acid through those ulcers, I imagine the acid bath will begin to severely alter the patient's blood chemistry. Eventually, their body will begin dying from the inside and there's not really anything you can do to keep them alive once the blood's pH drops too low. Answering your questions: 

To elaborate on what has already been said, the difficulty lies in making parts of the ammunition (percussion caps) and not so much in manufacturing the fire arms. For fire arms, I'd use whatever is in circulation in the area. If ammunition is available but weapons are not, then make something that could use the ammunition available in the area. For most of Africa, this is likely AK-47 ammunition 7.62 mm (bullet diameter) x 39 mm (cartridge length). But this conventional method of fighting doesn't mesh with the fact that you have an AI directing your defense. Use the strengths of your AI and Western backers. For instance, I'm certain the AI has access to all the information on the internet and has the cpu resources to find just about any reference information it requires. The western backers likely have access to real time intelligence regarding the movements of the warlord and his likely approaches. Why not use superior intellect to defeat the general? Use the knowledge of the internet to construct a series of traps that mangle maim and/or kill horribly the warlord's troops? Use these traps to funnel his troops into an apparently indefensible approach to the compound. In military terms, this is called a killing field. Use your information, tactics, and manufacturing skills to make weapons to annihilate anything that crosses that killing field. For instance, how about a "machine gun" firing those 7.62 mm rounds but controlled remotely by the AI? Maybe the AI doesn't require the volume of fire. Perhaps set the AI up with remote controlled sniper positions - which never (or rarely) miss. Why not do both? Perhaps use a series of small drones (tracked, wheeled, crawling, flying, ground effects) all controlled by the AI for recon, bait, moving explosives around, or even mounting fire arms on them? Have some positions manned by people and others (those you plan / expect to be overrun by your enemy) crewed by the AI. When the enemy troops achieve the objective, detonate large and nasty explosives. Heck with the AI, you can set the explosive to detonate only after a large group of troops assembles on the spot - long after everyone assumed the place was safe. Imagine how demoralizing it might be to have explosions decimating your ranks randomly after you "take control" of a given piece of ground. Any bit of technology, fuel, or weapon which can burn or explode could be rigged to do so. Every time the bad guy "wins" an objective, you detonate it along with large groups of his troops. Anyway, you don't have to defeat this guy, you only have to convince him to move along. 

Alright, I'm done with the little stuff, let's move on to explosions. The problem with explosions (as I stated elsewhere) is that they apply their energy indiscriminately and tend to damage what you want damaged along with everything else around it. 

Yes But it depends upon how you look at it. For terrestrial or rocky planets with iron cores, Samuel's answer is correct. However, there are other types of bodies for which this might not be true. Gas giants For gas giants, the metallic hydrogen at the core works as your conductive fluid and can maintain a strong magnetic field. Whether you consider this a world with a "dead core" is up to you. Ice giants Ice giants cores are likely composed of silicates and metals. Its mantle is composed of various ices. Neither contribute to the generation of a magnetic field. However, these bodies do have strong magnetic fields. The mechanism for magnetic field generation isn't well understood but it is thought that a salty liquid water outer mantle works as the rotating conductive fluid and it generates the magnetic field. In this case, the core is dead, yet the planet still possesses a strong magnetic field. Ceres

The answers to this question may be subjective but I am interested in other's opinions (I have some myself), so please include your selection criteria. Also let me bound the question: You can only use near term (next 50 years) technology. Consider environment factors 

Competing Infrastructure takes up the Slack Don't forget that the US had more than one concentration of high technology devoted to computing and computing infrastructure. Probably the second most important of these was the Massachusetts 128 corridor. However, Texas and several other states had their own versions too. Would the destruction of Silicon Valley have adversely affected the progress of US computing? Yes Would it have stopped the progress of US computing? No Disaster Recovery Plans Most companies have some form of disaster recover plan. 

We'd finish making our Super Orion fleet in 260 years. Estimating cost Let's assume that the amount of labor and difficulty of constructing these Super Orions equates on a tonne per tonne basis with the expense of building nuclear aircraft carriers. US nuclear powered aircraft carriers mass about 100,000 tonnes of displacement and cost 26 billion (USD). Each Super Orion will cost ~2.1 trillion (USD) or about 2/3 of the 2014 US federal expenditures. The fleet will cost 11,000 trillion (USD). Destinations The Earth is the garden spot of our Solar System. Very few places have both the readily available volatiles, metals, and other materials (soil?) that we'll need to survive. IMO, Mars and perhaps a few of the main body asteroids (Ceres is looking really good right now) might fulfill this role. But really only Mars has enough volatiles, metals, and room to host a significant portion of the human population. Where are we going to put everyone? 

A LOT of thought has gone into the question of how to build space stations and use rotation to provide simulated gravity. Space Station built from Shuttle External Tanks 

To use the ITN you must first "pay" the Hohmann Orbit Transfer cost to the nearest Lagrange point (Typically L1 or L2) and then a minimum amount of additional energy to tweak the trajectory as it passes through a succession of subsequent Lagrange points. Travel by this means will take a LLOOONNNGG time, so it won't be used by people or time sensitive goods. For moving large masses of goods this will be the preferred method of transport. Lagrange Points There are only a limited number of Lagrange points available (5 points for each significantly massed body). The most valuable of these Lagrange points will be those near the source, target, and the two gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn). The Lagrange points around Uranus & Neptune might be used if you plan to move bodies in their vicinity. Because of their limited number you might even see "congestion" at these locations for a thriving interplanetary civilization that's busy rearranging the solar system's minor bodies. The shipping "lanes" will be those trajectories that link up the most widely used Lagrange points. The Trojans and "Space Cities" On the surface of the Earth, people tend to congregate at major transportation hubs. For instance major cities have arisen around good sea ports or the confluence of major rivers. If your interplanetary civilization is busy moving minor bodies around, then at least some of them will pass though the Trojan Points / Asteroids. The Trojans occupy Jupiter's L4 & L5 Lagrange points.

1. Getting it near a civilization Generally speaking stars capable of supernova form, burn, and explode long before life could get really established. Also the locations conducive to forming these stars isn't the same sort of location that create smaller stars (like our Sun). However, there is something called Runaway Stars. These are stars moving at very high velocity (relative to other stars in their neighborhood). One type of these stars is formed when one of a pair of high mass stars explodes in a supernova and the smaller star flies into space at high velocity.

NOTE: I consider the substance to be two phase when its partial pressure at these conditions exceeds 0.01 bar (1% of Earth's atmospheric pressure). Anything below that and the loss of gases to space will be significantly reduced due to the small amount of the substance in the atmosphere. Also because it was exceedingly difficult to find the conditions required for partial pressures lower than 0.01 bar for many of these substances. So for a long-lived technologically sophisticated civilization, it may just be easier to periodically refresh the Moon's surface water inventory than to build and maintain a plastic wrapping. How to accomplish it anyway Assuming you want to throw caution to the wind and construct the Moon's plastic wrapper anyway... Materials Start with composite materials. For the matrix material, you will want a durable plastic that's not reactive to either the conditions in space or the atmosphere. The plastic must also be transparent. Something like this PVC (polyvinyl chloride) that's been mixed with a number of other plastics to make it inert. Then embed either glass (for transparency) or carbon (for strength) fibers. You'll want to lay-up the fibers at 60 degree intervals to accommodate stresses in all directions. Structure Rather than making one continuous sheet of plastic across the Moon. Make this as a bunch of interconnected smaller domes. Select a standard dome size and make this the size of each segment. Each dome will consist of a minimum of two layers of dome material. Separate the layers by about 32 feet. Fill the inter layer region with pure water. This provides your terraformed habitat with 3 essential things: 

None of those lead to a "run-away" or "point of no return" climate events - let alone turning the planet into one like Venus. Most likely, now is no different from then. Feedback loops From a controls perspective, the fact that the Earth's climate has remained relatively stable over billions of years is very strong evidence that the climate system over all is a negative feedback loop (meaning it is stable). The alternative (and this is another strong possibility) is that the Earth's climate is really metastable. Meaning, the Earth's climate will tend to return to its current baseline even if you introduce events to push it away from its normal climate. However, if you push hard enough on one climate parameter (e.g. introducing more $CO_2$) the Earth's climate will eventually go through a transition to a new metastable state (probably a higher temperature). Earth Climate is likely Metastable:

Rhodium, the most expensive of the group costs about \$90.00 / gram. Most of the rest cost about \$15.00 / gram. Gold and Platinum cost about \$35 & \$50 / gram respectively. Other Stuff You could also hypothesis that buckyballs and/or nanotubes are found in the craters of carbonaceous impacts (I don't know this is true but it'd be fun if they did). I've got a complete table for Terrestrial concentrations compared to the concentrations found elsewhere (moon, asteroids, meteors, Universe, etc.). Volatiles Viable space colonies will require access to volatiles (gases, ices, etc.) of many different compounds for their own self-sufficiency - water (for oxygen, rocket fuel, & water) and ammonia (using its nitrogen for crops) especially. Other Considerations It is unlikely in near-term space colonization scenarios that any of these raw materials will be price competitive with those produced on Earth for use in the Earthly market. However, they will be highly price competitive or even greatly lower in price for utilization in/on other space colonies, even those in low Earth orbit. So any sort of growing space infrastructure will require plenty of materials from mining sources. It is possible / plausible that some off-Earth manufacturing processes could produce items unique to those environments and highly valuable on Earth from the materials extracted from various sources. For example, it is possible to produce "perfect" ball bearings in zero G environments. We could propose that processes to produce long-strand nanotubes (useful for making super strong cables like those necessary for a space elevator) can only be made in space or on other bodies (like Mars).
