Some resumes run this list together as a single paragraph. However, I prefer this list style to the paragraph of text, as it's much easier to scan. Your resume is your flier, and should be easy to digest by the reader. As a student, you may not have much work experience, but you can list the projects you've completed (both assignments and extra curricular - extra points if you have enough extra curricular projects for a new section). When you do this, definitely list the technologies you used - the information about what you've achieved with a language is a great indicator of proficiency. Finally, remember that it's not an issue to say "I don't know" in an interview - unless your resume made it look like you said you did (so never lie on your resume). 

We are a small team of software developers where everybody knows everybody, and we work in an open space. Naturally, this means that whenever we need to ask a question or get some information that is within the realm of someone else's expertise, we just walk up to them and ask. And this happens frequently, at least once a day. I can't speak for everyone else, but this usually knocks me out of my "flow". Ideally, I could just ask everyone to e-mail me whenever they need anything, but that might be seen as asking for special treatment, and I'm not sure how it will be taken. So, have you ever worked in such an environment? And if so, what are some of the techniques you have used to stay productive/in the zone? 

Since you're new, you might want to introduce yourself to others in the company. With small companies, you can meet and shake hands with everyone in the first couple of days. For practical reasons, in a large company I would only introduce myself to the people who I interact with during the day - whether they're people I work with or just someone I happen to be making coffee next to in the break room. Just say "Hi, I'm the new guy, " and shake their hand. 

The information that you've dabbled in other languages (possibly outside your course) is useful to an employer. However, as others have said, you don't want to represent familiarity with a language or technology you've only dabbled with. There's no reason you can't just list your proficiency alongside each language or library. You could do this in a quantitative way (number of projects completed, number of years of experience), or you could qualify it with some sort of label. I've seen this done using an analogue to spoken languages like this: 

I'm not sure what to make of this situation. Over the years, my manager and I have developed a personal relationship at work. Aside from the regular communication of responsibilities, we joke with each other (and the rest of the team), talk about our lives, families, and other stuff. Thinking back at my previous year at work, I sometimes notice a look of discontent on my boss's face whenever I describe my solution to a given problem (happened once or twice). For the first couple of times, I asked if anything is wrong, and all I got was a "no, no, just keep going at it". Even if you look at my performance reviews, you can see that there are no criticisms there. And no, I highly doubt that this is the case of the oft cited Impostor Syndrome, because I'm often very well aware of what I can improve in my work. Not to mention that I feel that this might be an impediment to me improving at what I do, which is ultimately the most important part of my work experience. Because of this, I've become a little bit uneasy. I worry that our "closeness" (if you will) is getting in the way of him criticizing my work, even though I have repeatedly stated that I welcome this. I keep thinking to myself that next time will be the last straw, and that I will be fired out of the blue. Needless to say, I don't want this to happen, and I would like to honestly discuss this with my boss without being unnecessarily confrontational. So, my question is: should I resign? And if not, is there a way for me to bring it up with my boss in a professional way? 

Usually, I'd just say "Good morning" or "Hello" to the people I see on the way in and my team when I arrive at my desk. But don't worry about it too much. There isn't an expected morning tradition - just smile and say hello when you arrive. 

I personally believe that conveying the appropriate level of respect is unrelated to using their title. For example, it's possible to use the right title and still be disrespectful. I think it is more important to show respect by being polite, listening and valuing what they say, not wasting their time, and so on. 

Of course, keep in mind that you might be asked difficult questions about anything you say "expert" or "native speaker" about - and as a student, nobody is expecting an expert level of proficiency. Consequently, you might also like: 

I'm like many programmers with young careers; I maintain a few pet projects that I use in order to improve my skills in both the domain I work in, as well as the craft of software development itself. Interestingly enough, I was having a discussion with some of my colleagues regarding one of my projects at a company event, and my boss was present as well. After a lengthy discussion, I was asked to bring it forward at the upcoming team meeting, because it could be a nice addition to the company's product line. I'm not sure how I should feel about this. On one hand, the code isn't of much use on my personal computer, and adding it to my company's arsenal would definitely make it a better product, by exposing it to our large team of talented engineers. But on the other hand, I don't want to lose ownership of this project; I work on it on my own pace, I use it to provide me direction on research on topics I'm interested in, and I've been working on it for over a year now. I suspect that some of the answers might come at me and warn me of the potential legal repercussions or conflict of interest issues that might arise with my employer. For the purposes of this question, please ignore this and assume everything is legal. So my question is: Is there an opportunity there, or should I simply bring it over to the next team meeting, and continue work as normal? 

The answer almost certainly depends on what country you're in. It doesn't say on your profile, so here's an answer from where I am (Australia - though I would assume it's similar for most English speaking countries). Shaking everyone's hands at the beginning of the day isn't normal anywhere I've worked - In Australia shaking hands is usually for the first time you meet, or perhaps if you haven't met in a while. I would say it's likely that the managers are just doing this to introduce themselves the new guy. Although you say "regularly" I would guess that: 

It depends on the culture of the university you're at - but if in doubt how to address anyone, you can always ask. At universities in Australia and New Zealand, an informal "Hello" is probably fine. I know of a few departments where formal titles aren't even on the office doors - just names. However - if you're feeling awkward because you're unsure whether to be more (or less) formal - why not just ask? Just smile and say something like "I'm actually not sure how to address you because I'm also a student - what would you prefer?". Most academics I've met prefer informal greetings, and if they've directly given you permission to address them informally, then you don't need to feel awkward about it. Similarly, if they prefer the title, then just treat it as if it were their name, and carry on as usual. 

It is difficult for me to articulate the benefits I've received by simply asking a senior developer for advice with regards to a specific aspect of my craft. More than just telling me the "correct way to do things," often times, they fill this essential gap that can't be filled by looking through tutorials or articles: that we don't know what we don't know, and how can we search for a feautere/language/technique/idiom/pattern to learn more about it when we don't know it exists or the problem it solves? Also, I found it particularly useful to learn how to be more pragmatic than theoretical at my job as a developer, and I enjoy it a lot more because of this. As a consequence of this, I consider it absolutely essential that I have a mentor (I'm still a junior dev) at any potential job I get in the near future, at least. How do I express to my potential employer that I am looking for mentorship from their more senior team members, without sounding like my skills are lacking or that I'm not independent?
