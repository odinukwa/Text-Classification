We didn't only visit the Moon once! Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins were the first manned mission to land on the Moon with the famous Apollo 11 landing, but 5 later Apollo missions also landed safely on the Moon and did various exciting things. This Wikipedia article gives a brief list of all the manned and unmanned missions that have investigated the Moon, and this NASA article gives a nice history of the Apollo program with all the manned missions. (So far the US are the only country to land astronauts on the Moon.) As for why there haven't been more visits since Apollo, there are a couple of points: 1) We have continued investigating the Moon, through remote observation, close encounters and landings, just not with humans on board. The future of human space flight is quite a debated question, since humans are very fragile, have lots of requirements in terms of food, space, health etc. and are not really very efficient at many tasks. Automated investigation of space is by far cheaper and easier. The main advantages humans have are intuition and adaptability. We can change plans, make snap decisions and respond much quicker than a robot controlled by people far away on Earth. 2) Turn the question around: why would we go back to the Moon? Why spend money and time investigating this rather boring lump of cold rock when we could go to places we have absolutely no data on, or very shaky theories, or places that have environments hugely different to our own? If we want to test scientific theories, we often want extreme environments, not just something a little bit different to home. And if, as your comment says, we are looking for other life or future homes, these things are very rare so we will have to look a lot further away than the Moon to find something that interesting! 

Caveat: I'm not a cosmologist, so this answer may not reflect the forefront of scientific knowledge/accuracy, but I have some knowledge so thought I'd share it and hopefully someone can correct me if I'm wrong. The Big Bang theory states that everything is moving away from everything else, so it must have started closer together. We know from the Cosmic Microwave Background that everything was very dense and hot and small. You may have heard that the universe started in a singularity. This means one point at which all matter was in the same place. In this state, all information in matter is lost. No particle can be labelled as having a position or size or spin, because every particle is in the same state as every other particle. This means we lose all possibility of having any information about what happened before this. There are many theories of what could have been before this, but no matter how simple/beautiful/mathematically rigorous the theory, it is physically impossible to know anything about it so they are impossible to test. In some definitions this makes these theories not actually science, as the scientific method involves making testable predictions. 

In a published scientific paper, the significance of any error bars should be explained. If this has not been clearly stated then peer review is not doing it's job. However, in some fields there may be unstated conventions which slip through without explanation. In my own field (star formation) plots which shows averages over a large data set would show means with error bars representing one standard deviation, while plots which show single measured values might have error bars representing calculated uncertainties on the measurement, for example due to detection limits or instrumental uncertainties. 

A fact sheet published by the LIGO collaboration at the time of the announcement of GW150914 (that's the official name of the first detection) gives the peak frequency as "~250 Hz". The Abbott et al. paper also quotes a value of 35 to 250 Hz in the abstract (I haven't checked for more precise measurements later in the paper, I'm sure the OP or other interested parties can do that independently from the link.) So I would say that a value of 250 can be quoted as accurate and referenced to Abbott et al. 2016. 

You want to use this to find the distance from the planet to the star, using trigonometry and converting to the correct units 

These two uses of PSFs are applicable to different situations. Sometimes you know your PSF well enough to deconvolve your image and get something reasonable out of it, but most of the time you have a lot of assumptions in this process and you're not going to get something perfect, so you might want to go the other way and convolve your model with the best PSF you have to get close to your observations. It also depends who you are - often observational astronomers who collect data from telescopes and theoretical astronomers who build models don't talk as much as we should, so you might not have access to all the information you need to do one of these two processes, so you work with what you've got and do the other one. 

It depends what you mean by "very strong". The announced first detection (14th September 2015) was considered a very strong signal and that still only stretched the 4 km detector arms by less than the width of a proton (a tiny particle inside the nucleus of an atom). This wave would have no effect on a person. You could hypothesis a stronger wave that would stretch and squish a person, I'm not sure what effect this would have but there are no objects in nature capable of producing waves this strong, even something as close as our sun becoming a supernova wouldn't be that strong, so it will never happen in real life. 

Let us suppose that "a wizard did it". The law of gravity no longer applies and the motion of the sun is entirely due to magic. First off what about the other planets? If they continue to orbit about the centre of the solar system, they would not move across the sky in the looping orbits that they seem to take. Venus and Mercury would not remain near the sun. If the planets were to move in exactly the same way across our sky, then their routes through space would have to be complex looping affairs. The wizard would be busy. What about the stars? If the Earth is not orbiting the sun then they wouldn't have the yearly wobble in their position. The wobble is tiny but important in measuring the distance of the stars. A wizard whold have to move the whole universe around in a 150million km circle each year for things to be exactly the same 

Low Earth Orbital space is a very big volume. And even though there are lots of pieces of junk, they are distributed throughout this large volume. The pieces of junk are all move at orbital velocity. That means they are moving 8 times faster than a bullet. To catch a piece of orbital junk you would need to match your orbit to the junk, to get your relative velocity down to close to zero. That would require lots and lots of fuel. Now I'm not sure how having an asteroid helps here. Perhaps you imagine the junk hitting the asteroid, and being destroyed. The result of junk hitting the asteroid would be a shower of small fragments - not great. You would still have the problem steering the asteroid into a meeting with a piece of junk. Asteroids are big and heavy and hard to manoeuver, you would need fuel, and lots of it. In short this does not seem to be a feasible solution to the very real problem of space junk. 

Asteroids come in all shapes and sizes, and generally the bigger they are the easier they are to detect. Small asteroids, from a the size of sand grains (properly called meteoroids) to a few meters across hit the Earth everyday without causing harm and are undetectable until they hit (we call the trace as they hit the atmosphere a meteor) They cause no damage. For such objects we get 0 hours warning. Somewhat larger objects can cause some local damage For example the Chelyabinsk asteroid caused damage from broken glass in Russia. Objects this large may be detected a few hours to a few days. The Chelyabinsk asteroid wasn't, and hit with no warning. We have observed some small asteroids just prior to them hitting the atmosphere. We have found large numbers of objects whose orbit can bring them close to Earth. Every object we have found has an orbit that misses Earth. With each new object that is located we can forecast its orbit for several centuries. However new objects are being found all the time. It is possible that a object will be discovered that has the potential to cause damage to a wider area. If the object happened to be on an orbit that had it collide with Earth then there could be less than a year's warning. That is very unlikely. It is slightly more likely that an object will be discovered to be on a collision course only after several orbits, in which case there would be years or decades warning. Very large objects that could threaten the survival of humankind are rare. There are some such objects, (larger than Florence). We hope that we have now detected all very large near Earth asteroids, and discoverd them to be non-threatening (like Florence is not a current threat to Earth) Finally a comet may be on a collision course with Earth. Comets that are spotted are usually detected a few months before they could threaten Earth. But comets are much rarer than asteroids. In summary, between 0 hours and a century, with several decades being likely for an object that could do widespread damage. The particular object referred to in the video is Apophis. It is roughly 400m asteroid that is not going to hit the Earth for as long as we can forecast. It will, however, pass close by in 2029, and again in 2036. In 2005 the uncertainty in orbit was such that we could not rule out a collision in 2036. Further observations in 2006 and after allowed and a more accurate orbit to be calculated, and showed that it would certainly miss. 

If you are in the Northern Hemisphere, it is currently close to midsummer. The Sun is never very far below the horizon in the North, even in the middle of the night. There are plenty of satellites that are visible even late into the night. Heavens Above Most are not nearly as bright as the ISS can be. However, against a dark sky a satellite may appear brighter. Lots of the objects that are visible then are actually rocket bodies. They often have a higher orbit than functioning satellites. 

No. A body in orbit will maintain its angular momentum, it will maintain its rotation rate as it is deflected by the sun. If it is not rotating then the deflection won't change the direction it is facing. (There may be some minor effects that could cause a little rotation but it won't "steer" to face forward.)
