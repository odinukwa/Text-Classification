Your manager is the one responsible for the project. You completed your task by telling him that there may be a problem. If he has a different opinion, that should be fine with you. If something crashes in the future because of non-action of your manager, it is not your problem. If you think this can get severe, document everything you told your manager. Write an email to him about your concerns, maybe cc-ing some others (but don't threaten him, this is only for documentation!). If he blames you afterwards about the crash, you have something to prove your innocence. Bottomline: don't let this get personal. You will do many "useless" or "wrong" tasks during your work life. This is okay as long you don't let this get to you, and you were not the one deciding it. 

Don't leave the impression that you are ashamed of your work history. Be upfront about it, you are the best and everyone should know that. Side note: If many of your positions were very similar or too minor to talk about, you may consider grouping them under a single entry in your CV: 

It could be a trap Realize here there is a chance you've been already caught in the Honeypot, and if you don't report this, you may still have to answer tough questions like why you opened the file. Infosec loves to do things like this, whether dropping a CD in an open area with "Salaries" written on it, or perhaps in this case leaving a document in an easy to find place. The idea around the honeypot is you see something desirable, and then do something you shouldn't (Opening this file). This is a huge weakness for companies, because you can easily be socially engineered to give away your password and cause your company to come under attack. In your specific case, this may well not be a trap seeing that you saw actual salary information, but you should be forewarned that not everything is as it seems. 

An open space is not just about removing walls, it's also about changing the culture of the employees to collaborate more as a team, and not necessarily just person-to-person conversations in a box. Ideally, if you are in an open space, you are co-located with other members of your immediate team. As part of this co-location, open space, you are free to express ideas among team members so that everyone can benefit from hearing the conversation, even if they are not directly in on it. I love when I see open spaces work, Tom and Suzie are talking, and Jim is silently listening. Jim hears something incorrect and can immediately speak up, rather than finding out days/weeks later that something isn't being done correctly. 

I hope I have interpreted your question right. If your Job includes meeting people from your business, that's good. Networking is not about becoming close friends, it is more like building an address book. Talk to the people you are meeting and ask them about what they do (most people like to talk about themselves). Maybe exchange business cards, or just memorize the person. Try to get information from as much fellow businesspeople as you can. Tell them about yourself in exchange. If you don't meet as much people (or wrong ones) in your daily business life, go on trade shows or other events targeted at networking in your part of business. This is a longtime process. If you meet one of your former contacts again, do smalltalk, be visible, update them about you and vice versa. The whole point is that they should be able remember you. If everything works out ideally, soon you will have a full address book / spreadsheet / customer management program full of contacts. And this is basically all it takes. The people you have met don't need to be your friends. They just need to know who you are. If they have a problem/need info from your field, they will remember you and call you. The same applies to you. Problem? look it up in your address book. Giving and taking favours is what the network is for. This keeps on running smoothly as long the other guys/girls don't forget you. So talking briefly once and calling the guy 10 years later won't work. A network needs constant care. 

Request the door be locked where you have to enter a numerical code to get in, and only you and other women are provided the passcode. Problem solved. 

I made this suggestion at a former software company once, it was flat out rejected, even though they had the money and needed the projects done. The response was from Human Resources. Basically they said, if the company offers you projects on the side for cash, then they need to be fair and offer all employees the chance to do work on the side for cash. As this company was used to already getting people to work on extra projects for free in exchange for favors, "wink wink" come raise/bonus time, that would directly conflict in this case. To answer your question though, I'd definitely ask, it's not going to hurt. After it was all said and done, I was not looked upon unfavorably. Actually, my company seriously considered it for a few weeks until the "lawyers" (HR) got involved! 

If you can not be happy with a job, you can not be good at it. Most of the performance in a job or during studies depend on if you are interested in the subject/the field. If you don't like what you are doing you will never reach your full potential. This knows your employer, too. Make him aware of that, tell him that you fear that this job is not a good match for you and resign. Be as professional as you can about it, work your notice period and try to make the transtition as smooth as possible. If your employer is bitter about it, I would not consider it your fault (given you did everything you have to do). 

If you are hired for 40 hours, you have to work 40 hours. If your work is done in less hours, you have to inform your manager that he can assign you more work. If there is nothing to do, you may choose to ask your manager if it's ok to leave early. Me in your place would keep track of the hours I did not work. If sometime in the future there is more to do, I can use those hours. Maybe it is also beneficial to keep your supervisor in the loop about your "minus"-hours. If you do, he can see that you have free capacity. That said, of course you can make any other agreement with your manager. I just wouldn't work less without confirming with the higher ups. 

I would report him, and encourage others to do the same. The best case for you here is for HR to understand how volatile he has become and dismiss him immediately before his notice is up. HR may not care much about what he is saying, but they certainly should care how this is affecting the morale of other employees. 

If you tell yourself you can't do this, then I guarantee your results will be exactly that. However, if you dive head first in these projects, setting up expectations with your boss that you are learning, and may not be able to deliver on time, that will give you the time to learn the right way to do these advanced technologies. As you are learning, check your assumptions with the experts on Stack Overflow. Get some code reviews internally if possible, and if that isn't an option there are other stack exchange sites for those. You can learn this stuff, yes you will make some mistakes, but that is how we get better. I say all this to say, take the bull by the horns and be happy for the challenge! Just some advice from a developer with 20 years experience 

If you do it this way you must be prepared to show exact informations about your work history if asked. Maybe also hint about that in the cover letter. They musn't get the impression that you want to hide something. 

Don't get yourself down. Yes, you are in the weakest position in that team. But you signed a contract and dedicate them your time. So you should at least be told what you can do in that timespan. If your manager does not assign you any work, do a lot of reading. If you are unsure what would be valuable for you or your future employer, try to ask a coworker. Lunch is a great time to ask such questions. "Hey, by the way, when you started here, what was the first thing you had to learn?" Try to do a little bit of smalltalk about what it takes to be a perfect junior employee in that company. Maybe that coworker has some tips about tutorials or example codes for you which you can go through. Just a side note: A company totally ignoring an intern may not be the greatest place to work. I have experienced that also in the past. If they ignore you as an intern, you will not get much more training and attention as a newly employed coworker. 

This is an unfortunate side-effect of a work culture that doesn't thrive on that constructive-criticism feedback loop. You probably aren't receiving this type of feedback, because the people who are reviewing you are not receiving feedback like this as well, nor are they comfortable with giving it. It sounds as if the company as a whole does reviews to satisfy the HR requirement, but no real review come as a result of it. The first half of my career (10 years) was like this, I always got stellar reviews, and no negative feedback. Goals and constructive feedback were almost a joke to the employees in the fact they didn't do it seriously. I grew technically in my position, but the way I related to others was weak (I just didn't know it) I then switched jobs, and immediately I got some good constructive feedback. After I was done pouting about the first real feedback I received, I got to work fixing the problem, and keeping up to date with my manager on how he saw my progress. I realized I craved that type of feedback, and over the course of that job I grew tremendously, and asked my manager on many times if he had any more feedback to offer. I say all this to say, it may be time to consider a job change. There are absolutely companies out there that take reviews seriously, and work out this type of feedback loop. Honestly, if you are looking for career growth, nothing helps more than to have a colleague in your field point out improvements you can make. If you interview, the questions you should definitely ask around are:
