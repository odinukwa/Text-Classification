Update. I here answer the question in the comment: yes, every f.g. finite-by-abelian group occurs. Every such group $P$ can be written as fibered product $P=F\times_\Lambda\Gamma$, where $\Gamma$ is a free abelian group of finite rank, $F$ is a finite group, and $\Lambda$ is a common quotient (thus a finite abelian group). Choose $n$ and an embedding $F\to S=\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbf{C})$, and an embedding of $\Lambda$ into a complex torus $T$ (defining by composition a map $F\to T$). Now embed $F$ diagonally into $S\times T$. Then the fundamental group of $(S\times T)/F$ is isomorphic to $P$ (see Corollary 3.1 of this note of mine with Borovoi; possibly there are earlier references). Finally use the theorem you refer to so as to realize $F$ as stabilizer of some vector for some $(S\times T)$-module. 

Here's an answer for 1: given a LCA group $T$, $\text{Hom}(G,T)$ is LC for every LCA $G$ iff $T$ is a compact Lie group. Proof: Clearly this is a sufficient condition, because it holds for connected tori, and is obviously stable under taking closed subgroup. Conversely suppose the condition is satisfied. Let $\mathbf{Z}^{(\mathbf{N})}$ denote the discrete free abelian group of countable rank. Then $\text{Hom}(\mathbf{Z}^{(\mathbf{N})},T)=T^{\mathbf{N}}$ is locally compact iff $T$ is compact. So $T$ is compact. Let now $D$ be the Pontryagin dual of $T$, so that $D$ is discrete. By the condition and Pontryagin duality, $\text{Hom}(D,G)$ is LC for all LCA $G$. Consider a discrete abelian group $G_0$ (I'll fix it later). For $F\subset D$ finite subset, define $U_F$ as the set of homomorphisms $D\to G_0$ vanishing on $F$. So the $U_F$ form a basis of clopen neighbourhoods of 0 in $\text{Hom}(D,G_0)$. So one of those, say $U_F$ is compact. If $E$ is the subgroup generated by $F$, this shows that $\text{Hom}(D/E,G_0)$ is compact. Now to specify, let us assume from the beginning we picked the group $G_0=H^{(\mathbf{N})}$, where $H=\mathbf{Q}/\mathbf{Z}$. It is a standard verification that if $D/E$ is nonzero, then $\text{Hom}(D/E,H)$ is not trivial, and an easy consequence is that $\text{Hom}(D/E,G_0)$ is not compact, a contradiction. This shows that $D/E=0$. So $D$ is finitely generated, and thus $T$ is a compact abelian Lie group, as required. A careful look on the proof shows that otherwise, $\text{Hom}(G,T)$ is not locally compact for the specific choice of $G=\hat{\mathbf{Z}}^{\mathbf{N}}\times\mathbf{Z}^{(\mathbf{N})}$, where $\hat{\mathbf{Z}}=\prod_p\mathbf{Z}_p$ and $\mathbf{Z}_p$ are the $p$-adics. Edit: the answer for 2. is, as mentioned in another post, that only the circle satisfies the condition. (I initially thought it was trivially true for the 2-torus (or even the trivial group!), while it's trivially false.) Here's a proof. Taking $G=\mathbf{R}/\mathbf{Z}$, the condition implies that $\text{Hom}(\mathbf{R}/\mathbf{Z},T)$ is nonzero; pick $f$; its kernel is finite and the quotient of $\mathbf{R}/\mathbf{Z}$ by the kernel of $f$ is also isomorphic to the circle, so the image is isomorphic to the circle. Now by Pontryagin duality, whenever $\mathbf{R}/\mathbf{Z}$ stands as a closed subgroup in a LCA group, it stands as a direct factor. So write $T=H\times \mathbf{R}/\mathbf{Z}$. Then for every $G$ we get $\text{Hom}(\text{Hom}(G,T),T)=G\times \text{Hom}(\hat{G},H)\times \widehat{\text{Hom}(G,H)}\times\text{Hom}(\text{Hom}(G,H),H)$. Since by assumption the identity of $G$ into the first factor is an isomorphism for every $G$, it follows that all other 3 factors are zero. Taking $G=\mathbf{Z}$, we deduce $\widehat{\text{Hom}(\mathbf{Z},H)}=0$, so $H=\text{Hom}(\mathbf{Z},H)=0$ by Pontryagin duality, hence $T=\mathbf{R}/\mathbf{Z}$. 

Good question! There is a fairly well developed theory of diffeological spaces, with many recent references. The only difference between diffeological spaces and Chen's smooth spaces is that the plots of a diffeological space have open subsets $U \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ as their domains, while the ones of a smooth space have convex subsets. For questions concerning differential forms and tangent vectors, this seems to be irrelevant, so I'll continue with diffeological spaces. As Dimitri pointed out in his comments, a differential form on a diffeological space $X$ is not just a form $\psi_c$ on the domain $U_c$ of each plot $c: U_c \to X$. It must be required for two plots $c_1: U_1 \to X$ and $c_2:U_2 \to X$ such that one has a smooth map $f: U_1 \to U_2$ with $c_2 \circ f = c_1$, the forms satisfy $$ \psi_{c_1} = f^{*}\psi_{c_2}. $$ As also remarked by Dimitri, vector fields can neither be pulled back nor be pushed forward. Hence there is no analogous definition of vector fields. Yet the concept of a tangent space to a general diffeological space $X$ can be defined. A good reference is the paper "Diffeological spaces" by Martin Laubinger (Proyecciones Journal of Mathematics, Vol. 25, No2, pp. 151-178). Roughly, the tangent space at a point $x\in X$ is the sum of all tangent spaces $T_0U_c$ over all plots $c:U_c \to X$ centered at $x$, i.e. $0 \in U_c$ and $c(0)=x$. Then there is an equivalence relation that enforces the chain rule for maps. Smooth manifolds form a full subcategory of diffeological spaces, by regarding a smooth manifold $M$ as a diffeological space with plots all smooth maps $c:U \to M$, for all open subset $U \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ and all $n\in \mathbb{N}$. Thus, for a smooth manifold $M$ we have now the classical tangent space, and the diffeological tangent space. Laubinger proves that both tangent spaces are isomorphic. Apparently less well-known is a theorem of M. Losik showing that Fréchet manifolds also form a full subcategory of diffeological spaces (with the plots defined in the very same way as for smooth manifolds). Thus, for a Fréchet manifold we also have two concepts of a tangent space, the classical one and the diffeological one. I don't know a reference for the statement that both concepts coincide, as in the smooth case, but I have looked at Laubinger's proof and I don't see why the same proof should not work for Fréchet manifolds. Now let's look at the path space $PM$ or the loop space $LM$ or at any other mapping space of a compact smooth manifold into a smooth manifold $M$. I continue with $LM$ for simplicity. There are, a priori, two diffeologies on the loop space $LM$. The first one is the one from the theorem of Losik, i.e. the one where the plots are the Fréchet-smooth maps from open sets $U$ to $LM$. The second one is the one described in the question, it is called the functional diffeology, with plots those maps $c: U \to LM$ whose adjoint $U \times S^1 \to M$ is smooth (demanding continuity for $c$ is superfluous). Luckily, the two diffeologies coincide (see Lemma A.1.7 in my paper Transgression to Loop Spaces and its Inverse, Part I). And here is the result: classical Fréchet theory says that the tangent space of $LM$ at a loop $\tau$ consists of vector fields along $\tau$. The earlier claimed generalization of Laubinger's theorem shows that it coincides with the diffeological tangent space, and the coincidence of the diffeologies on $LM$ shows that it can be defined via plots $c$ whose adjoints $U \times S^1 \to M$ are smooth maps. This is, I think, the best one could hope for. 

Here's a simple, explicit example (with $H$ non-cyclic). Consider the lamplighter group $\Gamma$: it is generated by elements $t,(x_n)_{n\in\mathbf{Z}}$ with $x_n$ commuting and $x_n^2=1$, and $tx_nt^{-1}=x_{n+1}$ (so of course it is generated by $\{t,x_0\}$ as well. Consider another copy $\Gamma'$ of $\Gamma$, with similar elements $t',x'_n$. Consider an injective map $s:\mathbf{Z}\to\mathbf{Z}$ with small supralinear growth. Then consider the HNN extension $$\Lambda=\langle u,\Gamma,\Gamma':ux'_nu^{-1}=x_{s(n)},\forall n\rangle.$$ Then the length in $\Lambda$ of $x_{s(n)}$ is roughly that of $x'_n=t^nx_0^{-n}$, which is roughly $n$, while its length in $\Gamma$ is roughly $s(n)$. Hence (up to some standard details) the distortion of $\Gamma$ in $\Lambda$ is small provided $s$ grows slowly. Yet, one can ask if there are even more naturally occurring examples. 

Indeed if $\mathfrak{g}$ is abelian there is nothing to do, otherwise the center $\mathfrak{z}$ of $[\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{g}]$ (which is nilpotent; I possibly use char. zero here) is nontrivial and the adjoint action of $\mathfrak{g}$ on $\mathfrak{z}$ factors through an abelian group and has an common eigenvector as it consists of a commuting family of trigonalizable operators. [This argument works with no characteristic assumption if $\mathfrak{g}$ is assumed nilpotent-by-abelian from the beginning, i.e. has nilpotent derived subalgebra.] 

3 In a note with Avinoam Mann (Some residually finite groups satisfying laws. Geometric group theory, 45–50, Trends Math., Birkhäuser, Basel, 2007.), we constructed a few residually finite groups including the following one, which answers your initial question: For $A$ an abelian group, consider the free group $W_A$ on the generators $(x_n)_{n\in A}$ in the variety generated by the alternating group $\mathrm{Alt}_5$ (or any non-solvable finite group). (If you're not familiar with varieties of groups, this means the quotient of the free group $F$ on $(x_n)_{n\in A}$ by the intersection of all kernels of homomorphisms $F\to\mathrm{Alt}_5$. For instance, $W_A$ has exponent 30. It embeds into some power of $\mathrm{Alt}_5$ and hence is locally finite. By shifting the generators, we obtain an automorphism of $W_{\mathbf{Z}}$ and hence a semidirect product $G=W_{\mathbf{Z}}\rtimes\mathbf{Z}$, generated by 2 elements ($x_0$ and the generator of $\mathbf{Z}$). Since $G$ is (locally finite)-by-abelian, it is obviously poly-(locally virtually abelian) (in two steps). It admits the wreath product $\mathrm{Alt}_5\wr\mathbf{Z}$ as a quotient and hence is not virtually solvable. That $G$ is residually finite is proved as in the proof of Proposition 6 of the linked paper (cf Remark 7). Namely, consider an element $wt^n\neq 1$ and let us construct a finite index subgroup in which it does not belong. This is trivial if $n\neq 0$, so consider $w\neq 1$ in $W_{\mathbf{Z}}$. It involves finitely many letters, say in $\{x_i:-m<i<m\}$. Hence $w$ survives in the quotient $W_{\mathbf{Z}/m\mathbf{Z}}$ of $W_{\mathbf{Z}}$; this quotient is equivariant for the $\mathbf{Z}$-action, and hence $w$ survives in the quotient $W_{\mathbf{Z}/m\mathbf{Z}}\rtimes\langle t\rangle$ of $G$. Consider the finite index subgroup $G_m=W_{\mathbf{Z}}\rtimes\langle t^{2m}\rangle$. Then in restriction to $G_m$, $w$ survives in the quotient $W_{\mathbf{Z}/m\mathbf{Z}}\rtimes\langle t^m\rangle$, which is actually a the direct product $W_{\mathbf{Z}/m\mathbf{Z}}\times\langle t^m\rangle$. Hence it survives in its finite quotient $W_{\mathbf{Z}/m\mathbf{Z}}$. Certainly your construction is closely related. Indeed, every group satisfying ($\star$): generated by two elements $t,x$ such that the normal subgroup generated by $x$ embeds into a power of $\mathrm{Alt}_5$ is a quotient of the above $G$, almost by definition. So your group is quite likely to me a quotient of mine. I haven't checked if ($\star$) holds for your construction but it seems true or close to be true. [added note 1: it's very close to be true. Indeed suppose that one erases the first two copies, namely $K$ and $K\wr\mathbf{Z}/2\mathbf{Z}$ (this amounts to taking the quotient by a subgroup of order $2|K|^3$, when $K$ is simple), and one finds $b,c$ generating $K$ such $\{b,[b,c]\}$ also generates $K$. Then the group of your construction (at least after modding out these first two copies) is generated by $t$ and $btct^{-1}$, and thus is a quotient of $W_{\mathbf{Z}}\rtimes\mathbf{Z}$.] [added note 2: the FC-center if this group is trivial, i.e., this group is ICC: indeed, if we have $wt^k$ with $w\neq 1$, then the $t^n(wt^k)t^{-n}=(t^nwt^{-n})t^k$ form infinitely elements, since they eventually have disjoint supports. Similarly, $(t^nwt^{-n})t^k(t^nwt^{-n})^{-1}$ form infinitely many conjugates of $t^k$ when $k\neq 0$. Since your groups have an infinite FC-center, this shows they are very different, anyway.] (By the way, this work with Avinoam was initiated on sci.math.research, an kind of ancester of this site). 

Your line bundle $L$ over $BG$ can be seen as a $G$-equivariant line bundle over a point. That is, up to isomorphism, just a continuous group homomorphism $f:G \to \mathbb{C}^{\times}$. Try to lift $f$ along $\exp: \mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C}^{\times}$ on an open cover of $G$. The error is a $\mathbb{Z}$-valued Cech-1-cocycle on $X$, and $E$ is the total space of the associated $\mathbb{Z}$-bundle over $X$. 

If $X$ has a universal cover $\widetilde{X}$, then $\widetilde X$ is a prinicpal $\pi_1(X)$-bundle over $X$. Suppose $$ A \to E \to \pi_1(X) $$ is a central extension. Then, the corresponding class in $H^2(X,A)$ is the obstruction against a lift of the structure group of $\widetilde X$ from $\pi_1(X)$ to $E$. To see this, suppose $\widetilde X$ has transition functions $g_{\alpha\beta}:U_{\alpha}\cap U_{\beta} \to \pi_1(X)$. If the open sets are small enough, they can always be lifted to $E$, but the lifts won't satisfy the cocycle condition. The error in the cocycle formula makes up a 3-cocycle $h_{\alpha\beta\gamma}: U_{\alpha}\cap U_{\beta} \cap U_{\gamma} \to A$. Now, $h_{\alpha\beta\gamma}$ quite obviously represents the obstruction class in $H^2(X,A)$. On the other hand, above procedure takes, on the level of classifying maps, the composite $$ X \to B\pi_1(X) \to BBA $$ with the homotopy fibre of the central extension. And this (I assume) is your "well-known" map. The obstruction class can be represented by a bundle gerbe, the so-called lifting bundle gerbe. The lifting bundle gerbe is a general thing: it represents the obstruction class for lifting the structure group of a bundle along a central extension. Here, it has structure group (or band, if you like) $A$. It is constructed with the fibration $\widetilde X \to X$, and over the fibre product $\widetilde X \times_X \widetilde X$ its "transition bundle" is the pullback of $E \to \pi_1(X)$ along the difference map $$ \delta: \widetilde X \times_X \widetilde X \to \pi_1(X). $$ Bundle gerbes with structure group $A$ have characteristic classes in $H^2(X,A)$, and it is a little exercise to check that the class of the lifting gerbe is the obstruction to solving the lifting problem. 

Here is a solution for $G$ a compact, simple, connected, simply-connected Lie group and $\Gamma$ a subgroup of the center of $G$. The group $H^3(G,Z)$ classifies $U(1)$-gerbes over $G$. A gerbe $\mathcal{G}$ is in the image of the pullback map $$H^3(G/\Gamma,Z) \to H^3(G,Z)$$ if and only if it admits a $\Gamma$-equivariant structure. Indeed, in this case one can form the quotient gerbe $\mathcal{G}'$ over $G/\Gamma$, and the pullback of $\mathcal{G}'$ is isomorphic to $\mathcal{G}$. The crucial point is that the basic gerbe $\mathcal{G}^1$, i.e. the one that represents a generator of $H^3(G,Z)=Z$, enjoys an explicit, Lie-theoretical construction in the framework of bundle gerbes. The existence of $\Gamma$-equivariant structures can then be checked by inspection of a certain obstruction class. This obstruction class has been computed explicitly for all possible central subgroups. For example, the obstruction for the gerbe $\mathcal{G}^k$ over $SU(n)$ (which represents $k \in H^3(SU(n),Z)$) vanishes if either $k$ is even, or $|\Gamma|$ is odd, or $\frac{n}{|\Gamma|}$ is even. That's how I came up with the comment to the question. All constructions and calculations are in: K. Gawedzki and N. Reis "Basic gerbe over non simply connected compact groups" J. Geom. Phys., 2003, 50, 28-55. An overview is in Table 5.1 on page 143 of my phd thesis. EDIT: For non-central groups one can still use the basic gerbe $\mathcal{G^1}$, but I don't know if the obstruction classes are then still accessible for calculations. 

I think the answer is no and that actually the "finite quotient" commutator length (defined by your formula) is bounded on $[F_2,F_2]$. Indeed by Nikolov-Segal, in the profinite completion $P$ of $F_2$, the derived subgroup $[P,P]$ is closed; since the set $C$ of commutators is compact, it follows by a Baire argument that $[P,P]$ is boundedly generated by $C$ (first get by Baire that some open neighborhood of the identity of $[P,P]$ has bounded commutator length in $P$ and then use compactness). Observe on the other hand that $[F_2,F_2]=[P,P]\cap F_2$, which is essentially trivial since the abelian group $F_2/[F_2,F_2]$ is residually finite. So in any finite quotient of $F_2$, the commutator length of $w\in [F_2,F_2]$ is bounded by the universal number that arises as upper bound of the commutator length of $[P,P]$ in $P$. On the other hand, the commutator length of $F_2=\langle x,y\rangle$ is unbounded on $[F_2,F_2]$, as the commutator length of $[x,y]^n$ grows linearly (I think it's due to Bavard). 

Golod (MR link; Some problems of Burnside type. (Russian) 1968 Proc. Internat. Congr. Math. (Moscow, 1966) pp. 284–289 Izdat. "Mir'', Moscow; English translation Amer. Math. Soc. Transl. (2) 70 (1968), 49) produced infinite $n$-generator groups in which all $(n-1)$-generated subgroups are finite, for all $n$. From the MR review: (...) The main theorem follows: For each field $k$ and each integer $d\ge 2$, there is a $d$-generator infinite-dimensional $k$-algebra in which every $(d−1)$-generator subalgebra is nilpotent and $\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty A^n=(0)$. Corollary 1 states that for each $d\ge 2$ and each prime $p$ there is a $d$-generator infinite residually finite $p$-group G whose $(d−1)$-generator subgroups are finite. (I haven't checked but I expect that $A$ is meant to be associative but not not unital and that $A^n$ denotes the subspace generated by products of $n$ elements, which is a two-sided ideal.) 

Assume that a f.p. module $M$ is filtered direct limit of modules $(M_i)$. Recall that this $M$ f.p. means that $\mathrm{Hom}(M,--)$ commutes with inductive limits. So the identity of $M$ can be lifted to $M\to M_i$ for $i$ large enough (say $i\ge i_0$), let $j_i$ be the lift $M\to M_i$, and let $N_i$ be the kernel of $M_i\to M$. Thus for $i\ge i_0$ we have $M_i=j_i(M)\times N_i$. But a direct factor of a module with your additional condition (I think it's called $FP_3$-Property) is still $FP_3$, so it's impossible if $M$ itself is not $FP_3$. So your expectation is hopeless: there is no way to "approximate" by modules with higher finiteness properties using direct limits. 

The problem is the gluing axiom for this stack. To state it, you have to decide for a Grothendieck topology on the category of smooth manifolds. Here you have again the two choices 1 and 2, and some more. According to the calculations I just did (and I should add that it's late and I am tired), all four possible combinations work. So it's again up to you! Personally, I have a preference for the submersions. If you require fibre bundles, it seems that the manifolds in a "connected component" of the stack are all diffeomorphic, whereas it should be possible to smoothly change the diffeomorphism type. 

They key information is formula (5.15) in the latter paper. It expresses the partition function of the WZW model (coupled to a gauge field, and with field insertions) by scalar products of CS states. The next formula (5.16) has (5.15) reduced to the torus, relating it to representations of $G$. 

I'm ashamed to give the following abstract nonsense answer to this excellent question. Also, this is just an expansion of Santiago's first comment above. We'll have to talk about morphisms between Lie algebroids over different base manifolds (these are, for instance, the objects of the Lie groupoids they come from). A morphism between Lie algebroids is a linear, bracket-preserving and anchor-preserving smooth map between the total spaces covering a smooth map between the base manifolds. An isomorphism would be composed of two diffeomorphisms. I am working in the "span picture" and not in the "bibundle picture". I define what a Span of Lie algebroids is, yielding the 1-morphisms of the 2-category Theo is asking for. Let $E_1$ and $E_2$ be Lie algebroids with base manifolds $M_1$ and $M_2$, respectively. A span $E_1 \to E_2$ is a third Lie algebroid $A$ over some base manifold $B$ together with a Lie algebroid isomorphism $A \to E_1$ covering a diffeomorphism $B \to M_1$ and a Lie algebroid morphism $A \to E_2$ covering a smooth map $B \to M_2$. The 2-morphisms are just Lie algebroid morphisms between these "correspondence Lie algebroids". Without having checked all the details, it looks pretty clear to me that this forms a 2-category, with the composition of 1-morphisms the ususal "span composition". EDIT: One can also make up a version with undirected spans by simply ommiting the condition of being an isomorphism. Of course, this doesn't answer any of Theo's interesting "$\bullet$"-questions, but principally one could now possibly translate this "span picture" into a "bialgebroid-picture". Finally, the consistency check: recall that there is a functor from Lie groupoids + smooth functors to Lie algebroids + algebroid morphisms, the latter in the above sense. Applying this functor to spans of Lie groupoids produces immediately a span of Lie algebroids, both in the directed and undirected version. EDIT II: as Theo points out below, that's not totally correct because this functor does not send weak equivalences between Lie groupoids to isomorphisms between Lie algebroids.
