It's possible that during cleaning a grain of sand, for example, has become stuck in the chain causing a stiff link which does not travel cleanly over the cogs. Cleaning chains and cogs often involves a significant amount of moving dirt around before extracting it. A simple test for this is to move the chain through both hands bending every link. You'll find a stiff link very easily. If that's the problem, clean the link until the stiffness goes, re-lube and you should have no further problems. 

It may not be the temperature of the rotors at all. As @cmannett85 mentioned the rotors will cool very fast, much more likely that the pads are starting to glaze over which reduces their coefficient of friction substantially. This will make it feel like your brakes are 'fading'. Hot calipers aren't your problem - the pad-rotor interface is what matters. It's very unlikely that you're overheating your DOT fluid. In my experience, when you are repeating downhill runs (or on a trail with any extended braking periods) you may need to change your brake pads for a different type. I had huge problems years ago with the pads I used to use until I switched to sintered metal based pads. They perform much better over the course of a whole day than the old organic pads. There's probably a little of the 'you get what you pay for' with brake pads. 

It's important to avoid twisting bladed spokes as much as possible, as twisting them ruins their integrity. Try using a spoke holder, which you can buy. Either that or you can easily make your own with plastic or wood. 

I am having trouble finding out which brake set from Hayes this is. I think they are from around 2003 or so. The brake levers were spray painted and I can't see anything about them anywhere. I'm trying to buy brake pads and a bleed kit for them, so if you have any bleed kit recommendations let me know! 

As a bike mechanic on a college campus, I got this question a lot. From my experience, it usually is either the pedal or the bottom bracket. Considering the noise is happening when you are putting torque on your pedal, I would go with it being a bottom bracket problem. Check for play by pulling on the crank back and forth to see if there is some wiggle room, but even if there isn't, it could be that it's just dry in there and you're feeling the ball bearings more than usual. If you've never taken apart a bottom bracket, I would consider getting some help first. If you mis-align the threads screwing the cup back in, you could seriously damage your bike. I'm not sure what type of bottom bracket you have, but if they are loose ball bearings, I would give them a re-greasing, and then make sure to tighten it up so there's no play while also having it loose enough to turn with the greatest ease possible. Even just doing that could get rid of some noises. You could also take apart your pedal on the left side and check the ball bearings in there too, and give them a re-grease. If this is a bottom bracket problem like I predict, and you let it go, your ball bearings will eventually turn into misshapen balls and that will dent the cups in which they roll, which will just totally suck to ride because it will be hard to pedal and annoying to listen to the persistent noise. I doubt it would ever make you crash though. This is a personal picture I took of a bottom bracket with the same complaint as yours, and these are their ball bearings and cage. I'm not sure how he rode it for so long like that actually. 

Pilots have a concept of Aviate, Navigate, Communicate. This is the order of priority for them. To restate for bicycling it could be Balance, Avoid Obstacles, Signal Intent. I don't know whether it is strictly required legally for you to signal, but I'd suggest the practical reality is that you only signal when it is safe to do so and communicating with vehicles behind you could increase your safety. For example, I wouldn't signal stopping or turning left, but generally would signal turning right (in the UK context) well in advance so the car immediately behind me knows what I'm about to do. 

I found this article particularly enlightening. The short takeaway is that balance is the most important thing (before direction) Keep going until the balance is good and everything else will follow. My wife and I are discussing at the moment the best time to get our kids onto balance bikes. 

You could try converting your tyres to a tubeless system. I run much lower pressures on my tubeless mountain bike than I used to - they are super resistant to pinch flats. Every now and then I can feel the rear wheel pinching in a way that would previously have caused an instant flat but to date no flats (touch wood!). I find (anecdotal) that the tubeless tyres seem to lose pressure a little faster than normal inner tubes. Combine that with regular pressure checks and you should be better off. 

When it happened to me and I could not ride elsewhere, I preferred first to acknowledge the waiting drivers I noticed their presence (by raising my hand, so that they don't get into the mood of " this guy is not giving a dam about me") and then taking the first chance to stop on the side and let the queue proceed. I did this even when going downhill on a mountain road and I was travelling around the speed limit of 50 km/h and had trucks and cars behind me. In your case you can consider using the pavement strictly for the time necessary for the waiting cars to take your over. 

Of course no, it doesn't do any harm that the helmet gets wet in WATER. It is made of various plastics, which per se are insensitive to water, and also it is supposed to be worn even though the cyclist is cycling under rain or snow. Also, your sweat is basically water and some salts. If water was dangerous to helmets you should not sweat when wearing them :) Just avoid that it gets wet by organic solvents (acetone, benzene, etc.), as they might attack some of the plastic and drastically alter their mechanical properties, leaving to your head the same protection offered by a shopper. The advice to not paint or put stickers on the helmet comes from the above point, as some paints or glue can contain non suitable solvents. 

Total gear range is limited by chain and derailleur technology and mechanical limits. For example, it's obvious that if you have a very small to a very large cog in the cassette the chain will need to be long to accommodate the length difference as the chain goes around. The derailleur must also be able to physically move the distances involved and take up the slack in the chain. (This, incidentally, is why mountain bikes with their large range tend to have long cage derailleurs) There are limits with how different the cogs can be. It is very difficult to judge the 'high-endianess' of a bike by the number of front sprockets. Some of the most expensive bikes I've seen have only one chainring, either for weight, maintenance or aesthetic reasons. 

Short answer, no! Almost certainly the entire grip should be on the handlebar. Then the 2 pieces of steel pushed in by the screws will tighten against the handlebar giving much better security. The steel pieces should go in the cutouts on the hard plastic inner of the grip. I'm not sure how well the grips will work now that they are missing some of their structure, but it's worth a try. FYI, the reason that the hard part is more difficult to get on is that the multi part grips can get away with a looser tolerance under the rest of the grip, but not where they are actually attached to the handlebar. 

Don't let your rim ever get here, but this is a good example of what your rim will do if you let it go. Letting it go this far can lead to a pretty nasty crash, especially if it's your front tire. It's basically like riding on a ticking time bomb, as the wheel could give out any second. You can definitely feel when your rim starts to become concave before you see it, and when you do feel that, it is time to replace your wheel. On some wheels, there is a little hole called a wear indicator hole. I'm not sure if you ever noticed it on your rim, but if that gets worn away and you can no longer see it, it is also time to replace your wheel. 

I am getting tired of my Mafac Racers on my old Peugeot UO-8 and am looking for a modern side pull style brake upgrade. Are there any brakes that are good conversions to replace Mafacs? Anything I should be aware of before I buy something? 

I don't know exact numbers, but you will know when you need to replace your wheel when the rim starts to have a concave feel to it when you run your fingers over it (I'm talking about aluminum rims here). An extremely bad case will look something like this:
