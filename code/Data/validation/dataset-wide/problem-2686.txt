Different people interpret its meaning differently, but it is consistent with belief in a limited form of free will with a limited form of omniscience. Reason for creation? 

This needs some thought, but is undeniable, because even if anything could make everything disappear, he cannot change the fact that something did once exist. Again, I intend this to be not restricted to time-based existence. This has the following implication for any God: 

Q is a perfectly grammatical sentence that does not refer to itself, so one cannot invoke the circularity objection to the liar paradox variants. But Q still uses the notion of "truth", which can only be imbued with meaning by interpretation in the real world, and as explained in the linked post that is exactly where it fails. To be more precise, Q cannot be justified to be a sentence about reality, and so cannot be justified to have a (boolean) truth value. If Q is a true sentence, then we can deduce a contradiction. If Q is not a true sentence, then we also can deduce a contradiction. But "Q is a true sentence" itself cannot be justified to have a truth value! So we cannot deduce an absolute contradiction. Furthermore, "Q is a sentence about reality" cannot be justified to have a truth value either, so we cannot deduce "Q is not a sentence about reality", although if we wish we can 'go to the meta-level' and observe that we really are unable to deduce "Q is a sentence about reality". For whatever reason, not many philosophers are aware of this resolution of the paradoxes. But "sentence about reality" shares a striking similarity to Kripke's notion of "grounded sentences", because any sentence about reality is literally grounded semantically in the real world. Of course, Kripke had extended grounded sentences to beyond sentences about reality, but that is a whole other topic. Unrestricted set comprehension Now let me address the side-remarks about set theory. 

Note that IEP and SEP are not necessarily accurate or precise, because each article is often written by a single person and not peer-reviewed. In this case, they are only correct if you impose classical logic on sentences (i) and (ii). 

I think there are quite a number of misunderstandings in the terms used. There are certain mathematicians who do not think numbers beyond a certain size exist. Physically the universe seems to have finitely many particles, and so there is an actual upper bound on the size of numbers we can ever write down in decimal notation. We may not even be able to express the upper bound, but it is there. If that is the criterion for "knowing a number", then not even God can write down the answer without first increasing the number of particles in the universe. But that does not mean the answer is not definable, which is a different concept. The largest prime less than 2^1000 is certainly unwritable in decimal, but I have just defined it and every mathematician agrees that such a number exists, except for the ultrafinitists who believe that a number only exists if it can be written down digit by digit. The sequence you linked to is one example of this type, and so Dr. Z's statement must be some kind of joke unless he is an ultrafinitist like Doron Zeilberger. That said, there are certain statements expressed in Peano Arithmetic (PA) that are independent over PA in the sense that there are different models of PA in which those statements have different truth value. (A model of PA is a world that satisfies all the axioms of PA.) One might choose to adopt Zermelo-Frankel set theory (ZF), which is a stronger theory in which there is only one model of PA due to the axiom of induction. Note that "theory" here has nothing to do with scientific "theories". The problem is that ZF is still a first-order theory (quantifying over only single objects in its domain) and hence by Godel's theorem logical entailment in ZF is equivalent to provability in ZF. Because statements in ZF can be encoded using the natural numbers and steps in a proof can be encoded via certain elementary number theoretic properties like divisibility, and then existence of a proof can be encoded, we can then encode the statement of the consistency of ZF itself as a single statement in PA. But that statement would be independent, by similar encoding of a sentence that is intended to mean "This statement is unprovable". (Self-reference is enabled by the encoding.) If it is provable, then it contradicts itself. If its negation is provable, then it is provable and thus the same contradiction comes. So either ZF is inconsistent or there is an independent statement in PA. So there are no competing hypotheses in mathematics unlike in science. Every statement in its full context is either true or false or independent. One can choose different frameworks which may change the truth value of a statement, but there is no conflict. It just means that we can have three frameworks A,B,C such that the statement is true in A, false in B, and independent in C. If you are a platonist, you can say that at most one of the frameworks is correct. Note that we cannot bring God into all this without specifying what exactly we mean by him knowing. It is simply ridiculous to assume that the whole world can be modeled by ZF, and even the natural numbers are idealized notions that do not actually exist in the real world. But if you say you want God to tell you whether some statement is true or false or undecidable in some theory, then if God knows everything then certainly he would be able to answer that. But if you want the exact numeric value you asked about, then how do you expect him to convey the answer? The answer would be required to be in a certain format, such as allowing only certain operations, whether the answer can be "found" depends on the format. In this kind of precise sense and with the above considerations once you select a framework "God" is irrelevant and usually just refers to the truth value in a model, which would correspond to an oracle in computability theory. For example the halting problem is undecidable but, for a platonist who thinks that the natural numbers have a real existence, whether a program halts has a definite answer, and he can then define an oracle to give that answer and investigate what can be done with that oracle. Finally, asymptotics is not guesswork of any sort nor does it have to do with scientific experimentation and approximation. Asymptotics is a mathematical tool that allows rigorous derivations of asymptotic bounds on functions. 

In conventional linguistics, we might call "birds" a predicate nominative, while "are birds" would be the full predicate. The full subject is "all ravens", which the sentences asserts satisfies the predicate "are birds". In languages that support case distinction, a predicate involving an equative verb (copula) usually uses the nominative case, which is the reason the noun phrase in it is called the predicate nominative. For finite verbs, however, such as in "All ravens like people.", you have a subject and an object, namely "all ravens" and "people". In languages with case declension, you will usually find "people" in the accusative case. In English you will say "All ravens like me.", not "All ravens like I.". The whole predicate is still "like people". In general one might say that a declarative sentence is of the form NP+Pred where NP is a noun phrase and Pred is a predicate. Whether a sentence is categorical or not does not have much to do with the syntax, although it tends to use universal quantifiers. The fundamental criterion for being categorical is that the sentence says something about a whole group. For example consider "Flowers bloom and fall.", which has not one quantifier and even uses the present tense, but which every native speaker will correctly interpret as being about the general fact that all flowers bloom and then eventually fall. 

Definitions One has to define "omniscient" (knowing all things) and "omnipotent" (being all powerful) properly, otherwise one runs into trouble without even considering your question. Let's deal with "omnipotent" first. Omnipotence 1 If by "omnipotent" you literally mean "being able to do everything", then consider the following fact: 

It just means that you can think of a polynomial "a + b x + c x^2 + ... + d x^n" as the ordered tuple (a,b,c,...,d), and the "x" and "+" and exponentiation notation are not part of the polynomial but merely there to give suggestive notion. The coefficients of the polynomial are then simply {a,b,c,...,d}, and you can easily define addition and multiplication of polynomials with coefficients from the same ring. By this definition, the polynomial itself does not even include which symbol is used as the indeterminate, although we use "x" in describing the polynomial. For example we have that the product of (1,1) and (1,-1) is (1,0,-1). This is conventionally described by saying that (1+x) * (1-x) = 1-x^2. But the above is not the only definition of polynomials in use. In algebra, it is common to talk about polynomials as if they are the actual strings of symbols written down including the 'powers' of "x" and "+". There are some subtle errors in reasoning that can creep in when one uses such 'intuitive' notions of polynomials. And unsurprisingly, it will be difficult to properly formalize this notion without going back to the earlier definition. For example, we can 'imagine' that "1 + x y + x^2 + y^3" is a polynomial in both "x" and "y", but is it a polynomial in "x" alone or "y" alone? Note that the formal definition of a univariate polynomial as a tuple can be extended to multivariate polynomials, by defining a k-variate power series over R as a function from N^k to R, and then defining a k-variate polynomial over R as a k-variate power series that is zero except on finitely many input index-tuples. Note that a bivariate polynomial over R can be viewed as a univariate polynomial over univariate polynomials over R, in the same way that functions can be curried. 

This is at least one thing that no being, not even God, can do. You may then object that this is irrelevant, but at least you will have to admit that it just makes absolutely no sense to talk about "omnipotent beings" that can do everything because there isn't one. Omnipotence 2 If you restrict "omnipotence" to "being able to do every possible thing", then you still need to define or axiomatize "possible". One way is via consistency, where we define something to be possible if and only if it can be true without being inconsistent with what are already true. (If you know first-order logic, in a first-order theory possible sentences are simply those whose negation is not provable. But my definition here is not restricted to a particular logic.) If we define "omnipotence" this way, then there is still the following fact:
