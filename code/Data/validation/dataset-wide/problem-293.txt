Actually, I think you might have a better shot with the opposite of famine. A post-scarcity world would have little or no incentive for war or conflict. I'm not sure this would work by 2020 if you're similar to Earth, but if you diverge enough, maybe. First step would be nearly free energy, so you're probably looking at an early acceptance of nuclear power, possibly followed by breakthrough in cold fusion (perhaps hastened by the cheap fission energy). Next, you need robotics advanced enough to replace all physical work performed by humans. So, you have a society where dirt-cheap energy is used to gather materials and mass produce every item a person might want, with no human interaction. Pretty much all wars are fought over resources, so that eliminates most war alone. Don't need to steal from a neighbor if you have all you could want. Another cause of war is ideology, which is where you get a lot of difficulty. I'm not sure it's possible to stop people from killing one another over things like religion or sports teams or whatever differences of opinion. One dominant ideology with totalitarian control might be able to do it. Or perhaps you could provide channels for conflict that don't qualify as war. Or perhaps you just lobotomize everyone, or at least indoctrinate them from an early age. 

One solution I don't think I've seen anyone else bring up is to not include the location of Earth in the ship's data. If there is nothing on board that would help locate Earth, then there's no target to redirect to. Don't even have to lie, just make it part of generation 1's agreement to not bring aboard anything that would help locate Earth. You might also need an odd route so that a path can't be traced back simply, and the ship would have to avoid saving data about this early maneuvering. Not sure how plausible this sort of maneuver is. I'm also not sure how much info would need to be censored to prevent future researchers from figuring out Earth's location by looking at simple things like old movies and books, and searching for planets that might fit the description. Of course, the farther from Earth you go before someone starts trying to find it, the less likely it will be possible. You could also send off a beacon of some sort ahead of the ship that would land on the destination planet in advance and which would contain any missing information about Earth, so that after the mission is successful, future generations could locate Earth for whatever purposes. 

Others have discussed code-breaking or code-making, which would certainly be useful, but my first thought was more direct: Artillery One of the early projects in computing had a goal of pre-calculating shell trajectories to support targeting in the field. This is the ENIAC project. I expect a modern laptop could generate the firing tables needed by artillery operators in a fairly short period, giving our side a massive advantage in being able to target artillery quickly in the field. Even if our protagonist knows nothing but basic programming, he should be able to go to the mathematicians working on these tables and coordinate to crunch all the numbers at a speed that would seem like magic to them. 

Not an expert, but I believe you can get a simple form of black powder from just charcoal and saltpeter. You need just the right type of charcoal, so that might take some experimentation to get right, but it's essentially burnt wood, so it should be easy to experiment with. Saltpeter can be obtained from human waste, so while distasteful, it's certainly doable. But this isn't something they could do on the fly, they would have to have been working on this for a long time already, but maybe they have just perfected their mixture and so you can still get some drama of them rushing to mix a big batch from their stockpiled saltpeter and a big effort to make the 'right' charcoal, followed by very carefully attaching a make-shift bomb and laying a trail of powder Wile-E-Coyote style so they can ignite from a distance. 

This affects what jobs might be available and what they entail, but since "what would elite jobs be like" is part of the question, I will assume that society operates in an hierarchical fashion and that social advancement along with accumulation of monetary wealth are core goals for the individual. Enjoying yourself is also a goal, and a part of that is meaningful occupation (at work and in your free time). Jobs in Utopia Physical labor can often be left to non-sentient, necessarily intelligent AIs manning specialized (see industrial robots) or generalized bodies. A human touch may be required if the situation is unpredictable, or if there is the need to have someone take on the responsibility in case of failure. This is assuming that there is enough robotic bodies to go around, But since "androids are running the streets" I feel that it is not unfair. More cerebral jobs would be the go-to for humans and human-level AI under this society. It brings up the further question of how to define the abilities and inadequacies of AI with human-level intelligence. This is a part where you might want to take a few liberties, since the best example of a high-profile AI with something approaching human-like intuition would be IBM's Watson. To continue talking about jobs, this also means that a huge segment of the job-market as we know it today disappears. With no "menial" or repetitive work, that only leaves creative and administrative work (e.g. I'd classify being a CEO as a comibination of creativity and administration), along with any other position that requires someone to hold responsibility. This is usually what we consider elite jobs today, so assuming that the majority of people have work like this we'd probably push the difinition to cover the upper echelons of such work: jobs with the most freedom, the most power and (possibly) the most responsibility. Some jobs that might exist: 

Little brainettes However, underlying all of this is a fundamental question that I have avoided so far: is the human race procreating? And if so, how? If not, then are the AIs we create our offspring? Where do little brains come from, and what happens to rest of the body if they are cultivated in the usual way? If brains come from humans that are grown the usual way, then you are left with the remains of that persons body as hazardous waste once the brain and spine has been removed. Taking care of that may be an extremely unpleasant job, and may thus a thankless, mentally scarring job (at the opposite end of an elite job). If brains are grown without the rest of the body, then that raises a whole lot of questions of it's own. However we can then safely say that the field of human medicin that is worth studying would be greatly diminished, thus the workload of medical students would be greatly changed. In this world, much of the mdical field concerned with the body has been supplemented or replaced with technical knowledge from other fields. (Sorry about the lack of references, unfortunately I'm not allowed more than two since I'm new. The question leaves a lot of free variables, which is why I've included a bunch of questions to consider while world-building.) 

So overall it's potentially a hassle to even have a body, so if someone could offer you hosting for your brain and spine with a good connection to a general purpose informational exchange network (read Internet) where people can share a virual environment, then that may be preferable to a large group of people. For a real-world example of this, look at how many people and companies are choosing to forgo in-house hosting of web-sites and the like, instead choosing to hand hosting over to dedicated providers. Society: You, me and everybody Of course this also requires that the potential clients trusts the hosting company absolutely, since they have no way protecting or defending themselves in the real world and no way to walk away from the company if they were dissatisfied (if the company won't let them). This leads to a potentially abusive relationship: any company or organization dealing in artificial bodies or conciousness hosting (shells) would hold a lot of power over the individual. This leads to a divergence in the way you might want to handle the society:
