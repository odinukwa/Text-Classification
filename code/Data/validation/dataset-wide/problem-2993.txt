This tacitly assumes that being kind, exhibiting an emotional state, is synonymous with being moral. It is not. Governments currently have laws that prohibit people from taking certain drugs except with permission from doctors, like opiates. These laws harm a lot of people. Doctors can be prosecuted for over prescribing drugs even if they only give drugs to people in pain: $URL$ So then what are doctors supposed to do? Should they torture their patients or take a large risk of going to prison? We would be better off if the government cared less about people with respect to this particular issue. 

The characteristic that sets money apart from other goods is that it is accepted and offered as a medium of exchange. Other properties of money, like being a store of value or medium of deferred payments, are a consequence of money's use a medium of exchange. You store some of your assets as money so you can easily exchange it in the short term. There are other kinds of assets you might use as a store of value, e.g. - diamonds or stocks and shares and that sort of thing. A value is something that you act to gain or keep. For example, you value food and that means you act to get food and to keep other people from eating all your food. There is no quantity that measures value. Goods are valued because they solve a problem and in general it's not a good idea to think of value as a measure. Rather, value involves ranking goods ordinally: you value A more than B if you'd give up B for A. That doesn't mean there is some quantity called utility where A has more utility than B. To understand more see The theory of money and credit and Human action by von Mises, and 'Atlas Shrugged' by Ayn Rand, which includes a speech about money: capitalismmagazine.com/2002/08/franciscos-money-speech/ 

We should advocate good ideas. Intervening in other ways might be a good idea depending on the context. If some of the aliens resist their bad culture then we might want to help them to escape, or even use force to stop their mistreatment depending on the circumstances. 

I do not think the value of the Golden Rule is self evident. I think the Golden Rule is a bad idea. The Golden Rule states something like "treat others as you would like to be treated" or "don't treat others in a way that you would dislike being treated." One problem is this doesn't specify what counts as like treatment. For example, a Nazi could say the Golden Rule authorises the Holocaust as follows: "If I were a Jew I would know that I was hopelessly inferior to Germans and so I would want a German to kill me. Therefore I should kill all of the Jews." Another problem is the one you pointed out, namely that under some readings it would lead to acts like maiming and killing in revenge for maiming and killing. The best set of ideas I have seen as a replacement for ideas like the Golden rule is the idea that you should act in such a way as to benefit yourself and you should deal with others on a voluntary basis. The other person is responsible for what he gets out of his dealings with you and as long as he can decline a transaction he need not do anything he thinks is bad, unless he has contradictory views about morality. Force, fraud, theft and threats thereof should be prohibited because they make voluntary dealings with other people difficult. People who commit such acts should pay compensation to their victims if possible. If a person performs acts so bad that it would be dangerous to let him move freely then he should be locked up. The people who most commonly advocate this sort of thing are Ayn Rand and some libertarians, although I think many libertarians make very bad mistakes. For a fairly good explanation of this view see Ayn Rand's books and "The Structure of Liberty" by Randy Barnett. 

If the aliens can create new explanatory knowledge we should treat them as people, otherwise we should not. If they can create new explanatory knowledge we can engage in trade for mutual advantage if we and they follow the appropriate moral ideas. If they can't create new explanatory knowledge then they can't learn or impart good moral ideas, nor can they learn or impart good ideas of any other kind. Treating them as moral agents would make as much sense as treating you car as a moral agent. The idea of a soul doesn't make much sense. Thoughts are abstractions but they always have to be instantiated in some material. The difference between humans and animals lies in the ability to create new explanatory knowledge, not in anything supernatural. You might find it useful to read "The Beginning of Infinity" by David Deutsch. 

You seem to imagine that there is some advanced philosophy behind the Copenhagen interpretation (CI), but this is not true. The CI is a strategy to avoid admitting the actual implications of quantum mechanics, and nothing else. The substance of the CI is that (1) Quantum mechanics (QM) is so strange that it defies the laws of logic and is impossible to understand. (2) QM makes accurate predictions about some things, like atomic spectra. (3) So QM should be used to make predictions about some stuff but doesn't apply to other stuff we are familiar with. Statement (1) contradicts statement (2) because predictions require explanations of how the experiment works, otherwise there is no account of which parts of the theory correspond to what you observe, or how to tell when you've set up the experiment correctly. If QM was actually incomprehensible, the right strategy would be to replace the theory, not fiddle about with it an ad hoc way as practiced by advocates of the CI. Advocates of the CI just prefer to ignore the implications of QM while using its predictions. You talk about wave function collapse and non-locality. Any theory that features collapse violates the Schrodinger equation and so should be counted as a distinct physical theory that may in principle have different predictions, like GRW. The Bohm theory is also a distinct that makes different predictions, not an interpretation of QM and should be treated as such. Such theories may be right or wrong, but they are not QM. QM itself does not feature wave function collapse and is entirely local, as explained here $URL$ $URL$ The option of taking QM seriously as a description of how the world works is commonly called the many worlds interpretion (MWI). But as noted above, the other interpretations are either unclear or distinct physical theories. The link provided above to objections to QM say things like the following. "I can't see how QM reproduces the everyday world." No clear explanation of what is wrong is offered. An objection that can be offered with no explanation can be rejected with no explanation. The objections to the explanation of probability in the MWI similarly miss the mark, as explained here: $URL$ Now, as far as epistemology is concerned, I don't think most physicists have any epistemological ideas. Most of them have some vaguely inductivist ideas. The CI fits with such ideas fairly well since they both have an astonishingly crude view of how experiments and science work. In practice these ideas recommend the following: if at first you look at something and you don't understand it, give up immediately and say it is incomprehensible. Scientists don't actually do this, which is why science is not a complete failure. Scientific knowledge is created by noticing problems, proposing solutions to them and then criticising them until only one is left and is has no known criticisms, as explained by Karl Popper. See "The Fabric of Reality" by David Deutsch chapters 2,3,7 and "The Beginning of Infinity" by Deutsch, Chapters 1,2,11,12 for explanations of quantum mechanics and epistemology that lack the problems pointed out above. 

Inductivism claims that a process called induction can help scientists invent theories and show they are true or probably true or good or something like that. There is no mention of refuting theories. So induction is not supposed to be a means of refuting theories and replacing them with better ideas. As Popper explained, no such process exists. 

Point (a) doesn't follow from your assumptions. If every event is constrained by deterministic laws of physics, such as the Schrodinger equation, that doesn't imply that the only relevant explanation is that equation. For example, bird's wings aren't made out of lead, but the relevant explanation is in terms of evolutionary biology, not the Schrodinger equation. Biological evolution is compatible with the Schrodinger equation but doesn't follow from it. Likewise the explanation for your thoughts in terms of your culture, your attempts to produce variations on the ideas you got from culture, etc. is compatible with the Schrodinger equation but doesn't follow from it. We don't have anything like a full explanation of the process of knowledge creation, thought, etc., but there is no reason to think it has much to do with the low level laws of physics. The explanation is at a higher level of abstraction. A good explanation of many of these issues of both quantum mechanics and higher levels of abstraction can be found in "The Fabric of Reality" and "The Beginning of Infinity" by David Deutsch and "Godel, Escher, Bach:An Eternal Golden Braid" by Hofstadter. 

Evolution selects among genes not organisms or groups. Genes are passed on, organisms and groups are not. So genes can be changed by selection since they can be selected, groups and individuals can't. Social organisms look after one another because they share genes, see "The Selfish Gene" by Dawkins. 

Popper was arguing against the conspiracy theory of society: the idea that bad things happen because some sinister group of people actually plans disasters. For example, the great depression was produced deliberately by greedy capitalists because buy more raincoats when they don't have a job or something. Popper claims the conspiracy theory of society makes no sense because such conspiracies hardly ever turn out as intended. Sometimes people really do plan to do terrible things, e.g. - the Nazis and the Soviets planned to murder millions of people. But they usually fail to carry out their plans fully according to Popper. I think this argument falls down because people do try to do evil stuff and often partially succeed, so sometimes it is appropriate to accuse some person or group of arranging some bad event. Popper doesn't explain when such attributions make sense and when they don't. A better explanation can be found here: $URL$ The problem isn't just a problem with saying that a person wants to arrange some bad historical event, but with saying that he wants it for some secret bad reason. The problem with such theories is that they don't explain what actually happens. Since the motives of the conspirators are supposed to be secret, they are supposed to act exactly as if they believed their stated motives. As such, the alleged reason for the conspiracy plays no role in explaining what actually happened. In addition, there are problems of how to arrange the conspiracy and prevent people from defecting in secret. For example, if somebody had offered the members of the Warren commission a bribe to say Oswald killed Kennedy, then what would happen if the briber didn't pay up? Would Warren have gone to the police and complained that he didn't receive his bribe for covering up for a murderer? And how could the conspirators who approached Warren and the other members of the commission know they wouldn't go directly to the police? Saying Hitler wanted to kill the Jews and that the Soviets wanted to kill capitalists isn't a conspiracy theory in this sense because they openly said they wanted to do that. It may be the case that some Marxists hold a conspiracy theory about capitalists wanting to oppress workers despite the lack of an express intention to do so. I'd guess many Marxists are more in the category of not understanding the economic objections to Marxism pointed out by economists such as Bohm Bawerk, and the moral objections to their ideas explained by philosophers such as Ayn Rand. Others ideas that are commonly considered conspiracy theories should be considered on a case by case basis. The mere fact that a person is suspicious government or doctors or environmentalists doesn't have any bearing on his rationality or lack thereof. There are a few other books on conspiracyn theories that are interesting but not officially categorised as philosophy, such as 'A culture of conspiracy' by Barkun and 'Conspiracy: How the Paranoid Style Flourishes and Where it Comes from' and 'The Hidden Hand: Middle East Fears of Conspiracy' by Daniel Pipes.
