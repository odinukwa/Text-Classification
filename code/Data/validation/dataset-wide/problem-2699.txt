And with that sample set of 4 points, they concluded the distribution was "Gaussian" and thus the experiment demonstrated their discovery. Obviously someone with the resources to collect more data would be expected to gather more data, but in this case 4 "hits" was enough for evidence in scientific law. No one even swore in the detector equipment when it recounted the events of the experiment. Sloppy sloppy! =) 

The topic you are interested is quite a large one. It includes the vast majority of the human condition, ranging from religion to politics to sciences to philosophy to mathematics. Hopefully you don't expect just one answer! Your last question is, in my opinion, the most interesting. Indeed there are those who argue that we cannot know anything at all. These are known as skeptics, and there are a variety of categorizations of them based on how wide of a claim they make. I, myself, am strongly impacted by Agrippa the Skeptic and his 5 tropes, which were then rephrased many centuries later as the MÃ¼nchhausen trilemma, which claims that any logical proof must rely upon one of three things: 

The term "unethical" is often thrown around in non-philosophical venues to mean a variety of undesirable things. Often they have very little to do with ethics, so one has to actually ask what people mean when they claim it is unethical. One aspect I could see as unethical is that it is typically considered unethical to lie. If someone believes they are speaking to a human when they are actually speaking to an AI, there's a bit of a lie by omission when the AI fails to identify itself. However, there's a long series of debates as to whether lies by omissions are the same as activly lying. Another potential issue is that it is generally assumed that conversations are not recorded unless this is specified ("This call may be recorded for quality assurance."). It is yet unclear how AI language processing fits into this. I would not consider this protected in the way race or religion is. Those are protected traits that are treated as a very different class from every other distinguishing factor a customer may have. 

If X is a sufficient cause of Y, then X will show a correlation with Y. However, the opposite is not always true. A correlation can be a general trend with a few exceptions, but a sufficient cause must be true in all cases. Your example demonstrates why. 

One of the challenges of exploring human nature physically is that, in our culture, the opposite of metaphysics is science. Functional physicalism actually makes the claim that human nature is explainable by the structure of a physical world. However, when we think of physics, we think of science. We think of the scientific method, testing hypotheses, and statistics. This proves difficult when exploring the human condition, because typically one thinks of onesself as part of the human condition. One can test others scientifically, and make statements about how they operate. However, while exploring this, you have to ponder whether you are part of this "humanity" that you study. To resolve this question, you have to turn your study onto yourself. However, there is a great challenge here. Science is extremely dependent on well controlled experiments. We take great effort to blind experimentees from knowing too much about the experiment, for fear of it ruining the results. However, it is impossible to do this on yourself. Thus science has a hard time grappling with the self, and physics thus has a hard time with it, simply because many of us define physics by science. Relaxing the rule that physics is not always science, many other physicalist approaches become valid. Also, decreasing the formality of the language makes more approaches valid, if for no other reason than its increased ability to draw upon the human condition. 

Because you mentioned logic, it is worth looking at causality and how it could affect logic. Causality is one common axiom of time. Without it, there is virtually no reason to assume an eternal world is inconsistent. All of the arguments I am aware of for a non-eternal world stem from an application of the rules of causality. With causality, a "first cause," and a finite universe, it is trivial to fit all of existence into mathematical sets. Sets and logic tend to go hand in hand. With causality, and a perfectly cyclical infinite universe, it is also easy to fit all of existence into mathematical sets, but it requires a little creativity to work the loops out. However, there are many causal universes which do not fit into these two categories. Many of them cannot be described with sets, due to their self-referential topology. They must be described in classes. While logic can be applied to classes, most of our intuition of how logic should behave and all of our First Order Logic proof assume the universe can fit into a set. This can lead to all sorts of surprising contradictions if you simply try to treat classes like sets (see Godel, Russel, et.al.) 

I have used "skepticism" in the past. If you hold "knowledge" to the typical standard of "justified true belief," the real question is what qualifies as "justified." Skeptics question the validity of justifications, which in the case of science are in the form of "past performance guarantees future results." The other approach may be to check to see if you both agree on what "knowledge" means. Many people consider the track record of science to be so stellar that it is valid to define "knowledge" in such a way that science can produce it. It really all depends on your definitions. 

As an addendum, with respect to your comment: You asked about a slightly different question, which pre-supposes the Deflationary Theory of Truth to hold. This is a difficult question to answer, difficult enough to be worth editing it into the answer instead of a comment, so that I may correct it if I get the wording slightly wrong. It is difficult because I have brought up an example with Person 1 and Person 2 regarding belief in God which I believe would be considered a rational line of questioning by a reasonable portion of the populace, and I'd like to avoid needing to define "fairly rational," which is used in your question. I find defining most of humanity as irrational is... uncomfortable. The question is regarding language semantics and syntax, so my instinct is to turn to Model Theory and Proof Theory. Model theory is a strange little discipline designed to associate semantic truth to statements. Its dual is Proof Theory, which seeks to define syntactic manipulations which do not modify the truth of a statement. To pre-suppose Deflationary Theory of Truth is to admit a particular proof calculi, while the question is clearly directed at the semantic truth of the statement; this is much better approached in Model Theory. To be honest in my answer, I must phrase it in a format which may appear frustratingly circular. 

Its a difficult topic to do philosophy on because not everyone agrees on how you should treat other's happiness's. We tried the golden rule, and the platinum rule. Both have their quirks. Arne Naess sought a solution which sidestepped the argument entirely. He defined what he called the "Ecological Self" as "that which one relates to." He gave the example of a scientist observing a fly falling into an acidic compound on a slide under a microscope and the scientist's empathy for the fly as it died. He argued that that fly was part of the scientist's Ecological Self. By incorporating such a holistic concept, he was able to turn a lot of the "other people's happiness" debates on their head. For example, he resolves a lot of the conflict regarding altruism through this. Mother Teresa, he argues, was an exceedingly selfish person, but that the Self that she cared about was so wide and all encompassing that nobody could feel anything but warmth around her. Indeed, the ability to equate altruism with selfishness collapses a great many theories regarding other's happiness'. 

It's very difficult to find axioms at the heart of politics because if you hold to an axiom in politics, your opposition will find a way to use it against you. It leads to frustrating axioms that start to sound more like tautologies than anything else. I'd say "There are no black or whites. Everything is grey in politics; except when it's convenient for your cause, then everything is black or white." I'd expect the axioms of politics to be odd structures like that. One thing you could use to divine axioms for politics is to use the age old definition of politics: "Two people having an argument and trying to win that argument by convincing a third person to take their side." That is really the art of politics. From this point of view, one could likely derive axioms for politics from linguistic disciplines like semantics and pragmatics. Those disciplines also help for understanding why the debates on TV are the way they are. You start to see, for instance, why it's advantageous to deflect the question and then talk for several minutes about their campaign platform instead. Sure, it'd be nice to get a straight answer in one of these debates, but if you look at the pragmatics, you find that it's actually an ineffective way of communicating due to differences in contexts between the speaker and the widely varying audience ranging from the social elite to the less educated poor. As for the different ideals you mentioned (capitalism, socialism, etc.), the path I would recommend for exploring them logically is to first do a deep dive into utilitarianism. Utilitarianism is a fascinating tool because the maximization of utility sounds so logically appealing, but the naive approaches for defining utility fall apart rapidly under any decent logical analysis. After tearing apart a few of these definitions, you start to get an appreciation for why successful ideals such as capitalism and socialism are wary of being pinned down to a set of axioms which could be fit into the utilitarian mold while at the same time they seek to act "for the greater good." 

We then need to define a function , known as the successor function, so that we can have numbers greater than 0. Informally, , and so on. 

Actually the two symbols in question, and , have very different behaviors in propositional logic. For 99% of situations, you can interchange them and get away with it. However, in the last 1% the difference is essential to the use of propositional logic. The difference is that the meaning of is formally defined in the definition of propositional logic, while is not. is related to the implication operator by the definition . Implication, , is different from the conditional operator because the meaning of is formally defined and is informally defined. Why this wierdness? It comes up when one tries to define the rules of the language of propositional logic. I could not use the statement to define the operator because I'd end up using it in its own definition! This circular loop is impossible to get away from, no matter how many clever operators you formally define. The solution is that is used informally to define , and then is used to define : Once we define in this way, we can kinda-sorta get away with treating and as the same thing. However, in this initial bootstrapping phase, the difference is essential to the construction of propositional logic and cannot be understated. 

One major limitation is that a consciousness is "aware" of itself, and that causes major effects on how mathematical proofs work. The awareness of self leads rapidly to Peano arithmetic. This is enough to invoke Godel's Incompletenss Theorem, meaning any First Order Logic axiomization of conciousness must be (pick at least one): incorrect, incomplete, unprovable, intractable (specifically cannot be written), or illogical. There are other forms of logic besides First Order Logic, but FOL is the most agreed upon, so we're stuck with Godel's Incompleteness Theorem. The only way out is with cleverly chosen words like "consciousness" that are left ill-defined. This allows the rest of the system to be axiomized properly. Edit: If you are of the sort that believe in finite consciousness, then the hard part of consciousness is not creating one, but categorizing what it is in the first place. Also, if consciousness is finite, arguments about the soul get very touchy very quickly. 

These are important questions, but they are hard to answer with a 2-line definition like Google provides. They require digging deeper into what the scientific method means, and that is where we start to see the vagueness.
