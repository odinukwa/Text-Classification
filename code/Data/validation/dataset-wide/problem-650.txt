Indefinitely. Do inspect them. Some poorly made ones can get hard or brittle. I've only seen than on mounted (unused) pads though, which are more subject to oxidation/sun/contamination etc. 

Lubricate everything, all moving parts of the calliper, inside the housing etc. Wipe excess off. Use a thin penetrating lubricant (tri-flo or similar, not WD40) Be very careful not to contaminate pads, rims or disc rotors though. I once had a sticky cable disc brake calliper (BB7) which I thought had a weak spring. I was putting of the maintenance because I didn't want to get into the spring issue. Anyway I rode with a dragging brake for a long time. Then one day doing other maintenance I quickly oiled the calliper and it completely fixed the problem. An easy solution that I had put off for too long! 

Slice it off with a sharp knife if it is really big because a file will take too long and sometimes the large mass of rubber gets stringy on the edge with a file. Then file the whole pad flat. Re-surfacing the pad is part of normal brake pad maintenance. You want to remove glazing, uneven wear, and debris. Pick out and deep metal chunks with a sharpened old metal spoke. 

If the bike is three or four weeks old it is most likely due for an initial readjustment. It takes a few weeks for the cables to stretch a bit and the derailleurs and springs to seat. This is why most shops want you to return the bike after a month or so to retorque the hardware and readjust the shifters usually for free. 

I own several bikes that all have different stems lengths and angles. The geometry of each bike is different due to the age of the bike and the type of riding. I purchased an adjustable stem. I got it used for about $15. They are available new for about $25. I only use it to figure out what stem will be comfortable. I can change the angle and move the spacers from below the stem to above it, to simulate different lengths. I can then purchase a stem with close to the same dimensions. Several friends have used it with decent results. 

I could see the scenario of riding in really sandy gritty condition where grit might become embedded into the plastic and be transfered to the chain. I have noticed that after cleaning they still have a rough texture.Even if the allloy jockey wheels were softer than the abrasive grit the anodized finish would take a while to wear off. You would also benefit from the bearing being held in position against a machined surface versus a less accurate molded surface 

First I put on a balaclava with a nose hole. There are all kinds you can get, some have more technology for ventilation than others. I find a simple one with a nose hole is sufficient after trial and error for how to wear the mask and other accessories carefully so that my goggles don't fog up. Next is, as mentioned above, goggles. I wear snowboarding goggles which secure around my helmet. The goggles overlap the balaclava so there's no exposed skin on my head at this point, except vent holes in the balaclava. Like the balaclava, goggles range from basic to advanced in terms of ventilation and other qualities. Then I put on a snowboarding helmet with built-in ear muffs. This kind of helmet is better insulated around the edges (especially ears, chin, and back of head) and is all around designed for wet winter use. The downside to this is limited hearing. Lastly I put on a scarf to seal between my neck and my water resistant, wind-breaking, and insulating jacket layers. Scarfs warming my neck also help with my breathing as cold air gives me asthma-like symptoms but warming my neck mitigates that. Another part of my outfit that helps with my head is layers on my hands. I wear thin gloves that I have dexterity in so I can adjust the gear on my head as needed, and then I cover those by wearing thick wind-breaking mittens while riding. The mittens are tethered to my wrists so while riding as needed I can remove the mittens, use my dextrous hand to adjust my outfit (moving head gear around, opening or closing layers of jackets), then put my mitten back on and be all set. Layers are key. 

On your particular shock, it is as you guessed just a cover to keep out dirt. Replacement parts for these shocks are generally not available. I would suggest a visit to a local hardware store and find a generic rubber /plastic plug that will fit in the hole. 

If the bike was inexpensive it is likely a sticker. Can you feel an edge with your finger nail? You can try to warm the adhesive with a hairdryer and gently peel the sticker off. If the glue residue won't come off try alcohol or GOOF OFF a chemical made for that purpose. Try the chemicals on a small area that is likely to get scratched anyway (like the rear drops near the axle slot) in case it damages the paint. If you cannot feel an edge the sticker may have been applied before the clear coat of paint in which case you can't remove them without ruining the paint. 

The cable that moves a mechanical derailleur is counteracted by a spring. To the best of my knowledge the "leave it on the smallest sprocket" theory suggests that the spring is sitting with the least amount of tension on it. The same is true for the cables. Because they have the least tension they are more likely to maintain adjustment over periods of storage. 

Those are the layers that help keep my head warm. Here's more details about them. As noted each part can range in quality and cost. A good helmet is key - don't be cheap about that. I also think high quality goggles are valuable, in terms of ruggedness, ventilation, fit and comfort, and visibility. Your vision is important so you want to invest in protecting it. The balaclava I use is a cheap one, but it does have a nose hole so it isn't the cheapest. It took trial and error to avoid my goggles fogging but I find a nose hole balaclava fit properly and when I have correct posture does not fog my goggles. That fit and posture will probably be unique to you and your setup though. As noted this setup reduces hearing and range of sight. You could probably mitigate that with mirrors but I just compensate with extremely defensive cycling, which is important in the winter anyway because of reduced traction and visibility for everyone. 

Replacing my inner tube, I've been having some trouble getting the tire back on the rim with the bead completely even throughout. For an example of what I'm talking about, see this segment of a tutorial: 

The reason for the bent axles is primarily due to your riding a bike with a freewheel. Freewheels (as opposed to a freehub) have a length of unsupported axle on the drive side of the bike that is vulnerable to bending. That is the primary reason why freehubs were invented. As the bike industry moved more and more gear sprockets (6, 7, 8) this meant a wider cog and longer unsupported length of axle. It is amazing how many cheap modern bikes (Schwinn sold out their name for use on low quality bikes long long ago) are still using freewheels which are an obsolete technology at this point. $URL$ Improperly adjusted or worn bearings are not considered a major factor in having a bent axle unless the bearings are very destroyed and the wheel is not working normally. Bent axles are due to load. So, you using a heavy trailer and being a larger than average rider, the axle is more likely to bend. Get a strong well build wheel with a freehub. If you want an axle of CrMo then make sure you are getting it. There are OK inexpensive wheels for $40 so at $15 per axle replacement (excluding labour) it really makes more sense to not be replacing axles. Joytech is a cheap hub. Buy a good quality wheel that is worth >~$100 and you will save time and money in the long run. I'm curious what you mean by "bearing was catching...just burn it up" That sounds like you may not be adjusting things properly. Maybe review some insructions on doing a hub overhaul or go down to your local recycle a bike shop for some hands on learning? I'm also curious how you could tell specifically by the mile when your axle bent? Normally a bent axle is hard to notice unless the wheel is removed. I find that rear wheel axles even of freehubs can be hard to keep straight. My old parallax hub with an 8spd freehub would always have a slight bend when I took it off to examine it and this resulted in uneven bearing wear. Probably due to me carrying very heavy trailer loads, passengers etc. North American bikes are often designed for sport rather than long term utility so even a tall person may be outside of the design for the bike. My solution was to get an old new XTR titanium axle that was laying around in a parts bin at a shop I did business with. Since then my rear wheel hub has stayed well adjusted :-) 

Check for a local Cycle-Recycle or for one of the many charity bike centers.Some of the charity centers teach local youth bike repairs and they earn a bike in the process. 

I have been using "Foaming Bathroom Cleaner" aka Scrubbing Bubbles and an old toothbruth for about two years with good results. I can't say anything about the long term results as it's only been two years. Your case might be tougher as I think the biggest tip is to clean them before the dirt gets really ground in. 

The larger rotor provides a larger braking surface. A 180mm rotor has more inches of rotor per revolution. The greater mass of the bigger rotor aids in dispersing heat . A single piston caliper pushes one pad against the rotor and deflects the rotor onto the other pad. The advantage of a two piston caliper over a single piston is that each pad is squeezed against each side of the rotor. This increases the clamping force and improves brake performance. The four piston caliper also pushes both pads against the rotor. The extra piston on each side allows for a larger brake pads. Along with a larger pad the dual piston applies the clamping force over a larger area for a more balanced pressure on the pad. The percentage of the pad actually being pushed by the piston is greater. 

You cannot replace Biopace unless you find some antiques. Biopace ended 20 years ago. Other chainrings are all compatible if the BCD is correct. The only issue is the ramps or pins that are meant to improve shifting performance. The manufacturer will always tell you to match everything up exactly but that is their sales pitch. Realistically having something ramped on the middle ring is a good idea and maybe on the big ring too. Ramps on a granny (smallest) ring don't make any difference. If you are really worried about compatibility get something similar (XT, STX, Deore...) with ramps that is from Shimano and you will be just fine. Any square taper crankset which allows clearance for the frame and similar chainline will work fine. Actually buying a complete crankset with all the rings included is a lot cheaper than buying individual rings. The extreme example is a low end shimano riveted crankset for less than $40 vs the typical budget of $1/tooth for chainrings. 

I've never heard of that either. Surely useful to a manufacturer of tubes. I could see it being useful in that it might give you a real measurement of how much rubber you are getting. As you may know, bike tires and tubes are measured with nominal numbers that don't actually reflect the real size of the product accurately. So you might be able to tell how wide a tube is without the nominal numbering. Or, if the nominal numbering is accurate. For example, I've noticed the more recent batches of innertubes we've had at our store are narrower for the same nominal size. This would mean a lighter, thinner inner tube in use (Any size tube will fill the same size space of the tire if possible, less rubber means it has to stretch more to fill the same space). And I've noticed a slightly higher rate of defective tubes. But I haven't actually measured anything, this is just my impression over a period of time. It's hasn't been an important issue. Inner tubes in bicycles are sized quite approximately and one can usually fit the wrong size tube into a tire to make if work if you have only got that one option. I'm someone who would recommend a thicker tube, as I favour that reliability over the small weight gains. So I would use that information to pick wider, thicker tubes. Others might do the opposite and choose narrow for the weight savings. All of this is assuming consistent quality, which is a big if. Anyway, I agree with you there is little need for this number to most people. I'm just expanding on the idea to show there could be some use for a very few. Mostly people who overthink trivial matters ;-)
