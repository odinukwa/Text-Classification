They can be very similar to and sometimes the same as main clause or subordinate clause open interrogatives: 

In short we need to be careful about confusing word categories and functions/grammatical relations. These two things are entirely different. 

A double vertical bar is often used in transcriptions to indicate a major intonational phrase boundary, and a single one to indicate a minor one. 

Again, how you wished to measure the 'distance' of the dependency relationship would depend on what exactly you were trying to show. 

Are there known reasons why these writing systems developed in this way? Does it perhaps have to do with the mediums in which the languages were written or read (for example, on scrolls, tablets, clay)? Do we know? Also, are there languages which go from bottom to top, for example, or in a different format altogether? 

The 'sentence' above will seem odd if not ungrammatical to most English speakers because the verb like usually requires an Object. Such an Object is missing from the phrase above. We cannot use like with its normal meaning without a Direct Object in a straightforward clause: 

For a language that does not have overt morphological tense and any tense distinctions (e.g. Malay), how is it possible to discern whether a clause is finite or non-finite? Is it possible to use aspectual markers as a diagnostic for finiteness and say that a clause that does not permit aspectual markers is non-finite? 

The optional subject of an imperative is usually the second person pronoun. I've found something quite peculiar in Malay, where the utterance is an imperative and is passive but the subject is not the second person. 

What I've found is that word-final /a/ in native Malay words and words up to the time of the Portuguese invasion (16-17th century) undergo reduction, e.g.: 

In order for a nominal to become overt, it needs to be checked by the case filter and be assigned case by proper case assigners. If vocatives really are detached from their respective sentences and are not represented in syntactic trees, how are they assigned case? What case vocatives get in English isn't quite clear. Perhaps someone could tell me what case they get in other languages such as German, Greek, Russian or other languages with rich case morphology. 

In (5) there is a five word interval between the gap and the antecedent phrase. In (6) the interval is fourteen words. However, this kind of interval is of little interest to most linguists, and has little to do with the term long distance dependency. In fact it is sentence (5) and not sentence (6) which we would say best illustrated a long distance dependency in its most important sense. In all the other examples given so far, the antecedent phrase occurs directly to the left of the main body of the clause containing the gap. so if we showed this in (6) we would get: 

Final obstruent devoicing—where a lenis consonant is systematically and cumpulsorily replaced by its fortis counterpart word finally and before fortis consonants—is a feature of many languages, for example Catalan, German or Turkish. This is a case of one phoneme being replaced by another. Notice that this is a phonological rule and is very different from the phonetic devoicing undergone by lenis consonants, in English for example, when they occur next to unvoiced sounds or next to silence. These consonants remain lenis, even when devoiced and the devoicing can in no way be thought of as being 'compulsory'. When said in isolation the [d] in bed is likely to be devoiced, but will nonetheless remain a [d]. 

Causatives have been analysed as a single clause with a split-VP. If the binding of reflexives is only possible intra-clausally, why is there this contrast ingrammaticality? 

Drawing [NP [Det 5][N' [N feet][AP [Adj tall]]]] must be out of the question as "tall" should be the one premodified, not "5 feet". I've drawn this so far. 'X' is the anomalous part in question. 

Nominal predicates in copular sentences are peculiar because in certain languages, they acquire case other than accusative case. Even English was so, e.g. "it is I (NOM)" vs. "it is me (ACC)." Perhaps this is because there is no actual verb that could assign accusative case to them. How do post-copular DPs receive case if there is no actual verb? I've heard that the pre-copular DP gets theta-marked by the post-copular one but I'm not sure where I got that from. Are nominal/adjectival/prepositional predicates considered arguments? Could anyone direct me to literature related to theta-marking and case-marking in copular sentences? 

A house is alienable because it does not obligatorily need to be possessed (not by a supernatural entity, if that's what you're thinking), i.e. it can be a house that is not owned by anyone. Inalienable possession is the opposite in that an inalienable possession is inherently possessed by someone. For example, an arm is always someone's arm even if it is disembodied or severed. $URL$ 

There is a good rule for determining whether to use a [j] (like the first sound in yes) or [w] to link two words like this. The first thing you need to know is that the choice depends on the first vowel and not the second. Therefore in terms of the Original Poster's question, the choice is determined by /i/ at the end of the word be, and not by the beginning of the word ok. Now if the first vowel is either a high front vowel, for example /i/ or a diphthong ending in a high front vowel, in other words /eɪ, aɪ, ɔɪ/, then we need to use a /j/ to link the words. If you think about it, [j] is phonetically like a high front vowel. It is the same type of sound. So this kind of makes sense. On the other hand [w] is phonetically like a high back vowel. When the first word ends in a high back vowel such as /u/, or with a diphthong that ends in a high back vowel such as /oʊ/ or /aʊ/, then we use a [w] to link the two vowels. If the vowel is not a high vowel, or doesn't end in a high vowel, then you may find linking with a glottal stop, [ʔ], in Gen Am. In non-rhotic Englishes (those which don't have /r/ in the coda of the syllable) such as British RP, you will often find /r/ used to link a non-high vowel with a following vowel. 

Are there any cases of doubly filled COMP in contemporary English? Middle English had relative clauses with wh-phrases and complementisers co-occurring. I’ve also read that the variety of English spoken in Ireland can have doubly filled COMP. I’ve found one kind of sentence that could possibly be analysed to have a doubly filled comp… “The more (that) you read, the more (that) you learn.” … but this could as well just be relative clauses though. 

According to the Split-INFL hypothesis, the subject of a sentence moves from the specifier of the predicate to SpecTP to satisfy the EPP and lastly to SpecAgrSP to obtain NOM case. Is there any reason to think that an adverbial intervening TP and AgrSP would cause ungrammaticality according to any theory or framework? 

The existential copula in Malay "ada" remains unchanged in all sentences because of the analytical nature of the language, as well as the lack of agreement and morphological tense in the language. 

In Malay, the wh-phrase in interrogatives remains in-situ, but may move to the left periphery of the clause. 

Here the subscript (i)'s are there to show that our interpretation of the word it is co-indexed with the word elephant. They refer to the same thing. So now we can model our relative clause sentence like this: 

In reality, with many of these constructions there are practicalities which make multiple embeddings difficult to process, for which reason sentences like (7) are relatively rare. So, if we wanted to somehow measure how long-distance the dependency between the gap and its antecedent was in a particular sentence, we would most likely want to quantify this in terms of the number of embeddings involved—in other words the number of clause boundaries intervening between the gap and it's antecedent +. The number of words is usually of less interest to us. If we did want to measure the intervening material though, we might want to measure it in terms of syllables, not letters, characters, words, or phrases. 

However, there are more complex constructions where we do see strings like I like without any overtly expressed Direct Object: 

How do overt subjects of non-finite clauses such as the gerund clause below obtain accusative case despite there being no accusative case or ECM assigner? 

What made linguists rethink the analysis of tough-movement? Was object-to-subject movement inadequate for some reason? 

The subject has to be a NP or a pronoun and can't be a relative clause. This may be because relative clauses are abstract and can't be the things or actions someone would expect to have done or been something. Infinitive clauses should be grammatical, but I'm not so sure. The verb that follows "had better" being infinitive is, I suspect, due to the subjunctive. I can't think of any other example where it would be grammatical to substitute the word "better" with any other comparative (adj/adv), noun, or verb ("better" can be a noun and infinitive verb). Questions: 

Generally, DPs need to move to certain positions or configurations in order to check for case features (among other things) and allow spell-out. For example, raising predicates raise the subject of an embedded non-finite clause to [Spec, IP] of the matrix clause to check for NOM case, which the embedded clause is unable to assign. Mary seems to be sick *It seems Mary to be sick so far, this is true of phrases. 

[Please note that in the end this is not essentially a question about English!] Intervocalic /t/ in Gen Am English may be realised as a voiced alveolar tap, [ɾ]. In words like entertain or ninety where the /t/ occurs after an /n/, it is also often voiced in General American. Given that the nasal stop, /n/, usually involves a full blockage of the air leaving the vocal tract, and that a canonical /t/ is homorganic with a canonical /n/, it is reasonable to suppose that the realisation of the voiced /t/ might actually be an alveolar plosive instead of a tap. So my first question is: is it? Of course, I'm aware that the /nt/ sequence in such words may actually be reduced to a single nasal tap, but I'm only interested in the situation where the /n/ and /t/ are both realised. My second question, however, is whether it's actually possible for a tap to follow directly on from a (nasal or aural) stop made with the same articulators. So, for example, is it even physically possible for [ɾ] to follow an 'unreleased' alveolar [t]? And is it possible for [ɾ] to directly follow an /n/ if the tongue does not lose contact with the alveolar ridge between the two segments? 

The subject is, therefore, unable to be base-generated in [Spec, DP]. Where is it base-generated then? How does the hypothesis account for this? 

One standard assumption is that the subject of a clause originates from the specifier of its predicate, following the predicate internal subject hypothesis. For example, the subject of a simple transitive sentence would originate from [Spec, VP] (or [Spec, vP]) and the subject of a copular sentence with an adjectival predicate would originate from [Spec, AP]. One question arises when DP predicates are involved. In a sentence such as "this is Mary's watch", the specifier of the DP is occupied by "Mary". 

The following data (taken from Adger's Core Syntax) show that certain forms cause mismatching agreement. The dual, in Hopi, triggers both singular and plural agreement. 

This is what I propose, but I'm not sure if it would be accepted by or is theoretically sound for other linguists: 

There is also the use of the existential verb "terdapat" in place of "ada". It's used mostly for the purpose of formality as "ada" is regarded as being less formal. "Terdapat" doesn't have the copular properties of "ada" and is comprised of the non-volitional suffix 'ter-' and the deontic modal/verb "dapat" (can/to get). "Terdapat" can only be used as an existential verb with the non-volitional suffix. Without it, it would mean "to get".
