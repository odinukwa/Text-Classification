Search engines can help you. Google has tools to help you do this. I don't think Google is blocked in Hong Kong, but if it is you can always use a Chinese search engine like Baidu to similar effect. Google offers an option to display only results from Hong Kong (enter search terms, hit enter, tools menu, country selection). If you have a Google account you can also specify which languages you want results in, so limit it to English. Then search for English terms like "jobs" and "english speaking". When I tried this I saw several sites such as www.indeed.hk and jobsinhongkong.com that are dedicated to English speaking users, and have options to filter by jobs that accept English-only applicants. Similarly, you can search for phrases like "location hong kong". Combined with "careers" or "recruitment" that seems to turn up a few employers with offices there. 

The question is vague, as you have realised. Instead of worrying about the exact meaning, consider what the purpose of asking it is. They want to filter out candidates with little experience or understanding, so ask yourself: 

It is unlikely that you will be able to get the salary you want from your current employer, and even if you could get it do you think your boss will be looking to give you a decent pay rise next year? Sadly, leaving is probably your best option. Low pay jobs often are quite good in terms of work environment, because higher pay usually implies more responsibility and thus a more "serious" attitude. 

You should avoid sharing your current salary details. It can only ever work against you. All that information will be used for is to calibrate the offer they make you to be as low as possible while still tempting you away from your current job. This punishes people who are loyal (switching jobs often usually increases salary faster than yearly raises) and who are underpaid. Remember that stating your current salary is the start of your salary negotiation. They will likely offer you around 10% more as a starting point. Its in your best interest not to start with a low number like that and try to work up, justifying a larger increase. You should give them your desired salary for the company in question, which will depend on location (cost of living/rent), type of work and what non-monetary benefits they offer. 

If he started to pick his nose, would you still mirror him? Disregard what others are doing, focus on your own professionalism. As for leaning back - at least here, leaning back in your chair (in a professional setting) communicates disregard for your conversation partner, indicating that you find what he is saying complete rubbish or that you want to show that you are better then to listen to him. In either case, yes, it's (very) rude to lean back in your chair. Two close coworkers may lean back and discuss something, never two strangers. 

If you yawned once, covered your mouth and apologized, it's no big deal. If you do it continuously, you send a message that a) your interviewer is boring you b) you didn't think the interview was important enough to get a good night's sleep. Stretching your arms has the same connotation. As for their reply, there's pretty much no point in continuing, because it's either a genuine concern of theirs, or "random excuse #27" to not hire you. Either way, move on, try to suppress those behaviors and good luck on your job hunt. 

An opportunity to apply your current skills in a real-world scenario An opportunity to learn the use of other skills, preferably from someone more senior than you. And i don't mean only strict technical abilities - so called "soft-skills" are just as important. Many developers starting their careers dismiss the idea that communication, understanding of business requirements, negotiation, assessing time-and-money investments required and simillar are necessary for their career growth. Don't make that mistake. 

I know there are many questions about the dreaded "other duties as assigned" clause in most contracts. Mine has one as well. However, I feel the task assigned to me goes way off what would be expected of someone in my profession. I was recently assigned with developing a process which requires extensive legal and finance knowledge - something I'm not even remotely qualified to do (I'm a software developer). Of course, the logical step would be to ask the legal and finance team for help - they, however, refuse (or are not interested) to provide help. I communicated this to my manager, and his response was basically "I don't care how, do it". Now, I don't have the authority to make the knowledgable folks help me - what are my options in this situation? Am I in the "set sail for fail" kind of situation? 

In my company we still use Skype for internal purposes. One client can have many projects and each of them can have one or more chats (sometimes my list can easily contain dozens of them). Even if you turn off notifications, those chats are always going up and down, blinking, making it harder to look for current projects info (another dozens of chats). Usually when you are being assigned to another client, a manager of former project excludes you from chats of their responsibility. The last time I switched projects one of the managers didn't exclude me from his group chats and recently one of those became so annoying I left it and others by myself. A few moments later a manager of one of the most annoying project's chat said that I was rude and said to just turn off the sound and never leave the conversations. I left that project 2 months ago and will never ever come back to it. The manager was one of the many and not a senior one. We have no internal regulations on this regard and I never had such problems before. But now it bothers me if he really was right. Are there any rules of etiquette that apply in my situation? 

Is it unprofessional? Yes. Should you resign? Don't think so. You can resign, you don't need anyone's acceptance to do it for whatever reason. But you may be not so lucky to find one more company like that. If you eventually resign, don't tell your future employers the real reason behind it. It will damage your chances to get another job greatly. Should you just sit and wait? Totally No. Get up and tell your manager about your situation and make some proposals on how you think it can be solved beneficially to both of you. Ask if you can shift your schedule if it's temporal issue. In many companies managers understand that anything can happen in life and they can help you. But they need to know about when you'll have your piece of work done to plan further. Keep them notified and most of them will be satisfied. BUT you MUST make them know. It seems like your company puts up with it. Hang onto them. If it's just your behavioral problems - your vacation won't change anything. Learn how to get over them. It may impede your carrier and life. Such situations may happen endless times. You'd better learn how to solve them on the fly. P.S. I'm from Russia and a programmer too. FYI If your company has annual vacation plan, they have every right not to let you go on vacation. 

Disclaimer: this is coming from Eastern Europe culture (or at least my experience of it). You don't specify locale, so YMMV. 

What I think you misunderstand is working knowledge versus book knowledge. When someone says "Do you know (insert a language) well?" he doesn't mean "Have you memorized every bit of documentation, know all the overloads of every function etc.". They usually mean "Can you look at the code and easily (identify flaws/introduce changes/fix bugs/refactor/etc.)? Can you make an informed decision on what tools to use for a given scenario? Can you outline the advantages and disadvantages of proposed solutions?". Many languages are nearly identical in the general idea: syntax may be different, a few concepts done differently and some of the caveats are unique to a language, but if you know for example C# well, you would have little trouble if someone asked you to do something in Java. You need to keep your knowledge current: again, it doesn't mean that if a new framework comes out, you need to know it by heart in the next week - but the knowledge that such a framework exists, what are it's advantages over competing solutions, what scenario would that framework be used in and in what scenarios it shouldn't be used etc. That's, in my understanding, keeping your knowledge current. If on top of that you can type the code without the use of any aid such as documentation, more power to you - but do remember that it's not the main thing. Knowing a solution is ok. Knowing there are 10 possible solutions, their strengths and weaknesses, where to find their implementation - that's even better. It is possible to find a job with what you know so far - albeit it will probably will not be a job of your dreams. You should however strive to find a job that offers you: 

I want to end with a statement that may be true only in my region (Eastern Europe): When it comes to job offer "requirements" section, you can often come across postings that seems to require you to be a combination of embedded programmer, web designer, application architect, mobile developer, database administrator and it wouldn't hurt if you would be a sysadmin also. Don't be disheartened by those offers, many times people writing them just copy-paste whatever google returned as "smart sounding programming words". If the job description sounds interesting to you, apply and assess the job-offer personally - ideally after an interview with someone "technical"
