If we're being completely logical, this soldier would be much more useful off the battlefield where he can turn any sort of motion into electrical energy by turning a turbine - wind, waves, enemy airplanes overhead, anything that moves gets turned into free electricity. Or he could use the energy to transport things. He could probably get things to orbit much more cheaply than is currently possible - just store enough energy to get up there and then ride the rocket all the way up. He doesn't even need a return capsule, he can just jump off the rocket and manipulate his own kinetic energy to fall back to Earth nice and slowly. Who cares about radiation? He can just recharge his powers by absorbing the energy of the charged particles around him. But seeing as you want this to be an interesting story, and not one about battlefield logistics, he could make an incredibly good air-defense system. Depending on the range of this ability he could literally stop aircraft and missiles in their tracks, letting them fall harmlessly wherever he wishes. 

Your creatures must have some biological or environmental factor that prevents exponential population growth when they develop technology and civilisation. This will prevent competition for scarce resources becoming cause for war. They also have to be more altruistic and less greedy than humans. The first is the hard one. For an egg laying species, at least unwanted pregnancy ceases to be a factor. Now let's imagine there is an uneasy symbiosis with a tick-like creature that manufactures or injects some vital nutrient for its host, but which grows exponentially into a plague if the density of hosts becomes high. A bit hand wavy but it might work. As for altruistic and less greedy I find myself imagining sentient house sparrows. They pair bond for life and bond strongly in small flocks like loose extended families. They are highly gregarious with other flocks and other species. And they have lots of "affairs" outside of their pair bond yet only death of the partner can break that bond. If that happens they do not grieve and bond almost immediately with any unattached sparrow of the opposite sex. The new pair will continue to raise any orphaned chicks. Chicks are cared for and taught by adults long after they leave the nest. ( if you want comprehensible but alien social structures, look at the birds we share our planet with. Above is just one of thousands). You might also get an absence of war if the species were very strongly individual and capable of participating in a society only at a learned intellectual level. They could never accept orders for long enough to form any sort of army. You'd have (possibly ritualized) combat between individuals instead of wars. Hmm ... weren't Niven's Kzinti like this? 

Regarding the Casimir Effect, I'd give a pretty hard no with a pretty simple reason - the Casimir Effect is an attractive force between two uncharged plates. If you want to create a gun using it, you're going to run into the issue that these two plates are going to hit each other. If anything, the Casimir effect will actually decrease the power of a railgun, as it will work to "suck" the projectile back into the barrel. But even putting that aside and getting to the math, the Casimir effect is really very weak. Its strength is given by $F = \frac{\pi h c}{480 L^4}A$, where $h$ is Plank's constant, $c$ is the speed of light, $L$ is the distance between the plates, and $A$ is the area of the two plates. This site gives a quick example to demonstrate just how weak the force really is. Using plates 1 meter square, placed 1 micron apart we get $F=\frac{\pi * 6.6 * 10^{-34} * 3 * 10^8}{480 * 10^{-24}} * 1$ $F = 1.3 mN$ 1.3 micronewtons is not enough force to do anything at all really, so I'd say forget about it. 

Flex your brain muscles Humans have brains that evolved to do some thing well, like pattern recognition , and other things not so well, like risk assessment. Make your magic system use a piece of the brain that it just isn't good at, making your user devote greater amounts of resources to continue the practice. This is your system so you can hand wave an area your humans are poor at understanding and claim your magic requires that they do it. This also gives you the opportunity to explain why another race or species would be good at your magic. 

Child Care In our current world we have a rising rate of single mothers. They require things like daycare, school, and after school organizations to keep their child in relatively safe locations and under super vision while the mother is at work. With most people entering the work force by the end of 6th grade your society would have a higher birth rate than right now. With more children you need a larger child care workforce and what better way then a government subsidized baby sitter who also tries to get your child an education and better job? 

See FOOF. Pack some of this into a warhead somehow and I dare you to find a way to make it stop burning. Dioxygen Difluoride is a particularly reactive compound of already particularly reactive fluorine and oxygen. It's ludicrously dangerous production method as well as its reactivity with essentially everything, at any temperature make it fairly famous in the chemistry community. See the wikipedia page for details, but it truly does react with essentially anything. The main difficulty with such a weapon would be that it would tend not to stick to hull of the enemy ship as it decomposed, but this would be a problem with pretty much any reactive agent, which is likely your best bet, aside from nuclear weapons. 

One approach is travel at the speed of light. It needs some handwavium to accomplish but does not create causality paradoxes. For the traveller it is as instantaneous as teleportation, but if he travels 50 light years it is a one way trip 50 years into the future, and the only possible return is to a century in the future of his home. Check out Ken Macleod's "engines of light" trilogy, where the journey is eight thousand light years, to a destination that was not of the travellers' choice. A variant is to transport the traveller's mind state by radio or laser signals into a body built at the receiving station. This is easier if s/he is an advanced robotic construct rather than biological. Check out Charles Stross "Neptune's Brood" which includes some intriguing speculation on nature of interstellar money and finance. 

Delving deeper! Luckily for anyone who wants a thorough, scientific analysis of this option, I'm not highly original and laser reentry of space junk has been studied! One particular paper DOI: 10.1016/j.asr.2012.02.003 goes quite in-depth, and I'll cite some of its more important findings here. First, how big of a problem is space junk? 

Your suggestion about a cylindrical container is an interesting one. A cylinder will not be stable on reentry without some help, but I think spinning the capsule could be enough. Get it spinning fast enough and you'll start to get some lift. You can then use this as a means of controlling the landing zone (no left/right control but you should be able to get up/down control) by varying the rate of spin. The two ends of the capsule come off to allow the parachutes to do their work, and the parachutes should be mounted on bearings so that the cables don't get tangled up when the chute deploys. Just make sure that you make the capsule strong because the aero forces over such a large area could be an issue.
