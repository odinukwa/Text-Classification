Note that a relatively small Mongol army was able to control a huge territory through sheer terror. If you resisted, at all, your entire village would be slaughtered. As a result even when the main army moved on the conquered population remained submissive. 

Projectiles will be basically useless. No mass behind them and air would stop them very quickly. You can take inspiration from existing animals operating at those scales but really the standard solutions of sharp poky things (spears) and sharp slashy things (swords) would work. I'd expect blunt smashy things (hammers) to be far less effective than at larger sizes for a similar reason to the problem with projectiles. The strength of materials relative to the mass of the hammer is so much higher than at higher scales. Aiming for weak points in enemies would be far more important as shells/carapaces would be very effective defenses at this scale. 

Well, I'm going to add an option: crust-buster bombs. That's right, ladies and gentlemen, we've created weapons capable of simultaneously creating a hole from the surface to the mantle and the pressure waves necessary to trigger an instantaneous volcanic eruption through that same hole! Thanks to our new handwavium technology, this awesome force can be yours for the mere price of... (Terms and Conditions may apply, not guaranteed to work in areas with thicker-than-average crust such as existing hills and mountains.) I'm sure you can find some sort of way to justify a world where people went crazy with the crust-busters and basically turned the entire planet into a series of volcanoes for a few months. Bam!!! No more flatlands. If you want a more 'natural' explanation, I can't do better than Andrei. 

One solution could be to build enclosed mass cities for all humanity, and whatever flora and fauna we can save. Since the disaster has been predicted and has not taken place yet, the time remaining to humans (hopefully a couple decades before the disaster) could be spent collecting all manner of flora and fauna, and putting them in a protected, sealed environment. It may be possible to artificially create an atmosphere in such a city, through chemical reactions, and biological processes. Food, water, supplies, etc. could also be stockpiled up, but contingency plans must be put into place, so humans can learn how to build on these resources: re-learn how to make materials needed in an artificial atmosphere. With the right regulations, such a civilisation could possibly exist for a while. The main problems would be the extremely high cost of building such massive cities, not to mention the time required to stockpile resources and conduct research and experiments on how to regulate the atmosphere and environment in the cities. The humanity problem would be how to decide who gets to live in the cities, and who dies outside, unless you could build cities big enough for all humanity. But other than that, basically, we're all living in bubbles in the middle of a ruined earth. Eventual relocation to space may be a consideration. Or you could just wait for the atmosphere to 'reboot', if that's possible. 

The goal here is to create a society where people mostly just die of old age, don't get mental illness, and live very healthily for most of their lives. I recognize that this would create some weird social dynamics (like where STD people get ostracized like crazy or where people with bad genetics are social pariahs.) Those should be (relatively) short-lived. 

So you have several options. A lot depends here - where are the ocean currents and prevailing winds coming from? 

Well, you can say what you want about society and stuff, but I'd prefer to focus on improving the life of the individual, given this wizard's powers. Therefore, let's focus on removing some of the worse problems. 

Heat - any organic material we know of is going to struggle to survive a temperature of between 700 and 1300 degrees centigrade. Even extremophile lifeforms that survive around volcanic vents or springs can't survive 200 degrees. Pressure and density - This is still rock we are talking about it's pretty solid and heavy stuff. Life is more likely to float on the top than sink. This stuff is around 2.5 times as dense as water and we can already float in water. Viscosity - Lava is much thicker than water. Swimming (already hard to to the density) is much much harder work due to the thickness of the substance you are swimming through. 

Well, there's a loophole if I ever saw one. In fact, in a magical universe, this should be downright easy to work around. We just have to use magic to alter him or his surroundings so that he will be helpless to save himself regardless of how much time he has. 

If there's anything that humans are good at, it's deforestation on colossal scale. The hard part is getting humans to not deforest a region. Worst-case, assuming this super-forest is supernaturally tough and resistant to all known herbicides and fire, just drop your spaceship on them. Atmospheric re-entry heat and pressure should be more than sufficient to clear space. 

How much adaptation are you allowing for here? Our existing earth mammals would struggle with increased gravity, and larger ones would struggle more. If all you are asking about is humans adapting then there is an answer here: Would the human body support living on planets with a greater gravity than Earth? However in the more general case of life adapting to the conditions I can see life adapting to survive in much greater gravity fields. 10G? No problem. 100G? maybe. What's the limit? We have no idea. Physical structures would change, bones would be thicker and stronger, creatures would have more legs or at higher gravity levels no legs at all. Mammals shaped like snakes slithering over the surface of a 20G world sounds plausible to me. Organs would be arranged and function differently, height differences would be minimized (so expect flattened bodies) and nothing would jump or fly. Even small falls are likely to be lethal and climbing extremely hard so most creatures would live on the ground. Burrows and caves would be both dangerous and unlikely so expect small hollows and nests to be the preferred way to live. 

I personally prefer having they in front of me, physically. So I'd recommend writing/typing out brief explanations of your concepts. Just a few lines each, that can fit on a piece of card/paper maybe the size of your hand. One concept per card. Print them out and arrange them in front of you (maybe 10 cards per row, work your way from left to right, and downwards), then when you're happy with the arrangement, number them in pencil. Maybe best to worst, or in chronological order, etc. So it's easier if you need to move things around in future, then you can just change the numbers. This way, after you're done arranging and numbering, you can just sweep them up and keep them in a stack, without worrying about forgetting the order. As you formulate your ideas, go through the concepts one by one. 

One way would be polarization, if the mirrors were tuned to only reflect light with a certain polarization and the vampires reflected light with a different polarization then the mirror would not reflect their image. Some special property of the vampire would cause this polarization. The problem with this idea is that you would get a black shadow where the vampire should be though. In fact that would be a common problem with most possible solutions, it's already not easy to make a vampire disappear from the mirror. Making what is behind the vampire appear in the mirror though is far harder still. There are only two real ways I can see to do this: 

Tl;DR - Creativity and aesthetics are the reason - machines can do the job, but they can't make it look good, and you're trying to make a planet for people to live on, eventually. Summarizing your problem: The destination environment is a total unknown and the HE-MUU's goal is to set up the industrial base and core infrastructure for the planet, in preparation for human colonization. Sounds good, but guess what, humans hate living in ugly places and machines are bad at guessing what humans think will look good. Most humans are too, for that matter. What I'm saying is that there's no way to make a computer that can guess how to turn a completely unknown planet into something humans will find appealing, so you need at least one human to figure out how to make this new planet look pretty. Why only one person then? Let me ask: have you ever painted by committee? Have you even tried to make a small website by committee? That's how you get ugly, and preventing ugly is the main reason to send a person anyway. So, you have to send one person because even just two people is too many cooks in the kitchen. Finally, if they do a bad job, then you can try and repair it, but you still want to leave creative license in the hands of one person even then. Meanwhile, I think it'd be relatively easy to find artists who would be willing to spend a decade with an entire world for their canvas. Maybe it could be the apprenticeship for some super-exclusive artist guild. Train for a few years, then spend a decade building your ultimate masterpiece, your legacy, your eternal contribution to the universe!! Billions of people will know that your artistic genius is why they have those fjords! You could even win an award for those fjords! And then after your decade, you come home to a really, really nice career doing whatever you want and never need to work another day in your life unless you feel like it. Heck, I'd probably be willing to do that if I got to call/write home occasionally.
