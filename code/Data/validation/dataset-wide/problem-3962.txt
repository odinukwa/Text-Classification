Regarding the general question, from the point of view of conformal field theory there is a rather trivial way to obtain (some) $D^\omega(G)$. Namely, the representation category of the $G$-orbifold of a holomorphic (trivial representation category) rational conformal field theory is $\mathrm{Rep}(D^\omega(G))$ for some $[\omega]$, see Corollary 3.6. in $URL$ But I have now idea if as Scott pointed out as a comment all finite groups $G$ (I suppose yes) can be obtained this way; one has to find a holomorphic theory with an action of $G$, for example the Moonshine CFT for the Monster group etc. Then for a given $G$ I also have no idea which $[\omega]$ arise this way. I think it also follows conversely, that if a CFT has $\mathrm{Rep}(D^\omega(G))$ as representation category, then it is a $G$-orbifold of a holomorphic theory. But then I don't understand the non-holomorphic examples the op mentioned. In the non-holomorphic examples you have to mod something out to become (the dual of) $D^\omega(G)$ 

This is just an answer to part of the question, namely how to determine $S$ from the fusion rules in the case of "modular data". See also chapter 5, here $URL$ for a comparison between the characters of a group and the $S$-matrix of a unitary modular tensor category. If you know all fusion matrices, you can in principle calculate the Verlinde matrix $S$. You need that the fusion rules are abelian. Then the matrices $N_i=(T^k_{ij})$ are commuting and you find a common set of eigenvectors $e_i$, i.e. $$ N_j e_i=\lambda_{j,i} e_i.$$ Let $e_0$ be the vector with the greatest eigenvalue and normalize it such that $e_0=(1,d_1,\ldots,d_n)$. They also fulfill (using Frobenius reciprocity and commutativity) $$ N_iN_j=\sum_k T_{ij}^k N_k. $$ Applying this to $e_0$ you get $$ d_id_j=\sum_k T^k_{ij} d_k, $$ in other words $d_i$ are the Perron-Frobenius dimensions. Then the Verlinde matrix should be given as: $$ S= \frac1{\sqrt{\sum_i d_i^2}}\left(e_0,\frac{e_{\sigma(1)}}{d_1},\ldots,\frac{ e_{\sigma(n)}}{d_n}\right), $$ where $\sigma$ is a permutation of ${1,\ldots,n}$ and $e_i$ are normalized such that the first entry is 1. 

I don't know about generally accepted, but $\log^{(n)}X$ seems pretty concise. It conforms to the usual notation for functional iterations and there is no room for confusion with either taking powers or using different bases, e.g. $(\log_2^{(n)}X)^k$.

Actually, matrix-valued differential forms are used a lot in hypercomplex analysis/hypercomplex geometry, which, as the name suggests, includes certain complex manifolds. There is a nice account of such differential forms in Rocha-Chavez, Shapiro, and Sommen "Integral Theorems for Functions and Differential Forms in $\mathbb{C}^m$" (2001) (~200 pages). The first chapter is a general introduction to (complex-valued) differential forms, the second chapter discusses differential forms with values in the 2x2-matrices, and then the book goes on into the realm of hyperholomorphy, including hyperholomorphic Hodge theory. 

A vastly improved support for handwritten math (e.g. via digitizer pen) incl. its conversion to typeset math would be awesome! In a long run, ideally it should be able to replace LaTeX. Just think of how much of researchers' time is spent on inputting math. 

I would say, it depends on how much Differential Topology you are interested in. Generally speaking, Differential Topology makes use of Algebraic Topology at various places, but there are also books like Hirsch' that introduce Differential Topology without (almost) any references to Algebraic Topology. Having said that, topological theory built on differential forms needs background/experience in Algebraic Topology (and some Homological Algebra). In other words, for a proper study of Differential Topology, Algebraic Topology is a prerequisite. Addendum (book recommendations): 1) For a general introduction to Geometry and Topology: 

Disclaimer. I am just talking about the chiral part of a conformal field theory. The chiral parts of WZW model are described by affine Kac-Moody algebras. I am describing how to obtain the Kac-Moody algebras starting with abelian currents (derivative of a free bosons). $n$ free Abelian currents $\{J_1,\ldots, J_n\}$ correspond to target space $\mathbb R^n$ and compactifying the target space by a lattice $\Lambda\subset \mathbb R^n$ corresponds to add a vertex operator $V_\alpha$ for every point $\alpha\in \Lambda$ of a lattice (or just for a basis). By compactifying the target space $\mathbb R^n$ with a root lattice in the case of a of a simply laced Lie algebra (all roots have the same length $\langle\alpha,\alpha\rangle=2$) one obtains the affine Lie algebra of this corresponding Lie algebra at level 1. Namely the $J_n$ and the $V_{\alpha,n}$ with $\alpha\in\Lambda$ and $\langle\alpha,\alpha\rangle=2$ form a basis of the affine Kac-Moody algebra at level 1. The simple simply laced Lie algebras are exactly the one with A,D,E Dynkin diagram. That is basically the Frenkel-Kac construction: I. B. Frenkel and V. G. Kac. Basic representations of affine Lie algebras and dual resonance models. Invent. Math., 62(1):23–66, 1980. Some other one can get by conformal inclusions, for example $G_2$ at level 3 embeds into $E_6$ at level 1. I guess one obtains all level 1 cases by regarding conformal inclusions $(C_n)_1\times SU(2)_m\subset D_{2m}$ and $G_2\times F_4\subset E_8$. Finally level $\ell$ one can embed in the $n$-fold tensor product of level 1 by $$J_a^{(\ell)}(z) \sim \sum_k 1 \otimes \cdots \otimes \underbrace{J^{(1)}_a(z)}_{k\text{-th position}}\otimes \cdots\otimes 1$$ 

Let $L/K$ be a finite separable field extension and let $\theta$ be a primitive element for $L/K$ with minimal polynomial $\mu(t) \equiv \mu_{\theta/K}(t) = \sum_{k=0}^n c_k t^k$. I am trying to compute the powers $\theta^n,\dots,\theta^{2n-2}$ in terms of $1,\theta,\dots,\theta^{n-1}$. In other words, I am trying to compute the structure constants of the basis $1,\theta,\dots,\theta^{n-1}$ in terms of the coefficients of $\mu(t)$, but the expressions quickly become unmanageable. I can hardly imagine that I am the first one to attempt such a calculation, so my question is 

Formally, the answer is "yes, of course, by simply translating all the winding number stuff in Artin's proof back to homology", but I hope it's clear by now it's not what I have in mind as reasonable. The motivation is to be able to present a general Cauchy Integral Theorem as early as Cauchy-Goursat, in particular before introducing $dz/(z-a)$. 

Notice that using the dual basis with respect to the trace essentially seems to run into the same issues. I have looked into J.S.Milne's notes on Fields and Galois Theory and on Algebraic Number Theory as well as in Neukirch's Algebraic Number Theory, but in this regard they don't seem to go beyond calculating the discriminant. 

Addendum: As can be seen from Timothy Chow's answer, the statement in Stewert and Tall's book that "Miyaoka had used a technique parallel to that of Wiles, by translating the number-theoretic problem into a different mathematical theory — in this case, differential geometry" is actually a bit misleading in that regard. For, in fact, he did the opposite - he tried to transfer notions from differential geometry (and related alg. topology) to the arithmetic world rather than give a differential-geometric (in a strict sense) proof. Sorry to get the hopes of our differential geometers too high! 

An euclidean theory which fulfills the Osterwalder-Schrader axioms gives a Wightman theory on Minkowski space via analytical continuation of the correlation function by the $URL$ E.g. a 4 dim theory gives a Wightman theory on 3+1 dim Minkowski space, so there is no additional dimension... 

At the end of Section 14.1 in Pressley, Segal "Loop Groups" there is the remark that the partition function is a modular function in the sense that the Dedekind $\eta$ function is a modular form. I am interested about the following remark: 

Take $C$ to be the category of dualizable $N$-$N$-bimoduls, $N$ a factor. A subfactor $N\subset M$ (or $N_0\subset N$) with finite index and finite depth gives an algebra object $A$ in $C$, namely $A={}_NM_N$ (or ${}_NL^2M_N$ if you prefer) and conversely an algebra object (more precisely a Q-system) gives a subfactor $N\subset M$. Instead of building artificially a category of subfactors, you take the category of (simple) algebra objects (Q-systems) in $C$. Each finite group gives an object $A_G=\bigoplus_{g\in G} {}_NN^{\circ\alpha_g}_N$ with $\alpha_g$ automorphisms on $N$ such that $\alpha_g\alpha_h=\alpha_{gh}$ for $g,h\in G$ and ${}_NN^{\circ\alpha_g}_N$ is ${}_NN_N$ seen as a $N$-$N$ bimodule, where the right action is composed with $\alpha$. A morphism $H\to G$ gives a morphism $A_H\to A_G$ between algebra object. This category contains also finite groups, their duals, Kac-algebras and weak-C${}^\ast$ Hopf algebras. If you want irreducible subfactors, you ask $A$ to be haploid, then you lose weak-C${}^\ast$ Hopf algebras. This also tells you how a "category of subfactors" should work... 

Maybe some of the following statements are not precise. Please correct them. Let $M$ be a compact smooth manifold. Let $f: M \to {\mathbb R}$ be a Morse function. Then a generic Riemannian metric $g$ satisfies the Morse-Smale condition: for any two critical points $p$ and $q$, the unstable manifold $W^u(p)$ of the negative gradient flow of $f$ of $p$, and the stable manifold $W^s(q)$ of $q$ intersect transversely. Trajectories of this flow that connect $p$ and $q$ will approach to them exponentially. Now suppose $f$ has a degenerate critical point $p$. Let $q$ still be a non-degenerate critical point. Assume sufficient genericity, $p$ is then of "cubic type", i.e., near $p$, $f$ can be written as $f(x) = f(p) + x_1^3 + \sum_{j\geq 2} \pm x_j^2 +$ higher order terms. Now it seems to me that the unstable set $W^u(p)$ won't be a manifold in general, but a stratified space, with the top stratum= trajectories that approaches to $p$ polynomially(because there is a degenerate direction), and a lower stratum= trajectories that approaches to $p$ exponentially.(Is $W^u(p)$ necessarily a manifold with boundary?) And now, to ask about the transversality of $W^u(p) \cap W^s(q)$, it should be in a sense of stratified spaces. Is there any original paper that discuss this transversality? I know that Floer has two(maybe more) papers: The unregularized gradient flow of the symplectic action; Morse theory for Lagrangian intersections, which talked about the transversality about non-transverse Lagrangian intersections. Indeed his argument can be carried out for Morse theory. I wonder if there is any more original and more elementary argument about this transversality?

If $\gamma$ is smooth with $D\gamma$ of rank $1$ everywhere, then $\gamma(\mathbb{S}^1)$ is a submanifold ($\gamma$ is injective by definition and $\mathbb{S}^1$ is compact). In particular, it is a connected manifold, and we have a well-defined topological degree $\deg(\gamma)$ since it does not depend on a choice of a regular value of $\gamma$ on the image. This is one straight-forward generalization of the case $n=2$ for curves in higher dimensions. There are probably other approaches as well. Outerelo and Ruiz introduce $w(f,a)$ for continuous $f$ defined only on hypersurfaces $X:=\partial\bar{U}\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$ (for some $U$ open and bounded). In particular, the construction does not seem to work for curves for $n\geq 3$. More generally, the topological degree appears to be defined only for maps whose domain and codomain are of equal dimension. (In this interpretation and modulo technical details, the winding number in the plane is the degree of a map defined on the unit disk which restricts on the boundary to our curve.)
