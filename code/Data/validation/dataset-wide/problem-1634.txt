A 2016 study showed coconut oil pulling to be a safe and effective alternative to Chlorhexidine mouthwash since there was a significant reduction in Streptococcus mutans count. 

The ideal body fat percentage (BFP) % calculated in a competition was between 5.6 and 6.7 for twenty-four athletes 

There are differences between women's experiences of the hormone fluctuations and negative mood experienced before menstruation and there is no confirmation of corelation existing between mood and menstrual cycle. 

Researchers Newman & Hunt 1966 found that employees enjoyed the background music, but there was no effect on their productivity. Music goes best with repetitive tasks that require focus but little higher-level cognition. A landmark 1972 study in Applied Ergonomics showed that music goes best with repetitive tasks that require focus but little higher-level cognition since it found that factory workers performed at a higher level when upbeat, happy tunes were played in the background. This research by Fox & Embrey 1972 reveals listening to background music helped improve the efficiency of performing a repetitive task. Employees in relatively simple jobs responded most positively to the stereos. A study ''Listen while you work? Quasi-experimental relations between personal-stereo headset use and employee work responses.' by Greg R Oldham et. al. in 1995 showed that for employees with simple, routine jobs, enhanced relaxation caused their increases in performance, while decreases in distractions improved their attitudes toward their jobs and the company but for others, it will have the opposite effect. 

Is there research evidence to back up the above claim that people will be in less risk to be affected by Alzheimer's if they perform those four activities? 

A summary of research in 2001 on negative consequences of hypnosis inappropriately or ineptly applied, Robb O Stanley and Graham D Burrows conclude that adverse effects can arise through the use of hypnosis in clinical and other settings. These effects can be transitory and mildly distressing. However they caution that there might be potential for serious deleterious effects including suicidal acting out when inappropriate hypnosis techniques are applied and there is additional care needed in selecting appropriate techniques when dealing with persons with or without prior history of similar medical or mental problems. 

WHO's bottom line: Full prescription course of antibiotics must be taken irrespective of the length of course of antibiotics. 

Research shows that women in some countries do not report negative mood disorders before menstruation in the same levels as other countries. However, they seem to report the same physical changes. 

Alcohol is known to disturb sleep in healthy people at high doses and and may be beneficial in low doses in insomniac people. 

Insomnia is a sleep disorder in which there is difficulty falling or staying asleep and this can be categorized either as primary insomnia or comorbid insomnia. Comorbid insomnia is commonly associated with substance use disorders such as alcoholism. 

There is no clear link established between stress and gray hair and also there is no proof for the theory that stress by itself causes gray hair. 

Research shows that the amount of natural pesticide consumption is more than the consumption of synthetic pesticides. The protection offered by natural pesticides in crops is sometimes noted to be less when compared to synthetic pesticides as found in a study comparing the effectiveness of a rotenone-pyrethrin mixture versus a synthetic pesticide, imidan which showed that up to seven applications of the rotenone-pyrethrin mixture were required to obtain the levels of protection provided by two applications of imidan. 

A meta-analysis involving 19 studies by DeNeve & Cooper in 1998 found no correlation between intelligence and happiness. A study by Ruut Veenhoven et.al. in 2012 involving 23 studies done in ten different nations and involving 15,827 respondents found no correlation between IQ and happiness for childhood IQ and present day happiness or for current IQ and current happiness. 

There are RFID chip ID cards available in the market based on RFID tags. RFID stands for Radio Frequency Identification, and it provides identifying information on a tag that may both receive and transmit information at radio frequencies. There are three types of RFID tags: active tags, which contain a battery and are constantly transmitting some sort of data such as vital signs, passive tags, which require external source such as a scanner to create a signal in a device without battery, and then battery assisted passive, which function as something of a hybrid of the two in that an external source is required to activate the battery functions. 

Wolffish normally grow up to around 110 cm and the largest ever recorded wolfish was approximately 150 cm. Mutagenic studies of endpoints including body weight and length of fish suggest that chronic irradiation interacts with other environmental variables to influence the degree of response, although the irradiation itself appears to be a minor contributor. The 'giant' wolf fish caught between the mainland and Hokkaido island by a fisherman named Hiroshi Hirasaka (images of which he shared on Twitter) was around 110-120cm in length which was quoted by the fisherman himself as "they are the average size (TL110-120cm) in this area". This 120 cm wolf fish is small when compared to the largest ever recorded wolf-fish of 150 cm. 

The claim "forbade the selling of women and kidnapping of women" is true since it was prohibited by the Mongol customary law as shown below. 

Also an April 2016 analysis by Caroline Kitchens, Senior Research Associate at the American Enterprise Institute found that the '1 in 5 women on campus has been raped' claim was similar to a lie since the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) estimated that about 1 in 52.6 college women would be the victims of rape or sexual assault over the course of four years. The '1 in 52.6' BJS statistical number of rape in college women is further analysed here. 

TL;DR: Extensive research shows that naturally occurring level of formaldehyde in humans is 0.8 to 8.0 parts per billion and the levels of formaldehyde to which most people are exposed in the normal world are not high enough to be toxic. However, more research is needed to confirm whether formaldehyde in cutting boards can migrate into food and cause toxic effects on human health. 

Several medical organizations such as the ones mentioned below have agreement about the injuries caused in Shaken Baby syndrome/Abusive head trauma found in children. 

With further updates on Dave PhD's answer, a change to the earlier law which legally acknowledged the marriage between minors if it was legally performed in the country of origin is not now valid since the current age criterion for such marriages is 18 in Netherlands. 

There are claims like this and this that low frequency sounds can cause people to see apparitions. In certain individuals, low-frequency sound is claimed to induce feelings such as fear, dreadfulness or depression and animals are also claimed to react to such sounds. Some films such as Paranormal Activity and Irreversible, a French film are also claimed to use such sounds to induce fear in audiences. So does low frequency sound cause people to experience weird paranormal experiences and phenomena such as ghost sightings? 

There is no predictable pattern in detecting mood swings in women based on the hormone levels since varying levels might have different mood effects in different women. Men also tend to experience fluctuations in hormones and mood swings but there is no exact mechanism like a menstrual period to track it. 

There is also actual linguistic errors noted in the Quran which is mentioned here found by scholars Burton and Dashti and a German scholar Gerard R Puin challenges the conventional understanding of the Koran with the following statement. 

"Tyranny is probably established out of no other regime than democracy"-This is recorded in The Republic of Plato by Allan Bloom and viewed here as a Socratic dialogue with some creative liberties. However, the original Socratic quote is "And so tyranny naturally arises out of democracy, and the most aggravated form of tyranny and slavery out of the most extreme form of liberty" which is recorded here. "It's freedoms multiply, until it becomes a many-coloured cloak decorated in all hues".-This is recorded in The Republic of Plato by Allan Bloom and viewed here as a Socratic dialogue with some creative liberties. However, the original Socratic quote is "This, then, seems likely to be the fairest of States, being an embroidered robe which is spangled with every sort of flower. And just as women and children think a variety of colours to be of all things most charming, so there are many men to whom this State, which is spangled with the manners and characters of mankind, will appear to be the fairest of States" as recorded here. 

Summary: Feathers are either from the left or right wing of the bird since using feathers from both wings in a single shuttle cock would affect the flight trajectory of that shuttle cock. 

Syncope also commonly called fainting or “passing out” is a medical term used to describe a temporary loss of consciousness due to the sudden decline of blood flow to the brain. If one is about to faint, there are a lot of accompanied symptoms described here. There are also several types of syncope which have specific trigger events or they seem to occur through other causes such as dehydration, BP medication and other medical conditions. If it occurs very often without a triggering event, it might be a sign of an underlying heart disease requiring medical attention. Prolonged standing associated with heat or emotional stress can cause gravitational blood pooling in the lower extremities. This might act as a trigger for the fainting spell and may be amplified by the knee locking. 

Consumption of tobacco or smoking of cigarettes as a aid for nicotine intake is still harmful either in work, play or life due to its addictive and abusive potential and also because of the relation between cancer and chemical ingredients present in combination with tobacco which is demonstrated in several research studies. 

He was also even appointed as Professor later in 1855 which should mean that he was not entirely ignored or shunned by his peers. 

Referring to Snopes, this claim is false since the original video showed activist Ihab al-Khouli reacting angrily to a speech by former Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi. The original transcript is found here. 

This shows that the cognitive process behind one's perception of objects is the same that one uses when looking at women, and both genders are guilty of taking in the parts instead of the whole. When one looks at men, he or she uses global processing to see them more fully as people. 

Currently there is insufficient evidence for calculating an optimal dose of nicotine to obtain cognitive benefits in nonsmokers. 

The rising price of imports relative to exports caused by a depreciation of the dollar reduces the purchasing power of U.S. consumers and businesses that purchase the imports. The American Institute for Economic Research Cost-of-Living Guide in 2009 states, "No matter what the politicians and monetary authorities say, the buying power of the dollar continues to decrease." 

Summary: Based on current research, there is evidence from several studies that higher tax on drinks with high sugar content might reduce sugar consumption. However, researchers feel that the levied sugar taxes might only reduce the average sugar consumption globally by a small amount. 

The absorption rate of aluminum through the skin is still not exactly known and there is no difference in the concentration of aluminum between the cancer and the surrounding normal tissue when studied in women with breast cancer. 

Gatorade contains oral sucrose which has been reported with increased rate of alcohol removal from blood Soterakis J, 1975. However, more hang over research is needed to make sure that it was the effect of the sugars and not other variables that reduced the alcohol content in the blood in a larger randomized population since the small number (n=8 of total participants) and the type (alcoholic male participants) had an effect on these findings. Screening for hangover severity and frequency may help early detection of alcohol dependency and substantially improve quality of life. 

However, the details are used for updating or preparing charts of the top viewed music videos or TV shows and audio songs. 

There is some difference in certain women developing PMS or PMDD since those who develop PMDD are noted to be highly sensitive to hormone level changes. 

Sunlight exposure is one of the several factors contributing to premature aging of the face along with the formation of coarse wrinkles. 

TL;DR: Olive oil is a healthy fat but it is not as healthy as canola oil, fish oil and flaxseed oil. 

TL;DR: Skin is affected by exposure to UV irradiation from the sun and repeated exposure to harmful factors in the environment is noted to cause the typical photo aged skin having coarse wrinkles. However, the effect of sun-exposure causing these wrinkles is difficult to quantify or measure. 

Evidence: Freezing at 0 °F is known to keep food safe by causing microbes to be dormant and prevention of microorganism growth. However, home freezing cannot be trusted to destroy parasites such as trichina and there are reports of food contamination from frozen products such as ice cream which had previous pathogen contamination. 

PMS disorder is a mixture of physical and psychological symptoms associated with mood and hormonal fluctuations before menstruation. 

Lemmy Kilmister is well known for his lifelong large intake of alcohol and this relates to the stated toxic effect of alcohol on his blood in 1980 (Lemmy's blood could be intoxicated by alcohol due to a daily bottle of Jack Daniel's since 1975 until 2013 unless he sobers up). In the documentary 'Live Fast Die Old', it was revealed that Ian Fraser "Lemmy" Kilmister drank a bottle of Jack Daniel's every day and had done so since he was 30 years old. A 750 ml bottle of Jack Daniels contains 28-30 units of alcohol (40% alcohol by volume) and the NHS recommends men should not regularly drink more than 3-4 units of alcohol a day. "Acute alcohol poisoning" is a related medical term used by healthcare providers to indicate a dangerously high concentration of alcohol in the blood, high enough to induce coma, respiratory depression, or even death. Toxicologists use the term "alcohol intoxication" to discriminate between alcohol and other toxins. Per Jeffrey A. Kraut in 2008, "in addition to metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure and neurologic disease can occur in some of the alcohol-related intoxications." Statistics show 33,870 admissions were for the toxic effects of alcohol types which are common in alcoholic drinks consumed in England during 2012/13. Per Harold S. Ballard's summary, "alcohol has numerous adverse effects on the various types of blood cells and their functions". 

With reference to Alex Goddard, graduate student, Neuroscience, Harvard Medical School, there is no significant harm when a left-handed (dominant) person is forced to write with their right (non-dominant) hand. 

Per David L. Post's Color in Electronic Displays, "visual acuity was not substantially affected by chromaticity, when given adequate contrast, photopic viewing conditions and reasonable symbol sizes. Conversely, acuity is not affected much by luminance contrast, given adequate chromatic contrast." For low vision observers Many low-vision observers prefer white-on-black text per Sloan 1977. Legge et al. in 1985 demonstrated that low-vision subjects with cloudy ocular media read faster with white-on-black text. This effect is probably due to abnormal light scatter in the eye. Upper-case is more legible than the other case styles, especially for visually-impaired readers, because smaller letter sizes can be used than with the other case styles, with no diminution of legibility and two other studies by Martha Ziefle suggest that one of the main contributors to slower reading performance, at least after 30 minutes, could be the resolution of the characters being read. For normal vision observers "Unfortunately, word readability is not necessarily simply related to letter identifiability and simple contrast measures". There has been several reported small advantages in normal reading performance for black-on-white text, especially for small letters. However, Legge et al. in 1986 found no systematic effect of contrast polarity in their study of the reading performance of subjects with normal vision since reading rates showed no effect of chromaticity at any of the character sizes studied. This experiment measured reading rates for monochrome text on CRT using a black background and either red, blue, green or white raster scan characters. Normal subjects usually read static text more rapidly. The reverse was true for low-vision subjects; their reading rates for drifting text were slightly higher (average 15%) than for static text. Most people with low vision are handicapped in reading and for many people, reading difficulty is the most serious consequence of eye disease. Per Shen Y et.al. in 2014, varying background luminance to maintain screen background luminance ratio is beneficial to human visual comfort.
