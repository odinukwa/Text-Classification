Genetics and physics are not mutually exclusive. Genetics is not magic; genes are just chemicals arranged in such a way that they induce cells to synthesize other chemicals (proteins) which then make the body do some things (hormones, enzimes), or get used themselves as building blocks (collagen, bone). If there's a physical mechanism to travel between worlds, it must involve physical means: some rearrangements of matter, some flows of energy. Chemical and physical laws working inside the bodies of living organisms (regulated ultimately by genes) are capable of notable things, such as turning light into energy and food, turning food back into energy, generating electrical currents of wildly varying strengths, etc. Suppose there's a means to travel between worlds using ordinary physics (physics that is ordinary in your universe). You don't have to specify what the mechanism is, but it must be attainable through reactions (matter-energy exchanges) that can plausibly occur inside a living organism. Make it so that those reactions only take place in very particular configurations of matter, which cannot be found in inanimate matter (it being too simple) and which only certain organisms have chanced upon through genetic mutation. In our universe we have something like that: it's called self-consciousness. It's just matter interacting with itself, yet as far as we know only humans have it. 

From the numbers you gave (planet and satellite of sizes comparable to Earth and Moon respectively, 7 years synodic month for the satellite) you cannot really infer the distance between the planet and the satellite and thence the magnitude of the tides. The Moon is currently about 384000 km from Earth on average and is tidally locked to Earth; for a mutual tidal lock to take place the Earth would have to decelerate its rotation and the Moon would have to recede a lot, a process that would take tens of billions of years. The Moon is obviously not on a geosynchronous orbit and as it recedes from Earth it will be even less so (if you take the value of today's GSO, of course!). As Earth's (or any planet's) rotation slows down due to tidal braking, the GSO will get farther from the planet. The distance between two mutually tidally locked bodies depends on the sum of their angular momentum, which cannot increase or decrease. You can start with any value within a broadly reasonable range. Angular momentum depends on mass and rotational speed, and a planet could conceivably end up with almost zero rotational speed after it has formed. On to your question: I would think that, irrespective of the magnitude of the tides, their extremely low frequency would make them almost unnoticeable. We're talking about an acceleration vector that takes seven years to go around an Earth-sized planet. 

You could circumvent problem number 1 by proposing that the story takes place in the very distant future. The main star your white dwarf would be companion of, therefore, won't be one of today's stars and might be among the last. The Stelliferous Era is supposed to last until 100 trillion years after the Big Bang. I don't see how you could go around problem number 2 without very serious astroengineering. 

Is this supposed to be realistic science-fiction, or can it be fantasy or handwavium-alloy science-fiction? In centuries past, natural philosophers tried to explain the biblical Flood using physical mechanisms (see for example Noah's Flood: The Genesis Story in Western Thought by Norman Cohn); what you're asking for is basically the same problem in reverse (there's too much water on Earth for it to disappear like that). One theory was that the Earth's interior was filled with large flooded caves which served as water reservoirs, which when perturbed somehow spilled their contents on the surface ("all the springs of the great deep burst forth", Gen. 7:11). If you're willing to go with Bible-based mythology "explained" in this way, you could reverse the mechanism and posit that great caves inside Earth's crust, which were empty so far, have just collapsed under the ocean floor, and most water has drained into them. Cue cataclysmic storms as millions of cubic kilometers of water are turned to steam. This is of course totally inconsistent with our current knowledge of Earth's geology, but yours doesn't have to be exactly our Earth. 

Tides follow the rotation of the affected body. In some places, due to the shape of the coast, the depth of the water and other factors, they can rise very fast, while in others they're barely noticeable. But tides cannot arbitrarily accelerate or slow down. Read up on tides on Earth; they're a very complicated phenomenon and many curious things are possible. 

The force of gravity exerted on an object on the surface of a planet is proportional to the mass of the planet and inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the object to the center of the planet. So, if you work with values relative to those of Earth, you can forget about difficult units and large numbers. $$ g = {M \over r^2} $$ where $M$ = mass of the planet, expressed in Earth masses; and $r$ = radius of the planet, expressed in Earth radii. Of course $g$, the gravity, will also be expressed in Earth gravities. For example, a Super-Earth that is 1.2 times the size of Earth and with 1.8 times its mass will have a surface gravity of $$ g = {1.8 \over 1.2^2} = {1.8 \over 1.44} = 1.25 $$ The actual value will be 1.25 times Earth gravity, i. e. $$ g = 1.25 \times 9.8\space m / s^2 = 12.25\space m / s^2$$ Note that mass and radius are not independent. If your planet is larger than Earth but has the same mass, then it must have a lower density, but a Super-Earth (a large rocky planet) cannot be a lot less dense than Earth. Oceans on Earth make no significant difference on the mass of the planet. In any case, an ocean is not made of special stuff; water (and ice) only add to the overall mass of the planet. 

The bombardier beetle: about 500 species of beetles of the Carabidae family are known to repel predators by means of a hot chemical spray. 

In principle you've answered your own question. Gravity inside a hollow sphere is always zero. More formally, the force exerted on any particle inside a hollow sphere, as a result of a uniform field that follows an inverse square law (gravity and electrostatic charge are two examples) is zero. This is the shell theorem. Now the shell theorem applies to perfectly symmetrical hollow spheres. A hollow Earth need not be perfectly symmetrical. If the hollow Earth is oblate (like our own), or otherwise non-symmetrical (either on the outside or the inside), then the gravity field will not be uniform and not always zero everywhere. For this to be noticeable, though, the asymmetry would have to be rather large (unlike Earth's). I have no idea how the math would work in that case, and also no idea whether that idea has ever been employed in fiction. 

Trees exist because, once a species of plant starts going up from the ground until it reaches a certain average height, it will have an advantage over other species, because it will be able to overshadow them and thus catch more light and deprive its competition of it. Individuals of the same species which have the capacity to grow a bit taller than average will, ceteris paribus, be selected for. So there's an evolutionary pressure to grow as tall as possible. For trees on Earth the theoretical limit of vertical growth is between 122 and 130 m (Earth's actual tallest tree is 115.8 m tall). This is given by how much energy it takes to take water up from the roots to the tallest leaves and the pressure that the tissues can sustain. In a planet with less gravity, trees could and would surely grow taller. They would also have to support their own weight, of course, so they would be as hard and solid as Earth trees. Plant life in jungles and forests organizes itself into levels, from the undergrowth to the tallest trees, and that would probably happen in your planet as well. Maybe, since trees would grow so much taller, there could be more, and more diverse, ecological levels. 

As for the method, it could be any suitable type of radiation, I guess, like focused coherent light (a laser), or pyrotechnics such as thermite. 

Tidal locking tends to circularize orbits. It is possible for tidally-locked objects to have somewhat eccentric orbits, but not forever unless other factors intervene. I guess our Moon (eccentricity: 0.0549) has not had its orbit circularized yet because 1) it's very large, 2) it's comparatively far from Earth, 3) Earth is not so large. Io, the innermost of Jupiter's Galilean moons, is tidally locked with an eccentricity of 0.0041, which doesn't go to zero because Io is in a double resonance with two outer moons which keep pulling on it. That kind of eccentricity is useless for your purposes. Maybe you could consider a spin-orbit resonance different from 1:1? Mercury is tidally locked with the Sun in a 3:2 resonance. It rotates three times every two orbits, and it has a very eccentric orbit (0.206). It's 50% farther from the Sun at aphelion than at perihelion. That's a lot less energy from the Sun. 

A body the size of Callisto with a surface gravity equal to Earth's would have to have an average density of 14.57 g/cm³. Since gravity at a given distance from a body of a given mass is proportional to the mass and inversely proportional to the square of the distance, the mass of your Callisto-sized planet must be $$M = { M_E \times \left(r_C \over r_E \right)² } = 8.548 \times 10^{23} kg$$ where $M_E$ = mass of Earth, $r_C$ = mean radius of Callisto (2410 km) and $r_E$ = mean radius of Earth. That gives about a seventh of Earth's mass, because anything on the surface of your planet will be much closer to its center than anything on the surface of Earth. The density of your planet can then be calculated by dividing its mass by its volume (which is the volume of Callisto). If you don't want to introduce any more parameters you can calculate the volume using the radius, which after some simplification gives $$D = { {3 M_E} \over {4 \pi \times r_C \times {r_E}²} } = 14.57 g/cm³$$ That's about three times the average density of Earth, or twice the density of iron, or a bit more than the density of mercury. I don't think a planet like that could form naturally in any way, but even if that were no problem, its chemical composition would probably preclude the existence of anything like plate techtonics or any of the common geochemical cycles that we know. I would suggest allowing for a much smaller gravity and a bit larger size, but in that case you might as well go and make your planet a clone of Mars. If you cut the gravity by half (by reference, Mars gravity is 1/3 of Earth's) you could have a "cannonball" planet made almost entirely of iron and other heavy metals, with a very thin lighter crust and mantle; I'm no geologist so whether this would work I cannot say. As for the satellite: you can have anything you want, really, if your model is an existing natural satellite. Just bear in mind that two bodies of similar sizes orbiting close to each other will raise mutual tides and will probably become tide-locked in a short span of time.
