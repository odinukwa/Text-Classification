There are some key features I'm thinking the throw bag rescue rope setup has, and most are replicable. I'm just not sure how to replicate some of the features. Features making throw bags so valuable: 

Remote, private land with no 'improvements'. Dirt road access up to a small field with a campfire, stream down a hill nearby, surrounded by vast woodland. A group of ~20 people gathering on site from different directions will have 3 to 5 meals together. Individuals or smaller groups will bring their own food. A single person or group is responsible for the kitchen supplies, in terms of cooking and cleanup equipment. This includes hand washing needs. What are the necessary kitchen supplies to accommodate a group (essentially car camping) in the woods? If this answer can be general enough to apply to group camping in a variety of settings that would be nice. I'm not looking for a specific camp-kitchen item to buy online, I'm looking for general items needed like "2 bins for stream water, 1 water container with spout for hand washing, biodegradable soap..." Emphasis on hygiene and safety. 

How do you smelt and forge iron sources from & in the wilderness? People must have started somewhere with this sort of thing! I once saw a video from a primitive technology practitioner on YouTube who smelted iron from a orange bacterial build up in water that served as the ore, using a wildcrafted furnace he made. He noted it was mainly a demonstration of a wildcrafted furnace and that larger furnaces would be built using more charcoal and labor to produce usable quantities of iron. He did not take next steps once he had iron pellets. What would one do with them (or more of them) to make the iron pellets into something useful, such as a nail, a needle, a knife, or an arrowhead? What are ways to process iron in the wilderness? Since this probably varies geographically, let's focus on common ways that are most widely applicable, and let's assume that we have only wildcrafted tools. 

Wipe up the mess using handkerchiefs instead of towels. I carry an excessive amount of cotton bandanas to serve as handkerchiefs. It's a relief to have enough clean ones to comfortably wipe your face, blow your noes, whatever you need a quick wipe for. They can also be multi-purpose (and the fact that bandanas come in many colors makes it easy to color code them for different purposes, e.g. so you're not dressing a wound with a snot-rag). One purpose they can serve is as a napkin for eating, or in this case more like a paper towel to clean up a mess. Forest floor duff can also serve as a paper towel to clean up a mess - it leaves (or should I say leafs) its own mess behind, but duff is potentially a much more hygienic mess than whatever it wiped up. Do whatever easy cleaning you can do of contaminated gear - such as wiping the vomit-covered bundle of bandanas you may have in a bunch of leafs - then store it safely and separately until you can do a better cleaning. For this purpose, having many lightweight bags proves immensely useful. I'm not sure what an old-day equivalent of this is, but having a bunch of zip-lock bags, grocery bags, and larger garbage bags folded up in your pack can serve many different purposes. From poncho to tarp to a sack to seal up something nasty away from everything else next to it in your pack - a good garbage bag can serve a similar purpose as the back of your car did. Now that your mess is mostly cleaned and contained, you can continue onward. Eventually you need to clean the mess you've contained though. In some treks, the bag of nasty bandanas can wait for a slop sink and washing machine at home. In other cases, due to extended time in the wilderness or due to the importance of contaminated gear (like a sleeping bag you couldn't totally clean and have been carrying in a garbage bag for a day or two), you'll need to have a cleaning session in the field. I find this to be a pain but it is doable and you should be prepared to do it if need be. Having soap (suitable for trekking in its versatility and environmental friendliness), something to scrub with (could even be forest floor duff), something to hang things up with (e.g. rope), and a way to carry water is important (for water, a 1L bottle might do, but a folding bucket, large pouch, or tarp to serve as a slop sink makes this much easier). Away from surface water (preferably 30+ meters) but close enough to have a water source, do plenty of rinsing of your gear, scrubbing and soaping as needed to clean it off. Hang your washed gear up to dry a bit. If the gear or weather isn't conducive to drying easily, then be extra careful in your rinsing to only wet what you need to. To make all this easier, plan on more time than you expect for this process, as being in a rush about this will add stress and not help any of the situation. 

It does depend on the circumstances and the other two answers cover it pretty well. A personal experience to back those answers up: I found myself sleeping in a precarious place after a rain storm which drenched just about all my gear - I was unprepared and did not have a dry bag of spare clothes. Overnight I hung up clothes to dry as well as they could, but weather and location didn't help much. In the morning, with my gear still wet, I rung out my pants and socks as much as I could before putting them on, then put on my outer shell which was still wet but provided wind protection. Before I did all this, I jumped around a bit to get my blood flowing - my sleeping bag was mostly dry but I was soaked and cold getting into it, so I had little warmth to start with and some exercise helped generate some. Expending energy was not a major concern because I just had a few miles to hike back to civilization. On the hike back I was extremely uncomfortable with the cold, wet outer shell against my cold skin. Dry clothing in between would have been immensely useful. Still, I noticed that when I took off the outer shell, exposure to the cold wind was far more bone chilling. I kept the shell on and walked back. In this case, protection from the cold wind was precious, even if it meant wet clothing which would suck some heat off of me. If wind was not an issue, the wetness of clothing sucking heat off of me might be worse than exposed skin I could keep warm with exercise. Even then, I'd be quicker to remove a wet cotton shirt than a wet fleece, and that depends on how wet the clothes are and how insulating the clothing is when wet. It is critical to have a dry bag for a spare clothes that never get wet unless as the literally last resort - better to wander about naked and have dry clothes to maintain your body heat in overnight if possible. 

Adapted from my answer to Correct breathing while bouldering with slight modifications for dealing with differences between bouldering (more stop-and-go, brief high intensity moves) and high inclination hiking (more steadily challenging, with longer stops when one does take a break). 

There are some visual cues you can look for - the color of the ice, signs of cracking or slush (or lack-thereof): 

This routine of controlled excitation then relaxation is used by professional athletes (and was mentioned in a TGO.SE Q&A about scuba) as a way to develop more control over your breath, greater lung capacity, and importantly, more relaxed breathing during times of stress and exercise. As this aids in the performance of martial artists, yoga practitioners, and olympic athletes, I think it will also aid you in climbing. 

I have a short camping trip coming up. This week, from using a wooden tool, I got blisters on my hands at the base of some fingers. In the future, ideally, I would take precaution to not get blisters before a camping trip. Alas, I have them, now what can I do? During the trip I expect to cut wood with axe & saw, keep a fire, and work with ropes setting up, moving around, and breaking down camp. I'm not worried about this trip as it's so short and the blisters aren't that bad to begin with. It does make me wonder though, if I have blisters and know I'll be potentially making them much worse, what are the best things I can do in between to heal and prep these spots for more friction? Wearing light work gloves in the first place or at camp is an obvious answer but are there other methods to treat the blisters directly? 

I agree with fgysin's answer (no - water is very important - even with that equipment, you still need to find water, avoid chemical pollution, and access larger quantities of water for camp chores). I also want to add: Redundancy. "Two is one and one is none" sounds silly until something breaks or is lost, and then you realize where that phrase comes from. If you only have one means of water purification and something goes wrong with it, you'll be very thirsty or drinking straight out of streams or bush-crafting some sort of container/filter (which isn't practical for a weekend hike, but you do need water on a weekend hike). Versatility: An easy way to secure redundancy while also covering more necessary bases at once. You ask if a filtration device can replace water you'd normally carry, assuming there will be water 'stored' in nature and available for you to filter & enjoy. Having water storage is highly practical if not outright necessary. A canteen with a steel cup provides 2 water storage options, and at least one water purification option (boiling in steel cup). Staying hydrated has a cascade of positive effects, and the opposite is true too (dehydration leads downhill fast). Having that convenient filtration device is good, but you shouldn't risk hydration by relying solely on that. See for yourself: I recommend taking the lifestraw while also bringing a canteen you could fill, and try using the lifestraw as your primary/only water device to see how it works for you. It's worth challenging yourself as a learning experience - just be careful as water is key!
