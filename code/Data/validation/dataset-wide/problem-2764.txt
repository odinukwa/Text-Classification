The fact that you can't apply concept of emptiness to the object doesn't make object non-empty. It could be just irrelevant to the concept. This is weird treatment of concept of emptiness either. Emptiness (in the most general definition) is the absence of (usually false) knowledge in the true knowledge. And in particular, absence of atman in the dharmas (skandhas, etc). One of justifications of some dharmas being empty is that they are dependently originated. But some other dharmas are still empty without being dependently originated, like nirodha or tathata. So one supposedly non-empty thing is atman, but it doesn't exists, as it's false concept. 

Free will is already misattributed to Self. Thus, destruction of wrong concept of Self does not affect free-will at all. 

Good effects such as good popularity, high social status, good regard, intelligence, from buddhist point of view, is result of previous good (in buddhist sense) conduct. So if you want to achieve such qualities in future or also have them in next births you should live and act propely (in buddhist sense again), be generous, don't harm other beings, study dharma (meditate, develop wisdom and other required mind qualities). Of course to have such goal is samsaric type of wholesomeness, which is normal in buddhism. But buddhism also provide higher type of goal - enlightenment. Buddhism have some straightforwardiness in it. Like if you want to be regarded as honest person - be honest person. But priority of being honest is (much) higher than being regarded as honest. Being honest also conductive to other good effects and development of mind. Even if buddhist, for example, is slandered without apparent reason, he/she should regard is as result of wrong conduct in previous lifes. 

On a conventional level, it's Person. On phenomenological level, 'who' is not a question, if there is no Self as phenomenon. There will be will, which is characterized as being free, and which is worked out by other consciousness phenomena. 

Buddha in BrahmajƒÅla Sutta didn't say there there is four alternatives about World's finiteness, he says that some recluses and brahmins have have such and such opinions. Difference is, that Buddha describes other's opinions, and not stating his opinion. In this tetralemma position is nothing particularly Buddhist, this is just Indian logic at the time (see Catuskoti). Why it's fourfold and not twofold (as is usual in A and ~A). Because, it is logic of natural language and not formal logic. In formal logic we have rule of identity to be also represented in language, so we can state that what is written as A is always meant as A (and vice versa), so there is only ~A possible as alternative (in formal writings). In natural language, we don't have such important convention, so it is possible to write that thing is A (in some sense), and in same time not A (in other sense), where sense of such writing should be derived implicitly. Non-formal writing would look contradictory if we miss context (i.e. if we misinterpret it). As a consequence, there is four alternatives instead of two to cover all possible 'syntax'. 

Sometimes in physics, the mathematics leads to "un-physical solutions or terms", that are readily tossed by the physicist. For example, when deriving absorption and emission rates for via quantized light-atom interactions in quantum optics class, we toss out 2 terms from the Hamiltonian, on the grounds that they don't correspond to any observed physical process: 

How should we understand what is going on here from an epistemological point of view? It feels a bit convenient to toss these 2 terms from the point of view of mathematics - well maybe even wrong, in the sense that the resulting Hamiltonian is no longer the result of a sound mathematical derivation? Would it be desirable for the physicist to work with maths that would not yield unphysical solutions? Isn't maths in fact unreasonably ineffective in physics? 

Here is a basic working definition of a law of physics from the point of view of a physicist. It does lead to several interesting philosophical questions, which I completely ignore (but am very well aware of). A law of physics is a provisional statement of an observed regularity in Nature. We formulate laws of physics to understand the world around us, and also to control it or act in it (not always: a good deal of astronomy for example deals with things that we will never control). A law of physics summarizes many instances of a given phenomenon in a convenient manner. For example, the law of gravitation summarizes in one formula how objects fall towards the ground as well as how planets go around the Sun. An observed regularity is something that holds in many, most or all observed instances of a phenomenon. A law is always provisional in the sense that a more encompassing or more precise statement of a regularity may have to be made later, given more observations. The laws of physics are usually numerical, holding between observable quantities that can be measured, so that the laws take a precise, mathematical form. However, there can be individual instances of measurements that do not exactly conform to the mathematical law at hand: there can be errors due to the measurement equipment or procedure, or fundamental uncertainty as in the case of quantum mechanics. This gives a statistical character to the laws of physics, and it is usually required to estimate the uncertainty in the measurements. A very basic example, but one that is IMHO worthwhile keeping in mind as a good image of a law of physics, would be the following picture, where we have observed a number of data points, and plotted the line (model/law) that bests fits these observations. It shows what the law/model is: the line, i.e. 2 coefficients a and b in a formula y = ax + b. This line summarizes the data points, it is the regularity/invariant underlying the phenomenon. It also allows interpolation and prediction to calculate unmeasured values of y for values of x. Finally, it shows the notion of error in measurement, as many actual points lie close to the line, but not exactly on it. 

In absence of Self, free will could be separate phenomenon in itself. It's act of free-will to have free will. (Sort of like adverbialism.) And let's define free-will phenomenon further, as will which is intentional (as opposed to involuntary or unconscious act). This will is caused by other phenomena to arise. 

Fictional is what not correspond to reality. It could be completely fictional (Buddhist example is atman), or just mistaken thinking about reality (Buddhist example is pratityasamutpada). Latter one could also have cause and effects, for example, if we imagine in deterministic way. Deterministic imagination could be very strong and causal to us (impossible to imagine differently, in more pleasant way), even though it's still imagination. Thus, if we imagine about real entities which have capacities, we could also imagine (or even conclude that) our imaginations as having capacities. 

So beautiful material objects (of five senses) are 'strings of sensuality' (kamaguna). While they are certainly considered dangerous they are not in itself bad. (Also, seeing them could be results of good karma.) What is bad is to have passion for them (kamaraga). 

Person. As long as person's will is not suppressed she is free willing. Action itself. Any voluntary, conscious action is free-willed. (And action could be blamed or praised.) By causality action will bring consequences as type of responsibility. And on deeper level, conscious attitude towards action. (Consciousness which is arranged in a way to be supportive of producing wrong actions, is in same time supporting arising of consequences for such actions.) 

Why it does not permit so? Just assume electron can have both positions and voila, it's permitted. Logic does not say that if electron have position A it can not have position B (it does not know anything about electrons). It's you saying that. If we put not valid propositions into logical inference it will produce not valid conclusion. It is not guilt of logic, because logic is method for avoiding mistakes in inference. Logic warns you to take correct propositions before inferring, so, if you put object which can have two positions and then assume it could have only one, this is your fault, not of classical logic. If you can not construct mental object for which A=A is true, you can not put it into logical inference, because you breaking identity rule. Logic can not infer anything you would wish, it can only infer some valid things if you obey it's rules. Logic also does not vary. Why there is multiple Logics then? Because this is multiple formalizations of logic and not (variance) of logic itself. And finally, if A is bigger than B and B is bigger than C, is A bigger than C? When you know this is it empirical to you? 

Some individuals are more productive than others. It's entirely conceivable that behind the Rawlsian veil of ignorance, we might have agreed that those who are born with low productivity will be excused from work and supported by those with high productivity. This agreement has the flavor of an insurance contract. By examining the circumstances and prices at which people are (or are not) willing to sign on to real-world insurance contracts, we can make some quantitative estimates of what the typical person would have agreed to behind the veil. There is certainly a plausible argument that these behind-the-veil agreements should be enforced, on the grounds that we'd all have voluntarily signed on to them if it had been possible. Figuring out exactly what we'd have agreed to is the hard part, but there's a vast literature on this, beginning with James Mirrlees, whose insights were worth a Nobel prize. (Rawls did a lot of speculating on what we'd have agreed to, but unlike Mirrlees and many others, Rawls made, as far as I am aware, no plausible argument to supported his speculations.) 

Certainly in the context of some physical theories, it is possible to prove that some things are infinite. Given general relativity and given enough observations (say about the distribution of mass and the rate at which the Universe is expanding), one tell whether the Universe is or is not infinite. Of course, that determination depends on the ambient theory. But then, everything we know about everything depends on some ambient theory. I believe the sun exists because I have a theory that says there's some relationship between my perceptions and external reality. So to say that we can determine the volume of the Universe is no more or less dicy in principle than to say we can determine the existence of the sun. Different theories of physics might lead to different answers about the Universe's volume, but then different theories of perception lead to different answers about the existence of the sun. As long as you have a physical theory you're pretty comfortable with, it's perfectly conceivable that observations can prove that some things are infinite. 

If reducing mathematics to logic is the goal of logicism, what other conceptions of mathematics are there? 

So my question is why does Kant further say that Der arithmetische Satz ist also jederzeit synthetisch (Arithmetical propositions are therefore always synthetical): what is ganz au√üer in 5 + 7 = 12, if we see 12 as just a convenient short name for 5 + 7? 

If mathematics is concerned with deductive reasoning, and relies on logic to ensure the soundness of its derivations, if on the other hand, the derivations of mathematics, at least in a philosophical and modern view of the subject, start from arbitrary axioms, can mathematics be reduced to arbitrary axioms and logic? Note: arbitrary here means that mathematicians are a priori free to choose an initial set of axioms, as in e.g. Euclidean vs non-Euclidean geometries, that they are not constrained by observations of the natural world in the choice of axioms to derive theorems from. 

I am aware of two major modes of reasoning used for justification of belief: deductive and inductive. Whereas physics relies on induction, mathematics seems to rely exclusively on deductive inference, which ensures the soundness of its conclusions. Is that correct? Are there other modes of inference used in mathematics? Also, to be precise, what I am after here are the admissible modes of inference used for justification in the final product of mathematics, not the types of inferences mathematicians use in their daily work to generate mathematics. For inductive reasoning, what I have in mind here is what is explaining in this entry of the SEP. (if there is nothing in mathematics but deduction, mathematics is an extension of logic, and there is no other way to see the situation) 

Maybe we want meaning, but Nature doesn't give us meaning - it is arbitrary, uncontrollable... That would be very unsettling and anxiety provoking, and would compel us to create a meaning for ourselves in this world that doesn't offer any. So, through the experience of being in a meaningless world, we experience the need for meaning. 

I think you are conflating two different uses of the word "true". First, in any formal system there can be sentences that are true in some models and not in others. It simply makes no sense to ask whether those sentences are true in some purely abstract sense. By analogy, the statement "The house is painted green" is true of some houses and not true of others. There's no reason to think we should be able to assign a single truth value to such a statement, and no reason to want to. Second, it is sometimes (but not always) the case that we have a particular model in mind from the outset. So if we've all agreed in advance that the house we're talking about is the one located at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, DC, then it does make sense to ask about the truth value of a sentence like "The house is painted green", and there is no ambiguity about whether that sentence is true or false. In particular, when we about arithmetic, we usually (but not always) have one particular model in mind, namely the standard model of the natural numbers (i.e. the counting numbers that you learned about in kindergarten). Therefore, statements in, say, Peano arithmetic, are unambiguously true or false (as long as we all realize that we're focused on that one model). That notion of truth coincides with Tarski's more formal definition. We determine whether such statements are true or not by studying the natural numbers. There is no single "usual" formal system in play here, so I don't know what you mean by the "usual means" for discovering which sentences are true. Sometimes we use Peano arithmetic. Sometimes we use induction up to epsilon-nought. Sometimes we use Grothendieck universes. Therefore, in response to your questions: When we talk about arithmetic, there is no "usual means" for determining what's true and therefore no need to develop "unusual means". Moreover, it would certainly be way counterproductive to adopt as system of multiple truth values when every sentence we can state is already either unambiguously true or unambiguously false.
