Marshall Hall and James Senior published a book The Groups of order 2n (n <= 6) in the 1960's. It's in the common room in the math department here at UCSB. Using rather obscure notation it arranges the conjugacy classes into lattices. Online you can find a list of all groups of order 64. 

In Polynomials, meanders, and paths in the lattice of noncrossing partitions, they talk about sequences of non-crossing matchings related by "flips". Savitt counts "maximal chains of 2-divisible noncrossing partitions to the set of necklaces" and there seems to be some relation to parking functions. What do these bijections look like? 

The 2-variable polynomial equation $f(z,t) = 0$ with $z = \mathbb{C}, \\,t \in \mathbb{S^1}$ has $n = \mathrm{deg}_z f$ solutions each fixed $t$. I wanted to follow the roots as they travel with time paramter $t$ and count the number of distinct orbits. Is there a procedure for this? Example: $f(z,t) = z^3 t^2 + z^2 t + z t^3 + z$ as our "time" parameter moves in a circle, the roots follow 2 distinct orbits. Here, $t \in \{ 0.9 e^{i \theta}: \theta \in [0, 2 \pi] \} = 0.9 S^1 \subset \mathbb{C}$ This defines a closed path in the configuration space of three points in the complex plane, i.e. a braid. My plot is a projection of this braid, forgetting the crossings. Looks like an circle + trefoil (not linked). 

Please consider Elkies The Klein Quartic in Number Theory and in general the book The Eightfold Way is online. In the translation of Klein's original work we find this futuristic image: 

Beenker's original paper Algebraic theory of non-periodic tilings of the plane by two simple building blocks : a square and a rhombus is online. And he shows you how to use the tetragrid to build the squares and rhombuses one by one. 

Every positive integer can be written as the sum of 4 squares $n = a_1^2 + a_2^2 + a_3^2 + a_4^2$ however, if we only allow sum of 3 squares some numbers have to be left out: 

Then to show such a path exists in the first place. In the dual graph you get a lamination of the disk. Contract all the inner "stuff" to a point. The boundary is divided into two arcs colored black or white and the an the innermost region must touch two points of the same color. The only exception is when there's a from one pt on the black-white boundary to the other. I can try to draw a graphic of this... the connected regions must have interesting shapes within the graph of diagonals as well. 

Asymptotically any polynomial is $p(z) = z^n + O(z^{n-1})$. Therefore $\mathrm{Re}[p(z)]= r^n \cos(2\pi i \theta)$ which vanishes at $\theta = \frac{(k+ \frac{1}{2})\pi}{n}$. Those $2n$ line segments need to connect in some fashion giving a non-crossing. Conversely, can we construct at $p(z)$ realizing any non-crossing matching? 

To prove equidistribution, you show the average value $e^{ i n \alpha }$ as 0 < n < N approaches 0 as N gets large. If you move around a circle enough, it's kinda of intuitive that your average location is in the center. With these nilmanifolds (which the circle S1 is also an example) you can get equidistribution for "bracket polynomials" like $\alpha n \lfloor \beta n \rfloor $ mod 1. What are the analogues of the Fourier coefficients here? 

I am missing some steps in the final derivation of a probabilistic computation of the even values of $\zeta$. They show the Cauchy distribution is relate to a certian Levy process: $$ |\mathbb{C}_1| \stackrel{\text{law}}{=} e^{\frac{\pi}{2} \hat{C}_1} \text{ with }\mathbb{E}\left[ e^{i\lambda \hat{C}_1} \right] = \frac{1}{\cosh \lambda} $$ If $X_t$ and $Y_t$ be $\mathbb{R}$-valued Brownian motions, then we have a $\mathbb{C}$-valued Brownian motion. $$ Z_t = X_t + i Y_t \text{ with }Z_0 = 1+0i$$ If we switch to polar coordinates, there is a "time-change" such that it is still Brownian motion, e.g. by conformal invariance of Brownian motion, as discussed in these early chapters in SLE. 

The Cannon-Thurston construction seems a little more delicate. In the first paper, near Theorem 5.7 we get 

The conjugacy classes of $S_n$ are the cycle types since if $\tau = (\dots)(\dots)\dots(\dots)$, the conjugation $\tau \mapsto \sigma \tau \sigma^{-1}$ permutes the labels in the cycles of $\tau$. Has anyone studied pairs of permutations up to simultaneous conjugation $(\tau_1,\tau_2) \mapsto (\sigma \tau_1 \sigma^{-1}, \sigma \tau_2 \sigma^{-1})$? These are related to branched covers of a once-punctured torus since $\pi_1(\mathbb{T}-\{ pt\}) = \langle a,b| \text{ no relations }\rangle = \mathbb{F}_2$ we need two generators, $\tau_1, \tau_2$. 

wasn't there Leray ? i have it oversimplified to: he was in jail when he discovered sheaves. Wikipedia has more detail: $URL$ 

I am sort of an armchair mathematician these days, but I suspect the answer to your first question is "no". At least in the literature categorification of Khovanov homology I have seen many instances of, Floer homology in general I know much less about. There are just so many: 

How about re-writing with Cauchy Residue formula? $$ \alpha_n(x) = \frac{(2n+1)!}{2\pi i} \oint \frac{dz}{z^{2n+2}}\cdot \frac{\sinh z }{\cosh z -1 + x} $$ Not sure how it helps you find roots or establish they are real. 

I have been reading about the divisor function $\sigma = 1 \ast 1$ and proved an elementary identity: $$ \Big[\sum_{d|n} \sigma_0(d)\Big]^2 = \sum_{d|n} \sigma_0(d)^3$$ Here $\sigma_0 = \sum_{d|n} 1$ counts the divisors of $n$. Could be the first of many such kind of identity? I wouldn't even be sure where to look for identities for $\sigma_k$. 

They are Hermitan matrices: $M = \overline{M}^\dagger$ (equal to it's own adjoint) with elements $\xi_{ij}$ chosen under special conditions: 

I've been reading some wonderful blog entries where Terry Tao and Ben Green prove some generalizations of Weyl Equidstribution using a "higher" Fourier Analysis. Unfortunately, all the information I can find about nilmanifolds is embedded for some difficult papers (at least for non-Harmonic analysts. also this one). 

Just some suggestions: I am concerned you are talking about parameterization (as would be the natural thing in an engineering problem) rather than the intrinsic geometry of the curve itself (as a geometer should). 

One example is the Kronig-Penny potential in solid state physics: $$ V(x) = V_0 \sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} \delta(x - an) $$ This potential is invariant under translations $x \mapsto x + a$ and therefore we guess $\psi(x+a) = \psi(x) e^{ika}$ for the wavefunction. Then we get a relationship between the lattice momentum and the energy: $$ \cos \lambda = \frac{v}{2\beta} \sin \eta + \cos \beta $$ with $\lambda = ka$ and $\beta = a \sqrt{\tfrac{2mE}{\hbar}}$ and $V = \tfrac{2mV_0 a}{\hbar^2}$ (these are just formulas taken from the link). 

Here is a partial answer: Dimer Models (as a special case of the Ising Model) are an example of complex structures on surfaces. If you arrange an octagon and identify the opposing sides, the surface has genus 2 (with two special points) and then overlay a grid and we can count the number of dimer tilings. And that will depend on the arf invariant of the surface. 

Using the Cauchy formula, it's possible to write these truncated exponential series as an integral: $$ (ez)^{-n} p_{n-1}(nz) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{\{|s|=1\}} \frac{s^{-n} \, e^{n(s-1)}}{s-z} \, ds$$ The exponential polynomials are in fact moments of a distribution. 

Here are the sources I have looked up. And I recognize that moduli space, it is the moduli space of $n$ marked points on the sphere. Or as I like to think of them as polyhedra (hopefully that is accurate). The second diagram counts how many Feynman diagrams - which is like a zillion. 

I don't even know where to begin. There's a discussion of stacks and they talk about $\mathrm{Bun}(G)$. I don't know what it is, or what it's elements are or why it is important. Google and wikipedia don't really help since they pre-suppose. One resource says $\mathrm{Bun}(G)$ is the moduli stack of $G$-bundles where $G$ is an affine algebraic group over a field $k$. 

The statement (taken from Montgomery-Vaughan) is actually really elaborate and I have many questions, but to fit the MO format, I'll ask just one. In my mind, I am linking these results to the Tauberian Theorems one finds in a good Complex Analysis textbook. The proof of this theorem seems to rest on two lemmas. First, a Laplace transform identity: $$ \mathcal{L}: e^u \to \frac{1}{s-1} $$ I think that just says: $\int_0^\infty e^{-u(1-s)} \, du = \frac{1}{s-1}$ but the main point is when we have $$\sum \Lambda(n) n^{-s} = \frac{1}{s-1} + O(...)$$ that pole gets turned into an exponential main term, and we are left bounding the noise term - potentially larger than the main term itself! 

You might wish to look at some papers by Paul Zinn-Justin. For example "Littlewood--Richardson coefficients and integrable tilings" defines a model of random tilings which count the Littlewood-Richardson coefficients. As early as 2001, puzzles were being used to compute the cohomology of complex Grassmanians. See "The honeycomb model of GL(n) tensor products II: Puzzles determine facets of the Littlewood-Richardson cone" by Allen Knutson and Terry Tao. Another might try looking in relation to the Temperley Lieb-Algebra or other Planar Algebras. 

I am trying to understand a bit of Milnor's paper "Algebraic K-Theory and Quadratic Forms". I guess, first things first. Why did Milnor come up with such an invariant? For any number field (such as $F = \mathbb{Q}$), he defines $K_n F$ as related to the group: 

I know that the function $ \frac{1}{1 - z \overline{z}}$ is the reproducing kernel for the Hardy space $H^2(\mathbb{D})$ -- the Szego kernel. I could imagine trying to solve the system of equations: $$ \begin{array}[ccccc] ff(z) &=& a_0 + a_1 z + \dots + a_n z^n + \dots &=& w \\ &\dots & \\ f(z) &=& a_0 + a_1 z + \dots + a_n z^n + \dots &=& w \end{array}$$ and hopefully this matrix occurs somehow. Instead of generalizing to other kernels, I would like to know why this condition is symmetric in $z$ and $w$, especially since $f(z)$ is not generally invertible but should have many branch points. And I don't really undrestand why positive-definiteness and boundness are equivalent in the first place. Thanks 

The only definition of a quantum group I know of involves q-deforming the relation $EF-FE=H$ or for SL(2): \[ \left[ \left( \begin{array}{cc} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \end{array} \right), \left( \begin{array}{cc} 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 \end{array} \right) \right] = \left( \begin{array}{cr} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \end{array} \right) \] All the axioms I have seen are very confusing and don't help me with much. I also get the sense, these should be called 'quantum lie algebras' rather than quantum groups. And I never understood the point of co-commutativity. 

An alternating permutation of {1, ..., n} is one were π(1) > π(2) < π(3) > π(4) < ... For example: (24153) is an alternating permutation of length 5. If $E_n$ is the number of alternating permutations of length n, the $\sec x + \tan x = \sum_{n \geq 0} E_n \frac{x^n}{n!}$ is the exponential generating function. How does one sample the alternating permutations uniformly at random? Rejection sampling would quickly become inefficient since $\frac{E_n}{n!} \approx \frac{4}{\pi} \left(\frac{2}{\pi} \right)^n$ decays exponentially in n.
