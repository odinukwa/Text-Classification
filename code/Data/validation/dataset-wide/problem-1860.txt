in an aggressive tone (for me, and for other employees as well, as she exclaimed this in public) She sent a request to said employee to do task A, and the employee has indeed finished the task according to specifications. I read the request, and I confirmed that he did the job. The root of the issue, she said, is that he didn't do what she asked him to do exactly, basically, miscommunication. In an IT person's head, the job was done. I read it and interpreted it as such where he actually did the job correctly, when she actually meant something else. She has no IT experience (makes me wonder how she became a project manager in the first place, but that's for another topic), so she can't communicate very well with IT staff. What is the problem here, and what should I do? Is it the miscommunication? Her lack of IT knowledge? Or the badmouthing? Should I talk to my supervisor about this, and if so, how should I approach this? 

The situation : I'm the contracted web developer for my company (which isn't an IT company). They are using a legacy framework that almost nobody knows, has a very small community, and the general reviews on it are just plain bad. (makes me actually wonder why they picked it in the first place) In short, people with this skill are very few, and I'm the only one in this company with this job description. My contract ends soon and the company has offered me an extension. I was hoping to ask for a raise, stating several reasons, but on the back of my head, the main reason is because I know my company needs me and if they don't get me hired, their website won't be maintained. The question : Is the situation where one specific person knows that the company needs this specific person a reason worthy enough of a raise? 

Why not? I'm skeptical of that assertion unless there's an unusual time crunch. Using reference material only takes seconds. 

So four years of posting questions on Stack Overflow? My advice is put integrity first. Just being honest will take you further than anything you can write on a resume. Edit added: In comments, you have provided more information about another StackOverflow account (other than the one this is linked to) which seems to have credibility and significant reputation. If true, I suggest you can claim ample experience training or mentoring others via StackOverflow, and I would sell to that strength that while also working to fill the gap by actually building a demonstrable and substantial project. Someone with your skills should find it easy to put a project together in short time. Then when asked, you can say you are young and you are working on something amazing - it's in the works! Good luck. 

Sounds to me as though the CEO does believe what he's saying but doesn't want to force it on other manager(s). Best to have an open and honest discussion about it with your manager. Tell your manager how you feel, but ideally don't threaten to quit. Just go on an information finding mission for now. See how your manager feels about it, try to understand their position. If you hear that you need more experience, ask what areas specifically you can help with to gain that experience. 

I'm in quite of a bind here. Although this is unintentional, I've found myself in an awkward situation where I've been offered a job that I'm interested in while being on annual leave, and I'm not coming back for 1 more week. I'm currently overseas where coming back isn't an option unless I wait for my return flight which comes in a week. I don't exactly have the luxury of time to wait until next week to personally hand in my resignation letter, so I'm looking to do it by email. Is there anything I should be aware of? Anything ethics related, or when the notice period starts, and things I could do to smoothen the process? Thanks! 

Number 4 is the safest, however, I think I'd be spending more time as an unemployed man, and I want to minimize that as much as possible. What option would be best in terms of employer convenience and minimal unemployment time? 

Additional info : I'm planning to leave, in case I can't work under Y directly. So I guess that adds to my negotiating power. 

In my experience, as long as the wages are not insultingly low, what most people want from their employment is job satisfaction. They want a job that is intellectually or emotionally rewarding, one that allows them to do good work in a context where that work will be valued. Money usually becomes a primary motivator only when they are frustrated in those other desires. Certainly, the best colleagues and subordinates I've known have seen their employment in that way. If I found myself in negotiations with an employee who was focussed solely on money, I would worry that either we were failing to use him appropriately (which we could fix by a change of focus or team) or that he wasn't really interested in the work (which we could fix rather less sympathetically). I'm not saying I'd reject the possibility that we weren't paying him what the job was worth - sometimes these things do slip by from lack of attention. But I would be more wary than I would with an employee whose focus was on improving their job satisfaction. There are areas of work where money (and the desire for more of it) is expected to be the primary motivating factor (e.g. high finance). Are you in one of those? If not, do be aware that pure focus on financial reward is a little out of fashion at the moment, largely due to the economic consequences wreaked by those same sectors. Note: in response to the extended question from the OP, I've added some emphasis markup to the above to clarify, without changing any of the content. The original question asked why "I want more money" can have a negative connotation. So my answer seeks to explain the perception. It does not say that anybody should not aspire, nor that they should never ask for more money. 

Several resources indicate and suggest that you should not disclose your previous salaries in your past employments for the reason that there's a chance that the potential employer could "lowball" you and offer you a slightly higher salary compared to your previous, but a largely lower salary compared to their expected range. However, in the case of a history of a higher-than-average salary, should disclosing my previous salary be OK in terms of getting a higher salary? 

What are the advantages and disadvantages in inviting and accepting all people in your LinkedIn profile? Obviously the advantage is that you'd have a larger circle and you'd be easier to find for employers, but am I missing out on a disadvantage here? 

These outbursts are damaging the work environment and may emotionally affect the other employees. The work productivity is most probably affected, and as HR, it is your job to take action to keep your employees at their best possible shape to work productively for the company. You said you talked with him and I think that's great, but if it's still continuing, you have to devise other methods. Maybe he needs a short break from work to calm himself, or some other thing you can think of to improve his situation. But I believe action must be done, and it must be done fast. P.S. Take my advice with a grain of salt as I am no expert in these types of things. :)
