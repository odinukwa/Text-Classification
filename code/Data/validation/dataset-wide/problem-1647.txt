The note on legibility here is not hardly the focus of the section. While it does admit that poor handwriting plays a part in preventable ADEs, the brief alone does not provide enough reason for the Time article's comments that "Doctors' sloppy handwriting kills more than 7,000 people annually." Digging into the full report, I did find a few more notes on handwriting issues: 

But the question at heart is this: Did something or someone specific target Firefly for cancellation aside from the reasons that typically get shows cancelled? Or, more bluntly, did an executive actively sabotage the show (or Joss Whedon) in such a way that resulted in Firefly getting cancelled? 

[14] appears to be a study specifically focused on the "effect of a tight necktie on intraocular pressure". Aside from intraocular pressure issues, do neckties pose any health threat with regards to blood flow? 

This results in a minimum wage hike of 12.4% or $8.15/hr. Still not quite right. Unless Warren's suggestion has some other way for McDonald's to cope with the price increase, this still isn't very plausible. To run the numbers the other way, a minimum wage hike to $10.10 is a 39.3% increase: 

The number of preventable ADEs is extremely large. The report suggests that a typical hospital patient is subjected to at least one medication error a day. Different studies have claimed 380,000 and 450,000 preventable ADEs per year. The committee behind the report considers these low estimates. 

The source behind the Time article is a July 2006 report from the Institute of Medicine entitled Preventing Medication Errors: Quality Chasm Series. A brief (PDF) is available online and the information here is from that. The topic revolves around adverse drug events (ADEs) which includes errors caused by faulty prescriptions: 

This petition is the most authoritative claim I've seen on the subject and it makes me feel rather confident that Warren's claim is completely off-base. The menu price increase is over twice as high (1.25% instead of 0.6%) but the petition explicitly notes that this only covers half of the cost. They estimate the total cost would be 2.7 percent. To completely cover that cost with menu price increases, a $4.00 Big Mac would cost $4.10 and Warren's $7.19 combo meal would cost $7.38 — an increase of 19 cents. Although Warren is proposing a smaller minimum wage, her example also cuts the menu price increase in half and completely ignores the other half of the impact. While it is possible that Warren understands that her four cent suggestion is only covering half of the needed increase, the claim as represented in this question seems to have no hint of this extra requirement. It means the $10.10 minimum wage + 0.6% price increase is supposed to accomplish the same effect as a $10.50 minimum wage + 2.7% price increase. For those curious, the proposal linked to a more thorough document that reveals the source for all of their calculations (PDF warning). A quick snippet: 

The 1.5 million statistic does come from the IOM report but the 7,000 people killed is entirely unsourced. The Straight Dope comments: 

Warren's quick math implies that an entrée that costs twice as much now would still cost twice as much after an increase in minimum wage — this implies that it scales with entrée price. Where the specific four cents comes from is somewhat of a mystery but it amounts to a roughly 0.6% increase in retail price. (As an aside, it is clear is that this system is not completely accurate due to differing overhead costs on various entrées. The costs of producing a $7.19 entrée are not half of the costs of producing a $14.40 entrée. So a literal interpretation of adding a 0.6% increase to each meal wouldn't be strictly accurate. But I suspect Warren's point is that there is a buffer in the profit margin to fully absorb a wage increase.) This 0.6% increase is hotly contested and various other numbers have been suggested by articles that dig into the topic. BusinessWeek has this statement: 

WolframAlpha reveals that this solves at 0.042 or 4.2%. A minimum wage hike of 4.2 percent would be $7.55/hr. This means Warren is claiming that a $10.10 minimum wage is doing the work of $7.55/hr. It isn't even close. So let's be charitable to Warren and assume she knew this was only supposed to cover half of the extra costs. 

Rumors in my office abound that neckties are bad for your health. One manager often scoffs that "they even did studies" and that ties impair blood flow. Checking Wikipedia offers a few hints but the relevant parts undersourced: 

The article later concludes that the price increase would be 38%. Warren's suggestion of $10.10 would obviously have a much smaller impact than the $15 discussed above. The BusinessWeek article does address this briefly: 

A common assumption about household pets is that there is a mutual endearment between owner and pet. Searching the internet finds handfuls of people asking the same question and there are plenty of editorial comments on whether our fluffy friends love us back. To approach this from a skeptical standpoint, what emotional details do we know about animals? Have studies been done on emotional attachments of dogs to people? "Love" is a difficult term to pin down even with regards to human interaction but, for the sake of this question, here is a definition I pulled from the dictionary: 

The full article draws comparisons to new-age or alternative medicine and should be taken with a grain of salt. But other sources make similar suggestions, especially regarding maintaining low stress levels. Unfortunately, someone in a coma isn't likely to have any specific attitude, let alone one of a fighter. Here, we enter a collision of terms regarding personality, attitude, coma, unconsciousness. The general description of coma: 

And other similar comments can be quickly found. The basic gist seems to be that DRM is so easily bypassed by pirates that it may as well not be there. So, assuming that the purpose of DRM is to prevent pirating a game, does it work? 

I recently watched the film Phantoms. A scientist in the movie claimed that flatworms were able to "consume" memories from other flatworms. The specific example was that of learning the solution to a maze by digesting ground up flatworms that had already solved the maze. I don't understand how memories could possibly survive being ground up, let alone survive an entire digestive system, and be recreated from its parts. But a quick searching of the internet reveals other discussions on the topic including comments that someone actually conducted such an experiment. Here are two such articles: Example 1; Example 2. 

These percentages are arbitrary, but they provide a starting point. A clarification of the last question: If the female Bechdel test fails 75% but the male Bechdel test fails 25% of the time, the difference would be 50%. To help restrict the data set if a larger one is not practical, feel free to concentrate on extremely popular or critically acclaimed films from the previous decade (2000-2010). This, again, only serves to provide a starting point. (An alternative would be the decade surrounding the comic's printing: 1980-1990.) 

There was also a note about transcription errors which could be seen as a container for handwriting errors. One study labeled 29 of the 334 errors found as transcription errors. But nowhere in the report did I find an estimated death count for anything specifically targeting handwriting. Looking closer at the Time article, I realized it may have just been tricky writing:
