There is an oracle $A$ s.t. $\mathsf{P}^A = \mathsf{NP}^A$. The oracle normally used for the theorem is the set TQBF which is a $\mathsf{PSpace\text{-}complete}$ set. $\mathsf{PSpace} \subseteq \mathsf{P}^\mathsf{TQBF} \subseteq \mathsf{NP}^\mathsf{TQBF} \subseteq \mathsf{PSpace}^\mathsf{TQBF} \subseteq \mathsf{PSpace}$ All inclusions are clear, the last one follows from the fact that TQBF is in $\mathsf{PSpace}$ and you can replace the oracle for TQBF with the $\mathsf{PSpace}$ machine solving it and the resulting machine will be in $\mathsf{PSpace}$. 

In general you can pick any set of properties regarding the model theory of logics you are interested in and create an abstract theory about them. Most of these will not be interesting for various reasons but some will be. An example of nice class of model theoretic properties is those chosen for Abstract Elementary Classes. You may want to check John Baldwin's slides to get a feeling of the model theory that can be derived using such simple model theoretic axioms. 

A good book on the complexity of real constants and functions is Ker-I Ko's "Computational Complexity of Real Functions", 1991. 

I am looking for sentences in the language of first order arithmetic ($0,1,+,\cdot,\leq$) which are independent from $\Pi^0_2$ consequences of true arithmetic $\Pi^0_2\text{-}\mathsf{Th}(\mathbb{N})$. I want natural statements, e.g. statements that have been studied in number theory or combinatorics for their own sake. The motivation comes from looking for true statements that are not provable in $\mathsf{I}\Delta_0(L)$ where $L$ contains arbitrary fast growing (computable) functions. 

It is an open problem if there is an optimal propositional proof system. Therefore we don't know if ZFC as a propositional proof system is optimal either. ZFC as propositional proof system can p-simulate any propositional proof system whose soundness (if there is proof for a formula then the formula is true) as a propositional proof system is provable in ZFC. The trick (which I think is due to Steve Cook) is based on the fact that proofs are concrete finite objects, if there is a proof for a formula in a proof system, then ZFC can prove its existence (i.e. ZFC is $\Sigma_1$-complete), combining this with the provability of the soundness we derive the truth of the encoded formula in ZFC. The rest of the argument is translating this first order proof in ZFC to a propositional proof in ZFC as propositional proof system and proving the equivalence of a propositional formula with the formula itself in the proof system. This can be done in $\mathsf{TC^0}$-Frege and any system that contains it. See Logical Foundations of Proof Complexity, 2010 by Cook and Nguyen for the details. 

This is not an answer to the question intended by OP, but rather a philosophical meta-answer and might be interesting to some readers. The use of sign $\vdash$ is completely different from $\rightarrow$. You can not prove "$\varphi \vdash \psi$", since it is not a proposition. It is a speech-act, it is invented by Frege and has been discussed extensively in philosophy of mathematics and philosophy of language. This speech-act is called assertion and is composed of two separate parts "|" and "-". It is an act of judgment. For more details see this SEP article. This distinction between a proposition and a judgment is very important and essential for Martin-Lof's type theory and philosophy. In fact, from this viewpoint, $\varphi \vdash \psi$ is a common formal misuse because the assumptions cannot be before the speech-act. For this reason Martin-Lof prefers to write the assumptions of the assertion after the proposition in his type theories. For difference between $\vdash$ and $\rightarrow$ see this article. 

The continuous version of the problem has a well-known solution via Brouwer’s Fixed Point Theorem, but most proofs of Brouwer’s Fixed Point Theorem require algebraic topology. Even Sperner’s combinatorial proof requires some effort to understand. If, however, we can solve the combinatorial problem above, then by a limiting argument, we can solve the continuous version rather easily, thus avoiding Brouwer. There are certain similarities between this problem and the Game of Hex, where elementary properties of the game are a consequence of non-trivial topological arguments, as first demonstrated by John Nash. 

Suppose that the hypotheses on $ R $ in the second definition hold. Let $$ I_{A} \stackrel{\text{df}}{=} \{ a \in A \mid (a,0_{B}) \in R \} \quad \text{and} \quad I_{B} \stackrel{\text{df}}{=} \{ b \in B \mid (0_{A},b) \in R \}. $$ 

The proof that $ \Pi_{\mathscr{B}({L^{2}}(\mathbb{T})),U,V}: A_{\theta} \to {C^{*}}(U,V) $ is a $ * $-isomorphism follows from the non-trivial fact that $ A_{\theta} $ is a simple $ C^{*} $-algebra (i.e., it has no non-trivial closed proper two-sided ideals). The main idea behind the proof is to use the so-called trace function on $ A_{\theta} $. This trace function does wonders for us. Firstly, it shows that $ A_{\theta} $ contains a non-trivial projection element. Secondly, it shows that $ \mathcal{A}_{\theta} $ is faithfully represented as a $ \mathbb{C} $-algebra in $ A_{\theta} $, i.e., $ \mathcal{N} = \{ 0_{\mathcal{A}_{\theta}} \} $. Observe that in defining the $ C^{*} $-semi-norm $ \| \cdot \|_{0} $, there was no guarantee that each non-zero element of $ \mathcal{A}_{\theta} $ would not be sent by $ \| \cdot \|_{0} $ to $ 0 $. Playing around with the trace function shows that this is indeed the case. 

Let $ \mathcal{P} $ denote the free associative unital $ \mathbb{C} $-algebra in four indeterminates, $ u $, $ u^{*} $, $ v $ and $ v^{*} $, where the identity element of $ \mathcal{P} $ is denoted by $ \mathbf{1} $. Let $ \mathcal{I}_{\theta} $ denote the (not a priori proper) two-sided ideal $$ \left\langle u u^{*} - \mathbf{1}, u^{*} u - \mathbf{1}, v v^{*} - \mathbf{1}, v^{*} v - \mathbf{1}, u v - e^{2 \pi i \theta} v u \right\rangle. $$ Form the quotient $ \mathbb{C} $-algebra $ \mathcal{A}_{\theta} \stackrel{\text{df}}{=} \mathcal{P} / \mathcal{I}_{\theta} $. Let $ \dot{\mathbf{1}} $, $ \dot{u} $, $ \dot{u}^{*} $, $ \dot{v} $ and $ \dot{v}^{*} $ denote the images of $ \mathbf{1} $, $ u $, $ u^{*} $, $ v $ and $ v^{*} $ in $ \mathcal{A}_{\theta} $ respectively. Then the following monomials are distinct in $ \mathcal{A}_{\theta} $ and define a Hamel basis for it: $$ \dot{\mathbf{1}}, \quad \dot{u}^{m} \dot{v}^{n}, \quad \dot{u}^{m} (\dot{v}^{*})^{n}, \quad (\dot{u}^{*})^{m} \dot{v}^{n}, \quad (\dot{u}^{*})^{m} (\dot{v}^{*})^{n}; \qquad (m,n) \in \mathbb{N}_{0}^{2} \setminus \{ (0,0) \}. $$ As such, $ \mathcal{I}_{\theta} $ is a proper ideal of $ \mathcal{P} $, and so $ \mathcal{A}_{\theta} $ is a unital $ \mathbb{C} $-algebra. 

The reflection is similar to the property above with truth replaced with provability: let $\square$ denote the provability in theory $T'$. Then reflection property is: 

This is not an answer. Scott, I am trying to understand the difference between the two. Could you please explain the reason for BB being OK? It seems to me that the usual argument for existence of the values for BB should be provable in a very weak set theory. We form the set of halting TM with n states, prove that it is finite, and take the maximum of steps before halting for each of them. The reason we can not compute the values is the logical complexity of the formula defining BB, we could compute it if it was $\Sigma_1$, but it is not. Am I correct? I guess that the distinction is about the complexity of the formula defining the function. It seems that you are OK with arbitrary quantifiers over natural numbers but not over sets of them. For example, what would you say if we use GC in place of CH? So you are asking about arithmetical functions. What about BB for Turing machines with oracles in the arithmetical hierarchy? Is using higher order quantifiers over natural numbers OK? What if I define it to be the BB for functions defined by such formulas? I think the relation with truth predicate is that since you are OK with arithmetical formulas, you think they have definite truth values, but it seems that you don't think that formulas outside this hierarchy, e.g. those with set quantifiers over natural number necessary have definite truth values. 

IIRC, the circuit complexity classes like $\mathsf{AC^0}$ were studied originally for proving relativization results. A classical example is Furst, Saxe, and Sipser, "Parity, Circuits, and the Polynomial-Time Hierarchy". 

EDIT: I am mostly interested in the case that the paper is in your area and is not written by a crank but by a mathematician with previous publications in reputable journals (although not necessary in the same area or a related one). 

Provably total functions of an arithmetical theory is one of the tools used in proof theoretic analysis of theories. I am looking for early history of its development. In particular, 

This is studied in bounded reverse math by people like Fernando Ferreira and colleagues. The base theory BTFA [Fer'94] is a two sorted theory version of Sam Buss's bounded arithmetic theory $S^1_2(\alpha)$ [Bus85, ch. 9] plus bounded collection/replacement for $\Sigma^b_\infty $ formulas ($B\Sigma^b_\infty$) plus a form of comprehension axiom for $\Delta_1$ sets ($\nabla^b_1CA$): $$\forall x (\forall z \ \varphi(x,z) \leftrightarrow \exists y \ \psi(x,y)) \Rightarrow \exists Z \ \forall x \ (x \in Z \leftrightarrow \exists y \ \psi(x,y))$$ where $\varphi$ and $\psi$ are respectively $\Pi^b_1$ and $\Sigma^b_1$ formulas. This is a modification of Simpson's axiom in his book [Sim'09]. Because of its special form the first order part is conservative over $S^1_2$ and is incapable of using the full power of comprehension for $\Delta_1$ sets. On the other hand, the second order part of the smallest model of the theory is $\Delta_1$ sets. In [FF'02, thm. 4], a version of the Intermediate Value Theorem is proven in BTFA. Some caution is needed here in formalizing the IVT. Also the proof is not constructive (either there is a rational number which is the root of the function or we can continue a process getting arbitrary close to a root. Deciding that a given rational number is not a root of the function is not decidable and this is required since we need to stop the process of dividing the current interval into two halves if we reach a root, i.e. we need this assumption so we have $f(m)<0 \ \lor \ f(m)>0$ where $m$ is the rational mid-point of the current interval). As far as I remember WKL is not provable in BTFA. See also [FF'05] and [FF'08].
