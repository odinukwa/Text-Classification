Here are the hard and fast rules I was taught by my wilderness instructors before a 25 day pack hike across the Superstition Wilderness (desert) and Tonto National Forest (desert) that I have lived by for over the past 9 years. If you're healthy and don't suffer from any adverse conditions (like asthma) exercise should feel good (maybe difficult but still good). If you feel any sort of ache or pain, drink water. If you're in a bad mood, drink water. If you feel at all abnormal or there is anything wrong with you, drink water. You are made from water and water cures everything (within reason). Sip it so you don't waste it and don't take it for granted and you'll be alright. Also, don't forget your electrolytes. Even if you get them from munching on a few dehydrated banana chips. 

Not really... Aside from making workouts less monotonous, changing machines will also help you build different muscles. The main focus of a 'cardio' workout is heart/lungs so it doesn't really matter what type of exercise you do as long as it's the right intensity to kick your body into increased metabolism mode. A side effect of using different machines is, by working out more muscle groups you may also increase your caloric expenditure vs always using the same machine (Ie more muscles strength increases require more energy overall). But, that depends completely on what types of workouts you're doing and probably won't have a drastic effect overall. 

Up the intervals based on what you can handle. Based on how much you've done so far you should have a pretty good idea on how to gauge the intensity. Keep in mind that it won't be the same every day. You'll have good days and bad days. Listen to what your body tells you and adjust to compensate. It may also help to get a heart monitor so you can accurately measure the load the workout puts on your heart. HIIT is all about increasing your V02 MAX and anaerobic threshold (how effectively your body uses oxygen). Measuring and targeting your pace to specific heart ranges may be a better way to set your pace than arbitrary speed measurements. 

tl;dr - Starting to feel slight tendon pain. How long should I rest before it's OK to hit the gym hard again. Background: I recently decided to end my winter hibernation and got back into rock climbing. Regardless of my slightly sloppy physique I have been hitting the bouldering gym as hard as my body will allow. Meaning, I may do more than one session a day with a few hours in between but am careful to take rest days so I can take advantage of super-compensation. I'm being careful to warm-up properly by hitting an exercise bike and stretching before each climb session. Aside from a lot of expected soreness and energy dip until my body catches up to the pace I woke up today with some slight tendon pain in my right elbow (ie dominant arm) that subsided by lunch time. Concern: I'm making good progress so far but also take the correct steps to avoid injury. I can switch over to working cardio in the interim but the super-compensation has been working surprising well so far and I'm really motivated to get back in the gym as soon as possible. What's a good preventative rest interval after a minor tendon strain? Note: There was no inflammation, just slight localized pain. Probably similar to golfer's/tennis elbow. Update Thanks to the advice from DavidR. I started taking rest days a lot more seriously and implemented a strict 'one rest day following a climb day' rule. I also occasionally mix in some light extensor/flexor stretches during my climbing sessions. Now that my forearms are conditioned for the intensity, I rarely feel any tendon soreness unless I climb routes that include dynamic moves or a lot of really crimpy holds. Once my forearms got better and I could handle longer sessions I actually started to have shoulder pain instead. I dislocated my left shoulder when I was a teen so I have to be careful about straining it. With some basic rotator cuff exercises and ample rest days when it started to hurt the shoulder pain also subsided. I've been climbing 100% for a couple months now. 

Yes, most definitely. The time intervals you're using are short enough and the numbers you posted make it sound like you're doing very well so far. 

B vitamins are also important to eat after strenuous exercise. Especially B1 (thiamine) as a deficiency will cause sore muscles.

For more detailed information about sleep and how it directly affects our hormone balance can be found in this article. Basically, if you don't get enough sleep, your body won't be able to properly balance your hormones and your body will be all 'out-of-whack'. 

Here's what works for me Music If you don't have a taste for techno, develop one. The high BPM (135+) songs not only give you a beat to match; they also give you a rate of momentum to match so you can measure when you're starting to fall off. Try to sync into your own little world. One of the greatest barriers (at least for me) of working out is the social awkwardness of doing it alone. The better you're able to tune out the people around you the less anxiety you'll feel about doing activities by yourself. I use two different (and both very high quality) podcasts for workout music. Podrunner and Beatport Burners. Learn how to make snap decisions It may seem pretty rudimentary but the ability to make very quick precise decisions is a good skill to have when you need to step out of your comfort zone. Here's one strategy I've used to build this skill in the past. When you wake up in the morning (for work or school) instead of milling around in bed, immediately jump out of bed as if your house is on fire. The more time you spend dwelling on a decision the harder it is to make. Another would be to literally split the decision into two different options and flip a coin to decide. Instead of a lazy/active decision make it an active/active decision. For instance, instead of deciding whether or not to go workout, make it 'workout at the gym' or 'go for a run'. That way you have no path to laziness. The coin is only used as a crutch to get over the anxiety barrier involved in decision making. IMHO, contrary to popular belief, indecisiveness has very little to do with laziness and very much to do with anxiety. Many people are lazy simply because they're too afraid to break out of their comfort zone. The reward (benefit of getting out) has to be greater than the risk (fear/anxiety involved in the unknown of trying something new). Shaming yourself into believing that your just a 'lazy person' only makes it harder to become motivated because now you have to overcome both the anxiety of trying something new and the insecurity created by your self-image as a 'lazy person' (ie the risk increases). Imagine the different ways you can critique a person. First you can attack a person's actions (why don't you get off your butt and get outside), attack their traits (why are you being lazy), or attack their person (you are a lazy person). The first two are easy to change, the third... not so much because you're describing the essence of what that person represents, not their actions. Take this idea into consideration when you critique yourself. People have the singular ability to destroy their own self-esteem without any external interaction because of this. Learning how to separate the 'who I am' from the 'what I do sometimes' is an important skill to learn to prevent from any unnecessary confidence speed bumps. Adding an imaginary sense of danger is a means to increase the reward of getting out (escape from danger) whereas flipping a coin leaves the decision up to a higher power (luck, god, ect). I could probably write a dissertation about how religion relates to the higher power aspect of decision making but I'll spare you. Diet/Health A mental barrier is not always strictly mental. Sometimes, a lack of energy/motivation can be due to your diet/health. For instance: if you're not getting enough sleep your hormones are likely not balanced properly; if you overtrain, your body hasn't had enough time to properly recover yet; if you don't have enough energy you will feel like you don't have enough energy. The solutions to these issues are simple: get enough rest; plan enough recovery time in between workouts (if you start to feel a decrease of energy); and eat enough (carb load the night/morning before a day of high energy activity) and be sure to eat a lot of protein right after an activity (protein uptake is greatest <45min after exercise) for a better recovery.
