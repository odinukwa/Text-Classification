While the sutras are, like the Tripitaka, complete (despite having slowly been recovered after the Buddha's death), anyone can write a sastra, though that wouldn't make it canonical. 

An example would be: Adam tastes the apple Supposing this "taste" can be considered a kind of self, then if Adam sees smells touches feels nothing, just tastes the apple, there is "continuity" and he's still Adam. But as long as he does have other senses, and from moment to moment, the taste of apple doesn't make him who is he. I've never read any commentary which claims this is what the empirical self is in Buddhism, so would be really surprised that this counts as a categorical denial of substantial self. 

Because, taken literally, I feel that it is a very good way of looking at our relationship to history, when we cannot do anything about it. 

Which body of the Buddha belongs to the Buddha nature? I suppose all three, but I would be interested to hear otherwise. 

I think the answer to 2 is form feeling sensation, etc., and the answer to 1, what is put out when nirvana or final nirvana is reached, is conditioned existence, or maybe suffering, or dependent phenomena, or ignorance. It probably depends on your framework. 

I think I remember reading that the an unborn child or fetus exemplifies the nidanas in a different way to children and adults. Am I right that for Buddhists life begins at conception, but this "life" isn't fully conscious, because nama-rupa has not yet developed and so the concomitant links likewise? Or is the difference between a fetus and a baby more like the difference between a child and an adult? 

Does every tradition, especially ones descended from the lotus sutra and the Buddha's immeasurable life, claim that parinirvana is a conventional existent? Assuming that it's not a dharma, I don't know. 

Allow me to take you on a little detour through Heidegger? He claims that "my death" is inalienably mine: that no one can die my death for me. I think this means that "my death" never arrives... That may sound weird, but if we view death as a complete extinction of the "person" or whatever makes them up, then the empirical instant that death begins necessarily goes unnoticed - as in I can have no cognition of "my death" or by proxy the time it occurs. i.e. It cannot be said that the event of my death is in any way only empircally real for me (because such a quality would never arrive): but who else dies for me? Which of course isn't very Buddhist... But it does make me wonder if a similar thing can be said about nirvanic extinction? Or is the true self of a Buddha his or her nirvana, such that it can be said the Buddha is no more, just not that he or she reached it? 

I thought this might be relevant: The formless meditations are part of the imageless realm arupa-bhava. According to Stefan Anacker in his book on Vasubandhu 

Are Therevada's cosmology and the Mahanaya's sutras physically, rather than only psychologically, plasusible? I read about the former in the abhidharmakosabhasyam, about all the hells and heavens that await us. And the Mahayana sutras often include reference to e.g. celestial bodhisattvas. I'm skeptical that these things have physical, rather than psychological, truth, empirical (we've this heaven) or otherwise (we have evidence that these heavens exist). As with with classical georgraphy, and history. My specific question is: 

Do transformation bodies appear before a buddha reaches enlightenment? So that the many bodies of Shakyamuni that the fan Wang ching (Sutra of Brahmas net) claims Vairocana manifests may have appeared before our Gautama Buddha? If the Buddha bodies do not all manifest at the same time then can two transformation bodies of the same Buddha appear in what will be the same Buddha field, at different times? I'm interested because I want to understand the lotus sutra and e.g. its claims about the Buddha's eternal life. 

So, to "learn" "that" "persons" (which don't exist) "have" "their" "svabhava" (which doesn't exist) "within" "their" "body" "is" "nirvana". Sorry for the excessive speech marks. It may be unclear what that amounts to? For me, in my ignorance, it means that nirvana has svabhava. 

Do fully enlightened "persons" still meditate, and why? I get why they keep living, to help sentient beings. But does meditation help in that way? 

Every Buddhist tradition claims that the agent of a (karmic) act experiences its result, even though the two are not the same. There is continuity. I can't say for every tradition, but right view, which is the 1st link on the noble 8-fold path of Theravada, is often said to include belief in this cause and effect. You can read about right view here. More generally, there's no need for any belief to consider yourself a non practicing Buddhist. And I've read monks suggesting you practice zen without belief in karma. 

Some philosophical interpretations of Nagarajuna do phrase it in terms of dependently arising things not really being caused. 

Supplication does appear in Buddhism, even though there is less emphasis on it than in Christian teachings: Buddhists are less likely to e.g. put their successes down to being blessed. Just an example quote form scholarly research: 

I've read the book Makers of Modern Korean Buddhism, and it was really interesting to read about the recent history of Buddhism, in Korea. And there's quite a few books on how Buddhism came to America etc.. And I have a few biographies of important monks. And I've read a bit about Bodhidharma, ch'an history in China, Tibetan dissemination, and the like. But is there any other scholarship, like the book on Korea above, I can read about recent Buddhist history, rather than personalities, today? 

What is the "ease" of the "dharma gate of ease and joy"? Can an unelightened person achieve it outside seated meditation? Ought I imagine everything is difficult, or everything is easy? How can we be effortful in our everyday lay tasks? 

Buddhists avoid 'reincarnation' instead of 'rebirth'. Especially if we don't mean rebirth into an intermediate state, the term 'reincarnation', to me, seems OK. Why does 'rebirth' imply there is no soul? Is it an etymological thing? Or something about putting the emphasis on 'birth' rather than the body? 

How does upaya (skillful means) feature in Tibetan Buddhism? I'm just intrigued, because the texts I've spent longer trying to 'get' seem to be more inspired by the lotus sutra. 

The question has historical precedents, and early Christian writers were baffled by the idea of Nirvana, on the grounds that they could not see the difference with a, presumably beatified, suicide. The analogy isn't quite as bad as you make out (I upvoted the question despite the potential antagonism to it), for a few reasons, including the suicide of some solitary Buddhas, and the supposed (?) loss of several hundred arhats, after the Buddha died. Obviously, Buddhas, as they need to preach the dharma, don't face any dilemma like that. To sum, it depends on what you think suicide, and by extension death, is. 

Is Sakyamuni a "higher power"? I know what I mean, by "higher power" but it may still be opaque, to you. I don't mean a substance, or all powerful personality. But something like that. So, I mean to ask, is he like the Abrahamic God? 

I would probably say that Goatama's medicine was infallible, but certainly would say that he was not omniscient in the Western sense. I have read a zen master say he wasn't, too (IIRC!). But, perhaps he stayed silent (like Wittgenstein suggested) about what he didn't know, and he knew what he didn't knew. IMVHO a better potentially more fruitful way of thinking about it would be to ask: did Goatama know everything there was to know about his Buddha field? And then, what was his Buddha field, did it include everything that happened or only the way sentient beings were suffering. 

Is it possible, having been taught meditation by a zen master, to naturally enter the 1st three jhanas. By that, I mean through mental effort which is not really meditation as we normally think of it (seated or walking, all effort being applied to that). I ask because the 1st three jhanas seem, potentially, much more mundane than the rest, worldly. e.g. I feel pretty strong sensations of pleasure most of the time, as long as I'm not there and then planning to do something. If that second paragraph seems super delusional, then how close is dhyana to a pleasure in which you can't identify why you feel good? 

Apologies for stating this, because users of the site may have noticed that I ask many similar questions, but, from wikipedia... 

I take 'pantheism' to be the belief that all our talk about God can resolve into "the world", while retaining the divine status of "God", perhaps because our words about God retain their structure. What would Buddhists say about the idea that the world or universe is God? 

Which is very, very close to exactly what I mean: compassion towards someone who you have punished or harmed. Because it seems to me to be the bedrock of intelligent ethics, I was very interested in if the Buddha ever discussed this. 

Or must we just count our breaths and repeat the phrase? I was asked I think "what is your original face" - and I think it's the way / tao, but that's just something that occurred to me, I wrote down on a computer and it seemed alright. It's not that I want to be a part of some tradition or church, really. But all I got out of counting breaths was a lot of leg pain, somewhat (but not completely) offset with some nice feelings and lots of stuff like this /<<<^^^^^ 

Have Buddhas escaped samsara? Obviously there is the mainly Chinese term "non-abiding in nirvana". I'm interested in an answer from any tradition at all, and for enlightened non-Buddhas, too. To be specific, I would like to know if when a Buddha dies they then suffer death, or whether their death is somehow something over and above the suffering of samsara. I'm asking just because I think that's how I'd like the near eternal rounds of rebirth to end, perhaps with a little regret. Cheers. 

I know that the term is used in Buddhism, at least after its sinification. Often noumenon seems to mean reality itself, the buddha nature. Avoiding that last gloss, may I ask if the "noumenon" is "mind"? And whether extinction, be that impermanence, nirvana or final nirvana, is noumenally real? 

Emphasis mine. Given the conventional theory of karma (the actor is not different to who experiences the result) it seems like you're asking whether bad karma can ever be exhuasted. I would say yes. There's definitely an imperative to avoid both extremes (austerities and indulgence), though, even if that only applies to those on the path, which it likely doesn't anyway 

I think it translates as e.g. "one who has thus gone". My question is whether any historical being has ever really and in entirety "thus gone". Perhaps in spirit, or in expression, but if e.g. Gautama really did - wouldn't we all be likewise "thus come"? 

It appears in all the Chinese influenced Buddhist "schools" I have encountered, in various forms, even if just exhorted against. Not sure if it's originally Indian. 

Which Buddhists say that there are no conventionally existent wholes, and what's the best reason for the claim? My "whole" I mean something more than the sum of its parts, an object that does not reduce to its parts.
