I really want to answer this question with 100% confidence but I can't find the evidence to back it up. This is the best I can do... 1) There are individual studies about each of the recovery methods you inquired about; but, no study (that I can find) directly comparing the two. Each of the recovery methods are valid in their own right. Everyone is different though, and all of the methods won't work wel lfor each person. 2) To the best of my knowledge there is not any danger the muscle will heal improperly. The risk you run by not (at the very least) actively stretching the affected muscles is a loss in range of motion. 3) On page 222 in the book "Skeletal Muscle Repair and Regeneration By Stefano Schiaffino, Terence Partridge" Click here It shows exactly how scar tissue is formed during the repair of skeletal muscle. However, lifting doesn't cause complete transverse tear of the sarcomere. Lifting causes a breakdown in the muscle, not a complete rip. Therefore I do not believe scar tissue is formed during weight-lifting unless you happen to completely tear the muscle you are using. 

I think it comes down to preference as long as it takes your heart rate accurately. I prefer the HRMs that provide a strap that goes around your chest. Most machine will pick up on this so you won't always need your watch (unless you have timers set up on them). You can test the watch by finding your pulse (in your dominant hand) on the thumb side of your forearm near your wrist. Feel your pulse and count. If you count for 15 seconds multiply by 4 and then look at the monitor and see if it is close! Counting to 60 will be more accurate (no need to multiply by anything since you've counted for a minute). 

If the calories for your workout were the only ones burnt per day your math would be correct. However, everyone has a resting metabolic rate (RMR). A RMR is the amount of energy (in calories) it would take for your body to perform the basics to keep you alive (breathing, heart beat, etc.). Everyone's RMR is different, dependent upon several factors (including age, gender, genetics, lean muscle mass, etc.), and can only be calculated via an RMR test. Unless you have thyroid issues your RMR is probably in the 1200-1600cal range. This means with your exercise you are actually burning 1700-2100ish calories a day. Therefore you are actually a net loss of 200-600 calories a day. With 3500 calories in one pound, you'd be losing one pound every 6 days or so. A lot of other factors can play in to this, just putting the math into perspective. You are probably tired because you are working really hard and not consuming enough to make up the deficit. 

Any time you change your body's orientation to an exercise the muscle is used differently. One of the easiest-to-see examples of this is your bicep. Bend your elbow so your palm is facing towards you and look at your bicep, then turn your hand away from you and you will see your bicep disengage and your brachialis engage. Holding your hands at a wider grip forces you to use your lats more. Close grip pull-ups allow you to use more of your bicep to pull yourself up. Therefore the wide-grip pull-up seems hard because you only use your lats. 

Hyperkyphosis - hunched back-, due to muscle imbalance, is normally caused by weak mid back muscles (rhomboids, part of traps, levator scap, etc.) and tight pectoral muscles. This is common in high school age wrestling athletes for example. Seated rows, shoulder shrugs, rotator-cuff exercises; while paired with pectoral stretches can help correct this. If you have hyperkyphosis because you have a degenerative disc disease, there is not a lot you can do. Lordosis - sway back -, due to muscle imbalance, needs to be addressed with low back and glute muscle stretches while strengthening your lower abs and hip-flexor muscles can greatly improve your posture. Good luck. 

It is all balanced by osmosis. Once your muscle stores of glycogen start being depleted, your body converts blood sugar (glucose) into glycogen in the muscle being depleted. So your muscles will still get glycogen, just not from other muscles. As an aside, your body is not very good at this. 

I made a quick reference here to look at nerve innervation originating below L5. Your abs should not give out due to the degradation and a loss of innervation. If the degradation was causing the problem it is much more likely that your glutes are giving out. Since they are a major stabilizing muscle this is a viable possibility. You should definitely strengthen your core (abs, back, obliques, etc.). Remember to stretch too, though. Having tight muscles that attach to the pelvis (hamstrings, piriformis, gultes, etc.) can pull the pelvis out of alignment. In turn, causing mal-positioning with your back and hips (which then affects the rest of your body). When doing squats, maybe try using a weight-lifter's belt. While your body is out of balance you should try to assist yourself while possible. All the while, training those weaker muscles to rely less on the assisted devices. Remember that pain is bad. If something is causing sharp pain, STOP. And as always, consult your PT or a Physician if you are unsure if you should continue to exercise. 

Okay, so most of these suggestions are relatively disturbing from an exercise science point of view. While I agree that the valsalva maneuver is common place in power lifting it is still dangerous. Internally, when you hold your breath, your inner thoracic cavity pressure sky rockets. It is the reason if someone has an inguinal hernia while weight lifting they can lose a testicle. This isn't always true but it is a possibility, and isn't just caused by weight lifting. Ever seen that video of the guy power squatting and halfway up he vomits everywhere? His esophageal sphincter could not handle the pressure his body was putting on his stomach forcing the contents outward. Placing a lot of force on your vagal nerve in the back of your throat while using the valsalva maneuver also slows your heart rate and can cause you to pass out. It is a risk benefit analysis on your part. For most people you should inhale on the eccentric motion (muscle lengthening) and exhale on the concentric motion (shortening of the muscle). Using support belts if you're performing heavy squats will give you the extra support that you might need instead of utilizing the valsalva manuever. 

You need to consult a sports nutritionist. There are FAR too many variables that affect your metabolism and how you digest food to tell you what you need. That being said, you can take a few things into consideration. 1) You have to consume calories if you want to lose weight. -If your body is needing 2,500 CAL/day, and you are only consuming 1,500 your body will think you are starving. This does not mean eat a 2,000 CAL burger, you still have to be responsible with your calorie consumption. 2) Carbohydrates are needed to burn fat. -Therefore, you CAN NOT burn fat without carbohydrates in your diet. You will lose fat size; but, you will not actually burn the fat. Mike S. is correct about the varying degrees at which people burn carbohydrates. This is one of the reasons you need to consult a sports nutritionist. 3) After a certain point, protein consumption becomes inefficient and you pee out excess. -This level is different for everyone and is another reason you need to consult a professional. The United States Registered Dietitian's Association states that it, "recommends 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of ideal body weight per day." A sub-point to be made here is that natural sources of protein are more beneficial that supplements. The exception to that rule is when you can not consume enough protein by eating regular foods and need a supplement. 

You can still put on mass without lifting to failure every time. I will say though, you get out of exercise what you put into it. If you are constantly adding 2, 3, 5kgs often, you are doing something right. I am a big fan of perfect form over sloppier form to get up a little more weight. Note: I am not a power lifter. Try doing some "negatives" your last few repetitions. After lifting the weight (lets take biceps for example) to your shoulders, SLOWLY lower the weight back to the starting position at your hips. You can perform whole sets like this, or just the last few repetitions in a set. Your muscles will fatigue a lot quicker and it might give you the extra "oomph" to your workout that you have been looking for. 

It sounds like the pain in your hip is coming from your hip-flexors. This group is comprised of the: Illiopsoas; Sartorius; and Rectus Femorus. Their purpose is to: Flex your hip joint; Flex your trunk forward; Pull your thigh upward; and to help stabilize your lower body (at the pelvis). 

Probably the most specific answer to your the part of your question pertaining to the endocrine system. The reason you give your muscles that 48 hour rest period is to ensure it has enough time to repair the micro-tears that strength training creates. I know that a lot of people swear by groupings for alternating days (back/biceps Monday, Chest/triceps Tuesday, etc.); however, I find that it is much easier to alternate hemispheres of your body (Upper body on Monday, lower on Tuesday). The reason for this is because: even if you have perfect lifting form, you still use varying muscles as support/stabilizing musculature for lifts. Example, try using a French bar for standing, unsupported bicep curls and NOT letting your pec muscles activate. While you are not actively using the muscles, if your goal is to give your body the best total rest it can have, you should try to not use them as much as possible. Yes, some leg exercises require upper bod stabilizers. However, you use them far less than if you try to split the upper body into several alternating day exercises. 

The answer is no. As long as you aren't adding a 10 pound plate to the right side of the bar and a 2.5 pound weight on the left, center of balance should not be affected. Also, if I understand your set up correctly, you should not be able to add more pates than there is bar space... Therefore the center of the handle should always be the same distance from your body as in your example. I am trying to think of examples where weight-plate circumference would affect your range of motion. If we look at standing, palm forward bicep-curls, I might could see where this is a problem. My solution for this would be to sit on a bench, sit wide-legged, lean forward slightly, place my elbow of the arm I am working on the inside of the same knee (right elbow to right inside, left to left) and do isolation curls. This way your bicep is still being worked but it moves your arm in such a way that the range of motion from the increased plate size should not be a factor. Maybe pictures of the equipment would help? 

The younger you are, the more likely your skin is to return to a more "normal" or "tight" state. However, depending on the length of time the skin has been stretched, the extent to which it has been stretched (think about really bad stretch marks) it might not return to that "normal" state even at a young age. One of the only solutions I know of is surgery. I hope someone else can answer this that might have heard of a less invasive solution. 

Palpitations can be a result of many things going on with your heart. Atrial Fibrillation, 1st 2nd or 3rd degree heart blocks, and a few others come to mind. The important thing to note is any time you heart starts doing something abnormal, even if you aren't sure if it is a normal response, CALL YOUR DOCTOR. Most exercise induced palpitations can be worked with if treated and monitored by a physician. If left un-diagnosed and untreated they can be fatal. When you call your doctor ask if having an exercise stress test with an EKG hooked up to you. (In all honesty they will suggest you do this anyway). See your doctor sooner than later though. Good luck. 

Planks! As long as you have proper form they are very good at building strength for your core without having to do crunches. 

Notice that the same measurements occur both in treadmill and road form. The downside to both become the accuracy of the equipment and the real world application. Treadmills can be off for any number of reasons. Because the grade is measured via distance and height -> if the odometer or incline motor are off, the calculations produce the same on-screen Grade% while the treadmills can be at very different angles. In the real world, a 10% grade over a 5 mile long climb (in the mountains, for example) is not always a change of 528 feet per mile (5,280 feet). Sometimes there are longer somewhat flatter sections and then more steep sections. On my drive back from college there were several "severe grade" warnings where you wouldn't be through the full decent of the mountain but you'd be climbing a hill again because of the lay-of-the-land. 

This is, from what I can tell, four questions in one. 1) How much of strength training about optimally breaking down muscle, even for beginners? Strength training is always about optimal muscle breakdown. However, there are varying levels of what one wants to achieve strength wise. Are you trying to train for the next strong-man contest? Mr./Mrs. Universe? Recovering from chemotherapy? Sport specific? Each one requires a different regimen, but all are geared towards optimal muscle breakdown. Endurance training for your muscles is different as well. This style is more about getting to a certain strength point and being able to repeat the movements a lot. An elderly person, for example, would want to endurance train their muscles to help them with activities of daily living (getting out of a chair, lifting groceries, taking stairs more easily, etc.). 2) How many sets and repetitions would one need to do to achieve an optimal breakdown? There are so many ways to answer this question it is ridiculous. It really depends on what you are trying to achieve. 3) What are appropriate rest times between sets, and then between workouts? See question two. 4) When do routines need to be changed to keep having an optimal effect? This depends on what you are trying to achieve... Bulking-up? Change more than you stay the same (this is still debatable, I was thinking for starters though). Just want to be able to get groceries out of the car? Don't need to change once you get to a weight that you feel meets your grocery lifting needs. This question is VERY broad and I hope a couple of other posters can help expound on my answers. 

Let me start by saying, I have a Bachelor's degree in Exercise Science and no doctorate to my name. That being said, it sounds more like a nerve impingement. Wiki yourself a diagram of how nerves run through the arm and you will see exactly where the nerves run. This can be caused by mal-alignment of joints, muscles pressing on the nerve, or even external pressures (think numb leg after sitting on the couch). If the numbness progresses or fails to go away after a short while (post exercise) you NEED TO SEE A DOCTOR IMMEDIATELY. Now, I have had a patient in my care complain of this exact same problem. They had tried stretching, ice/heat therapy, NSAIDs, etc. The thing that worked, and what I would recommend you try, is finding a good massage therapist that can work your arm back to its normal state. 

My wife and I just had a baby. Her OBGYN told her (remember everyone is different) it was based off of how active she was before hand. Since she went to the gym 5-6 days a week, she continued to exercise and go to Zumba classes until 1 week before he was born. She did have to leave class to pee more as the baby tap-danced on her bladder though. Talk to your doctors and figure out a plan that is right for you! 

You are within the normal limits. Anything above 60 beats per minute and below 100 beats per minute is normal for a resting heart rate. Once your heart rate dips below 60 bpm, you are in Bardycardia (means slow heart). After breaching 100 bpm you are in Tachycardia (means fast heart). Typically people that are more physically fit (cardiovascularly, not strength) have a lower resting heart rate than others that don't. However, this is not always the case. There are several medications (prescription and over the counter) that can both slow heart rates (like beta-blockers) or speed them up (think about pills with caffeine in them). As long as you are not having any abnormal signs or symptoms (shortness of breath, light head, dizzy, confused, tunnel vision, chest pain, etc.) a heart rate between 60-100 should not be an issue. However, your primary care physician will be the best person to talk to about any concerns you might have. If they feel it is necessary they can refer you to a Cardiologist as well. Everyone's heart rate is a little different. I have seen several athletes with resting heart rates in the 80s, and several geriatric patients (not on rate limiting medications) with heart rates in the 60s.
