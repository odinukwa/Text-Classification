Romantic or partnership love and sexual desire need not have the same object. There I agree; and this suggests to me the question whether the two are conceptually distinct and if so, how ? The conceptual dimension brings the issue within philosophy. Certainly both concepts are open to philosophical analysis. Sexual desire is driven by sexual attraction and motivates sexual activities of various kinds. I do not propose to try to define 'sexual' but its contextual meaning is obvious. I should find it hard to credit someone who claimed to have no idea what sexual intercourse is, or non-penetrative sex or oral sex. Romantic or partnership love centres not on sexual desire but on emotional attachment - attachment both to another person and, not infrequently, attachment to the children produced by a partnership. If sexual desire produces children, partnership love looks after them. But partnership love can produce children in the absence of sexual desire. Partnership love and sexual desire can combine in the institution of marriage or cohabitation but this is sociology. Conceptually one can have partnership love for someone for whom one has no sexual desire; one can have sexual desire for someone for whom one has no partnership love. One can have sexual desire for many persons and partnership love for only one; or partnership love for many, and sexual desire for only one (though this is probably rare). The permutations are multiple. Something to add is that sexual desire and partnership love can be cross-gender in the sense that one can have sexual desire for one's own gender and partnership love for a different gender. And vice versa. It is a psychological question whether life is more satisfying or open to deeper possibilities when partnership and sexual love combine and centre on the same object - or rather, person. It is also debatable and problematic and I glad not to be doing psychology. 

Jacob Ross, Rejecting Ethical Deflationism,' Ethics 116, 2006: 742–68 defines nihilism as : ▻ NIHILISM - DEFINITION '...the view that the notions of good and bad and of right and wrong are illusions and that, objectively speaking, no option or state of affairs is better than any other, nor are any two options or states of affairs equally good. Thus, while uniform theories assign the same value to all of our options, nihilistic theories don’t assign values to any of our options' (748). Naturally I don't know how acceptable this definition will be. One of its merits is that if this is what nihilism plausibly is, then it's hard to see how one could adopt nihilism and also believe that life has any meaning. ▻ NIHILISM - CURRENT INFLUENCE Postmodernism appears to deprive virtually everything of meaning. But I don't think it has played a central role here. Relativism is a deeply entrenched style of contemporary thinking. Anyone who passes a moral or an aesthetic judgement is likely to meet with a response like : 'Well, that's just your opinion - other people think differently. You can't prove your opinion is better than theirs'. This is quite in line with Ross' definition and the relativist attitude behind it is a pervasive fact of contemporary life. ▻ NIHILISM - SOURCES OF POWER Globalisation might (innocently) be a part cause of the current power of nihilism. As different lifestyles and belief-systems come into deep and frequent contact, it's hard to find an Archimedean point from which to survey them and make an informed, critical judgement between them. A collapse of tradition in the West, an implosion of communitarianism, has also played a part. People who are rooted in stable traditions don't doubt that life has a meaning; they have grown up with the idea of its having a particular meaning, the meaning set and fixed by the communities to which they belong and feel themselves to belong. The earlier work of Michael Sandel, esp. 'Liberalism and the Limits of Justice', Cambridge, UK : Cambridge University Press, 1998, heavily attacked the liberal political philosophy of John Rawls for its view of a political system designed by 'unencumbered selves', people without roots, tradition or community. Maybe we are all more or less unencumbered now. The melting and merging of social classes also comes into the picture. If classes were not communities, class cohesiveness (and not least working-class solidarity) imprinted a sense of who one was, who one wasn't, who was the ally and who the foe. A committed trade unionist, a militant communist, a rentier, had no doubt that life had a meaning even if they never used the phrase. Today most people describe themselves as 'middle class' in spite of not having any sharp sense of class and of holding widely divergent values which, in face of relativism (see above), they cannot defend : values which therefore are only simulacra of the real thing. 

Fallibilism : I wonder if this is an epistemology that would meet your requirements. The definition of fallibilism is a matter of some controversy but I take fallibilism to have two components. One is the conjoint assumption that few would deny, namely that (a) none of our beliefs is certainly true and (b) we are prone to error. Neither entails the other but the two fit well together. At the very least both appear to be true. The other is that S can know that p even if S lacks logically conclusive evidence to justify her in believing that p. We certainly use the term 'know' when this condition is met. There is a bunch of tulips in S's room. T, a normally reliable witness, has just told her this. S has seen someone go into the room with a bunch of tulips and come out without them. She herself has just looked into the room and what in conditions of normal illumination looks like a bunch of tulips is on the table. This would not satisfy the condition of Cartesian knowledge. Descartes but most of us would accept that, all else equal, S knows that there is a bunch of tulips in the room. S's belief is not certainly true and she is just as prone to error as the rest of us. S lacks logically conclusive evidence to justify her in believing that there is a bunch of tulips in the room. But do we need more than fallibilism offers ? We need a concept of knowledge that is serviceable, not drastically Cartesianly immune from error. (A serviceable concept of knowledge is a functional concept; what counts as knowledge are beliefs about our environment that can guide our actions to a successful outcome (EJ Craig, 'The Practical Explication of Knowledge', 'Aristotelian Society, 87, 1986-7 : 215.) Fallibilism allows S to know that p on the basis of less than logically conclusive evidence, yet leaves S's and everyone else's knowledge - belief based on less than logically conclusive evidence - permanently open to revision, correction. The bunch of flowers which on the evidence described S believed that there is a bunch of tulips in her room at time t may no longer be there at t+1 and yet S retain her belief, which no longer amounts to knowledge. Do you need a different epistemology than this ? One tighter in what it will allow as knowledge. I don't think I do but it's your question. I can only give my own answer. Of course no philosophical view is quite free from difficulty. (a) says that none of our beliefs is certainly true. But if I believe that I believe something, then this belief does seem certainly true. I don't know the best way of dealing with this but it strikes me as a special class of belief with which a generally serviceable theory of knowledge can pragmatically work without resolving. 

If every person has a creator, it does not follow that there is a single creator that creates every person. Theoretically every person might have a separate, different creator. It also does not follow that if there is a single creator, that creator is God : I know you don't say that it is but the mistake is often made. If there is a single creator, your problem simply moves up a level. Either nothing caused the creator's existence or the creator caused the creator's own existence. The latter would make the creator 'causa sui', self-created. How the creator could cause the existence of the creator is not apparent. 

Critical theory, focused among other things on popular culture, dates I should say from the Frankfurt School founded in 1923 at the Institut fur Sozialforschung. There are no abrupt beginnings in the history of social theory; prefigurations of the work of the Frankfurt School are evident in Georg Simmel or even earlier in (how can we avoid the name ?) Marx. Early members of the Frankfurt School included Carl Grunberg, Max Horkheimer. Friedrich Pollock, Leo Lowenthal, Theodor Adorno, Herbert Marcuse, and Erich Fromm formed an inner circle around Horkheimer, who became Director in 1930. It was in the 1930s and 40s that the School started to pay serious, systematic attention to the Nazi penetration of German society, to aesthetics, and to popular culture. The School's influence greatly expanded when under Nazi hostility it relocated to Holland in 1931 and, of crucial importance, when in 1934 it re-established itself as the 'Institute of Social Research' at Columbia University in New York. The transatlantic transfer transformed the School into a formidably influential intellectual force. A useful source is Martin Jay, The Dialectical Imagination. Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1973. Since there was so much collaborative work in the School, it is perhaps invidious to name the first philosopher who undertook the type of social analysis you are interested in. But Horkheimer's inaugural lecture as Director, 'The Present Situation of Social Philosophy and the Tasks of an Institute for Social Research', puts popular culture clearly in its sights. See Max Horkheimer, 'Between Philosophy and Social Science: Selected Early Writings', tr. Frederick Hunter, Matthew S. Kramer, John Torpey, Cambridge: MIT Press, 1993. 

Too little is known about the philosophical and religious beliefs of the historical Socrates, which are known to us mainly through the writings of Xenophon and Plato, to assign Orphic origins to any of his beliefs. It is widely thought that the early Socratic dialogues of Plato reflect the historical Socrates' actual views or something very close to them but even this is unprovable. We don't know what Socrates believed except insofar as these views are refracted through the lens of a philosophical genius, Plato, and the intellectually pedestrian figure of Xenophon. (Which is not to dismiss Xenophon as a worthless witness.) Russell at his best was a philosopher of immense greatness. Russell as a historian of Western philosophy is no safe guide. Try C.C.W. Taylor, 'Socrates - A Very Short Introduction', Oxford, 2000. This at least is the work of a philosopher, historian and Greek scholar. Our knowledge of Socrates is too frail a web to be handled by Russell's rough fingers. 

POSTSCRIPT Virmaior's comments and advice are as always excellent; I have separated Nietzsche and Kierkegaard from the others. There would not be room in any case to provide an adequate answer for all the philosophers you mention.
