The EUVE catalog gives you a count-rate in a certain EUV band. To convert this into a flux, you need a flux conversion factor to go from counts per second to energy flux at the Earth per second. This conversion factor, also often known as an "ECF", depends on the intrinsic spectrum of the source and also how much absorption (known as the hydrogen column density) there is between Earth and the source. So there is no one answer that can be given. I Your best port of call is the PIMMS flux conversion tool, which has an EUVE module and can do these flux conversions for you if you know something about the spectrum and the absorption. I'd try it for you but I couldn't immediately see how to do it for EUVE, though it claims the information is there... 

The Hayashi track has an almost constant effective temperature. The pre main sequence star (not protostar) is powered by the release of gravitational potential energy caused by its contraction. If the star is getting smaller at constant effective temperature, then of course it's luminosity ($\propto R^2 T^4$) decreases. So perhaps your question is why do PMS stars contract at constant temperature? In other words, why is the Hayashi track almost vertical in the HR diagram? The answer to this is derived in some detail on the relevant Wikipedia page and arises from the fact that low mass PMS stars are fully convective and have atmospheric opacity dominated by H- ions. 

If you suddenly sucked all the heat out of a normal star like the Sun, nuclear reactions would cease, the gas pressure would fall to zero. The star would collapse, initially on a freefall timescale (about 1 hour for the Sun). The released gravitational potential energy would half be radiated away and half would go into re-heating the interior. The temperature would rapidly rise, the collapse would be halted, nuclear reactions would restart, the star would slowly expand again and a thermal and hydrostatic equilibrium should be restored on a Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale (about 10 million years for the Sun). One way to see this, is to compare the current thermal content of a star with its capacity for generating new heat by nuclear reactions. e.g. approximate the Sun as a uniform ball of ideal gas at an average temperature of a few million degrees. The thermal content is roughly $10^{41}$ J. The Sun generates this much energy in nuclear reactions in only 8 million years - coinciding with the timescale to reestablish an equilibrium. Or you could compare it with the gravitational potential energy of around $2\times 10^{41}$ J. i.e. There is enough gravitational potential energy to reheat the Sun. However, not everything would be a continuation. The collapse and reheating would be similar to the star repeating its pre main sequence phase. During this phase the star becomes fully convective and so the core material would get completely mixed with the rest of the star again. This would have the effect of rejuvenating the star as a new zero age main sequence star, but with a slightly higher helium abundance. 

Jupiter probably originated with a dense core, and then accreted a gaseous envelope. To call the core "rocky" could be misnomer, since the planet formed much further out from the Sun where it may have been possible to form ices. The exact location of Jupiter's birth and the composition of its core are not known, but the composition was unlikely to have been the same as Earth. It is also probable (again, theory not fact), that Jupiter's core may have reached multiple Earth masses before accreting the gaseous envelope. 

The way that you have specified the question, the answer is as far as you like. You simply put your spaceship into any orbit around the black hole and wait. A more sensible question is what is the largest time dilation factor that can be accomplished - i.e. that maximises your travel time into the future for a given amount of proper time experienced on the spaceship. This in turn is governed by how close to the black hole you can come and still tolerate the tidal forces. If you don't put a limit on this (your first case), then the answer is again infinite; you can hover as close to the event horizon as you like, using an enormous amount of rocket fuel, and the time dilation (see below) can be arbitrarily large. Your second case is more realistic. Roughly we can say that the tidal acceleration across a body of length $l$ is given by $GMl/4r^3$, where $M$ is the black hole mass and $r$ is the distance from the black hole. If we make this acceleration equal to say $1 g$, and your body length $l \sim 1$m, then for a $5M_{\odot}$ black hole $r \simeq 2500$ km (well outside the Schwarzschild radius of 15 km). If you could "hover" at this radius, then the time dilation factor would be $$\frac{\tau}{\tau_0} = \left( 1 - \frac{2GM}{rc^2}\right)^{1/2},$$ where $\tau$ is the time interval on a clock on the spaceship and $\tau_0$ is the time interval well away from the black hole. For $M=5M_{\odot}$ and $r = 2500$ km, this factor is 0.9970. If the spaceship is in a circular orbit, the factor is $(1 - 3GM/rc^2)^{1/2} = 0.9955$. These factors are perhaps not as big as you might have imagined! 

This is a very broad question and though a comprehensive answer lies outside the scope of this simple Q&A format, I give you a couple of examples where "neutrino telescopes" would revolutionary. 

But you demonstrate that you know the answer to this question! Fainter objects have larger magnitudes. So as the white dwarf becomes cooler and redder, its blue magnitude $(G_{BP})$ grows by more than its red magnitude $(G_{RP})$ and the colour-index $(G_{BP} - G_{RP})$ becomes larger. This is very similar to the commonly used $B-V$ colour, which is larger for cooler stars. 

We can't. All astronomical observations are of things as they were at a time in the past that depends how far away the object is. We understand that. If we need to calculate the future behaviour of an object, then our extrapolation begins from that past point in time to work out a trajectory through time and space. 

To first order, the relative abundances of the heavier elements to iron (for instance) are constant. So the metal content of a star is shorthand for the content of any element heavier than He. (NB: we now know this is not true in many circumstances and elements can be grouped by synthesis process - for example we can talk about "alpha elements" - O, Mg, Si etc. produced by alpha particle capture; or s-process elements - Ba, Sr etc. produced by the s-process). The next point is why they are referred to as "metals" rather than another term like "heavies" or something. I would guess this is down to a bit of history and the fact that initial abundance analyses in stars were (and still are) done in the visible part of the spectrum. The most abundant elements heavier than He are in fact not metals. They are Oxygen, Carbon and Nitrogen. However, the signatures of these elements are not as obvious in the visible spectra of (most) stars as the signatures of elements like Fe, Na, Mg, Ni etc., which decidedly are metals. 

We do not know whether Jupiter has a solid core. That is one of the primary goals of the Juno mission. In general it is clear that a solid core is not required to generate magnetic fields. The Sun does so and magnetic fields have been measured (with average surface field strengths of around 3 kG) on very low mass stars. Incidentally, the Sun's magnetic field does have a large scale dipole component. More recently, there have been observations of cyclotron and auroral emission suggesting that even old, cold brown dwarfs have strong, organised magnetic fields. See for example Kuznetsov et al. (2012); Hallinan et al.(2015) and references therein. $URL$ $URL$ At the moment, nobody can say for sure how exactly these fields are generated, sustained and organised. In fact you could do worse than look at a paper that popped up at the top of today's astro-ph listings by Williams et al. The abstract begins: "The well-studied M9 dwarf TVLM 513-46546 is a rapid rotator (P_rot ~ 2 hr) hosting a stable, dipolar magnetic field of ~3 kG surface strength." $URL$ 

A plot showing the paths (solid lines) of stars of different masses from birth (the Sun is still $\simeq 1M_{\odot}$ at birth) in luminosity and temperature, until they begin the H-burning main sequence. The dashed lines are "isochrones" at the indicated ages. The Sun "begins" its life (or at least emerges from its natal gas and dust less than a million years after birth) at the top of the $1M_{\odot}$ track. The second phase is of course much longer, but the changes are far less dramatic. For the next 4.45 billion years the Sun just gets a little brighter and a little larger, but stays more-or-less at the same temperature. Over that time the Sun has got about 30% more luminous and 15% larger at a roughly constant rate. If you need more detail than that, then you need to access a proper stellar evolutionary model. There are lots of those available. e.g. the Geneva models (the Schaller et al. 1992 set are appropriate for the Sun).
