It's valid question, but that depends on whether or not the interviewer thinks having a CS Degree with an emphasis on programming is a requirement. Many programmers have degrees in other areas (I'm majored in education) and many don't have degrees at all. You want to be a programmer and are in a CS degree program, why wouldn't you want to focus on software development? Learning to program takes a time commitment. Is this something you're learning in your spare time? Don't you want a solid foundation? What the interviewer should want to hear is how does the degree you're in help you become a better programmer. A liberal arts degree can make you a better programmer because there are other soft skills and communication skills needed for the "job" of being a programmer and not just the "task" of programming. You're not taking what most people would think is the obvious path of majoring in CS and emphasizing programming, so you'll need to clarify it. Either you can program or you can't in my book, so all the extra "fluff" of the interview may give some insight into how you'll fit into the team, you're work ethic, etc. 

Do a little research on average salaries in your area and for the work you do. Be prepared to justify why you are better than the average going rate. You may get some pushback about the company not being willing to pay that much; be ready do avoid any reaction indicating you don't believe them. If you don't ask you rarely get as much. This will be good practice in negotiating for a salary at the next job. At some point, you have to feel a company is less than honest when they have such wide discrepancies in salary among employees doing the same work and not justification they are significantly better. 

You prior experiences with people in this age range may have been parents, older relatives, teachers and professions. The dynamic is very different when you work with people. Although you'll be in a position to receive some training and mentorship, they're not your parents. You're going to be expected to grow-up and act professional. They're not as rigid as you think. Most people when they started out probably worked with at least some people in this age range if not most. You expand your view of things. I think it's better than being around too many people who are just like me. Give it a chance. Soon, there will probably be more people your age. In a few years, you'll turn 30. Are you going to be able to work with someone who is 26? I hope so. 

Consider the interview with the software lead. You may learn more about the projects and his/her management style to help you have the most information to make a final decision. The one with the CEO/COO are just a formality and will give you little insight about the specific job. You can always tell them you're taking another offer, but would be open-minded if they wanted to interview you anyway. I'm guessing most managers would see this as a ploy to get a counteer-offer. If you were working with a recuriter, they'll want you to take the interview to fill their quota. The offer you're taking just seems like the best fit for you, either take the one interview (software lead) or cancel all of them. 

Wanting something more technical is a valid reason, but the work level expectations and informal and uncompensated over-time seem too negative and like you're complaining. Like all reasons, you may need to defend them a step further. If you prefer a more technical position, why did you take a sales position? Show why you've discovered it's not for you. Give examples of how doing technical work is more in your nature. Focus on why you think this new job is a better company. Acknowledge you are aware of their awards and that you want to work for that type of a company. For future reference, be careful about wanting to be thorough. Make sure your standards are in line with the business. At some point, you have to ship something. As great as the iPhone may be, it is far from perfect and we're on version what? 

Just because someone isn't more senior than you, doesn't mean there aren't certain things they know that you don't. Start some sort of study group in your junior team where everyone learns about something and shares it with the rest. Look into answering questions on Stackoverflow and joining a local developers meetup or association. You need to interact with more experienced people and be able to bounce your ideas off of them as well as learn other/better strategies. Working on an open source project is another way to have your code viewed along with seeing how development is done with a larger team. Learning on your own is good, but up to a certain point. What usually happens to loan developers is they end up with a solution that is only optimum relative to what they know. Work with others and stretch your skills. 

Why would your resume include a logo you didn't design? Focus on the things you did build and somehow mention you worked with an existing logo design. You need to learn how to tell people they're wrong without telling them they're wrong. Ask your boss to "sell" you on his logo. Don't do this by asking directly, but formulate questions to understand what the purpose of the logo is for the company. Your boss may be under the impression that the logo isn't going to make or break the company, so why not just use his since he likes it. Does it appeal to the target market? Have you even identified what that is? I'm no expert in this area, so it is important that you identify the final outcome and then work with clients on connecting their vision with what they hope to accomplish. Show them a disconnect between their color scheme and what we know about the affects of color on people, then you've given them information to make an informed decision. This may come across as being challenging to him, but you may want to do some A/B testing with several variations of his logo. See if some of the changes you would suggest actually matter. There's a big difference between what should work and what doesn't. 

You're probably not the first person with this affliction that needs to have a job, so speak with a physical or occupational therapist and find out what has worked for other patients. Spreading out a 40 hour work week may be just as good as 30 with fewer breaks. 

Your "Rockstar Programmer" mentality has caused you to fail to recognize what is important to your supervisor. He may feel (right or wrong) that keeping several lesser developers happy is more important than keeping you, so be careful. Start the conversation with your understanding of the job requirements when you accepted the job. Make a note that no one has previously complained about your 7 hr work day, but make sure you are very sure no one in fact has complained. Another area to focus on is the fact you get your work done. Concentration is key, so getting errands out of the way can be a great way to clear your mind for work. This could backfire and your boss will just give you more to do. 

I'd rather see you do something like write your own modulus function along with doing it the typical way. You would need to express the intent of your solution was to be able to come up with an alternative along with the notion you wouldn't attempt something like this with production code unless you could make a strong case for an obscure alternative. Unfortunately, some people will read too much into this approach. Finding good programmers is difficult, but they insist on looking for any hint of a personality trait that would make you unfit for their corporate culture. That's a shame. If part of the culture is to take yourself too seriously, you may want to do this just to weed-out prospective jobs where they have no sense of humor. 

I would suggest observing how your bosses go about interacting with others. How are they handling giving you this criticism of not being "positive" enough? This is how you find out what they're really after because positive thinking can be interpreted all kinds of ways. Don't consider it as completely undermining your core personality and changing who you really are. It's not about being fake. I habitually say please and thank you, but I don't consider myself to be well-mannered or excessively courteous; it usually gets me what I want. You're tweaking your behavior a little bit. My guess is they'll be happy if you're a little more positive. They'll be more comfortable around you (Pay attention to people's reactions when you're direct/blunt/honest/open or whatever you call it.). Good leaders/managers are able to adapt. Show you're willing to make an effort be positive. There may be some individual employees that if you're working one on one, you can just get to the point because that's what they prefer. Maybe in meetings with other managers and people outside your team, you need a different approach. 

Other than having a video camera, there's no way to know if the candidate is the one actually doing the typing. I suspected one candidate was on a skype call to get some help with a coding task I gave him as part of the interview. The candidate was clueless, so I cut it short and never hired them. I think you can give a coding task to do on their own, but put a lot more emphasis on a follow-up phone call or webex to have the candidate explain what they've done and most importantly why. It's a pleasure to actually watch a really good programmer perform her craft. It just doesn't take long to pick them out. If you can't get them to your office, you just have to use whatever technology you can or you may find your confidence level is going to decline. This is why it's important to build a network with other professionals and get great referrals. 

I think you really need to listen to what your supervisor is saying and not saying. Her immediate, off the top of her head and without any data to support it, answer was the fact she is impressed with the volume of work he gets done. Maybe this is her personal preference or maybe her boss and everyone else involved likes this as well. You brought up the number of bugs and the difficulty to fix them and/or add new features. Apparently, she doesn't see these as a major problem and has been willing to accept this risk. Perception is reality. A quick turn-around on a request is percieved as getting it done quickly. Yes, the users have to point out some bugs and they take longer to fix than they should, but no one is factoring that into their definition of how long did it take to get done. You've been given approval to try and implement some of the improvements you mentioned, but be careful, you have not been given approval to get fewer things done. You may have to start tracking your current process, so you have something to compare it to when you start making changes. The complaints about waiting too long could increase and make your newly implemented standards look bad. It will take time and some data to show fewer bugs and quicker turn-around on requests in the long-run (i.e. when things are delivered with fewer bugs.). 

I think you should take pride in the way you helped your team; that is what a real leader does. Be proud of that fact. It is tough not to get the official title, but you're still of value. Ask your boss if you need to continue what you're doing as it appears outside your team. Let your team know you're still there to help and will continue to take on the extra responsibilities until someone new is inserted. You may find this architect will only want to get involved with high-level issues and decisions. He/she will attend the meetings and appear to be in charge to the outside and will have the fancy title. I doubt this person wants to get involved with any team management, so you may continue that role. Talk to your boss about it. You could be declared the team lead/senior but not the project or product lead. If the new person is smart, he'll rely more on you. Your boss may not realize how important you are and will have to suffer the consequences if you have to leave. My guess is the company has this over-paid "architect" on the books and will look for a place to hide him. Some companies are too stupid to fire people, they'd rather keep paying them for some reason. Sorry this happened to you. I'll bet your team is proud of you and will regret not having you in charge. 

What skill is there to working extremely long hours? Are you saying they put in regular hours, because only going home to sleep sounds like a long work day. 

Since you want to ask for more money/benefits, being satisfied with your current salary isn't a reason. The company hasn't made any effort yet to try and retain employees so don't be so certain they want to keep you. Determine if they understand the value you bring to the company. They may have decided not to get into a salary war, so I would suggest asking for other benefits. You never know, you could ask for flex-time and they may just offer more money. Hard to determine if logical thinking is occuring at your company.
