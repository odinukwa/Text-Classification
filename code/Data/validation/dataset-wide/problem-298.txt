It's called Art Direction. It's telling you how to feel about the story and the situation. It's an associative visual language. Art direction is telling the viewer how to feel about the story through visual cues. If an alien city's buildings all look like Ancient Rome, we can make assumptions about their society, their government, how they will react to strangers. We'll fill in the blanks about their culture and their fundamental values. You don't need to waste time explaining their political landscape or religious history. In Star Wars, it doesn't take long to understand the Space Nazis are bad. In Alien, you know the wrecked spaceship is a spooky bad place full of scary deaths – in fact you know it long before the characters know it. You see it through the art direction. Unfortunately cookie-cutter production and audience expectations for the familiar often make a mess of it. Too many Hollywood projects mindlessly imitate other Hollywood projects, and too many over-produced films are just CGI-salad to begin with. 

I use software called Starry Night Pro. It allows you to "fly" to a star in the database and take a picture (with or without labels and guidelines). The software is not free, but it has many graphic options (from what I can tell on the comparison page, the cheapest version will accomplish this, the more expensive versions are for telescope control). This is one of the export options of the starfield from 18 Scorpii (approximately 180° field of view – about half of the sky) with labels for bright objects and galactic guides: 

The answer is unknown because there is no research into genetic causes for the human phenotypes we associate with ethnic traits. Actual genetic research has been looking for the causes of disease not aesthetics. This short paper Genetic determinants of phenotypic diversity in humans explains the issues involved in researching genetics: "The first disease traits to be ascribed to particular genes were Mendelian traits, which are controlled by a single gene and follow well defined models of inheritance…. The next, and more difficult, stage was to determine genes associated with the far more common complex (multigene) diseases…." TL;DR diseases that are caused by one gene are rare because it's easy for the phenotype (the appearance) of the disease to be recognized, and the population will naturally select (breed) against it. But most genetic diseases are not simple, they are a pokerhand of gene combinations that we are only beginning to map, and an estimated 70% of these complex diseases also have environmental triggers that can turn them on and off. It may be decades before we have enough genetic data to understand multi-gene diseases, and these are life-and-death medical conditions getting priority funding (cancer, heart disease, diabetes, etc). While it's likely that some ethnic phenotype gene combinations will be discovered, that is not the goal of any serious gene research – and there are plenty of articles debunking the claims of home gene test kits that claim to tell your ethnicity or likelihood of disease. In cases where a genetic marker is known, the extra risk of developing the disease is usually within a few percentage points – in some cases the evidence is so vague that an increase of risk cannot be calculated. A complete map of what triggers each and every ethnic phenotype is a long way away, and will likely only be discovered though meta-studies that compare databases from many earlier research studies (a percentage of people who identified as African American statistically carry xyz gene groups in common, etc). Since almost all current gene data is from people of European descent, it will take even longer before we know what we need to know to answer our questions about ethnic diversity. But it gets worse. Confirmation bias of the researchers has polluted genetic research from the start, and the notion that biodiversity is actually a good thing is unfortunately relatively new. The first century of gene theory reflected 19th Century ideas of "race entitlement" and fascist theories of dominance and submission, ethnic "superiority", and genetic determinism. It was accepted that evolution selects what is "best" and kills off traits that are "weak" – and no coincidence the theorists managed to conclude their own ethnic traits meant they were more evolved, while coincidentally other ethnicities were less evolved. Because researchers believed the philosophies of their age it influenced everything they observed, and even changed what they observed to fit the theory. One myth I was taught in school that lingers today was when researchers tried to make eye color fit the emerging genetic theories. They decided there were 3 eye colors, blue, brown, and green – which was actually a kind of brown (um, what…?). They theorized there was a recessive allele for blue eyes, and everything else was the other color, not-blue. Blue-eyed parents always have blue-eyed children (which was what they were actually observing), except that's not true. This isn't how eye color works at all, and eyes aren't even "blue". Scientists actually denied that certain eye colors exist because it didn't fit the simple theory. Now imagine this scenario for each and every ethnic trait. Curly hair, nostril width, brow bone... Who decides which ethnic traits are "legitimate" to look for, and where are we looking? It's a hornets nest. I understand your scenario, but when you get specific about describing this it's all going to get ugly so don't go there. Imply a combination of traits or make your colonists like trendy cornchip flavors: Persian-Hawaiian, Bantu-Lakota, etc. In reality, evolution is not a zero-sum game with clear winners and losers, and the environmental factors which help shape evolution are never constant. We now know environments can change drastically, even within a single lifetime. A new theory is emerging that biodiversity acts like a toolkit to respond to environmental changes, so here is your mandate for diversity in a space colony. Convince your colonists that biodiversity is the key to species survival, and you may be able to convince a generation that miscegenation is natural, healthy, and attractive. The fundamental goal of a colony is to survive, and you can land them with a crayola box of colors, but you need a philosophy that will get them through generations of plague, famine, war, mass suicide, and all the inevitable die-offs they will face. They may lose the technology to run a gene scan, but they can be taught to look for biodiversity in a mate. You could take that a step further and reinforce the beauty of biodiverse children, ergo mothers are discouraged from having children with similar-looking fathers. This assumes colonists are actually having children the old-fashioned way, beer and mood lighting, and not through family planning, lottery, or IncuBaby-9000™ – again, you have to plan for a worst-case scenario. If all technology fails, don't marry your brother. Does this trigger the H&M Fashion Model Apocalypse? Mmmm mabey… 

Discovery of the Earth's axial procession is attributed to Hipparchus in the 2nd Century BC, by comparing astronomy records written in the 3rd Century BC. But Hipparchus wasn't confirmed until Ptolemy in the 2nd Century AD. It took a half-millenia of relatively consistent data and a common written language to confirm it. $URL$ Hipparchus even confirmed the old observations in secondary sources, but the data he could match up was limited to a certain star on a certain date. He knew the stars around the ecliptic were moving, but didn't assume it was the whole sky (ie: the Earth moving, not parts of the sky). He didn't have the full picture, and didn't even have the exact years, so he made a rough estimate and dropped it, but if he'd had more data from the past he might have been able to calculate the axial procession more accurately. In an alternate history, the recorded data might have been preserved better over the centuries, and as he solved that rotation it might have occurred to him that everything processing means the Earth is wobbling. For a Worldbuild-y twist, our axial procession could be a little more obvious, or perhaps our orbit a little more elliptical, and it wouldn't have taken five centuries of written records to see long-term issues that the accepted epicycles didn't solve. 

Your question puts the cart before the horse. We can't give you any advice because we know nothing about the mechanics of your world. 

Yes. It's possible and probably easier than you think. Our brains have plasticity and adapt to the loss of a limb, but also remarkably will adapt to "sensing" a tool as an extension of the arm, called peri-hand extension. 

You can also export semi-realistic images to use as backgrounds (here's another view from 18 Scorpii. Stars are slightly exaggerated in size to make them easier to see): 

There is no way to know if your Immortal is smart enough to come up with innovations on his own, or have the vision to guide the development of a technology that never existed before (he's not a time traveller, right?), so there's no point in speculating what one person might have invented if he lived long enough. My answer is about WHEN his knowledge would have the biggest impact. If he was Chinese, and your story is set a few centuries earlier (say from 850 to around 1300) he could have gone far, even leading an army of Mongols to conquor all of Asia and half of Eastern Europe. That sounds pretty awesome, actually. Earliest recorded use of a gun-like weapon is the fire lance in the Siege of De'an in 1132, but it's reasonable to assume gun powder projectile weapons were around much earlier in some form. Siege of De'an is the earliest recorded battle where they were used (by the defenders, and history is written by the winners so they were probably advertising it). Here is an illustration of a fire lance drawn a couple of centuries later (image from the wikipedia article):
