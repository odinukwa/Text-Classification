It takes the Earth about 365.25 days to orbit the Sun on its current elliptical path. That means it moves about 30 km/s, 2×π×(149,600,000 km)/(1 year). So, given that, how high could Earth's velocity go before its orbit changes? 

The Fear of AI There are some good examples of humans being used over computers when the society has some reason to fear their computer-based creations. Battlestar Galactica being a prime example. In that society, the machines had rebelled so no computerized AI like system was trusted. While you don't need to go that far, a simple distrust of AI's backed by a few incidents could be all that's needed to give your story the logical reasons needed to keep a human hand on the trigger. Other examples of incidents involving AI/computers in fiction include: 

Transmit data via another dimension. We are all familiar with the 3 dimensional space (lets leave time out of it for the moment) we inhabit. Length, width, height. X, Y, Z. Some theories of physics say there are more than the three we can sense. It's possible they could be "bigger" or "higher" dimensions. Using an old thought experiment, Flatland, we can explore the idea a little easier. To the 2d occupants of Flatland, they can only see a limited area, however, you or I (living in 3d space) could see much more of Flatland be cause we can rise above it in a "higher" dimension. Such a thing could exist for us as well, something that a 4d creature would find elementary but we can't see. Back to Flatland, distance is fixed for them by the X and Y cords of the start and end point. Picture Flatland as a sheet of paper. To a Flatlander, it would not matter if that paper was flat or folder or a crumpled up ball. They would see it the same way. Their X and Y cords would not change at all. If they wanted to travel or transmit a message from XY1 to XY2 the distance is always the same using 2d methods. If they somehow managed to access the third dimension, they could see that what they perceive as a flat plane is in truth a waded up ball then by adding a Z to the existing X and Y cords the distance changes. Now if they somehow manage to manipulate their world in the third dimension they could draw any two X Y cords closer together on the Z-axis and transmit data as they please then that would allow them to effectively transmit data faster than the speed of light without breaking the light barrier. The same thing could happen in our 3d world. Breaking into a higher dimension and manipulating our X Y Z cords on this higher axis to pull the points closer together and transmit data effectively faster than the speed of light without breaking the light barrier. So your network nodes would fold space making a network of tunnels to transmit data with little delay. Around a planet or to another galaxy, it would make little difference. 

In no way is that a complete list, but they are good examples of incidents that could lead a society to not trusting AIs. Also, I would add that a healthy fear of AIs would be very "human". 

Short answer, yes. But it will not be free, the society pays a price. Creation myths are old and in the times now past populations were low and often not in touch with one another. In a world with more than just humans, this contact could have been even less or non-existent between the races. As example, the different races could have easily began in geographically distance areas. Or inaccessible areas. Then, after religions began, moved out from there. Most religions start with/are based on a creation myth. The crossover we see in Earth's religions most likely comes from early contact/conquest. Minimizing that in your world's history will also help strengthen arguments for no cross-over in belief systems. As populations spread, after a point in which each race has solidified their system(s), contact is a little less likely to result in contamination of beliefs. But not totally. You will need reasons for that to continue. Humans as an example, tend to question life and the universe. They look for meaning. Should they become disenchanted with their current system of beliefs they may seek something "better". Subjectively better but that's the point. So, to continue, there must be a social mechanism that promotes isolation if the belief systems are to remain "pure". That can quickly get into the realm of totalitarianism unless there is a signification geological barrier to promote the isolation. Looking at Earth, we don't have such barriers for a large percentage of the population. As a result, we see more totalitarian mindsets used to combat the spread to ideas. As example, see North Korea. So, yes you can make a world like you want. But you have to reasons as to why it's that way. Those reasons will tend to shape the world and its peoples. 

Yes a "fungal forest" is very possible. In fact, it is believed to have happen on Earth in the distant past. Before trees evolved there was grasses and among them large fungus. Some over 20ft high. As to what they feed on, well, I think you are on the right path with fauna, mega or otherwise. There would also be spots with vegetation, bushes on higher ground. The leaves falling from them to the lower land can also provide a little "food". It is all very possible. 

First, what's the problem with a tidally-locked world? Basically, one side of the planet will always face the system's star. That side would get very hot. The opposite side, being locked in a position of permanent night, is very cold. Let's not worry about how hot or how cold it is on the respective sides for the moment. The important point is that one of the basic laws of thermodynamics says, I'm paraphrasing here, that heat travels from hot zones to cooler zones. This will happen by whatever conductor(s) is(are) on hand. In this case, the atmosphere will do a great deal of work here. That makes wind. Generally speaking, the hotter the light side is in relation to the dark side, the stronger the wind will be. So, if you want to kill off those winds or at least slow them down on a planetary level, you have to do something about that temperature differential. If you have technology to terraform the planet then you could also, while you're at it, add a Solar Shield and a Solar Mirror to the mix. I would argue that it may even be easier to do that than try to build reliable protection from the winds on a settlement by settlement basis. In this case, the Solar Shield I envision is a circular mesh deployed at the L1 point. It would not stop all the light but it would block a percentage of it. The shade lowers the temperature on the light side. Also, a mirror deployed at the L2 point could reflect some light to the dark side. If the makers are smart about it, they would make these two objects complement each other. In other words, the heat energy blocked by the shield on the light side would equal the amount of heat delivered using the mirror on the dark side. Indeed, a step more along that line of reasoning would allow the devices a limited amount of "intelligence" and the ability to give the tidally-locked world real day/night cycles. So, the version 2 shield is not a mesh but a material that has two states, fully opaque or partly opaque. The control mechanism being how much of an electric current is running through it. This is similar to composite materials used today in high-tech windows of tomorrow. Version 2 of the mirror would likewise be covered with the same material but with a range of fully opaque to clear. That would allow the mirror to go dark as needed. With both devices in place, the light side could experience night while the dark side got day. Regardless of which versions you use, the end result is to bring the world's areas of extreme down to a more moderate level. That would help with the wind problem. With these great extremes the heat exchange, which is the source of the massive winds, becomes more moderate. That makes the winds more moderate. Now, I'd like to point out that success here may not cause the wind to cease completely. It is more likely to bring the winds down to a more manageable level. A level that would allow the individual settlements, at a much lower tech level, to build things that could survive the wind. 

In that way, with rain and streams and rivers flowing through it, it is far more likely that the area will not be prone to forming a desert. 

To my knowledge, there are no real stars that are "bad" stars. There are useful stars (used to navigate) and all the other ones. Before the advent of telescopes, any of those tiny lights in the sky would have been seen as "stars" so it may not matter if it's a planet or comet or a star so much. We draw a distinction between those things that this fantasy society may not have. What I'm getting at is your search for "evil" stars may be limited by what we think of as stars. As example, Mars. Even in ancient times, with the naked eye you could tell it was odd. It was red and it moved a lot more than most of the other little lights in the sky. It would show up in the night sky for a span of nights and vanish again, not to be seen for many more nights. When compared to other stars, it was magical in a way. But, at the same time, it is there enough that no long standing correlation can be made with evil events. To be called a herald or a portent or ill it has to be very strange and not much seen and then have some bad stuff just happen the last time it (or something like it) showed up. So the more common foreboding things are comets and eclipses (both solar and lunar). But there is something else that you may like. On August 6 in 1181 CE a whole bunch of people saw a light in the night sky bigger and brighter than any other star. Many of them feared it and said it was a bad omen. It wasn't a star, it was a supernova. It was there for six months. Yeah, people freaked out. After all, it could only be the end of the world. All that and they didn't know about the one in 1054 CE that remained in the sky for two years! We know of another half dozen supernovas seen in ancient times. Generally speaking, some people freaked out each time. Again, we draw a distinction that the denizens of your D&D world may not. We know those were supernova. To them it's a thing that no one alive (at least no human) has seen before, hence it can't be good. Expand your definition of star to include these supernova and you can have something to reference. Otherwise, I don't think you will have much luck. 

Well, I think you are OK up until it starts shocking the person. Thermal energy produced by the human body is not a huge source of power but it is something that is being explored today. As example, Dr David Carroll, Wake Forest University, has published research on this topic. I'm not sure how your device would gather this power. Having only a small area, the wrist, to work with would limit the amount of heat it can absorb and that limits the power it gains. However, there is nothing that says the power comes only from one source. I'd like to suggest some other possibilities. First, harness kinetic force. When walking, most humans will swing their arms in counter force to the movement of their legs. Have your device include a bit of hardware akin to a shake flashlight and the simple movement of the swinging arm could give some power. The shake light is just an example. A better example, pointed out in the comments by Joe Bloggs, is a watch powered by body movements or a kinetic watch. Your device would most likely have a more refined generator, it may not make a huge amount of power but it would help. Next, harness the power of flowing blood. Your device "has mechanical roots" and why would those roots not monitor blood flow? And while you're there, why not harness the blood flow? Researchers in Lucerne, Switzerland are doing that today. Just like the others, this isn't going to produce a lot of power, but again, every bit helps. Finally, looking to today's tech for inspiration. We have pads that you can drop your phone on and it charges the battery. You could extend that idea and give it range greater than contact. Power could be broadcast, transmitted, directly to the device. This may even be the main method of charging internal batteries with all the others providing backup/supplemental power. 

I'm going to take a stab at this. The heat generated by a nuclear blast can reach extremely high levels. We are talking about the kind of heat normally not seen outside of a star, 100 million degrees. That sounds like a lot! The one thing going for your frog is that it's a relatively a brief event. The blast's fireball takes about a minute to die out. Such a brief period may help. Also, as the upper layer of water vaporizes it will act as insulation for the water below to a small degree. With the amount of heat we are talking about, that may not count for much. But, coupled with the briefness of it all, maybe there is a chance. I don't think so, but let's do some rough calculations. As a caveat, let me say that thermodynamics is not my strongest subject. To vaporize a body of water takes about 5 times the energy needed to boil the same amount of water. In the case of water that's 2257 joules/gram. Converted to calories/gram, that's 539. One calorie is the amount of energy it takes to heat one gram of water by one degree Celsius. With that in mind it would take direct application of heat measuring 539 C to vaporize one gram of water. Next, how many grams of water are in the the pool? We don't know without knowing the measurements of the pool. Let's go at this from another direction, backward. We have in the area of 100 million C, so how much water could that vaporize, assuming it all gets transferred into the water. My calculator says, 185,529 grams which is 185.5 kg. Water's density is 1g/ml or 1kg/l. So, 185.5 liters of water would be vaporized. That's less than a cubic meter of water (1000 liters). It's also surprisingly small and promising (if my back of the envelop math is right), I didn't expect that and I'm not sure I trust it giving my amateur status with thermodynamics. So, if I'm correct, the heat generated may not be the biggest problem for survival. Next, we have to think about the force of blast. That's a harder thing to figure on the pool of water. There are so many factors. Location of the blast in relation to the pool. Terrain around the pool. So, lets look at it another way. The force of a nuclear blast will not only level unfortified structures but move the resulting debris with ease. The blast wave will last up to 20 seconds. So, how much mass could it move in that amount of time? Well a one megaton device could be equivalent to 4.18 x 10^15 joules. That's 4.18 billiards (yeah, that's what it's called). That's a heck of a lot of power. I have no idea how to convert that into numbers we can use. However, 850lbs of commercial grade explosives was all it took to blow a cement truck into tiny bits. One of those trucks is easily 10,000kg. I believe the explosives used were stronger than TNT however the details were not all shared, or if they were I don't know them. If we assume that the blast from that video was equal to 1000 lbs, half a ton, of TNT then a megaton device would have enough force to move 2 million trucks like that one. Just because we don't know the exact details of the explosives used, lets take half of that number. So, one million trucks at 10,000kg each. Ten billion kilograms of mass could be displaced by such a blast. Yes, that's a guess but I would call it a good one. Even a tiny fraction of that power, say 1%, would move a lot of water. From there we are back to details about the pool and it's location in relation to the blast and so on. Maybe this could serve as a jumping off point for others to add to. So, community, feel free to edit and add.
