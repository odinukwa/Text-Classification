I provided an answer before, but reflecting on this question further it occurred to me that it is not a problem even if there is no food. In Buddha's time there was a time when the monks could not get their supply of food from the residents. King Agnidatta forbade his subjects from giving alms to the monks. But a group of horse dealers was passing through that place carrying barley for horses. The monks survived for four months eating this food given to the horses. Once when Mara closed peoples' hearts against giving food to him, Lord Buddha spoke the following famous verse from the Dhammapada showing his power to obtain spiritual food from meditation: Happy, indeed, we live, We who possess nothing, Feeders on joy shall we be, Even as gods of the radiant realm. — Dhp 200 Remember well the Supreme Buddha’s words… “Dear Bhikkhus, ones who would not realize this Dhamma is like this earth (in amount). Ones who realize the Nibbāna is like this small amount of soil on my finger nail.” For true disciples who truly follow the Noble Eight Fold Path, food is of no issue as even the Devas / angels conspire to help them. Also read the article $URL$ if time permits. It is very informative in this regard. May all beings, wheresoever they be, taste of this truth. 

The fourth precept on musavada (lying) in Buddha Dhamma includes all abuses done my speech, including harsh speech, slandering, and gossip which will harm oneself and others. Thus the fourth precept encompasses all four akusala kamma done with speech. The Buddha said, “cetana ham Bhikkave kamman vadami“. Thus, what determines the type of kamma is the cetana. Cetana is translated sometimes as “intention” and other times as “volition”. “Intention” is one of the dasa akusala in the case of an akusala kamma. Intentions vary. For example, one may lie about something because of greed (lobha); another person may tell the same lie because of hate (dosa); the consequences are worse for the latter. The greatest negative consequences that one will reap when writing on Dhamma is when one “explains not-Dhamma as ‘Dhamma’ … Dhamma as ‘not-Dhamma’ … not-Vinaya as ‘Vinaya’ … Vinaya as ‘not-Vinaya’ … Buddha has described in Sangha Bedha Sutta (AN 10.1.4.7 – in the sixth book) that this is what is meant by Sangha Bedha – an Anantariya kamma that is one of the five heinous deeds which certainly bear results after death (as one is misleading another in this dhamma path). 

At the very outset of this post, may I make it clear to one and all that this is only an interpretation from a Buddhist Point of View, and it is not a criticism of any one of the religions that believe in a single all-powerful 'God' such as Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Nowhere in the scriptures is found a mention of ‘A God’, and it can be said that the concept of ‘God” is constructed by the mind due to the ignorance or "avidya" of "anicca, dukka and anatta". Because all things are conditioned and transient (anicca), the concept of ‘God’ too has no real independent identity (anatta) - so do not truly ‘exist’. Furthermore the mind that is being used to comprehend what is written here is also created due to ‘avidya’ or ignorance. What we are dealing here is relative truths, as opposed to Nirvana, Anicca, Dukka, and Anatta which are Absolute Truths that we will never fully comprehend. To make this point clear, let me take ‘Anicca’ that we have come to know as “impermanence”. Only an Arahant would fully understand ‘Anicca’. Whoever that realizes what Anicca, Dukka, or Anatta is will attain ‘Nirvana’ that very moment of understanding. So what we will ever know is kind of sort of what it is – or "rather," "partial," or "somewhat" of what it truly is. For the people of the world, the worldlings, of a bygone era, the Sun was the Surya Divya (Sun God). From a not so distant a past, thay have created a "body less" entity in the God, Brahman, Allah or Yehovah that has taken the place ‘Sun God’ and others. According to Buddhism, these entities are created by the ‘worldlings’ / ‘sattva’ and create more ‘samskaras’ in this very act, and extending their very journey in this endless samsara. The essence of Buddhism is the Four Noble truths. It is Buddha’s essential teachings aimed at ending dukkha in this very life, through the realizing of The Four Noble Truths. The essence of Dukkha/Suffering lies with the mind, and aging, illness, and death are its shadows. The ignorance of these truths is avidya or ignorance / unawareness. The Dharma, teaches that the essence of Dukkha / Suffering is clinging, and the most basic form of clinging is self‐identification. The Buddha advised us to seek to attain the state of non-returners. At least all should try to attain the state of stream-entrants in this very life. I may expand on this in a couple of months. This post is in response to @ChrisW & @Raymond comment & post. 

Te = three, hetu = cause, nirodha = nir+uda = stop from arising “All dhamma (in this world) arise due to causes arising from the three “san”s: raga, dosa, moha. The Buddha has shown how to eliminate those “san”s and thus stop dhamma from arising”. 

There are times in our lives that we may make negative judgments about ourselves and are at a loss at making positive ones. It may not seem easy to get out of a rut but we need to realize that we have what it takes to get out of such mindsets. We should have the willingness to look at what we’ve been doing. We have to realize that it is only our actions that have been unskilful. We must pass judgment on our actions, and not on ourselves. Even though our intentions and actions in the past have been unskilful, we are not stuck there. 'Isn't it nice to think that tomorrow is a new day with no mistakes in it yet? We can change our minds. We can change our habits. So let us use our sense of shame in a skilful way, to use our sense of judgment in a skilful way. 

Even if a follower of the Way attempts to improve him/herself through Sila (true morality), it is not possible if the pragna (intellectual and intuitive faculties) are not developed in him/her. Only pragna gives the force or energy with which one can confront the enemies that are of loba (greed), dosa (hatred), moha (delusion). That is why when talking about the Noble Eightfold Path, it is very common to group the 8 points under three headings, 1) panna, 2) sila, 3) samadhi. It is a gradual training. To understand this read the Anubuddha Sutta: Understanding – AN4.1, and Sakka Sutta: To the Sakyan – AN3.73, and Culavedalla Sutta: The Shorter Set of Questions-and-Answers _MN44 

I cannot seem to find in which Sutta this is said, but... The Blessed One said once: Bhikkhus, the world has been discovered by the Perfect One, he has dissociated from the world. The origin of the world has been discovered by Him. He has abandoned the origin of the world. The cessation of the world has been discovered and He has realised the truth. In the world with its deities and others, whatever can be seen, heard sensed and cognized or reached, sought out and encompassed by the mind, has been discovered by the Perfect One that is why He is called a Perfect One (The Thathagatha). The Most Enlightened. 

Another way to put your question (re-phrase) is... "Is criticizing other religions allowed in Buddhism?" If that criticism is fair and aims to correct others, then it’s allowed and is a good thing to do. As it is mentioned above in Cula-dukkhakkhandha Sutta, Jainism is criticized by Supreme Buddha. Supreme Buddha was one of the first crusaders against caste system, an apartheid evil ideology started by Aryans who used it to suppress indigenous Indian people. Lord Buddha was a social reformer and thoroughly criticized the animal sacrifices and discrimination of women which was common in the Hindu society. A heartfelt touching discourse of Lord Buddha on animal sacrifice comes in the Sutta Nipata, Brahmana-dhammika Sutta. In this discourse, it is discussed about the ethical conduct fit for a Brahmin. Lord Buddha speaks respectfully of ancient Brahmins who rejected disdainfully the taking of life and never allowed their religious rites to be contaminated by the blood of poor animals. But corruption came upon, and they started the wicked practice of animal sacrifices to please gods. When the knife was laid on the neck of cow, the gods themselves cried out in horror, seeing that crime of ingratitude and insensitivity committed on an animal that was such a faithful worker, such a sustain-er of life, to humans. In the Agganya Sutta, Supreme Buddha focuses on the Brahman idea from Wrig Veda that Brahmans came through the mouth of Maha Brahma/God; thus they are supreme. Lord Buddha questions the Brahmins as to how they can claim so when they see day to day that women in the Brahmin caste get pregnant, give birth, and take care of their children? Don’t they understand that they all came from the mother’s womb, not from the Brahma’s mouth? ‘One is not low because of birth nor does birth make one holy. Deeds alone make one low, deeds alone make one holy.’ – Supreme Buddha (Dhammapadha) 

Saddha has been referred to as the confidence towards the understanding of Supreme Buddha (Saddhahati Tathagatassa Bodhin). All of us must do everything possible to at least come to Saddha in this life. One cannot go the distance in this Dhamma Path without Saddha. Therefore we must cultivate right effort (Viriya), the will, to develop Saddha to receive the true benefits from Dhamma. One who has come to Saddha is one of Samma Ditthi (right understanding of the four noble truths). A worthy person. This is not an easy thing. Only a fortunate few would arrive at this. If we gradually but firmly establish Saddha in us and develop it, our Sakkaya Ditthi (the idea of self) leaves us. The Supreme Buddha preached that this is more delicate a thing than shooting one seventh of a horse hair with another seventh part of a horse hair face to face. A horse hair is taken for this simile because it is thinner than that of a human. To break free, to gain freedom from this notion of ‘self’ or Sakkaya Ditthi is even more difficult, but not impossible. There are many avenues that can lead us astray. But for Nibbana there is only one road. Only one guide.That single road is thinking that “Supreme Buddha knows. I do not know” (Keetagiri Sutta). The only safeguard for us, in keeping us safe from harm is our association with a Kalyana-Mitta (Noble Friends in Dhamma). On this ‘Noble Friend’guidance, Ananda, one of many principal disciples of the Supreme Buddha, once asked the Buddha if half of the reason for the spiritual life was friendship with others. The Buddha turned to Ananda, rebuking him mildly with the words, “Don’t say that, Ananda. The whole of the spiritual life is for friendship.” This shows that the Buddha elevated spiritual friendship to the highest status. If we regard ourselves as knowing the Dhamma well, we will be of the “I am the one who knows” mindset. Without allowing that to happen try to come to the view “I do not know. Only Supreme Buddha knows. I will accept it that way”. “I am the one who knows” can be equated to a Thorn Bush. It is like this. There is a bush of thorns at the bottom of a hill. When it rains fertile soil settles down round the thorn bush after getting washed down from the hill. The soil is fertile but what gets nurtured is the thorn bush. Like this it is the fertile soil of Dhamma that we gather round us. But what gets nurtured is the thorn bush called “I am the one who knows”. When the thorn bush grows up even an animal does not approach it. Will not go even passing it. In the same way the biggest danger to a person on arriving at the view “I know”. “I understand” is his becoming a person who does not listen. He loses his sincere friend. He loses his ability listen to Dhamma well. (He loses both external sources of help). Then what is he left with? Only with the notion “I know” and “I understand”. He keeps on repeating this. Finally he will say “No one taught me. I studied on my own. I do not need anyone now. I will become solitary now”. This is a big danger. Therefore you always think “Whatever Supreme Buddha taught I will do it in that way”. Think that you are the listener. What we want is to get released from Sansaric Sorrow. That is why Supreme Buddha preached to king Kosala as follows. “Oh Maharaja. This is how you must discipline yourself. I will become a person with sincere friends. I must get inclined to having sincere friends”. (Kalyana Mitta Sutta – Sanyutta Nikaya 01) When you think that way, the idea “I know” will wear off. Then association with sincere friends becomes delightful.One will always cherish the company of noble friends. One will get the opportunity to listen to Dhamma well. Yonisomanasikara (thinking wisely as mentioned in Dhamma) will arise. This person will develop the Noble Eight Fold path. This happens solely due to association with sincere friends. We must be humble enough to do so. If one cultivates thoughts of “Supreme Buddha knows…….” I am a person with sincere friends….” no one can prevent us from getting onto the path leading to Nibbana. Chakku Sutta (Okkanthi Sanyutta – Sanyutta Nikaya.03) Such a person is referred to as Sraddhanusari. He will not die until he attains the fruit of Sotapanna (the first stage on the path to deliverance) Supreme Buddha knows that the person with defilements is wrapped up in the idea of Self, is egoistic. Also that he is wrapped up in the concept “I know”. Some people struggle to understand this simple truth in depth. That is why it is important to think and retain in your memory the following “I will obey Supreme Buddha and conduct myself in the way he wanted us to conduct ourselves. I will not do anything else”. Getting back to the simile about the thorny bush. When it rains fertile soil comes down to the bush of thorns and it grows up in a couple of days. Ultimately it becomes too big to be pulled out. Sin is also like that. So we must pull out this thorny bush and plant a good tree on that fertile soil. The biggest thorn bush we have is the notion “I know”. The good tree we plant after uprooting the thorny bush is “Supreme Buddha knows. I don’t know”. These thoughts lift up the man to a noble level. If we are of the idea “We know” it amounts to our tightening our own necks. We read what Supreme Buddha has preached. Then we assume “I know”. Our sincere wish should be that such a thing will not happen to even an enemy. Therefore if we become humble in this manner we would have done something very much beneficial to our lives. The instant we start having confidence that way, Kammic actions, causing rebirth in the fourfold hells will not take place in us. So to further onself in the Noble Path, the thorn bushes that need to be gotten rid of are “I am the one who knows”. “I can” “I have memorized. Others aren’t up to it”. “I understand well. I can speak well”. You must not have room for these and discipline this mind saying “I will do whatever the Supreme Buddha preaches and whatever my sincere friend tells me to do”. The immense benefit of understanding the True Path to Liberation has come to us. It is a pity if we let go of it. Therefore let us all try our best not to leave room for those immature thoughts such as “We know”. It is because we do not have confidence that we say “this is impossible” etc. If we step into Saddha we will be able to end our Sansaric journey at most in seven births. Attaining Nibbana is not a dream. Think of establishing Saddha in these principles and think of getting liberated from this sorrowful Samsara. It is the nature of the person who has developed Sraddha in respect of these principles to endeavour to do it with mind, word and body. Then delight arises in him. Why? Because all his doubts leave him. When there are doubts he thinks “I do not understand. I do not know whether it will be possible” etc. The hindrances develop in him. Pleasant words, thoughts, deeds do not arise in him. His sense organs are not pleasant. Even the face is unpleasant. If the doubts are to be removed develop Saddha in these principles. Then he will think of the principles. Then he will live in delight. His thoughts, words and deeds will be beautiful. Even the facial expressions will be delightful. There will be no remorse, worries or difficulties in him. He will be inclined to help others. Such a group of people would be like flowers in a flower garden. He thinks of the good qualities of those who helped him. ‘Ingratitude’ will leave him. The instant he arrives in Saddha, gratitude arises. He meditates without difficulty. He attains concentration. When he thinks of these principles while in concentration he understands “this eye is impermanent….” It becomes a realization to him. Then where did we start? After pulling out the thorn bush called “I know” and instilling Saddha.
