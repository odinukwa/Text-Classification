I have a Google Chrome software install group policy object that works perfectly except when logging into the the Terminal (Remote Desktop) Services Server. It's configured under "User Configuration" in Group Policy. The group policy is linked to both my Employee OU, which contains the user account that is logging into the RDS server, and directly under the Domain, but it refuses to be acknowledged. Why? 

I have two AD servers separated by a T1. Location A, which hosts the primary AD / DNS / Roaming Profiles server is subnet 192.168.0 Location B, which is the secondary AD server (I'm trying to configure but...) is on subnet 192.168.1 I understand this may be a DNS issue. The only DNS server I have assigned to that subnet via DHCP on a Sonicwall is the AD server in Location A. I got positive results from DNS tests in ping and nslookup. I have joined, unjoined, rejoined the domain. All Event Viewer is telling me that the login is taking too long, it took 931 second, it's taking to long to log off, and there's a csc resource cannot be loaded... Is it simply that the profile is too large in size for the T1? I've enabled Folder Redirection - still taking forever, stuck at "waiting for user profile service". Note that this happens on both Win2k8R2 and regular Windows 7 in Location B. Now happening at Location A as well... [Possibly fixed - it may just be raw profile size, even with folder redirection on] What is the best way to troubleshoot this issue? 

I never had experience on that precise model but generally the answer to all your questions is YES for every nas like that. Even the last question should be yes because the nas should be capable to rebuilt the array from the meta information stored in the disk and also because a mirror raid is not that hard to be rebuild. If you extract a running disk you can mount it on another host (the filesystem used by Iomega should be XFS, so every linux can mount it). Bonus question: If I understand well what you mean, the action is SWAP. Hot swap is when you can exctract a disk without turning off the device. This Iomega is not hot swap. Apart this in the recent past (last 3 years) we sold 12 Iomega Storcentre nas. We had 100% warranty emergencies on them: broken disks, bugs in the GUI, broken power units. We stopped to sell Iomega for this reason. I don't mean that this model is affected too but I would suggest you Buffalo $URL$ 

Download PSTools from SysInternals. Unzip PSTools.zip and from the PSTools directory, run the command: 

The setup: Plantronics USB CS50 Headset > USB Port of "Thin Client" (Running Win Pro) > (Wireless) RDP to Remote Desktop Server > Eyebeam Softphone Client > VOIP Server > Caller (cell phone or another in-office extension) During a live phone call, the incoming voice (From the caller played through the USB Headset on the remote client computer) is all broken up and barely intelligible. The outgoing voice recorded from the remote client computer and sent to the caller is flawless. Any other audio playback is flawless as well. For example, the caller can call and leave a voicemail on the VOIP server and then the user can play the voicemail back through the headset on the remote client and it's clear as day. Is there anything I can do to improve the audio playback sound quality during a live call? Note: I am currently using "Play on this computer" versus "Play on remote computer" as the server does not have a sound card installed. 

We are working on a project which involves different hardware all hosted in a single rack. The machines are mainly IBM servers: 2 x206 (scsi), 1 x226(scsi), 2 x3400(sata) and another assembled machine with sata controllers. We are using several raid controller. Some machines have only one Serveraid controller, others have one or more controllers not always Adaptec ones. All the firmwares and bios are updated. All the servers and connected devices are under ups. Over the last 4 months we experienced several strange behaviours in our hardware. Suddenly and randomly we loose 2 or 3 drives and the raid volumes stop to work. It can happen once a week but never at the same time of the day or week. Most of the times a rebuild process fixes the problem, sometimes we loose the data. Very often we just need to unplug the raid controllers, restart the server and the problem is fixed. At the beginning we thought it was due to firmware bugs but we performed an accurate update for every machine and raid controller and there is nothing else we can do on the hardware. We have really no hint on what's causing all these troubles. We are starting to think that it's an environmental problem but we don't know if there could be something interfering with our hardware. Have you ever heard of something like that? Do you have any idea on how to investigate the problem? 

I installed the vCenter connector and it said "lol, can't upload VM with two disks." So I disconnected one of the disks and uploaded the VM and now I need to upload the second disk and rejoin it to the VM - if possible. I thought I might just attach the second disk to a new default VM and upload, but now import says "ClientError: No bootable partition found." What are my other options? 

I lucked out in the case. Upon writing this, the main disk was locked. I removed the VM from inventory and readded it - no good. I vMotioned the VM between hosts and noticed now the main vmdk (OS Drive) wasn't locked, but the ancillary swap drive. I disconnected that and started the VM - good to go. Powered down the VM, reattached the swap drive, 100% ok. These two sites were very helpful: $URL$ $URL$ 

I had more problems even after disabling RF Monitoring, but upgrading the Sonicwall to SonicOS 5.8.0.3 (which also upgrades the Sonicpoints) seems to have alleviated the issue. 

I have a X3400 with 8 x (43w7598 250GB SATA 3GB/S HDD) set in the frontal bay and connected to ServeRaid 8K controller. The raid array works well but, even if I set the controller PHY to 3.0 (rather then Auto or 1.5), all the disks negotiate 1.5Gb/s with the controller. This sounds really weird to me because the disk are WD Caviar Black Sata2 disks (bought from IBM). The firmware is the latest available from IBM (accordingly to the IBM ServeRaid matrix). Any tip? 

Unfortunately this is shown inside the terminal and I couldn't find any way to hit "ok" and then, of course, I get this message. 

The title should be self explanatory but more in detail I'm looking for a way to protect the ldap from LAN brute force attacks. It would be fine to prevent password guessing by locking a password for a specified period of time after repeated authentication failures. It doesn't matter if this can be turned into a DOS. Unfortunately I can't find a way to do this and the documents I've found are really confused. 

I have Folder Redirection turned on so the profiles are on a Windows shared folder on a File and Print Server... \folders\Profiles I want to back up the entire Profiles directory, but as Domain Admin I don't seem to have the privileges to "select all and copy" the entire directory structure. The user profile subfolders (Appdata, Documents, Desktop, Pictures, etc.) throw access denied errors... I tried to grant Domain Admins full privileges to the Profiles directory and thought the subfolders would inherit the privileges, but I get access denied errors just trying to set the permissions... How can I assign a user to the Profiles directory so that I can copy the entire directory tree to back it up? 

I have an RDS server with about a dozen printers installed. Is there a way to remove all buta few certain printers for a particular user? I don't mean that I want to "secure" the other printers to keep them from printing to them, but literally filter which printers appear in their available printers list. 

I'm looking for a 4 ports pci or pci-express (not pci-x) sata controller with these features: - real hot swap support - no RAID support, or with RAID support that can be disabled through the controller bios interface or reflashing the bios My need is to hot plug/unplug one or more different sata1 and/or sata2 disks from different brands size and speed (even at the same time), coming from my customers computers to perform lab activities on them, like backup. I tried several Silicon Image controllers (3112,3114,3124) and Promise TX4. Everyone has issues: some disks are not seen or are dropped during the backup process while the Promise even hangs the host pc with some hard-drives. Adaptec raid (Serveraid 8s) controllers aren't transparent to the operating system and it seems there is noway to disable the raid. What would you suggest? Thank you! 

I just purchased a license of safelyremove. It has command line support. It's very nice. There is a full trial on the website $URL$ 

the process gets stuck on the installation of libssl because it requires the user input to restart some services (ssh ntp exim4) 

I was copying a VM between datastores last night when I looked away and then the vCenter host started restarting due to Windows update... The VM transfer between was aborted, but now the VMDK file it was transferring is locked and I can't start the virtual machine. The Knowledge base articles I've found are too cryptic, I just need to get the vmdk unlocked... How? vCenter / ESXi 5.0 Error: "Unable to access file [NEXSAN_SAS] rds-sv-ent/rds-sv-ent_1.vmdk since it is locked" More Details: "An unexpected error was received from the ESX host while powering on VM vm-261. Reason: Failed to lock the file. Cannot open the disk '/vmfs/volumes/4f4bb0fe-f7daabec-6a41-ac162d73a349/rds-sv-ent/rds-sv-ent_1.vmdk' or one of the snapshot disks it depends on. " 

Another option - which I actually did - was to use ImageX to write an image of the second drive to the first drive, disconnect the second drive, import the VM with the vCenter AWS import tool and then add a volume to the imported VM and use ImageX to expand the image back to the second volume. Worked flawlessly! 

Is there anyone aware of someone seriously working on thunderdbird to get write support on ldap shared addressbook? 

Of course I can work around this by continuing the installation by hand through the virtualbox GUI but this should not happen in unattended installation. How can I force the installation process to restart the services without waiting for the user input? 

I use rsync v. 3.0.4 and when I need to move something I use it with the --remove-source-files. I prefer rsync than mv. Unfortunately, when I use --remove-source-files, the directories are left on the source side (as said in the man). Is there a way to remove directories too once moved all the files? 

In the bios interface of Serveraid controller is possible to set the PHY speed. Beside this there is a parameter called CRC check which can be set to true or false. Knowing this, some questions: 

The orange led doesn't mean that the drive is broken: it means that it's marked as failed. Recently I had the same issue on a ServeRaid 6i: two drives disappeared. The raid was level 5. I put one of the two online and I rebuilt the second. At the end of the process I got my array rebuild. Of course it was not a broken disk but a weird bug into the controller or into the disks. Some disks seem to have broken firmware that cause the disk to deattach from the array randomly. 

I have an ESXi host with the following virtual machines: 1 x Active Directory Server 1 x Remote Desktop Services Server 1 x SQL Database Server 1 x Accounting Software Application Server I have a second "blank/empty" ESXi host. In theory, what I wanted to do was simply schedule the VMs to be cloned the second host as a backup. If something happen to the first server, I could simply boot the VMs on the second machine and resume as if the first never went down. In practice, this seems a lot less practical having done quite a few searches here on SF. My main concern is the integrity and consistency of the SQL database... This backup strategy does not seem to be recommended for SQL servers due to unwritten data residing in memory. I suppose I could shutdown the server, clone it, then reboot, but in my perfect world, I'd like to duplicate these VMs at least nightly while still live. What would be the best backup strategy for replicating these particular types of servers to a second ESXi host nightly while they are still live? Consider separate options for a budget of $1,000 and a budget of $10,000. Is there a better possible backup strategy as a whole?
