Have you ever heard of "signaling?" Briefly, signaling is the concept that when we meet people, we have to make snap judgements about them based on external signals they provide. The car they drive, the clothes and shoes they wear, whether they are clean and tidy or rumpled, the stickers on their laptop (technology companies? Green Peace? Homestar Runner?), the way they carry themselves (good posture, firm handshake and eye contact? Slumped shoulders and staring at the floor?). In a job interview, the interviewer has a very brief opportunity to size the person up, and is looking intensely for useful signals. Content of resume, work history, school transcripts (especially for entry level positions), professionalism, etc. Anything that helps fill in the gaps of the mental picture of the applicant. If I was interviewing you for a programming position, and you had gaps in your work history, I would be concerned, because it sends a signal that says, "I don't need this job, and will leave when it suits me." I would wonder how committed you would be to the job, or if you would just leave during the inevitable (though hopefully infrequent) moments of conflict or office politics. I'm not saying it would disqualify you (although some might) just that I'd be very interested in getting to the bottom of your commitment to the job, and hearing you reassure me that you wouldn't be flaky. Why? Programming positions can be difficult to fill, and very time consuming to train. New programmers have a large body of work to familiarize themselves with, and people come to depend on you in order to accomplish their work. Often you have to form important relationships with people across the business (including, sometimes, executives from multiple areas). Financial self-sufficiency is great, but if it means you signal a lackadaisical approach to work, then you will need to convince potential employers that you are committed. 

Up to a certain threshold, professionalism is a matter of perception and, what matter the most, of shared perception between you and the company. What I mean with this? I mean that a company could think that the only way to be professional is wearing a tie, another one could think exactly the opposite, and there is no clear stats unless you work in some specific environments or countries. I've seen in companies that didn't care at all about how good you were at your job, what did matter was the tie. I've been a project manager and did interviews myself, and I discarded all people that presented with a tie or those that where totally freaking nerds 'cause it was a small company and the team was working with a certain kind of spirit. I've met a guy who is running a hugely successful company in Milano and he hire only weird, crazy, nerd guys. Every company has its targets and decided its way to reach them; at the same time, you as a human being have a standard of what you feel is comfortable for you and the environment you want to spend a lot of your time in. So what you should be asking yourself is: "Will I look unprofessional in the context of the companies/countries I'm going to work, and do I really care to work with them? Is it acceptable for me to change myself to adapt to a certain company?" You can put stickers on your laptop, knowing that some (rare, I think) companies could see it as unprofessional and will ask you to remove them, and you can just ignore those companies and choose the ones that are more in sync with you. Or you can mask yourself and not put stickers because you feel you want to work for that a company. You can do whatever you want, as much as it makes you feel good! There's a ton of job out there to choose from, so choose what makes you happy. 

They don't care what your career has been like, and only care what you're an expert on if it matches what they're looking for. Just tell them, "I can do it all. I've worked in a very broad range of programming languages, from deep programming in C++ and Perl to systems programming to web programming. I'm great with Java and even have worked with ColdFusion. I have both deep and broad programming experience, and I can do anything your client needs." 

The behavior you are describing is called "Phatic" talk, and it performs an important social function. Phatic talk is the reason people greet each other in hallways, and ask coworkers things like, "how was your weekend?" or "did you get your car fixed?" It's purpose is not to actually convey important information, instead it is a purely social interaction in order to establish acquaintances and maintain friendly and casual relationships. Ideally, Phatic talk (or small talk) should be easy for both parties, and not exceed either party's comfort level. It should not feel like an interrogation, nor should it seem stilted. Unfortunately, things are never perfect. For example, conversation is low-cost to extroverts (so much so that it can be thrown away on subjects like sandwiches), but can be emotionally expensive for introverts. Also, your guy has fallen into an annoying pattern that that requires mental energy on your part, and is irritating you. The solution is to recognize his questions for what they are -- Phatic attempts to socialize with you -- and change the nature of the conversation. Just like as an introvert you may feel uncomfortable in the social spotlight, us extroverts often feel uncomfortable spending time around someone who frequently is a silent, unreadable enigma. We feel like we must be doing something wrong, and need to try harder to find a common point of interest. He may simply not know what else to talk to you about, so he is using your lunch as a way to connect. (Or, maybe he just has a weird fixation with your lunch habits) Either way, your options are the same. You can: First, decline to answer the standard questions. When he asks you what you got for lunch, just say, "man, who knows. Some food, right?" Same answer for inquiries about the lunch special. Then, either redirect the conversation: "how was your weekend?" This will a satisfy the need for small talk, without having to give your lunch inventory. The risk here is, he will probably talk for a long time. Or, Close the conversation: "brotha, I'm tired and kinda want to just veg out on my phone. But I want to hear about your weekend later." The downside here is, you miss an opportunity to connect with a coworker, and may get a reputation as being cold. However, it's less-bad than simply answering him in an irritated tone (or not at all) because it establishes a boundary he can understand (reassures him that your silence is not his fault; it's just because you're tired). If your office has messy politics, it won't help you. Otherwise, it is probably fine. 

Just to add a different point of view (unless I've missed it in someone else answer) First of all forget for a moment the total number of sick days per se. 5 or 50, "too much" depends on the local culture, national culture, work field, and so on. As a former team leader in different Italian companies, for example, I'd never think of 5 days as "too much". So let's focus on something different: 5 sick days total for 4 event means that you got sick 3 times for just one day and 1 time for 2 days. I'd bet my debts this is what rang the bell. Scenery: you go to work, everything is fine, next day you call in for a sick day (it can happens, you can get sick overnight), you stay home, and just after a day you go back to work. You just managed to get a debilitating cold -so debilitating that you could not manage to go to work, and not even focusing on code- and then it magically disappears and you're happily back to work. Can it happens? Yes. Does it make sense? Very little, but human beings are weird machines, so you can never know. But can it really happen four times in a year that in 24 hours you go from perfectly fine, to mostly dead, to fully health? No, it cannot. And you wrote in your post that you are again ill in this moment, which means that you called 5 times sick in a year, which in itself is a...well, a lot. Side note: I'm a long time dev and I can write the same amount of bugs both when perfectly fine and when slightly ill; the same applies to all the colleagues I've worked with in my life, but you write that you get an illness that's so bad that you cannot even think straight. Now, it takes the average dev a decent illness to fall back that bad, and I still have to see a decent illness last less than 24 hours. Anyway, now the company needs an explanation and comes up with those four possibilities: 

I would smile and chuckle. After you left, I would share a laugh with the other interviewers, and even tell colleagues about the wacky interview. And then give the job to the applicant who wrote clean, clear code that anyone can understand, and explained it in a very approachable, comfortable manner. 

Your boss' concern is valid. Communication between dev leader and business stakeholder is a carefully curated, nuanced process that is both art and science. You cut him out of the loop on an important conversation with a business stakeholder. It puts him in an awkward position, and interferes with the trust and communication pattern he is trying to maintain. And he's (probably) right: if you had a conversation with her in person, she probably did sugarcoat a little on the parts regarding your performance. In future you should respect your boss' wishes on this matter. Some bosses might not care, but many will. Respect that. 

I would consider it bad faith to ask for a raise if you know you are about to leave. If you are on the fence, and a raise is the difference between leaving and staying, then it is not uncommon to try to leverage an offer to a raise. But if you know you are leaving regardless, then IMHO it makes sense to leave on good terms. 

This isn't matter of subjective opinion for which there is no objective answer. So all I can say is what I would do, not what you should do. If it was me, I would be honest and put, "all but one". If he asks, I would try to give an honest but neutral response, and pivot that into a strength. Something like: "Unfortunately it was a difficult working relationship in a challenging work environment. We both tried to get along, but could never quite sync up. To be honest, I made some missteps, and he did too. I really wish it had been otherwise, but I was too young and inexperienced at the time, and didn't quite know how to resolve the situation." "The good news is, I learned a lot from that working relationship, and have spent a lot of time and energy trying to make improve my soft skills so that that kind of situation never happens again. Every other manager I've ever had will tell you that we got along great, and that they would work with me again."
