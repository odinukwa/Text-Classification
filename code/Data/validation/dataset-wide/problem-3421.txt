-A World of Possible Futures: German Weimar Republic in the early 1920s and the U.S. - Troubling similarities The source itself appears to be of questionable value, but makes vague reference to: "The Economics of Inflation (Routledge Library Editions-Economics, 84)" by Constantino Bresciani-Turroni (427 pages, Routledge, reprint edition, October 1, 2003, first published 1937 Judging from historical gold prices and exchange rates, we could estimate: $$ 35M x 4.58 / 21.32 = 7.5M$$ So, 7.5 million troy ounces or 233 Metric Tonnes according to Google. To address your second point, it seems to be exactly what the Weimar Republic tried. I would not imagine the US would be keen to repeat something like that, though it seems far outside the scope of this SE to speculate on that. 

Because linear functions don't match the data. You can't express a series $$[1,2,4,9,16]$$ as $$f(x)=x+y$$ for any possible $y$. 

As Steven Landsburg pointed out, indefinite anything isn't possible given the eventual heat death of the universe. Von Neumann posited machines capable of indefinite growth in population (and theoretically production and consumption), so in theory, it would be possible for a time. Sagan's Response however argued if such things existed that we would have already observed them, and that they would destroy whole galaxies en masse. That's probably the closest answer you can get to a question like this. 

The Bureau of Labor Statistics Local Area Unemployment series of data provides monthly figures at the state level from 1976-2014 downloadable as Excel, CSV, or images. I looked into the following Series: LASST100000000000003 LASST100000000000004 LASST100000000000005 LASST100000000000006 

The model is a variant on penetration pricing (effectively $0 for pirates) which is used to gain market share. The problem is while monopoly may be desirable, the path to monopoly is generally not, as the cost to acquire market share rises relative to the value of each additional unit of market share. While there is no specific study of Adobe that I know of, penetration pricing and market share are generally well understood concepts in economics. That being said while the linked MIT paper implies an "uncanny valley" of sub-optimal over-penetration before a monopolistic (~100%) market share/maximal profit scenario, to my knowledge the empirical data on ologopolistic firms and cartels is scant, outside of the energy industry. Historically, however, OPEC and the Seven Sisters, have never actually combined to a monopoly, nor engaged in penetration pricing by giving away oil (again, to my knowledge). One thing that is agreed on is that a monopoly is only as valuable as the barrier to enter the market (broadly speaking). Combining those facts one could surmise that for Adobe to maximize profits they would need to choose a strategy that allowed for either: a) optimal penetration $$or$$ b) monopolistic dominance of an industry that would need to produce profit per year less than roughly the barrier to entry divided by the discount rate they erected through a combination of R&D costs and $0 penetration pricing strategies. $$P_{Total} < \frac{B}{r}$$ Monopoly of a more valuable market would entice a rational actor to break it and leave both in the sub-optimal valley of oligopoly (unless they colluded), hence the prevalence in niche technical markets you mentioned. Not to say graphic design is a small niche, but of the population at large they represent rouhgly 0.08% (at least in America). 

The closest I've come so far is the OECD StatExtracts, which gave me data in current USD. I'm still hoping someone can come up with something better. It took some fiddling because their MEI tables seemed to be wonky in chrome, and all I got was "an error occurred" until I start fiddling with the (invisible) table's layout. 

The first equation is dollars time interest over total dollars. For example, if a company wants to finance a project, issues \$1M in equity with an expected ROI to the investors of 6% and \$4M in bonds at 4%, it's WACC is: $$\frac{(4\%*4,000,000 + 6\% * 1,000,000)}{4,000,000+1,000,000} $$ which for simplicity we can say is $$\frac{(4\%*4 + 6\% * 1)}{4+1} $$ or: $$\frac{22\%}{5} = 4.4\% $$ As mathtastic pointed out, it means the project needs to exceed an ROI of 4.4% to be viable. The second WACC formula is assuming an average for debt and an average for equity, and then expressing the percentage of financing as debt times the average interest rate on debt, and the percentage of financing that's equity times the expected or needed ROI on equity to secure financing. They derive from each other because $r_i$ and $MV_i$ don't differentiate between debt and equity. 

According to David Ricardo's theory of comparative advantage, all regions should pursue specialization to an equilibrium point. Beyond that point it would not be rational to continue developing a given industry. That being said, many regions have seen their prosperity rise and fall as they "lost" their comparative advantage (especially in modern times as labor has no longer been considered the only factor input). More accurately one could say globalization has opened up trade with markets that have even greater comparative advantage that may be the result of cheaper labor as opposed to invested capital or natural resources, rendering many regions less productive. The American Rust Belt and Detroit spring to mind. 

-Wikipedia: Marginal Utility - The Marginal Revolution and Marxism Marginal Utility addresses the diamond - water paradox by explaining that the more of a resource or commodity one has ready access to, the less one needs access to even more. The declining marginal utility means that because water is nearly ubiquitous and easily accessed it has very little "value" per unit to an individual because they know they have access to many many units. "Modern" analytical Marxists, including John Roemer have built a strong foundation (if somewhat heterodox) based on the theory of marginal utility. 

The deciding factor seems to be whether Monetary Policy can offset short-term effects, thogh the Fed goes on to close with: 

The US has several taxes and several different systems of taxation. In brief, we have what are known as ad valorem taxes, and income taxes. ad valorem taxes are on the value of property held (i.e. real estate, though some others), and are usually collected by municipalities or states. Income tax is principally collected by the federal government according to the following brackets (For single wage earners, married, and others are taxed differently): 

Based on the 2010 US Census, Wikipedia has pretty much exactly what you seem to be looking for. A sample graph: 

From a political standpoint, debt is less contentious than taxes. From an economic standpoint, in a fiat currency deficit is equal to an increase in the money supply, and can be used as a bridge between fiscal and monetary policy to stimulate growth. As older debt retires, this could lead to a stabilizing, or even temporary reduction in nominal debt load. Lastly, externalities like decreased economic output during a recession would increase the debt to GDP ratio as depicted by those charts. 

I'm contributing to another open-source economics project, and was looking to compile a list of primary sources for modern developments in the field. Basically something to help bridge the (occasionally decades long) time lag between what's taught at an undergrad/ introductory grad level and what's being researched in the field today. Unfortunately as many in academia know, companies like Elsevier and others have most major publications locked up behind corporate paywalls, which makes them broadly incompatible with the principles of OSS/OSD. There's Arxiv (and Vixra for the braver), but preprint servers are not really what I'm looking for. It's hard to separate the wheat from the chaff on many of them. I'd like something with some editorial content, and especially peer-review. I'd appreciate any suggestions. 

Question Why is that? Is there a flaw in the reasoning, or were the effects simply not visible at the scale I've looked because the data was too volatile or confounded by external factors. I'd be interested in any studies that dealt with this topic and offered potential causal mechanisms for breaking the presumed link between (again, the presumed) increased efficiency, and output growth. Thanks! Sources: 

Are there any de facto standards when publishing, or is there substantial latitude in deriving one's own methodology? I understand in practice, even the St. Louis Fed is gently skeptical of the validity of most technical methods, but I was wondering how academia viewed them. While Dooley and Shafer (1976, 1984) were largely dismissed, Neely and Weller (1999) seemed to fare fairly well using genetic algorithms, and Markov and ARIMA methods are reviewed more or less favorably in terms of predictive value. Is accuracy of prediction (and consequently profitability) even necessarily a factor in modelling for academia, or is the simplicity and explanatory value more heavily favored?$^1$ $^1$*Note: Not sure if this merits a separate question, or can be answered as an elaboration of the primary*

Which you may notice is not an explosive growth. For more information on this, I'll defer to the experts at the Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs, and their technical paper Cause and also Cause Lastly, you're assertions rely on the assumption that increased population means food prices go up. But that's not how numbers work. Prices are denominated in currency. More people (without a correlating rise in currency), actually means there's fewer dollars per person. In that scenario, food prices would go down (although probably slower than wages), leading to shortages. Price is a way of rationing scarce resources, but it's not the only way. The other way to ration is queueing, or shortage. This is what we see happen in developing nations. Rice is not more expensive, there just isn't enough rice there. If everyone only has \$5 a rice merchant can't charge \$6/lb, or he won't sell any. An Inflationary Theory In the event that the population increased, and central banks also increased money supply, than standard economic models would predict that the prices of all commodities (not just food) would rise, since the relationship to amount of quantity over the amount money would have changed, or roughly $$\rho (\Delta P_n, \Delta \frac{M_0}{Q_n})>0$$ where $\rho$ is correlation, and $P_n$ and $Q_n$ are price and quantity of $n$ respectively. Of note, there is some disagreement o whether $M_0$ or another measure of money should be used, but prices in the US (as measured by CPI) have a substantial correlation with $M_0$ ($\rho = 0.46$ for $M_0$ as compared to $0.086$ for $M_1$ from 1985-2013)$^3$ This would be conformant with standard economics, and not reliant on a Malthusian population collapse. The only way we would expect prices to rise dramatically without central bank intervention would actually be after the collapse, as people accumulated currency, and would trade more currency for food. TL;DR In the event of a zombie or post-nuclear apocalypse, cash will decline in value relative to commodities, so stock up on rations and bullets because dollars won't help.$^4$ References $^1$: Korotayev, A.; et al.

I've done some more digging, and I'm adding this as a separate answer: This search of Roper Center data from UConn yielded a few interesting surveys. Namely, this CBS survey from 2013 and this PRRI survey from 2011. Both track income data and are rigorously documented. Lastly there was this report entitled Americans on Climate Change from 2004. Digging even deeper, I found this report from Pew from 2000 with a few questions on climate and a measure of income. I did not download the whole report though, and just perused the pdf, so your mileage may vary. I did however just want to call both datasets out for being invaluable (much better than Gallup), so if there's more info you'd like, definitely peruse The Pew Research Center for the People & the Press Poll Database or the Roper Center Public Opinion Archives 

It's called a Principal-Agent Conflict. The RIAA/MPAA act as agents on behalf of the people who actually produce content (and consequently end-consumer value). To maintain relevance to their principals', the RIAA/MPAA must signal value to them (i.e. claim loudly and repeatedly that they do something good for them [regardless of the validity of that claim]). Firstly, this signaling is demonstrably an example of the Principal-Agent problem, in that it diverts resources away from actually advancing the principals' interests, but more so in that it creates a perverse incentive for lobbying groups to fight imaginary fires. The impact of piracy on the broad economy is believed to be near zero, so IP laws are effectively just rent-seeking $^{[2]}$ anyway. Whether or not that particular type of rent-seeking is always a drain on the broad economy (in that it distorts markets producing deadweight loss in excess of the externalities corrected) is up for discussion, though it is known to be possible (insofar as the existence of an optimal tax [or government induced market distortion] is necessarilyy proof of the existence of an excessive tax). 

When people talk about the size of an economy, they often refer to the GDP or changes to it, but seldom refer to the Net National Wealth. Obviously there are some superficial differences: 

Short Answer: Probably. For some goods. I guess. Longer Answer: Assuming two toy economies and three goods, increasing the supply of good in one economy relative to the supply of goods of the other two classes will decrease its trade value relative to them. Prior to the transfer (at $t_0$) they'd look like: $$E_1(t_0)=\{a_1x,\ b_1y,\ c_1z\}$$ $$E_2(t_0)=\{a_2x,\ b_2y,\ c_2z\}$$ with basic prices of $x$ in $E_2$ as: $$p_x(y)=\frac{a_2}{b_2},\ \ p_x(z)=\frac{a_2}{c_2}$$ in that it if we started with $a_1=4,$ $b_1=8,$ and $c_1=16,$ then one unit of $x$ would cost either $2y$ or $4z$ in $E_1$. After the transfer (let's say of good $x$ of quantity $a_t$ at $t_1$, they'd look like: $$E_1(t_1)=\{(a_1-a_t)x,\ b_1y,\ c_1z\}$$ $$E_2(t_1)=\{(a_2+a_t)x,\ b_2y,\ c_2z\}$$ consequently in the recipient country ($E_2$), the price of good $y$ in terms of $x$ would have declined to $\frac{b_2}{a_2+a_t}$. But, with a rational expectation of future gifts of good $x$, the value of $x$ in $E_2$ should also be diminished (or price of a good in terms of $x$ increased) by the NPV of the perpetuity times the probability of default at each payment, though we'll skip quantifying that for now (and merely assume it's positive and non-zero), and simply say that at $t_1$ in $E_2$ the price of $y$ in terms of $x$ is: $$p_x(y)>\frac{a_2+a_t}{b_2}>\frac{a_2}{b_2}$$ and the price of $z$ in terms of $x$ is now: $$p_x(z)>\frac{a_2+a_t}{c_2}>\frac{a_2}{c_2}$$ So as long as $x$ is currency, under the classical regime, any increase in the quantity of $x$ will decrease it's relative value in terms of the other commodities in the economy. Still Longer Answer This simplistic explanation over looks a few key factors, and can be expanded on by including basic international trade. If $z$ is a fungible, non-perishable, and easily transported, and both economies have relatively free trade, then we have another story. In that case, members of $E_1$ and $E_2$ would presumably have access to all the $z$ in each other's markets, so the price of $z$ in terms of $x$ would be globally set, and remain unchanged, since in the aggregate, the supply of $x$ has remained unchanged. An Elaboration on Regulatory Dynamics Further complicating this, however, would be any regulatory trade inefficiencies, like tariffs. Let's say $E_1$ has a tariff on the export of $z$ of $q\%$, then prices of $z$ are likely to rise in both $E_1$ and $E_2$ as the supply of $x$ has decreased in $E_1$. Since the ratios of $z:y$ should also remain unchanged if $y$ is not traded in this example, then prices of $y$ in terms of $x$ would also have to increase. One would assume that given that their relative scarcity ($\frac{b}{c}$) hasn't changed from $t_0$ to $t_1$ (before and after the transfer), the ratio of their prices hasn't, or more formally: $$p_{x_{t_0}}(y):p_{x_{t_0}}(z) = p_{x_{t_1}}(y):p_{x_{t_1}}(z)$$ should hold for both $E_1$ and $E_2$ Transportation and Storage Costs Of course most consumer spending is on consumable goods (funny how they got that name), which are generally neither free to ship, undifferentiated, or truly non-perishable. In fact, in aid recipient nations, the percent of GDP that is spent on household consumption is often larger than the total GDP, precisely because of foreign aid, although speculative debt buying in developing markets has historically also been something of a problem (See Carbuagh International Economics [citation needed]). What this means, is that there would be a price gradient sloping upward away from the border into $E_2$ and downward into the territory of $E_1$. The magnitude of the slope would of course be proportional to the ratio of $a_t$ to $a_1$ in $E_1$ and $a_2$ in $E_2$ Ricardo and Comparative Advantage Given the relative production rates of goods $y$ and $z$ in the different economies, the prices in real currency might fluctuate away from even the trade influenced prices, as the relative supply of these goods changed inside their respective economies. Further, the country most efficient at producing one or the other of these goods would probably specialize, thereby reducing the price of that good at home in terms of $x$, and increasing the price of the other. Inflation Of course the Monetary Base can also increase in either economy, as represented by a growth in the quantity of $x$, further confounding the relationship of $a_t$ to the function $P_x()$. That is, assuming of course both countries are currency issuers as opposed to being part of a larger monetary bloc like the EU. Currency Issue Of course if our toy economies are not issuers of their own currency, or are part of some more restrictive monetary bloc, they may not have the ability to control inflation as easily. Banking Regulation Of course $MB$ represents only a fraction of $M_0$, which is itself only a fraction of the total Money Supply ($M$), which in our toy economies would be the respective values of $a$. Consequently, an injection of hard capital into $MB$ could have a wildly disproportionate affect on $M$. Since classic inflation is linked to $M$ through the equation of exchange, or $$M * V = P * Q$$ Differing Local Preferences vis-a-vis Utility Functions and Environmental factors We touched briefly on logistics earlier, but haven't really dealt with the fine-grained details of differing marginal utility. For simplicity's sake, we can use the example of ice. If we were to assume on of the goods (let's say $y$) were ice, and the recipient economy was a desert, and the donor a frozen tundra, then you could see how purchasing more ice than could be consumed between stimulus payments (in $x$) would not be beneficial. This would mean the recipient economy would not likely see a large increase in the price of ice, unless there were adequate technology to mitigate the risk of spoilage, although that would still increase the cost of preservation, which would put downward pressure on demand. However, if the roles were reversed, and they could just leave it sitting outside, then there would be. Other confounding factors
