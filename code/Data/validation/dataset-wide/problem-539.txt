So, 11 speed groups are great, but as everyone knows, they are old news and manufactures are constantly innovating and upgrading to sell "this year's" new parts. 11 speed has been around for a while now and I was wondering if any of the big names are developing a 12 speed group? Are there any freehubs that could support this? Personally, I wouldn't rush out to but one but it seems inevitable. 

Depending on the geometry of your frame, the noise could very well be caused by cross chaining, especially if you have very short chain stays. If you've ruled out rubbing, and this is in fact the problem, you don't have many options unfortunately. You can pick a cassette/crank combination that ensures you spend most of your time riding in the middle of your gear range with the chain line is as straight as possible. For most road riders this means picking up a compact crankset and pairing it with a comfortable cassette. 

The CAAD 12 uses sealed cartridge bearings which are replaceable and not proprietary. You shouldn't need many special tools to service the headset bearings, especially if they are new - you should be able to tap them out and remove the necessary parts with a screwdriver or wedge. However, if you are asking the question because you are concerned with home serviceability, you will need a press to do any work on Cannondale's BB30 and BB30a (CAAD12) bottom brackets, which need service more than the headset. There are videos out there of people doing it without a proper press, but it's risky. Below are some pictures of a sealed headset bearing removal, similar to the CAAD. Also, there is a picture of a makeshift press that you could use for servicing the bottom bracket, if you don't want to spend an exorbitant amount on the park tool BB30 press. 

What is the make/model of the bike you are considering? It may help in answering your question more pointedly. There are all carbon forks (which are very expensive), and more commonly, carbon forks with carbon fork arms and an allow steerer tube. I think you will find the carbon fork much, much better in terms of weight, performance and comfort compared to an alloy fork. Most entry level road bikes ($700 and up) from the big brands come standard with a carbon fork. Road touring is more or less the same. I have an older Specialized Secteur which has relaxed touring geometry and some touring affordances. It came with a carbon fork and I wouldn't want to ride it without one. As far as durability, it all depends on the built quality, but I think you'd have to try pretty hard to actually crack a carbon fork while touring. I've hit massive potholes and never damaged my fork. I've blown out a lot of tires but the fork remains in tact. They are very durable. I'd be more worried about my alloy frame failing from fatigue than my carbon fork. A touring consideration, If you want to mount racks or fenders, you need to make sure the carbon fork has eyelets or some hardware to do so. It is not advised to use p-clamps on carbon forks. So, if you can afford it, I wouldn't think twice. Get the carbon fork. It will steer and handle better, be lighter, and you can pick up the front end of the bike easier (like when hopping your front tire over obstacles to avoid impact). For me, once I put some carbon on my bike, I usually and up wanting more carbon on my bike. It just has really suitable characteristics as a bicycle material. 

You're right, you want to space it between the shell and cup. You can put spacers on either side to get the chainline right. Most cranksets come with spacers (2.5 mm is probably the most useful size for you) but if yours didn't any LBS should have a few to sell you. Something like this: $URL$ (I don't know if these work with hollowtech BB's or not) You'll probably want to get an assortment of sizes if you can, and use as few as possible to get things lined up (I assume this would help maximize BB stiffness, but really I just hate having excessive spacers - makes it more likely I'll lose one when disassembling/reassembling). 

So I decided to take the plunge and try the tubeless wheels. I've got about 80 miles of road and gravel riding on them now, and figured I should start formulating an answer. I ended up using the stan's alpha 400 rim because of my weight and the lack of rim brake compatibility in their cross specific rim. So far it's been as advertised. The tires can run at much lower pressures than I was able to run with tubes, to the point that if I come back onto the road I actually feel like the tire is going to tear off the rim when taking tight corners too fast (these are corners on neighborhood trails and such, it is not nearly as pronounced when riding on real roads). The lower pressure lets the tires hook up really well off road - probably not as well as a wide set of tubulars but much better than the tubed tires I've used in the past. So I would say yes, there are significant benefits. There are a few gotchas to be aware of though, namely the lack of tire selection - the tires I wanted to run would not lock into the bead. Even at low pressures they would blow off. I ended up going with a set of (non-tubeless) continentals that my shop had lying around. It took a while for sealant to permeate the tire, but they are working great now. I think there are only a handful of tubeless specific cross tires at this time, but feel certain more will be coming. With the alpha (road wheels) you also need a special rim strip (in addition to the yellow tape) for higher volume cross tires. With some tires this is not needed (or even detrimental), but it ended up being needed for mine. I'm sure you could jury-rig something but I would just plan on spending another $40 or so on these strips (just a rubber strip with a valve stem built in). I've been told this is not needed with the iron cross rims. All things considered, I think it was worth the hassle so far. The stans wheels are great - very stiff when cornering, and I saved almost a pound at the rims off what my factory wheels weighed. I will come back and post more once I've done some singletrack riding and a race or two. edit - so I've done some singletrack riding and one race, and now I'm really starting to see the benefit. The stans wheels don't really allow super low pressures (I burped at about 22 psi while preriding the race course) but they feel great at 30. This is for a 220 lb rider with 35mm tires, using the rubber strips. The wheels hooked up really well on the slick grass course, and held up well to dismounts/remounts. At this point I'm ready to call the experiment a success. Looking back the only thing I would have done differently is go with a tubeless-specific tire (it took a long time for sealant to sufficiently permeate the non-tubeless tires I used). 

On every helmet I've worn there is always some extra length to the straps that run through the buckle that secures the helmet to ones head. Most helmet's these days come with one or two small rubber rings or something similar in which to loop the extra length on the strap. Is there a better way to do this than the ways I've tried? The most obvious way is to simply cut the slack off but I'm not really after that. I'd like to see how others finish their helmet straps to be the most comfortable around the neck and the least intrusive. Below are pictures of: 

As mentioned in some comments, many cranks will fit. You need a 30mm width spindle crank. BB30, a cannondale staple crank size, is just this. You can use a 24mm crank with an adapter. Some cannondale riders I know have all their bikes set up like this. I don't really like it. Extraneous parts and more weight. The advantages are serviceability and possibly less creaking, though I've never had a problem with this. It's more serviceable because you have a threaded bottom bracket that's easier to remove. (Most home mechanics don't have the proper bearing pusher/pullers to remove and reseat BB30 bearings correctly, though I've seen it done). Sram is what I use in my cannondale and I'd recommend it. I'm sure BB30 cranks from other manufactures are just as good. The bike came with an FSA crank, but I didn't care for it because it is comparatively heavier and less stiff than my Sram Red BB30 crank. Here are some pics of what it looks like in the frame: 

How often should one disassemble one's headset and service the bearings, assuming it's a fairly new road bicycle with sealed cartridge bearings and is ridden every day? 

I'm wondering if there are any advantages to mounting ones water-bottle on the bottom of the down tube, near the ground, versus on top of the tube. I'm mainly interested in the advantages, or lack thereof, in the context of a road riding. It seems like if you are riding a mountain bike or riding off-road, it could protect your frame from stumps, branches, or anything else that you could land on that is taller than the bottom of your down tube. Also, I could see it helping to keep the center of gravity of the bike as low as possible, for mountain and road. Are there any other advantages to mounting a bottle on the bottom of the down tube on a road bike? 

So I have a wheelset that I really like, only problem is the first time I rode the wheels a nipple came off the spoke when I launched off a speed bump going downhill. For a long time it was silent (the nipple must have been stuck in some stan's or something) but recently its come loose and rattles all over the place when braking. I am pretty sure this is going to drive me crazy. Looking for strategies that people have found successful for getting a nipple out in this situation. I figure if worst comes to worst I can take the tire off, remove the valve core and put a dab of rubber cement in the rim that will hopefully catch the nipple. But I'd like to fish it out if I can. 

I've briefly ridden A23's on a road bike, and while I think they'd be OK for cyclocross I did find them a bit flexy (I am ~220lbs). I've spent significant time on the delgado cross rims, and I found the A23's noticeably less stiff. I think you'd want something a bit beefier for singletrack riding, especially if you are hard on wheels. In your situation I'd probably want more of a mountain bike rim that's skinny enough for the cross tires than a road rim that might be strong enough to stand up to mountain biking, but imagine the lack of good mountain bike options with v-brake compatibility does make the road rims more attractive (along with their light weight). Guess this all depends on your weight and trails you ride though - I'm a pretty heavy guy and ride in eastern PA where we have a lot of rocks/roots. A lot of people seem to like the mavic open pros as a 29er rim and they don't look much beefier than the A23's - I always assumed these folks weighed 120 lbs and were riding really smooth singletrack but I guess I could be wrong. If sticking with Velocity, maybe the Dyad would be more up your alley? They look a bit like A23's on steroids.
