Without being able to scan in the page (or pages) in question I don't know if I can give you a definitive answer. The Table of contents of the book does list that dinosaurs are discussed on page 28. If you page through the book, it is a very, very skewed view of pretty much everything in there, slanted towards the creationist viewpoint (the preview only goes to page 5). I suppose I could waste the $3.30 to find out, but this level of silliness is not worthy of a single penny from me. A christian site itself repeats this story. Remember, the level of absolute denial of evidence and (I will opine) crazy required to accept literal creationism is probably foreign to most people. The lengths of the lies they will go to to promote their bronze age fairy tales sadly do not surprise me in the slightest. Sadly, there are kids in Louisiana (and other places) that do get lied to on such a grand and gross scale (yes, they even deny nuclear fusion is happening in the sun...). This interview discusses some of the "finer" points of this type of education. 

The exact opposite is true. Short version: Abstinence only does not delay sexual activity in teens, and when they do have sex, they are unaware of protection, thus leading to higher incidence of pregnancy and STDs. The Center for Research and Education on Gender and Sexuality mention that advocating a position of abstinence doesn't significantly alter the behaviour, and is highly detrimental because the behaviour is not modified by any relevant knowledge of safe practices. 

There's also another side to this, door to door salesmen, lost partygoers and drunk tourists seeking help might be more likely to be shot dead by householders in the USA. "one would much rather that twenty guilty persons should escape the punishment of death, than that one innocent person should be condemned and suffer capitally." - Sir John Fortescue's De Laudibus Legum Angliae (c. 1470)

Update: In a comment below, Oddthinking points out that the video referred to in my answer is not the video referred to in the claim. One explanation of the video in the claim is that the makers of the video in the claim may have simply used the description of methods provided by the makers of the video referred to in this answer. I would delete this answer but it may have some tiny value in illustrating that Youtube videos are not "indisputable" sources of truth. 

So it may be that Churchill's views on peacemakers were markedly different from what you might understand from the Spanish phrase. 

Now, if your friend has suffered from germaphobia since a young age, if the hygiene hypothesis has any merit, I would wonder what his allergy status is. 

Of course, know how to conduct a survey still doesn't prevent people from intentionally skewing results to their favour, or against an opponent. Even amongst (political) polling organizations, some do have perceptions of being more or less reliable. One group suggest a series of 20 questions one should ask to determine if a poll is scientific. They are: 

So, I wanted to put this out there, but will come back to this in a bit if I find more sources to corroborate. 

Although, soldiers aren't mentioned. And of course, these are deaths due to accidents. Suicides, drug overdoses, and the like attributed to the "27 Club" are tracked under different methods (such as the CDC). In a cursory look at that data, it doesn't seem like there is anything particularly different about musicians. As Jader mentions in the comments, the average death rate for people in the 25-34 age group is about 1.7%. Now look at the "27 Club" that is listed on Wikipedia. That's 45 of them in over 100 years! According to the labor bureau, there are currently 186,000 PROFESSIONAL musicians in the US for 2008, with a 10 year delta growth of just over 14,000. If anything, the 27 club seems to be UNDER represented on the wiki page if it can only find 45 in 100 years! Also, consider that the $URL$ link gives deaths for the 25-34 age category under accidents at a higher 12% rate! I think it could be argued that most of those deaths also involved some level of "accident" such as overdose, suicide, etc. I refer you to the answer by Sklivvz. 

Yes he did (if we believe the BBC, CNN, Xinhua and several newspapers). He later retracted his comments.

The brain is part of the CNS so it is nonsensical to write of creating a bond between them. The pineal gland's activity is primarily affected by light not by sound. 

We've seen above that Tesla claimed 99.5% efficiency. I haven't read much of the Colorado Springs notes, I have the impression that his demonstrations didn't measure efficiency of power transfer. I believe his "World System" was intended to work on slightly different principles. In a 1927 article Tesla contrasts his system with power transmission by short wave broadcasting.

That does not seem to be a generally accepted view. There is evidence that crop-farming was carried out in the Bronze Age in Britain. 

The act says that warranties must be "conspicuously designated" as either a Full Warranty or as a Limited Warranty. I believe the terms of the act mostly apply to full waranties. I note that makers tend to advertise "powertrain warranties" etc rather than "full warranties". (example) See FTC advice for more on "Full" vs "Limited" warranties and other aspects of the act. A powertrain warranty can be either full or limited (as defined in the act). "Parts" A consequence is that vehicle manufacturers must be able to provide parts during the term of a warranty (if any) made at the time of sale. They need not make or stock these parts themselves. Vehicle makers could choose not to do so, but then they would be required to provide a replacement vehicle or a full refund of the vehicle cost. In practice it is usually more cost effective for makers to procure replacement parts to effect a warranty repair. A further consequence is therefore that replacement parts are also available to people who do not have a warranty claim. "10 years" It is unusual for auto warranty periods to exceed 5 years. Most are shorter. credit: Oddthinking in comment below "Manufacturer" The act does not mandate that manufacturers provide warranties, dealers/retailers could provide warranties, the terms of the act would then apply to those dealers/retailers not to the manufacturers. "Auto" The act applies to all consumer products, not just to automotive vehicles. 

I am not sure where you are hearing or looking for statistics to assert that airbags don't help if someone is buckled in. My very first google result was from the National Institute of Health, in 1992 already had good statistics: 

This article also lays out some interesting information with some great links to follow up on. Again, the data indicates that abstinence only is a bad idea all around, and actually contributes to the problems of unwanted pregnancies and STDs which both programs state they are trying to prevent. As I mentioned earlier, most of the abstinence only education programs are not motivated by evidence, but rather by ideology. As The Journal of Religion and Society reports: 

Ask Pat Tillman. There is an entire Military Association of Atheists and Freethinkers too. And then there is me (although I wasn't ever in a foxhole, I did my combat from 30,000 feet). The saying comes from a misconception or personal projection that great stress will cause people to retreat to something comfortable. I can personally state that in combat situations, any "thought of deities" would have resulted in me dying as opposed to actually doing the job at hand. Austin Cline who writes numerous essays on this at about.com says a few things about this 

The "beauty" of a conspiracy theory is that no matter what evidence is presented, there is a "talk around" for the believer. No matter what answer is given, they will have a more conspiratorial rebuttal for that. To suggest that HAARP is anything beyond "an ionospheric research program jointly funded by the US Air Force, the US Navy, the University of Alaska and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). Its purpose is to analyze the ionosphere and investigate the potential for developing ionospheric enhancement technology for radio communications and surveillance purposes (such as missile detection)." without anything to go on is a great hallmark of "making stuff up." AS REQUESTED: Info about HAARP and what they do. 

The non-Christian historical references mentioned above are all significant. What we need to understand first, though, is that there is no contemporaneous or documentary evidence for the existence of most ancient figures. That's the nature of our historical sources for the ancient world. So if the question is "Do we have good historical evidence that Jesus existed, the kind of evidence that historians take as conclusive when they're doing ancient history" then the answer is a clear "yes." One difficulty with the way the question is posed here is that it rules out any evidence coming from Jesus' followers. But that's not good historical method. For a relatively obscure figure from a backwater Roman province, the only sources you will find for the first several decades will come from the figure's own circle of followers. What we find is that within two decades of his death we have first- and second-hand accounts of Jesus' life and references to Jesus as a real person. (Paul writes in the late 40s and through the 50s AD.)[1] It is important here that Paul and the other early Christians writing within living memory of Jesus don't treat his existence as a focus of argument or as something to prove. They display no defensiveness about it. Instead, it is just taken for granted both by Jesus' followers and by his detractors.[2] This early evidence, then, seems widespread geographically (Paul in the Eastern Mediterranean, Peter and James the Just in and around Jerusalem, John perhaps in the Ephesus area of Asia Minor)[3] and is uncontested by contemporaries. I find it particularly telling that Paul doesn't need to argue for Jesus' existence when he writes to the new Christian communities in Rome around AD 58. Paul clearly didn't found the community, has never been to Rome, and (based on how much of his teaching he has to defend in the letter) is regarded with some suspicion by Roman Christ-followers. Most scholars think that teaching about Jesus was brought independently to Rome by Jews returning from pilgrimages to Jerusalem or some similar informal route.[4] Even so, Paul can take for granted their agreement that Jesus existed and was crucified [5]. But we also need to look carefully at Tacitus and Josephus. Tacitus is writing in the second-century, true, but he is a meticulously careful historian. When he encounters dubious or unsubstantiated rumors, Tacitus is very clear with his readers that the evidence before him is suspect. So it is significant that Tacitus (less than a century after the events) does not signal any doubt. As for this passage being a Christian interpolation, there is no reason to say that except for prior doubts about Jesus. There is a danger here of "rigging the deck". If we dismiss evidence (without internal grounds) as fabricated, then what evidence could possibly be accepted? No, Tacitus is a very strong witness, even if he was writing two generations later. The so-called "Testimonium Flavium" by Josephus, on the other hand, is certainly the victim of Christian editing (for the reasons discussed here in other answers). But the general consensus among historians is that there was an original, neutral reference to Jesus here in Josephus that has been expanded and made more pious by later Christian scribes. I'll leave aside the detailed arguments here about the "seams" in the passage itself.[6] More convincing to me is the fact that there are so few references to Jesus in early historians. If Christian scribes (who preserved all of these classical sources for us through late Antiquity and the early middle ages until they were "discovered" in Constantinople by Arab Muslims) did not make a habit of injecting references to Jesus everywhere, then we should be careful about assuming that this reference in Josephus is pure fabrication. What Christian scribes did do, though, is add to and elaborate on references to Jesus in "secular" sources to make them more pious. If that is what happened with Josephus, then we do have a non-Christian historian writing within living memory of the events about Jesus as a real figure. (Despite the suggestion in one answer above, there is no evidence whatsoever that Josephus was an "Ebionite" Christian. The authority mentioned for this idea (Whiston) is a 19th century translator of Josephus who was making the assertion on the basis of the Testimonium Flavium, which he assumed was genuine in its present form.[9]) I am a biblical scholar and historian (PhD in Religious Studies from a secular public University in Canada, now tenured faculty at a Canadian Seminary). Every year I go to secular academic conferences to present and hear research papers from around the world. Arguments from consensus are dangerous, since the majority can easily be wrong. Still, it is significant that I have never met a colleague holding a faculty position in ancient history at a University who doubts Jesus' existence. This is certainly not because of public pressure (some of the same people are deeply iconoclastic) but because the evidence satisfies all the reasonable standards that we can expect for 90% of the ancient world. Anyone who spends her/his time working with ancient history comes to recognize quickly that the evidence for Jesus' existence is very good. Those who continue to question Jesus' existence are consistently people without academic training, whose work hasn't passed the peer review process that helps to maintain rigour. It tends to be journalists, documentary makers, amateurs writing a blog, or (at most) academics whose training is in an entirely different field (not in ancient history). My point is not that the historical academics couldn't (in theory) be wrong. It's that historians (even those much more skeptical than I) recognize that the existence of Jesus is as well attested as we can usually hope for in the ancient world. If we doubt Jesus' existence then certainly we must doubt, say, Pythagoras who left no writings and is only described by much later writers.[7] There is also much better historical evidence for Jesus than for Gautama the Buddha, who was not treated in "outsider" accounts for much longer than Jesus.[8] The trick, of course, is the term "verifiable" in the question. If one is looking for the kind of evidence that gives us measurable experimental data in the physical sciences, then no we won't be satisfied with the evidence. But if that is our standard we lose most of the past. The first Skeptics (of the post-Plato Academy) understood that we live in a world where the best we can usually do is probability, but that this doesn't make evidence or the degree of probability insignificant. So maybe what we can say is that the probability of Jesus' existence is much, much higher than the probability that he did not.

When you write "most highly skilled aspects of the decryption process" you are probably thinking of cryptanalysts, not the more mundane (though vital) work of people why typed ciphertext into Enigma (actually British Typex) machines using settings/keys obtained by the cryptanalysts. Decryption is trivial by comparison with working out the key. Many of the jobs, though skilled, did not require knowledge of cryptanalysis.

Note the years. Having a remote base like Groom Lake allows for that (as well as other extraordinary security measures). As for the physical location, it is well known, and before the government took control of "Freedom Ridge" people could even photograph parts of it. Also, you can request information from the DoD as long as it isn't classified. It exists, and again, for what the USAF is doing, the Wikipedia article is generally accurate. That is not to say that there aren't projects going on there that no one really knows about. We may be developing some sort of micro-UAV, or a high flying persistent ISR platform, UCAV, or whatever. What one can say with confidence is that there are no "mystical" or extra-terrestrial artifacts there. The evidence against those items are supported by the whole of science. And keep in mind, any government project is most likely not limited to just one location. There will be things that can only be tested at other places (like the McKinley Climatic Hangar). And some basic science may come from AFRL in Kirtland, Wright-Patt, or wherever. Any DoD program will by definition involve a much larger operation. 

For instance, concerning the god of the bible, or koran, I consider myself a gnostic atheist because that god has failed every claim made in those books. However, if someone starts talking about a deistic type of deity, then I must admit that I am an agnostic atheist, because such a god hypothesis doesn't materially affect our universe in any way, and as such there is no testable criteria to put that hypothesis to. Now, in regards to your specific question, let's have some fun! Lets go to a website called "god and science" (a christian apologetic site). They introduce their page by saying:
