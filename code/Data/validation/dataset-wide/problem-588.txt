As @Argenti Apparatus said, it is crucial for tires and tubes to keep them inflated. Additionally, if you cannot hang it, at least change the tire - floor contact point by rolling the wheel. Protect rubber parts from the sun - keep the bike in the shade or cover it. You can also spray it with i.e. silicone compound for rubber parts. Clean and grease your chain. There is often enough humidity in the air to make not oiled chain to corrode. Make sure that bearings are greased. If not - repack and grease. I would personally oil brake and shifting cables. Use proper bike lock or even thick chain that you would not normally use and check periodically against theft issues. 

Brake cable should go through gap in a screw, that is locked with a nut to the holder, connecting cable pulled by the lever with, as you called, helper. Sometimes a gap for the screw in holder is not circular. If you mis-oriented screw against the hole in holder, it rests outside the hole and does not tighten the cable. Please, add also the photo of the screw that holds brake cable on the brake arm. It looks like you have to unscrew that screw, pull more cable and then tight it. Also put a bit of oil on the cable where it goes through circular element. I strongly advice reading article on adjusting cantilever brake. In short: 

Some cities debate about letting 2-wheel wehicles (bicycles or motorcycles) enter bus lanes. Why should (or not) we let them enter? When it is ok to let them use bus lanes? What factors should be taken into account? What kind of evaluation should be made? 

In my area there are several possible consequences. Financial fines are most obvious, for minor law infringement. For serious offences, especially drunk driving, one, when caught, will be taken to court and banned from right to cycle for some time, and for breaking that ban you risk some more severe consequences. Few years ago it was even more strict: for driving drunk, using any wehicle (including bicycle) you could lose your driving license for all type of wehicle. Really. When, for instance, someone, as a result of your behaviour on the road, will have to swerve or slam on the brake and that will cause collision, you will be forced to pay for damages and, if there will be some injuries or fatalities, you risk trial and inprisonment. 

The mounting point is Thule ezHitch axle mount, so maybe it is an old Thule trailer. You can check al local dealer. But... I suppose it would be expensive to get that this way. All you need is metal tube you can get in DIY store. Undo rivets, drill holes as on the old one and you're done. Local locksmith service should do it for you for reasonable price. 

You can prepare it when you're in warm place. I think it should be just an addition to regular lights, but this is kind of solution for you. Note: assure that regulations in your area allows you to use on-body lamps. Last idea, in my opinion the best one, but also the most revolutionary - move to hub dynamo powered, permanently mounted lamps. 

Since at least 1998 in unkempt, secluded place in Warsaw, PL, there was an unofficial downhill track. Between the bushes some youngsters constructen on their own ramps etc. Between september/october this year users of that place decided to talk to the authorities to mark this track (at their own, private expense) and make its legal status clear. Our authorities said not only: "No", but within single month wiped everything away, claiming that this is just a piece of rubbish, that is also unsafe, not compliant with local plan, entacted in 2000 (but that plan can be seen as "dead", within 16 years nothing has been constructed, there are wild trees, trodden paths, a lot of rubbish and one official pavement/stairs to the 1944 Warsaw Uprising monument). No will to consult, no will to discuss. At present: 

Equipped with roller brakes and internal gear hub will be reliable, easy to handle and cheap in service. After @Criggie comment It is for sure more expensive than city bike with hamax seat, so you have to consider possible profits and savings. Even if the price is comparable to decent road bike price, it is the same situation as comparing Porshe 911 price to Scania truck. First one is for sure nice to drive, but Scania beats Porsche, when it comes to fulfill your requirements. It is not worth to buy such if it will be used just from time to time. But then a preferable option is to join/set up local cooperative. Read more here: MokoVeloCoop. Text is in polish, so making use of Google translate might be essential. 

The length of same braking hose should not influence braking power. The material that hose is made from can influence braking power and/or modulation. If braking hose is poor quality or damaged, it can swell, expand. As a result, your braking pump has to push liquid not only to push brake cylinder, but also to fill enlarged hose volume. 

I have this battery-powered tail lamp. It has one button to switch on/off and, when pressed for few seconds, probably "lock" lamp, which indicates this by flashing 3 times ("unlocking" procedure is the same). I'd like to know how to activate movement / light sensor on this lamp, in which it's probably equipped with. It has also some kind of battery level indicator, which I'm not sure how to interprete. User guide for this model would be appreciated. 

If your rear light will not come with standlight function, so (in the options I know) the front light with standlight will not "turn it on" at the rear light. Such lamp is AXA Echo 30 Auto Steady. It has cable to connect it to the hub dynamo connector and output for the rear light. But don't get misleaded. This output only transmits current when dynamo is powering the lamp. At stop there is no output and the front light then consumes the power accumulated in supercapacitor. You can prefecty use non-standlight taillight in this configuration, but it will turn off immediately after stop. To have rear standlight, buy one with that option. I strongly recommend battery powered, dynamo controlled light. Current from cable turns it on, but after that it uses batteries and more power can be transmitted to the front light, resulting in stronger beam. Batteries for led taillamp should last for several months, but when emptied, taillamp will be powered by the dynamo, so still working. 

@armb's assumption may be true. They stopped making IGH's and dynamo hubs for the same reason, at the same time. I-light had such a small market share that it didn't even earned to be mentioned. 

It is possible that you put not enough torque on axle nuts. The axle moves in the fork. If there is enough space, add some extra, broad spacers and then screw it back to the frame. Use this kind of spacer (it's from Sram I-3, might require some drilling) 

Except treating trailer as a single unit with its own lock (capable of locking at least one wheel and the frame to bicycle stand) there is something more you can do as an additional protection. Inspired by the way some car trailers are secured to the car hook, I recommend finding a way to complicate unauthorized detach. If your trailer use Thule ezHitch axle mount or similar, you can find a way to make hard to take the cotter out (custom cotter with padlock eye) 

Poland bike - a vehicle up to 0.9 m width, up to 4.0m length, powered by the rider's muscles; bicycle can be equipped with a pressure activated pedal auxiliary electric drive supply of voltage not higher than 48 V with a rated continuous power of 250 W, the output power gradually decreases and drops to zero at speeds above 25 km / h; "bicycle trolley" - the same as above, with width more than 0.9 m bicycle must be equipped with: 

In Poland "BSO" term is not widely recognized, nor used. This site is the very first place I've encountered it. I guess in non-english speaking world the situation is similar. If one will translate this term to polish, taking into account cultural context, it would be "wyr√≥b roweropodobny", what, when translated back, whould mean: "bike-like product", "bike substitute product", "fake bicycle", as we had "fake chocolate", "fake cheese" and so to describe cheap substitute of some goods. This term is not widely used. What is widely used as equivalent of "BSO" in Poland is "rower marketowy", what, generally speaking, means: "bicycle from supermarket". The polish translation of "bicycle" whould be "bicykl", BUT this word is rather old fasioned and obsolete. We use word "rower", which comes from polonified name of british company "Rover" owned by John Starley, that were exporting its early production here in 1885. 

The problem is for sure in your shifter. Make sure both levers can move freely at any gear (i.e. are not hitting against brake lever mount or other accessories). Also make sure that your shifter's inner mechanism looks fine, parts move freely. If not - consider lubrication. Disconnect cable from the derailleur, take shifter off the handlebar, shift to the lowest gear and try shift 7 times up. If you can't so the only option is to replace it to proper 7 gear shifter. 

While using IGH hub it's good to learn pedal repositioning technique different from freewheel hub. You may observed that when bike is pushed backwards, the pedals also go backwards. Of course, at junction there is not enough distance to go back enough to lift your favourite pedal to position convenient for start. But you really need centimetres-long distance to adjust your pedal as needed, taking advantage of engagement mechanism inside. do: Push back your bike a bit, that pedal lifts a bit. Keep pedal with your feet from below, move few centimetres forward. Repeat. It can be done without coming off the bike. But best practice is to learn positioning your pedals as you wish before you stop :) 

At first: tell us what is the brand and model. Secondly: was this hub ever disassembled, serviced? Was it ever working properly? What @RoboKaren and others stated, first thing to go is to check adjustment. Check if you have right model of shifter for your hub. For example, Sram T3 shifter and Sram I3 shifter looks similar, but they are not interchangeable. Statement that Shimano does not sell spare parts for its IGHs is not generally true. At least in my area some parts are available online: Nexus 7 parts. What is not available for sale, can be available for authorised bicycle service. (question is if this is profitable to fix such hub). My advice is to try adjust hub on your own, making use of web tutorials. On failure, contact lbs to do adjustment for you (check opinions online which of lbs specialize in ighs). From my experience, having such hub fixed by lbs is usually too expensive, comparing to cost of second hand wheel or even new hub. If above procedure will not bring it back to work, just treat it as broken. Then, if you're familiar with practical stuff, make use of web (dis)assembly instructions and with no fear open it and try to figure out what is different than schema shows. Here you have manual for Nexus 7. Check page 8 and see how important are small things, easy to overlook. And, before you try to fix it. Now you have partly working bike. You can end up with bicycle that cannot be ridden. Weigh it up. You can first search for second hand wheel with working hub, even lower model (ie T3, SG-3c, etc).
