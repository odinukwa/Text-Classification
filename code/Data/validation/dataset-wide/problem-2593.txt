I somewhat agree with your concerns and your reasoning. In theory, a monk should have enough insight into lay life, from both their own life before becoming a monk, and from movies and interaction with people. However in practice, I think someone who became a monk early in their life cannot have the same depth of experience with normal life, so their appreciation of the challenges and difficulties may not be enough to provide a convincing advice. Personally, one of the reasons I actively participate in "normal" life, as opposed to ordaining as monk in any tradition, is because I want to be able to relate to people and have a first-hand experience of all the typical problems: relationships, parenting, house-holding, career-building, work relationships etc. My goal is to apply Dharma and learn to live in peace within these situations, so I can teach others to find that peace, having attained it myself. This is a very Mahayana-spirit approach. In Tibetan Buddhism especially, it was not untypical for lamas to lead semi-normal life, complete with a spouse, children, and maybe even a small family business like farming or sheep herding. My goal, as a Mahayana evangelist, is to promote a lifestyle in which lay people could find inner peace and social harmony through application of Buddhist insights and values - without disrupting the normal fabric of social life but rather transforming its attitudes and values from within. In my view, the dominant ("western") paradigm of personal success should get transcended in favor of a new paradigm, one based on the values of maitri/metta: altruism, compassion, humanism, tolerance, acceptance, love. The only way to promote this, in my mind, is for each of us to implement it in our own lives first, without quitting society, and then spread to our children and people around us. 

I think I more-or-less agree with your "mind is like software" position. Here is my personal opinion on the topic. If you read modern books on mind, such as "Consciousness Explained" by Daniel Dennett and "Mind: A Journey to the Heart of Being Human" by Daniel Siegel, you will see that modern researchers are slowly getting to the same idea: Mind is an empty (non-solid, impossible to reify) informational phenomenon. It's existence depends on dynamic processes of information exchange. In this sense mind is not dualistically separate from its various media, it is the informational aspect of everything, built into the fabric of regular things. In this sense, "everything is mind". In my opinion, the comparison of mind with software is fairly accurate - although mind is even more subtle and amorphous than even software, but yes it is of the same kind. Mind is not just the thoughts, memes, books and other human stuff though. In a more subtle way mind exists in animals, trees, and even in geographical features. Mind as dynamic property of things moving, transforming, reflecting, affecting, conditioning, and representing each other. I would not say mind "emerges" from matter though, to me that's an incorrect characterization. In my view, mind is what animates matter, it is the "spirit" or "soul" of things if you wish (metaphorically speaking). Mind/information/energy is the active side of things, while matter is only a temporary form that it takes. Now, whether it matters for Buddhism or not, I think it does matter. The materialistic or nihilistic position declares primacy of matter and downplays importance of information and (abstract) energy (of latent influences and potentialities). The position of naive spiritualism is really an extension of materialism, in which "soul" and "self" is some sort of special cloud that resides in the body and leaves it at death (and more elaborate versions of that). Both of these positions lead to interpretation mistakes about reality and life. Materialism leads to "it does not matter" attitude that ignores all subtleties and critically important sideeffects. Naive spiritualism leads to a conservative kind of thinking that fears scientific discoveries and advances and basically rejects reality in favor of superstitions. In terms of ethics, this way of thinking has potential to finally reconcile the religious and the scientific positions, and the two camps of people identifying with them. The mainstream understanding that mind is not confined to brain but instead is like the atmosphere that we all share should lead to important breakthroughs in our ability to connect, share, appreciate, respect, accept, and love each other. 

How to mitigate the negative karmic effect of killing Generally speaking it can't be done. Don't kill. Tell your teacher you're a Buddhist. However, if in this particular case you have made up your mind on killing... At least you can cleanse your own mind. Please perform a Bardo Deliverance ceremony for each insect. Exact details don't matter, what matters is your sincerety, so you can make up the exact ceremony yourself. Should be at least 20 minutes long per insect, first stand on your knees and talk to each insect, explaining why you have to kill it and what benefits it will bring to the world, and asking forgiveness from the insect and the future generations of its children, not to be born because of you. Make it clear that you don't think that you are better or higher than the insect. Then, after you kill it, talk to it again and promise a swift rebirth in a pure land of Tushita, where it can listen to the teachings of Maitreya. Describe what it will look like to live in Tushita heaven and tell the insect how awesome it will be to learn directly from the great Bodhisattva. Make a vow to the world, that through the power of your compassion these promises will actually come true and they will. Say thank you, to each insect individually, for being your teacher at the moment and giving you this lesson on interconnectedness. Have a clear understanding that at that moment the insect is in fact a representative of the Dharmakaya, teaching you. If other people happen to see you, don't hide. Explain that you are a Buddhist and relay to them the outlines of the ceremony in broad terms. This should seed enough good seeds to offset the negative effects, in this particular case. This is an overall scheme. Like I said, what matters is your sincerety. Feel free to improvise and elaborate. 

My father was an alcoholic, and I suffered a lot of grief from him - so I might as well try and answer this one. The way my first teacher taught me about this (back when my father was still alive and I still encountered him a lot) the circumstances like this come from our karma, specifically from our attachment to decency and spirituality. The more we are attached to decency and to spirituality, the more we hate people who are indecent and lowly, the more we will have to face them. So the only way to stop this particular kind of painful circumstances, is to drop the attachment to decency and to spirituality, by no longer putting decency and spirituality above love and above existence itself. This was the teaching method my first teacher employed, very effective. The way my last teacher taught me about this, long after my father passed away, is that in such cases freedom comes from forgiveness, understanding, the intent to stop the chain of suffering. We should understand that family issues are passed down the chain, although not necessarily in the same form. When father has certain issues, the child will have certain other issues - that will affect lives of their children and so on. Even my father's behavior was not his own, he inherited it from his childhood family - his father was a very violent guy, a commander of a penal military unit, a place where the criminal soldiers served. Behind a violent alcoholic there is often a hurt little boy. This is important to understand. So these are two lessons from my Buddhism teachers, one is to let go of attachment to decency and spirituality and abandon hatred and aversion based on them, and two is to understand your parent's own background and suffering. As to what to do, I think the best way to work with such people is as if you were working with a child. No matter how adult they look or pretend to be, if they act like that they are still immature, far from it. So working with them like you would with your own child, with tough love, compassionate but strict, seems to be the best course of action. 

Did you try Trungpa's Transcending Madness: The Experience of the Six Bardos? Another Trungpa's work that touches similar topics is Glimpses of Abhidharma: From a Seminar on Buddhist Psychology 

Such a substance already does exist, it is called Camellia sinensis also known as ... regular tea! This traditional drink of Zen-Buddhist monks stimulates the mind and enhances one's ability to stay mindful, without causing intoxication or carelessness. 

According to my teacher, the reason we learn Five Skandhas and the phenomenological mode, is to detach from the original "view" of the world, to stop assuming that our interpretation is reality. In order to facilitate this detachment we learn a different "view" (also known as "the raft") - the view of Five Skandhas etc. As we practice Satipatthana and get in the habit of maintaining this phenomenological view, we detach from the original naive view of the world and learn to control our mind. But this second view is not the ultimate reality either! It is only a provisional tool, designed to help us overcome our naive attachment to the first view. Once we develop enough insight, we realize that all views are just that, views, or interpretations - and none of them can be called primary. This liberation from all views, in practice, not just conceptually, leads to emergence of a new way of perception/cognition that in some sense can be called "multidimensional" or "transconceptual". This transcendental perception is immune to reification, immune to attachment, and therefore immune to any sense of conflict and suffering. Finally, to answer your question: with achievement of that transcendental perception, "the raft" is no longer necessary, so the Five Aggregates model is no longer relevant or applicable. We could certainly come back and say that Raw Stimuli remain more or less the same, that Feelings are no longer attributed to an external object, that Notions lose their solidity, that Memory Imprints are purified, and that Interpreted Experience is transcended - but this would be dragging ourselves back into confines of a view. So in this sense, Five Aggregates disappear, or are recognized as "empty": 

In Mahayana Buddhism, they assume that everyone is already a Buddha. Enlightenment (bodhi) is self-existing, it is our natural state. It is our true nature, our primordial face. The only problem is, we got alienated from it, lost connection with it - but only at the superficial level. Deep inside we are always enlightened, all we need is to connect the layers and remember. So when someone attains enlightenment, they see everyone as enlightened already. They also see the confusion, or the illusion of confusion. And that's what they help the others to overcome. It's like, you wanted to become free from slavery and you thought the only way to do that is to become a king. But then you realize that this sort of thinking is still a slavery thinking. You realize that in fact we're all already free, that slavery was a lie that we believed in only because of ignorance. But as you go around on your white horse helping others get this, some may mistake you for a king. And then it's up to you to either tell them the truth, or to play a king for their benefit, like an adult playing Santa for the sake of kids. 

In my opinion, "resort" is a bad translation for (literally, something other things rest on) -- a better option in this particular context would be "apex". Compare with following simile from Milindapanha: 

Two thoughts, not particularly Buddhist, but coming from Buddhist experience... You may consider this inspired by my practice and the teacher's instructions... One, regarding "the bad dream" experience. This sounds like a clear indicator that the town in the north is not your place in life. In my tradition we are taught to trust our intuition. Specifically, we believe that your life and your path should be bright... Perhaps difficult and full of effort, but not gloomy. If you feel like you're having a bad trip, that's enough of a reason for change. Two, regarding your mom. It is pretty typical for moms who had difficult lifes, particularly had issues with their male partners, to form strong attachment to their sons. This works well for both sides for a while, but may turn into pathology over long time, if not checked. Most people who went though similar scenarios, would tell you should start separating from mom, even at the price of hurting her and yourself in the process. It will be for better long term, I think. All in all, it sounds like you have come to the same conclusions yourself already, so all I can do is provide validation. It sounds like you're very reasonable and have good connection with your heart, so keep trusting yourself and going on your own path and you'll be fine. As for causing pain to people... Sometimes we can't avoid it. As much as we would like to be perfect, we have to pay the price for the individualized existence. Accepting our inevitable contribution to the pain of others is a humbling experience and, in my opinion, makes us more humane. 

In Buddhism it is recognized that mind is not static, it's not like a lense that can be focused. Mind is something that unfolds, moment after moment. If you sit down and watch your mind unfold for a while (an exercise called meditation) you can notice that the state of mind flows from current to next through its associations in memory (plus distractions from the senses). One simple way to achieve concentration (after calming down and reducing inner and outer distractions) is to condition this associating process to come back with questions and thoughts about the same "thing", instead of it coming back with other related topics. Basically, you can keep asking yourself questions about the object, and for each question instead of answering from memory you should come back to the object and reexamine it. This is not really a one pointed concentration yet though, just regular meditation on a given topic. To achieve real one pointed concentration you need to shift attention from object itself to the image of object in your mind. If you look very carefully, you can see that the image of the object in your mind is never complete, it only has one-two elements or attributes of the object at any given time, not all at once. In fact, if you pay attention you can see how your mind is hard at work assembling the experience of the object from its multiple attributes by cycling through them. If at this moment, when seeing this cyclic assembly process, you shift your attention from the image of the object to mind itself, while letting it continue doing its assembly thing, you will have achieved one-pointed concentration.
