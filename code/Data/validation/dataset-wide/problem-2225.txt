I can speak to athletics/track and field, the sport I sometimes cover. Most events at a professional level and NCAA events at the national level require athletes to pass through a "mixed zone" after competition. This is (usually) a divided space with athletes on one side of a barrier and reporters on the other. This is where post-competition interviews happen. At major international events (e.g. World Championships, Olympics) there are distinct sections of the mixed zone for TV, radio, and written media. This often means an athlete like Usain Bolt will have done multiple TV and radio interviews before arriving at the written press mixed zone. In cases like this the athlete is often removed to a press conference room to answer questions in a larger setting. In smaller meets, it's up to the reporter to buttonhole the athlete they want to speak to, although there is often a meet media manager on hand to make sure reporters speak to the athletes they want. There are no formal requirements of the athletes, although talking to the press is an unwritten aspect of professionalism and good agents/sponsors will encourage their athletes to do so. The athletes, who have just completed a sometimes-grueling competition and are sometimes disappointed in their performance, can be unmotivated to talk and will escape if they can. On the other hand, there are classy athletes who respect the role of the press and will stand and talk as long as there are questions, regardless of their disappointment and/or fatigue. And winners are almost always easy to talk to. I've almost never run in to an athlete in this sport whose etiquette while speaking to the press is questionable, but that's not to say it doesn't happen. 

A local pool hall features weekly 8-ball and 9-ball double-elimination tournaments, and the different tournaments are described as: 

There is a cross-country skiing event this year at the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics called the skiathlon. Apparently, this is a race that was formerly called Pursuit. What differentiates this event from other cross-country ski events, and what was the reason behind the name change? 

The Olympics has strict rules against advertising on uniforms by athletes of all sports. These are outlined in the Olympic Charter, Rule 50 (Advertising, Demonstrations, Propaganda). This rule covers all sports. On clothing and accessories worn during participation "no form of publicity or propaganda, commercial or otherwise, may appear...." There is an exception for identification of the manufacturer of the equipment, but even this is limited by rule. According to the official Guidelines Regarding Authorised Identifications for the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympic Games, the manufacturer's identification on bobsleigh and skeleton helmets is limited to 15 square centimeters on each side of the helmet. Often in competitions other than the Olympics, you will see the athletes wearing helmets with sponsors prominently displayed. However, I don't think it is true that, in the Olympics, bobsleigh helmets are always plain white. This is a photo of Shauna Rohbock and Michelle Rzepka at the start of the bobsled run at the Vancouver 2010 winter games. 

Of course, there's a lot of variation between trail shoes, just as there is in regular shoes, so there are exceptions to all of these. But if you were to take a regular running shoe and make it into a trail running shoe, these are probably the changes you would be making. 

The fundamental reason for Kipchoge's time not "counting" as a record is the nature of the Breaking2 project. Speculation about the possibility of a sub-2-hour marathon in the past focused on the various factors outside human potential which limited previous times. The Breaking2 project aimed to minimize these factors and reach for a best possible performance, and in the process knowingly discarded several conditions required for a record: 

In short: Kipchoge's remarkable clocking definitely redefined what's known to be possible. But aside from covering the same distance, it didn't have a lot in common with what we consider to be a "marathon", and some of those factors made it impossible to certify the performance as a record. 

The IAAF doesn't have a formal editorial style guide for the relative use of these terms, so in practice they're interchangeable as Ben Miller answered. I'd be interested to see if there are similar synonyms in French and Italian, as French is also an official language of the IAAF and their primary statisticians are English and Italian. As terms of art, the two words are often used to distinguish when an athlete appears on e.g. an annual list multiple times: Bolt might have six performances in the ten best for a given year, but for other athletes down the list, only their best mark is listed. In other contexts, e.g. a field event which is ongoing, an athlete might have three existing marks "on the board", but their performance will be the best of those marks when the competition is completed. But I wouldn't want to suggest either of these as rules which are followed rigorously. 

As a result, it is not likely that we will see motorsports in the Olympics in the near future, although there are a lot of motorsports drivers and fans that would like to see these events included in the Games once again. 

A Baltimore Chop is when the batter drives the ball into the ground in front of home plate and gets a large bounce over the infielders' heads for a single. This was named for the 19th century Baltimore Orioles (one of several teams by this name). The Baltimore Orioles played in the National League from 1892 to 1899, and in that time won the National League pennant three times and won the Temple Cup twice. Several hall-of-famers came from this team. The team was famous for tricky plays and dirty behavior. They were also experts in so-called inside baseball or small ball strategy, featuring base hits, stolen bases, and precision bunting, and the Baltimore Chop was a part of that strategy that they perfected. To help them get the bounce that they needed, the groundskeeper mixed the dirt in front of home plate with clay and kept it unwatered. 

A lot of what you're seeing in the news these days is driven by two problems which aren't solved by comprehensive in-competition testing. One is accessibility of athletes for out-of-competition testing, which is an issue in e.g. East Africa, where many elite distance runners train. Maintaining the infrastructure needed to get samples and test them in an unpredictable way is expensive, and despite some significant investment (e.g. by the World Marathon Majors) there still needs to be more funding to do this properly. Much of the negative news about Kenya from WADA has to do with the lack of testing infrastructure. The other problem - and this is what we're seeing from Russia - is the presence (or rumored presence) of state-sponsored structures which facilitate doping on a national level. If anti-doping "agents" (for lack of a better word) are simply testing individual athletes, that's one thing; if they're contending with an entire system which is coordinating evasion of out-of-competition testing, that's entirely another. And the stories coming out of Russia about evasion of testing are real James Bond stuff: local police detaining testers in order to give athletes time to get away, or to invalidate the samples either environmentally (keeping them from being refrigerated) or by breaking the chain of custody, athletes giving their whereabouts as in closed "military cities" to prevent surprise visits from testers, etc. When the full apparatus of the state is employed in protecting dopers, the "arms race" between cheaters and anti-doping officials becomes very expensive, underlining Canadian Coders' point about finances. So, the short answer to your question: in-competition testing happens and is pretty comprehensive, but it's not enough and the implications of closing the gaps are all expensive. 

Since 1995, the Stanley Cup Finals have had two or three games broadcast on a cable channel, and the rest of the games shown on a broadcast network. Before 1995, going back to 1981, almost all finals games were on cable channels. (1981 is around the time that national cable channels were just starting to take off.) From 1976-1979, the finals were syndicated on broadcast channels, and before that, only a few games were televised. Unfortunately for those of us that watch free TV, there is a recent trend toward putting more sports events on pay TV, despite the lower ratings. The majority of this years NCAA basketball tournament, including all the games of the Final Four, were on cable TV only. In the case of the Stanley Cup Finals, the fact that not all the games are shown on broadcast TV might be due to the fact that hockey is not as popular in the U.S. as baseball, football, or basketball. However, it could also be that, just like the NCAA tournament, the networks are trying to encourage cable TV subscriptions by hosting more big sports events on pay TV-only outlets. 

I'm thinking specifically of two classic races, San Silvestre de Vallecana and the Corrida Internacional de SÃ£o Silvestre, but those are far from the only such races. What is it about this saint that gets road races where others don't? Is it as as simple as New Year's Eve being the saint's feast day and also a convenient day for road racing (in the same way that Thanksgiving is a big day for road racing in the USA)? Or is there something particular to associate the saint with running? 

The first difference is generally considered to be an advantage to the runner on the inside, i.e. lane 1 has the most advantage and lane 8 the least. This is generally why people consider Van Niekerk's lane draw remarkable. The second difference, on the other hand, is mixed. The inner-most lanes (1, 2, and sometimes 3) are considered technically more difficult than the outer lanes, which have gentler turns; the wider sweep of the outer lanes means an athlete can put more energy into moving forward instead of turning their momentum. Individual runners' physiology and form can mitigate this problem; for example, Usain Bolt's long stride would theoretically be hampered by the inside lanes, but Bolt has also compensated for this by apparently developing very good form for the curve. So in theory the inside lane is disadvantaged and the outside advantaged by this, but in practice it varies. (This is why tracks with a full 9 lanes will run sprint races in 2-9 rather than 1-8.) (This, incidentally, is also why 4x100m relay teams sometimes put their fastest runners on the 1st or 3rd legs rather than the last, "anchor" leg - because starting from the blocks and running the bends are very specialized skills, and teams can pick up some advantage by putting runners who excel at those skills on those legs rather than on the anchor.) So with Van Niekerk as one "exceptional" lane 8 runner, it's worth also remembering two similarly exceptional lane 1 runners: both Angelo Taylor and John Akii-Bua won gold medals in the 400m hurdles from lane 1, with Akii-Bua, like Van Niekerk, setting a world record. Regardless of lane, however, it's clear that Van Niekerk is an extraordinary talent with excellent coaching and support to enable such a run. If the 2016 gold-medal run is not the peak of his career, I can't imagine what he will do to top it. 

These codes refer to the draw size of various aspects of the tournaments. For each category of the tournament, the number of participants in the main draw (the main tournament) is listed. 

I'm going to say that this scenario isn't possible. Let's consider a team that is trying to make the playoffs. They have two shots: the division title, and the wildcard spots. Both of these are based on the team's total record for all 16 games in the season. It is only when these 16-game records are tied that the tie breakers are considered. It is certainly possible that a team can be in a scenario where they know that a win in the last game does not help them, because they know that they will lose a tie breaker. However, losing the game cannot help them. Why? Because if they lose, they have a worse record than if they won. If they are in a three-way tie with a loss, then with a win they would have beaten both of those teams without the tie breaker. You might think that there could be a scenario where you need a certain team to win, and the team that they are playing happens to be you. I don't think this type of scenario is possible: whenever you need to hope that a certain team wins for your playoff hopes to stay alive, it is really because you need that team's opponent to lose. 

Your question, I think, proposes changing this rule, and you're looking for arguments against. The IAAF rules don't offer justifications, so it's difficult to argue from grounds more specific than "but that's the rules", but here are two reasons a mechanical system would not work: 

Generally the drop of trail running shoes will vary by model in much the same way it varies in regular running shoes. The principal differences that make a running shoe a trail running shoe are traction and durability; both of these will have an impact on the cushioning. Trail running shoes generally: 

For the track events, you've nailed it: the 200m standard indoor track means races of the same distance (e.g. 800m) can be notably different from races on a standard 400m outdoor track. In the sprints, the tight banked turns can significantly change the athlete's approach to the race, and some events (e.g. 60m) are only held indoors. For the field events, the reasoning for different records is more tricky. In the throws, e.g. shot put, the implements are different (size and weight). For the jumps, though, the differences are entirely environmental: lack of wind (either supporting or impeding) and different runway surfaces, mostly. In these events, competing indoors can actually be easier (although long jump and triple jump may be limited in the length of their run-up - I'm not sure if that would help or hurt an athlete). 

Yes, participants in wheelchair fencing in the Paralympic Games need to be disabled. The Paralympic Movement provides sport for people with disabilities. They list ten eligible impairment types, and in order for an athlete to compete, he or she must have a primary impairment that belongs to one of these impairment types. Each sport in the Paralympics has specific classifications with medical eligibility rules. For wheelchair fencing, which is administered by the International Wheelchair and Amputee Sports Federation(IWAS), these rules are found in the IWF Rules for Competition: Book 4: Classification Rules. The book spells out tests that certified Classifiers use to determine whether or not an athlete is eligible. Classifiers administer functional and bench tests to place athletes in one of five sport classes: 1A, 1B, 2, 3, and 4. On one end of the spectrum, class 1A participants are "athletes with no sitting balance who have a handicapped playing arm. No efficient elbow extension against gravity and no residual function of the hand which makes it necessary to fix the weapon with a bandage." At the other end, class 4 participants are "athletes with good sitting balance with the support of lower limbs and normal fencing arm." At the Paralympics, fencers compete in two categories: Category A is for fencers in class 3 or 4, and Category B is for fencers in class 2. There is a Category C for fencers in classes 1A and 1B; this category does compete in some international competitions, but is not normally in the Paralympic Games. (Source) The IWAS has a formal protest process. If someone feels that another athlete has not been classified correctly, they can issue a protest, and a jury of Classifiers will investigate and rule. The video that you referenced is of the gold medal bout at the London 2012 Paralympic Games in the Men's Individual Sabre Category A, the category for athletes with the least impairment. 

To add to Ale's thorough answer: in the case of any disqualification in a major athletics event, the official results will usually cite a specific rule in the IAAF competition rules (which Ale linked). If you look up that rule you see what violation they're being disqualified for. In this case it wasn't immediately obvious which exchange was the problem from the results, but often the rule cited in the results gives you the clue you need to explain the disqualification. 

Other factors are not specifically against record certification standards but were different in the Breaking2 effort. These changes get at the very definition of what counts as a "marathon": 

At the recent IAAF World Championships in Athletics, Hong Kong and the P.R. of China had separate teams in the 4x100m relay. I understand why the PRC and Chinese Taipei compete separately, as they are de facto separate countries, but why does Hong Kong have its own team? 

In most age-group competitions (e.g. masters, high school, etc) any short-course race longer than about 400m will have lap counters for each lane. (I say "short course" because of the number of lengths involved - for short course meters, SCM, the 400m is 16 lengths of a 25m pool, and for short course yards or SCY, which is widely contested in the USA, the 500y will be 20 lengths of a 25y pool. A big masters SCY meet will have the 500y, 1000y and 1650y events contested. Olympic events are LCM or Long Course Meters, so I'm not sure which events would get counted there; the 400m is only eight lengths or four laps.) The lap counters (N.B. this links to a sporting-goods site selling them) are pretty low-tech: they're waterproof boards with a handle at the top and numbers that can be flipped to indicate the number of lengths completed. A counter is positioned at the opposite end of the swimmer's lane from the starting blocks and will dip the board in at the wall as the swimmer approaches to show them their progress. Then they yank the board out before the swimmer turns so the board isn't kicked during the turn. Here's a short video showing lap counters at an age group meet, probably counting a 1650y race. In my experience this means the board (a) always shows an odd number, counting 1, 3, 5, etc., (b) usually is turned from one number to the next when the swimmer turns at the block end of the pool, so when two laps are completed the counter is turned to 3, etc., and (c) for the last length the counter will show two orange squares indicating the swimmer should finish after the next length. The counters handling the boards are usually volunteers, often teammates of the swimmers. I've counted for my brother dozens of times. When the counter is known to the swimmer there's a chance of communicating additional data, e.g. if the swimmer is ahead or behind their goal pace, by swinging the board from side to side or pumping it up and down. Sometimes the swimmer will ask not to be shown a count for every lap in order to keep their head clearer. Ideally the officials at the block end of the pool will be monitoring the counters to ensure they're not asleep on the job, but miscounts sometimes happen as they do in track races. Pro/international level races might have a more sophisticated system (and in LCM probably fewer races will have enough lengths to merit counters), but this is what I've seen in place for the majority of meets I've watched or competed in.
