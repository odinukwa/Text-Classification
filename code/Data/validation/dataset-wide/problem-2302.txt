Luggage is usually chosen on its size, not on the weight it can transport. Liters are a measure of size, kilos are a measure of weight. To me it is harder to convert a given weight in a certain substance into a real size than it is to convert a given number in liters to a real size. If you want to know how many kilos of water a given pack can move, you can just replace liters with kilos. Good pack makers will also tell you the weight limits of your pack if you are likely to reach them in normal use, but as very few people will be able to lift and carry backpacks filled to the limits with heavy items, a well made pack should be able to withstand more kilos than the average human can carry. The point where packs fail is mostly after use, so a weight limit or indication will not be very helpful. 

Finally, wrap a second sling around the person's torso (under the working armpit and around the disabled arm) to prevent the arm from swinging forward. Your patient should be able to stand up, lean forward, and rotate their torso without any movement of the disabled arm. Check again to ensure good circulation at the finger tips. Here's an example of a well-built full splint: 

Those types of glasses do not provide adequate protection from sunlight, especially in areas with lots of reflective surfaces (desert, snow) and at high elevations where there's more UV radiation due to the thinner atmosphere above you. What you want are either wrap-around glasses which don't let light in the sides, or particular glasses called "glacier glasses". Glacier glasses have a fabric/leather/plastic shield on the side which prevents light from coming in. 

Self-assessment is difficult because your level of consciousness (LOC) may be impaired. Unfortunately, one's own state of mind is also very difficult to self-assess. I'll list here a brief overview of some of the "self-checks" you can do, but (as I'm sure you're already aware), getting a second person to check you out as soon as possible will help ensure you haven't missed anything. In situations where there may be nobody else nearby at all, it might not be a bad idea to carry a small checklist card with you, which you could refer back to and check things off as you assess yourself to make sure you don't forget anything if your LOC is reduced. In wilderness medicine we use the concept of the Patient Assessment System (PAS) as a standard way to check a patient and systematically identify possible problems. The full PAS could take a whole post of its own, or indeed most of an entire course. If this stuff is interesting to you, consider taking a wilderness first air or wilderness first responder course to really learn it in detail. The first step is to assess your immediate physical safety, i.e. a scene survey. In a self-assessment situation, the main thing you need to get out of a scene survey is whether or not it's safe to stay where you are. Just fell off some rocks? Are you at risk for further rockfall coming down on top of you, or is your current position at risk for falling further down the slope? If you need to move to eliminate possible life-threatening hazards (and you are physically capable of doing so), you should try to do so as soon as possible. After doing what you can to prevent any further injury, you go into a primary assessment, which can be remembered by the acronym ABCDE. The first two are less relevant in a self-assessment, but I'm including them because these go in order of priority, and it's good to know. If any issue is identified during the primary assessment, that's a "stop-and-fix" problem – you deal with that before moving on to the next step. Is anything blocking your airway? In a self-assessment, this should be very obvious. Breathing: Again, obvious. If you aren't breathing, you probably aren't going to be assessing yourself in the first place. Circulation: Is your heart working? If you're checking yourself, probably. This is also the time to check for any major bleeding. Do a quick blood sweep – run your hands over your body, checking to see if any blood appears. Sometimes serious wounds may not even hurt at first when you have adrenaline pumping and other injuries may be distracting you from the pain. Physically running your hands over your head, neck, arms, back, chest, legs, etc. and checking to see if any blood shows up is a good way to make sure you aren't missing something major. This step is very important in a self-assessment, because you can't see every inch of your body yourself. Deformity/disability: Is anything deformed or out of place? Are you at risk for permanent disability from a spinal injury? In considering whether a spinal injury may be a problem, there are various possible mechanisms of injury (MOI) which would lead one to suspect a possible spinal injury until proven otherwise. This includes a fall from >3x your body height (which occurred in your example), tumbling falls, sudden changes in movement (e.g. falling off a bike, crashing while skiing), falls directly onto the head or neck, and a variety of other causes. Standard procedure is to immobilize the spinal column when there's an MOI for a spinal injury, but it's near-impossible to keep your own neck still while inspecting yourself. If you do have to move your neck, make sure to do so very slowly, and if you meet any kind of resistance or pain when turning your head/neck, stop that motion. Regarding "deformity", this is where you do a "chunk-check" to see if anything else is out of place on your body. This part is a bit more difficult to do on yourself than to do on somebody else, but you can do it. The basic idea is to use your hands to quickly feel your body from head to toe (and finger), feeling for anything which is sticking out where it shouldn't be, or not sticking out where it should be. If something feels kinda weird, you can compare to the other side of your body to see if it's generally symmetrical or not. If you find any pain anywhere, try to take a closer look – that's a spot where you may need to deal with something. Note that minor injuries found during the chunk-check don't need to be dealt with immediately. If you can, write them down so you don't forget. If it's an immediate threat to life, then you should stop-and-fix. Environment: The last part of the primary survey is to take note of your environment and protect yourself from the elements. Once you get too cold, it's very difficult – especially when injured – to warm back up. It's always a good idea to sit on a pad if you have one handy, put on some jackets and a hat, or if it's hot go sit in the shade. You need to take care of any environmental risks before proceeding to treat non-life-threatening problems such as sprains or small fractures. If you have some kind of portable shelter like a tarp or bivvy sack, now is a good time to get that out. If you fell into water, get dry before you develop hypothermia. Environmental emergencies like hypothermia and heat stroke are very preventable yet frequently complicate wilderness emergencies because it's easy to neglect. You should also take a moment to take care of your other bodily needs – drink some water, eat a snack, and make sure all your bodily systems can run as well as possible, so you can focus on fixing any injuries. 

Chest guards works as the same of arm guards. It protects the archer from get the sting from the string. Although, when an archer shoots his/her arm, it's more likely it's related to his/her form while shooting his/her chest is a natural body shape fact. (not an actual problem, just as it is.) It's also very commonly used by girls for obvious reason but some guys with a slightly longer draw length might use it as well. 

The male spends the dark winter incubating the egg in his brood pouch, balancing it on the tops of his feet, for 64 consecutive days until hatching. According to Wikipedia. 

I've tanned some hides before. I believe you want to do only half the process otherwise you lose the fur. Basically, you flay the animal (remove the skin). Then wash all the blood and stuff. Get it nice and clean and let it dry. I found direct sun dried is better. Also, if you can tie it up really stretched it will be better. It's not a very complex process but you need to keep an eye to see how it goes. It's kind of like cooking, after you get the idea you know when it's good. Practice takes you to perfection. :) 

Of course. You can (almost) always cool down a 4-season tent, but you can't very well protect a 2-season tent from a blizzard. The primary concern is weight, but if you're going to be camping near a glacier with -5°C winds, you'll want a sturdy tent, so that's going to come at a certain cost of weight. To keep a tent cooler, you can pitch it in the shade, you can open the vents and windows, etc. There's nothing wrong with using a 4 season tent in the summer; I've done this on many a trip. The point of the quote you referenced is that a 4 season tent may not be ideal in non-winter conditions, as there may be a more convenient tent, but the a 4 season tent is certainly more than adequate for camping in summer conditions. 

Of course, dinosaurs are but one of many fossils out there, and this map only shows North America. The best way to find fossils near you is to search the internet for "fossils" and "your region", e.g. "fossils in Oregon" or "fossils in Ireland" or wherever you are. Many known fossil deposits are protected areas for conservation, but there are plenty of places where you can see them yourself. Many people think of giant dinosaur bones when they think of fossils, but there are millions (if not billions) of fossils of much smaller organisms out there – fossils tiny sea creatures abound embedded in rocks along coastlines, like these:

Aglets, shoelaces being easy to find and in the right lengths, the smooth exterior and if you have the right kind, the ease of tying and staying in their knots. As a hobby knot tyer, (and member of the International Guild of Knot Tyers) I use mountain boot laces to try out the knots I am working with, rather than paracord. On the other hand, I know enough people who make their own laces out of cord of the right size and with a smooth enough surface for the shoes they are used in. Reasons to make their own: Longer lasting laces. Needing non standard lengths. Needing non standard diameter laces. Needing two different lengths due to having an insole or two very different feet. Wanting a colour or design which is not available in their (local) shops. As long as the ends are finished in a way that works, they are happy with their laces, often so happy that they never go back to shop bought ones. While I do agree with using other readily available string and might do it one time, I do not think braiding your own is useful. See my answer here on Arts and Crafts Stack Exchange. One 'knot' that is very useful for making (temporary) shoe laces out of other string is the whipping to finish the ends. Here the Common Whipping on the animated knots site (others are available.) (The site I linked to in the first word of this answer is that of Ian Fieggen, who has a great site about shoe laces, their knots and whatever else you may need to know about them.) 

Print your faces and stick on cardboard. They last a lot longer. Waterproof paper might help if you're planning to shoot in not so fair weather. 

There it is. You get one of those and you can bake anything you want. I've used before and it's awesome. Edit --- Just updated with a link to MEC website. They seem to have it in stock Outback oven Below is how it works. 

There are table widely available to figure out the ideal spine for the archer/bow. I don't quite believe in the "bare shaft shooting" because as M'vy said, there are defects in shafts, vanes, nocks, points and even weight difference would affect the grouping. The best thing I find is to fetch them and shoot. Number your arrows and check which ones are off the group. I believe spines above or below the ideal wouldn't make much difference, at least for barebows or olympic recurves unless you're shooting in the olympics. I shoot barebow for Field and compound for target and, as a comparison, I don't spend nearly as much time working on my field arrows then I do for my target arrows (specially the indoors). There are also little tricks you can apply to your arrow tuning like heavier points with smaller vanes, shorter or longer arrows (always leaving some safety clearance) and so on. 

From a male friend I heard that a wrongly designed or wrongly adjusted harness did hurt his private parts when it came under stress the first time. In this case not permanent because he was wise enough to test the harness while still on the ground, but as he is likely to abseil it could have happened when he was committed on the way down. He also told us about working in a harness for a whole shift, somewhere in the middle of an abseil inside a narrow part of a building, no way to get out for the breaks. In that case you will want the best fit and extra attention on comfort. So not all males can use all harnesses, they have to be adjusted right for the person and the job the harness has to do. 

If you have string or rope around which is handy, start with that. You can go out to buy lines when you are a bit more experienced and know what you want and need in them. The best string or rope I have ever found to try out knots is shoe and boot laces. They are easy to tie, relatively easy to untie from almost every knot, hard wearing and nice to handle. And they come with aglets, helping in feeding through the ends. For practical knots I usually go for the thickest size mountain boot lace. They are the size that fits my hands, they might be a bit thin for some people. If you make your own training piece of string, remember to finish off the ends well. Taking a page of the shoe lace book might help, by putting a narrower stiff end on. (Imitating aglets.) When you know the basic shape of the knots you will need to use in serious situations, like in climbing where your life is going to depend on it, you have to have trained in the rope you are going to use for the purpose. The actual rope is best in that case but shorter ends for just learning have their uses as well. And when you are going to use laid rope, you should be familiar with how that rope handles. Which is rather different from the way braided rope and string handles. Each knottyer I know has his/her own 'trained' piece(s) of string with which he/she is trying out new knots, teaching others and doing bits of showy knot work when people are watching. Each person will tell you why this is the best string. The only thing they have in common is that the user has used it many times, is very familiar with how it behaves and is happy to use it. 

I'm about to purchase my first belay device, and am wondering how long I might expect it to last. What signs should I be looking at to determine when a belay device eventually needs to be replaced? 

In English, that means if you have an ACE wrap (like this) you should wrap it around the bitten extremity, starting further away from the center of the body (distal) and moving towards the center of the body (proximal), then back. The purpose is to apply a small amount of pressure to slightly slow flow through the lymph nodes as this is one way the venom can move through the body. Checking CSMs means checking the circulation, sensation, and movement below the location of the bite. You want to ensure that the wrap doesn't cut off circulation, and should monitor whether the patient's ability to feel and move their fingers/toes is decreasing over time. You may need to remove and adjust the wrap if swelling occurs, this is why it's important to check CSMs every 10-15 minutes. You can also optionally take antihistamines (like benadryl) to slow the body's reaction to the venom. This will not prevent tissue damage, but can prevent an anaphylaxic reaction. Once the wound is cleaned and optionally wrapped, you can walk out, but walk slowly to avoid further injuries. Make sure to take frequent breaks to check if swelling has progressed and to monitor CSMs. 

My brother used to work as decorator, (which included placing new glass in windows) and his Swiss knife saw blade has helped him several times while working on scaffolding. No need to go down and get a proper saw to cut the wood to hold the new glass. And he has used it for many small jobs, just because it was the tool at hand and he remembered that it was there. Most people seem to forget that they have the saw as part of their knife and go to get a saw. 

While bunching up (see the answer by @Charlie Brumbaugh) works most times, it might be useful to have a method at hand that is less bulky for storing purposes. You can make a Chain Sinnet, which is a slip knot into which you pull a loop and repeat. When you fold your tarp or tent and find several lines together (making the bunches inconvenient as it makes too much of a bump) you can chain them together, by pulling all lines together into the loops and going on till the complete lengths are used. The final move of a chain that is in danger of getting undone is to pull the last end through the loop. But when putting the tarp in storage I would leave it without that last move to help in undoing when you use the tarp again. For shortening while using the tarp, the Chain Shortening will work, but best when the line is used. In that case you will need to fix the end of the chain, by pulling the end through or by tying an extra bit of string around the loop and the rest of the line. 

A forecast should be posted daily at all ranger stations and visitor centers in the park. This will be the most reliable (i.e. not dependent on technology) way to get an up-to-date forecast. On the National Weather Service website, it says the following: 

I don't know of a source for Europe, but The American Alpine Club published "Accidents in North American Mountaineering" annually. 

A word on equipment Wilderness medicine is all about being creative, and being selective in the tools you bring with you. It's possible to build a splint using bark from a tree, or your hiking poles, or any other of a number of objects. It's possible to make a wrap by cutting up a shirt. However, every minute you spend hunting around the forest for the right stick to make a crappy splint out of is another minute of daylight lost in what just became a much longer day for you. In more austere environments there may be no natural materials to use at all, and you may need every piece of gear you have. You asked for natural materials or common equipment, but I would implore you to make a few simple pieces of first aid equipment part of your common equipment. Especially when car camping, there is no excuse not to carry them. There are a number of relatively light-weight pieces of first aid equipment you can carry which can be used for many applications and will save you a lot of trouble if you need them. A sleeping pad, a SAM splint, a couple ACE wraps, a couple cravats, some coflex tape, and some gauze rolls are easy to carry and can be used to address almost any injury that you have a hope of addressing in the field. The further you are from definitive care and the less you can afford to tie up critical equipment in treating injuries, the more sense it makes to carry these simple pieces of equipment. All of these supplies can be purchased by anybody for very little cost. 

Backpacks are primarily designed to be carried out therefore they need to be light. They also need to be tough so they can endure the trips the specified weights for a long time. Although we do get rained out every now and again no one plans a trip around raining days (Oh look, it's raining let's go hiking). So it's more "efficient" to keep the packs light using a lighter material and just put a simple rain cover in case of rain than make the packs heavier with waterproof material. There are waterproof packs in the market. I own a couple myself. My petzl portage 30 looks more like a drybag with shoulder straps but I use that one specific for canyoning. I also have a my hiking/trekking pack that uses c-canvas that is waterproof but then my pack weights 3kgs alone. Cactus Foray My wife has an Osprey Ariel 50 and it's a whole kg lighter than mine. Even if we compare a pack the same size as mine (70L), the Osprey one still a good 800gr lighter and that includes the cover that comes with the pack. So, in summary...
