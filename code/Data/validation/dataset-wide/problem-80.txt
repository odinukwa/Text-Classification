Don't supply gold, supply troops. One option, apart from AlexP's excellent answer, is to avoid supplying any gold directly to the autocrat. In your case, the autocrat wants to spend the gold, borrowed from you, convincing a number of lords to join his quest. So perhaps you could buy those lords directly instead? "My Lord, it would be highly lucrative for you to supply troops to the King in the coming war. If you so wish, I can lend you the gold to set up an army." (Or hire mercenaries) If all goes well, the King won't be in debt to you directly, but to several lords/vassals. Ignoring them might be more dangerous than going after you. And if one of those lords refuse to pay... well hopefully you have the autocrat on your side there. In short, spread your risk by supplying troops through intermediarys instead of lending directly to the autocrat. 

Ok, I'll have a go. The world has about a dozen separate major armies, all listed as in sports league. One army is the reigning champion. Being a member of any of those armies is a relatively priviledged life. Enlisting as a common soldier means a substatially better life than that of a civilian blue collar job, while high ranking officers are on par with professional athletes in major sports today. Being a member of the champion team is even better. That is a life people would (literally!) kill for. Now, every once in a while, the armies compete in mock battles, fighting for practice, aquiring sponsors etc. But the position as champion can only be attained by actual mortal combat. Any team may challenge the reigning champions. The objective of the war is not known beforehand, it is revealed a time before the battle begins. Acts of heroism are awarded, acts of cowardice punished. Families of killed soldiers (esp "heroic death") are richly compensated. Survivors from the losing side might try to reassemble their army, survivors from the winning side have it made. 

It is feasible, though probably not with a standing jump. You ask for 30' ie roughly 9m. Let's compare that to what a human can do as a base for what a humanoid engineered specifically for high jumps might achieve. The highest recorded standing jump is 1.6m (5.3ft) ~18% of your goal. The world record high jump is 2.45m (8ft) ~27% of your goal. Still quite far off. The world record for pole vault, however, is 6.16m (20ft). Now we're getting close! You might consider pole vaulting to be cheating, but the pole itself does not add any energy to the athlete, it is merely an aid to convert horizontal running speed to vertical launch speed. Your engineered humanoid might use a specialized leg in the same manner. From Vashus answer we have that a 30' jump requires a vertical launch speed of 13.5 m/s. Usain Bolt tops out at about 12.4 m/s. So a top human sprinter with perfect technique might jump 7,8m (25.7ft) ie the physical limits of real humans is somewhere around 85% of your goal for a fantasy humanoid engineered specifically for high jumps. The jury is in, 30' high jumps are not unrealistic, if you allow for a more elaborate technique than a standing jump. 

I'd suggest that there are three factors limiting your characters abilities, all of them can be measured with SI units if you want a scientific touch. Energy (J) The first and most obvious one is the amout of pure energy he can deliver by magical means. Can he levitate a truck on top a mountain (or an X-wing from a swamp), or just lift a scroll from someones pocket (or a lightsaber to his hand)? This is important, if you want to keep the basic laws of physics. The "magical" energy must be drained from some source, either the mages own metabolism or channeled from an external source. As your character exersices, he can direct more energy by magical means. Effect (W) Energy is one thing. How quickly you can apply it is another. A Watt is one Joule per second. Your character has always been able to warm an item, but while in his youth it took him forever to make a cup of water lukewarm, he can now make the dagger in your hand burning hot in an instant. Focus (sr or m) So you have magical powers. You have the force and the stamina. But can you control it? If you want to hurt (or kill) someone, must you resort to throwing his entire body against the wall with your magic, or are your powers focused enough so you just need to manipulate his nerve cells? Flashlight or laser? Shotgun or sniper rifle? 

It would probably be possible(ish) but I'd pick something else than a ballista for stage one. Use some siege weapon more adapted to hurling heavy payloads, like a trebuchet, for the first stage. Then make a projectile for the trebuchet of a fin-stabilized ballista with some sort of delay mechanism that triggers stage two... Ok, it's not really practical, but not impossible and follows the rule of cool. On second thought, you can use the trailed rope to stabilize the ballista and skip the fins. 

Now, having such ground material there is a stroke of dumb luck, but not impossible. Wedging the sword in a rock crack is way more plausible though. But here comes the main problem: How to you transfer the weight from yourself onto the sword? I have practiced this in alpine crevasse rescue situations and let me tell you: It is difficult and takes time and preparations. It will be quicker to just wait until your friend climbs up than to attempt this. 

A common trope in cyber punkish sci-fi is the ability to upload a human mind to some storage device or AI. This of course grants practical immortality but it is also the main hurdle for tropes like teleportation, cloning etc. So my question is: how close are we to being able to make restorable backups of a human brain? What scientific or engineering break throughs are required? For the sake of this question, the goal is: 

The mount IS the weapon I know you want answers focusing on the knights weapons, not the capabilities of the creatures themselves, but still any reasonable answer must start with an analysis of an unarmed rider. What can we give him that will make the rider/mount combination even more effective? Oversized fantacy eagles and pterodactyles are formidable weapons in their own right. Especially if breeded for the purpose. If I was in a aerial battle such as you envision, the beak, talons and sheer momentum of my opponents mount would be my main worry. Anything fired, thrown or wielded by a human rider a very distant second. To engage the eneny, I would manouver into a advantageous position (higher altitude and if possible between the enemy and the sun), pick a target and order my creature to attack using its strength, not get in a relatively weaker position and try to compensate with weaponry. Think about how a rider could use a sword or spear for example. The best angle of attack (if the rider wants to stab or slash his opponent) is from below, where the wings and head of his own mount is not in the way. Now this is exactly the position you don't want to be in while fighting a giant eagle. Human muscle plus spear vs fantacy beast muscle plus multiple talons? Wanna bet on the outcome? Any "weapon" for the pilot would merely compensate for the mounts weak spots. They would be aimed at an enemy that is attacking you from behind/above. A crossbow might not be the best way to bring down an enemy, but it might at least force an attacker diving towards you to make some evasive manouvers. Nets thrown (or rather just released) in your wake will cause trouble for an enemy chasing you. So my answer is: short bows or crossbows. Not for attacking the enemy, but to deny him easy access to your own weak spots. Defences So what do the cities deploy as defence against airborne attacks? I'd say that catapults and bows/crossbows will be the last resort, due to their limited range (and the sad fact that anything fired straight up will come back down at you). This, after all, is a world where fying creatures are bred and trained for combat. So what better way to defend your city agains flying invaders than another breed of flying creatures. But we want a purely defensive role. I'd go with a massive number of smaller birds, like starlings. Train them to swarm between your city and the approacing enemy. Train them to actually attack the war-eagles, relying on numbers to overwhelm them. Hundreds of small birds picking and clawing at each attacker will break up the assault and possibly force the enemy down. Or take it one step further and release swarms of wasps.
