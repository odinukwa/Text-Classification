This is valid. But one of the premises (i.e. (1)) and the conclusion are false. Arguments by analogy cannot be valid. Instead, they can be strong or weak depending on how convincing they are. The same is true of inductive arguments. The distinction has to do with what an argument can accomplish. A valid deductive argument is "truth-preserving" meaning that if its premises are true, its conclusion is necessarily true. A strong inductive argument is not truth-preserving, it just more or less probably true. Thus, the belief (seen here as a conclusion reached on looking at a large amount of evidence) that there are only white swans had a good degree of support but its conclusion turned out to be false. It didn't mean the argument for the claim was weak -- just that it was a type of argument that is always defeasible. Invalid is not a bad thing for inductive and analogy arguments. It's just part of the nature of the beast. 

For (b), we are trying to prove (A &B) v (~A & ~B). This one is a little tougher to crack, because we want a disjunction as a conclusion. We can get this if we can prove either half or if we can prove something else that is incoherent and turn into the two halves. Here it is quite helpful to know that Carla is a knave, because that means we can use that in conjunction with 2. 

Namely, there seems to be something jumbled about what happens in 3. I would probably formulate this type of argument as follows: 

I believe the quote is apocryphal. Some of the sentiment might be compatible with Confucianism but there are several problems for supposing Kongzi would have said this or that this would be found in a work people classically attributed to Confucius. (It is well known that the texts attributed to Confucius were not written by Confucius) 

"Utilitarians" are all about pleasure. Therefore, it's weird for them to then be obsessed with pain, which is generally taken to be the opposite of pleasure. 

For what it's worth - you could probably quite easily store the schematics for the 100 most powerful super computers on one USB stick. Furthermore, its not the complexity of a thing that makes it powerful, its the sophistication of its design (if you will). An example to support the point: The schematics for a medieval repeating-crossbow (yes they existed) were probably as complicated as the schematics for a modern revolver, yet the revolver is more powerful. 

I have a small-claims matter pending with the courts in my state. Here, self-represented parties are required to attend an information session, which I attended today. During this session the presenter talked about mandatory settlement conferences, in which the parties both present summaries of their cases to the deputy-judge, who then tells the parties how he would rule if he were the trial judge for the matter. The courts operate these conferences to encourage settlement and reduce the number of cases that proceed to trial. I asked one of the two presenters, "I heard that the settlement-conference deputy-judges usually press the guy with the most money to make the larger concession; is that true?" She replied, "Well. Hm. Maybe my colleague should answer that." Her colleague answered, "Let's take that to an extreme. If that were the case, then the settlement conference deputy-judges would just look at each person's net-worth and tell the richer person that he expects him to prevail if the matter proceeds to trial." (I accepted his answer, but ultimately, the first speaker conceded that what I heard wasn't entirely inaccurate.) I thought the second speaker misused reduction to the extreme in a manner analogous to countering the claim that there are aliens living on earth by arguing that if that were true, then there would be so many of them that we would have to stack them face-to-face toward the sky in order to fit them all on our planet. But if I claimed that relish is a vegetable, one might argue that if that were the case then one could get half a day's worth of vegetables from several packets of relish and ketchup. That example seems to succeed, but the prior example seems to fail. Why? 

There's several ambiguities in your question that an answer needs to address. First, I am going to assume that your uses of "should" refer to moral rather than legal determinations. Otherwise, this isn't going to fit under philosophy. Second, I'm going to answer in terms of applied ethics rather than formal ethical theories. Third, I will following your question, use rights language. Assuming citizens have rights, there are several different ways to conceive of rights. There's Isaiah Berlin's positive and negative rights distinction. On this account, negative rights where the government should not interfere with a course of action. Positive rights reflect those cases where the government or some other party is compelled to act for you. "Keep the government out of the bedroom" articulates a negative right --> to be able to sleep with whom you choose when you choose. "The government should make sure no one goes hungry" is a positive rights claim that the government has a duty to supply everyone with food. A second distinction some draw is between first-order and second-order rights. A first-order right is something you have a direct right to. A second-order right is something that you have in light of your first order rights. So if you have a first order right to live, then you may claim a second order right that the government give you food. If you have a first order right to speech, then you have a second order right to the means of speaking. (i.e., the government cannot prohibit you from making speeches in public areas if you have a right of free speech). Actually, some take this further and speak of 3rd order rights -- but that's irrelevant for our purposes. We need one further distinction to complete the philosophical picture. There are absolute and mitigable rights. Absolute rights are those which are of "incomparable worth" (to use a construction from Kant) whereas mitigable rights are those of "price" -- meaning they are tradeable for other things of moral value. Given these three axes, we can give some answers. 

I'm going to abstract this and call the brain a box. To get a minimum amount of energy you would need to define the properties of the box and its starting state. More specifically, 

The third formulation:Â Act that your will can regard itself at the same time as making universal law through its maxim. 

Among humans? Or among mating organisms in general? Also, in what circumstances? Economically Suppose a couple who value what most people value, and who value those things about as much as most people value them. If they share fixed costs (shelter, utilities, and furnishings), then the arrangement will effect more value for each of them; presuming, living with another person doesn't offset the added value. Otherwise, parasitism better characterizes the arrangement than symbiosis does. Reproductively Whether we ought to regard cohabitating as symbiotic, or regard it as parasitic, depends on the circumstances: Can either party force the other to mate with it? How would doing so affect either party's absolute reproductive success (the number of organisms at an arbitrary future time that will have descended from the ancestor in question)? Game theory explicates this intertesselation well. The game proceeds as follows. First note the following game parameters. 

I've been studying philosophy as a hobby, for a few months now. I haven't found a helpful source of philosophical summaries. Some of the problems I've encountered: 

That said, it is also important to stipulate what information we have to answer the question? Do we have perfect knowledge? If so, then you know how much energy each person would use developing a given proof, control for the energy consumed at rest and thinking about the proof. The difference multiplied by the time spent thinking about the proof and only about the proof will be the energy used to create the proof. Consider the amount of energy each person consumed in formulating the proof, select the lowest value, and you have the minimum figure for all extant people. 

What is the difference between an 'idea' and a 'concept'? Has a distinction between the two terms been settled and accepted by most modern philosophers? 

We cannot infer the conclusion. For a graphical proof with venn diagrams, see AII - form two from this link. 

Background Before answering for your specific case, there's an important prior issue related to what "fallacy" means. This matters, because many people think fallacy is a magic word. And there is a context where a certain type of fallacy is a magic word, but in most contexts fallacies are fuzzy things and their presence/absence doesn't change much about an argument. The first distinction to be aware of is between formal and informal fallacies. A formal fallacy is a mistake in reasoning in a formal proof system. Committing such a fallacy when one is making a formal proof wholly invalidates the argument. (Examples include: affirming the consequence, denying the antecedent) This is usually what people seem to think all fallacies do. Most arguments, however, are not formal proofs. In such arguments, fallacies can also occur, but these are informal fallacies. An informal fallacy is an error or flaw in the reasoning that undermines the argument. The problem, however, is that a large portion of these informal fallacies are open to debate -- both as to whether they are occurring in a specific case and whether this breaks the argument where they occur. Answer As I read it, there's an equivocation happening in an implicit argument related to what you're quoting there. 

a thing that continues to exist (it is there at points in time A and B). an alteration such that something about this thing is different at points in time A and B. 

Consequently, D must also be false, since it's truth would require A, B, and C to all be true, but we already know A and B cannot both be true. Without rereading J.J. Thomson's article, I would say C is highly improbable. You can capture this from the internal logic of C -- namely, for C to be true, Thomson would have to somewhere declare that "torturing someone is not as bad as killing them." In the absence of that, she's not saying C. Consequently, the answer will be B -- as based on the passage you note above.
