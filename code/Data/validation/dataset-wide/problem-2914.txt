It's one of the more common ways of formulating of Utilitarianism. Jonathan Bentham and John Stuart Mill are two well-known Modern Utilitarianists. The only contemporary philosopher that comes to mind is Peter Singer. 

A bunch of the pre-Socratics can be thought of as materialist. Thales, for instance, thought that everything was ultimately water. There are a bunch of other philosophers that followed and argued that reality was fundamentally fire or air or whatever. Democritus thought the fundamental 'stuff' were small particles, which he called atoms. He is usually thought of as the father of materialism. In the Modern Era, Locke is usually associated more with Epistemology and Empiricism, but he believed that reality was ultimately made up of 'corpuscules', which are basically atoms. Contemporary philosophers generally don't refer to themselves as materialists, for a variety of reasons. The spirit of materialism has been preserved in Naturalism, the position that only the Natural exists, and is discoverable through scientific methods. The New York Times recently published a series of exchanges between Tim Williamson and Alex Rosenburg about Naturalism. In order: $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ 

Your question leads directly to 2 important considerations. First, whether the physical laws we discover through science are merely 'resemblances' - that they reflect but are not actual natural realities; and Second, that the laws of physics do reflect physical content or constituents themselves as it is like in nature. This in turn depends on your own metaphysical view of what is possible to be known by the human senses. The problem with the term 'Laws of Nature' that is often used in science today (or in textbooks) is that it is a misleading way of putting what in actuality are our best theories. These theories are what, after multiple tests and confirmations, verified as they are separately in experiments, are considered to be true because they give us the best results. They are not considered final. In this sense, 'Laws' as they are used, are actually tentative theories, they are not the final say in any descriptions of reality. This is because even the most well tested and described laws, such as Newton's Laws of Motion and gravitation, have limits. For instance, after Einstein, the laws do not give predictable results at high speeds or small quantities. Thus, Laws can never be Laws in our modern sense of certainty because they are incomplete. They raise further questions about physical phenomena that require further experimentation and testing. These questions are raised when we synthesize it with other laws that we know from other experiments, or from before. For example the recent discovery of the Hiigs Boson can be considered a result that has been built upon not just our knowledge of quantum mechanics, but also our understanding of electromagnetism and classical mechanics. The lack of a unifying theory does not mean that we do not understand nature. Often, we are dependent on these theories to built upon our understanding of reality and nature. It is fundamentally important then to distinguish between the metaphysical question of whether nature can really be discovered as it is by our senses, and whether there are laws of nature that are scientific theories to be discovered through experimentation, that are dependent on our senses. 

My answer is a bit long, so I'm going give you the short answer first. Virtue is a necessary condition of achieving eudaimonia. However, this is different than the answer to the question as it was formulated at the end of your post, "Is there an argument that a good life can be lived without being good?". One could easily argue that a person can live a good life, independently of virtue, simply by providing examples of individuals who have a "good life" but who are not virtuous. However, if you are using the phrase "living a good life" to explicitly mean "achieve eudaimonia", then an individual cannot achieve eudaimonia without virtue. As you seem to be aware, there are multiple conceptions of eudaimonia. The three best documented views are those of the Stoics, Artistole and Epicurus. I will quickly summarize their views as relevant to your question: 

Consider your first scenario. You question if an instantaneous state can lead to good outcomes. The answer a Consequentialist will tell you is no. There are no good outcomes where time for reasoning is not allowed. Consider your second and third scenario (which are inverse propositions). A consequentialist will tell you it depends. The length of time do not affect the amount of possible outcomes, because the possible inputs are infinite at any point of time. Thus, at any point of time, use the greatest possible information that are relevant to the consideration in mind. Keep in mind the difference between 2 things. There is the point of time in which you choose as your 'function'. And there is the amount of inputs, which ranges. However, at any one point of time, you are given only one set of inputs and a specific evaluative criteria, taken from the point of view of an actor. If in that shorter period of time leads to worser outcomes than the longer period of time, both using the same set of criteria to evaluate the value of outcomes, then a Consequentialst will not go ahead with that action. Again, it depends on what criteria you use to evaluate the outcomes. Some consequentialists will say it is greater happiness, some will say it is greater security. Your outcome will depend on this evaluative criteria. If the consequences in the longer period of time justifies and overrides the negative consequences in the shorter period of time, then the consequentialist will go ahead with it. Consider your fourth scenario. You consider groups. You cannot simply add the inputs together because the evaluative criteria (the equation) changes. How would a consequentialist deal with this? Ignore the individual actors totally and consider the group. Determine the evaluative criteria and inputs possible for this group that you choose, and draw the function. You will get the answer. The questions you raise are not new to Consequentialism as a moral theory. There are mainly two types: 'Act' and 'Rule'. Act consequentialism says that the rightness of the act depends on what the individual knows at that point of time, and choose optimally upon. Rule consequentialism says that it is the group's, or more complete information, that should determine the rightness of acts. This is the subjectivist vs. objectivist concern. 

I'll try to expand on Michael's terse answer. Basically, no. Objectivity is usually taken to mean something like "mind-independent". Exactly what this means is up for some wiggle-room (what is objective? or what kinds of things can be objective?), but in most cases it's fairly clear cut. Subjectivity, conversely, is "mind-depended". Again, it's pretty clear, but it's up for debate precisely what this means (is the existence of emotions subjective? Some would say trivially so, because there has to be a mind to have an emotion, but subjectivity is usually taken to be an epistemic notion, so it's not so clear if this is a good use of the term). Even if something is dependent on 6 billion minds, it's still mind-dependent. What are the intuitions behind your question? I can't say for sure, but I can speculate: (1) Objectivity/subjectivity has a functional flavor to them. It's almost like an objective truth is one that you can 'bump into', that resists you or imposes itself on you. Mass agreement might have this kind of cognitive 'substance'. (2) A subjective truth is one where there can be genuine disagreement, because the facts of the case depend on an individual's standpoint, and disputes can't be resolved with reference to external facts. If everyone agrees on something, then there can't be disagreement. (3) It might have the same impulse as "If everyone decided that cats were dogs, then they would be." If we take this to be a definition, then yeah, if everyone decided cat meant dog, then cat means dog. It doesn't mean that cats are the same as dogs, it's just that we've decided to use the words in that way. This question could have other possible motivations, but I think these cover the most likely ones. Feel free to explain more or ask questions. 

Update: Regarding the first scenario, there is a school of thought, 'Intuitionists', who will say that instantaneous states do not lead to worser outcomes because one can consider past experiences as helpful to making decisions. 

I would like to answer your question directly and succintly. First, you need to start reading a lot. Philosophy helps in that, it presents arguments that requires you to dissect those parts of the proposition, and reconsider it. Read introductory books on critical thinking, philosophy, but also expand your horizons and see what is going on in current affairs. This is because most of the fallacies are out there in the media, that often present a biased point of view, subtly or covertly. Second, discuss with people good in understanding arguments. Not just any person who is familiar with philosophy or critical thinking, because such a person may not be a good arguer, or someone who understands argument. Third, practice. With increasing practice breeds familiarity, and you will be good over time naturally. Doing nothing leads to no improvement and subsequently, nothing. 

The answer is (B) all sensuous mental processes are sensuous contents. At this point in Ideas, Husserl has qualified his expression as phenomenological description. In the context of apprehending a phenomenon, the content of consciousness is equivalent to act of consciousness. This is because: 

Human being is freedom. The external world is filled with in-itself being. Consciousness is the only anomaly, and consciousness only manifests itself through human being, insofar as we are aware of it. So, the starting point for an account of human being is in the account of the being of consciousness. We know that the being of consciousness is the consciousness of being, and it will follow that the being of consciousness of humans is the consciousness of being human. This consciousness of being human entails a consciousness of consciousness, and the immediately apparent features of consciousness. Conscious is infinite which means that the options for manifestations of human consciousness are infinite. The feature of having an infinite amount of options for the manifestation of one’s consciousness is what Sartre calls freedom. So, we have determined that the human being is freedom and that humans must be aware that their being is freedom. This does not mean that human beings have an essence of freedom. “Man does not exist first in order to be free subsequently; there is no difference between the being of man and his being-free” (BN: 60). Freedom is the reason that human beings do not have an essence. “Human freedom precedes essence in man and makes it possible; the essence of the human being is suspended in freedom” (BN: 60). The freedom of human being manifests itself as the limitless choice of human action. No matter what the situation is, a human being can always choose to act and his action will define his being. Even in extreme situations of coercion (such as being threatened with death), a human being still has the ability to choose his action and to choose the conscious attitude with which he apprehends the world. This ability to choose is actually an inability not to choose. Sartre tells us that “we are a freedom which chooses, but we do not choose to be free” (BN: 623). We are not free beings. We are freedom itself. Citations refer to this translation of Being and Nothingness 

The problem is assuming that Continental Philosophy is a category, which it is not. It's a movement or a tradition. It's a collection of thinkers who influence and reference each other, and who share a common set of concerns and methods. Michael Dorfman has it right when he says that continental philosophy covers all of the categories you mention, but it's a bit more complicated than that. Analytic philosophy is the other major tradition in contemporary philosophy, and you are probably familiar with the categories of philosophy as seen through the analytic lens: epistemology, metaphysics, ethics, and logic, plus various other categories that cut across one or more of the above four. That might be why you find it hard to see how Continental Philosophy fits into those categories. Analytic philosophy has a certain idea of what 'epistemology' is that doesn't quite fit with what continental thinkers think of it. For instance, the central question in analytic epistemology is "What is knowledge?" That doesn't really come across in the continental philosophy. You have similar sounding questions, but they are subtly different, and they aren't approached in the same way. Unfortunately, the best way to understand what I'm talking about is to put your categorizing on hold read up on some Continental thinkers. You'll see that they have similar questions, but their objectives and methods are different enough that they end up looking radically different. 

This is a heavily debated issue and you are not likely to receive a conclusive answer. The question as phrased amounts to "Which view is correct?", but there are strong arguments from either side. I think you will benefit from doing a little research on the topics of Paternalism and Consequentialist Libertarianism, which are the general terms used in philosophy to refer to either standpoint. I have included descriptions of these views and links to places to start below: 

Historically, people with a political agenda tend to select the "philosophical angle" of the thinker whose work is most sympathetic to their objectives and social conditioning. The list I have provided is meant as a starting point and is by no means exhaustive. Hopefully, these will help you to find the "philosophical angle" that works for you. 

Empirically, no. In our imaginations, yes. That is essentially what you have referred to in the conception by children from images and symbols which seem to refer to their existence. You cannot prove an ideal conception conceived purely from objects situated in reality. For one could almost conceive of any imaginary object if we put them together. Consider what David Hume says, that there is a difference between 'matters of fact' and 'relations of ideas', in Chapter 4 in his Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding. To simplify, matters of fact are things that, no matter what word we assign to it, are true in this world because they exist. They are established by evidence, which in turn are presaged upon 'cause and effect'. Relations of ideas are when, based on certain ideas we hold in our mind, establish them to be true by the mere thought of it. This includes mathematical and geometrical ideas, but also ideas we put together from different 'matters of fact'. That is, things that we hold true from evidence. So Santa Claus is a combination of many ideas from evidence put together as an imaginary whole. The idea of a man in a red costume, with his moose and a some 'human' looking elves, are taken from real life. We distort this picture by making this man and his moose fly, jumping into the chimneys of houses, carrying a host of goods into them (even apartments without chimneys), and give him a sense of humor. This is the imaginary picture we transmit to children, through word-of-mouth and images we draw and enact, therefore to them, there is a possibility that this imaginary figure is real, given that the empirical evidence was not told to them truthfully, but turned into a festive season made real. 

Composition. (you guessed it!). The phrase people generally use to describe the fallacious reasoning involved in the fallacy of composition is the untrue statement: "What is true of the part is true of the whole". So, if the "part" is the failed attempt in your example, the "whole" would be the set of all attempts. Just because the part entails failure, it does not follow that the sum of all parts entail failure. Ad hominem - An ad hominem argument is one that is used to discredit a claimant's assertion based on some unrelated negative attribute of the claimant. This is like thinking because someone is wrong once, that they are therefore always wrong, and attacking a claim with an unknown truth value on that basis. This would apply to your example if the particular conclusion drawn is that the subject always fails at making an argument. E.g. "I made a math error, so my math will always be wrong"
