You can find a complete set of Strichartz estimates for the nonradial KG equation in Lemma 3 in this paper by Machihara, Nakanishi and Ozawa. Let me add that, usually, in proofs of local or global well posedness for the wave or KG equation, the non-endpoint Strichartz estimates are more than enough. Thus the wider range of admissible indices in the radial case is not very helpful in general. It could be useful in some cases in which you expect for some reason a better result for radial data. 

Great question. Maybe the phenomenon is less surprising if one thinks that there are $\infty$ ways to generalize a question, but just a few of them make some progress possible. I think it is reasonable to say that successful generalizations must embed, consciously or not, a very deep understanding of the problem at hand. They operate through the same mechanism at work in good abstraction, by helping you forget insignificant details and focus on the heart of the matter. An example, which is probably too grandiose to qualify as an answer, since your question seems very specific, is Fredholm theory. At the beginning of last century integral equations were a hot topic and an ubiquitous tool to solve many concrete PDE problems. The theory of linear operators on Banach and Hilbert spaces is an outgrowth of this circle of problems. Now, generalizing from $$ u(x) + \lambda \int _a ^b k(x,s) u(s) ds = f(x) $$ to $$ (I+ \lambda K) u = f $$ makes the problem trivial, and we do it without thinking. But it must have been quite a shock in 1900. 

The case of a half space is a classical result of Seeley (Proc. AMS 15 (1964) 625-626), and your case should be just a corollary, using a suitable partition of unity and local change of variables near the boundary. 

What do you need distributions for? Your request is strange, PDEs are the fundamental application, the origin, and the main source of examples for distribution theory, so no surprise all the books on distributions after a while steer to PDEs. Thus maybe my advice is misguided since I do not understand your needs. Anyway, in my opinion the best introduction to distributions is a nice little collection of exercises written by Claude Zuily some years ago (Problems in distributions, North Holland). If you finish it you will be familiar with all the basic theory and you'll be ready to delve into the intricacies, which can be challenging (see the first volume of Hormander, which is essentially a treatise on distributions, or the fear-inducing first volume of John Horvath with its fourteen different topologies on spaces in duality :) 

You might start by looking at the book by Grisvard (Elliptic problems in nonsmooth domains). For instance, in Theorem 3.1.1.1 he proves a very precise identity which shows basically the following: if you want to estimate ANY second derivative of a function $u$ defined on a domain $\Omega$ in terms of the laplacian $\Delta u$ (i.e., if you want to prove regularity of $u$ from the regularity of $f=\Delta u$), then you can if the boundary is $C^2$, but with a constant depending on the negative part of the curvature of the boundary. Even in the simplest case when $\Omega$ is a nonconvex polygon, you can construct $u$ not in $H^2(\Omega)$ such that $\Delta u$ is in $C^\infty$. 

Let me add to the several excellent answers. From a physicist' point of view, a concept like 'the value of a field at a point' does not have much meaning, or at least it can certainly not be measured. One can measure averages (norms), over several experiments, and over regions of space. Thus it makes more physical sense to work in the framework of distribution theory, and Sobolev spaces like $L^2$ or $H^1$, rather than of continuous functions. For instance, particles are represented by probability distributions, and their mass or energy is represented by suitable norms of such distributions. I would venture to say: if a result is only true for (say) $C^2$ but not rougher quantities, then it is unlikely to have much physical meaning. 

I love this one: Harald Bohr was such a good soccer player that he was member of the Danish national team at the 1908 Olympiads. Two years later he got his PhD (apparently there was a large crowd at the event, a quite unusual occurrence for the math department) and went on to become a famous mathematician. 

I like this one, invented by T.Clausen in 1827: since $e^{2\pi i n}=1$ for all integers $n$, we have $e^{2\pi i n+1}=e$, which implies $e^{(2\pi i n+1)^2}=(e^{2\pi i n+1})^{2\pi i n+1}=e^{2\pi i n+1}=e$. Now expanding the square at the exponent gives $$e^{1-4\pi^2n^2+4\pi n i}=e$$ and after simplifying $$e^{-4\pi^2n^2}=1$$ for all $n$. 

An addendum to Deanne Yang's answer. Actually, if a linear hyperbolic equation is degenerate, meaning that the characteristic roots are real but not distinct, then the inverse operator presents a loss of derivatives, meaning that it takes $H^s$ to $H^{s-m}$ for some $m>0$. This is an actual phenomenon and not a defect of the estimates. Indeed, the solution of the 1D equation $u_{tt} âˆ’ t^2 u_{xx} = (4k+1) u_x $ can be written explicitly for integer $k$ and loses exactly $k$ derivatives (this was proved by Qi Min-you in 1958). Thus the inverse of a degenerate hyperbolic equation is a perfect example of a smooth tame map, and the Nash-Moser theorem can be used to handle the nonlinear equations. I used myself this idea in a couple of papers. EDIT: I lost track of the hardcopy of QMY's paper, which I had at some point, anyway from my notes the solution with initial data 0 and $\phi(x)$ should be $$u(t,x)=\sum_{j=1}^{k} \frac{\sqrt{\pi}t^{2j}}{j!(k-j)!\Gamma(j+1/2)} \phi^{(j)}(x+t^{2}/2).$$ EDIT 2: Wait: in section 6 of this paper the example is extended to a more general class of equations. 

For an operator of the form $L=\partial_t-\sum A_{jk}\partial_j\partial_k$, the fundamental solution is computed in Section 3.3 of Volume I of Hormander's treatise (The Analysis of Linear PDOs). I think one may try to extend the formula to include lower order terms by playing with it a little; for instance if $u$ solves $Lu=0$, then $v = e^{-at}u$ solves $Lv+av=0$, and similarly $v=(a_1x_1+\dots+a_nx_n)u$ solves an equation with additional first order terms. 

This really sounds like homework. Anyway, try this. We work under the assumption that $A,B$ are entire functions, otherwise everything works the same but the results are local. If $X(z)=u+iv$ is holomorphic, its derivative can be written as $X'(z)=u_x+iv_x$. Now separate real part and imaginary part of your system, what you get is a nice linear system of $2n$ equations for $2n$ unknown functions, in the variable $x$, with $y$ as a parameter. Standard advanced calculus results give you the existence of a smooth global solution, smoothly dependent on the parameter $y$ (don't ask for references, just differentiate the system w.r.to $y$ and repeat). Now do the same trick writing $X'(z)=v_y-iu_y$: you get another set of $2n$ smooth functions. But of course $X'(z)=AX+B=u_x+iv_x=v_y-iu_y$ which means that $u,v$ satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann conditions and $X$ is holomorphic. 

In harmonic analysis one frequently defines a modification of $f$ by taking the new value $f(x)$ as the limiti of averages of $f$ over balls centered at $x$, with radius tending to 0. You do this at every point for which the limit exists. If $f$ is equivalent to a continuous function, this method produces the continuous representative. By Lebesgue differentiation this limit exists at almost every $x$ and coincides with the original value of $f(x)$ for any locally $L^1$ function; of course it remains the question of how to redefine $f$ at points where the limit do not exist; maybe one can set $f=0$ there. I guess you can not do better than this, but I might be wrong since I do not know lifting theory. 

Indeed, from a mathematical point of view, turbulence is what happens to a solution of Navier-Stokes when it develops a singularity. And we do not know that the solution exists to begin with. So turbulence is the regime where something which we are not sure to exist ceases to exist. Quite shady, isn't it :) More seriously, there have been some attempts to model turbulence. I think one basic problem is that it is not even clear what exactly one should model. Does it make sense to describe the fluid by a field $u(t,x)$, surely a very singular one, governed by some PDE? A classical discussion of this problem is in Chapter III of the sixth volume of Landau-Lifshitz' treatise, and there are some more recent books entirely devoted to this question. 

Your idea reminds me of a standard construction which is often used to prove the existence of a completion of an arbitrary metric space. If a metric space $X$ is bounded, you can embed it into the Banach space $C_b(X;R)$ of bounded continuous functions from $X$ to $R$: simply identify $x\in X$ with the function $f_x(y)=d(x,y)$. If $X$ is not bounded it is easy to modify this construction: fix a reference point $x_0$ and define $f_x(y)=d(x,y)-d(x_0,y)$. 

Not sure if this qualifies since it is a whole theory, but distribution theory is in essence the consequence of a particularly well chosen definition.
