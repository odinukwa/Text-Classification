If you require a home Super Bowl to be one that takes place at the home stadium of the team, then Minnesota has gotten the closest: They lost the conference championship game, only one game away from a home Super Bowl. A team entering the playoffs in a year that its stadium was hosting the Super Bowl has happened 8 times: 

In the early 2000s, the NFL felt that touchdown celebrations had gotten out of control, delaying the game and promoting unsportsmanlike behavior. Some of the top "offenders" included Steve Smith (who "diapered and wiped" the football), Randy Moss (who mooned Packers fans at Lambeau) and Chad Johnson (who put on a hall of fame jacket and proposed to a cheerleader). So in 2006, the NFL outlawed "excessive celebration." Specifically, players were prohibited from any prolonged, excessive, or premeditated celebration, from using any type of prop while celebrating, from going to the ground during a celebration, and from engaging in a group celebration. However, they clarified that the Lambeau Leap would still be allowed, as long as it was one player only that jumped.* Essentially, the Leap was grandfathered in as a celebration. The goal post dunk was also grandfathered in at the time, but in 2014 that was banned as well. The 2006 celebration ban was not popular with the players or fans. And many players and fans were upset that the Packers were the only ones with a celebration that was still allowed, while their players were prohibited from celebrating. This year (2017), the NFL has made a rule change again; this time, it has relaxed the excessive celebration rules. Players are now once again allowed to use the football as a prop, to celebrate on the ground, and to engage in group demonstrations. Offensive or prolonged celebrations, or demonstrations directed at an opponent, are still against the rules and will result in a penalty. Before this year, it was debatable whether or not a Lambeau Leap-style celebration was within the rules at other stadiums. Players have attempted it in other stadiums, and it is usually not flagged, as long as it follows all the other rules (no props, no groups). With the new rule changes, a Lambeau Leap-style celebration should be allowed now in any stadium without question. 

Yes, a bounce that goes into the basket would count as a successful goal. Anytime (except on a throw-in) a live ball goes through the basket, it is a goal, and it doesn't matter who, if anyone, threw the ball. From the NCAA Men's Basketball 2013-14 and 2014-15 Rules, Rule 5 (Scoring and Timing Regulations), Section 1, Article 2: 

Chapter 5, Part II of the Olympic Charter covers the rules regarding participation in the Olympic Games. The actual details of the requirements for qualifying for the Olympics varies by sport, but the Charter discusses the general procedure. Each country in the Olympics has their own National Olympic Committee (NOC) that is responsible for assembling the team from their country. Each sport in the Olympics is governed by an International Federation (IF) that is recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as governing that particular sport. For example, athletics (track and field) is governed by the International Association of Athletics Federations. The IF typically has affiliated National Federations (NF) in each country. These federations hold national and international competitions apart from the Olympics. The NF makes recommendations to the NOC as to who should represent their country in the Olympics. The NOC then approves or disapproves of the recommendations and submits the applications for these athletes to the Organizing Committee of the Olympic Games (OCOG) for the current Games. The NOC can only submit applications for athletes that have been recommended by the NF. If it is a small country that does not have an NF for a sport, the NOC can submit athletes with the approval of the IF and the OCOG, but the IF must approve the athletes before they will be allowed in the Games. The OCOG and the IOC have the right to refuse any entry they want from the games, for any reason. All participants have to agree to abide by the Olympic rules and the World Anti-Doping Code. 

8-Ball is a very popular game worldwide. However, as you noted in your question, there are competing sets of rules. Unlike other sports, there is no single authority for pool that sets the rules for this game. 

Update 1/2016: The Rams, Chargers, and Raiders all applied to move to LA this year. The NFL has approved the move for the Rams, who will start playing in LA this year (2016) at the Coliseum while their new stadium in Inglewood is built, which is scheduled for completion in time for the 2019 season. The stadium is designed to support two teams; the Chargers will be given an opportunity to move, and if they decide against it, the Raiders will be allowed to move. Source: LA Times Update 1/2017: The Chargers opted to move to LA, and will begin playing at StubHub Center in Carson until the Inglewood stadium, which is now named City of Champions Stadium, is completed in 2019. 

During the Super Bowl LI last night, the FOX commentators mentioned that a punt has never been returned for a touchdown during a Super Bowl. My first thought was of Desmond Howard in Super Bowl XXXI, but my wife reminded me that that was a kickoff return, not a punt return. (She was absolutely right, as usual.) That 99-yard kickoff return for a touchdown helped earn Howard the Super Bowl MVP that year. It turns out that a Super Bowl kickoff return score has happened at least one more time, during Super Bowl XLVII (for 108 yards!). But that got me wondering: Which happens more often: a kickoff return for a touchdown, or a punt return for a touchdown? And why? 

There are a couple of reasons why professional baseball players' salaries are public. Baseball employs a luxury tax rule that penalizes teams when the salaries are too high. The salaries need to be made public in order for this system to work. Other sports have salary cap rules which also require public knowledge of the athletes' salaries. Professional sports are entertainment, and part of the fun in sports is the fans scrutinizing decisions made by the team management. Giving the fans knowledge about the salary implications of various signing decisions helps fans understand the reasons why certain decisions are made. You mention that you think it is unfair for the athletes to have their performance be compared to the size of their contract. But indirectly, the athletes work for the fans. Being a professional athlete is a public job, and taking criticism is part of that job. When it comes to their job, including their salary, they are not entitled to privacy. Athletes are not alone in having their salaries made public. In fact, the salaries for most public figures, including movie stars, politicians, government employees, and corporate management, are public knowledge.
