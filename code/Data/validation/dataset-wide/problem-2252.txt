To answer the question about hand sanitizer and sunscreen: There seems to be no specific testing of these substances on climbing rope. Use your judgement, but I see no reason to think that hand sanitizer or sunscreen would pose any threat to rope if it does not contain any of the above-mentioned damaging substances. Hand-sanitizer typically contains alcohol, moisturizers, and fragrance. Sunscreen typically contains a UV-inhibiter like titanium dioxide or zinc oxide, moisturizers, and fragrance. None of these substances is listed as harmful to nylon or climbing rope by rope manufactures or the UIAA. 

My opinion is no, you can't ever be certain that all bears of all species are inactive where you are. And besides, they aren't the only animals of concern. Some reasons for no leeway: 

However, purchasing these parts would take a call to customer service of Cascade Designs, as they are not available through standard channels. Though your local MSR outdoor retailer may be able to order these parts for you. The real issue is going to be whether the cost of these parts is actually much cheaper than buying the WLU. Either way, it does seem possible to convert at least the current generation WLI into a WLU. 

Personal anecdote: I was backpacking on the Appalachian Trail in Grayson Highlands State Park near Mount Rogers in the winter several years ago. There was probably two feet of snow or more everywhere. We didn't hang bear bags. What got into our food? Wild ponies. Yep. Wild ponies. Who knew. 

MSR Whisperlite Repair Kit: While the MSR wick is a different shape and design (the little beige sleeve), it still serves the same purpose and is the same material. 

Sometimes you don't have a place to submerge your pad to find leaks, or it's just too cumbersome to do so. Here is a method for leak-finding that can be done at home or in the field: 

It's been a dream of mine to thru-hike the AT ever since I first discovered it. I'm hoping to plan a trip one of these days, but honestly don't even know where to start as far cost. I imagine it could vary quite a bit, depending on what kind of equipment you use, what type of food, how often you stay in hostels ...other relevant criteria... So, some guidelines should help this along. I'm thinking three rough figures or ranges of cost are what I'm looking for: 

There are a nearly overwhelming number of trekking pole reviews out there so to help direct this question, I'm really looking for answers from those who have owned or used both types of poles thus having their experiences with them informing those answers. Any possible studies out there would also be welcome information. 

Prevention: Make every effort to keep your feet dry in the first place. Sometimes it's just inevitable though. Absorb excess water: After removing your insoles, use a highly absorbent synthetic shammy (like those for drying cars) to pat down and dry the footwear by hand as much as possible, wringing out the shammy frequently. A typical camp towel will work, but not nearly as effectively. Repeat until no more water is absorbed into the shammy. Likewise, take your wet socks, roll them up in the shammy and wring the whole thing out. Repeat until no more water wrings out. Controlled application of heat: If still hiking, return the boots with insoles back to your feet and continue on. The heat from your feet will do a lot to dry your boots, but only if you've removed most of the water by absorbing it. Don't put fresh socks on yet. (Obviously if the boots still will be getting wet then don't bother drying them until you can get to camp.) When at camp, after absorbing the majority of the water, wear the boots around while setting up camp, cooking, etc. so that your body heat can continue to work on moving the moisture out. I'd recommend dry socks for this part, but no socks could also work if it's warm enough. 

This is not a shopping question just to preface that issue. I'm not looking for a specific brand or model of trekking pole. Also to add some background information, I have borrowed trekking poles once, but do not own any. They are a rather new thing for me to consider as I've been a bit stubbornly (and maybe irrationally) opposed to them until I began to have knee pain as I grow older. There are several trekking pole manufacturers, and they all seem to have a myriad of options and models. One of those major categories is the Anti-Shock, (hereafter known as "AS"), or shock-absorbing models. These poles use different methods to reduce the amount of force transferred to your hands and arms upon the poles' strike with the ground. Well, at least that's my understanding anyway. Standard poles do not have this mechanism. So my question is what are the pros & cons of each: AS versus Standard trekking poles? Just a few of the the things I'm wondering about as a jumping off point: 

The organization I work with has used NOLS Wilderness Medicine Institute for training in Wilderness First Aid for several years until this past one when we switched to American Red Cross's Wilderness & Remote First Aid course. We have our own staff that are now ARC instructors is the reason for the switch. I can honestly say that NOLS WFA compared to ARC WRFA is very, very similar. There are some different takes on how to handle certain situations, and in some ways WRFA covers more material. However you can't go wrong with either one as they both will teach valuable skills. Both are essentially two day courses and require a current CPR certification for your certification to be valid (it can be taken after the WFA course.) I noticed you linked to the Wilderness First Responder course on the NOLS site. I can't speak for that level of training, since I haven't taken WFR yet, but hope to do so before next summer. Though I can say this: I know and have worked with several people with WFR certifications through NOLS WMI and can vouch that they are very well prepared to handle backcountry emergencies. An important thing to note is that ARC doesn't offer an equivalent to WFR. I don't have any experience with SOLO or Wilderness Medical Associates so I can't compare those, but I'm sure they are excellent organizations as well. You first need to decide what level of training you want to get. That will help you decide which organization to go with. If you're just testing the waters or just want a solid foundation then I would recommend taking a WFA course. You can still go up if you think you need more training later and it covers a lot of material. However if you are out in the middle of nowhere quite often and you plan an being very prepared then I recommend taking a much more involved WFR course. If you're in the outdoors for a living then WEMT might even be something to consider, although it also involves becoming an EMT. 

I've done plenty of camping in my life, especially since it's part of my job, but one area where I've been particularly challenged is camping where sand is involved. It just gets everywhere and into everything and can become quite miserable quickly if not managed well. It almost seems impossible to keep it from getting into all my gear. (And sand coupled with saltwater and high humidity are quite the team of irritants.) What are some fool-proof techniques, habits, or equipment for minimizing the invasion of sand when camping on or near the beach (or other sandy areas)? What are some good ways in the field to get rid of it once it has already gotten into your gear? Theoretical ideas are good, but I'm really looking for answers that speak from experience. 

Nylon, among other synthetics, is an ideal material for clothing for most outdoor pursuits for several reasons. I will use the example of cotton as the traditional fabric for comparison: 

So this is one of those things that I've grown so accustomed to that I've not really put any effort or thought into looking for a solution. I've just "dealt with it" to the point of ignoring it for so long now. Almost all rain jackets provide an adjustable cuff via velcro or other means to cinch up around the wrist, but this barely impedes the invasion of moisture at that point. What is a method or piece of gear that will prevent water from dripping down the hands and wrist into the cuffs of a rain jacket when hands are horizontal or reaching above? Gloves are a quick thought but they will capture water when your hands are down and are unlikely to be worn in warm weather. Just to head this one off: please no "buy a new rain jacket" answers. Even the best rain jackets will have this problem. 

However my personal recommendation is forget the built-in igniter and keep the lighter (or other external ignition source), which has multiples uses, weighs very little, and is easily replaceable. The small built-in piezo-electric igniters all wear out rather quickly. I have a stove with one that no longer works and have friends with JetBoils with the same problem. Also the replacement igniter is only $5.95. So in my opinion it's not worth trying fix the old one for that price if you don't want to depend on a lighter. 

On trips I lead, we always split up into smaller cook groups, yet I did have one occasion a long time ago where we cooked as one large cook group. Long enough that I don't remember if it worked well or not. (I don't think that it did, but we also could have done something wrong.) On extended trips into the wilderness, whether it be backpacking, kayak trips, etc, what are the advantages of cooking together as one entire group? Conversely, what about the advantages of splitting up into smaller cook groups? Would the type of trip, and environment be a factor in the advantages? Let's say we have a group size of 9 people, and the trip is 10 days, no resupplies, and it is a temperate, forested environment. 

(Note the location: in a crease that is repeatedly stressed, being by the valve. Also note the difference between bubbles from suds and the bubble from the leak.) 

Red River Gorge is one of my favorite places I've climbed and I've only been in the summer months. Yes it is more humid, but it's not unbearable, though I'm from the Southeast so I'm a bit used to that. I found that I still enjoyed the climbing enough that I don't remember being bothered by the weather conditions. In fact I think the evenings were a bit cool in August. In short, it's humid and somewhat buggy, but still very much worth it. 

"The hangboard (aka fingerboard) is a popular training tool for climbers, as it addresses the weakest link to the rock: the fingers." 

See also the guide from Mammut. Another reference that is too lengthy is from Black Diamond. It discusses the effect of urine on rope strength, which is surprisingly quite bad. (This article is no longer available, however this article references the preliminary testing done by Black Diamond.) 

Bears and other wildlife are attracted to unusual scents, especially anything that could potentially be mistaken as food, such as often-sweet-smelling, aromatic pipe tobacco or cigars. However, you're essentially just burning the material and just creating smoke. And animals general aren't attracted to fire or smoke. I can imagine this one going either way, and I haven't really found a definitive answer anywhere. Personal experience leads me to think it's generally safe, but I'm only one person in one region, in one country. Could smoking pipe tobacco or a cigar attract bears and/or other wildlife? Especially predators? If so, what specifically is the main danger: the unsmoked tobacco, the vaporizing of the tobacco through smoking, or the leftovers? I know that this could lead into a conversation about smoking anything, but for the sake of this one, let's keep it to aromatic tobacco smoking, not including cigarettes. 

First do a proper assessment and determine that it's actually a dislocation and not another problem or that there isn't also another injury in addition to the dislocation. This requires the proper training which is beyond the scope of this medium. This is not a substitute for proper training. So you've done the assessment and there are no life-threatening issues or other injuries to complicate treatment of the dislocation. If possible, it needs to be reduced, which means you want to get the shoulder back in its proper place. There are several techniques for this, but the primary one being taught in Wilderness First Aid classes is called the Stimson maneuver: 

taken from MSR WLU product manual As you know, the WLU is the newest iteration of this famous stove that is compatible with not only multiple liquid fuels, but also canister fuels. To achieve this the WLU departs in design from the WLI by having two adapters on the fuel line: one to connect to a canister and one to connect to the traditional MSR pump. This means the WLU's fuel line and generator tube are different parts from the WLI. The WLU has a UC jet that is designed for use with canisters in addition to the liquid fuel UK and UG jets used for both stoves. (The older model WLI uses different jets than the current model WLI.) The WLU also includes a canister stand for more efficient burning in cold weather and with low fuel. So theoretically a WLI could be converted to a WLU with the following parts: 

This is not an exhaustive list of the attributes of nylon, but provides the main reason it is a "go to" fabric for outdoor gear. Polyester has similar characteristics to nylon and is another mainstream synthetic fabric. Merino Wool is a natural, renewable material that offers many of these same benefits that nylon does, with the exception of the superior durability provided by nylon. 

Fill a squirt bottle, spray bottle, hydration bladder (something with a nozzle to control the flow) with water near to the top. Add several drops of liquid soap (dish detergent works best). Wet your fully inflated sleeping pad with the mixture. Look for bubbles forming to isolate the leak(s). Carefully mark the location of the leak with a needle/pin (you've got to fix the leak anyway) as you will lose it as soon as you rinse the soapy water away. You may try a grease pencil or china marker but not much else will write on a soapy wet surface. (Note that a grease pencil or china marker can leave residue which can impede adhesion of the patch. If you use one of those, make your reference marks outside of the range of where the patch will go. A pin or needle is best.) Rinse the area to be patched of the soapy water. Let the pad dry and follow your procedure for repairing the leak!
