One perspective not mentioned in other answers is that going through the bardo is a traumatic experience. This is the primary reason for not maintaining memory between rebirths. The other primary reason being that memories are a physical aspect of the brain. That being said, karmic seeds are said to grow, not just naturally, but also because of psychological propensity to repeat the same actions. I am not sure if it is said that these propensities carry from life to life, or just the karma from them. It seems that it in some way must. Not identity though... but a type of personna or personality. However now I get off topic, so I will cease my ramblings. 

Slightly reworded your question, but the answer is they are not close at all. Those scenarios would require action of body, speech, and mind. Doing them in real life would have much vaster karmic effect. 

Some do get married! It just depends on the tradition. In the 2005 article "I married a monk" the excerpt below speaks of some notable examples 

I used to meditate daily, about 2 or 3 years ago I stopped. A week ago I decided to start meditating again. I sat down closed my eyes... and suddenly I am halfway through cleaning my dishes. So I try again sit down close my eyes, and I am doing laundry. I don't consciously see myself stopping and starting these chores. I completely space out on what is going on and "come to" doing a chore or task. What is going on? I have never had this problem before, and normally consider myself to be pretty mindful. 

These are just some situational conditions, reasons for watching, and reaction to the video determines the karma. Each has its own separate effect. 

You could say some mantras for your friend, and dedicate the merit of your day to them on a day where your practice is well done. 

Keep in mind that dreams are your conscious and subconscious talking, they are essentially you speaking to yourself and can reveal how you feel about things on the subconscious level. The Bardo of the dream state is said to be "double-deluded" meaning our day to day lives are an illusion, but the dream state is doubly so. However, there is a Tibetan practice called dream yoga that turns the doublely deluded dream state into an opportunity to practice 

To add to the other answers here, the wrathful Buddhas are often seen as protectors. Mahākāla for instance is just another form of Avalokiteśvara. He (mahakala) is considered the tantric "watchdog", protecting those that appropriately practice Vajrayana, but is said to turn quickly on those that misuse those teachings. Another well known wrathful diety is Vajrapani 

No it is a recording, you do not take on the karma of the criminal or the victim. You only gain knowledge that the event occurred. 

If you walked in to a room and heard a sentence that might be out of context you might want to hold off on accusing someone of spreading the wrong view 

He has a total of 33 forms, including the wrathful form of Mahakala He is also considered to be the "parent" of Tara 

This is true, but karma is not always from this life, karma can manifest in lifetimes after the life it is planted in. 

Bodhisattvahood, is not really a quality, at least not in the sense you are saying. A Bodhisattva is a being striving to reach enlightenment as quickly as possible, for the benefit of all beings. They have a set of vows that they must take and keep. They are similar to monks, except their vows are of a different variety. I think you are thinking of the term Ahrat, or someone who has obtained nirvana. Yet the two terms are related in a way. The thing about a realization of Śūnyatā, at least in the teachings I have heard, is that you know, there is no doubt. This is of course a direct understanding I refer to, not an intellectual theoretical understanding. Those who experience it directly do not have to ask for a clarification. As for your personal experience, don't get me wrong, it is your experience. What value it has is not for others to determine. You must decide what impact to let it have on you. I spent years chasing after answers after an experience I had in my teenage years, and though I learned a ton about myself, and many other things, ultimately I came to the conclusion that the experience was a dead end, and not to pursue it further. One Rinpoche who I went to talk to about the experience advised me to just passively watch and observe if it were to happen again. He explained to me about how when he was a boy he had to reach out and touch objects to ensure that they were really there. Now just because my experience was a dead end does not necessarily mean yours was. There are two possibilities, it was a genuine experience, or it was somehow related to your condition. Either way, it is your mind, and you can analyze it as an aspect of yourself. Where you go from here, and what you decide to do with the experience and the memory of it though, is completely up to you. 

In the oral Tibetian Buddhist traditions this is a common belief. The logic that is normally presented is this : 

While this was not exactly your problem the two are similar. Another advice I've received from a past teacher is to rotate my meditation types. Do each for about a month, and then rotate to the next one. Sometimes practice goes well, sometimes it does not. When it does not, watch your mind even in its reaction to the practice. Do not cling to any expected result, just accept what is... Even though it is not a buddhist text I'll quote the Bhagavad Gita here as it is relavent. 

While working with these energies you will experience a period where the karma you are working with ripens quickly, the purification process is not easy, and you will experience suffering directly related to the karma you are working with. To wrap this up a quick quote from the Diamond Cutter Sutra and one from Tai Situ Rinpoche. 

You take the cause of the karma you are working with, remember all the times you did it, realize that it is going to cause you suffering. Regret that you commited the deeds in question. The 3rd step is called "Restraint force" Here you take the cause of the karma you are working with, and you restrain yourself from doing it again. The longer you can restrain yourself the better. 

Some monks and bodhisattvas have vowed that they will always point sentient beings towards the ethical life in their endeavours. I am not as familiarized with the monk vows, but do know that bodhisattvas are supposed to always practice and encourage generosity. As long as the generosity does not stem from some motivation from pride, greed, or anger. This goes for other types of skillful means as well. This nearly always has to be broken down situationally. However the motive and intent of the deed matter. Let's say a monk named Simon is seeking a donation to their monastery. The place is close to bankrupt and needs money and supplies to stay afloat this winter. Food and proper heat for its occupants could be achieved at the fraction of the cost if a few nearby businesses partner with the monks in need. Simon benifits from this, so does the sangha he resides with. The monk being able to act as diplomat between the outside communities and the Abbot or head monk is serving more than just himself. Say he reaches an agreement and the monks will do a sand mandala on such dates and area, in exchange for food the businesses in the area normally would throw out, but was good to eat, as well as a percentage of the sales on those dates to cover Monastery utilities and normal operating costs. If the monk asks and encourages generosity, and follows through with the intended uses of the benefits. I would say it would be ok, and, in most Buddhist circles, perfectly acceptable. It also would not be frowned on by outsiders. However, on the flip side, if Simon instead panhandles only for himself, seeking more than the food needed for survival, or under some fully self centered desire , say drugs or alchohol. Even though encouraging genoristy, he is not a monk but a con man. The scope of the deed, and the motive behind it matter, and so does the outcome. If Simon is skimming profits for alcoholic beverages (not in the original agreement, approved by the head monk, or known to parties involved) then no, their encouraging generosity is just a type of deception. Uncovering of such facts would be frowned on by most circles, and outside parties as well. 

One of my favorite lines from Vasitha's yoga "I am not, nor is there other, nor is there nonexistence." In what ways does this parallel with Buddhist thought? In what ways does it differ? 

In the Jataka tales (Similar to Aseop's Fables ) there are many stories about the Buddha's various past lives. These are tales for children and normally come with a moral. There are a ton of them, and they normally end with the animal the Buddha is reborn as helping out in someway that is aligned with the teachings. You can see a few of them summarized quickly without the entire back plot of a fable here. It is absolutely correct that in the Buddhist worldview a human rebirth is of great advantage. Animal existence is not what most of us would consider fun. As one teacher once reminded me, you might be a pet, or you might be reborn a deer in a forest of wolves. An animal life is mainly fear and instinct. The characteristic of their realm is that of Ignorance. As you yourself pointed out, your dog (Who is lucky and has food, shelter, and someone looking out for them) is not often reflective. Anger the characteristic of the hell realms is more damaging, and can lead to a large snake on the game of chutes and ladders. Your dog though, in your ownership, is likely not accumulating massive amounts of negative karma. I hope this helped to answer your question.
