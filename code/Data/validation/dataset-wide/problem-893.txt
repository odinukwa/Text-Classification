Short answer is: yes. Longer answer is: correcting for the time dilation effects of Earth moving around the Sun's gravitational potential is actually relatively standard in almost all branches of astronomy. To the point where running that correction is a sentence in a paper (sometimes less), and is probably why you had trouble Googling for it. (I'll caveat all this by saying I'm mostly familiar with exoplanet transit and RV timing issues, but they should be the same as what the pulsar folks have to deal with). As some background, the base time-keeping system used around the world is International Atomic Time (TAI), which is a weighted average of over 300 atomic clocks determined by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures outside of Paris. Importantly, TAI is strictly continuous: there are no leap seconds added. This is important if you care about sub-second timing precision. What we use as normal "clock" time is Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), which is TAI with leap seconds subtracted off. Those leap seconds are present to deal with the fact that 86,400 SI seconds are 1 to 3 milliseconds less than one mean Solar day, and so ensure that our clock time is linked to the position of the Sun. The most recent leap second was added just this past New Year's, making UTC = TAI - 37 seconds. Even further down the time-keeping rabbit hole is Barycentric Dynamic Time (TDB), which accounts for the variable relativistic time dilation over the course of a year that you asked about. TDB has a fixed offset from TAI of 32.184 seconds due to how the zero-points of the the two systems were defined, and otherwise stays within 1.6 milliseconds of TAI - depending upon where Earth is in its orbit. Effectively all precise times reported by astronomers these days are the barycentric Julian date in the Barycentric Dynamic Time system (BJD_TDB). This is the Julian date an event would appear to happen for an observer located at the Solar System's barycenter using TDB as their timekeeping system. Note that the fact this is at the SS barycenter does matter, since observations on Earth will see similar events up to ~16 minutes apart over the course of the year due to light-travel time delay (Roemer Delay, for the aficionados) across the Earth's orbit. So yeah, this all has to be accounted for all the time. As I said, these days the transformation is standard enough that you usually just list a time as "BJD_TDB" and don't have to explicitly discuss the transformation. For more reading about astronomical timekeeping, see Eastman et al. (2010). PS - In case you're wondering why Barycentric Dynamic Time is abbreviated TDB and Coordinated Universal Time is UTC, it's because we all use the French abbreviations. 

Roughly speaking, the moon's orbit has a semi-major axis of about 400,000 km. The semi-major axis of the Earth's orbit is 149.6 million km. The intensity of sunlight received by the Moon depends on the inverse of the square of the distance, so the difference amounts to $((1.496e8 + 4e5)/(1.496e8 - 4e5))^2$ = 1.011, or about 1%. So, not very much. The variation in Earth's distance from the Sun is about five million km, so that's going to have more of an effect than the lunar orbit itself (as Chappo pointed out in their comment). That works out to a variation of about 6.9% in insolation from perihelion to aphelion. The maximum possible variation -- full moon at aphelion versus new moon at perihelion -- would be $((1.521e8 + 4e5)/(1.471e8 - 4e5))^2$, which works out to about 8.1%. The difference in insolation from new moon to full moon at perihelion is about 1.09%, versus a difference of 1.06% at aphelion. 

From a quick skim of the paper, it appears they using data from a previous paper by Smartt et al. (2009). That paper compiled a sample of observed supernovae (SNe) for which there are good images of the parent galaxies taken before the actual SNe. In some cases, Smartt et al. found plausible progenitor stars for the SNe; those are the "detections". Cases where they couldn't find a plausible progenitor on pre-SN images are the "non-detections". (The authors of the paper you are talking about appear to be suggesting that Smartt et al. underestimated the masses of progenitor stars because they failed to account for extra local dust extinction from the more massive red supergiant stars.) 

China is pretty well integrated into modern astronomy -- there are regular international conferences held in China (the most recent General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union was held in Beijing in 2012), lots of Chinese astronomers at other international conferences, Chinese participation in international observatory projects (the Joint Institute for VLBI, the Thirty Meter Telescope, the Square Kilometer Array, etc.), and so forth. I'm not sure I'd say they have any really significant facilities yet (with the possible exception of LAMOST), but they have very ambitious plans, as you've noted. (ITAR has very little to do with astronomy except when it comes to a few things like nuclear physics codes produced by places like Los Alamos.) I don't know how much international participation is anticipated for the FAST project, though I gather the instrument development has some involvement from British and Australian institutes, so they'd likely get some time. Yes, results from the Changâ€™E-3 mission have been published in scientific papers, e.g. $URL$ There are several Chinese astronomy journals (e.g., Acta Astronomica Sinica; Research in Astronomy and Astrophysics), but like most "national" journals they aren't that important internationally. 

Hipparcos measured the parallax (distance) of stars, along with their colors in two wavelength regions (B_Tycho, "blue" and V_Tycho, "green"). Using the color information you can make a reasonable estimate for the stellar temperature, and coupled with the parallactic distance, this would allow you to get an estimate for the stellar radius. But Hipparcos does not provide us with any good information about stellar metallicities, ages*, radial velocity, rotation, or surface gravity. * - aside from stars that you can group in position and velocity space to identify as belonging to stellar moving groups with defined ages. 

I'll begin by saying that for exoplanets, the answer to your question is an active area of research, and currently there are no observational constraints on what rocky exoplanets would look like to the human eye. Also, this may be a lot more complicated an answer than what you want for a computer game. If you want to hunt around for this in the astronomical or planetary science literature, what you're trying to do is determine the reflectance, or albedo spectrum, of the planet. That's what tells you how much of the incoming light is bounced back off the surface for you to see as function of wavelength. Note that this assumes the planet is not hot enough to thermally emit in the optical, which will only start to matter if it's >3000K or so. This albedo spectrum is determined by the surface properties of the planet: what it's made out of, how shiny it is, the scattering properties, etc. Once you have an albedo spectrum, you then can multiply it be the incoming radiation from whatever primary star you've chosen. That's what will make a planet seem slightly more orange around an M-dwarf, and more "normal" around a Sun-like star. To get to how a person would see it, you'd then need to then multiply that resulting reflected-light spectrum by the spectral sensitivity of the human eye, and then convert that final observed spectrum into a color. For the planetary albedo spectrum, there aren't a lot of sources in the astronomical literature. The best I can find is this paper. You'll probably have more luck looking through Solar System planetary stuff. For the stellar spectra, you can try here, but that presumes you're comfortable with astronomical FITS files. For stars hotter than >4500K (the Sun is 5800K), you can probably just assume that the incoming radiation into the planet's surface is blackbody of whatever temperature you want. Unfortunately, I am not familiar with the spectral sensitivity of the human eye, or how to go from an input observed spectrum to a single color value. 

The "Schechter-like" Equation 3 in that paper is meant to give the value of black-hole mass density in units of "number of black holes of a particular mass per volume per log black hole mass", with the volume in units of megaparsecs and the "log black hole mass" in units of 0.1 log solar-mass units -- i.e., 0.1 dex. Since the integral involves multiplying by $d \log M_{\rm BH}$, you are multiplying $(\log M_{\rm BH})^{-1}$ by $\log M_{\rm BH}$, and thus the "dex" units do indeed cancel out. As for the exact value, you're going to have trouble reproducing that. First of all, the value from the text that you quoted ("5.06") is the result when they integrate over all BH masses, not just the $10^6$ to $10^{10}$ limits in Equation 4. From their Table 3, the relevant comparison value would be 4.9 if you're just doing the integration in Equation 4. Second, the values they quote in Table 3 (and in the text for the full integration) are apparently not straightforward computations from their Equation 4 (or from the full integral). They go through a complicated exercise of computing this value 10001 times, each time tweaking the input coefficients of Equation 1, then applying some more using random Gaussian deviations, so they end up with a distribution of BH density values, not just a single one. They say 

That sounds... confused, or else just wrong. Negative pressure is what causes inflation: something (inflaton field, cosmological constant, or "dark energy" in general) with an energy density that stays approximately constant as space expands has negative pressure and will drive the exponential expansion of space. The transition to "true" vacuum is what shuts off inflation, after which you get the standard Big Bang, during which the expansion continues but slows down. (The cosmological constant -- or "dark energy" -- also has negative pressure, and so the universe is gradually moving towards a state where the space between galaxy groups and galaxy clusters will again be expanding exponentially.) The "eternal inflation" model has our visible universe -- almost certainly a tiny part of a much larger region of true vacuum -- as one of many such pockets of true vacuum embedded within a vastly larger false vacuum that's still expanding exponentially.
