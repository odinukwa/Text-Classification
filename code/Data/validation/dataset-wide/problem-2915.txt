The proof found on the example uses a formal artifice, not difficult to follow. Anyway, to simplify it, you can express it as this "if it rains, the moon is made of cheese". Since on a contradiction you have that false=true, you can use the true side: "true, then, the moon is made of cheese". Of course, you can justify any proposition based on such logic. Isolated, this fallacy seems a trivial game. Nevertheless, if it appears from a result of some kind of normative scheme, it becomes really dangerous. For example, it raises on most religions, since religious books are full of contradictions. Then, you can justify murder, rape or whatever behavior with a simple "God is love for the others, and who does not believe in him will suffer punishment" (fallacy: love is contradictory with punishment). See ex contradictione quodlibet on Wikipedia. 

Time is our perception of change. Time is intrinsic for matter (our perception of nature), but not for fundamental entities (fundamental particles seem to exist in a universe where space and time don't exist): photons doesn't experience time. You will ask how is time only relevant to our perception of matter: "all matter is just interaction" (Feynman). There are theories of interaction in current development, check my profile link. Despite non-intuitive, change seems to be previous to time. You ask how is it possible for change to exist without time during the big bang, you must consider that we don't understand the big bang. But it was not a common Monday. Perhaps we can approach change as a set of photograms in a film. Change is what we see when we roll the movie. It is us that need time to understand change, change is just there. Change does not depend on the projector. This sequence of causal mechanics is what Stephen Hawking relates to physical information. Information is what lies in the photograms. Change is our perception of different states of physical information. Time is our perception of change. There is nothing in physics preventing time to roll backwards. Apparently, it is only our perception which gives us the illusion of a direction of time. 

Thanks for your answers, I think I have the answer. The problem was trying to find a relation of proportionality between entropy and any of the presented features. But I realize now that entropy sustains the 2nd law, and viceversa. In simple words, there is some physically measurable quantity (entropy) that always increases (2nd law) on close systems evolving spontaneously. This, independent of order, enthalpy, and even probabilities. A system can get order, evolve towards a particular state out of the median states, or even concentrate its energy, while entropy reaches a maximum. 

The definition of center is your issue. This is not philosophy or math, this is a rhetoric problem. If center means the axis of rotation and your plane rotates, there is your center. Centers are equidistant points to sets of systems (borders, lines, weights, moving points, etc.). Then it depends. This is like asking if you can think of nothing. It all depends on your definition of thinking. There are no absolute truths on language, where concepts are usually subjective. Only on logic and causality (except that causality has been broken on Q. Physics and we're rebuilding our concepts... Again). 

Perception would have different levels of processing delays, regarding consciousness and the type of perception process. In order to perceive skin damage (as pain), and even to raise a causal reaction to it, you just need a fraction of a second. But that's a subconscious perception and reaction. Not only instincts define quick subconscious reactions to perception. When you drive a car, you learn to apply the brakes as fast as possible when you detect a risk. This is a learned mechanism. Other mental processes involve slower perception. How long did it took you to understand this message? Probably more than 10 seconds. Some interaction learning processes involve longer times: how long will it take to learn how to use photoshop? Such process involves also some particular types of perception, e.g. the perception of the status of the application by means of the graphical user interface. 

Science is just a type of knowledge (obtained via the scientific method). In contrast, there are other types of knowledge: religious knowledge (obtained from ancient books, which were written by mostly ignorant people), empirical knowledge (obtained by the senses), etc. You can assess the validity of an assertion under the light of any type of knowledge. E.g. "is drinking beer good?" Religions might absolutely forbid it. Empirical knowledge would say it is very good above 2 liters, and science would state that a glass per week increases your chances of a long life. So far, as we know, science is the best type of knowledge (even if it is a subjective approach of our occidental, modern society). Scientific knowledge is a very big and complex construct. Therefore Stephen Hawking would be ignorant about other areas of scientific knowledge, other than physics. You cannot expect absorbing all scientific knowledge. But scientific philosophy ensures anyone to access science, and the scientific method allows anyone to challenge and change any part of science. This current trend of mandatory-academicism required to be taken into account to make science is the response to our human tendency to profit from science and degrade it (Popper's pseudoscience) . Though, it is just a type of social corruption. Science should be open and we should be all valid subjects to challenge and change science. The reason for science to be the preferred type of knowledge (as I called it, socially subjective) is that we consider it the best tool to increase our chances for a good life. But such is a trap: what is a good life? For us, occidental people, it means a long life. For other oriental cultures, it means a happy life. Therefore, yes, other views of knowledge can also be valid: some ancient types of knowledge (as Buddhism) are by far excellent frames of reference to live happy lives. Occidental science is useful for tibetan monks, but their spiritual knowledge is the primary tool. Naturally, some parts of spiritual knowledge will contradict science. Otherwise Buddhism would be a part of science. When both types of knowledge contradict, spiritual knowledge would rule. 

Love implies receiving. Receiving generates a force from the subject (me) towards the object (my wife). This means the subject (me) receives contents from the object, as affection, sexual satisfaction, company, etc. Love implies giving. Giving generates a force from the object (my wife) towards the subject (me). This means the subject (me) gives contents to the object, as affection, sexual satisfaction, company, etc. Of course, contents are the same, but in the other direction. 

Science accepts its weaknesses and can change. Religious knowledge don't. Science is expressed on a formal language, tribal knowledge not. Science is objective, metaphysics don't. Under all points of view, scientific knowledge is the best option for survival and improving life and well-being. 

A teacher said once that we can understand any discipline as a conjunction of three elements: science, technique and art. Science is the theoretical knowledge (how are musical chords built or what is the best material to make shoes). Technique is the practical knowledge (moving the fingers to play chords, or being skillful to make a shoe). The last one, art is complex: it is related to transfer your feelings to others (playing a song that can make others dance or cry or making very comfortable shoes). Any discipline requires from all three. Some disciplines may be more artistic or scientific than others, but none is pure. Philosophy is not an exception. You need the theory (formalisms, knowledge, history), technique (using reason, logic, rhetoric to join theoretical elements) and art (being skillful to get an interesting/surprising/ironic/whatever point of view and communicating it). What I'm doing here is my way of getting to you in a way that I can impact you, give you an answer and make you think. You did the same with the phrase you saw before. I confess you impacted me, so you are on the right track, and yes: it is not easy. But here comes an important part of this lesson from my old teacher: Practice. I'm also a guitarist who spent years working on those three areas. Know a lot of musical theory. Spend at least one hour a day practicing the guitar. And of course, play for others, and listen their reactions. Therefore, it is practice on those three areas which will help you being able to approach any idea. 

Two elements are important: A) principles Values are relative to social groups. Principles are absolute to all people. Some social groups appreciate obesity (e.g. Peruvian natives understand it makes a woman strong, so she's valuable), others don't. Some social groups appreciate jewelry, others don't. Those are values, which depend on the social group. Principles, on the other side, are appreciated in all societies. Honesty, truth, loyalty, etc. are principles valuable in all societies. Your statement deals about principles, like honesty, kindness, service. B) Standing up for something implies embodying it. We learn more (I think it is >80%) from someone's acts than from his words. My mother used to say that she wasn't racist but I always saw her acting racist with certain kinds of people. In consequence, I noticed I followed her ways regarding racism. It is still difficult for me to embrace equality, but I am firmly committed to change that on me. Not only acting what we say is important for sending the message. When someone stands up for something but acts the opposite, it's being incoherent. Incoherence justifies anything, that's a mathematical fact (see the principle of explosion on Wikipedia). Religious books are examples of incoherence, which is natural since they were written by ordinary people, very ignorant, due to the context. If you base your actions on a religious book, you can justify mathematically (using logic) that killing your family or friends is good. Not joking. Holy wars are an example. Therefore, Standing up for some principle (like honesty) is easy. It is easy to criticize someone on the government. But embodying such principle is difficult. A lot of people criticize corruption, but become corrupt when reaching a political position involving monetary decisions. First, because their incoherence makes them believe they are acting fine. Second, because they are just repeating others' ways of acting, so they continue to teach such ways. That's the big fallacy denounced by your original statement. 

Making a shoe has the same equivalents: science, knowing the theory of leather; technique: using the hands to make a shoe; art, making a nice and useful shoe. Science is not only about academic knowledge. Technique is not only about industrial knowledge. Art is not only about paintings and music. For your question, science is just pure knowledge, art has a social impact. You are an artist if you make a beautiful shoe, even if you don't know its science. But knowing it helps it lasting longer and being more functional. 

Physically, the present does not exist. Just like a point occupies no area over a surface. A point is a named reference, occupies no space. The present is a mental entity, and it is based on our memory. On the brain, the present is a representation of some lapse of time, exactly as when we draw a point over a paper surface: it actually occupies an area. Sound is a good example: we listen something for a period of time and store a representation of it in our memory. Sound doesn't really exist without cutting time in slices. Present would be a value of the air pressure. Mathematically, present is our discretization of time. It is our brain that requires a second, a minute, a compass or a quarter (in music). Think of numbers without decimal points. That is the real nature. If you want to dig deeper, meditate this idea, that shows how subjective we are about nature: *nature has no decimal points; has no ten fingers to have a reference. * No references, sorry, part of the book I'm currently writing, about philosophy of physics. 

To prove something true, you need to 1) know truth, 2) to agree about it and 3) to verify it on a system. 

As my current work leaded me to analyse existence from the systemic point of view, I've decided it's time to read Sartre and about existentialism, which I've long time postponed. So I've started with Nausea and Existentialism is Humanism. Minutes after starting, I've found Sartre is brilliant, but for creating mental melodramas. I couldn't finish reading, despite the small truths and lovely phrases, I see a global fallacy, a rhetoric construction, the same stuff humorists do, but excluding humour. Hope being wrong and finding the vein that will help me understanding Sartre. What I don't get is Sartre builds the full exposition body based on implicit assumptions. What is the formal definition of existence, God, (human) essence, for Sartre, for existentialists? Can anyone give me some hints about this three concepts on existentialism? 

The systems theory is incomplete. I am one of many working on it. This is the proposal of my current writing: object systems exist for the subject systems they interact with. If a system is unable to interact with other, then it does not exist for the other. Therefore, existence is subjective. There is no such thing as absolute existence. If you can find where does a finger or a hurricane begin and end, that is the system... For you. Other people may disagree with you. Systems don't exist really in nature, there are only atoms interacting, and our brain create the limits. Think which atoms belong to the finger, or the sea. It is absolutely subjective. What is the FBI as a system? Does it include the building? The water on the building? The subject determines the system existence depending on the needs. If I need to geolocalize the FBI office, then it is a dot for me. Other example: does God exist? No, until you interact with him. Does the second moon of the earth exist? No until you are able to interact with it. Update: did Einstein existed? We didn't interacted personally with him: yes, because we can interact with his ideas, and because we know they were created by a name named Einstein, and we believe in certain people. Some people is mathematically convinced that there were no "attack" nor planes on 9/11, because some calculations and proof don't admit a plane. Those planes "objectively" don't exist for them. Objectivity can be just a compromise and a fuzzy agreement. Those planes exist for some and don't exist for others. About closed systems: ideal closed systems may exist (ex, the system black box without inputs and outputs), but physical closed systems don't have i/os by definition, therefore can't interact, therefore, don't exist. Interaction is a very interesting subject few people has taken care of, you can read my draft of a theory of general interaction on ydor.org. 

First, you need to understand what money is: Money is a certificate that tells that we, the society, owe something to you. If you have 100 bucks, it means you have provided a contribution to us that values 100 points, so we have created a central bank and emitted an amount of certificates equivalent to the sum of all social debts (that's the role of central banks). Then, we have created laws that force all people to accept that certificates in exchange for any contributions. Then, having this system, which guarantees a fair value of the certificates via the central bank and its validity via our laws, we give you a bill which values 100 bucks. Now, you can use that money to buy anything you like. For your information, bitcoin is not a coin, but moreover a digital jewel. We, the society, cannot tell what you use your 100 bucks on. You can buy beer or bitcoins that's up to you. But since bitcoin doesn't fill the requirements to be considered money, and since bitcoin is a jewel, the equivalent of a valuable email stored on your Hotmail account, it changes value depending on the society. Values change, that's an essential economic fact. So, if you pay 100 bucks for 100 bitcoins, and then, society thinks that bitcoin is not valuable because a hacker found a flaw on the code, and 100 bitcoins get a value of 1 buck, you cannot blame nobody (specially us, the society) for your bad choice. Bitcoin is not a risk per se. It allows speculation, which is like a lottery that pays the first ones. But most of the people buys such lottery and lose. If you want to speculate with economic assets, you must be very good and fast. On the other hand, the only ethical facet about the use of money does not regard money, but the owner. Bitcoin is as ethical as a rock. Some people pays big money for rocks or classical paintings. Van Gogh is not to be blamed for any unethical use of any of his paintings that worth millions. Is the contamination generated by bitcoin worse than the contamination generated by Stack Exchange? Should we shutdown both? We will not. We are just trying to survive using tools. The only value of bitcoin is just being the first digital asset, which is technically false: you can Google for the million dollar web page, a student who sold pixels at 1 dollar each, earning a million dollars. A bitcoin or a dot on the million dollars page are just subjective beliefs of worthy digital assets.
