The theorem shows the consistency of having a model of $ZFC$ (like $W_{\kappa}$) in which $GCH$ fails everywhere (in a finite gap form) but in its $HOD$, $GCH$ holds. In a remark after the theorem the author says: 

Update. A MathOverflow fellow just emailed me expressing his interest in conducting some statistical research on MathSciNet and MathOverflow databases. He asked whether I know how to get access to the corresponding background data, which I actually don't. I am not even sure if it is publicly accessible or free (particularly in the case of MathSciNet and Arxiv). I also suspect that there must be some non-disclosure rules and restrictions which any corresponding research along these lines should follow. It would be nice if somebody who knows how to get access to the raw material needed for any research concerning these databases, sheds some light on these issues. 

The above fact indicates that the occurrence of a Matryoshka phenomenon (i.e. having self-replicating structures) among certain types of mathematical structures may give rise to some large cardinals. In other words, a structure needs to be so large in order to be able to support a self-replicating Matryoshka-like structure. In this sense, JÃ³nsson cardinals have a characterization in terms of a Matryoshka phenomenon for certain type of mathematical structures, namely algebras. Here, the natural question to ask is whether there are other examples of a Matryoshka characterization for large cardinal axioms. In other words, what other Matryoshka phenomenona for mathematical structures do have some large cardinal strength? Precisely: 

Remark 2. Potentially, one may find some questions, related to the possible number/behavior of wild knots of the certain knot invariant (such as bridge, unknotting, stick numbers, etc.) in a forcing extension, interesting. However, for the sake of this question, I preferred to stick to a very specific one concerning crossing number. Please feel free to share your thoughts about other possibly interesting problems along these lines in the comments below. 

As some colleagues asked about the validity of the main result in the following paper in the absence of $\kappa$-cc property for fast function forcing, (with the permission of both authors) I would like to post an answer provided by Arthur in order to clarify the situation: A. Apter, J. Cummings, Blowing up the power set of the least measurable, Journal of Symbolic Logic 67 (2002), no. 3, 915--923. 

Update. According to Ian's remark in the comments section, it turned out that the notion of crossing number for wild knots retains some ambiguity, as (in contrary to the case for tame knots) there is no straightforward theorem guaranteeing the existence of a regular projection for wild knots, which is somehow essential for counting the number of crossing points in a wild knot. Roughly speaking, if you have a wild knot, you can't even be sure how much knotted it is! Another indication of why these crazy creatures deserve the name "wild"! Anyway, the soul of the original question remains valid even without any specification to the case of tame/wild knots of any particular characteristics in terms of knot invariants. The main problem is whether it is possible to add a morphologically new knot to the mathematical universe via forcing. Precisely: 

Remark. Following Joel's comment below, it is worth mentioning that the above definition is NOT the only variant of fast function forcing. There are other versions with slightly different properties. For a more complete argument along these lines see Joel's answer in this MO post. On one hand, preserving Shelah cardinals through lifting arguments often needs dominating the corresponding functions $f:\kappa\rightarrow \kappa$ by functions in the ground model. On the other hand, we know that the fast function forcing $\mathbb{P}_{\kappa}$ adds a very fast (and so non-dominatable) function of this type into the universe (i.e. the fast function) and simultaneously fails to satisfy $\kappa$-cc property which is a usual condition for providing dominating functions in the ground model. 

Here are some definitions and results from the above papers. You may find further information in the mentioned references: Definition. A polynomial $p(x_0, x_1,\cdots , x_{k-1})$ over the reals $\mathbb{R}$ is $(k, n)$-ary if each $x_i$ is an $n$-tuple of variables. We say that a $(k, n)$-ary polynomial $p(x_0, x_1,\cdots , x_{k-1})$ is avoidable if the points of $\mathbb{R}^n$ can be colored with countably many colors such that whenever $a_0, a_1,\cdots , a_{k-1}\in \mathbb{R}^n$ are distinct and $p(a_0, a_1,\cdots , a_{k-1})=0$, then there are $i < j < k$ such that the points $a_i, a_j$ are differently colored. The polynomial is unavoidable if it is not avoidable. Similarly, for an infinite cardinal $\kappa$, the $(k, n)$-ary polynomial $p(x_0, x_1,\cdots , x_{k-1})$ is $\kappa$-avoidable if the points of $\mathbb{R}^n$ can be colored using $\kappa$ colors such that whenever $a_0, a_1,\cdots , a_{k-1}\in \mathbb{R}^n$ are distinct and $p(a_0, a_1,\cdots , a_{k-1})=0$, then there are $i < j < k$ such that the points $a_i, a_j$ are differently colored. A polynomial is $\kappa$-unavoidable if it is not $\kappa$-avoidable. In fact, $p(x_0, x_1,\cdots , x_{k-1})$ is avoidable if the chromatic number $\chi (H)$ of its zero hypergraph $H$ is countable, and it is $\kappa$-avoidable if $\chi (H)\leq\kappa$. Example 1. For each $k<\omega$ and ordinal $\alpha$, the polynomial, $x_0+\cdots+x_{k}-x_{k+1}-kx_{k+2}$, in Fox' theorem is a $(k + 3, 1)$-ary polynomial which is $\aleph_{\alpha}$-avoidable if and only if $2^{\aleph_0}\leq \aleph_{\alpha+k}$. Example 2. The $(3, n)$-ary polynomial $p(x, y, z)=||x-y||^2-||y-z||^2$, for $2\leq n<\omega$ where $||.||$ denotes the Euclidean norm in $\mathbb{R}^n$, is avoidable. Theorem 1. For each $n < w$ there is a countable partition of $\mathbb{R}^n$ which avoids every avoidable $(-, n)$-ary polynomial over $\mathbb{Q}$. Theorem 2. Assuming $2^{\aleph_0}\geq \aleph_{m}$, every avoidable polynomial is $m$-avoidable. Theorem 3. Assuming $2^{\aleph_0}\leq \aleph_{m}$, every $m$-avoidable polynomial is avoidable. Corollary. The followings hold: (a) Assuming $2^{\aleph_0}\geq \aleph_{m}$, a polynomial is avoidable iff it is $m$-avoidable. (b) Assuming $2^{\aleph_0}\leq \aleph_{m}$, a polynomial is avoidable iff it is $\omega$-avoidable. 

Here is a partial answer. The answer to the main question is negative given the continuum hypothesis (or more generally the non-existence of a real valued measurable cardinal less than or equal to $\mathfrak c$). An extension $\mu$ of $P$ to all sets with property $H$ (even without any invariance properties) gives rise to an atomless probability measure $\nu$ on all subsets of $2^\omega$, the existence of which was shown to contradict the CH by Banach and Kuratowski. Here's how we get $\nu$. Given any subset $A$ of $2^\omega$, let $A^* = (\{ 0 \} \times A) \cup (\{ 1 \}\times (2^\omega\backslash A))$. This has property $H$. Thus, $\{ 0 \} \times A = A^* \cap (\{ 0 \} \times 2^\omega)$ is $\mu$-measurable, and so we can define $\nu(A) = 2\mu(A \cap (\{ 0 \} \times 2^\omega))$, which will be a probability measure on $\mathcal P {2^\omega}$, and it will be atomless because $P$ is. (This uses Alex Kruckman's simple construction of sets satisfying $H$.) Given ZFC alone, one can give a negative answer to one of my follow-ups. Specifically, there is no extension of the product measure to all sets with property $H$ that is invariant under permutations of $\omega$, even if we just ask for finite additivity in the extension. For if $\mu$ is a finitely additive extension of $P$ to all sets with $H$, then $\nu$ (defined as above) will be a finitely additive probability measure on $\mathcal P {2^\omega}$ invariant under permutations. A contradiction follows from the fact that $F_2$ is a subgroup of $S_\omega$. More precisely: Let $\langle Q_n \rangle_{n\in\omega}$ be a partition of $\omega$ into countably infinite subsets. Let $\phi_n$ be a bijection of $\omega$ with $Q_n$, and let $X$ be the subset of $2^\omega$ consisting of functions $f:\omega\to \{0,1\}$ such that $f\circ \phi_n \ne f\circ \phi_m$ if $n\ne m$. Then $P(X)=1$ (the probability of a repeat in a countable sequence of uniform i.i.d. random variables is zero). Now for any permutation $\pi$ of $\omega$, let $\pi^*$ be the permutation such that $\pi^*(\phi_n(m))=\pi^*(\phi_{\pi(n)}(m))$ for all $n$ and $m$. Note that $\pi^*[X]=X$. The permutations of the form $\pi^*$ form a subgroup $G$ of $S_\omega$ isomorphic to the full group, and $G$ has no non-trivial fixed points on $X$. Since $S_\omega$ contains a free group of rank 2, there is no finitely additive $G$-invariant probability measure on $X$ (here we use AC), which contradicts the fact that $\nu$ is such a measure. I still don't know: Can one prove a negative answer to the main question in ZFC alone? Can one prove a negative answer to the main question with $\rho_n$-invariance in ZFC alone? 

Stipulate that the Axiom of Probabilistic Choice (APC) says that for every collection $\{ A_i : i \in I \}$ of non-empty sets, there is a function on $I$ that assigns to $i$ a finitely-additive probability measure $\mu_i$ on $A_i$. Then Hahn-Banach (HB) implies APC, since HB is equivalent to the existence of a finitely-additive probability measure on every boolean algebra, and hence implies the existence of such a measure on the direct sum of the powerset algebras $P(A_i)$. APC is non-trivial in that it implies the Banach-Tarski paradox and the existence of nonmeasurable sets (the proof Foreman and Wehrung use to show that HB implies Banach-Tarski works). Question: Does APC imply HB? (When I think about this, I find I keep on wanting to use Stone representation, but of course to do that would be to assume Boolean Prime Ideal, which is stronger than HB or APC.) 

I couldn't find anything in the literature either, but the answer to the first question is positive. Let $G$ be a group acting on a space $X$. Say that $G$'s action on $X$ has the invariant order-extension property provided that every $G$-invariant partial order on $X$ (i.e., partial order $\le$ such that $x\le y$ iff $gx\le gy$, for each $g\in G$) extends to a $G$-invariant linear order on $X$. I managed to show: Theorem. The following are equivalent for an abelian group $G$: 

If one replaces $2^\Omega$ in FCU with an arbitrary boolean algebra, then FCU becomes equivalent to BPI, and FCP comes to imply HB. 

I couldn't find anything in the literature on total right preorderability (but perhaps I didn't know the terminology to look under). Obvious facts about total right-preorderability: 

A more specific question then is whether the first or the third fact has a true converse? (The second doesn't, since there are right-orderable groups that have a non-indicable subgroup.) Or at least a converse given some nice assumptions? A related question: Are there non-trivial sufficient conditions for having a right-orderable quotient? 

Given a field $F$ of subsets of $\Omega$, we can define full conditional probabilities to be a function $P:F\times (F-\{ \varnothing \}) \to [0,1]$ such that: 

Question: Can every probability space $(X,\scr F,\mu)$ be $\sigma$-embedded in the completion of the space $[0,1]^K$ (equipped with a product of Lebesgue measure) for some set $K$? Here, $f:\scr F\to \scr G$ is a $\sigma$-embedding of the measure space $(X,\scr F,\mu)$ into $(Y,\scr G,\nu)$ iff $f$ is one-to-one, and preserves measure, complements and countable unions. Here's what I have so far: Maharam's Theorem implies the measure (or probability) algebra of $X$ is $\sigma$-isomorphic to the measure (or probability) algebra of a disjoint union of countably many copies of $[0,1]^{K_n}$ (if $X$ has atoms, some of the $K_n$ will be empty), and of course the disjoint union $\sigma$-embeds in the measure algebra of $[0,1]^K$ for large enough $K$. Combining this with a lifting, we get a map from $\scr F$ to ${\scr L}^K$, the measurable sets of the completion of $[0,1]^K$, that preserves measure, complements and finite unions and is almost one-to-one (i.e., $f(A)=f(B)$ implies $\mu(A\Delta B)=0$). We can make the embedding be one-to-one by ensuring $K$ is large enough that there is a null subset $N$ of $[0,1]^K$ of the same cardinality as $X$ and replacing our almost one-to-one map $f:{\scr F}\to{\scr L}^K$ with $g(A)=(f(A)\backslash N)\cup h[A]$, where $h$ is a bijection between $X$ and $N$. Then $g$ will be an embedding into the completion of $[0,1]^K$. But I want a $\sigma$-embedding.
