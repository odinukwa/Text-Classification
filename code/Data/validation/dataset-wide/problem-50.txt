I know your next thought is to intercept and modify MRO's telemetry. Unfortunately all of the DSN antennas used to communicate with the orbiter are under physical control of the US government, and two of them are not in ESA member states. In order to alter MRO's data, the EU would have to mount one of the most sophisticated cyberattacks ever conceived against the world's most paranoid nation (who is also one of the two world superpowers in cybersecurity), and remain undetected for years under heavy and immediate scrutiny from the engineers who designed and built the instruments and the scientists who have been analyzing data from them for a decade. In short, impossible. 

Both. In fact, the density would increase to around ten billion kilograms per cubic meter as the mass increases to around 10 solar masses (but no more than a couple hundred, at which point the star is so bright the photon pressure blows it apart). 

First off I'll note that in the future we may have a way to determine position anywhere in the solar system or throughout the galaxy without assistance using pulsars like stellar GPS satellites. (I know some of the people who worked on this idea and they say it's plausible with today's technology, they just don't have the funding yet.) For traveling to other stars, you could therefore give heliocentric XYZ coordinates and velocities (since stars are not affected by gravity too much over timescales of human interest). Now one thing that makes the celestial navigation problem vastly easier is that (unlike points on the Earth's surface) there is not a continuous array of stars and planets: there exist only a finite number in discrete locations. Think of addresses: we don't give the GPS coordinates of a house, we give the city, street name, and street number. In order to identify Earth, for example, we would only have to identify the Sun (and we don't have to be too precise, since the nearest star is light-years away) and then we can label Earth as the third planet. Anybody who can observe the solar system will be able to see and identify the location of Earth. Finally, I'll leave you with the JPL HORIZONS website. Set Ephemeris Type to ELEMENTS and click Generate, and it will give you the orbital elements of the target body (default is Mars). Six orbital elements are enough to completely specify the orbit of a body. They change slowly over time, but if you just want to identify a planet they're close enough. If you want to precisely predict it's position, then you probably only need to additionally store the rate of change of the parameters. 

In the through-the-Earth case, the speed reaches $\sqrt{gR}$, $7.9~\text{km}/\text{s}$. This happens to be the same as orbital speed, meaning that a surface-skimming satellite makes it to the other side at the same time as a straight-line gravity train. In the case of a New York to Los Angeles trip ($d=3914~\text{km}$): 

The second point you ask about is the effect on the Sun. The Sun already looses a billion kilograms per second to the solar wind. Even the large rate is only a tenth of that (and the 'reasonable' rate is one ten-thousandth), so it's not likely to have a significant effect. 

This is the crux of my question: how can I modify the rules to allow a second character with the rewind power? Here are my requirements: 

This would actually work as you describe (assuming all your material/technology requirements are met, as you do). However, there is a practical issue. Unless you have some super-high-density energy storage medium, you will probably be beaming your energy back as a maser or laser (also as you describe). Let's stop and think for a second. Where is the energy to support that atmospheric temperature gradient coming from? The Sun of course! The Sun heats the planet/atmosphere, and the heat is trapped by the greenhouse effect. This effectively makes your power-generation scheme a roundabout solar generator. If you have the technology to efficiently convert your energy beam into usable power, then you also have the technology to efficiently convert raw sunlight into power. Solar panels will be much more efficient at generating power: the theoretical limits are somewhere around 50%, while the thermal efficiency limits on a thermal engine with a hot-side temperature of only 100 C (assuming a cold-side temperature near 0 C) is much lower, around 25% (even discounting the mechanical and secondary conversion losses). 

Full atmosphere. Objects on the order of 100 km away would look similar. However, as objects recede further into the distance, they would become fainter and fainter, and start moving upward, probably becoming invisible once they were a few degrees above the horizon horizontal. Straight overhead, we would always see a white sky, brighter towards the zenith (straight up). The atmosphere would be too thick to see the sun through, so we would be seeing scattered sunlight. If the sun somehow became dark at 'night,' the sky would be uniformly bright from the airglow of nearby artificial lights, or perhaps the reflected and scattered sunlight from the other side. Thin atmosphere. As before, objects grow fainter as they recede into the distance. However, less than a degree above horizontal, the view starts to become clearer again as your line of sight passes through less and less atmosphere. A few degrees above horizontal, the view is almost undistorted again, and you can see the bowl of the Earth rising up, curving overhead. You would be able to see the other side of the Earth high in the sky, albeit with some amount of desaturation due to the scattered light of the normal blue sky being added to the view (but not twice; since you're not in the atmosphere on the other side, you don't see it's scattered light). If the Sun goes totally dark at night, you would see everything dim uniformly, but not redden since the sun is not setting. If the Sun only shines on half the Earth at a time, then you'd be left with a bright-as-day night sky, with a soft, diffuse illumination equivalent to indoor lighting. The day would look more normal, with the overhead sky being totally blue at noon. At sunon and sunoff you would see half the sky illuminated by earthglow, and you would be able to watch the terminator move across the sky. 

I'll make the crucial assumption that the magi's telekinesis is also limited 50 kph (although I'll allow that it can accelerate objects up to that speed instantly). If the display case/security system extends 1 m around the staff, this gives us a minimum of 72 ms to destroy the staff1 once the security system detects it has been moved. The obvious solution is a shaped charge: when deployed, it emits a jet or slug of molten metal at several kilometers per second, sufficient to destroy pretty much anything. A couple shaped charges in the base and top of the display case will be enough to completely obliterate the staff once the system has been triggered. They are also incredibly fast: see this video of a Russian APS destroying an RPG2 in-flight with a shaped charge. Of course, the great thing about shaped charges is that they're directed. The amount of explosive is also relatively low: since their energy is focused they don't need to be as strong. This means that (with proper shielding) no damage will result to the rest of the building, and most of the people in the room will survive (albeit with permanent hearing damage). Note that a shaped charge will punch through most materials as if they were not there, so the system could be neatly concealed by the wood paneling of the display case. 

I'll continue, assuming a $225~M_\odot$ star with a luminosity of $3\,200\,000~L_\odot$. (Based off the luminosity of this star, the most massive known currently). The radiation budget of a planet does not depend on its size, since the amount of solar energy received and amount of thermal energy radiated are both proportional to surface area. However, the surface temperature will depend on the atmosphere's thickness and composition, especially the presence of greenhouse gasses. I will assume an atmosphere similar to Earth's in thickness. (Note however that, due to the increased gravity, the density and pressure of the atmosphere will necessarily be increased, but it will not reach as far into space.) Making the above assumptions, we therefore want to place our planet so that the solar constant (incoming solar energy per unit area) is the same as for Earth. Due to the inverse-square law, this disance will scale exactly with the square root of luminosity. The distance is therefore $\sqrt{5\,000\,000}\approx 2200$ times Earth's orbital radius, or $2200~\text{AU}$. Serban noted that there would be increased stellar wind. Indeed, R136a1 is estimated to be losing mass at a rate of $50~M_\odot/\text{My}$. This only amounts to about $300~\text{kg}/\text{s}$ of wind impacting your (Earth-size) planet, almost 1000 times the wind at Earth. I would suggest giving your super-dense planet a super-strong magnetic field to protect itself (this also nets you super-intense [magical?] aurorae). Now from Kepler's laws we know that the period of an orbit is: $$ T = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{a^3}\mu} $$ We can again simply compare to the Earth-Sun system by ratios. $\mu$ is 225 times greater, and $a$ is 2200 times greater. Therefore the period is about $\sqrt{2200^3/225}\approx 7000$ times greater: in other words, this planet would have a year as long as agriculture is old on Earth. Assuming a 30 hour day, that's about two million days per year. A planet's moons are inside its Hill sphere, or sphere of gravitational influence (an exception is our own moon, which is incredibly huge compared to other planets' moons). The size of the Hill sphere is: $$ r\approx a\left(\frac{m}{3M}\right)^\frac 1 3 $$ For your planet, the distance would be about 0.01 times the orbital radius $a$. But remember that $a=1000~\text{AU}$: that gives the Hill sphere a radius of $22~\text{AU}$, twice the size of Saturn's orbit. So you can probably pack in as many moons as you want. Note however that the moons are likely to be small, like Saturn and Jupiter's moons, which are thousands of times smaller than their parent planet. A large moon would sweep up all the smaller bodies as they formed, resulting in an Earth-Moon-like system. 

We just have $p=mv$ and $T=\frac 12mv^2$. Just by dividing those equations we get: $$ v=\frac{2T}{p}= 2.3\times 10^8~\text{m}/\text{s}=0.76~c\\ m=\frac{p^2}{2T}= 8.7\times 10^{24}~\text{kg}=1.45~\text{M}_\text{Earth} $$ Ok, I see really high speeds which means we need to take relativity into account. Fiddling with the proper equations gives us: $$ v= \left(\frac{p}{2T}+\frac{T}{2pc^2}\right)^{-1} = 2.0\times 10^8~\text{m}/\text{s}=0.67~c\\ m= \frac{p^2}{2T}-\frac{T}{2c^2}= 7.4\times 10^{24}~\text{kg}=1.24~\text{M}_\text{Earth} $$ For a more reasonable Sun's speed of $100~\text{km}/\text{s}$ the minimum mass goes up to: $$ v= \left(\frac{p}{2T}+\frac{T}{2pc^2}\right)^{-1} = 2.3\times 10^6~\text{m}/\text{s}=0.76\%~c\\ m= \frac{p^2}{2T}-\frac{T}{2c^2}= 8.7\times 10^{28}~\text{kg}=4.4\%~\text{M}_\text{Sun} $$ (Remember, this represents an absolute minimum mass required. You'll have to go with something heavier (and therefore slower) to avoid punching right through the Sun.) So you're not looking at an asteroid, but more like shooting a dwarf star into the sun at a speed of $2000~\text{km}/\text{s}$. Good luck with that! 

Spatial Disorientation Remember that the air is the dragon's natural environment, so dragons will probably be much harder to disorient. Disorientation is the result of environmental cues (rotation rates and accelerations) in a maneuvering aircraft that differ greatly from what humans experience on the ground. Our brains never evolved to handle rotation in multiple axes, and fail to correctly figure out what's going on. A dragon (or any flying animal) has a brain evolved to process flying, and so will be as resistant to disorientation as a human walking along the ground. Instruments Dragons will probably have a different definition of IFR flight than fixed-wing aircraft. Since they fly slower and are vastly more maneuverable (due to highly variable wing geometry), the risk of collision is reduced even in low-visibility conditions. Flying through thick clouds or heavy rain will still carry the risk of collision, but I doubt dragons would do much flying through thunderstorms; after all, they aren't protected from the elements by a plane! Also note that dragons already have all the senses they need to fly: unlike humans, who can't feel airspeed, for example. A dragon probably wouldn't need instruments to supplement their senses, only for navigation. After all, people use GPS even when they're walking! A dragon-flight GPS would be more like an aircraft's flight computer, calculating more efficient paths to take advantage of high-altitude winds. Flight Plans You don't file a walking plan to head down to the grocery store: dragons probably wouldn't need one either. The reason aircraft are required to file a flight plan is due to the collision risk (already discussed above) and the fact there are relatively few flights, and most flights cover a long distance. Assuming that there would be hundreds of millions of flight plans filed per day, most of which cover distances of a few miles or less, the FAA would probably not regulate them merely due to the inconvenience.
