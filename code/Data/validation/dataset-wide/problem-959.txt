Yes, there are a lot of waves in wind. The wave you may be looking for is called a gravity wave (aka buoyancy wave). To name a few other waves Rossby Waves, Gravity Waves, Inertio-Gravity waves, Sound Waves, Kelvin Waves I am sure there are more than just those few waves out there. 

Annually, about 51 people die from lightning strikes per year in the United States. Part of the reason is the low probability of being hit by lightning. Tornadoes, hail, and straight line winds sweep large areas, while one lightning bolt covers a rather small area, and may even be harmless if it doesn't make contact. Think of it this way: if you were struck by lightning, a person 500 feet away may not be harmed by it, but if straight line winds cause your house to collapse, you can say with relative certainty that your neighbor will have some damage. Another factor is the reliability of protection. Major hail can total a car. Strong straight line winds and tornadoes can collapse or remove your house. A lightning bolt will cause property damage, but you will be safe inside, provided you aren't touching metal. 

According to Monin-Obukhov similarity theory, Reynolds-averaged surface layer winds can be expressed by $$\frac{\partial \bar{U}}{\partial z}=\frac{u_*\psi_M(\frac{z}{L})}{kz}$$ The potential temperature can be expressed as$$\frac{\partial \bar{\theta}}{\partial z}=\frac{\theta_*\psi_H(\frac{z}{L})}{kz}$$ and I found one for moisture $$\frac{\partial \bar{q}}{\partial z}=\frac{q_*\psi_q(\frac{z}{L})}{kz}$$My question is whether this could be generalized to a tracer $\chi$ such that $$\frac{\partial \bar{\chi}}{\partial z}=\frac{\chi_*\psi_\chi(\frac{z}{L})}{kz}$$ If so, would this question the validity of the Gaussian Plume model? Note: $u_*, \theta_*, q_*$ and $\chi_*$ are the scaled quantities. $\psi_M, \psi_H, \psi_q,$ and $\psi_\chi$ are the universal functions for each quantity. $k$ is the Von Karman constant. 

The problem with a statistical model is the reliance on dynamical model input, plus the requirement of climatology. A statistical model will also only give data for a solitary point, not an area. The simplest statistical model is persistence, which is the current weather, followed by climatology. Both are the lowest in forecast skill. For a dynamic model, try using the WRF model ($URL$ It is a commonly used model. The runtime will range, depending on your computational power and needs. A larger domain will take longer, and require more. I know people who simulate hurricanes with it, and people who run fine scale modeling. I can run WRF with a 200 km domain size for a 36 hour forecast in 1-2 hours. Again it will really depend on your resources. Running WRF may require compilers you do not have access to. You can develop the visualization software after you ran the model, with whatever tools you find. Python and NCL are good languages, but MATLAB and a variety of other languages can be used. 

Yes, there are ways of regenerating atmospheric ozone. Generally, you need an oxygen atom and an oxygen molecule to react to form ozone (as well as something to take off excess energy). The generation of the oxygen atom has a couple pathways, but near the surface, it is mostly generated from the photolysis of nitrogen dioxide. 

Not exactly. The PBL is a quantity more or less derived. you may be able to derive it from upper air observations, but a direct observation of it is not yet available. Here are some methods: $URL$ The question you are asking is the equivalent of "Can we observe the Jet stream?" We cannot observe the jet stream, but we can observe the winds, from which we infer the jet stream. 

Various processes affect the freezing point. Both CCN (cloud condensation nuclei) characteristics and drop size affect the freezing point. 

Try this website. You can pick out what todays highs and lows are and compare them to the climatological values. $URL$ Also, state climatologists are good sources of information. 

Presume that the atmosphere can be modeled with waves of different frequencies. Therefore, the atmosphere can be written as a series of sine and cosine functions with different frequencies and coefficients. Consider the linear advection equation: $$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}= -c \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}$$ Consider the assumption that $u$ can be modeled as $$u=\sum^\infty_{|n|=0} A_n(t)\exp(i\omega_n x) $$ But since we have limited computational resources, $$u=\sum^N_{|n|=0} A_n(t)\exp(i\omega_n x) $$ Therefore, our advection equation becomes $$\sum^\infty_{|n|=0} \frac{d A_n(t)}{dt}\exp(i\omega_n x)=-c\sum^\infty_{|n|=0} i \omega_n A_n(t)\exp(i\omega_n x) $$ If we integrate this equation and leverage the orthogonal properties of sine and cosine, $$\int^L_0 \sum^\infty_{|n|=0} \frac{d A_n(t)}{dt}\exp(i\omega_n x)\exp(i\omega_m x)dx=-c\int^L_0 \sum^\infty_{|n|=0} i \omega_n A_n(t)\exp(i\omega_n x)\exp(i\omega_m x)dx$$ Then the summation notation can be removed. $$\frac{d A_m(t)}{dt}=-ic \omega_m A_m(t)$$ Now this can be solved analytically, and as such we do have an analytic solution to the advection equation, but what we can do to model this numerically, is combine the finite difference notation and the spectral solution to numerically integrate the advection equation. For example, $$u_{n+1}= u_n -c\Delta t\sum^\infty_{|l|=0} i \omega_l A_l(t)\exp(i\omega_l x) $$ So to summarize, 

High pressure areas, however, have a different formation process, one the involves converging winds and cooling. In brief: low pressure systems have fronts because (generally) the creation of low pressure systems require differences in temperature. High pressure areas do not- they need different "ingredients." 

To form a cloud, generally speaking, pressure does not play a significant factor (with the exception of the effect on temperature). If you want to prove that to yourself, go outside when it is foggy and measure the air pressure. Fog is a cloud, and pressure likely hasn't changed as much as it does in the vertical direction. As far a forming a cloud, it is actually relatively easy. You only need to decrease the temperature to it's dewpoint. You may want relatively dirty air, so that the solute effect makes it easy to form drops. Silver iodide would be good for this. For reference, the Kohler curve describes the saturation needed for cloud droplets to form. 

As air moves over the surface of the earth, the properties of the surface (such as temperature) can alter the air. Since at those particular latitudes, the predominant wind direction is from the west and partially the north, it is important to note what is north and west of both locations. West of the northeast Atlantic is land, and northwest is Canada. This means that the air is drier, and prone to have characteristics of mimicking continental- polar (cP) air. Continental polar air tends to be dry (since it is over land) and cold (since it is coming from an area that receives less sunlight). West of the northwest pacific is the Pacific Ocean, and northwest is still the Pacific Ocean. This means that the air is more moist and prone to have characteristics mimicking the air over the ocean, called Maritime polar (mP). Since the water tends to warm slower than the land and also slower than the land, the air over the water is usually warmer during the winter and cooler over the summer than the air over the land. To summarize: 

What chemical in smog generally obscures visibility (discounting aerosols)? Is there a relationship between the concentrations of the chemical and the optical depth/visibility of the smog? 

Unfortunately, I don't think such a numerical model exists that would be suitable for high school students' understanding. The simplest climate model around is a zero-dimensional (energy balance) climate model, but a background on mathematics, and programming may be necessary. You can find one here. Wikipedia has one listed. Michael Mann has the source code for such a model, but it is written in MATLAB (you may be able to run it in OCTAVE, since MATLAB is licensed). There are likely many more than just these, considering multiple layers, volcanic eruptions, etc. The code for the models listed are simplified models that do not consider things like clouds, aerosols, eddy diffusion, etc. This is where Global Climate Models (GCMs) differ. They must consider how fine details, some of which aren't considered by weather models, affect the climate. Therefore, they are usually complicated. Most GCMs I have seen are written in FORTRAN, which is an antiquated language, but computationally efficient. This makes even easy concepts obtuse. While I have not dealt specifically with CESM, I can infer some things about it. By definition, CESM is an earth systems model, not an exoplanet model. You may be able to adapt some of the parameters to other planets, but it becomes too difficult for just one person to do (because of FORTRAN). There are models for other places, such as GCMs for Mars, but they are difficult to run and not necessarily accurate. Clusters are needed due to memory limitations, and how long they run for. 

Snow, unlike rain, has holes as well as different refractive properties. This allows the radar beam to penetrate and reflect the beam differently than an ordinarily oblate rain drop. 

Farrenthope is correct, but I would like to add some detail. An inversion occurs when the air is warmer than the ground. It is called an inversion because it is the opposite of what occurs during the day. During the day, the ground is heated by the sun and the air near the ground rises. However, during clear and calm nights, the ground will cool faster than the air. This means that at a certain time, the air will be warmer than the ground. With nothing to move pollutants upward, the air just stagnates. People will still keep pumping pollutants out, with the pollution just accumulating. During the day, however, the pollutants are lifted upwards, and do not stagnate. For those mathematically affluent, the equation for a concentration of a pollutant can be written as $$\frac{\partial c}{\partial t}=-\vec{v}\cdot\nabla_h c-w\frac{\partial c}{\partial z}+\nabla \cdot (K\nabla c) +S_c(t)+C$$ where $c$ is the concentration of the pollutant, $\vec{v}$ is the wind vector, $w$ is the vertical velocity, $K$ is the Fick's law constant, and $C$ is the chemistry term. If we consider the following assumptions which are common, regardless of an inversion: 

The formula for moisture flux is $$q\vec{V} $$ where $q$ is the water vapor mixing ratio, which can be found using mixhum_ptr and $\vec{V}$ is the velocity. Therefore the divergence of the moisture flux must be $$\nabla{\dot{}q\vec{V}}=\frac{\partial(qu)}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial(qv)}{\partial y}+\frac{\partial(qw)}{\partial z} $$ $$\approx\frac{\delta(qu)}{\delta x}+\frac{\delta(qv)}{\delta y}+\frac{\delta(qw)}{\delta z}$$ which is computable if you have gridded data. For example, you could compute this by setting $$qu=q\ast u$$ $$qv=q\ast v$$ $$qfluxDiv=uv2dv\_cfd(qu,qv,lat,lon,opt) $$ Use uv2dv_cfd per $URL$ Note: If you wanted the turbulent moisture flux, you would need to subtract $\nabla{\dot{}\bar{\vec{V}}\bar{q}}$ from your answer. 

Are there? Sure. For example, any water molecule that undergoes a chemical transformation. For example, the chemical equation $$\ce{CO_{2(aq)} + H_2O <--> HCO_{3}^-_{(aq)} + H^-_{(aq)}}$$ destroys the water molecule to create ions. Now since it is a reversible reaction, it is arguable whether or not the molecule is actually destroyed. However, once the reaction $$\ce{Ca^{2+}_{(aq)} + 2HCO_{3}^-_{(aq)} <--> CaCO_3 + CO_{2(aq)} +H_2O}$$ occurs, than the original molecule is arguably destroyed. An underlying assumption: I am considering a water molecule to never have been evaporated if it at some point is destroyed (i.e. the atoms no longer make up water). 

Since burning coal leads to a variety of air pollutants, presumably a coal mine fire would also lead to air pollutants. My question is whether there have been any published studies on the emission rate of SO$_2$ from a mine fire, such as the Centralia fire in Pennsylvania? 

Since ozone is a greenhouse gas, I would say it would enhance warming. This article explains how regional climate may be impacted by ozone This article says that while global ozone should decrease as a result of warming, ozone over populated areas should increase. Water vapor plays a minute role in the production of tropospheric ozone- it increases the amount of hydroxyl radical to be used in hydroperoxyl formation. 

The easiest answer is that Safe Haven is a movie, and the writer made a factual error (which is not uncommon). I have not watched that movie, so I am unsure what type of situation they were dealing with. Doppler radars do not predict, but they observe. What is possible, however, is extrapolation and the creation of inferences. For example, tornadoes are not directly predicted by Doppler Radar, but by making inferences from the data, a meteorologist may detect a tornado. In a similar sense, if the radar-derived 'storm total precipitation' has estimated an average 0.25 inches of rain from a squall line for the past 200 miles, one may extrapolate, or estimate, that the squall line will produce ~0.25 inches of rain. Could the squall line alter its path or intensity and drastically change the amount? Sure, but without additional information, including information not derived from a radar, that would be a difficult task. Edit: Ok, I think I have a better idea of what the question was and how it can be answered. Doppler radar can measure wind speed relative to the radar site. So if can sense how fast a storm is approaching. Assuming the storm does not change it's speed, and given it's history, you can infer when it will arrive at the radar site. For example, if a storm is 50 miles away, and it moves at 25 miles per hour it will arrive in $50\text{ mi}\div 25\frac{\text{mi}}{\text{hr}}=2\text{ hr}$, provided the storm does not change. 

The maximum potential intensity (MPI) is a computed quantity that often sets a maximum bound for maximum hurricane wind speed, though rarely, the wind speeds observed can exceed it. MPI is based off of the idea that hurricanes effectively work as Carnot engines. Has there been a table produced with historic MPI calculations (reanalysis or forecast based)? Also, is there a source that calculates MPI for each model and each hurricane? For reference, $$v_{MPI}=\sqrt{\frac{C_k(T_s-T_0)}{C_dT_0}\Delta k}=\sqrt{\frac{T_sC_k}{T_0C_d}(CAPE_s-CAPE_b)}$$ where $v_{MPI}$ is the theoretical maximum speed (MPI), $C_k$ is the surface drag coefficient of enthalpy, $C_D$ is the surface drag coefficient, $\Delta k$ is the change in enthalpy between the surface and environment, $T_s$ is the sea surface temperature, $T_0$ is the outflow temperature, $CAPE_s$ is the convective available potential energy (CAPE) from sea level and $CAPE_b$ is the CAPE of the boundary layer air.
