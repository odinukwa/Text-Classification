It is interesting how these early hagiographies have been completely forgotten. Even Wikipedia repeats the confused muddle posed in this question about "snakes possibly meaning pagans". St. Patrick's tussles with druids are well-documented in sources dating to soon after his lifetime.

As mentioned in the comments, the original source of this claim is K. S. Lal, Growth of Muslim Population in Medieval India (Delhi: Research Publications in Social Sciences, 1973). He claims a population of 200 million in AD 1000, based on an analysis of Jatindra Mohamed Datta's article "Proportion of Muhammadans in India Through Centuries" (Modern Review, Calcutta, January 1948). Datta cites Firishta, a 17th century historian who supposedly gave the population for 1000 as 600 million, but Lal was unable to find this number in Firishta's text himself. Datta also uses W. H. Moreland's India at the Death of Akbar (London: Macmillan, 1920) as an outside estimate of something over 100 million. However, as one might guess, Datta chose the figure of 200 million not from a strict mathematical balance between Firishta and Moreland, but to represent a thesis he already believed: 

On the other hand, one source denies any correlation between the Tunisian food price index and the start of protests, and points out that a public announcement that food prices would be lowered did not stop the protests. (source) Furthermore, in other countries like Morocco, Jordan, and Algeria, people spend 40% of their budget on food, compared to 6% in America, but despite protests and riots those governments were not overthrown. (source) From this we can gather that the Arab Spring was different from the 2007-8 food riots in its political motivations and desire for regime change, as well as the weakness of the governments being protested against. Food prices may have been a "spur" but people's motivations were more multifaceted than that, as evidenced by the state of the Arab world today. 

The sources quoted in the question suggest that there are 100,000 civilians total in East Aleppo. By this is apparently meant the entire area that was held by rebels between 2013 and 2016. By 13 December, 98% of the city had been retaken by the Assad regime. On that day the Russian Center for Syrian Reconciliation, which is on the ground in Aleppo, said that roughly 110,000 civilians were safe in regime-controlled districts. The Center itself had counted and confirmed 95,000 civilians in East Aleppo and was providing them with medical attention and care, according to Vanessa Beeley, a freelance pro-regime journalist; the remaining 15,000 was an estimate of those not yet spotted by authorities. The official count rose a few days later to 108,000. Also on 13 December, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a freelance pro-rebel journalist group run by a Britain-based blogger which is generally recognized as a reliable source, concluded that 442 civilians were killed by pro-regime forces during the retaking of Aleppo, as well as 130 civilians killed by pro-rebel forces. It has not reported any deaths in East Aleppo since then. On 14 December, Zouhir Alshimale, a freelance pro-rebel journalist reporting from within the 2% of the city still held by rebels, estimated that 60,000 civilians remained in his area. Reports made from within the rebel-held territory have been called into question by some media. In contrast, the professional Kuwaiti journalist Elijah Magnier -- who has been covering the war for several years and has high-level connections -- estimated that only 10,000 civilians remained. On 16 December, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights noted that shelling had stopped over the period 15-16 December. On that day, a Turkish-Russian agreement to evacuate both citizens and rebel militants was upheld, and thousands of militants were observed leaving Aleppo with their families. On 17 December, Arab League Envoy to Syria -- that is to say, anti-regime source -- Staffan de Mistura estimated that 40,000 civilians remained in the 2% rebel-held pockets of the city. A day later, Reuters, relying on Syrian state television, quoted an estimate of 15,000 people (presumably including militants). As of the evening of December 18, the evacuation has been temporarily halted because rebels are shelling the evacuation buses and threatening to murder those who ride them. With the exception of the Russian and SOHR figures, all the other numbers here are estimates. 

The paywalled article that referenced this essay could find no scientific source for claims of two hundred and XX years of peace, and even the French source cited in this essay does not explain his methodology. 

The Korean War was not a very popular war, as America wanted to return to peacetime society after WW2. The soldiers did not know America's justification for war, and they knew very little about the Chinese. Some had never finished school, were first-generation immigrants, or were unfamiliar with the concept of ideology. They were led blindly into an unwanted war, and the Chinese argued that communism was the way to peace. From 1951 to 1953, POWs were kept in starvation level conditions against the Geneva Convention. In 1953, the camps were handed over to the Chinese, and the POWs were quite surprised to be referred to as "students" rather than "prisoners" and treated with dignity. Those who defected had generally expected to die and found life under the Chinese surprisingly tolerable. Because Army regulations were not yet clear on the extent of cooperation with the enemy that was permissible, the POWs were uncertain where to draw the line. The Code of Conduct was later drawn up because of this. Chinese "educators" spoke to the POWs reasonably. Most were unconvinced regardless, but a few started to become interested in what they were saying, for example Clarence Adams: 

Kind of, kind of not. This is apparently a highly cited article on the subject: 'The "Venus" figurines', Current Anthropology 41.4 (2000) 

The White House acknowledged that the tweets were made, calling them "pocket tweets." As for their content, WaPo speculates that they're two-factor authentication codes which he sent back to the SMS number that Twitter uses, rather than entering into the device he was using to log in. 

Does this figure include Muslims? Basically, no. In fact it is very hard to measure Muslims by the survey criteria. Jaak Billiet and Bart Meuleman explain in their 2008 study "Religious diversity in Europe and its relation to social attitudes and value orientations": 

According to the links offered at the CitizenGo petition, this claim is being made by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán. 

The 1907 Imperial Conference was a decidedly pro-local autonomy conference, at which the British colonies were deemed Dominions. The 1911 book The Imperial Conference; a history and study says:

The comments on this question have correctly pointed out that it is possibly unanswerable because of the variety of meanings attributed to the word "Judaism." The question, as well as the encyclopedia sources it cites, seems to equate Judaism with the monotheistic worship of the Jewish people. When the Jews became monotheistic believers in "Judaism" is up for debate, even if you believe in the literal truth of the Bible. (Remember the golden calf?) The ancient Jews seem to have worshiped several different gods. They were certainly united in a kingdom at several points, and still considered themselves a nation even after their kingdom was captured by the Babylonians, the Persians, and the Romans; however, the meaning of "nation" differed strongly between Jewish communities, as we learn from non-Biblical sources. Eventually all gods were excluded other than Yahweh, who received the sacrifices at the Second Temple. (source: review article) The history of the Jewish people spans thousands of years, going back to Bible narratives like Exodus that take place centuries before what archaeology can confirm, and the quasi-theological question of when "real" monotheism began can't be answered scientifically. But to most people, in common parlance, Judaism means Rabbinic Judaism, which arose after the destruction of the Second Temple. Even scholars agree that this is the best way to define the term. Philip R. Davies, in his article "Beyond 'Biblical Archaeology'" (in Hjelm and Thompson, eds., Biblical Interpretation Beyond Historicity: Changing Perspectives, vol. 7, Routledge, 2016), gives a summary that justifies this definition through significant methodological background: 

In current U.S. case law, it might be illegal to publish stolen documentary material, but prior case law rules it legal if the material is "of great public concern", which I think most media would claim the Podesta emails to be. Obviously it is legal to possess what you publish, so it is legal to read it as well. If the Podesta material contains extensive creative work such as books or music, there could be copyright issues involved with downloading those specific files, but as per the previous source, "e-mails would be seen as predominantly factual rather than highly creative." Cuomo has probably confused the role of the media in discussing the unclassified Podesta emails with the role of the media in discussing the classified State Department WikiLeaks material, which is illegal for U.S. government employees to read, and in a gray area with regards to those seeking employment with a U.S. agency. 

The footnoted counterpoint that you offer in the question is apparently dubious. (see following source) But it should be noted as well that there is evidence Tesla was embellishing his own autobiography. He worked for Edison for six months, which is not "nearly a year," and the direct cause for Tesla's resignation was not this incident but rather when Edison tabled another invention of his, in favor of making a mutually beneficial business deal with another company instead. (source and details) So this boils down to precisely what Reddit says it does. It's Tesla's word against the word of Edison's supporters, and O'Neill's biography is responsible for making Edison himself the villain. We can no longer know today what actually happened between Tesla and "the manager" or who "the manager" really was. I think it is plausible to say that O'Neill took Tesla's story and misread it in a way beneficial to imagining Tesla and Edison as direct rivals. Samuel Insull is a likely better candidate for the manager. 

Firishta's number, if indeed it was Firishta's and was not invented from whole cloth by Datta, was clearly off the top of his head. Both Lal and Datta admitted that Moreland's estimate is similarly speculative, and both quoted a demographer named Carl Saunders acknowledging this: "Moreland's figure has been quoted with favour in the census reports of India and no better estimate is available, but its factual basis is of the most slender kind." (Saunders, World Population, quoted in Datta, quoted in Lal p. 21). Lal critiques two estimates found in Colin Clark, Population and Land Use (New York: Macmillan, 1967) and by Pran Nath, Study in the Economic Condition of Ancient India (London: Royal Asiatic Society, 1929) which give the population in AD 1000 as 70 million and 140 million, respectively. Lal does not like either estimate because both writers claim that the population was unchanged between 300 BC and AD 1000, which Lal considers ignorant of the effects of agricultural technology on sustainable population. (Lal, 26n, 28) However, Lal did like Nath's study enough to use his figure of 140 million for 300 BC as a starting point. Another estimate by Colin McEvedy and Richard Jones, Atlas of World Population History (Penguin, 1978), gives 30 million in AD 1000. Maddison Angus, in the OECD report The World Economy: A Millennial Perspective (2001), gives 5 additional recent estimates for AD 1000 ranging from 40 to 77 million and comments, "India does not have statistical records of the same sort as Western Europe, China or Japan, and there is consequently a wide range of views." The population of India according to Lal was 150 million in 1650, 172.5m in 1750, and 170m in 1800 (Lal, 201). These later estimates may be praiseworthy, as Wikipedia insinuates, but Lal's figure for AD 1000 is based almost entirely on his assumption that massacres caused millions of deaths, so writers who use the raw numbers as evidence for a massacre are committing the fallacy of circular logic. Estimates by writers quoted above range between 30 million and 600 million, which indicates a lack of certainty. Lal does provide evidence of massacres in his book, but I am not an expert on medieval India so I will not investigate those claims here. Nothing in this source makes it totally evident to me that we know whether the population really did increase or decrease. In fact Lal admits that premodern primary sources such as Arab travelers are extremely unreliable with numbers. 

How did Christians actually view "ancient learning"? It's well-accepted that while much of Greek science and literature was kept alive in the Muslim world, the survival of Latin literature was thanks to a large and long-lasting project by the Christian emperor Charlemagne: 

But the much later legend about getting rid of "snakes" (which didn't exist in the first place) really is a story about a massive group of venomous creatures who were driven off a hill, as we learn in Jocelyn's 12th century Life of Patrick:
