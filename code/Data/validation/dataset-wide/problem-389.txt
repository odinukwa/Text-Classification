It might depend on the type of werewolf. The classical werewolf of lore is much more a true mix of human and wolf than is the newer, Twilight version (which I believe was later identified merely as a shapeshifter, not a werewolf, however, as the question might also pertain to shapeshifters, I will address it as well). The main difference between the two models is the degree of separation between the wolf and human halves. In the classical lore, the individual is primarily human except at the full moon when he morphs into a half-human, half-wolf mongrel. One might almost say that such a werewolf is only 1/4 wolf, thus possibly expressing traits with only 1/4 the power. If that is the case, the mongrel form (assuming the morphed werewolf wished to look his best while on his killing spree) would probably need a haircut. It seems rather unlikely that a creature that only really exists on the full moon would grow enough hair to require a haircut, but I suppose it's possible. It seems safe to assume that the werewolf, while in human form, and thus expressing human traits, would require regular shearing. In the world of shapeshifters, particularly wolf/human shifters, the separation between the human and wolf sides is much more distinct. Instead of displaying a mash of both human and wolf characteristics, the shapeshifter displays one at a time, meaning that, as a wolf, he would probably not need his fur trimmed. As a man, he would likely require haircuts. Again, it seems unlikely that, even if the wolf wanted a haircut, a barber would oblige. In either case, as I understand the lore, the transformation from human to wolf/wolf-man requires more hair than simply that which is found on the human. Both classical and new-age mythologies portray the wolf form of the werewolf/shifter as being much hairier than the human form, so the creature must grow more hair during the transformation. That means that thousands of follicles go active very quickly, producing massive amounts of keratin in moments. For some reason, this process is quickly stopped after the transformation is complete, leaving us no Rapunzel-esque masses of excess hair. That means that there must be something about the act of shifting that sends the follicles into hyper-drive. On the flip side, when the wolf transforms back into a human, all the extra hair disappears, leaving only what was there originally. Now, I don't believe there is a workable scientific explanation for all the effects of either style of werewolf, and most lore bases the transformations in magic or spirituality or some such, so, going with a magic/religious/unexplained transformation, what happens to one form shouldn't affect the other in terms of hair or nails. Naturally, we would expect injuries to carry over, but superficial things like the hair would be assumed to remain with the form. For the purposes of identification, it is possible that dyeing the hair might transfer, but that depends on the type of magic/religion/other, as well as the intent. If it was a spell, the human's haircut might affect the length of the wolf's fur, but probably not really accurately. A person with long hair might turn into a wolf with longer hair, but a person with a mowhawk probably wouldn't turn into a wolf with one strip of long hair along its back and a woman who shaved her legs almost certainly wouldn't turn into a wolf that was bald from the hips down. If it was some kind of spiritual same-soul-two-bodies thing then one form shouldn't affect the other at all. In the classical style, the creature morphs without conscious thought, sometimes against his will, and loses his ability to ration while morphed, suggesting a heavier biological base of explanation. If the wolf part of the creature takes over, then eventually recedes again taking with it only what if brought, then the two forms should affect one another. If the human is bald (as a baseline example), he will grow x inches of hair. If the human has long hair, he would be expected to still grow x inches of hair because the transformation process doesn't know and doesn't care how long his hair already is, so if the human has short hair, the mongrel will have short hair, and if the human has long hair, the mongrel will have long hair. When he transforms back, he loses x inches of hair, returning him to his pretransformation state. If at some point during his time as a mongrel the werewolf were sedated and his hair cut, the transfomation process would still take back x inches of hair, leaving the resulting human with shorter hair. I highly doubt that any barber would give a discount that encouraged werewolves to return to his shop, no matter how dedicated a customer the werewolf might be. You might be able to work something out with a local groomer. Also, most, if not all, breeds of domesticated dogs do not need haircuts. Some breeds, such as the poodle, have a standard look that was imposed by humans, thus requiring human maintenance, and some breeds, such as the old english sheepdog, have such long hair that it will quickly mat if not cut, but dogs, like cats, do not continuously grow their hair. Perhaps there is some breed out there that does, but at least the vast majority of breeds do not, so it seems unlikely that a werewolf's wolf half would come from one of those breeds. 

The basic premise here is that these creatures (I'm going to call them zappers because I like the name and I don't know what else to call them) can take themselves apart and rebuild themselves elsewhere. For this to happen in any kind of reasonable time and with any kind of reasonable accuracy we must assume that the zappers use different particles. When the zapper takes itself apart, it retains a pattern, a grocery list of all the particles it will need to resemble its physical form. The essence of the zapper then travels to its destination where it collects the necessary particles from its new surroundings, reforming itself. For this model to work, the zapper must have some part, the essence, which is not taken apart during teleportation. This essence must move quickly, must be able to pass through air and objects, and must be capable of recalling matter to it. The best choice for this kind of essence is energy, preferably in the form of electricity. This packet of electricity contains all the zapper's memories and personality, as well as the code for its physical body. When the zapper teleports, the electrical essence zaps to the new location almost instantaneously and reforms the body, leaving the conscious zapper unaware of the process. Depending on how aware you want the zappers to be, you could make the essence record the body as it was upon destruction, or as it was originally. The former will allow the zapper to retain such distinctions as scars and tattoos, the latter will allow the zapper to heal whenever he teleports. With this model in mind, there is a very simple way to prevent teleporting: insulated rooms. Just as we humans coat metal tools in rubber to prevent electrocution, a thick rubber wall will stop the zapper essences from leaving the room, giving them no choice but to reform within the walls. At best, they might be able to zap from one side of the room to the other, but with small enough room, this shouldn't be a problem. As mentioned, slavery is a state of mind as well as a state of being, so within a few generations, the zappers shouldn't need to be contained in this way, except, perhaps, as punishment. To capture a zapper, all one needs is a localized chemical reaction that consumes energy. Basically, all you have to do is fire a drained battery at the zapper, then pick it up and carry it home. When you're ready to let it out, just reverse the reaction, releasing the energy. This might wreck havoc on the zapper's memories and personality (but that's really up to you to decide how resistant the zappers' essences are) but somehow I doubt the enslaving race will be too troubled by that. This also makes zappers easy to transport and store, an ideal quality in an enslaved race. If the storing does destroy some or all of the zapper's personality, so much the better for enslavement. The reason zappers can't teleport off-planet is that space is simply too empty. Under the pressures of their planet's atmosphere, the zapper essences can hold themselves together for the brief periods of time in which they are loose energy, but in space, the pull is far too great. The essences just fly apart, lost to space in a thousand directions. Not to mention, even if the essence could get where it was going it wouldn't be able to find all the particles it would need to recreate its body. Maybe if it made it to another planet, but there are still no guarantees, not to mention the zapper would have to know where it was going in order to get there. It certainly couldn't reform in space.
