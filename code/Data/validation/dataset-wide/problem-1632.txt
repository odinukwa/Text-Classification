National Health Service the healthcare system for England found that the study was "limited" and said: 

Indication from family trees Finally, there seems to be a match for a person named Adetayo Ayowale O A Onile-Ere on FamilySearch.org: 

Update: I was able to download a free sample report from their website. You can see it here. You may read it and in case you're skeptical about any unreferenced claim there, you can ask about it. Additional note: It is reported that in Singapore, the study found, a loaf of bread, a bottle of wine, and a pack of cigarettes will together cost the equivalent of $39.11. Can you relate to that, since you were in Singapore? This would cost in my country Lebanon, 5$ or 6$ only. 

The archive of Google News helps again answer this question where Spock denies that he recanted his child-rearing teachings later in life in The Milwaukee Journal - Apr 14, 1974.

Going through their twitter account, you will find out a tweet where they express pride and satisfaction for their viral but fake story that have circulated and made online headlines on Yahoo, DailyMail, Huffington Post, EliteDaily, Metro and many more... 

Back in 2012 this probably wasn't answerable, now after Gazelle's research which was conducted in 2014 I can attempt to answer this. 

Conclusion: You can't conclude by proof or competent evidence that Hermann Göring was a transvestite or a cross-dresser. 

In early 2014, Truecaller received a $18.8 million investment led by Sequoia Capital. In October of the same year, they received $60 million from Niklas Zennstrom's Atomico investment firm and from Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. This gives a possible indication also that the service works. 

I am still skeptical how do you know those eye symptoms resulted from a computer screen? A study compared computer and hardcopy conditions with regard to blurred vision during a task. 30 normal subjects read identical text (same size, contrast, viewing angle, luminance) aloud either from a desktop computer screen or a printed hardcopy page at a viewing distance of 50 cm for 20 minutes. Immediately following completion of the reading task, subjects completed a written questionnaire asking about their level of ocular discomfort during the task. 

Most of them give reference to this article (who apparently is offline now): $URL$ Fortunately, I could get a version from Wayback Machine, you can see it here. The article is small, unreferenced and full of logical falacies. For example, they say that: 

What is worth noting about this match is that Vera Cruz is listed as a mother for Adetayo Ayowale O A Onile-Ere. 

If you go through the main page of their official website btsunited.com, you'll find the official version of the advertisement uploaded on their website: 

Personal computers are possibly one of the most empowering tool humanity has ever created. They're tools of communication, creativity, and they can be shaped by the user. But, of course they "computers" come with various negative effects. One negative effect is affecting your eyesight. Computer users (including me) have reported many eyesight problems like blurred vision, redness in the eyes, fatigue, eye strain, dry eyes, irritated eyes, double vision, vertigo/dizziness, polyopia, and difficulty refocusing the eyes resulting from computer display. The medical community had to create a term for all those eyesight problems, which is: Computer vision syndrome (CVS) It is defined by the American Optometric Association as: 

In the corner of the image, one can read "Ask about illuminati". For example this site has an article called Disney’s Ducktales Exposed: “Ask About Illuminati” where they make the claim: 

After endless research, I was able to find a partial view of the article from the Redbook Magazine from February 1974, p. 29:

After extensive research, I found out that a lot of books (book 1, book 2, book 3, book 4, etc...) referenced the source of your quote to the Redbook magazine: 

As for recent statistics from credible sources on this question of high school graduates and book reading, PewResearchCenter, a conductor of public opinion polling, demographic research, content analysis and other data-driven social science research was kind to publish this reading snapshot in January 16, 2014: 

Different theories have emerged to hypothesize about origins for the human immunodeficiency infection (HIV) and (AIDS), with theories emerging from coincidental acts to evidently intentional acts. The Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) theory is one of those theories. Edward Hooper, is a British writer best known for his book, The River, which investigated the origins of AIDS and made a case for the OPV AIDS hypothesis, which states that the AIDS virus was accidentally created by scientists testing an experimental polio vaccine (OPV). Source: Edward Hooper, The River, Little Brown and Company, 1999, ISBN 0-316-37261-7. His theory speculated that early bunches of the oral polio antibody (OPV) developed in societies of chimpanzee kidney cells, tainted with a chimpanzee infection, were the first wellspring of HIV-1 in Central Africa. Here are the studies: Chimpanzee's DNA not found Scientists have analyzed five samples of OPV in storage at the Wistar Institute, including one from a batch used in the Belgian Congo between 1958 and 1960, they didn't find any chimpanzee's DNA.

Fortunately, there is. This photo is originated from an official source. Frank Sinatra was honored with an official $1,500 book limited with 1,000 copies. 

As for as I am concerned, having found that Wuhan Evening News reported this news, it be would be unsound to make conclusion. 

But, in the end there is no compelling evidence which proves computer use causes myopia. Which really means that there is absence of evidence, but not necessarily evidence of absence. It is still a theory. Takeaway:

In addition, Adrian Shine of the Loch Ness Centre was interviewed and suggested that the footage showed an otter, seal or water bird. (5) Conclusion Due to Holmes weak credibility (2) and the fact that there is no hard evidence that a Nessie exists (1) , it is less likely that the video shows Nessie and more likely that the footage shows an otter, steal, water-bird or a beaver (4), as experts suggest. 8 years passed since this video was shot, and apparently no creature was identified in this video. As skeptics we can say that we can probably never know the origin of what was captured on video, due to the fact that color , size and distance were not visible in the video. (3). 

Is CVS Permanent? Currently it seems that there is no clinical evidence linking computer use results to permanent vision problems. So, it is unlikely that the use of computers causes permanent changes or damage to the eyes or visual system. See: 

Evidence of brain shrinkage: Quoted from Dr. Joanna Moncrieff, a Senior Lecturer in psychiatry at University College London and a practising consultant psychiatrist, since she did the research: 

UPDATE 2: According to Submarine cables and the oceans: connecting the world report, external human aggression causes more faults for cables more than any other category, with fishing accounting for nearly half of all reported faults. Anchoring is the second major cause of faults, with dredging, drilling, seabed abrasion and earthquakes also causing significant numbers. However, natural hazards including seabed abrasion, shark bites account for less than 10 per cent of all faults. Shark bites account for only 0.5% for all faults. They're consider a threat, but it's a minor threat. 

And they point out the image, they also link to a YouTube video showing the Ducktales scene, which seems to be the current source. The publisher of the video (which received 300K views since 3 years), is receiving full advertisements from YouTube, and seems to be linking to for-profit-website, it does raise suspicions of whether this really happened in the show. Other articles claiming the same thing: here and here I'm really skeptical and I do not really trust that unofficial video on YouTube show; we all know there are numerous bored professional video editors who love to make false claims or otherwise. I would like to know if this was really introduced by the producer, Disney. Maybe finding an official source of the cartoon will help us be sure whether Disney actually added this or not. IMPORTANT: I do not care if it was put in harmless, trivial, humourous way or not. I just want to know if this is real or not. 

After it went viral, scientists in the US have been curious, and later they confirmed that a simple bounce test can be used as a technique if a battery is charged. A team led by Daniel Steingart of Princeton University, published their paper here, you can read it here. As quoted by the study: 

Conclusion: It is a fact that sunlight exposure causes most of the wrinkles on our faces. It ages us because exposure to ultraviolet light destroys elastin and promotes wrinkles. There is no doubt one should use sunscreen when exposed to the sun.

So, there is a correlational link between "conversion therapy" and "harm" but not a causal link. Note that this is not a question of whether "conversion therapy" works or not, but only whether it causes harm. 

In the past, if a male wanted to marry a female, he'd transfer property, animals or goods to her father. The idea is of giving something valuable in return of a marriage; marriage was just a business deal about trading girls and money. This is called dowry (1) and it is well evidenced in the bible, for example: Genesis 34:12: 

Link between computer/cellphone use and Nearsightedness (known also as myopia) Pubmed mentions that: 

In his theory, Ramachandran claims that the part of the brain that corresponds to the genitalia and feet are adjacent to each other in the brain’s body image map which results in cross-wiring in the brain between the foot and the genital parts, and therefore the sexual interest in feet. Many sites took this statement as their reference to accounnce the cause of foot fetish such as livescience.com. Is there is some scientific evidence that shows that this specific cross-wiring in the brain may or will cause foot fetish? How does Ramachandran's scientific theory stand in the medical domain? And is it scientifically verified that genitalia and feet nerves are cross-wired in the brain? 

Regardless of whether The Illuminati (plural of Latin illuminatus, "enlightened") is/was real or fictitious, many people online seems to be claiming that in one episode of Ducktales this scene appears: 

Warning: Disturbing footage and scenes there. A public report to the U.N. Commission on Human Rights in 1999, the Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women concluded that the Indonesian security forces used rape in West Papua:
