There is a fair amount of ambiguity to this question. The first question is: what is the yield curve? A fixed income investor may refer to the yields across all maturities as the yield curve, while economists pick the difference in yields between two arbitrary maturities as the yield curve. Which two? Typical choices are the spread between the 2-year and 10-year bond, or the spread between the 3-month Treasury bill rate and the 10-year. The quality of a recession indicator depends which pair you choose. The second question is: what country are we talking about? The yield curve is often described as a good recession indcator for the United States (which can be seen by looking at the time series of the 2-year/10-year Treasury spread, and compare them to recession dates. It is less clear how well it works for other countries. There is a simple theoretical reason why it works. Under any modern financial model of the risk-free interest rate curve, we can see that term interest rates are roughly equal to the average of the expected overnight rate to its maturity, plus a term premium. (Technically, the average is a geometric average, since we are compounding an investment at the overnight rate.) As long as the term premium is not significantly negative, an inverted yield curve implies that the expected path of short-term rates is heading lower. The usual reason for a central bank to cut rates significantly is a recession (either domestically, or in trading partners). In other words, if an inverted yield curve is a good recession indicator, it is just telling us that bond investors may be good at forecasting recession odds. Do we have reason to expect that they are perfect forecasters? Probably not. There’s any number of things that could distort bond market pricing, or else bond investors could herd into a poor forecast. Attempting to do statistical analysis of the yield curve without taking into account the changing institutional structure of the bond market is problematic. I am not aware of any reason that suggests the inverted yield curve causes recessions under current institutional arrangements. (I am admittedly biased.) This is because developed country banking systes have much tighter control of interest rate risk now. This was not the case earlier (e.g., 1970s), and it may be that for some countries now, interest rate risk is not being hedged. If you are interested in that question, I suggest asking it in a separate question, and you should specify what countries and eras you are interested in. The title of the question refers to prediction; a lot of readers would not relate that to causing recessions. 

In his section “Coda” he then argues that “there are no effective barriers to bank expansion and thus to the destabilising impact of banks on demand.” In other words, he is worried more about the instability created by banking as a result of the lack of regulation of their portfolio growth, rather than whether people lose money. 

As for why this matters, this shows up in the rest of Chapter 10. He describes how bank lending determines the level and type of investment. 

As I noted in the comment, buying a major position in a commodity does not qualify as an arbitrage, rather it would be informally referred to as “cornering the market.” I am unsure whether there is any theoretical work on such strategies. However, from a practical perspective, we can see that it is hard to characterise what would happen. I will assume that we are talking about a physical commodity; things might be different for a financial asset. Firstly, going into a market and trying to buy up the supply is difficult. There will be both physical commodities to buy, as well as derivatives (such as futures). How exactly can you get the physical inventories away from other commodities traders and consumers, when they see someone buying up all the other sources? You need to find a way to buy up the commodity ahead of time quietly, and then you need some event (such as a bad harvest) wiping out the holdings of the other commodity traders. Cornering a market has been done, but you need particular circumstances to make it work. (I would recommend looking up the history of the Hunt Brothers and silver.) The next problem is your ability to take advantage of your high inventory position. The producers of the commodity will ramp up production (and demand may be destroyed) if you try to only sell at a high price. You could get stuck with a large inventory of a commodity that has fallen in price. If you borrowed to finance your position, you might be forced into distressed selling - and everyone will know about it. In other words, there are a lot of possibilities, and there is no easy way to characterise what will happen to the price. Things are different if you control the production of the commodity. That ends up just being te situation of a monopoly (or oligopoly). There is a large literature on monopolies in economics; I am not familiar with it. 

The operating procedures the Fed has followed has changed over the years. I will first discuss the situation pre-2008, and then discuss the current situation. Situation 1994-2008. The Fed has an interest rate target, and the amount of excess reserves in the system was typically very small. Under normal circumstances, the Fed controls the amount of reserves in the system with open market operations. If nothing else happens, if the Fed buys \$1 billion in securities, it will create \$1 billion in reserves. (Exceptions include: banks may exchange reserves for notes and coins, and if there was a shortage of reserves, banks would be forced to go to the discount window to borrow to meet reserve requirements.) In other words, the Fed has to supply whatever reserves are required by the banking system. Banks lend first, then search for reserves later. If there is a shortage in the system, the Fed has to create reserves to meet demand, or else the interbank rate will go above target. This means that reserves follow lending decisions, and the only influence the Fed has on the level of the money supply is through the moderating effect of interest rates on expectations. Note that this explanation is known as "endogenous money", as opposed to "exogenous money", and which version is correct is/was a major debate. The endogenous money stance seems to be closer to the modern consensus; Monetarists were the main propenents of exogenous money. I believe that the modern version of "exogenous money" is more complex than the old belief (the central bank directly sets the level of the money supply), and the short-term story ends up being similar to my description above. Unfortunately, undergraduate textbooks tend to push the old exogenous money story. From this standpoint, changing the reserve ratio will do very little, it just changes the amounts of reserves that the Fed has to create/destroy in order to hit its interest rate target. The reserve ratio has an effect on the competitive position of banks versus non-bank financial firms, and so reserve ratio changes end up having a distorting effect on competition. The general irrelevance of reserves in monetary policy explains why reserve requirements were abolished in many developed countries, such as Canada. The current situation features large amounts of excess reserves; changing the reserve ratio would imply no change in policy, as all that happens is that some existing reserve positions are reclassified, with no other effect.
