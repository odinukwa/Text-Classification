It's not hard to see that the right side of the identity is at most $u$, so assuming the identity fails it's strictly less than $u$, so since $\mathbb{B}$ is separative there's a generic $G$ containing $u$ avoiding the right side of the identity. It's not hard to see from here that $\dot{g}^G$ will dominate all the ground model's reals. 

With the help of Jason's answer to the question I linked to, I think I might be able to solve this one. The key is to show that $P_{\kappa}^{V[G]}(\lambda) \in M[G\times H]$. Let's simply denote this set by $X$. An element $x$ of $X$ can be regarded as a function $x : \omega_1 \to \lambda$, which will be a subset of $\omega_1 \times \lambda$. A nice name for such a subset is a map, in $V$, from $\omega_1 \times \lambda$ to the collection of antichains in $\mathbb{P}$. Since $\mathbb{P}$ has the $\kappa$-chain condition and $\mathbb{P} \in M$, $M$ correctly knows the set of antichains of $\mathbb{P}$. Since $M^{\lambda} \subset M$, $M$ correctly knows the set of nice $(V,\mathbb{P})$-names for subsets of $\omega_1 \times \lambda$, let's call this set $Y$. Now $\mathbb{P}$ names are $j(\mathbb{P})$ names (since $\mathbb{P} \subset j(\mathbb{P})$), so we get that $X = \{ \dot{x}^{G\times H}\ |\ \dot{x}^{G\times H} : \omega_1 \to \lambda, \dot{x} \in Y \} $ This is since $\dot{x}^{G \times H} = \dot{x}^G$ for nice $(V,\mathbb{P})$-names. So $X \in M[G \times H]$ as desired. 

Moreover, the desire to "solve" CH was the main motivation, or at least one of the main motivations, for: 

This fact follows from a simple application of Ramsey's theorem. The following statement is not amenable to the same Ramsey-theoretic argument, and is in fact false: 

Not an answer, just a series of observations which will hopefully be of some use, and too long for a comment. The last observation might be relevant to your question about whether $G$ is the direct sum of countably many copies of $S_\infty$, unless I've over-simplified something. 

Math is vast - People somehow know that most academic fields are vast, but they don't know this about math. For instance, someone who has only studied up to classical mechanics has still heard about general relativity, classical mechanics, fluid dynamics, electricity and magnetism, etc. On the other hand, a lot of people honestly think there's nothing more to math than matrices and calculus. Math is about cool ideas - It's about coming up with cool ideas, exploring them, figuring out facts about them, and proving this facts using both creativity and logic. It's not about crunching out numbers using complicated formulas. Math is not about the real world - This is an overgeneralization to the point that it's false, but it might be closer to the truth than what your audience thinks math is about. Historically, math has absolutely been about modeling the real world and solving real world problems, but for various reasons, much of modern math is done purely for its own sake, and the content it discusses is very abstract. People will try to relate what you explain to them to something they already know, and this is an entirely natural thing to do, but it's almost surely bound to miss the point. Math is new - People will often look at you quizzically when you say you study math, and ask you, "what's there left to figure out?" Although the formulas of single variable calculus that they're familiar with have been figured out for centuries, there are constantly new questions arising in math, especially since math is so vast. Math is a different language - First of all, there's a lot of technical strange-sounding vocabulary. Secondly, there's a lot of technical familiar-sounding vocabulary that means something different in natural language - be careful about how you use the word "axiom" for instance. 

You can see it stated as Conjecture 3.3 in Todorcevic's "Combinatorial Dichotomies in Set Theory". I'm interested in this conjecture and determining its consistency strength, but in order to get a feel for it I want to first look at it in a special case in which it's supposed to be (according to Todorcevic, if I understood what he told me correctly) provable from ZFC alone. I'll actually list three special cases of increasing generality; an answer to the last case would be ideal but I'd be happy to see an answer for the first case. 

Claim: The $\mathrm{pcf}$ structure on $(\aleph_1 \times \aleph_2 \times \dots) \times (\aleph_1 \times \aleph_2 \times \dots) \times \dots$ gives nothing new. Proof: For notational convenience, let $A : \omega \to \mathrm{Reg}$ be defined by $A(n) = \aleph_n$ and let $B : \omega \cdot \omega \to \mathrm{Reg}$ be defined by $B(\omega\cdot m + n) = \aleph_n$. Define $$\mathrm{pcf}(A) = \{\mathrm{cf}(\Pi_{n<\omega}A(n)/U)\ :\ U \in \beta \omega\}$$ $$\mathrm{pcf}(B) = \{\mathrm{cf}(\Pi_{\alpha<\omega\cdot\omega}B(\alpha)/U)\ :\ U \in \beta (\omega\cdot\omega)\}$$ Where $\beta X$ denotes the set of all ultrafilters on $X$. It's not hard to see that $\mathrm{pcf}(A) \subseteq \mathrm{pcf}(B)$ and since $\mathrm{pcf}(A)$ is an interval of regular cardinals, it suffices to show that $\max \mathrm{pcf}(B) = \max \mathrm{pcf}(B)$. We know that we can find an everywhere-pointwise-dominating family on $\Pi A$ of size $\lambda := \max\mathrm{pcf}(A)$. If we can find a dominating family on $\Pi B$ of that same size, we'll be done. So, given a dominating family $\mathcal{F}$ on $\Pi A$ of size $\lambda$, just let $\mathcal{F}^\ast \subseteq \Pi B$ consist of functions of the form: $$f^\ast (\omega\cdot m + n) = f(n)$$ for each $f \in \mathcal{F}$. Now given $g \in \Pi B$, define: $$g'(\omega\cdot m + n) = \sup_{m' \in \omega}g(\omega\cdot m' + n)$$ We see that $g' \geq g$ everywhere pointwise, and $g' \in \Pi B$ since we're always taking countable suprema within uncountable regular cardinals. Since $g'$ has the same value at any of its coordinates that correspond to the same $\aleph_n$, it's clear that there's some $f \in \mathcal{F}$ such that $f^\ast \in \mathcal{F}^\ast$ dominates $g'$ everywhere, and hence $g$ everywhere. 

indescribable - no, since it's not even $\Pi ^0 _2$-indescribable Jonsson - no, the algebra $(\omega, n \mapsto n \dot{-} 1)$ has no proper infinite subalgebra Ramsey - no, the function $F : [\omega ]^{< \omega} \to \omega$ defined by $F(x) = 1$ if $|x| \in x$ and $0$ otherwise has no infinite homogeneous set measurable: 

If $I$ is an ideal on a set $X$, the saturation of $I$ is the saturation of the Boolean algebra $\mathbb{B} = \mathcal{P}(X)/I$. Let $\mathbb{B}'$ be the completion of $\mathbb{B}$. The completion clearly has all the antichains of the original algebra, so its saturation can only be higher. But suppose $\mathbb{B}'$ has an antichain $W'$ bigger than any that $\mathbb{B}$ has. Since $\mathbb{B}$ is dense in $\mathbb{B}'$, we can easily obtain from $W'$ an antichain $W \subset \mathbb{B}$ with $|W'| = |W|$, contradiction. ($W$ is obtained by taking, for each element of $W'$, a non-zero element of $\mathbb{B}$ below that element - such elements exist by the density of $\mathbb{B}$ in $\mathbb{B}'$).
