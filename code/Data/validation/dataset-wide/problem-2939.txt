As I am only interested in this fallacy, I am not quoting the other one, as well. So my question is actually simple: what is the difference between the two of them? As Plato and Aristotle, poor me, I am, too, quite unable to distinguish (1) from (2). 

Here is my hypothesis: A personal God can only exist in the form of the human consciousness. Human consciousness, while being part of the human individuality, is not to be identified to it. Somehow, it is always both inside and outside the human individual that it individualizes as "that" human individual. And it is exactly this duality of place of the human consciousness that can make it be a personal God: as long as you believe in yourself (in the individuality of your self), you actually believe in a kind of personal God, who is both you (inside you) and your individuality-giving creator (outside you). 

The base position in a scientific endeavour is that we don't assume something to exist (or to have some specific attribute) until we have some reason to think that it does - i.e., evidence to support it. So yes: atheism is both scientific and supported by the current body of evidence. If you can design a proper experiment and collect data that casts doubt on the current atheistic conclusion, go for! Just know that your god-concept will not only have to explain your own experimental results but also the decades of null results. 

Ah. Short answer: No, and a solid argument for the opposite. ASSUMPTIONS: First, by secular argument I assume that you mean one that does not include magic - i.e., that relies only on what we know of the physical universe, how it works, and some reasonable extrapolation from there into areas where the results aren't in yet. Second, be aware that you are taking as a given that something called a 'soul' exists. While the nature and properties of 'soul' are not well defined, I will assume for the sake of argument that by 'soul' we can mean 'some core aspect of self'. Third, we must assume that the 'soul' has some effect on/control of our minds/bodies while we are alive in order to meaningfully represent 'us'. This should follow fairly obviously from the second assumption, but it is a critical consideration to keep in mind. Fourth, in order for a soul to carry that core aspect of self into the future postmortem, we must assume the soul pre-death is largely the same as the soul post-death. 

For me it helps to frame the topic from the central objective of his philosophy, which one might put as: the liberation of humanity from the enchainment of exploitative modes of production. If we assume this tenant, every act can be judged on the basis of whether or not it leads to greater liberation or greater exploitation. Identity politics is politics pure and simple, BUT the question from a Marxian standpoint is what interests the particular identity serves. Marx was adamantly against nationalist and racial identities, not simply because he disliked nation-states or had a hatred of racial classification theories, but because they both constitute a "superstructure" created by and reinforcing the production relations constituting the economic structure of society. They are epiphenomenal to what is "really" going on in capitalist modes of production. 

Part of Marx's legacy was the realization that identity need not be passive. The International Workers movement he helped to fomented was perhaps the largest secular transnational identity formations on the planet. One need not be passive (or reactive) in the face of identity. We have the capacity to forge new ones, based on new lines in the sand, the communities we seek to establish. What he was fully aware of that perhaps many of his followers weren't was just the extent to which the politics of identity needed to be a continual struggle or effort if they were to succeed. And not as something separate from politics in general, but as a central feature insofar as it is a type of branding on individuals who can either be supporters or who can take on an opposing identity of the enemy of what you represent. 

CONCLUSION: We know the laws of physics well enough to rule out all possible sources of a 'soul-force' that could both drive our bodies while we're alive and persist after our death. Whatever a 'soul' might be, if it has any relevance to us while we are alive it also dies with us. 

The short answer is: We cannot. Assuming that we humans have finite powers of perception, it is impossible to distinguish a being that exactly fills our perception window from one that extends beyond it. For example: 

... ? ... Alright, let's start with the second half: We don't need a specific 'Theory of Reality' because Reality is what all of our scientific theories are trying to describe. Our current 'Theory of Reality' would be: While it may not be definitive (since we obviously don't know everything - if we ever did, science would stop), it's certainly quite comprehensive. Now back to the first half: Consciousness, or the perception thereof. We're at an exciting point in our investigations of the universe. We can honestly and confidently state that we've got a pretty good grasp of the fundamentals: we know the basic forces, we know the basic particles. From these basic concepts we get a lot of emergent behaviour - that is, phenomena that we observe at larger scales that are not apparent at the more minute scale. Physics, chemistry and biology are each very broad areas of study that are built upon or reduce down to each other, and at each level we see emergent properties or behaviours that are not obviously true when zoomed to a different level. There is no reason (other than hubris) to believe that our consciousness is something other than an emergent property of our biology, and plenty of reasons to suspect that it is. We know that different conscious states can be induced through specific chemicals or physical trauma; we know how hideously complicated a neural net can be; we know that there's no evidence for any new forces that could affect a physical object (such as a ghost/spirit driving your body as some separate thing). This is not necessarily a bad or scary conclusion, no more so than the discovery that, at the atomic level, solid objects are mostly empty space. We're not going to suddenly sink through the floor, and we're not going to suddenly stop thinking just because consciousness is emergent biology, biology is emergent chemistry and chemistry is emergent physics. 

It depends on how the word final is to be understood. If it is to be understood temporally and chronologically, as is seemingly always understood, death may be final or it may not be final, again, depending on the cultural type of temporality and chronology its finality is "measured" against (e.g. if it is a Christian type of temporality / chronology, death's finality may not be as final as originally thought after all). However, I prefer saying that death is final in a strictly teleological way: for, indeed, the ultimate purpose (or finality) of death seems to be that of no longer allowing life to be active. In denying life its centrality in the universe, I would say that, yes, death is (teleologically) final. 

There is only one necessary being because there is only one concept of "necessari-ness," to which the necessary being belongs, by virtue of its being "necessary," and in which it logically and ontologically partakes. 

Investments (of which the investment of time and resources into research is an example) of any sort are weighed on two things generally: risk and opportunity. Taboo is relevant only insofar as it MIGHT open risks to which the investor may have to account for. When an investor sees opportunity outweighing risk (e.g. likelihood of a significant finding or development), the decision tends to make itself. If someone is interested in taboo for the sake of taboo but not for a weighted probability for reward, there tends to be no motive for an investor to place resources towards that. The key in is always in demonstrating a solid basis, logic and grounding for the research. 

To me there's zero need to have hypercomplex definitions of these things as that's often used to obfuscate the underlying ideas and replace them with particular iterations or particular conceptions as though they somehow foreclose the human capacity to think anew. There are as many past, present and possible iterations of democracies as there are of communisms. 

Atheism is a null hypothesis. Treating atheism scientifically is to say "I don't believe that god(s) have any effect on [thing being studied]". Calling atheism into question is as simple as providing statistically significant data demonstrating an effect where the null hypothesis would predict none. For example, an experiment to test the efficacy of some arbitrary treatment on some arbitrary disease would be roughly formulated as: QUESTION: Does [treatment X] have any effect on [disease/condition Y]? Null hypothesis: Use of [treatment X] is statistically indistinguishable from a similarly-administered placebo. Now, using 'prayer' or any other supernaturally-themed technique as a possible treatment, it's easy to see that the null hypothesis is one formulation of atheism. To scientifically demonstrate that god(s) exist requires starting from an assumption of atheism and then demonstrating that the null hypothesis fails to explain some set of phenomena. The long history of failure to do so is actually evidence against certain god-concepts, especially interventionist ones. Indeed, if god(s) exist, we might expect to see some unambiguous statistical trends such as:
