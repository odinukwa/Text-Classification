In comments, I see you stated it is a Truvativ Crank... The description of your problem sounds like it may be a couple problems. If the bearings in the BB are worn out, it may make any kind of "clunky" feel. But what it sounds like to me is it was ridden with crank pinch bolts loose for a bit and the BB/Crankarm interface might be worn down one way or the other. It's entirely possible you may need to change out either. You said you took it to a shop, may be worth getting a 2nd opinion if you weren't happy with their answer. And this time, ask them to show you what's wrong. As a mechanic, I was never against showing people, "Here's the wear, this is why we recommend changing this". But be aware that at that point, the shop has invested time and money(in employee wages) in that repair. Don't get the answer from the shop, then do the work yourself. No shame in supporting your local shop when you can't diagnose a problem yourself. 

This will always require some DIY, though. For example you could get a small cloth handlebar bag (worn+slightly dirty). Make two button holes (i.e. with the same technique, not for real buttons :) ) in the bag next to the handlebar and use a cable like this to tie it through the button holes to the handlebar with both loop ends hidden in the bag. Now you can lock something to the loop ends of the cable, for example a small lockable pouch made from strong tarpaulin (maybe reinforced by a layer of wire mesh on the outside). But from the outside it looks like any old cloth bag with at most something like a water stained map and a dented apple inside. :) Other idea: Mud stained non-translucent drinking bottle. Just leave it in the bottle-holder with your stuff inside. 

Looks like you may not be closing your Quick Releases quite tight enough, and they are causing the wear. Here's a Park Tool blog post about it: Wheel installation 

Shimano pedals are usually brought up as a good beginner pedal because they are readily available just about everywhere, have several low-cost options, have standards that much of the industry follow for cleats and cross compatibility, and require little maintenance. As you said, they don't get clogged up easily, but it can happen. It just takes a LOT of mud. 

According to my handy-dandy tire/wheel compatibility chart, if your rim is between 17-24.9mm Inside Rim Width, that tire should work fine with your wheel. 

To ride a bike efficiently the ball of your foot must be over the pedal spindle and to answer your question, toe clips and straps are one way of doing this. Up to the mid-80s that was the method used by all serious cyclists. You could buy small, medium and large toe clips for any size of shoe to fix your feet in the correct position. Metal or leather shoe plates with a groove that fitted over the rear pedal plate were nailed to the soles of the leather shoes. The strap had a quick release buckel and went through the pedal and through a loop on the toe clip. When the foot engaged the pedal and the strap was pulled tight your foot was held very tight. To get your foot out you had to bend down and flick the strap buckle, lift your foot and pull it back. The modern method is clipless pedals, they serve the same purpose, fixing the ball of your foot always over the pedal spindle. The initial cost is quite expensive as you require special pedals, shoes and cleats. When the cleats are fitted to the shoes you just have to push your foot down on the pedal till it clicks and to release it you turn your foot to the left or right. The holding tension can be adjusted on the pedals to allow for easier entry and release. They are very good and I recommend you buy them. To see and feel the benefit of fixing your feet just try going up a steep hill or sprinting as hard as you can, or ask yourself why do all the Pros use them. 

Skipping like that is usually worn cassette, chain or chainring(or all 3). Considering it's only doing it in the highest gears, my first guess would have been the cassette. But since it's only a month old, it's much more likely to be the derailleur is mis-aligned just a little bit. You say the derailleur is "ever so slightly bent", that little bit can make a big difference if it's out of alignment with the gears. Also, as Criggie says in the comments, the cables "settle in" a little after about a month or 2 of riding, that's very common, and the reason most shops offer a free tuneup in the first year you own a new bike. May be worth checking to see if the shop you got it from offers one. 

I was wondering whether 20" wheels can get away with smaller rotors than 28" wheels, and if there is a correlation, if it is linear. If it was linear, then 140mm discs on a 20" wheel would be equivalent to 200mm discs on a 28" wheel (and it would be unnecessary to mount anything bigger for pretty much any application). At a given forward speed, the circular speed of the rotor scales up linearly with decreasing wheel size, which on smaller wheels should help with the cooling and should provide higher friction power and thus higher braking power. But I can't find any source confirming this, so I'm asking here. 

If I have a wheel listed as 8-10 speed Campy compatible, will a 11-speed Campagnolo cassette fit it? I seem to remember that they didn't change their standards when they moved to 11-speed, unlike Shimano and SRAM. I just don't have enough experience with Campy to say for sure. Anyone out there done this conversion and can tell me for sure? 

If weather is the concern, yes. You will get some damage over time. Most of that will just be accelerated wear of all the normally wearable components. Keep your chain lubed or it will rust. You will go through grips, tires and seats faster. Any bolts that aren't alloy or stainless will rust. Non-stainless cables will rust through. That is not the only concern though. You will be exposing your bike to a greater opportunity for theft or vandalism, especially when it becomes obvious that bike sits there all day. 

It could be wear or poor adjustment of your hub bearings. Try lifting the bike up at the front and try moving the wheel from one side to the other. There should be little or no movement. 

The chain is what causes all the wear on your drive components. It is called chain stretch but your chain does not stretch it wears at each pin or rivet and increases in length. When this wear is excessive it wears the cassette teeth, chain set teeth and the jockey wheels on your rear gear. When all this equipment is new, Keep it clean and oiled. Buy yourself a chain wear gauge and this will indicate to you when to change your chain before it causes excessive wear on your other drive components. Depending on how much you cycle you might require two new chains a year but that is cheaper than; new cassette, chain rings and jockey wheels. If you cycle for a year and clock up 1000-1500 miles you will require to replace the chain and cassette. If you don't and just replace the chain you will find the gears will jump and that is due to the wear that is on the rear cogs. Hope that helps. 

I don't know about your area, but here around it's quite common to see bikes locked up with some carrier bags attached (not locked) to them. I wouldn't ever do this because my bags are high-quality bags (water-proof, durable, etc.) which are expensive even without content. But this leads me to the following idea: Get a cheap looking bag for your bike, handlebar, saddle, rack, whereever. Then discretely lock that bag shut and to your bike. 

(in short: best solution is in the first bullet point) There are quite a lot of possibilities, as reflected by the myriad of different answers. Here is an attempt at summing them up together with my experiences with them (where available). The problem appears when there is cold wind blowing on the scrotum+perineum and when they are wet and cooled by evaporation. If you are a women who wants to warm your corresponding area: I don't think this answer is actually too gender-specific if you mentally replace any references to male body parts. Should probably work for you too. Just dressing other parts of the body warmer doesn't help. I tested this a couple of times and it really seems to be true. And it makes sense: heating the testicles (and torso in general) is a priority for the body, if that stops working then you have much bigger problems because you definitely have hypothermia. So the solutions need to be about keeping the wind away from this specific area and keeping it dry. The obvious luxury solution is the answer by Criggie: Get a fairing. This keeps the wind away and if it's good the rain too (also: speeeeeeed :). Other solutions work like an additional layer of clothing: Inner layers: 

In UK we drive on the left. When making a right turn on my bike I carry out the same procedure I use when driving my car. I turn my head over my right shoulder and look for a gap in the traffic, when there is a big enough gap I make a positive signal with my right arm and steer out to the left of the line in the center of the road. I apply my brake with my left hand gently to slow my speed a bit while signaling and about 50M before my turning I put both hands on my brakes. Car driver like you to be positive with your positioning and signaling on the road as they can pass me on my left without having to stop. The trafic comming towards me quite often slow down and flash their lights to let me cross. One of the biggest problems is if you are on a steep hill and want to turn right especially if you are climbing out of the saddle. You then have to turn your head and look, then position yourself correctly on the road without a signal, I find that more of a problem. 

I understand this to mean that any condition a-d is sufficient to allow exactly two (motorized) bicycles side by side, with the caveat that you aren't ever allowed to hinder the rest of the traffic. ASVZ Rennvelo (cycling club of large Swiss university) has the following in their introduction document for people interested in joining one of their riding groups: 

So they are interpreting it in a careful way: You should not ride side by side (to switch to the back of the riding formation) if there is any (motorized) traffic overtaking you. Probably there is some other law somewhere defining what exactly is meant by hindering traffic, but I couldn't find it on the spot. Basically I think this boils down to: Only do it on official cycling roads (marked by brown/red signs, no or little motor traffic) and in large groups. That large group should have someone more experienced who can tell when it's okay and when not.
