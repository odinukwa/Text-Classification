The chain is a KMC Rustbuster - it has a special coating on the plates and waterproof grease inside the 'bushing-less' bits. You don't have to do anything to it until the rust-proof coating wears off from the inside of the plates. Therefore, don't do anything to the chain - applying 'WD40' style lubes will only displace the grease by emulsifying it. Wait until this time next year and, if the chain appears 'orange rust coloured' after a ride in the rain, pop some medium flavour oil on it, sparingly. Maybe Electra should have some words in the instruction manual as they have included a rather special chain that you are lucky to own. 

I would purchase a commercial bike cover (available from plenty of places) and use that to keep the bike protected. Before putting it in storage I would use an oily rag to go over the allen key bolts, e.g. in the stem. No more than that is really needed, cleaning the bike up will remove that protective layer of dirt and grime that has built up. To better look after the tyres you may want to put the bike upside down, taking care that the shifters and seat don't get scuffed. 

Who doesn't take at least a passing interest in beautiful members of the opposite or even the same sex? We all do to varying degrees. Theoretically a mirror could help out with such window shopping, it could also help out getting one's hair and make-up right, much like those vanity mirrors they have in car sun-shields. 

No. Dietary supplements are not recommended. Just the all-you-can-eat I-don't-have-to-count-calories cyclist-special-diet of a hearty, big, evening meal. Years ago, when I did a shorter journey than yourself but with a fair amount of free-wheeling/climbing I asked my doctor why I was getting so many colds/feeling-run down. He explained about my immune system, the cold morning air and so on. No references unfortunately, however, you might want to ask your doctor, and in the general context of your riding + times of riding. It is a fair call to ask your doctor what could be going on, a lot of people clutter up doctors waiting rooms with more frivolous complaints. Post what you find back on here. 

This should be a lot easier for you. The bike will have different handling characteristics though. Getting used to this should not take too long, but cycling out of the saddle will feel a bit weird at the start. Plus the front wheel will be lighter on the uphills and when stationary. This isn't a problem, just something to be aware of. With panniers containing A4 objects you can get a problem with heel clearance so do make sure your panniers are going to be okay with carrying them and that they will fit in without too much void space at the bottom. Another option to consider is a saddlebag of the old-fashioned 'Carradice' variety. This will have enough space for your books and will not have any problem with the contents 'floating about' or getting in the way of your heels. Plus the option will not require a rack. 

Nice bikes like that quality Marin and that affordable Fuji are nowhere near as exciting as getting a 'Bicycle Shaped Object' ('BSO')... Instead of getting one of those quality numbers you cannot fully decide on, why not get a 'BSO'? Key advantages: 

They also do a twinset version so that you can have two rings of steel around both of your wheels and working off a common key. I don't own one myself but I know people that do own them. I think that something in the ABUS 'Bordo' range will be perfect for you being able to put your mind at rest when off-bike, yet easy to carry when on-bike. 

Keep it simple is what you want with a mini-pump, it only has to get you home and you hopefully will have a proper track pump with gauge at home. 

@zenbike is right on this - it is a common problem. What happened was that the old, 'stretched' chain damaged the rear sprockets. Look closely and you will see that the shape made by the sprockets is an elongated 'u' shape, particularly so on the sprockets prone to skipping (the smaller sprockets). There is the option to replace the sprockets, however, you will need a special tool to remove the sprockets and you may not have the money for the tools + sprockets right now. In the past, when confronted with this situation, I have continued to ride and, after not too long a time, the new chain 'stretches' to suit the sprockets and no longer skip. It need not stretch to the length of your old chain, just 'grow' the tolerances required to work with the setup that you have. It is up to you whether you follow this 'cheapskate' option, however, you will need to remember not to ride out of the saddle on the gears where skipping is a problem. Since you may have already damaged the new chain anyway and it will not be suited to a brand new sprocket set, you may want to see how you get on running 'cheapskate'. However, I cannot stress enough the importance: do remember to ride in the saddle as a jumping chain when out of the saddle is likely to cause you an accident when you least need it. After a short period, surprisingly short, the tolerances should be good and you'll get a bit more life out of your sprocket set. Eventually though you will have to replace sprocket+chain. Don't wait for the gears to start jumping again, check the wear of the chain. Too much wear will damage the front chainset and that will cost real money. There are tools for measuring chain wear, personally I prefer to just put a screwdriver under the most forward part of the chainset when the chain is on the outer ring and see how much you can pull it forward. If this gets to more than 5mm or so you know it is a badly worn chain. That is pure rule of thumb requiring experience, but that has worked for me in the past and I do not personally own a chain wear tool. 

Your best bet is to look beyond the bike forums and head into the world of cars. I know cars and mountain bikes are slower than the world of cycling, but carbon fibre is now accessible to the motorist. Some of them polish and polish and polish and polish. Zaino is well worth a Google... 

North Shore!!! Yep, there is a name for it and in the UK (and presumably Canada) it is known as 'North Shore'. This is a shorthand for British Columbia riding style on trails exactly as you describe. Even the bike manufacturers have cottoned onto the trend, plus the editors of Wikipedia: 

The trick with rim brakes is to get ones with replaceable blocks. In that way you can setup the brakes once so that they have perfect toe-in (small gap at back so they do not squeal) and so that they hit the rim dead-centre (not at an angle, falling off the bottom or hitting the tyre). Then, when the brakes get worn you can simply replace the inserts and not have to start again with the setup. Due to different places selling different stuff and having made an investment in your setup, it then becomes a matter of what are the most widely available inserts. In the UK this probably means the 'Aztec' brand. From my personal experience the after-market Aztec blocks and shoes are better than the cheeze-o-blocks that Shimano supply. 'Kool Stop' are also pretty good and widely available in selected markets. As for choice of rubber, if you are undecided, what is wrong with dual compound? In that way you get durability and stopping power all in one. I am not wanting to specify a shop/endorse a brand, however, here is what you should be looking for (as Googled earlier). You can always try the different compounds to see what works best front/rear, what wears your rims out quickest (soft on rear is a good idea as rear rims wear quicker) and what fits your budget. Moving forward, the replacement shoes are a double whammy of time savings and money savings. Not only are they quicker to replace, they are cheaper and you do not lose your settings. And finally... Enjoy your tour! 

Since you have gone for steel rims and need to stop in the wet and are unlikely to upgrade to alloy rims straight away, I think you are deserved of a practical answer... In the wet, with regular brake blocks, the alloy rim will have a better coefficient of friction than the steel rim. This much is known and these brake blocks are the wrong ones for your steel rims. You need the brake blocks designed for the job, the ones with a leather face: 

Campagnolo derailleurs come in three lengths, short, medium and large. To determine the size measure it. The centre to centre distance between the sprockets is 55, 72.5 and 89 mm and my guess is that you have a medium flavour rear derailleur... How much are you selling it for, b.t.w.? 

Those are pricey, but my Alien 1 has lasted for more than a decade and I still get compliments when I whip it out to fix someone's barbecue or assemble some IKEA furniture with it (I always carry it). The Alien series include a spoke wrench. You can ride a long way with a broken spoke and you can also ride a long way without finding a bike shop able to sell you replacement spokes. Replacement spokes are not big sellers in bike shops, however, if you are travelling with tent etc. then you will have more load than normal and spare spokes are advised under such circumstances. As a rule of thumb, if you are travelling some distance with loads of stuff then take spare spokes. Otherwise don't bother. I would ride Lands End to John O'Groats in the UK without them but not a tour of the American South West. If you are taking them then you will need the correct lengths for the front, the back right and the back left. Typically these are all different lengths. These can be glued to the inside of your seatpost or taped to your chain-side chain-stay (to act as a chain guard). A pack of 'Handy Andy' wet-wipes are useful if you do get having to get your hands dirty. They are dual use in that you can also use them to freshen up for when you meet 'civilians' and clean yourself if you have an accident. Speaking of which, be realistic about what you need in case of an accident. In practice I have only ever found a roll of bandage tape, track mitts and warm clothing to be useful. If you get larger wounds or other problems you really need to be phoning for a taxi or flagging down a car. Sun cream is also of great use, remember that tarmac reflects UV light and you can find yourself burning up on the nose and the back of you calves before you get to tea-time. As for your bike in an accident, the aforementioned multi-tool should have everything you need to straighten the handlebars out with. For longer trips a spot of oil is useful for the chain but even then you do find bike shops on the way and you can delay that purchase until you need it. It is your choice as to whether you go risk adverse and carry everything or take the chances by carrying next to nothing. For me less is definitely more preferable. I learned this the expensive way, a week into my first tour, at the sight of my second really big hill, I dumped off a small fortune of clothing and bike spares into a bin. Thereafter I could travel further and faster plus I had space to amass a small library of books, postcards and other goodies that I would not have been able to carry otherwise. This was not the end of it though, further into the tour I threw out a perfectly good set of high-end front panniers and slimmed down to absolute essentials (I had a two-week rule - if I did not use it in two weeks it went). 

Keep these for an eBay sale - they are hard to come by and desired by those that desire them... The Suntour versions of these mounted onto regular bosses, the helical part was all in the bulky pivot part of the levers. So yes you can swap them out for normal 'linear-pull' style brakes. 

The scalpel blade is for tidying up gravel rash, the tape to bandage oneself up with. I keep both of these items in the handlebar bag front pocket for ease of access. Sometimes I get a bit faint if I look at a 'flesh would' and it is helpful to be able to patch up the damage quickly without having to look at it for any longer than needed. All the other items are 'in stock items' carried anyway. Warm clothing, i.e. the fleece jacket is important for those times when one's body does not do a good job of keeping itself warm. The spare T-shirt can be used for a larger scale bandage, in conjunction with the tape. Water is obviously useful for cleaning oneself up with, as are the cleaning wipes. Aspirin does have an effect on blood and how quickly it clots, some people may want to take a different headache relieving drug, e.g. paracetamol. I don't have many headaches but I do carry a couple of aspirin tablets in my wallet out of habit. The Pen Knife is a 'dual use' item for general camping, however, the tweezers have came in handy many times, hence a mention. Fortunately I have only suffered 'flesh wounds' on tour (and mountain biking). I have yet to use the surgical scalpel blade but it weighs next to nothing so it gets carried. Only the tape is a real necessity, having proven its worth in the field. I see that the sports-injury brace is cited by others here, I have never needed such an item ever, on the bike or off it. For my first ever tour I did carry lots of stuff that others thought I should take and I bought into the 'better safe than sorry' risk-averse thinking. Three days in and I dumped off a lot of things that were not necessary and the 'elephant sized' bandages and other silly gubbins had to go. It came down to realistic basics for the first aid supplies - some tape to patch myself up with and the sterile scalpel blade in case of gravel rash problems. 

Go lo-tech and bolt a crate to the top of a 4-point pannier rack, use wing-nuts to secure it with the wing-nuts inside the box so you can take the contraption off quite easily. Then put whatever you want inside and secure with bungee cords, bits of ugly string and a bit of unobtrusive tarpaulin. Make it look like you carry your dog in the back, totally agricultural. Anyone wanting to steal your bread and shampoo and soap will need lots of hands or a bag of their own. They would also have to be quick as 'it appears that you will be back in a matter of seconds' and anyone that does bother to steal your bread probably needs it more than you. Posh solutions have been marketed in the past, however, they attract thieves. But, if that is what you want, put a motorcycle helmet box on the back - with wing-nuts inside - and that will blend into the environs really well as people walk past those all the time without wanting to pop them open. You can probably get a second hand one on eBay and that might blend in even more, plus you won't be so concerned about drilling holes in the bottom of it to adapt it to your 4-point rear rack. 

A genuine LBS (that does lots of workshop repairs) will hopefully have a spare rear mech for your son's bike although this may be in a plastic bag without a manual in the workshop, probably without a price sticker on it. Reason being that rear mechs on 20"/24" wheel 'youth' bikes get damaged all the time (because of how such bikes get dropped onto the pavement). Take the advice of the LBS and ask - chances are that the workshop 'OEM part' is better suited to the bike than the fancy-boxed, priced and with manual rear mech that is in the showroom. It should also be significantly cheaper. To make your task easier you may also want to pickup a fresh inner cable with end-cap so that the end of the cable does not get frayed. Again the LBS may sell you an un-boxed cable from the workshop supplies for less money than the packaged cable in the showroom. Ground clearance is a big consideration with smaller wheeled 'youth' mountain bikes. Do not buy the long-arm mech if the medium length mech will suffice.
