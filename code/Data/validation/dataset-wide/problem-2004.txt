What I learned about interviews is that you try to sell yourself to the company. To hire someone is a huge risk, as it's not just your paycheck that is a cost attached to you, but also thing like equipment, traveling (if the jobs requires that), training and all that. If they hire the wrong person, they can end up paying for someone who either does not know what they are doing, or simply don't do anything at all. As mentioned, it is an advantage for you, provided you use it. If they reveal something about what they do or need, and you fit it, shoot that info in. "Yes, I can do that! I can fill that role!". But also prove you actually can. If you claim to be good with computers, but actually just know how to surf facebook, you are worth nothing. But, if you say you do your own maintenance, have knowledge regarding many common software solutions and so on, you are suddenly at a greater state. Of course, do not lie or push the boundaries. Be careful tho, it could be a trick. If you just sit there and barely say anything, it might just show them that you are nothing but a bobhead figure that just want to get things over with. Those who hold the interview are the costumers, you are the salesman, trying to convince them why YOUR wares are the best ones. 

My boss, for the entire company's workflow, uses Google Sheets as a sort of feature-tracker/TODO-list. The company employs 7 people, aside from the CEO (my boss), who all work remotely. There are 2 software developers (myself included), 2 linguists, 2 marketing personnel and the CEO's son. I did once suggest to my boss that we at least move to a tool like Trello that functions similarly, but with much more flexibility. This was when he said that Trello would be a new tool that everyone has to learn, and he doesn't want to do that as everyone is already used to the "Google Sheet flow", and that it would be difficult for everyone to migrate. The problem is that if things are pushed into the backlog, as in "not important enough for this next release/campaign", they are often forgotten about. We will continue to add things to fix/add at the top of the list, and things that were low priority before become essentially non-existent. It's also hard to tell why we backlogged something because of the limited flexibility of Google Sheets, and having progress tracking is out the window. Here's an example from my Sheet (feature tracker) for a high-priority Android app fix that got mixed in with other work: 

If your wife is unemployed, meaning that you have a need for her to get a job, you might consider asking your direct boss, or the person responsible for the new customer service hire, depending on the size of the company, and how familiar you are with people around. 

The fact that it is a scolarship does not change the equation. And generally, it is recommended not to tell anything at your working place until you get something clear (job offer, contract... or scolarship acceptance). Your work probably includes a trial time (typically a few months) which is also for such cases. So for the time being, no need to tell them anything. But as soon as you get a positive confirmation (possibly in paper form), do tell them as soon as possible. You might want to check your contract to see how long you have to work when resigning. It's usually different during the trial, but both should be in your contract. 

For the first option: do you really want to stay in a company, where you feel you've been cheated? And forcing your way to stay is probably not going to improve your image within the company. Plus they will probably use any opportunity to make you leave. The second, might feel tempting. But that's called burning bridges. It means that any further professional relationship with anyone involved (company, people), would be awkward at best. Plus you should also consider that these people know other people. You might get some satisfaction, but you certainly won't save your professional image. The third option is probably the most accepted one. You take the loss gracefully. And accept that you misunderstood something. In the future you'll make sure to always know where you stand. If, as you say, it's due to a personality difference with a single person, acting in a professional manner, would open various possibilities. One of them, being the reference provided by your boss. As for the question whether it is legal, do check with a lawyer. 

This sheet is now about 75 lines long for the next version release of the app, with some duplicated information and no visual organization except "what's on top is most important". I've been testing out some free workflow/task management tools for the past few hours (on my own time) and I am convinced that it would be beneficial for all the employees of the company to use such tools. What benefits about employees and management can I use to convince him that it's actually a good idea? I've come up with the following: 

Aside: You mention that you want to be able to gauge a candidate's ability to write code, assess its quality an cleanliness, etc., right? Well, have them do some simple programming task that requires a bit more thought that the typical FizzBuzz questions (which are designed to weed out non-programmers, or incompetent programmers). Personally, I would aim for a question about describing a real world system in code, and not some complex algorithmic "mathy" question, but of course what you ask is dependent on your industry. 

Easy, if your old job is similar to the new one, and maybe even close in a geographical setting, your previous boss and potential new boss MAY know each other. Slim chance, but it's a trap you DON'T want to step in. Besides, you'd want some papers from your old boss, to show your new, and likely they will end up talking on phone regarding you. Lastly, as mentioned, you don't want to seem like the asshole. Not like your new boss can know if your old boss actually was a douche, or it was you who were the douche all along. In short: If you badmouth your previous boss, you only badmouth yourself. 

Working within IT, where sub departments work with different tasks, I can relate to this completely, and the answer I've got for you is this: Be honest, and provide all the information you can. There is no real way to avoid pissing of some people, there will always be those who just won't accept any answer not equal to what they wanted, and there is always those who try to play you by making you feel guilty or stupid. As long as you keep your cool and provide all the information you can in an honest way, you are doing your part. There is no shame sending them to other people you think can answer a subject better, that's how work synergy should be. Your job is primarily to send them in the right direction, a little detour here and there is bound to happen at times, so never feel bad for that. 

So you would consider something possibly illegal to retaliate for a situation that you misunderstood... That's probably going to come off worse on your professional image than having misunderstood the situation. Being fired isn't an easy thing, and working to the end of it, isn't much better. You might want to read your contract and all written documents (the only ones that count) to get a better grasp of the situation. Yet you have only few options: 

Talk to your boss. Your boss can only manage when he gets the info. For whatever reason, he might not have realised the increase of workload, and the weariness you have. It's perfectly ok to tell them. If you don't want to be too abrupt about it, start by asking what are the perspective for the new hire. And if you don't want to appear as complaining, don't complain, simply keep to the fact: you have a lot of work for you to handle and you're not sure you'll make it. If you're really overloaded, your boss might prioritize things, or find other resources to, temporarily, take part of it off your shoulder. If you wait until the last moment, and don't make it, it would be much worse and take out any chance for your boss to think about an alternative solution.
