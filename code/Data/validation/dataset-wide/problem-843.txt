I won't go into detail to precisely explain the spectroscopic interpretation of the above quote, but suffice it to say, that is their method of detecting matter infalling towards the core of the high mass star. 

We've dropped the height by three orders of magnitude compared to the no atmosphere model! Conclusion While the physics model is basic, I don't think it is unrealistic. I'm sure with more investigation, more accurate numbers and models could be used, but I believe the results would be more or less the same. On Earth, it is not gravity which primarily limits the height of our geysers, it the strong atmosphere drag. If I run this simulation on Earth, I find a similar water droplet would reach a height of $40\:m$ in our atmosphere, but without that atmosphere, it would get up to $13\:km$, more than 300 times higher. The reason these geysers can reach such large heights is primarily because of the lack of atmosphere drag, compared to what we see on Earth. The weaker gravity does help in the geysers reaching higher heights, but to a lesser extent. 

Light curves extracted from all single pixels within the quarter 4, 5 and 6 Target Pixel Files for KIC 9603833 (the symbiotic star StHA 169). Gray pixels comprise the optimal apertures that yield the archived light curves. The target point-spread function is distributed across neighboring pixels differently from quarter to quarter and hence the optimal aperture varies in size and shape from quarter to quarter. Flat line between days 1581 to 1587 I'm less certain about this one. I believe the flat line is just missing data. To keep the line continuous, they just connected the data points they had with a straight line. Why the data is missing, I can't be sure. I know that Quarter 17 ended with the failure of Kepler's second reaction wheel so my guess is that this missing data is in some way related to these reaction wheel troubles. I do know they tried,in the past, to put the spacecraft in 10-day "wheel rest" mode in hopes that it would give the reaction wheels a break, let them get lubed up again, and be better when they restarted. Perhaps, by this stage, they had already suspected a second reaction wheel problem and were trying out a wheel rest mode. I can't find any evidence a wheel rest occurred during Quarter 17 though, so this is just my guess. 

Microlensing - This uses the concept of gravitational mass acting as a lens to background, luminous objects by bending spacetime, and consequently, the path of light through space. If a planet passes in front of a background object (not its host star), it will cause a slight magnification of that background object. I should say that this requires a chance alignment and so it is not a repeatable measurement, meaning there is often little chance that we can actually confirm that we saw a planet. Below is a light curve of a background object and you can see it grow brighter as the main star passes in front of the background object. Pay attention to the little blip on the right which indicates the planet also passes in front of the background object. 

The tidal force of 1c on 1b is defined as the differential force of gravity across 1b, that is, the difference of the force of gravity on the side of 1b facing towards 1c and the force of gravity on the side of 1b facing away from 1c. Mathematically, we get. $$F_{tide,c-b} = F_{g,-R_b} - F_{g,+R_b} = \frac{GM_bM_c}{(D-R_b)^2} - \frac{GM_bM_c}{(D+R_b)^2} = 4GM_bM_c\frac{DR_b}{(D^2-R_b^2)^2}$$ We can presume that $R_b << D$ (for this case $R_b/D = 1\%$) and reduce this to $$F_{tide,c-b}(D) \approx 4GM_bM_c\frac{R_b}{D^3}$$ But this isn't enough to determine the amount of tidal heating that may occur. Tidal heating only occurs when the tidal force changes. It is this constantly changing tidal force which results in tidal flexing of the planet and thus creating heat through tidal friction. Fortunately, for these two planets, the tidal force will be changing since $D$ will be constantly changing. So let's calculate $F_{tide}$ for the two extremes where these planets are as close as possible and as far as possible and difference them. $$\Delta F_{tide,c-b} = F_{tide}(0.004\:\mathrm{AU}) - F_{tide}(0.026\:\mathrm{AU})$$ If I plug in numbers to this, I find that $$\Delta F_{tide,c-b} \approx 3.7\times10^{20}\:\mathrm{N}$$ Okay, but what do we do with this number? It's somehow a metric of the change in tidal forcing that 1c imparts on 1b, but is it negligible? To determine this, we have to compare it to something. Let's compare this to the tidal forcing that TRAPPIST-1b would receive from the star. Calculating tidal forces from TRAPPIST-1 on TRAPPIST-1b I've already set up the math, so we don't need to go over that again. But first, let me discuss where this tidal forcing is actually coming from. Quoting an article from space.com, the paper's author, Gillon, states: 

The Galactic Coordinate system is a longitude-latitude coordinate system that is used to define the positions of objects in space, most commonly objects within our own galaxy. It uses the center of our galaxy as the focal point (i.e., where we consider $(0^{\circ},\:0^{\circ})$), much like we use the position just off Africa as the focal point of the Earth's lon-lat system. You can see a visual representation of this system below. 

Just to provide an official answer, the radius $r$ in that equation is formally the distance between the center of masses between the two objects. That does come with some assumptions of course, but for most standard physics problems that concept is perfectly fine. As you stated, the equation does not assume anything about air resistance, and to extend that, it does not assume anything about continued propulsion. If you're at some radius $r$ from the center of the Earth and you have some velocity $v>v_e$, then just coasting along in your trajectory will allow you to eventually escape the Earth's gravitational pull (ignoring the obvious case where you intersect the Earth with your trajectory). 

Who's to say there aren't other bumps or deviations at radii that we can't observationally confirm. Our confidence in any power law's applicability for small asteroids and comets basically comes from modelling. This power law you're asking about is essentially something referred to as an "Initial Mass Function" (IMF). A lot of work has been done to define an IMF for stars, relating the mass of stars to the number of stars at that mass. This stellar IMF follows a power law more or less, but strongly deviates for very low masses. At the surface, it would be reasonable to assume an IMF for asteroids and comets likewise deviates. The way you answer this, is through models. See for example Cuzzi, Hogan, and Bottke (2010) (that link is to the formal journal paper, but for some reason some plots are obscured so you can also look at their "unofficial" arxiv version). In this paper, the authors attempt to construct a representative asteroid/comet population by modeling their formation via accretion of protoplanetary dust grains into asteroids, comets, KBO, and planetesimals. They make certain assumptions about the initial gas disk around the Sun and bake in physics of how these dust grains formed into larger conglomerates. Their end goal is to produce an IMF that identifies how many asteroids/comets exist at a given size. They back up a lot of their modelling with data from observations so they stick to reality as much as possible. I'll let you peruse their results since they actually produce many different IMFs using a variety of different assumptions and starting conditions. However, I think one can summarize their results in a way which addresses your main question. As they state it: 

This equation may seem scary, but effectively it is telling you is how the size of the universe, has evolved over time based on the current content of the universe. If you know precisely how much matter, radiation, and dark energy you have in the universe right now (or more precisely the density), you can calculate the history of the universe! 1Technically there is more than one equation, but we'll look at an important form of one of them. The Age of the Universe Remember, $a$ is a function of time in the equation above. This means, with a little bit of rearranging and integrating, we can calculate the age of the universe. $$t=\frac{1}{H_0} \int_{0}^{1} \Big(\Omega_{m,0}a^{-1} + \Omega_{r,0}a^{-2} + \Omega_{\Lambda,0}a^2 + \Omega_{k,0}\Big)^{-1/2} da$$ To calculate the age of the universe, $t$, you have the non-trivial task of measuring good values for the constants and then doing the integral above. As a trivial case, you can assume we live in a flat, matter-only universe - no light, no dark energy, no curvature. In that case $\Omega_{m,0}=1$ and $\Omega_{r,0}=\Omega_{\Lambda,0}=\Omega_{k,0}=0$. You'll wind up with $t=2/(3H_0)$ which amounts to ~10 billion years old. This type of universe is known as an Einstein-de Sitter Universe and is obviously not the universe we live in. A Note on Dark Energy Technically the equations above are a bit more complicated because I haven't accounted for dark energy. I won't go into the specifics, but one can choose to add components to the equation above which include the dark energy equation of state parameter. Generally this parameter is denoted by $w$. The concepts are more or less the same, the equations just become uglier. Conclusion With all of the above, I think I can really address your question. 

This is a complicated question that would really require a full physics simulation and better knowledge of the system to accurately answer. But let's try a few back of the envelope calculations to see what we get. Calculating tidal forces from TRAPPIST-1c on TRAPPIST-1b I'm going to calculate the tidal effects of TRAPPIST-1c on TRAPPIST-1b (simply because, a priori, this seems likely to be where the strongest tidal heating will be induced). See the figure below which describes the parameters. 

Those two ideas don't relate at all. There's nothing suggesting the speed of light slowing down implies everything shrinks. 

The best way to do this is to pick a particular astronomical instrument or science mission and go to their website. Almost all astronomy projects are required to release their data to the public and they almost always link to their data from the website for that mission/instrument. For example, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey which produces spectra for a huge number of stars has access to their spectra right here. You can download the fits files directly and start playing around with the actual data yourself. 

From looking at the E-ELT website, it appears that at first light, the AO will only work for near-IR. Specifically, the instrument that can use AO is the MICADO instrument. The description page for this instrument states 

Lada 2006 - This paper is more or less a conglomeration of past research on the fraction of stars which are single star systems. It focused on lower mass stars (G to M) and found that the fraction of single star systems ranged from ~43% for G type stars to ~75% for M type stars (which are the most populous type). Eggleton & Tokovinin 2008 - I think that this is the best source for your particular question. Within their abstract they state This implies the fraction of multiplicities is: 59.62%, 31.52%, 6.25%, 1.88%, 0.44%, 0.24%, and 0.04%. However, note they say their measurements have "substantial" uncertainties which they describe. Guerrero et al. 2014 - This group looked at and around a specific cluster and found within the cluster itself. Including stars around the cluster, the following multiplicities were found (ranging from 1 to 8 companions) These two sets of ratios indicate that within the cluster they saw 79% single star systems and 21% binary star systems. Overall they saw multiplicity fractions of 79.1%, 17.1%, 2.5%, 0.6%, 0%, 0%, 0%, and 0.6%, respectively. Lafrenière et al. 2014 - A study that looked at 91 stars and found 57 single stars (63%), 29 binaries (32%), and 5 triple systems (5.5%).
