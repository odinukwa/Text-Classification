It's an approximation based on some formulas. It assumes muscle/fat based off of simple BMI calculations (which is not always typical), and depending on the speed/intensity predicts what an average person at your body weight would be burning based. More advanced formulas that you'll find in your heart rate monitors take into consideration your heart rate to fine tune the intensity. It still considers what you tell it your weight is. All that said, it is a useful approximation to judge the relative effectiveness of an exercise for burning calories. 

I echo Dave Liepmann's video recommendation. It's very informative. As far as what I can see here, we've got a couple things going on: 

When you increase your strength training, you have more demands on recovery. Recovery includes the following: 

I'm not sure about 10kg in one month, but I know of one person who added 11kg in 8 weeks. It was the Gallon of Milk a Day (GOMAD) diet, where in addition to your normal food, you have 1 US Gallon of whole milk a day. Split it up between meals of course. In addition to the milk, you need to do some strength training which will trigger your body to use most of that milk for your muscles. Now, Nick (the guy who gained 11kg in 8 weeks) dealt with lactose intolerance, and I think his review of the experience is a fairly balanced view of things. Bottom line: your goals are very ambitious. While it provides you with something to shoot for, you may have to be OK with a slower pace. If you have a naturally high metabolism, you will have to eat so much food you will get sick and tired of eating. 

The max you lift in any given exercise is the process of demonstrating strength. It is just one way to measure strength, but it is one that is universally accepted. However, there are several factors that go into that one number: 

A lot of it has to do with your programming. If you are training for 3-4 hours a day, 5 days a week, you have a great potential to do too much. Here's the deal: 

You want to have enough protein to protect your muscles. This is more important than carbs and fat. To find out how much protein you need, you can use the calculator over here. While it's more accurate to use your lean body mass, it won't hurt you to calculate based on your overall body weight--you might even increase your muscle mass that way. 

There are upper body movements that involve the biceps, but none that isolate them specifically like you can with dumbbells or machines. Examples include: 

you would grab it by one of the weighted ends, but don't let your thumb or fingers use the lettering as a grip. If you can hold the weight for 2 minutes straight, increase the weight. If not, keep at that weight. 

If you were to take Michael Phelps and keep feeding him that diet while not allowing him to train, he would become as big as a house. As long as he trains as hard as he does, he can eat like he does. Extreme athletes like Phelps also work with coaches and get regular physicals to ensure they can keep working at optimum performance. 

There are several arguments about correct bar placement. The two main locations are "high bar" and "low bar". Both pictures you have portray a high bar placement. The trapezius isn't designed for massive loads; however, if you have the bar a couple inches lower so that the load is split across the mid scapula. 

This answer is a complement to Meade Rhubenstein's which covered the dumbbell very well. Your question also included the barbell. There are two main types of barbells: 

Based on that article, I cut my caffeine down to one 16 oz of coffee per day. I find that I'm plenty stimulated by that one cup now, where before I would need several cups throughout the day. When I get within a month competition I'll drop even that amount of coffee and not have any until the day of competition. The combination of Bulletproof Coffee and Green Tea I couldn't find any stats on how much caffeine was in the Bulletproof Upgraded coffee, but I did find some general stats on coffee and tea. 

Just keep training the way you are training. There's no need for the symmetry between each set. Only resort to cheat reps when there is a specific training reason to do it. If you can't come up with it, then just work on increasing the total number of reps over time. 

The first thing that separates extreme athletes from most of the rest of us is the amount of energy they require. It's true that when you need to consume 12,000 Calories to keep up with your training, you simply can't eat clean. It's easy to make up all the protein the body needs within that amount of Calories, so these athletes can eat pretty much whatever they want and still be lean and healthy. There are a few things that we need to realize about food that may not be immediately obvious: 

I believe this is particularly true if you know you are not in good physical health or are at aa high risk for coronary disease. That said, you can get conditioned, as long as you do it a little at a time. If you talk with your doctor, and they have concerns with the HIIT protocol ask for suggestions of how to work up to it--or what to look for when your body can't handle it any more. If you start light and progressively increase, it gives your cardiovascular system time to beef up and get ready for the real HIIT training. 

The article is written by the founders of Examine.com, which independently reviews research about a number of supplements. It is consequently well researched and fairly easy to understand. In the section on protein timing, they made a couple very good points: 

In the long run, you'll want a bench that isn't so rigid. In fact a good squat stand with 1" hole spacing in the bench range is a very good option. The quick answer is find someone to give you a lift-off, but as you mentioned, this just isn't practical at the moment. The way StrongLifts is set up, you deal with stalls in the following manner: 

The first option will help get your grip stronger pretty well. There does come a time when the weight on the bar increases faster than your grip strength, though. This is where we come to the second option. There are three main types of grip for deadlifts, in order of strength: 

See Superficial Muscles of the Human Body for more examples. Superficial muscles are the most visible, so body builders will spend time to make sure they look right. However, the deep muscles and intermediate muscles add to the overall mass of a person, as well as improving their ability to lift heavy things. All strength athletes (from body builders to Olympic weightlifters and power lifters) spend time developing the muscles you cannot see. Compound lifts are an important component of this process. 

All this is from the first four pages. There are more effects. Now, does that mean you have to go cold turkey and not have another drink as long as you live? Maybe not. However, it might be a good idea to limit it to once a week. 

You'll find that supplements on a mass gaining diet may not really be necessary, other than multivitamins and omega-3s. You will do better eating your carbs from rice and potatoes than you will from a tub of mass gainer. If you have a hard time gaining mass, Jordan Syatt had a good article covering the typical issues "hard gainers" have: 

To me, it sounds like you also need to be working on your upper thoracic mobility. This should also help with the hyperlordosis as the two areas are connected. Between them both, you can really correct your posture. When you warm up, also make sure your shoulders are properly warmed up as well. A couple warmup routines include (just pick one to use): 

In general, your body will maintain its muscle mass with .5g of protein per pound lean body weight (i.e. how much you weigh without fat). Muscle tone and strength might change, but you will be able to protect the muscle you have. To gain muscle mass, increase the protein to 1g of protein per pound lean body weight. Someone that is 250lbs on the scale but only has 165lbs muscle mass will need the same amount of protein as someone who is 215lbs on the scale but has 165lbs of muscle mass. In both cases, you would consume 83g of protein to maintain or 165g of protein to gain muscle (not fat). That said, you will probably lose some muscle tone. I can't say anything about whether you can lose strength while maintaining mass, but I'm pretty sure its possible. In the interim, you you might be able to do a light treadmill workout while your shoulder is healing. You'd want to stay away from anything that will shock your shoulder, so no running. However, a good walk keeping your heart rate in the fat burning zone will help burn a bit extra fat while you are recovering. As to resources, check out: 

Sleep Study A sleep study is when you go to a controlled center and they hook up all kinds of sensors to you. The sensors monitor brain activity, muscle twitching, breathing, heart rate, etc. You sleep at the center and they record what the sensors give them. If you are diagnosed with sleep apnea, you will likely get a second session to figure out how much air pressure you need for a CPAP machine. Sleeping with a CPAP machine It takes some getting used to the air constantly blowing into your nose while you are sleeping, but it doesn't take too long. When you wake up in the morning you will be refreshed for the first time in a really long time. The hope is of course that as you continue to use the CPAP machine you will eventually no longer need it. Unhelpful Doctors The first treatment most doctors attempt is to order sleeping pills. If you are sleeping alone in bed you don't have someone to tell you if you snore incessantly or if your breathing stops at all. You won't have that information to give to your doctor. Ask them to order you a sleep study to rule out anything else because the pills are not working. You will know definitively whether you have sleep apnea, or some other ailment that is affecting your sleep quality. You need to emphasize the fact that the pills don't help, the doctor should start looking at other symptoms at that point. If not, seek a second opinion or go to a sleep specialist. 

Dumbbells, Kettlebells, and Barbells all have many more advantages over something like the shake weight. They also help produce usable strength. Body weight exercises also do the same, and you simply manipulate leverages to produce more strength. 

There's always the chance that you have something more going on with your body like an inflamed gall bladder, insufficient iodine in the diet to support proper thyroid function, etc. However, the three bullets address the top contenders for why you aren't losing weight and/or inches. Figuring out Exercise Muscle soreness really is a poor indicator of how hard you are working. All it means is that you did something your body isn't used to. I find that after a layoff my body can get very sore from even a light workout. I'm just starting back in the gym after a surgery, and even though the weights I'm using are very light for me I'm incredibly sore. Once I'm back in the swing of things, I can be using twice the weight I am now with the same number of reps and not feel sore at all. That said, there's some ways to ensure you are hitting your goals: 

Each 5x5 (or 3x5) program has its own protocol for when you start stalling like you are doing. One of the more common ones, StrongLifts 5x5, suggests the following protocol for when you stall: 

Take a look at this article on Alcohol and Nutrition Facts. It's pretty long, so I'll try to summarize the high points. 

Get your nutrition back on track, rest up while doing it. You should be ready to get back to the volume and intensity you were training at before. It's a normal cycle for getting stronger: 

More info about the energy (measured in Calories or kcal). Understand first that not all calories are created equal. The body needs the following to function properly: 

So, if economy is what you need--either space or overall cost--adjustable dumbbells may be the way to go. They are more cumbersome to use when you have to change weights during your routine, but that can be offset by getting enough handles/weights to support that. However, non-adjustable dumbbells are the most solidly built and the easiest to use. There's no moving parts. They just take up a lot of space, and a whole set will be very expensive. Between the adjustable dumbbells, the pros and cons are more varied: 

Your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) is a measure of how much your body burns at rest. Another way to think of it is your base metabolic rate. A note of caution about the BMR calculators: they will only give you an average estimate. It's OK to use if you are sedentary with average muscle mass, but if you have been inactive for a long time and have a protein deficient diet it will estimate high. On the other hand if you are very active and have higher than average muscle mass the calculator will estimate low. The best way to know for sure is to be tested (which can be done at most gyms or your doctor's office). How much an exercise burns is also a factor of your VO2 and heart rate at the moment. In general the higher the heart rate the more sugar you burn while the lower your heart rate the more fat you burn. Your calories burned reported by your treadmills and such are based on people with average muscle mass and cardiovascular health. Your actual values may be slightly higher or lower. For fun you can use a calculator like this one which uses your weight to figure out the calories burned. While not completely accurate, you will get close enough to plan your dietary needs. 5-7 pounds really isn't that much. In fact your body can fluctuate that much weight easily based on water retention, how much food is still in your stomach undigested, and whether you are constipated or not. Drinking lots of water will help with excess water retention, and cutting the salt intake down will also help in that area (you need some salt, but probably not as much as you are consuming now). Food digests when it digests, but many times people freak out after a large meal and swear they've gained 2-3 pounds. If gaining one pound of fat is 3500 calories, to gain 2 pounds of fat you need to eat 7000 calories more than your BMR--most people can't eat that much if they tried. It's probably the combination of the items listed above. If you cut the carbs to only breakfast and/or dinner (none at lunch or a night snack) you'll probably shed those pounds pretty quickly. That's without calorie counting. For me, walking 4 mph burns about 411 calories per hour. If you walked at the same pace daily for one hour without changing your diet at all, you would be able to lose a pound every 8.5 days. Adjusting the diet will make that quicker.
