Fictional worlds, usually ones set in the future, often depict planets with a single worldwide government. (In fact, it's such a common trope that one Babylon 5 episode made a point of saying "hey, Earth isn't like all you other guys" in that way.) Living here on Earth, I have trouble seeing how we could end up with such here -- sure we have the UN and regional associations like the EU and NATO, and countries make treaties, but no state seems willing to give up its sovereignty entirely -- states reserve the right to not enter such agreements or even to break treaties, and consequences are limited unless the state is doing something Really Bad. If I want my world to have a global government that has real authority, should I be thinking of it in terms of having taken a very different path from Earth (e.g. a world conquerer), or is there some sequence of events that could bring diverse sovereign states together into a single world government? What conditions would have to be met in order for a world government to take hold, and stick? Can you get to a world government through paths other than worldwide military conquest? 

Your turn signal lets cars around you know what you're about to do in good time to slow down or take other basic evasive action. At normal speeds, when you have traction against the ground, and a reasonable means of stopping. There's a saying with hovercraft, that if you can see something in front of you, you're going to hit it. No traction, minimal brakes. What all this means to a ship in space at interplanetary or even orbital speeds, is that if you're in a situation where you can both see and need to respond to a turn signal, it's already far far too late. At least nobody will hear you scream. 

You could even give them different ways of interacting with the same information. Seeing infrared is an easily understood example, we can feel heat, but if you can see into infrared then you can "see" heat. As my father used to say: 

A tangential note: Judaism and Christianity are quite different in focus and themes, despite the latter starting from a version of the former. You'll probably do better to stop thinking of "Judaism/Christianity" as a single thing. In particular, Christianity doesn't have as much focus on land even now as Judaism does, and that might be hindering your thinking. Also, there's a third Avrahamic religion, which I haven't touched on in this answer. 

Do you know how much work it is to be a god? You get to the office in the morning, learn that your demigod assistant still hasn't learned that it's double espresso, one sugar, darn it, and face the overflowing pile of petitions from worshippers. Meanwhile, two of your fellow gods have been nagging you for weeks about reviewing a design for that new creature they want to set loose in the brush, and one of them is still fighting with one of the goddesses over that incident with the rapid-growth plants that weren't supposed to be an impenetrable jungle, and good heavens is it not even 9:00 yet? Ugh, going to be a long day. Beings that don't need to keep working and don't derive pleasure from it retire. Your old gods have been at this for, what, millennia? Eons? Even if it's only centuries, are they perhaps getting a little tired of it all, or bored? Being gods, they don't need to remain actively involved; doesn't this sound like a great time for a vacation -- or, if you prefer, science experiment, to see how their creation functions without them? By 9:30 the inbox is no smaller but the travel plans have been made. The inhabitants of the world, maybe overseen by some of the lesser divine beings, can run things for a while. The gods and their heavenly court are off to do something relaxing, exciting, or different. Except your coffee-challenged demigod; he's not allowed to come until he learns how not to mess up drink orders. 

Given the requirement to view the entire Earth once in a 24 hours period I can see only two solutions. You can either gain 15 degrees (1 hour) per hour on the rotation of the planet, or lose 15 degrees per hour. The former requires you to effectively (and exactly) "lap" the planet in a single day of its rotation, meaning you need to move precisely twice as fast. This puts you into a 12 hour orbit around the planet, meaning you make 2 orbits for the Earth's single rotation allowing you to see each point on the Earth by seeing 12 hours (180 degrees) of it on each orbit. Orbital distance 20,200km (approx). This allows the "near Earth" requirement and is the stable, safe option. The latter forces you into a solar orbit as you have no effective movement relative to the Earth1. You can't just share an orbit though, you need to sit in one of the gravity neutral locations or you'll end up hitting the planet you're sharing orbit with. These safe locations are known as Lagrange points and are numbered L1 through L5 based on location, seen in the image below outlined by gravitational contours. 

In my future setting on Earth (or an Earth-like planet; haven't decided), the fields of robotics and AI have taken off and we have intelligent, ambulatory robots. (They were initially thought of as machines, but, as is common in such settings, they have advanced and they are considered "human-equivalent" by many, with the courts slowly catching up.) My question is about power. I want my robots to be able to move freely around the world (no tethers). It seems like my options are either batteries (plug yourself in each night to recharge) or something passive that keeps enough juice coming in. For the battery option, how much battery are we talking about? Imagine a human-sized, human-shaped robot that is capable of movement, fine motor control, and "thought"; how big and heavy would a battery to support that for, say, 24 hours need to be? Can I physically fit that somewhere on-board? For the passive-energy option, do I have options other than solar (which would still require a smaller battery for night/indoors)? If I covered the robot's exterior with the best solar panels that we might be able to build in the next 200 years, would that be anywhere close to what I need? Is there some other way to achieve that end? How do I realistically power my robots? I am looking for answers that are technically feasible within a couple hundred years; I'm not interested in alien technology or magic. 

You don't want to puncture your own hull You probably want to capture the enemy ship intact You may be fighting in a vacuum Spacesuits are easy to puncture Firearms are often useless in tight spaces Any discharge of a projectile or explosive weapon may damage critical ship systems 

For the second part of your question, it depends on the permanence of the settlement. "Just about anything" is the short answer, small tribes in low population density pick up and move on easily but famine would be the most common city killer. 

It's been too many years since I tried to do a calculation like this so I can't fulfill the requirements of the "hard-science" tag but you'll need to compare it to ship design. For your city to be stable: The centre of mass has to lie below the centre of buoyancy. Now of course there's no such thing as a centre of buoyancy in a falling object but there will be a calculated centre of aerodynamic resistance defined as the point in the structure where you could say "air resistance applies here in this direction" which could be used as an equivalent. (I didn't do anything much with turbulent flows so don't bite my head off if this ceases to be valid outside laminar flow) I my head this requires your city to look something like a more flared golf tee, point downwards with most of the mass in the stem and the population living on top, trailing behind like a parachute over a weight. 

We know that something similar happens in mammals; a mother who is infected, or drug-addicted, can transmit that condition to her fetus. So, what we need is a way for a jellyfish-borne virus to affect a pregnant cat. 

I'm not a frog-person with disproportionately strong legs, nor do I know any in real life, but let me offer some analysis based on many years of experience in medieval-style combat, both individual and melee fights. The shield: You're describing a shield that, in combat posture, covers most of the frog-man's body. This provides good defensive coverage from the front and can be used to intercept blows coming from front and up. It will be harder to move into a position to protect from range weapons, but effective when it can be used (large area). I haven't done a load-bearing analysis of shield-sized rafts, so I am assuming a shield that's reasonably sturdy, probably metal-rimmed for extra protection. The spear: I'm assuming you're describing a one-handed weapon here because of what you said about the shield. It's possible to use a spear two-handed while also using a shield, but usually (in my experience) this is effective only with smaller shields, not the larger ones you've described. A one-handed spear is good at thrusting but probably not slashing. Thrusting requires more strength than slashing (as with a sword) to do comparable damage, and may be more hindered by better armor. You might consider adding swords to your frog-men's equipment list. Spears are quite effective when being charged, particularly in combination with those large shields you've described. When your frog-men fight in groups they should form a shield wall, brace against charges, and maintain formation. In the shield-wall formation they might choose to have second-rank fighters forgo their shields in order to use their spears two-handed (for much-more-effective blows). Sword and shield in the front rank and spear in the second rank is an effective combination. Posture: Being shorter than one's opponent is often a disadvantage, especially if the taller opponent also has longer reach (as when shorter and taller people fight each other; the taller ones tend to have longer arms). But your frog-men have an important advantage: strong jumps. This suggests a tactic where they lurk out of opponents' weapon range waiting for an opening, then jump, strike, and fall back. I would expect this to be comparable in many ways to modern fencing bouts; viewing such bouts might give you ideas. Upper body strength is important in melee fighting, but strength does not come only from the upper body. The best fighters I know (and granted, we're talking re-creation here with wooden weapons, not live steel, and people are not actually trying to kill each other) start pushing a blow from the back foot, through the legs and hips, and into the upper body until it becomes a powerful weapon blow. (This is hard to describe in words, sorry.) My point here is that your frog-men, being particularly strong in the legs, probably have the element of surprise the first time they strike; nobody's going to be expecting that much power from such a little guy. They should aim for tactics where they can use that surprise. Because they can walk upright, they have the ability to trade shield coverage for height advantage on an as-needed basis. Human fighters sometimes try to maintain a crouch for protection too, but we can't do it for extended periods because we're not built for that. Having the ability to choose as conditions dictate should be very powerful. Aerial attacks: Because of those strong legs they can leap -- you said about 4m up. This gives them the ability to leap and strike while dropping back to the ground. I'll leave it to the physicists to compute how powerful their strike would be -- I would expect this could deliver a pretty solid blow, what with gravity on their side like that. However, unless the low-level magic in your world includes flight, once a frog-man is airborne he has limited control over where he goes. Opponents nimble enough to dodge the blow -- or trip him up as he lands -- will be a real danger. Aerial attacks from surprise, on the other hand, can be very effective; if they can ambush their opponents from cover (or even from lower tree branches!) that first blow is likely to be doozy. 

This is only a quick summary of basic questions to consider, there are far more in the real world. At the end of this line of questioning you get a couple of numbers that tell you how much work you need to do and where. 

Steel frames, glass or ceramic cladding and a prefabricated composite sandwich for the floors replacing the current prefab concrete. Not a vast difference from how most city towers are built currently, but quite heavy on industrial base, so not for initial colonisation but rather for a mature colony. Tower foundations are currently built with poured concrete, but if you stick to low rise until suitable levels of biological matter have built up, guano for example, then deep foundations are less of a critical factor. You won't need high rise until you've built up a large population anyway. Initial colonisation will probably be done with corrugated iron huts and other prefab facilities. 

Churches are centers for their religious communities. They need to be accessible; if the people can't go, the churches can't function. Sure, religions also have isolated communities (think monasteries), but those are inward-facing. Your churches, to be successful, need to be outward- (populace-) facing. Successful churches, therefore, will be built where the people are, in the midst of where they live. Some religions' leaders will happily help this along; accessible churches mean the church has access to the people, too. And if no space for religious congregation was built into the original plans, that doesn't mean people need to go to space. Instead, they'll make space. 

"Would you like some candy, little girl?" Satan wants to encourage dependency and entitlement from a child's earliest moments of sentience. He can build on this through the elementary-school years, encouraging a demand for things things things, and now, dammit. He wants those kids to grow up thinking the world owes them, but he has to start with one fat guy in a red suit owing them. Just as candy from strangers is the first step to drugs and gangs, toys from strangers is the first step to teen years filled with petty crime to support one's online-gaming habits (the Warcraft mods on eBay are so attractive, and really not that expensive all things considered!). How does this serve his purposes, you might ask? When he gets lucky he'll create the next wave of teenage thugs and criminals, but the real payoff is with the ones who stick with school, go to college, and end up on Wall Street. Satan is hoping to draw everybody with a tendency toward greed, materialism, and the desire to play with other people's life savings to one place, where he can hang out with people who understand their priorities in life. Sure, he figures he'll get them later in another place, but you can't beat the night life in New York City and Satan gets lonely down in the firepits.
