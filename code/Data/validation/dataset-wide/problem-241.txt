I'll go for a pessimistic-realistic view: Limit the language families your translator can work at. Here's an example: English, French, Spanish, Danish and 440 other languages are known as the Indo-European language family. They are grouped this way because they use a similar alphabet, similar means of conveying an idea, and share many cognates with each other. When translating in between these languages, you might have to swap a few phrases around, use a different dictionary, but they are otherwise the same. People with a natural tongue in this language are more likely to learn a second language in this category, like Spanish and Dutch. Languages outside this family, however, like many Asian languages, use a different approach. They have a completely different system of letters. Instead of using characters to convey how to pronounce the word, they use it to convey the meaning of the word. Translating between these families would be much tougher than intra-family translation. Therefore, you could make a translator that only works in one family. Decrease the Accuracy of the Translator. Go to Google Translate. Translate "How many pigs does a dog eat?" to Hebrew. Copy the words, and translate it back to English. At the time of this answer (2016-12-06), I got back, "Some pigs do not eat dog?" Translators are known today to be inaccurate. Many foreign exchange students in my high school are known to use Google Translate to convert their native language to English, and I hear the teacher talking to them every other week. Translators aren't perfect, and converting possibly extra-terrestrial languages would be with 100% accuracy is neigh-impossible. Have your device read the conscious of the Translator. This has a few requirements: 

This seems to be untrue. According to the United States National Ocean Service, the average depth of the oceans is approximately 12,100 feet or 2.3 miles or 3.7 kilometers. Oceans cover about 71% of the Earth, so that's enough water (around sea level) for a depth of around 2.6 km. Where you may be having trouble is that you think of 110 km as a great distance. In some ways it is. I wouldn't want to walk it, as it would take me days. But in terms of the size of the Earth, it's not so much. The Earth's radius is about 6371 km. That's about fifty-eight times your 110 km. So what you're basically saying is that you're moving from 6371 to 6481 km. That's less than 2% growth. Yes, that will reduce the shell's depth, but it won't do it by that much. Perhaps from 2.6 km to 2.5 km, a 4% decrease. If we make modest changes in the estimates of the average depth of the ocean or the amount of ocean or the radius of the Earth or the height of the thermosphere, we'll get different answers. Since those estimates are necessarily a bit fuzzy, the variation from that is at least as great as the expected change when moving from sea level to the thermosphere. 

Most authors who have interstellar trade simply make it work like current or medieval trade and ignore the details. The big problem with realistic interstellar trade is the energy cost. It's certainly possible to have a star without heavier elements. Heavier elements come from previous stars that have died. So stars located away from other stars likely have fewer heavy materials (e.g. iron). The problem is that for the energy cost of bringing iron from another star system, you could transmute lighter elements into iron. Since power comes from fusion of light elements together, power's going to be available anywhere. So what can be traded? Information (new discoveries, blueprints, schematics, movies, music, etc.). Unique items. This would be similar to medieval times. Although it was possible to ship food locally then. But this is consistent with shipping coffee, tea, spices, etc. Note that you need FTL to make even that trade work. Trading via generation ships has several problems. First, they're slower than light, so you could have finished your information trade sooner by radio. Second, the exporter has to pay to create them but has no guarantee of a return (also a problem for radio, but less risky). Third, it's hard to motivate future generations by commercial promises made before they were born. So generation ships might bring things to trade, but they are unlikely to be built for the purpose of trading. So you can have FTL trade similar to the medieval trade between Europe and China, expensive and only good for luxury goods. Given FTL, that seems reasonable. Ships would buy goods in one system and try to trade them in another. If you really want trade more like modern trade, where we ship out of season vegetables from South America, then you'll probably have to handwave it. The closest to a realistic way to do this is folded space, where you take shortcuts. And even that requires space to be folded in the right way first. If you need to use energy to fold the space in the first place, it's probably a no go again. The problem with comparative advantage here is that some things just aren't worth trading. If I'm only willing to pay 100 for something that costs 1000 to make, then you can't trade with me. Trading generally requires that shipping costs be less than the worth of the final item. To trade iron from Mars, we'd first have to justify the cost of shipping iron from Mars. Since iron is cheap and easily available on Earth, this seems difficult. It's also worth noting that the asteroid belt is going to be cheaper in energy terms. Less gravity trumps more distance. 

Ash's answer lays out some good ideas for how different plant species dying off would end the world, but I'm not certain that it's possible for a plant virus to have the properties you want in the first place. For one thing, they're not usually that deadly. (Tobacco mosaic virus or TMV, a well-studied plant virus, does a tremendous amount of economic damage, but each individual plant is only stunted, not killed. Though expensive, it would be possible to out-produce the losses.) They also have difficulties in transmission vectors. The normal vectors are physical contact between infected plants or through intermediary animals (usually pollinators, grazers, or worms). As far as I can tell, there are no airborne plant viruses - probably fortunately. Since these vectors require plants and animals to be active, it wouldn't be very good at spreading in cold or sparsely-populated areas. You might want to change the backstory to focus on chemical warfare (chemical toxins won't spread themselves - usually - but once in the ground, they can be devilishly difficult to remove) - or simply say that the plants died and with the world falling into chaos, they never did figure out exactly why. 

The immediate problem wouldn't be the radiation or blasts - I wouldn't go near, say, Cheyenne Mountain but for the majority of the planet's surface, that wouldn't be your issue. Your issue would be the enormous quantities of dust and dirt kicked up by the detonations, along with particulate matter from the explosions themselves. Very large volcanic eruptions have been known to cause volcanic winters over large parts of the globe, with cooling, sharply reduced crop yields, and the like. For most eruptions, these effects mostly pass after a year or so (or at least I've not seen reference to one that was multiple years long) but my impression is that nuclear winter can last quite a bit longer, and could easily be a mass-extinction event on its own. 

Cattle Cattle already maintain a high bull:cow (male:female) ratio. Expect twenty to thirty cows per bull, so this would still leave bulls in excess. Horses As discussed in the Dick Francis book Banker, one stallion (male) can cover about forty mares (females) a year. Some manage more. Some less. Allowing for less, a thirty to one ratio seems safe and leaves stallions in excess. Chickens The rule of thumb is one rooster (male) for ten hens (females). But some go with lower or higher numbers of hens per rooster. Eating the excess hens rather than the no longer in excess roosters could bring this back into balance for those who prefer a ratio less than ten to one. Bees Bee reproduction is self-regulating. Drones (male) come from unfertilized eggs, having just one parent (a mother, a queen). Female bees (worker or queen) come from fertilized eggs (two parents, a drone and a queen). So if nine in ten drones die before mating, bees would make more drones. You could also exempt bees as "not animals", but even if you do include them, it doesn't end the world. It does increase the egg laying requirements slightly. Bees are interesting because they are really important for crop pollination. Ending bees might end the world, so it's good to see that that wouldn't happen. Hermaphrodites I'm going to assume that any species that has both male and female organs in the same organism will not be affected. So most plants and earthworms would be safe. Also, those sex changing fish. Asexual production for bacteria and algae would be unaffected. Species die off It is quite possible that some individual species might not be able to survive this. Some may have consequences. Bees and earthworms were the two most wide ranging problems, but bees should be OK and earthworms would reasonably be exempt. Domesticated species should be able to handle things, as they have excess breeding capacity. 

Depending on the exact combat role and environment, you might try something like a drone - probably a rotor-using type. In low-gravity environments, they aren't as limited by weight. Relatively small size would let them get away with minimal armor, and if used in conjunction with a larger tender vehicle, they could carry larger weapons with limited ammunition (missiles or the equivalent). They could fly over all those pesky obstructions, deal with enemy snipers or missile crews in high buildings, and otherwise maneuver much more easily in an urban environment than any ground-borne vehicle. In terms of combat role, they would be subordinate to infantry; basically they're a crew-serviced heavy weapon with the added benefit that the weapon can fly out ahead of the crew without putting them (or their truck full of spare missiles...) in danger. The infantry moves in first and whenever they encounter anything too tough for them to deal with, the drones converge to offer fire support. 

As you mentioned, there doesn't appear to be a lot of information about this online, but it does seem some gemstones are associated with different metal ores. Quartz is associated with gold and a few other types of veins, and forms a variety of gemstones (amethyst, citrine, rose quartz, etc.), but I don't know if quartz veins actually contain any useful gemstone-quality pieces. (Quartz vein mining appears to be less common today, but was a big deal in the past; most of the well-known gold rushes went after quartz veins.) I'm told beryl (emerald, aquamarine, heliodor) is associated with tin ores. Aside from this, it's worth noting that some metal ores can be passably pretty rocks in their own right; precious metal ores wouldn't be used that way since they're more valuable processed, but e.g. hematite (a major iron ore) can be either a glossy black stone, which was valued as a gem in Victorian times, or banded blood red/black. Azurite and malachite are well-known semi-precious gems that are also copper ores. 

Five fingers The system of tally marks that I learned had a special symbol for every fifth number. The first four were vertical lines, something like , but the fifth was a diagonal line across the previous four. Roman numerals had special behavior in groups of five and ten. The Mayans used a base 20 system -- the total number of fingers and toes. And of course the modern system that we use is base 10. Computers Binary. This is the simplest number system to implement for a computer. This will be true regardless of the number of appendages. However, we are bilateral. Two eyes; two ears; two nostrils; two arms; two legs; as well as two sexes, etc. That might have mattered. Octal and Hexadecimal. These are more complicated. They are natural alternatives to binary. Each digit can be represented by three or four binary digits (bits) and covers all possibilities. But why those two? Why not base 4 or base 32? The most likely explanation is that we found these two most natural because we already used base 10 and these are the two closest that have direct translations to binary. On the other hand, we did choose hexadecimal over octal, even though octal is closer to having the same number of digits as decimal. From a binary perspective, sixteen is a nicer number than eight. $10^{100}$ rather than $10^{11}$. Unary. A simple system, but wasteful to record. One unary digit can only hold two numbers (zero or one). Two unary digits can hold three values, etc. Sixty-four unary digits can only only sixty-five values. Contrast that with binary where sixty-four bits is enough to hold eighteen quintillion values. An advanced alien race might understand unary, but they seem unlikely to use it for anything. Ternary. There are three types of charge in nature: positive from protons; negative from electrons; neutral from neutrons. Aliens that had more of a connection to the number three might use positive/neutral/negative rather than our on/off (binary). This would be really alien to us. Others Duodecimal. The first four counting numbers all divide twelve. This is true regardless of base. This makes twelve a natural number for a base that transcends number of appendages. That said, I think that the advantage is small enough that an alien race is unlikely to use it unless they have some stronger connection (e.g. twelve fingers). It's interesting that the main way we use this is to tell time, where divisions are most natural and useful. Sexagesimal. Divides all of the first six numbers evenly. However, it doesn't divide the next three and will divide fewer and fewer numbers. Again, this seems like a number system that mathematicians would naturally consider but not one that would become popular on its own merits. The Babylonians sort of had a sexagesimal system, but it's organized as six groups of ten. Conclusions The most likely number system to be understandable by aliens is binary. Its on/off nature makes it easy to represent plus it is one of the two most natural number systems, regardless of appendages. The only number system that might block binary is ternary. So if you're going for a sharable number system, binary would be our best chance. If instead your goal is to describe an alien mathematics and you want it to be as alien as possible, try ternary. Dividing things in two is natural to us. What if an alien race found dividing into threes more natural? Three sexes. Trilateral. Or even just not bilateral. Maybe our prejudice towards binary is caused by our nature. Maybe a unisexual species without identical parts at all might think of things differently. Hard for us to tell, as we're the only intelligent species whose development we know. Both binary and ternary are systems that computers could use. This makes them natural for advanced civilizations. They would almost certainly develop at least one of them. Of course, we don't use binary as our normal number system. We use decimal, based on our number of manipulative digits (fingers). Another species might use the same basis for their most common number system. What might a species that does not have a fixed number of digits pick as a number system? I think that binary and ternary are still the natural number systems when they get past unary. After that, they may well pick a base like sixteen or twenty-seven as a convenient abbreviation. If they are exceptionally mathematically oriented (number theory and/or geometry), they might pick something like sexagesimal before developing computers. Maybe. Note that this is all speculation. We have no real basis for saying how someone not like us would develop number systems. Our only example is us. And we don't actually know why we chose to do things the way that we did. If we were different, would we have made different choices? Or the same choices--possibly for different reasons? 

By reading the raw thoughts of an entity, it removes all borders of language; except when it has to translate those thoughts into a language. While constructed, logical languages designed to convey raw speech like Lojban are available, the receiving party would have to speak this logical language without error for this translator to be 100% accurate. This technology would have other ramifications. If this translator is owned by a company or a government, then the users could complain about how this device could be used to read their minds for their own hidden agenda. What's your choice? I'd say a mix of the first two.. Intra-family translations will be much more accurate than between language families. Otherwise, it should have the capabilities a little better than Google Translate. 

This takes place in the optimistic future. While a war general is strategizing his plans of attack, he rejects using outdated war games of the past, and instead tasks a few members of his team to operate on one of the few universe simulators that the government has. While the scientists of the team know how to form the civilization, it requires that a few civilizations in the universe speak the same language, follow these social conventions, etc. etc. How would they direct these civilizations to form the team's desired cultures? Just a few Notes: 

Somebody invented and patented a technology that can read the raw thoughts of a person. Alien and human minds are alike enough for this technology. People are okay with their thoughts being read! 

It seems to me that this is over-engineered. We already have a method for taking carbon dioxide from the atmosphere that requires water and sunlight and produces oxygen and hydrocarbons as a side effect. Why add extra steps? 

No guns This sounds a lot like Japan. The laws against everyday citizens owning weapons in Japan are very old. Basically, lords and their samurai were able to have weapons, but others could only be armed at the lords' discretion. Guns (and swords) are generally illegal in Japan now. Their level of gun ownership is miniscule. Even police officers don't take their guns home. They leave them at the police station. Japan has very little gun violence. Part of this is simply that they have no guns. Part of this is that simply carrying a gun (or bullets) is illegal under almost all circumstances. Part of this is their lack of an exclusionary rule. In Japan, you can't argue that a search was invalid and have the results thrown out. You can sue for an invalid search, but if the search is successful, then the search is generally considered valid. Regardless, if evidence is found, it can be used. Harsher penalties There are four reasons to imprison someone: 

Snowpacks wouldn't form. So in the spring, there would be no source of water to swell the river size. This would make rivers more static and would make it more likely that they would dry out in hot, dry weather in summer. On the Earth, there would be less water trapped as ice at the poles or in glaciers, so the sea level would be higher and there would be less land (Coloradans might take daytrips to the beach...in Kansas). The oceans would also be less salty. The Salt Lake might not be so salty. The Dead Sea might not be dead. No glaciers might mean no fjords (Slartibartfast would be sad). Water would have less ability to crack things. Now, water seeps into places, freezes, and cracks open the larger rock. So weathering would be less effective. There would be more big rocks and fewer small stones. Note that a small change, perhaps a degree or two, would be unlikely to have much effect. But that's also true of changing the boiling point. I'm assuming a large change, say to -40 degrees (same in both scales). That's a rare temperature in most places, so most places would never see frozen water. And even fewer places would see frozen water year round. Ice ages would be brisk ages or something, making them more survivable. People, animals, and plants would not experience frostbite until the lower freezing temperature. They might still experience hypothermia. The Earth might still have dinosaurs, as they might better survive the cold periods. 

If you're set on the idea of slave raids (as opposed to the slavers buying or extorting people from their settlements), consider making them stealthier. Slavers are basically predators, after all, and when falling on herds predators always single out the weak and isolated. Now weak victims don't make all that useful of slaves, so logic dictates they'll go after people who are alone or in small groups - tending the outlying fields, say, or on journeys to other villages. Each settlement has a fortified core that can repel slaver raids, but sooner or later somebody has to take a chance and venture further out. Alternatively, what if they bring back indentured servitude? In a society like this, most people are going to be spending most of their time performing manual labor anyway, so doing it for someone else isn't that big of a change, and it can be safer working under the thumb of a domineering landlord than taking your chances as a subsistence farmer. Depending on the circumstances, your lot in life might actually improve. ("It sucks having to do what Mr. Johnson says, but at least there's clean water and no dire coyotes.") There's no need for raids and corrals and guards if the slaves volunteered. 

Completely abolishing currency as a concept is probably not going to happen; it's just too convenient. However, you do have the benefit that there are some drawbacks to the two major contenders here. The illegality-on-its-face is probably a big deterrent to your drug becoming a de facto currency. Non-users might think it's too much of a risk for a commodity they don't even want; even users might think it puts too much of their money reserve at risk, or might worry that having too much cash would bump up the charges if they're caught (e.g. from possession to possession with intent). On the other hand, avoiding them all using cash would seem pretty simple: if not many people have legitimate, cash-paying jobs, compared to the number of people who (legally or illegally) buy outside goods with cash, there simply won't be enough of it for the economy to run smoothly. One interesting direction you might go is towards social stratification (even in the slums - as Pratchett once wrote, the rungs on the ladder might be close together here, but people watch them very carefully). Having cash on hand is a sign that you have a good job, probably stable; spending cash on outside goods is a sign of luxury. Conversely, since the drug is looked down upon and isn't universally used, using it for trade is low-class and "vulgar". So you have two coexisting economies - one in cash, the other in drugs - and the proportion to which one belongs to one or the other is a major sign of social status. Because of that, you have a lot of essentially artificial restrictions on who pays whom in what. Well-to-do (relatively speaking) people might not want to deal in drugs on principle, or because it would make them look low-class, and the lowest of the low might not deal in cash because they can't trade it easily or it would be seen as selling out. To make this work at the boundary, people barter things with a neutral connotation (e.g., if I'm a doctor, I prefer cash, but I'll take a chicken over being seen getting paid in drugs). The trick for you, then, is setting the story in that border, where people sometimes deal in cash and sometimes deal in drugs, but often deal in barter - and have to navigate vendors, brokers, contacts, etc. who want to get paid in one or the other. Both money and drugs are stable(-ish) currencies, but they can be conveniently useless whenever the plot demands. (Admittedly, this does rely on their being a social stigma for the drug, probably in favor of something else - e.g. "only low-class people smoke, we drink beer instead". If that doesn't work for your story, you might need another reason for it to be seen as disreputable as a currency.)
