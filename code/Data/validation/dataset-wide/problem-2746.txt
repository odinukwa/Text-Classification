If you are having a public discussion, you gain nothing by using inappropriate, vulgar, pejorative language. All you would be doing is letting others know your frustration, emotion, anger, etc.. Obviously, if that is the character/reputation you are striving for, then it would be appropriate. 

The answer to your three questions are: 1) No,it was not meant to be taken literally. 2) No, the proportion is not meant to be exact(2:1). 3)Yes, you are missing the point slightly. My summary/interpretation of Epictetus quote is, one should spend more time listening than speaking. 

Yes, the probability of finding an electron at a given distance from its nucleus is analytically derived. 

As an answer, not of the main question, but to the four sub questions, I would like to make the following observations/corrections: 1) another dimension - it is a valid possibility because there would be nothing wrong if we did not experience the passage of time. As a matter of fact, that is what "everlasting" means - time stops! Our universe consists of 3 spatial dimensions and one temporal dimension. If we "moved" to a universe with 4 spatial dimensions, our temporal dimension (call it 3D time) would stop. Although there is no reason there would not be a higher temporal dimension (4D time), nevertheless, our 3D time would no longer exist - but that's a good thing. 2)another universe - if we define universe as "accessible to us," then there is the possibility that there are other universes that we are not "aware off." 3) "Heat death" and "infinite entropy" are one and the same thing. So, if God "adds energy" (causes the universe to contract), at certain intervals, He can maintain entropy within some bounds forever. 4)heaven, currently, exists only in our minds. After Jesus returns, heaven (a physical place) will be on earth. Some of us will dwell in this heaven, while others will be "pure sentient energy" and will dwell in God (in a higher dimension). 

Quantum mechanics does not disprove determinism. Although some people would like to use QM for that purpose, it is a very weak argument, if at all. A much stronger basis is, Chaos and/or non-linear functions. Any system that obeys/follows a non-linear function - is non-deterministic. The majority of systems, including the Universe, are non-linear systems, therefore non-deterministic. Since most of the advancement of science is due to work on linear systems, we have developed the mistaken notion that the "linear systems" are the predominant ones, and therefore - the "world" is linear (= deterministic), when just the opposite, is true! 

The belief/view you are looking for might be found in "be your brother's keeper", "do no harm", "don't be egotistical"! 

the reason it is an equivocation, is that the meaning of "nothing" changes from the 1st sentence to the 2nd sentence (middle of argument), thereby meeting the definition of equivocation as given in the cited Rulebook for Arguments. 

Let me start by stating that all algorithms are "just software." There are two types of software: 1) Software that performs the same function over time, and 2) one who's function changes over time. For the first type, the programmer provides the "intelligence" for the function. For the second type, the programmer provides some basic functions and the means for the functions to change themselves (self modifying code). Self modifying code is the "critical" requirement to be able to implement some level/version of A.I. Therefore, if after some interval of run time, you examine the computer's code/function and it has changed, then it has AI capability, if it is the same, then it does not. 

It is impossible for you to be someone other than yourself - by definition! By definition, someone else is different (in some way) from you. If (somehow) you were changed to be the same as the other person, then you would no longer be yourself, you would be a copy of the other person. 

Because we live in an imperfect world/society, the legal argument takes precedence and gives rise to the following argument: 

Before you can find "truth," you need to define (or agree to someone else's definition) what "truth" is/means. Then, using that definition, you compare the various statements to determine if they meet the definition. If they do, then you found truth, otherwise, you did not. Since all it takes is one true statement to find truth, then it is very possible to find truth. For example, 2 + 2 = 4 or, 2H + O -> water molecule or, the sun rises and sets every day, etc.. 

Although I am the first to admit that I am not a major philosopher, I am a philosopher and I do think that some parts, not just of the world but of the Universe, are "real," and that "others" are not. I do realize that to be understood, I have to let you know what is my definition of "real." To me, real is anything that I can perceive/observe directly or indirectly by any of my senses. Another way of saying this, is that there are parts of the Universe that are observable and there are parts that are not. God is one of those that are not observable. However, just because they are not observable, does not mean they don't exist! 

From my perspective, the difference between Natural (derived from nature) and Human Rights (applicable to humans), is that Human Rights are a subset of Natural Rights. In addition to being applicable to Humans, Natural Rights apply to animals and (possibly) plants, as well. Thus, Natural Rights is a larger set than Human Rights. 

I think that to be able to answer the question, we need look at a couple of examples that define the "right," and determine its "source." We have the legal right "to assemble peacefully." Its source - the US Constitution. We have the human right "to be treated with respect." Its source - Society. These examples make it clear that human rights do exist, and have existed, since two or more humans decided to coexist in close proximity, thereby forming a "society". 

Lets start with (P<->Q) =/= P <-> ~Q. Since the right side is false when the left side is true, then how do I make the left side false? Negate it, and obtain ~(P<->Q)! 

Rdney, to properly understand your entries, I would need to ask you several additional questions. Since it is not practical, I will answer them as I interpret your entries. I see two questions and one assertion. The first, and main question, can be answered if you simplify it by removing "an Atheist." That leaves, what is 'the "point" to existence'? The point is, to continue (and propagate) existence! Your assertion, that "There is no afterlife," is impossible to prove. The reason is that it is impossible to prove that "something" does not exist! However, if "something" does exist, it might be possible to prove it. On the other hand, not being able to prove that something exists, does not mean that it does not exist. Whether the "afterlife" exists or not, should not be the factor that guides/influences your life. The "golden Rule" would be more appropriate. Since one of the "byproducts" of most religions is the Golden Rule, then you could easily choose to follow a particular religion, or no religion at all (you can follow the Golden Rule on your own). The second question as to, "why don't I just pop a bullet in my head?" the answer has nothing to do with religion (or lack of it). Assuming you are not suffering from depression (or mental problems), the answer depends on whether or not, you feel that there is a useful purpose to your life. Most people that have committed suicide, come to the conclusion (justified or not) that their life does not matter, that there is no useful purpose to their existence, and therefore, might as well end it. So, a person with a useful life purpose, most likely will choose to continue to live, whereas a person with no purpose, most likely would choose to end it.
