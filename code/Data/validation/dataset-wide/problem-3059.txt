Besides accidents and disease mentioned in other answers, there were many combat deaths outside of big battles. "Mines" were a reason. Also, there were many small actions outside of big battles. Armies ran "patrols," and fights would flare up between small groups. There would typically be a lot of artillery fire (more, perhaps in World War I than World War II) between battles that would kill soldiers. Soldiers would be killed by "bombing" (and airmen by anti-aircraft) between battles. Soldiers would get killed "moving," they have been known to collapse and die the ranks, and there were vehicle-related deaths "on the march." (Some would be classified as "accidents" but if they were incurred on the way to battle, or worse, on the retreat, they would be "combat" related.) Big battles are when "most" (combat) deaths occurred, not when all of them occurred. The fighting and killing doesn't stop just because a battle is over; it just goes from "high" intensity to "low" intensity. Put another way, "war" goes on 365 days a year, while "battles" may occupy a multiple of ten days (for a given unit). Those battle days represent a minority of fighting time, although a disproportionate amount of killing does go on during those days. 

Luxury manufacturing in the 17th century was a precursor to more of the same in the 18th and 19th centuries. This was one of the economic policies of Colbert, under Louis XIV, to produce and export high valued added goods such as glassware and tapestry that would earn a lot of foreign exchange for France. Production of these goods represented a form of "industry," although it was a different kind of industry than the factory-based manufacturing that started in England and the U.S. during the Industrial Revolution. France held the lead in this form of industry for several centuries, some would say even today, although not in "industry" overall. This policy worked until the middle to later part of the industrial revolution, when mass produced goods supplanted high-value low volume goods. To give some examples of the later period, champagne manufacturers Moet and Hennessy were started in the mid 18th century. They later merged with leather goods manufacturer, Louis Vuitton, which was started in the mid 19th century. 

Australia was a lot less hospitable area than Polynesians, Indonesians, and other islanders were used to. Although technically in the tropics, the fact that people lived on islands meant that the sea was a moderating influence on the climate, and "temperate" weather crops such as breadfuirt and sweet potatoes could grow on them. Also, the sea provided a ready source of fish. $URL$ Not so Australia, which being continental, had a less temperate climate. Jungles were thicker, crops scarcer, and food harder to find. As mentioned in other answers above, the "Australians" had more potent weapons, probably because of the need to hunt mammals, rather than fish. It's possible that Pacific Islanders found themselves in Australia from time to time. Most probably did not survive. Perhaps a few survivors were absorbed into the local populations. What did NOT happen was people visiting Australia, leaving, and then saying, "Let's go back there with the friends and family. 

Because people from "third world" countries had limited access to "first world" countries until recently (about 1950). The century from about 1850-1950 was the period of European colonialism or imperialism. Basically, the Europeans set the rules. They could go anywhere in the world where the gunboats would take them, and refuse entry to their countries to people from other parts of the world. So Europeans invaded other countries in Africa and Asia for colonization purposes. But only a few wealthy people from these countries were allowed into Europe, mainly to be trained as "subordinate" rulers at say, Oxford or the Sorbonne. Another thing was that while there were fairly large migrations of people, including non-Europeans in the 19th century, they were made under the auspices of large organizations, not individually. So while there were procurers of e.g. Chinese laborers for the American railroads in the 1860s and 1870s, they were discouraged from continuing in the 1880s by the American authorities. Former British colonies like America, Canada or Australia were white immigration countries. America passed the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882, and concluded a "Gentleman's agreement with Japan to restrict Asian immigration. Granted, these measures were "extreme" by European standards, but they illustrate how unwelcome most non-Europeans would have been in European countries. Finally, communication and transportation was very different a century ago than today. There was no TV, radio or movies that would encourage non-Europeans to emigrate. There was no civilian air travel. The global literacy rate didn't rise above 50% until the 1950s, and was much lower than that in non-European countries. Most people lived on farms and couldn't get to the largest city in their country, let alone travel abroad. There were cruise ships, but only the wealthy enjoyed "first class" accommodations that are commonplace today. Poor people rode ships "steerage" class, next to the cargo, and were treated as such; last in line for food, accommodations, lifeboats, or other amenities. 

Most of the executed people at the Salem Witch trials were women. There were only six men (out of 19). Most of the accused, at least initially, were poor, or social outcasts. Sarah Good was a beggar. Sarah Osborne had remarried an indentured servant. Tituba was a slave from the Caribbean who told strange, "witch" stories to young girls. Many of the accusers were upper middle class girls. Some of them, at least, appear to have been going through the onset of "menses" or other "pubescent" activities, and perhaps projected their latent, repressed, sexuality, on the unfortunate women mentioned earlier. Essentially, a number of women were charged, not with "witchcraft," per se, but of "corrupting" these young girls. So were at least two men, John Proctor (who seduced Abigail Williams), and George Jacobs Jr. (accused by his daughter in law and granddaughter). And there were a number of economic quarrels about boundaries of farms, etc., that led to various accusations. The statement, "jealously motivated the poor to accuse the rich" isn't really true. What was true was that once the process got under way, some of the original (upper middle class) accusing girls turned around and made accusations against others that were slightly wealthier, instead of just "poor people." The executions took place from June to September 1692. Of the six men (five hanged, one "pressed" to death), four were killed in August, and two in September, after the executions of women had begun. (And women were mostly accused earlier.) On a "time-weighted" basis, women suffered more than 13/19 of the opprobrium, after allowing for the fact that they were indicted, and executed earlier "on average." 

It was Norway. This is the story of Harald Fairhair in the late 9th century. Harald inherited one of a number of petty kingdoms west of modern Oslo. He proposed marriage to Gyda, the daughter of King Erik of a nearby kingdom of similar size. She wanted to be queen of Norway, so she refused to marry anyone who was not king of "all" Norway. She had created a monster, because Harald took an oath not to cut his hair until he won her. He went to war and conquered several other Norwegian kingdoms, making him the strongest king in Norway. Finally, the remaining Norwegian kings, including Gyda's own father, Erik, banded together against him for self-protection. Harald won the resulting battle of Hafrsfjord in which Erik was killed. He then sent for Gyda, who conceded that he had met the conditions, and married him. 

This question can be subdivided into two more: 1) Why Protestantism (Calvinism and Lutheranism) vs. Catholicism and 2) Why Calvinism vs. Lutheranism. 1) For Protestantism over Catholicism. Protestant theology held that Christians were connected to God through the scriptures, rather than through the Church. This came at a time when the (Catholic) church came under heavy suspicion for corrupt practices such as the sale of indulgences. The basic theory was that the "people" had the right to circumvent, and otherwise circumscribe the hierarchy of the Catholic church, (and by implication, secular rulers such as king and queens). This process would cut out the expensive "middlemen," and was highly appealing to subscribers to the so-called "Protestant Ethic." 2) Why Calvinism over Lutheranism: Upper class people were often drawn to Calvinism over Lutheranism, because while both doctrines preached the "election" of Christians by God, Lutheranism put a greater emphasis on faith, while Calvinism preached salvation by "predestination", or God's choice. Under Calvinism, earthly riches and prosperity were a "mark" of God's "choice," a doctrine very appealing to some upper class Protestants such as French nobles (and prosperous Dutch merchants). Calvinism found its rawest form in South Africa, where "Dutch" (including German and French) settlers made it the basis of "apartheid," because of the "obvious" superiority of those settlers over "native" Africans. The Calvinist ethic can be best described by a take-off on the line from "Animal Farm": "All Protestants are equal, but some Protestants are more equal than others." One issue was that Calvin was French, and that may have explained part of the popularity of his doctrines in France, while Luther was German, which may help explain why German nobles tended to follow him.
