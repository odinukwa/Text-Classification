All I can say to this: All is fair in love. All is fair in business. All is fair in war. All is fair in politics. Love = War = Business. War = Violence --> Business = Violence There are economic and price wars. There are hostile take overs. There are different levels of violence. Economic, psychological, physical. Just because there are no bombs being thrown does not mean that there are no weapons of financial mass desctruction.. 

One property of segments who conform to the golden ratio is that they are foldable. Just look at the way you can "roll up" your index finger snugly inside your thumb. That would not work if the segments of the index finger were all in the same length or if the outmost segment was shorter and did not conform to the ratio. By being able to do this "snugly" it adds to stability. Stability = good. I'd say. 

Gift "Middle English: from Old Norse gipt; related to give." So a "Gift" is something that you have giveth. Or you gave to some person, without receiving anything directly in return. Since the purpose of Gifts are usually to strengthen social bonds there is no "free" gift. Depending on society the receiver will be obligated towards the giver/gifter in some way. If only subconsciously. 

Sure. The so-called "twin paradox" in special relativity trivially answers that question "yes". In fact, I believe they've flown atomic clocks on the ISS to experimentally demonstrate that kind of thing, $URL$ (and google coughs up lots of similar links). Your phrase "altering the physical properties" might need to clarify "properties" to accommodate relativity's postulates more directly. "State of motion (inertial frame)" or "gravitational potential" (for general relativity tests) would be more direct examples, but I'm supposing you'd accept those as "physical properties". 

Yes, he (correctly) means "a formal-symbol manipulating device". But "manipulation" needs a little clarification. The usual textbook formalism is given by the lambda calculus, e.g., $URL$ (google "lambda calculus" for lots more). But electronic devices natively implement only a much simpler (architecture-dependent) machine language, something typically more-or-less like Knuth's MIX, e.g., $URL$ (google "Knuth MIX"). However, a lambda-calculus-interpreter can always be written in any such machine language. Indeed, "Church's Thesis" and "Turing Completeness" (more terms for you to google) guarantee that just about any sensible formal idea of "manipulation" is ultimately equivalent to all others. That is, there's a class of so-called "computable functions" (google that), meaning that a sequence of symbols representing input (the function's argument) can be manipulated into another sequence representing output (the function's value). If no such manipulations exist, the function's not computable (google "halting function" for a non-computable example). And all computer languages, i.e., all formal ideas of "manipulation", can ultimately calculate exactly the same class of computable functions. So Searle's ultimately and equivalently saying that consciousness isn't (can't be simulated by) computable functions. But your comment, "...defining a computer as a symbol-manipulating device just seems to add fog to the AI landscape", seems to conflate AI with consciousness. AI, aka "expert systems", are certainly computable, but certainly not consciousness. And nobody ever claims any such thing. I think maybe your question arises from a misunderstanding about that. Edit... Hmm, now taking a look at your profile, I wouldn't imagine you'd have any confusion/misunderstanding about that. But then I don't see how you'd have any question about Searle's remark whatsoever. So what's your question, more exactly? Edit (reply to Roddus' comment below)... Firstly, for concreteness, let's please do away with this unnecessarily vague "voltage level" terminology, which you've used here and in preceding comments above. See, e.g., $URL$ for the correspondence between bits and voltage levels. We're talking about Searle's "symbols" (sequences of bits), regardless of their physical representation, which simply happens to be voltage levels in electronic digital computers. Regarding "meaning", with respect to computers, I'd guess what you might want to study could be "denotational semantics" (e.g., $URL$ and many other google hits) and "domain theory" (e.g., $URL$ ). Then it's the so-called "semantic function", which maps syntax (the denotation represented by strings of symbols) to semantics (the syntax's meaning represented in a so-called Scott domain), that captures the mathematical idea of "meaning" as it pertains to computability. The short paper $URL$ seems like a pretty good intro to me (I'm not googling any wikipedia-type stuff that comes anywhere near adequate). A longer-but-more-comprehensive intro is (seems to me) $URL$ And/or try googling "semantic function" denotational (put "semantic function" in quotes as shown, followed by denotational) for additional tutorial papers. As for Searle and his Chinese Room conclusions, you'd need to compare and contrast "meaning" with respect to computers, versus "meaning" with respect to consciousness. But only the former is well-enough-defined for any rigorous comparison. And if you're really interested, I think you might need to further study domains, maybe particularly the idea of approximation as represented by their poset ordering, whereby "meaning" can start out vague and become better-and-better defined with more-and-more syntax. But that would involve a pretty significant effort, far afield from any direct relation to "consciousness". So I wouldn't recommend it unless you're really, really interested. The theoretical computer science aspects might (again judging from your profile) be adequately interesting, but maybe not the related-to-consciousness aspects... Are computers (i.e., can computers simulate) "conscious"? Or can they exhibit behaviour indistinguishable from consciousness? Searle apparently says "no". Whether or not his argument's conclusive is maybe debatable, but his definition of "computer" is entirely adequate. Any further argument would have to discuss the ultimate capabilities of "symbol manipulation" -- just how far can that take you? And that's indeed somewhat of an open question. It's closed with respect to computable function theory, but meaning/semantics/etc not equally well closed. 

The only way something can be wrong is if to dosn't work this way. Example: You are doing this wrong. It's not going to work this way. But if it works and produces results then it cannot be wrong. It may be suboptimal but not wrong. 

Pars pro toto essentially means a part stands for the whole wikipedia Grounded logic essentially means tangible or connected. wikipedia grounded terms Part for a whole = the same as god or made up of parts of god, or Grounded in God following his logic or thinking or based on him, depended on him. 

According to karma you get what you give. Karma = cause and action (Wikipedia) Now if you gain/retain you somehow get more than you give. So there is an imbalance between the receiving and the giving part. Eventually the gap/difference between the giving potential and the actual giving could become to great. But what you get must not be of the same form as what you give. So that means you can offset your gain in one currency by providing or giving in another currency. For example leadership. So you could be a leader that gives leadership and receives sustenance and power in return. If you keep on giving good leadership then the universe or karma or people or your subconscious will help you in getting compensated accordingly. So instead of asking, can you gain without loosing I'd ask. Can you loose without gaining? The answer is of course yes. Every possession is a burden. If you loose a possession like an amulet or watch or anything ornamentally. You have lost an item but gained space to replace the item with another one. In essence you have regained freedom. 

Novel or otherwise, I think it's wrong. Since you're apparently into programming, just consider dentotational semantics, e.g., $URL$ That provides a syntax-->semantics (predicatbly called the "semantic function") from syntax into a domain (see, e.g., $URL$ of meanings. And for programs, that semantic domain's typically (continuous wrt Scott topology) functions N-->N. And these aren't physically "measurable", per se, in your sense (the measure theory meaning of "measurable" notwithstanding), and there's no notion of archetype (that I'm aware of) distinguishing one such function from another. They're just abstract meanings with no (unlike Plato's cave) physical-world manifestations that could be "measured". 

As briefly cited about halfway-down the "hardly new" link posted by @TimBII, it's the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, e.g., $URL$ (google "Sapir-Whorf" for many other references), that directly investigates exactly what you're suggesting. 

There are various theories whereby spacetime (the whole ball of wax) is emergent, e.g., $URL$ Reading between the lines of your question, I'd guess the best way for you to think about it intuitively is as follows. What's more fundamental: "objects" or "events"? To best interpret time as just another dimension, instantaneous "events" would be the better answer. Then, say, "eating breakfast" and "eating lunch" are two events, separated not only by the distance between the two restaurants you ate at, but by the several hours difference when you ate the meals. In this kind of view, "objects" are just highly-correlated (and kind-of-continuous) sequences of events. 

This video: Youtube: RSA Animate: The Divided Brain could help. Basically you have a right hemisphere which just notices movement and is at one with the environment. I myself have noticed that when I'm in "right brain mode" I "function" according to thresholds. I.e. I go eat when I'm hungry vs it's 12 o'clock and I need to eat. So the focus would either be on the details (left brain) or the whole (right brain). The more you focus on the details, the slower time becomes, especially if nothing changes. If you focus on the whole and you being a part of it, evolving with it you are not noticing time or details. There is a concept called Wikipedia:flow that talks about this state. 

You can validate Induction by creating a (climate) model and run it. The only problem I see with induction is that the person doing the induction is part of the thing it induces. So this is like the observer effect. You are affecting the system as you are measuring or inducing it. That's why we are supposed to live in the now. For that is what only exists. The past and the future and the now we are talking about while we are talking about don't really exist. While you talk about the now it has already passed. You cannot talk about the now. You can only be in the now. Or in other words you are the now. Now that means now is you and you is now. You would induce yourself which would mean you are no longer you and in the now but creating a simulation of yourself which is born out of you but not identical with you. So my summary is: Any induction is by definition talking about a smaller group of relations than the relations it tries to describe because it is a new relation itself. Thus it is always imperfect. 

I don't mean to be rude, but I think your question is based on several falsehoods that have been addressed in some form or another, so I'll try to address them one at a time. Do scientists look down on "believers"? First of all, as a physicist, I don't believe scientists do look down upon or denigrate "believers" or religion per se, and yes, many scientists are believers. What scientists do object to is some of the behaviour of a few religious people, such as insisting that religious beliefs be taught in a science class (this was a criticism of Alan I. Leshner, the CEO of the AAAS, the society that provided that poll you reference). In fact, I would assert that scientists specifically don't tend to target religions, but rather a handful of people from those religions that try to affect science in some way. I can't find anything that definitively links scientists with denigrating religion (aside from people like Hitchens, Dawkins), but if you look at the survey you reference, only 40% of people view clergy members as having a positive impact on society (versus 70% for scientists), so it may be a cultural thing in the US. (Yes, I realize clergy does not equal church or religion as a whole, so take this whole argument with a GIANT grain of salt). Most Scientists are believers As pointed out by Mozibur Ullah and Discrete lizard, this is not a straightforward statement to prove. First of all, the US is quite religious compared to many other places. In a survey, 69% of Americans rated religion as important, compared with just 42% in neighbouring Canada (Note 1; yes I realize it is Wikipedia, feel free to find other sources). That poll you quote is far from definitive, 51% does not mean a majority, it means, probably a majority (Note 2). The actual number is 32% +/- 2.5% 95% confidence interval (CI) for people that believe in god, plus 18% +/- 2.5% 95% CI for people that believe in some higher power. Meaning if you ran that same survey 20 times, you would get values outside that region on the one of those surveys (on average). This only means that when you add these together you get approximately 50% of scientists believe in god or some higher power, with the caveat that it might be a majority by a few percent, or it might be a minority by a few percent. 

Lots of overhead in order to do work. You can only employ one human to do this job since lots of waste accumulates. Little overhead. You can use the savings to employ more people to do more work with the same amount of money/energy/time/food. 

Is the soul not eternal? Can the soul change? If it does then yes it moves. If it does not then it is static and motion-less. 

What does exist however is change. Can you travel in change? No, because you yourself are change, part of change. See it as a guitar - string that has been plucked and resonates or an echo chamber. But with the only difference that the echo or sound does not get muted but stays the same power, but only changes frequency and the echo chamber changing shape as a response to the frequency. Could you go back in time then to a place where there was a certain mixture of frequencies and a certain shape of the echo chamber? Theoretically yes. All you'd need was a substantially good sound-system and some means of measuring the actual and desired sound and shape characteristics inside the echo chamber without having the sound system and yourself inside the chamber to begin with, otherwise it probably would not be the same, unless you could cloak yourself or make yourself and the system acoustically transparent. The final thing you'd need would be some computer or device that could compute the necessary output frequency mixtures (properly positioned in dimensional space, no less), to get to where you want to be. Of course this needs to be transparent or non existent as well. Really simple when you think about it. Just use some non existing equipment and change history. :P 

Maybe think risk(to others) versus benefit(to you), and a personal "selfishness threshhold" defined by the risk/benefit ratio below which you'll comply with the request (and above which you'll refuse). And consider that in the context of alternative scenarios, e.g., your original... 

Regarding mathematics~computation, as @rus9384 says in his comment below your question, "...mathematics is not computation, devising theories is not computation." So your premise is ab initio wrong. But it's partly right -- mathematical proofs >>are<< computation, by the Curry-Howard isomorphism, e.g., $URL$ It's conjuring up axiomatic systems from which theorems are subsequently derived that's not computational (although, as far as I know, nobody's satisfactorily formally defined what that "conjuring up" is). By the way, as per, e.g., $URL$ a "theory" is "an axiomatic system and all its derived theorems", so @rus9384 should have phrased his comment a little more precisely -- the axiomatic system isn't computational, whereas the derived theorems are. As far as philosophy~mathematics goes, your "language and symbols" remarks sound like they're coming straight from Carnap, logical positivism, Quine, analytic philosophy, etc, e.g., $URL$ So in that particular school of thought, sounds like you're pretty much barking up the right tree. 

The definition according to the built in dictionary of OS X is: profoundly immoral or malevolent. So there are morals and will involved. Morals are about right and wrong. And I quote again the OS X dictionary: 

Is there a way to objectively determine which is better? Kill injure person and damage a car and a tree or kill several people. After reading this story about people preferring to save 10 people, but only if it is not themselves in the car. $URL$ Essentially it makes sense to me to not want to sacrifice yourself by default. What if there are no pedestrians but the car runs into the tree or other car anyway? I know this situation is very hypothetical and I guess that's the problem with this question. Hypothetically it makes sense to favor the many over the few. But not in every situation. Is there a simple logical way to deduce this though? 

Is it possible to have an original thought and express it in english? Yes you can have an original thought. And then later you can express this though in English. Just because you are using a language not invented by you does not preclude you from having your own original thoughts and express them in any way means shape or form. You may not have been the first to express this thought, but that does not mean that it did not originate from you in the first place. Everybody can become hungry. Yet you probably would not say that you are copying your hungriness from others when you express that you are hungry using the English language. 

Where are you getting these numbers from? Also, a LOT of science is done in Europe and Asia, very likely more than the US, it it is pretty important to consider those. Having lived in Latin America, I can tell you that not a lot of science goes on there, and neither does a lot happen in the Middle East (although it is growing in the Middle East). When you add on Europe, Japan, China, Russia, etc, I strongly suspect that that number will start to trend in one direction or another, but I doubt it would ever "skyrocket". Science and Religion are NOT in Conflict You state that you "know that science and religion are NOT in conflict", that really depends on your religious views. For example, if you religion depends entirely on the Earth being exactly 1000 years old and a geologist tells you that the Earth is more like 5 billion years old, then yes, they are in conflict. That isn't to say that it is always in conflict, for example you may believe in the the Big Bang, but that it was created by a deity. The reality science and religion are different at a fundamental level. Religion has a set of rules, and facts that affect ones world view, much of which must be taken on faith. Science on the other hand, aims to take as little on faith as possible, and instead requires us to update our world view. What we take on faith is usually stuff that we don't have time to learn enough about. For example I know very little about the Big Bang, but I know that many researchers have spent their lives doing research and I know a little bit about the most important points, so if I encounter someone who has a strong argument against one of those points, I may not be able to answer it properly, but I take it on faith that it likely has been answered (admittedly, it could be an open question in that field). Asking whether or not science and religion are compatible is kind of like asking if music and potatoes are compatible. Aspects of the two may clash, or the may not; aspects of the two may even coincide. Hitchen's Patent and Scientists agreement First of all, people like Hitchens (and Dawkins) are extremely polarized people, I'm sure if you spent a bit of time looking you could probably find people that have similar views as Hitchens without the attitude. I almost feel sorry that your introduction to atheism was Hitchens and not Bill Nye or something. Second of all, I have never encountered this argument that non-scientists like Hitchens claim a patent on science, and even if they did, I would say that is certainly untrue. Science, by it's very nature, is everywhere and for everyone, should they choose to explore it (provided they can afford it; this is perhaps another similarity that science has with some religions). Third, I think your "scientists themselves seem to disagree with them" statement is probably in reference to your poll, but I've already addressed that for the most part. I would just like to reiterate that science and aren't inherently compatible or incompatible. Note 1: $URL$ Note 2: $URL$ 

@jobermark mentioned Popper, but I think neglected to explicitly mention his major contribution, falsifiablilty, relevant to your question (though I think he hinted at it). What's not relevant is that observations may confirm one or more theories. Conversely, it's the sine qua non of a (scientific) theory that it must be falsifiable. Then any observation contrary to a theory's predictions disproves it. You're kind of trying to say that observations confirm theories, and in fact may confirm many different theories. But no number of observations confirm any theory; they're merely consistent with one (or more) theories. And there's no problem about the consistency of a set of observations with several different theories. Popper's point is that as you make more and more observations, you'll (hopefully) begin to come across inconsistent observations that eventually falsify all-but-one of your theories. And even then, the remaining theory hasn't been absolutely confirmed, per se. Theories aren't confirmable, they're falsifiable. 

I'd suggest whether or not "metaphysics should care about physics" all depends on how close current physical theory actually is to the "ultimate truth" (whatever that might be, if it even exists). On the one hand, suppose current physical theory is indeed very close to the so-called "theory of everything", and that only a few more bells-and-whistles are needed to construct a completely satisfactory theory of all existence, with no loose ends remaining whatsoever. Then, yeah, metaphysics should care lots about what physics is saying, because the entire metaphysics programme would just amount to an interpretation of exactly that perfect final theory. On the other hand, ancient Greek metaphysicians would have been well-advised not to care about the epicycle theory of planetary motion, which was based on the topsy-turvy wrong idea that the Sun and planets revolve around the Earth (at least they got it right about the Moon). So grounding your metaphysics on that entirely wrong physics gets you nowhere: garbage-in, garbage-out. So is today's physics finally barking up the right metaphysical tree, or is it just an epicycles-like numbers game intricately manipulated to obtain results that agree with observations, but based on an entirely erroneous conception of reality? If forced to place a bet, I'd personally bet on erroneous simply due to the odds, i.e., "there are more things in heaven and earth...". Moreover, it's more metaphysical fun to dream up something entirely new, but then it's dangerous to take such dreams too seriously, which seems to be an under-recognized problem by some metaphysicians. Edit (reply to @YechiamWeiss comment) copy of Y.W.'s comment:   It seems to me like you're switching the metaphysics and physics in their relation - it's physics that's (supposedly) built upon metaphysics, not the other way around. Maybe metaphysicians (philosophers of science) think physics is "supposedly built" [your words] on metaphysics, but that's not what the physicists doing the actual building think. And although they (physicists) typically can't help having some metaphysical predispositions, that isn't typically the ultimate determining factor in the direction of their research. Experimental observations and then mathematical elegance more typically are. In the long run, an elegant metaphysics that's also consistent with the physics hopefully emerges, in which case you can reconstruct the entire edifice as though ground-up/ab initio based on the foundational metaphysics. And that'll be more elegant, but it won't be what historically happened. To wit, note the "shut up and calculate" school of thought $URL$ which explicitly (and maybe a little facetiously) downplays any role for metaphysics, although the "shut up and contemplate" alternative also cited there somewhat softens that position. There may be some philosophers who hold the "physics that's (supposedly) built upon metaphysics" position, but in my opinion that's pretty (and totally unjustifiably) pompous. It presupposes the intelligence/insight/whatever to more-or-less foundationally intuit the world through pure thought alone. However, for example, there's not one single philosopher nor one single physicist who anticipated any of the non-classical aspects of the world that came to light in the twentieth (and very late nineteenth) century. Everybody got dragged kicking and screaming into that new view of reality. But at least the physicists completely openly admitted their own prior stupidity (okay, eventually admitted), whereas my sense is that philosophers aren't quite so open about that (although I know next-to-nothing about it). In any case, admitted or not, it's true. And that suggests experimental evidence is a necessary crutch for human thought about the nature of the world. It happened with epicycles, it happened with phlogiston, with the atomic/molecular theory of matter/chemistry, with non-Galilean relativity, with discrete quanta, etc, etc. So are you now trying to tell me that philosophers are finally equipped with everything they need to know, whereby their pure thought alone will come up with the correct foundational picture of the world??? I don't think so!!!
