This is going to depend entirely on how the company treats the whole situation. Actually, it's even more basic than that - it depends on just who created the drug. Let's say you have a guy doing R & D for a large pharmaceutical corporation. If s/he stumbles on this formula, he's going to realize pretty quickly that s/he has just become one of the most powerful individuals on the planet. Chances are, this person is going to hide the formula for a while. If a lot of sci-fi books are to be believed, s/he will try to use it purely for his/her own benefit. [Insert evil genius scenario here]. It becomes more interesting if a group of people discovered this thing. There are a few paths that could be taken: 

In general, the problem with hollow-Earth setups is that objects in hydrostatic equilibrium cannot be hollow - and planets must be in hydrostatic equilibrium. Planets form through collisions of smaller pieces of rock and dust, and eventually accrete enough matter to become substantially large. There is absolutely no way for a planet to form with a hollow interior; it should have been compacted during its formation. In a typical hollow world that is fully enclosed, there should be virtually no net gravitational force on a person inside. For a spherical mass distribution, the shell theorem states that anyone inside a spherically symmetric shell should feel no net gravitational force from the shell. There will, of course, be variations in mass density, but they wouldn't add up to anything substantial. A semi-open shell means that the shell theorem is not fully valid, but it does seem to imply that there will be very little gravity. It seems like the planet is perhaps 2/3 enclosed; while that fails to satisfy the spherical symmetry requirement, it seems to imply that the shell will mostly cancel itself out. Additionally, having the shell only partially enclosed means that the atmosphere has a chance of escaping to the outside of the planet through diffusion, where it will indeed feel a net force - centered on the center of mass of the planet, which is probably the center of the shell. There would still be some left inside, I would assume, but much could escape to the outside. I don't know how significant this could be, though. Jason K suggested using rotation to keep things on the inside surface of the planet inside, via the fictitious centrifugal force. Here, the magnitude of the centrifugal force is the same as that of the centripetal force at the equator - the place where it is strongest - is $$|\mathbf{F}|=F=m\omega^2R$$ where $m$ is the mass of an object, $\omega$ is the angular speed of the planet, and $R$ is the radius of the inside of the shell. The magnitude of the angular acceleration is then $$|\mathbf{a}|=a=\omega^2R$$ Assuming that the planet rotates at the same speed as Earth, and its inner surface has the same radius as the Earth, then $$|\mathbf{a}|=\left(7.29\times10^{-5}\text{ rad s}^{-1}\right)^2\left(6,370,000\text{ m}\right)=3.39\times10^{-2}\text{ m/s}^2$$ That's at the equator, where the force is at its greatest. The planet would need to spin about 17 times as fast or have a radius 289 times as large in order to have $|\mathbf{a}|=g$. It could spin at about 10 times Earth's speed and generate Martian-level surface gravity, though, which would be decently suitable for humans. Apparently, the fastest spinning exoplanet known spins at roughly three times Earth's speed. That means that to generate Martian gravity, the planet would have to have a radius about 11 to 12 times that of Earth - making it the size of Jupiter! 

However, if you did mean volume, and not mass (and thus were ignoring the strict definition of a dwarf planet), then things may be a bit different. 

Let's start with a simplified model, namely, a Gaussian plume. This means that the concentration of the material, $C$, is $$C(x,y,z)=\frac{Q}{2\pi U\sigma_y\sigma_z}\exp\left(-\frac{y^2}{2\sigma_y^2}\right)\left[\exp\left(-\frac{(z-H)^2}{2\sigma_z^2}\right)+\exp\left(-\frac{(z+H)^2}{2\sigma_z^2}\right)\right]$$ where $$\sigma_y=\sqrt{2Dy\frac{x}{U}},\quad\sigma_z=\sqrt{2Dz\frac{x}{U}}$$ and 

It has been conjectured that there is dust at these Lagrange points, called Kordylewski clouds. They are quite insubstantial and not at all dense; in fact, they are extremely hard to observe from Earth and their existence has not been definitely proven. Indeed, evidence for them is quite slim. The clouds might also be in an unstable orbit, again because of outside perturbations. You can find a mention of the clouds here, though they are not referred to by name. 

There will be little difference. The lower atmospheres are the same. Let's assume that the atmospheric pressure, $P$, follows a simple exponential scale height model: $$P=P_0\exp\left(-\frac{z}{H}\right)$$ where $P_0$ is the pressure at ground level, $z$ is altitude, and $H$ is the scale height, given by $$H\equiv\frac{kT}{Mg}\propto\frac{1}{g}$$ We can then write $$P=P_0\exp\left(-\frac{zM}{kT}g\right),\quad P'=P_0'\exp\left(-\frac{zM}{kT}g'\right)=P_0'\exp\left(-\frac{zM}{kT}0.85g\right)$$ Therefore, if we set $P_0'=P_0$, $$\frac{P}{P'}=\frac{\exp\left(-\frac{zM}{kT}g\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{zM}{kT}0.85g\right)}=\frac{\exp\left(C\right)}{\exp\left(0.85C\right)}=\exp\left(0.15C\right)$$ where $$C\equiv-\frac{zMg}{kT}=-\frac{z}{H}$$ For $C=0$, at the surface, $P=P'$. For $C\approx-1$ - near an altitude of $8500\text{ m}$, the scale height on Earth - $P\approx0.367P'$. That's a difference of a factor of $3$! Even 1 km in the air, where $C\approx-0.118$, $P=0.889P'$. This assumes two things: 

The red line denotes the outermost stable S-type orbit, and the grey areas denote the habitable zone. The stars are shown in black. Using their analysis, they were able to show that only the secondary star can host planets in stable S-type orbits in its habitable zone, because the primary star’s maximum stable orbit is inside the inner edge of the habitable zone. Now that we seem to have looked at the limits of orbits, let’s take a look at what you’re actually likely to find in a binary star system. Quintana & Lissauer (2007) is a good start, in terms of terrestrial planet formation. Here’s a quick summary: 

Another method is to find a set of letters - may it be a dipthong, a few consonants, or just a random combination - and use it in different names, possibly as a prefix or suffix. Again, drawing on Tolkien's work: 

So western China might not have a lot of cities, while eastern China will. I'd estimate perhaps 1.5 cities per major river, and 10 cities per length of the east coast of the United States (2,000 miles, give or take. From here, 

Periods of rotation and revolution Now, Kepler's third law states that the length of a planet's orbital period ($P$) is related to its semi-major axis ($a$) and the mass of its parent star ($M_*$): $$P^2=\frac{a^3}{M_*}$$ Now, we assumed above that $a$ doubles and $M_*$ is approximately cut in half. Therefore, we can see that the new period of revolution is four years. Now, there shouldn't be a significant change in the period of the planet's day, because that would involve a change in its rotational angular momentum. There's no source for it to offload its angular momentum to, and as its mass and radius will remain the same, so will the length of one day. The one way this could change would be if it has a moon - like Earth does. Over time, tidal forces transfer angular momentum from the planet to the moon, slowing its rotation. You haven't stated whether or not a moon exists; for simplicity, I'll assume one doesn't. Possible adaptations I don't see any significant changes happening here. If the length of a day remains the same, then the only difference is that the year has doubled, which doesn't seem terribly absurd. The seasons - such as they are - will also be twice as long, although with arguably no surface life, the change could be tough to see. The only effect this would have on life here would be that the available heat reservoir for thermosynthesis would oscillate over a longer period. That change, though, should be slim, and certainly wouldn't endanger life. 

Find orphans, preferably tweens - the older the better. There must be some somewhere on the ship. If not, a truly evil parent-wannabe could make children orphans via murder, but that's just heartless. Alternatively, look for kids whose parents are willing to give them up. Raise the kids. Again, the older, the better. The older ones will be able to handle themselves, so it's not going to be incredibly challenging to take on another teen - at least, not as hard as it would be to adopt a newborn baby. Profit. 

In response to the (insightful) comments below by Cragor and Oldcat: Okay, so the dark matter comparison has some flaws. I tried to ignore them and keep this almost entirely science-based, but I realized there's no way to do this well, so I'll abandon that strategy for this last bit. Although it's actually still based on science. The trouble lies in the krad matter's absorption of photons. There's going to be energy transfer, and that means the matter is going to heat up, thereby radiating heat. That's a problem. The solution lies in quarks. Quarks are confined within hadrons - they can never escape. Add more energy, and you end up producing more quarks (and the same number of anti-quarks). They same principle could be at work here. Add energy to a particle of this matter, and a new particle is created. 

The equation for the power emitted by a laser beam at a distance in a circle of radius $r$ at a distance $z$ where the beam diameter is $w(z)$ is $$P(r,z)=\frac{1}{2}\pi I_0w_0^2\left(1-e^{-2r^2/w^2(z)}\right)$$ where $I_0$ is the initial intensity and $w_0$ is the initial beam diameter (see these course notes). If we assume that the entire diameter of the beam hits the target, then we can set $r=w(z)$ and get $$P=\frac{1}{2}\pi I_0w_0^2\left(1-e^{-2}\right)$$ We could write $I_0$ as a function of the electric field amplitude $E$ and the characteristic impedance $\eta$ (see this presentation), but it might be better to just work off of numbers. At any rate, this equation assumes that all of the beam hits the target, which isn't necessarily the case. Were we to use the world's most powerful laser, we could get around 1.3$\times$1015 watts of power - for half of a trillionth of a second. Let's think about beam divergence, and the Rayleigh length. This is the value of $z$ for which $w(z)=2w_0$. It is given by $$z_R=\frac{\pi w_0^2}{\lambda}$$ The NIF laser operates at a wavelength of 351 nm (Haynam et al. (2007)), with all 192 beams being focused through a hole less than 1 mm in diameter. Assuming that our lasers have beam widths of about this much, then we have a $z_R$ of ~22 meters. That's not good. However, this is because the beams must be so small. The Boeing YAL-1 could have been effective at up to 300 kilometers (see a summary of a report). So if we up the power, then we could in theory get results more like the ones seen at NIF - really, really explosive. A couple hundred kilometers should be achievable. Laser shielding is a whole different problem. At these energies, there's not a whole lot that can stop these lasers. Most things will catch fire or blow up (or both). Heck, that's why the NIF uses them! One option is to use a shield of "trash" - basically, laser cannon fodder. It gradually gets eaten away by laser attacks. Problems: 

It appears that most places would have normal day/night cycles. Some places on the inner edge may never see day if $R$ is small, but if $R$ is big - and I think this is likely - things should be relatively normal. Although the sky would consist of the other side of the planet. 

Let's go back 10,000-12,000 years, when humans have yet to make strides in basic machines. In our world, the invention of the wheel makes things easy to move, starting a transportation revolution. This will eventually lead to new technologies, and eventually the rise of more complicated machines. What if the wheel was never invented? In this world, humans discover a gel-like substance that, when put on an object, immediately reduces friction. All of a sudden, pushing a boulder across a grassy field is more like pushing a boulder across an icy pond - but even easier. The effects of friction can be almost totally neglected. This leads to a different type of transportation revolution. All of a sudden, the coolest new way to get around is in large sleds with their undersides coated with this gel. Soon, horses are domesticated - way ahead of schedule - as it becomes clear that putting them side by side in front of a sled is a great way to pull heavy loads. Will this society ever be motivated to invent the wheel (assuming that pulleys are created not out of axles, but out of gel-coated blocks)? Related points can be found in In a society of flying beings, would the wheel ever be invented?, especially related to pulleys and the application of the wheel to transportation.
