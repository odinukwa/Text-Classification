Strictly responding to the "business" aspect: I believe that one way or another the employee should go. We are in the case where we cannot have a proper functional working relationship. In this cases one should go. Because of the company's size (small/middle), a transfer to another department "far-away" from you is not possible, so leaving is the only option. Because the owner cannot leave, the employee should go. Additionally you offer employment to a big number of people and living with extra stress from a single person within your working life might have an effect to the rest of the people working there (if this causes issues to company's performance). For the benefit of the whole versus one person, I believe he should go. 

I believe that the term has been diluted a lot in the recent years because of hype. It has to do with what you define as a Startup. One definition, paraphrasing Steve Blank, is that a startup is a "temporary organization in search for a business model", so one you have stabilized your business model, you are no longer a startup. In theory this is irrelevant to time, but if you are searching for a business model for 10 years... People also confuse start-ups (introducing something new) with companies that start-up, like use a traditional bakery as an example. This happens a lot recently that people are more interested in entrepreneurship and also because there is some overlap. In that case I would say that a traditional business leaves the starting-up phase once things have stabilized/matured (establish a presence, clientele etc), let's say when the rate of change drops. Again 10 years are a lot, maybe not for space/pharmaceutical. In any case in order to have a "right" answer, we need to look for how people define "startup". Counter example: try to market your company a startup in order to attract specific talent, while it is not. Additional material: A taxonomy of startups, from Blank mentioned above: Steve Blank: The 6 Types of Startups. 

It is a "corner case" because of the size of the company, where titles moreover C-type ones are tricky. Eg if there is one accountant is he a CFO? I would add the fact that the company is a small one and something that you do on the side in an additional sentence next to the company on the CV. 

I have read numerous questions that do not address this specifically. In any case, I have received an invitation to interview but not interviewed yet, attempted reasonable contact and have waited a reasonable amount of time. See comments below where I refute claims of duplication. BACKGROUND: I received a request from an internal recruiter for a phone interview and a time to do so. I responded the next day, suggesting that day was not good and opened up my availability for the next several days as well as offred up a suggested set time the day after the next. I received no response. As the suggested time approached without response, I called the recruiter and wanted to make sure I had not missed something so I could be available. He was unclear, but implied he hadn't heard from the person doing the interview, who is a technical supervisor not a hiring manager. I waited a week or so and received no response. I sent one more followup politely requesting more information either way. THE QUESTIONS ARE: In the above scenario, 1.) do I only continue to try and contact the unresponsive recruiter and 2.) should I only use email or go to phone calls with them? 3.) How long should I wait to escalate and contact the supervisor? 4.) Should I contact the supervisor by email, phone or a message with the receptionist? CLOSING NOTES: Yes, I already know to continue on in the meantime. Yes, I would still work for them after not receiving a reply. Yes, I know they hired a recruiter to schedule interviews as part of their duties so that the supervisor wouldn't have to deal with candidates. Also, the position is still listed and there is no closing date. The original invitation implied a desire to schedule the interview as soon as possible (but not urgently). I am not sure if the recent elections here in the U.S. have affected the process or not. 

Well I really messed up: A small batch of custom resumes were perfect and typo free, however, they were not converted to PDF correctly and as a result there was additional personal information from another document included at the bottom of the resume. The mistake is obvious and will most likely result in receiving no call backs from these employers; this field is unforgiving of these types of errors that scream incompetence. My question is that while there is nothing I can do to correct the mistake and become a "serious candidate", I would like to at least get the sloppy resume updated in their database, so as to remove the personal information as well as hopefully prevent it from being seen in the future, in case I have later dealings with these companies. Is a short letter saying "I made a mistake and would appreciate it if they could replace the faulty resume with the correct one" appropriate or understandbale? Please note that these resumes were emailed, not uploaded into a web-based database (otherwise I would just update it myself). Will an HR Manager even do this? Anything else to add in order to soften the blow... like a note taking responsibility for the mistake and an apology for the inconvenience? 

My take is that your experience does not increase or reduce employability, it changes it: for some places you will be more employable for some others less. 

I had a related feedback at some time in the past with a related issue: Being in a small company usually involves more interaction with everyone, being able to skip hierarchies and generally an efficiency vs protocol approach. That's for the soft skills. Similarly for the technical skills, it is more about breadth then depth. It seems that in small places a person who "Gets things done" is more appropriate, while in bigger places there is a need that needs a specialist, eg: "person with X years on experience on Y". I'd suggest to mention that you are aware of this in the cover letter and that you are willing to work on crossing that chasm. This will signal to the HR person that you are aware of the situation. Now they can be thinking based on the number of CVs that they receive that you are testing the waters or something like that. 

It is not necessary the language barrier but what is expected from each position and what the mentality of a business culture is. This is as stated in other answers more important as you are becoming more managerial. What makes a good manager in Britain is different than in Australia even if both countries are linguistically almost identical. I am one of the most extreme cases I know, I have done historically really well in US based companies, very bad at UK based ones. If some self-promotion is allowed I've posted my experiences here: $URL$ How to mitigate this: As other suggestions, you can easily move if not managerial which translates either in Jr/Sr positions. Another way is to try to be "the" expert on a very specific field, say UX for wearable devices, AI for electric cars (I made these up). Then you will move around because of your skills in that field. Another option is the one described in the book "Remote". Find employers who will allow you to work remotely. They are becoming more and more in the software industry as Silicon Valley becomes progressively more saturated. A friend is working in one of them and he only needs to be in the US for a yearly event and in a place somewhere else for another one. Maybe you want to find one of these companies, join start relocating after a couple of years. 

The price of rent in the area of a potential employer has increased dramatically without regard to the rest of the state and surrounding areas outside reasonable driving distance. In fact, it appears the trend will continue and I will be looking at an entirely different situation in as little as 1-2 years. Is it appropriate to mention this noticeable trend during salary negotiations, and how they dealt with this situation in order to continue competing for talent? Surely, they want to keep a happy employee that is focused on their work instead of rent. *From my initial research, there has not been an increase in salaries for this area when compared to others outside. **Assume that relocation to the area will be necessary, and commuting is not an option. UPDATE: In response to the answers bearing similarities to the answers in this question, I am not asking a company to accommodate my personal needs regardless of the market rate for the local area. I am well aware that my value is the basis for their salary offer. What I am asking about is referencing an anomalous situation which has been reported by local newspapers. 

I had always planned on focusing on my studies until senior year and obtaining at least one year of work experience in my field before graduating to set me apart. Due to a number of factors, I am now ready to graduate but have not yet had employment in my field; this is due to outside matters and not inability to find work. I believe it is in my best interest to begin working before graduation, because companies may more readily hire cheaper workers and I may be allowed a more pleasant learning curve as I start out. I do not want to enter the workforce full time and be let go because I didn't judge my capabilities correctly. As a graduate I will also be competing for larger salary numbers against others who will most likely have this industry experience. 

Finances/Tuition/Living Expenses aside, for the reasons stated above, would it be wise to delay graduating in order to work for an extra semester? Will this experience allow one to apply after graduation as a "Level I" candidate instead of "Entry Level", thereby significantly raising their salary?
