When you fit toe clips to your pedals, that spike is there to help you flip the pedal over so the clip is on the top. The pedals have an up and down orientation when toeclips are fitted. 

This page on wikipedia lists the UCI Pro teams and has a column listing their Country. It is sourced from this page on the UCI official site. What significance does this hold? Clearly each team doesn't have an obligation to only include riders from that country. What is the source of the association between teams and countries? 

I bought a Campagnolo master link (this one) for use with my Campy 10 speed chain. When it's not on a chain, it joins up and clicks into place and all is well. However, when I try to fit it around the chain link the pin doesn't seem to go through far enough to allow the groove in the pin to 'engage' with the opposite groove. Based on the packet it seems there are different pin lengths. How do I know what pin length I should aim to get to fit my chain? Are there different 'standard' lengths for Campy chains? 

When the tour riders are doing time trials, they ride their super aerodynamic, aggressively positioned bikes for maximum efficiency. However, on normal stages, there are many cyclists who could also benefit from the greater aerodynamic efficiency. Any riders at the front of the peleton or any cyclists on the breakaway would gain a great deal from having their TT bikes. I can't even think of any downsides, given that with electronic gears they can have duplicate shifter buttons on the aero bars and the bullhorns. Why don't they use their TT bikes all the time? 

I've found a number of articles saying there is no advantage in having the cleat under the ball of your foot as opposed to further back towards the arch. The reasoning is that the calf muscle is not suited for endurance efforts and shouldn't be overused while cycling. 

If you want to give them a try, this tyre from tannus would fit your bike. The item code WMI702H or WMI702S would both fit, but be a bit narrower than your existing tyre (32 rather than 38). 

If you're at home, use a floor pump. They are very easy to use and have a gauge so you can measure the pressure. 

Go to Strava.com Register or sign in Click on "Explore" menu Find the region you're interested in using the search box. The map will then show all segments registered in Strava. There is a slider along the top that allows you to filter out various categories, so you can see just categorised climbs. 

Seriously, that's all it comes down to. Think about what you'll do if you get a flat anywhere along your commute and how much of an inconvenience it is. Then compare that to the inconvenience you experience from carrying spares and fixing a flat on the road. 

My bike has 2009 Campagnolo Veloce 10 speed drivetrain. I recently changed the cassette (still Veloce 10 speed) and chain (campagnolo Record 10 speed). I assumed the fact that the chain was in the Record series wouldn't matter since it's still 10 speed. However, I can't get the new setup to shift well. If I tune it so that it downshifts smoothly, it's noisy while pedaling (unless I exert a small force on the upshift lever). If I tune it so there's no noise while riding, it won't downshift properly. Further reading of the Record chain says it's "Ultra narrow" so I'm wondering if that chain isn't compatible with the rest of the Veloce drivetrain. Is my issue adjustment or compatibility? 

Transition lenses! After riding for years with various sunnies and cycling glasses with interchangeable lenses I got sick of having to carry around multiple lenses and changing them during the ride. Recently, I got a pair of Oakley Fives with transition lenses. They are brilliant. No more need for changing lenses, they are always the right level of shading and it's just so convenient. I only got the fives because they were pretty cheap and they suited my face. Plenty of sports frames can handle transition lenses. 

I'm riding with Shimano SD66 sandals. They are awesome sandals and it's so comfortable riding without worrying about socks and shoes. I'm using Shimano pedals. I'm getting a squeaking sound, mainly from one shoe/pedal at the top of the power stroke. I'm almost certain it's from the shoe/pedal because just adjusting the angle of my foot a little (inside the play allowed by the cleat/pedal) makes the noise stop. I'm assuming that the shoe and pedal are deforming/conforming to each other and have started to rub at the most common positioning. I'd normally look at lubricating, but don't want to use grease as that will track through my house and office. Any other thoughts? 

Thanks for the suggestions. If there is a bulge in the rim can I fix it, or do I need to replace it? 

I've occasionally had this when the drive side axle was slipping in the drop out. When enough torque was applied to the pedals the axle moved just enough that the front of the tyre was rubbing on the inside of the left chain stay. You could check the paint there and see if there is any evidence of rubbing. If this is the problem, a chain tug would solve it. Also, how close are your brakes to the rims? Maybe a bit of flex is enough to cause the brake to rub. 

I ride an SE Lager. It's a pretty cheap and crappy bike. I've had to replace pretty much everything on it due to wear/breakage. The only area I haven't tackled is the bottom bracket. I can confidently remove/replace/tune all other parts of the bike, but I'm not sure what is involved in the bottom bracket. I'm pretty keen to just pull it apart and check it out, even if it doesn't need replacing right now, so that I'm confident I can do it when it does need replacing. Plus I'm curious and think it'd be fun :) According to the spec, the bottom bracket is "Euro cartidge sealed bearing w/Alloy Cups". This doesn't seem very informative to me. Questions: 

Most applications that claim to measure calories burned use a simple equation of your body weight, the time spent at the activity and a (very approximate) number of calories burned per time unit of the activity. I suspect that's where the different results come from. To get a better estimate of how much energy you have used I'd suggest a power meter. They give you an accurate measure of how much energy you have used. This can then be converted into calories burned, albeit with an estimation of your efficiency in converting calories to power on the bike. Power tap have a range of products that display calories burned. 

There's a product called cat ears (reviewed here) that claim to reduce wind noise. They attach to your helmet straps and disrupt the flow of wind. I've also found that headbands worn over the ears help a lot. Something like these are good. I even wear them in summer as they help stop sweat running into your eyes. 

I've had the same problem and it was infuriating. I took it to 3 different shops with varying levels of success. Eventually I found an excellent shop who spent about a week investigating and fixing. In the end they found creaks in: 

When the compression ring is placed on the steerer tube, there is slight gap between them. It's maybe a millimeter, although I don't have anything to measure that with here. Watching the movement carefully I'm quite confident that it's this gap that's causing the steerer tube to clonk around. 

It depends to what level you want to disassemble. For general cleaning your list is a good start. As you dig deeper though you'll also need: To service/adjust drivetrain 

Simple adjustment It may be that your brakes and gears are simply out of adjustment. The easiest way to confirm this would be to take it to your local bike store (LBS) and ask them for advice. Most stores are pretty friendly and helpful towards keen amateurs. If they advise that it's just adjustments they can do it themselves, or show you the adjustment screws so you can try it yourself. More significant work It may turn out that there is more work required, such as replacing brakes or gears. Also the chain, cassette and chainrings may need replacing. In this case I'd be very wary of investing too much money into the bike. Buying components individually is a lot more expensive than buying a complete bike. Plus making sure parts will fit can be confusing and unreliable. If there's much wrong with the bike I'd say it'd be cheaper to buy a new bike where you know that all the parts are at least compatible and in good condition. 

Fit prescription lenses and your focus is sorted These frames have a very wide range of vision I'd get transition lenses to handle various levels of light. This frame is light and strong. 

The trick is to use the strength in your legs plus leverage to lift the bike. It is so simple I can hang my bike up one handed. 

I can see a nut, but with the plastic cap extending into the cavity I can't get a socket in there. I need to remove the plastic somehow. Anyone have any ideas how to remove the cap and it's remnants? 

I was watching Stage 1 of the tour and the commentators said that it was 'risky' for Cav to wear a skin suit. As far as I'm aware, the benefits of a skinsuit are that it's lighter and more aero. The downsides are that there's no storage for gels/bars. However, surely he can get gels/bars from other riders in the team. Are there other downsides I'm not aware of? Why is it risky? 

It looks like your hub doesn't have lock nuts, so you don't have to worry about inner/outer lock nuts. You will need to get some better wrenches (cone wrenchs would be best because they are as narrow as the flats on your axle nuts) and then with a wrench on both 'ends' of the axle you'll be able to loosen them. 

Adding to the many excellent answers, riding a fixie is fun! I didn't get one for a long time because I thought I wouldn't ride it. But then once I got one I didn't ride anything else for 3 months. It is that much fun. Even on longer rides (up to 80km) I'd ride the fixie. You're so connected to the riding experience on a light, nimble bike. There's no need to be monitoring which gear you're in and which gear you need to select next to go up/down the next hill. There's never noise from the drivetrain. You're never between gears. You're always in the right gear and it's always rock solid! As a commuting bike a fixie is ideal (assuming you can manage any hills). 

I'm trying to remove my rear brake caliper to put a fender/mudguard clamp on. I've removed the rear nut and I assume the brake should then slide straight out. But it won't. It is definitely a little loose, it will rotate freely and has maybe 1mm of play, but even putting a reasonable amount of force on it, it will not slide out of the hole in the rear frame. What am I missing? I assume I don't need to unscrew the caliper out of the frame. Edit: Sorry about my woeful care of this question. I meant to put up some photos and explain in more detail, but didn't get around to it :( In the end I unscrewed the "rear" nut (closest to the front of the bike) a little and tapped it lightly with a wrench and the caliper did come out. Turns out it was just a very tight fit. Thanks! 

Tyre management is tricky. I also notice the gashes and cuts in the tyre. Also if you take your tyre off and look really closely (while bending the rubber back and forth) you'll find heaps of glass and metal embedded in the tyre. If you were really keen to extend the life of your tyres you can go through and pick out all the junk you can find. I personally replace my tyres when the frequency of punctures gets too high. Over time it happens more regularly until I get sick of it and buy new ones. If you want a longer lasting tyre, I've had good experience with Continental Gatorskins. I generally run 4000S's on the front for the amazing grip, and Gatorskins on the back for longer life. 

I think the times you're posting for the distances you're riding, especially on a touring bike are pretty reasonable. Professional athletes, or racers, will ride quicker, but for an amateur aiming for a century your times are fine. On a longer ride, you need more time for rest stops and food and nature breaks. A road bike will make you a little quicker, especially when you're riding into a headwind. It will also make the time spent more comfortable because you have more options to vary your position. Make sure you keep up your fluids, electrolytes and carbs. Sports drinks, energy gels, sports bars and glucose lollies can really help when you hit the wall, or 'bonk'. On long rides, you need to keep eating regularly, even if you don't feel hungry (sometimes even when you're sick of eating sugary foods). It's amazing the pick up you can get from eating some good fuel. Keep riding, keep training and the distance and time on the bike will be more achievable and comfortable. 

I know that some BMXs have left side drive. I actually found this out by accidentally ordering a left hand freewheel that was backwards on my single speed! I don't know if these cranks will work for you but it might be a place to look. Wikipedia describes left side drive here . JensonUSA have Sugino tandem crank arms sold separately.
