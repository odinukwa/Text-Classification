It is however perhaps worth noticing that the question is slightly misleading. The encryption used elsewhere in GSM and other mobile networks only applies to the radio interface between the mobile phone and the cell tower. Within the network, phone calls are generally not encrypted anywhere and in most countries, phone network operators are obligated to provide law agencies interfaces to intercept phone calls. 

The event took place in a housing complex for refugees on March 20th in Fagersjö, a suburb just outside Stockholm and received attention in main-stream media as well, e.g. in Dagens Nyheter, Aftonbladet, Expressen and SVT. The press release from the Stockholm Police is not published anymore, but can be found in Google's web cache. The perpetrator was a resident of the housing complex (so, most likely a refugee) and was arrested and accused of arson, damage to property, violence against enforcement officer, attempted violence against enforcement officer and disturbance. 

The calculation you're linking to assumes 20,000 hours of work during residency. According to Wikipedia's section on residency in the United States, the residency usually lasts for one year (state dependent) and the number of working hours is limited to 80 per week. That makes a maximum of 4,160 hours, which is not even close to the number used in the claim. 

Though the answers so far have done a good job of pointing out the numerical facts of the matter, the political context needs elaboration. The question cannot be answered alone by proving or disproving the stated fact, but by giving context to the things implied from this fact. At the time of the 2010 general election the government was reeling from the financial crisis of 2007-8. The Conservatives blamed the national debt on the Labour government. They claimed it was Labour spending which had triggered the crisis (and thus created much of the debt they inherited). This then formed the basis of Conservative strategy; they would cut public spending with a policy of austerity to reduce the deficit. However, it's more complicated than that. Firstly, they specified that they would cut the deficit, (not the debt) and this is an important distinction. Public debt being the total the government owes, and the deficit being the fact their revenue is negative: the difference between income and spending. Of course, one needs to fix the deficit before they can service the debt; but the Conservatives only pledged to improve the deficit. Secondly, their claim that the crisis was due to government spending was rebuked by senior civil servants, and plainly false. Before the crisis (as other answers point out) public debt was 35% of GDP, and this increased significantly after the government was forced to purchase large corporations which would otherwise have imploded - as the government feared a second great depression. The implication that Labour are better economically than Conservatives, owing to better public debt figures, is short-sighted or deceptive. It's true that under New Labour Britain enjoyed its longest economic boom. But this is less to do with their leadership and more to do with the economic climate. To understand this, we need to go back to the Winter of Discontent. In 1979 Margret Thatcher won the general election for the Conservative party, promising to end British socialism; hoping to reverse a prolonged period of economic disorder and decline. She liberalised the economy, selling off and closing state industries, and deregulating the financial sector. By the time of the 1997 general election the seeds of boom and bust sown by Thatcher in 1979 had blossomed. This was the high point of economic growth between two low points of economic decline. It's also worth noting that the issue is further complicated by another unstated fact. The present leader of the Labour party, Jeremy Corbyn, is an "old Labour" socialist, contrasting "new Labour" of 1997-2010. They had abandoned socialism and adopted Thatcherism. The Labour party of today is not ideologically consistent with the new Labour of the past... or even the Labour party just before Corbyn became leader. In conclusion, the stated fact is true, but any implication drawn from it is false. Labour's boom and bust, and the consequences for the Conservative government which followed, were because of an economic environment independent of their leadership. It was a high growth environment back then, which enabled relatively low public debt. Additionally the implication that the Labour party was better, so we should have a Labour government now, is a deceptive supposition, because the Labour party of today is not the same as then. 

What you see in the video is the АЛСН (автоматическая локомотивная сигнализация непрерывного действия) signal, a system for automatic train control used in the ex-Soviet states. Due to the low signalling speed, you can even read the signal from the pulsating bulb, which is here "code Z" (three long pulses separated by short breaks) basically telling a train on the track that the next signal will be green. Drawing any current from the rails (as done in the video) is very likely to disturb the reception of the signal in nearby trains. A lack of signal on the rails is interpreted by the running stock as if the next signal is "red" and would force nearby trains to stop. 

First, it is important to remember that food labeling is not a particularly exact science. Unless completely artificially manufactured, most food is anyway subject to regional or seasonal variations in energy content. Food labeling regulations usually define carbohydrates and protein to have an energy density of 4 kcal/g and fat to have 9 kcal/g. The US regulations can be found here, the EU regulations is here and other countries are likely to operate with the same numbers. Assuming that "storage fat" in your quote is a colloquial expression for adipose tissue, the next important question is the fat content of adipose tissue. The exact composition of adipose tissue varies significantly between persons, but I've often seen the number 87% be used for the average lipid (fat) content. This number is e.g. used in Wikipedia's article on adipose tissue, it's also used in this book and this article, but without any reference to a source for this number. When examining scientific research, most publications quote much lower numbers, e.g. George L. Baker: Human Adipose Tissue Composition and Age, finding the lipid content to be between 40% and 75%: 

According to the UCR data from the period 1990 to 1999, 290 law enforcement officers were killed while wearing protective armor (see exhibit 11). Of those officers 160 (55.2 percent) were killed by gunshot wounds to the head; 101 (34.8 percent) died as a result of gunshot wounds to the upper torso; 18 (6.2 percent) died as a result of gunshot wounds below the waist; 5 (1.7 percent) were struck by automobiles; 2 (0.7 percent) were stabbed; and 4 (1.4 percent) died by other means. 

Smarter Switches Install motion-detecting switches that turn off lights when a room is empty. CPU Myth Shut down your PC if it will be idle more than 2 hours. The idea that turning a computer off and on shortens its life is a relic of the mainframe era. Bright Idea Use compact fluorescent bulbs. New models illuminate just as well as incandescents -- and operate on just over one quarter of the power. Cold Truth Keep your refrigerator or freezer full; it operates more efficiently that way. Low on food? Keep a container of ice in the freezer. 

This question is difficult to answer, partly because different nations record demographic data at different times and in different ways, and partly because some don't even bother. France for one doesn't record its citizens ethnicity, so we don't know how many French citizens are ethnically French. There are estimates of course, so we can know roughly, but not precisely. But then there's even more problems when it comes to the new world, where the question of whiteness becomes more cultural and less obvious. How do we define whiteness? How do we define non-whiteness? Barack Obama has a black father and white mother, and identifies as, and is identified as, black. It seems in north America whiteness is exclusive, while in Latin America this is less so. 47% of Brazilians identify as white, though most Brazilians have a colourful and diverse ancestry. This, incidentally, is part of why Spain's colonial empire fell apart. It became impossible to enforce the casta system after a few generations of blacks, natives, whites, and others blending their ancestries. So how we're meant to make heads or tails of it is anyone's guess. For simplicity we're going to just go on self identification and census records. Still, the question remains. What is whiteness? I'm going to assume that whiteness means European ancestry, and so (minus colonies) it stops at the straights of Gibraltar, Bosporus, Caucuses, and Urals. Again, the best we can get is rough estimates. If we go on the largest ethnic groups, including significant white minorities, then it seems that around 90% of most EU states are white, while Russia is 80% white. So, this would mean that given the EU's population of 510m, plus Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus' combined of about 200m, assuming Russia 80% white, while Ukraine and Belarus 90%... leaves us with a grand total of about 624m white Europeans. Outside of Europe, from the populations of former colonies, this data suggests the total white population is about 480m. So the total white population of the world is roughly speaking 1,102m. Now, I am going to assume that "white women" basically translates as "females of majority European ancestry". And I'm going to assume a 50-50 gender split, which isn't going to be exactly true, but close enough. So in that case we're left with a world population of white females of roughly 550m. Out of a world population which is presently 7,400m. This means that we can estimate that 7-8% of the world's population are "white women". In conclusion and according to the stated assumptions: almost double the initial figure, but still a very small group against the world population. And yet to imply five hundred million people aren't numerous enough to support "diversity" (of what?), I don't know. That's still a lot of people, even if a small proportion of the whole.
