Magnetic dart gun. Use magnetic rings to pull the dart to speed. No other barrel exists except the magnets so that air pressure can't build up anywhere. The dart is probably more like a long thin bullet. Since the pressures on the "Bullet" are less jarring and better distributed than a gunpowder accelerated round, the bullet could more easily be made to deform/shatter on impact so that it wouldn't just slide through the body cleanly. The bullet could be any length--from a sewing needle up to the length of a knitting needle--with tiny dart-like fins at the back to keep it pointed in the right direction (they could also impart spin). As long as it shattered on impact and had some weight it would be terribly deadly. If a slower speed (Subsonic) were desired, it could have active guidance allowing it to be fired on an arc. A long thin slow sharp bullet could penetrate the body and shatter or even explode inside using the body's mass as a muffler... 

All the in plain site answers have the same problem--once they spot YOU, you are done for--they will follow you via satellite, video & aircraft and if they want you bad enough, your lair will be found. I'd say the ONLY safe place might be underwater--if you could make it to the sea I don't think it would be as easy to follow you. Anti-sonar tech might make you amazingly hard to find if you are deep enough, the ocean is too big to scour every inch. The only other place I could see is if you had enough money and had a legitimate front you might be able to buy a section of land from one of the many governments around the world. I'm a little surprised nobody has done that yet--just buy a small city-state. You could contract with that government for military defense as well which might be enough deterrent to keep other governments from wiping you out. 

If they developed a "Distributed" storage system they would probably be able to preserve and pass down memories so why would they record them... In fact the entire concepts of mortality and individuality may not occur to them since everything an individual ever did is completely preserved and shared. This leads to some really interesting possibilities... You could probably spend a lifetime just delving through memories instead of creating your own. Maybe this is why we didn't evolve this way :) If a good deal of your race was wiped out or a group separated by enough space they would probably start to lose random memories which would be a really weird concept to a race that has every memory available at any time. 

There are a couple quantum theories of interest.... The first is that all information is preserved which means that you could at least calculate any previous state of the universe from any future state, so you could figure out pretty much where everything was including every atom in a person's body... However, another aspect is quantum state: Matter has various qualities that are un-measurable.. This does not mean it's difficult to measure, it means that the information does not exist in our universe. One example of this is how long it takes for a radioactive atom to decay--which is why decay is stated as an approximated half-life instead of a specific amount of time. So these two pieces of data lead me to believe that you could reproduce an approximate physical state, possibly even down to the molecule or maybe atom, but could not reproduce the exact quantum state. This last bit is more important than you'd think--every time a neuron decides to fire or not in your brain it is adding a little bit of this quantum state into the decision. It's like a super-computer built with each CPU operation adding in a little completely random factor so that even if you re-created the computer, program and data bit-for-bit the output of your program would still deviate every time. Because of this I don't think it would be possible to get the exact same behavior even if you could reproduce the physical state exactly--at least not from within our current universe/reality/dimension/??. 

First of all, I have not seen the show, only read the comics. In that scenario, there are four very important things to know about the zombie apocalypse. 

The best course of action, in this case for you, is to invent something. Throughout history, there has been many very complicated inventions, like computers, cellphones, cars, etc. Those inventions, even if you know about them, you wouldn't be able to create them from scratch if you never studied them in the present. On the other hand, some inventions are literally just a very good idea. If you know it's possible, it might take you a few hours or a few years, but you can make it. For example, if you traveled to the VERY distant past, you'd be able to "invent" fire, wheels, and even more advanced objects like boats and bicycles. In 1317, honestly the biggest thing that comes to mind that wasn't invented yet but is still simple enough that you could figure it out, is the printing press. It is a fairly complicated machine, but the "how it works" part is simple enough that your character definitely understands it without having done specific studies. So he could probably make it work within months, or years if many events slow him down. The goal is basically to invent something that would leave a HUGE impact in the future (inventing the printing press one century earlier would definitely change the world). So you find something that would change history a lot, so there is absolutely no way you can be mistaken about "did history change?", but is still simple enough that it is believable a random guy from 2017 would be able to make it from scratch without plans. Then, if you are in a stable time-loop type of world, something will prevent you inventing it or making it public. Maybe events out of your control keep stopping you from building it (natural disasters, vandalism, etc). Maybe you get killed before completing it and nobody knows what that half-machine in your workshop was supposed to be. Maybe you get kidnapped by a guy who sees the potential of your machine, steals it, and tries to force you to give its secret. Then plot twist, that guy was Gutenberg's grandfather and it took them two generations to figure out how to complete this half-machine they stole from you. The possibilities are endless. If you succeed at making your printing press, and making it public enough that no reasonable event could wipe out all traces and memories of its existence within a hundred years, you know you are either in a "Alternate timeline" or "you can change the past" situation. The question is now: How do you know all those things that stopped your invention weren't just bad luck? The answer is: you don't. You have to rely on math for this. Imagine a random number generator, which gives you a random number between 0 and 9 every time you ask. The first time it gives you 4. Sounds pretty fair. Then you get a 4 again. Having twice the same number in a row had a 10% chance of happening, this is Lucky. Then you get another 4. Now it was 1/100, what a coincidence! Then another. Then another. Then another. At some point, it sounds like the machine isn't really random. There is still a very small chance it was only luck, but after getting 20 4s in a row, which had a chance of 1/10000000000000000000, you can pretty much say that it's not random. You can never be sure, but you can be pretty confident. The same goes for your attempts. If a random group of kids break in your workshop and destroy the machine, that's possible. If the village gets flooded and you lose all your work, that's possible. If your house burns down and you have to start over, that's possible. But every time you see a somewhat-reasonable event that happens to ruin or seriously set back your invention, it could be complete luck, but at some point you have to decide "yeah, having all those events in a row is pretty unlikely. I guess it's not just bad luck after all". You won't have 100% certainty, but I think 99.99999% would be enough for you. This idea also had a great advantage. If you don't succeed at ever going back to your 2017, you will most likely become rich and famous in the 14th century, and be in most history books later on. That's pretty significant. 

Flexibility with timing. You could have the conversion take a dozen feedings over the course of a week, or three feedings over the course of a night. You can even make it take longer for stronger or "hardier" humans. It keeps the nature of vampirism obscure. This feeding method could be caused by virus which requires a weak host in order to take hold, or it could be a mystical curse which requires that the human's soul be weakened. It could arise by chance. If any human might turn after repeated feedings, it's imaginable that the first vampire[s] might have captured and fed on ancient humans as cattle, and passed on their affliction by accident. It gives a lot of room for tension. A character could have a longer period of time to worry about conversion, wait for rescue, or plot an escape. 

Can this feat be performed without invoking magic? Yes and no. Sufficiently Advanced Technology is Indistinguishable from Magic: If you showed a demonstration of Quantum Levitation to a medieval human, they would probably conclude that it was magic because they have no frame of reference for how such a thing could be possible within the realm of physical law. Except the alien's feat from the question amplifies the problem incalculably: a medieval human is still human, and possessed of roughly equivalent intelligence to a modern human--lacking only education and experience. Conversely, the aliens may be able to individually comprehend principles beyond even the cumulative capabilities of all humans throughout history. So instantly moving an entire galaxy would appear to be magical to most modern humans. But, if the aliens wanted to demonstrate their technical prowess, rather than claim any kind of supernatural ability, then they've got two avenues: 

First, I'll try to define that "internal harmony" requirement a bit, so I can use it to build the faction motivations: Internal Harmony: The angels are only able to uplift organisms with the appropriate "harmony". This may include extreme selflessness (willing to let oneself be subsumed by a higher power, for the sake of a greater good), or extreme faith (truly believing in the righteousness of the Source, without a hint of subconscious doubt). Disharmony: The higher realms would all be harmonious, but of increasing complexity. Conversely, the lowest realms (our universe, for example), would be chaotic messes. Our universe is brutally hostile to all forms of organic life. So, only a particularly lucky situation would result in complex organisms...and only the most savagely cunning species would survive to evolve sapience. From the Angels' perspective, humans would embody all of the things an angel cannot be. Don't Drink the Local Tap-Water: Watchers would be programmed with the same "internal harmony" of the Angels, as the Angels would not be able to comprehend doing otherwise (they couldn't intentionally program something which could disobey orders from On High). As such, the Watchers wouldn't be explicitly forbidden from interbreeding with humans, because the Angels (and therefore the Watchers) have no concept of sexual attraction to humans. From the Angels' perspective, humans are--at best--psychopathic children. At worst, humans are barely-sentient bacteria. Watchers would initially view the idea of breeding with humans as being on par with bestiality, robbing the cradle, or taking advantage of the mentally ill. The First Sip of Tequila: The problem is, the Watchers possess biologically human brains, as those are the organs necessary to live down in the gutter-reality of our universe. Only an organ so chaotic can function in The Disharmony. Eventually, some of them would start to experience sexual attractions, either instinctively, or as learned behavior of watching humanity for countless years/decades/centuries/millenia. Without a specific order against interbreeding, some watchers might decide to interbreed solely out of temptation, or curiosity, or even out of a genuine desire to "think like a human" (as understanding humanity is their mission). The Hangover: After a few of the Seraphim (human/Watcher offspring) begin to exhibit superhuman abilities, the Angels would immediately attempt to ban all further interbreeding (implementing a hot patch on all current Watchers?) to avoid contaminating the experiment. Unfortunately, the Watchers themselves would be too disharmonious at this point, so the ban wouldn't implement reliably: free will would get in the way. Why would the Seraphim have superhuman abilities? The Watchers might be biologically human, but they were designed to be able to communicate with Angels who exist in a higher realm. They'd also be designed to lack any human frailties (old age, susceptibility to disease, etc). Their superhuman knowledge might also be genetic, which means that some of that information could be passed on to their offspring. Seraphim would be born with some or all of those capabilities, but stunted or warped. For instance, the "Angel Sense" might not be properly attuned to the Angel's realm, and would instead give the Seraphim a view of spacetime's fourth dimension-- seeing the future or the past (or both). They may even be able to hear other people's thoughts, or project their own thoughts into others' minds. Physically, a Seraphim might possess almost perfect regenerative capabilities, but still be susceptible to injury. The combination might allow them to constantly become stronger and more resilient over time (muscles growing stronger with use, bones breaking and healing more durably), until they're several centuries old, with a superhumanly powerful physique. Putting the Genie back in the Lamp: Once the first few Seraphim are born, the human species would be irrevocably changed. Once that Angel DNA is introduced to the gene pool, the superhuman traits would keep manifesting even if all the Watchers were recalled or destroyed. Over many generations, the abilities would become diluted with baseline human genes, resulting in people with very subtle superhuman abilities: prophetic dreams, uncanny empathy, Olympian strength and endurance, photographic memory, or almost instinctive knowledge of science or mathematics. Occasionally, an Atavism would occur: a throwback to Seraphim capabilities, or even an almost pure-Watcher (the result of two Seraphim mating, perhaps). The original Seraphim may also still roam the world, millenia after the Watchers have left, concealing powers which might have grown even stronger over time. EDIT: Burning Down the House: I'd forgotten to address the part of the original question regarding the high energy requirements of the superhuman abilities. I'll try to give a few ways for that requirement to fit in with my other recommendations.
