I don't think that any of them would have an advantage over corals when it comes to building reefs. Perhaps they could manage to build some, but it would be hard. Echinoderms Coral create coral reefs by secreting calcium carbonate[1]. Echinoderms have partial skeletons composed of calcite[2], which is, for our purposes, the same thing. Echinoderms can lose limbs ad regenerate them so it is possible that you could create structures with some of the skeletal material from disused limbs. A stretch? Yes. But not impossible. The thing is, echinoderms like to live on the seabed. This is not conducive to reef-building. The raw materials are there, but the ability to assemble them may not be. Bivalves Bivalves are also composed in part of calcium carbonate[3],1, like echinoderms and corals. They are, however - to quote Wikipedia - "sedentary", preferring to stay where they are on the seafloor. Once again, it appears like it would be difficult to create complex three-dimensional reef-like structures out of them. Barnacles Barnacles, too, do not move[4], meaning that their placement for reef-building must be crucial. That said, they grow en masse in large groups, making it especially easy for them to take over large areas. They can quickly cover an area in themselves. They are made of - yes, you guessed it - calcite, the same building material as corals. They seem to be the best bet so far to replace corals. Worms Worms have soft bodies, and are invertebrates. They would not be good reef-builders. 

Using Kepler's third law, I get $$a=\sqrt[3]{\frac{P^2G\times(M+M)}{4\pi^2}}=5.32\times10^4\text{ kilometers}$$ where $a$ is the semi-major axis, $P$ is the time it takes the planets to orbit each other, $G$ is the universal gravitational constant, and $M$ is the mass of one of the planets - one Earth mass. The result is a semi-major axis of about 10 times the radius of Earth; the separation is twice this amount. I'd call this possible, though there would be very strong tidal effects. Specifically, the tidal acceleration $a_t$ is treated as $$a_t\propto\frac{M}{D^3}$$ where $D$ is the separation, i.e. $2a$. The Earth is about 100 times the mass of the Moon, so that's an increase of about 100. Furthermore, the Moon orbits Earth at a distance of about 3.85$\times$105 kilometers, about 3.85 times this separation. Therefore, we get an increase in tidal acceleration of about 5700. That's a lot. 

While working on the world I talked about here, I decided to tweak one thing. Instead of having the group of aliens terraforming a planet be of the same species, I decided to have them be different species, from different planets and stellar systems, working together on the same giant groundbreaking project. The problem then becomes one of communication. Given that there are hundreds of billions of stars in the Milky Way, many of which have planets, many of which have life, many of which . . . you get the idea. There are going to be a lot of species in the galaxy, and many of them will be working together on this project. Chances are very good that their native languages will be completely different. Therefore, I need to have a lingua franca, as it were, a language that everyone in the galaxy can speak (this assumes that there are too many languages in the galaxy for a portable translator to understand, and that thereâ€™s no Babel fish to help). However, part of me doubts that this is going to be possible. 

Basic characteristics The system you're describing here may be a contact binary, where the two stars have come close enough to actually touch. These systems may actually be stable for millions (or even billions, in extreme cases) of years; the lifetime of the system as a whole - outside the contact binary period - will certainly be similar to the normal lifetimes of the individual stars. The components may be massive O-type stars (see VFTS 352), or even low-mass M dwarfs (see e.g. Qian et al. (2015)). In other words, they run the gamut on spectral types. The progenitor stars may be variable stars - not great for life, but maybe not that terrible. They'd likely be W Ursae Majoris variables, if the stars are of spectral types A through K, with periods of perhaps 0.25 to 1.0 days. The variations are not drastic, spanning less than one magnitude (i.e. less than a factor of 10). It's not clear whether or not life could adapt to such circumstances, but it's good that the variations are so short. The merger An interesting case to look at is KIC 9832227, a pair of stars not wholly unlike the Sun (one is a G-type star). The combined luminosity is about 3 solar luminosities. Interestingly, the stars are predicted to merge in about five years, in 2022. They are expected to produce a luminous red nova. This is what likely happened in the case of V1309 Scorpii, in 2008 (see e.g. Tylenda et al. (2011)). The system increased in luminosity by about 3.5 magnitudes for about six months before the main outburst, where it brightened by an additional 6.5 magnitudes - not great for life. It then subsided over the course of several years. I'm actually pretty confident that life could survive in this sort of a system during the main period of evolution. Changes in stellar activity shouldn't be too bad; variations of less than one magnitude over short time scales are almost certainly not problematic. However, the nova itself would likely be very bad - very bad indeed. Long-term effects Let's again look at V1309 Scorpii. In the period of slowly increasing brightness, the stars lost mass, possibly forming an excretion disk (the opposite of an accretion disk, in a sense). It is unknown how this disk will behave; it may dampen the star's luminosity by some amount. At any rate, the luminosity will be closer to the original value after some time; the system has already dropped in brightness considerably. It's possible that planets could form from the disk. This may be how some (though not all) pulsar planets form, and it could likely happen around the results of luminous red novas. Life has a fighting chance of starting anew. The long-term behavior and evolution of these systems is not well-known, so it's currently not possible - as far as I know - to rule this out. 

The Hollow Earth theory is/was a pseudoscientific idea that our world is actually on the inside of a large sphere. The "sky" points inward towards the center, where the "Sun" (a light source) is, while the "ground" points outward. Let's assume that we have a planet the size of Earth, except that it is a hollow Earth. In reality, it's simply an Earth-sized cavity inside a larger body, notably, some sort of artificial megastructure. I had assumed that said megastructure was spherical, but clearly I should have stated it explicitly, so I'll do so now. The structure will have spherical symmetry and be as uniform as possible. Is it possible to put a moon inside the sphere - somewhere between the central light source and the "ground" - and have it move in an "orbit" around the center? Would the moon crash into the ground, or would it be stable? I'm almost positive that the moon can't be as big as Earth's moon, but I don't know a reasonable size. I'm fine with anything bigger than, say, Janus or Epimetheus. 

Here we run into a problem. The Earth's magnetic field comes from the motion of fluids in the core. This idea is known as the dynamo theory. However, as Wikipedia states, 

Let's imagine that the organism causing the disease (a virus) has two states, depending on whether or not it's inside its host. State #1: Active In this state, the organism is inside the host. It's feeding on nutrients it finds and subsequently reproduces, sending its offspring or replicas throughout the host's body. When it's in this state, it needs nutrients X, Y, and Z to stay actively reproducing; these nutrients can only be found inside the host's living body. State #2: Dormant In this state, the organism is outside the host. It can no longer access nutrients X, Y, and Z, and so it can no longer reproduce (this goes along with the definition of a virus). Therefore, it goes into a state similar to hibernation - a low power mode, if you will. For this, it needs nutrient A, which is only found in the ambient atmosphere. If nutrient A is detected and nutrients X, Y, and Z are no longer detected, the organism goes into State #2. 

Serban Tanasa has the redshift calculations down pat, so I'll focus on what space would be like if your scenario was true.
