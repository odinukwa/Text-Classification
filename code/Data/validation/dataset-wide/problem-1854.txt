Bankruptcy will only be in issue for some background checks. If you were applying for a position where your financial condition was important, then a recent bankruptcy could be a negative factor. It will also depend on if they asked you to answer questions in advance. Some places ask you to provide a list of everyplace you have worked, and they want a list of all your credit cards, and loans. They may even ask if you have ever declared bankruptcy or defaulted on a loan. If they did ask you prior to the check, and you didn't tell them about it; then omitting it would be the bigger issue. They may or may not tell you why you failed. The decision is up to the employer, it isn't up to the person conducting the investigation. They might come back to you to explain any discrepancies found, or they may ask you to explain some confusing information. If it has been a while you can follow up. Some checks takes only a couple of days, others take months to complete. They should be able to give you a range of times it typically takes. 

Yes ask if there are any expectations. If it sounds like they have a difficult set of hurdles ask for more details. In some companies they expect you to finish one or more training classes during probation. Others expect certification is a process. Others only have a probationary period as a safety-net. With some companies you might not be treated as a permanent employee. They may limit your ability to receive full benefits, or your ability to transfer to another team while in the probationary period. So yes you should ask more details. You should even ask if there is a mandatory set of review meetings during the probationary period. 

In general these types of contracts are not used. If the position requires an extensive background check the company you hire for that service will be able to provide the required verbiage for any paperwork the applicant must sign. It is also unusual to record interviews for most positions. An exception would be a position where they are being evaluated on how they move and talk. Athletes, actors, news readers, and performers expect that they will be recorded. Others would view your desire to record the interview with skepticism. If you do insist on have formal pre-interview contracts you will have to get a lawyer involved to draft the contracts, otherwise they may not protect you from the things you are concerned about. 

Decline the offer quickly and politely, and tell them why you picked the other position. Unless their negotiated offer met all your stated criteria they knew there was a risk you would decline the offer. The recruiter is probably not that interested in maintaining a continuous relationship with you. They tried to fit you into an open position and was unable to do so. One of the following things happened or will happen: the company went with another of their candidates; the company went with a candidate represented by another recruiter; or the position remains unfilled. Rejecting an offer to stay in your current job means they may be able to convince you next time; moving to another company may take you off the market for years. If your new position fits you well, and you perform well, and the new company survives you will be off the market for years. They may keep you in their database to passively send you open positions, or they may add you to a tickler file to contact you in 6 months to see if you are open to moving again. You can always reach out to then if you ever want to leave the new company. 

First of all every potential employer expects that all people are interviewing at other places. This is almost 100% guaranteed if the person they are interviewing is unemployed. While the interviews are only one business day apart, the time to the next step may not be. I have seen decisions made the same day, or had them stall for a month. The question: "If you were offered this job, would you accept it?" is to determine your level of interest. It doesn't commit you to taking the job, or commit them to offering one. I am not sure even this type of question gets them the truth. I have never told the person interviewing me that there was no way I would take the job; and as a person interviewing potential applicants the only times I heard that they weren't interested were ones that there was clearly as mismatch. Feel no obligation to tell them about other interviews, and don't feel that you have to answer the question "If you were offered this job, would you accept it?" truthfully. If both companies make offers there are several questions on this site addressing that question such as How do I coordinate the process of pursuing multiple job opportunities at the same time? 

It looks like some of the employees have picked the second option. Now is the time for management to acknowledge that the email system for distributing critical changes is fatally flawed. So management has to find a way that employees can always pull-up the current official procedure. There are industries where they have to have the latest procedures followed: think nuclear power plants. 

If you really feel that this isn't for you, then start looking for a new job. But keep in mind that you have a job and you have no idea how long it will take to find a job. Keep working with this company until you find a replacement job. Of course potential employers will wonder why you are looking when you have only been with the new company a few days. Tell them you though the position was as a developer, but it is really as a tester. 

If you are seriously considering it send a lawyer to the meeting, but you don't enter their workspace. Or better yet have the meeting at your lawyers office. If they did make changes to the company by firing everybody involved in the earlier incident then you could request certain provisions: 

They will never notice. On the resume you don't have to: list your High School Graduation; Date of Birth; Schools you attended but transferred from; majors started. You have to put the date of birth and high school graduation date on a formal application, and background checking forms, but that is long after the initial review and interview. Many US college students take more than 4 years. They switch majors, or are undeclared at the start. They reason for the switch might even be for bad grades within the major. Other people take more than 4 years because they worked many hours to pay for school so only attempted 12 credits hours instead of 15. If it took longer because you were an intern at a relevant business or government facility, then put it down in the experience section. If it was working at the cafeteria, then you don't need to mention it. If somebody asks, just tell them. There is no shame, you looked at the data (your grades, major, and bank account) and changed courses of action. 

Yes it is OK to switch after an appraisal. Many people, at least when the economy was good, would leave if they didn't feel that they received a large enough raise. The fact they gave you an increase in pay doesn't require you to stay for another year. If the appraisal will result in a bonus, then you would be wise to stay long enough to get the bonus. They are rewarding you for your hard work. If you are planning on leaving you should make sure that you are not leaving any money or benefits on the table. Some companies give bonuses, or lump sum vacation on a set schedule. Also make sure that if the company paid for you to move, or for part of your schooling that you have met the minimum amount of time you agreed to stay. Some companies will want full or partial payback if you don't stay the required number of years. Once you receive the increase in salary, then use the new salary as the baseline for comparison. You should let potential employers know the new salary if they want to know what you currently earn. But be careful about estimating future salary, especially if this is your first review with the company. Unless you have a contract, there is no guaranteed minimum increase. So don't tell a potential employer that your current salary is X% higher, or you might price yourself out of a job. 

In some companies with a lot of locations they actually ask during the application process if there are other locations that you are willing to work. They do this so that you are in the pool of applicants not just for one store, but also the one a few miles away. In companies with franchises it is a little more complicated because they are separate companies. One owner may have one location, but the restaurant just down the road could be owned by somebody who has a dozen. Applying to more than one position/location is not a problem. Though if they are ready to offer you a position they will ask you to withdraw your other applications with the company. 

Always assume that when it comes to health care and insurance that everything will stop the moment you walk out the door. I have seen companies extend it to the end of the pay period, or the end of the month but there is no standard unless your state or national labor law addresses it. The company may also handle a reduction in force vs. quitting vs. getting fired differently. Sometimes it depends on the contract between the employer and the insurance company. It may even depend on if they are self-insuring or not. Always ask and get clarification as early a possible. I have seen employees in the United States not spend flexible spending accounts when they didn't realize that there was a deadline.
