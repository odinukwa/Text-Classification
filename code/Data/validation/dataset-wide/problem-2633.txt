Reading Speed it's really really valuable to learn speed reading so you can read more philosophy. reading a lot (and rereading) does matter. if you can't read philosophy at 500 or more words per minute, it will be hard to do as much as those who can. it's also valuable to be able to read using both text and audio so you can read books while going for a walk or driving or at the gym, etc. you can listen to ebooks using text to speech software such as $URL$ (you aren't limited to audio books) the most effective speed reading approach is called Rapid Serial Visual Presentation. here's a free web version to see what it is (it takes a while to learn and get good with it, but you may be able to use it around your normal reading speed immediately. you can do higher speeds with 2 or 3 words at a time instead of just 1, and some people also find 3-4 words at a time is easier initially): $URL$ learning how to skim well, skip around to the important parts of books, look up relevant parts in the index, etc, is also extremely valuable. good skimming can save even more time than speed reading. both speed reading and skimming can have major downsides if done badly. you can lose a lot of comprehension of the material. but if done with enough skill and good judgement, they can work for most material, and you can occasionally slow down as needed. (as you get better at it, you can slow down less often for less kinds of material.) and reading faster allows more rereads. if you can do 2-3 fast reads instead of 1 slow read of a book, that's usually better. or do 1 slow read and 2-3 fast reads instead of 2 slow reads – that's pretty much always better. and getting good at speed reading can improve your minimum reading speed too. Rest Regarding rest, knowledge workers like programmers typically do about 10-20 hours a week of really serious hard work. They spend the rest of the time answering emails, doing meetings, checking reddit, etc. Most people can do more temporarily but would burn out if they kept it up. People also tire from other types of thinking such as playing chess or reading difficult philosophy. Getting tired normal. People also like excuses for not doing much. So be careful! Some people are exceptional. The philosopher Karl Popper had a reputation for working long hours all the time and not doing much else. Try to be honest about how much rest you really need. The more you really like your work, the more it should energize and inspire you! If that isn't happening, maybe something's wrong. 

You say if yes, then the argument is circular, because we've assumed what we wanted to prove. Just to clarify, Anselm is trying to prove that God exists, not that existence is a greater quality, just making sure we're on the same page. It does not follow directly that because existence is a greater property that the greatest being must exist. In fact, (though I am no expert) I think the key here is something which was pointed out by Kant and echoed by many others, not to exhaust their entire point, but just to borrow, that existence is a unique property (or not a property at all if they have their way). In my opinion, apart from being contradictory, if a property at all, existence is the one thing we cannot give to the definition of a being (or anything else for that matter). I can define a purple, skinny jaberwocky with 5 toes and an affinity for blue cheese, but I cannot define him to exist in reality. It seems Anselm shared my sentiments as this is not what he has done. He set out to prove it, by saying that if the being does not exist, then an existent version can be imagined, and the imagined version would be greater, creating a contradiction, and if the proposition that God does not exist leads to a contradiction, it must be false and God exists. 

Is there a thing in my mind? Is that how it's phrased? I understand there is the definition of apple as a concept...is this what is in my mind? The definition doesn't include red though...Honestly I would have said that if there is a thing and I'm thinking about it, there are two different entities, there is the real thing that exists and there is the concept of it in my mind, but this doesn't seem to be correct. Can anyone please tell me what actually is in my mind? Is it called a concept? Thanking you in advance. 

there's mysticism here. a simulation of a human is a human. it's the same thing. human minds are software running in a classical computer. that's what you already are – a computer running software. the hardware details don't matter to the computations. no soul or organic molecules required. an intelligence software program has to do certain things. included on the list is create knowledge. the only known knowledge-creating process is evolution. knowledge can be created through replication with variation and selection. (in the case of ideas this would more normally be called brainstorming and critical thinking to eliminate errors). software that does this within various parameters, and does a few other things, would be a thinking person. that's all there is to it. stuff like emotions are emergent properties of software, they aren't tied to souls, hardware made of organic molecules instead of silicon, etc 

if you have no training, trying to rescue a drowning person with no equipment in deep water is actually dangerous. they aren't thinking straight and may drown you. but let's assume rescuing them is only a tiny risk. then go ahead. life is full of risks. if you ride in a car you could die in a car crash. trying to avoid all risk would be silly. you don't need a big benefit to accept a tiny risk. it's up to you if you want to rescue them. if you value human life, then that's a reason to do it since you want to see the guy healthy. if you like people in general, and you have a way to be a big help to someone at a low cost, then you can do it, go ahead. there's nothing in Objectivism to outlaw this (nor strictly mandate it. but Objectivists respect human life. so if it's a tiny cost, well, can't you afford it? Objectivists ought to be productive and be able to afford tiny costs to promote their values.). it's great to look for opportunities to trade mutual benefit in general. if you had more time maybe you'd ask him to pay you $10 to help. but you're in a hurry. you could ask him afterwards. i bet he'd give you $10 if you really care, or perhaps he'll volunteer some other reward for you. but $10 is so small compared to a life that it's not a big concern here, nor is the $10 of effort and risk this cost you. (it depends on the scenario parameters. if it costs you $5000 of effort and risk, then that could harm your own life, and he might not pay you back after you save him, so you have to consider what you want to do.) 

Wouldn't the simulation hypothesis erase the concept of guilt altogether? If none of us are real, including the people around one and including oneself, doesn't any kind of ethic based on the value of life just disintegrate? After all, the value of simulated life is just simulated too. Consider this for a moment. Two worlds. One changed. One is still the same. For which world do we redefine our morals? The one that changed. I think that the true question is not if we should apply our morals to video games, but why we should not apply the morals used in video games to a simulated reality. Well, basically it's the same question from a different perspective and will yield the same answers defining boundaries of conscience, but it highlights the conclusions that are more worrysome to me than an existence that at least technically ceases whenever I turn off the device. I say technically, because many of them, you couldn't kill without erasing my memory. They only ever truly existed in the perception of the player, or reader, not in the machine you turn off and on without consequence (if you saved, that is). They are basically immortal in my mind, as long as I remember their "lives". Many others, I never even recognized as more than a target in the first place. You wouldn't want to be one of them. They are not just dead, but erased from all forms of existence. We already developed a stance on morals in games that would then apply to reality: Morals count only if you immerse yourself to the point where you feel that they do. I've destroyed billions of enemies in Galaga-style space shooters and other simple games, but tore myself up over the decision to sacrifice Kaidan or Ashley in Mass Effect. And I didn't even like either of them much. These different styles of play do not interfere with each other, I apply one I deem fitting for the game. So what is to keep someone else, who decides to play the "game" differently, from playing it the way I'd play GTA2? 

you should survey some important philosophies and get involved with highly critical philosophy discussion. criticism is necessary to find errors. one of the main problems with philosophy is lots of people have a bunch of bullshit ideas and don't realize all the problems with their ideas. the list of philosophies you take a look at should include Objectivism (Ayn Rand) and Critical Rationalism (Karl Popper) in addition to stuff like artistotle and kant which everyone recommends (i think they're bad, but you decide). the only very good philosophy discussion forum i'm aware of is $URL$ (this is a Q&A site, which is a different structure with advantages and disadvantages. it's fine but it's different than open-ended discussion where people just chat and argue) 

the consequences of rejecting induction are being freed up to learn something better from Karl Popper. all your concerns come from basically taking a typical inductivist epistemology and then rejecting one central part (induction) and keeping the rest. what you need is a thoroughly non-inductivist epistemology which is built from the ground up to make sense without induction. that's what Popper offers. (so far there are no non-Popperians offering this). 

Socialism destroys wealth. That's bad for everyone. See $URL$ and $URL$ and $URL$ Objectivists want to produce wealth for themselves, not take it from richer people. Objectivism values productivity and opposes taking the unearned by force. Socialism is collectivist. Objectivist is individualist. 

check your premises about who is intelligent. anyway, the underlying issue is people disagree about stuff. there are lots of ideas out there. many of them conflict. sorting it out is hard. being intelligent and reasonable in no way prevents someone from making a mistake when judging some ideas that disagree. it's hard. a secondary issue is that people have bad methods of judging ideas. they're bad at discussing hard issues to conclusions. they don't really know how and they kinda wing it and mistakes are common. if anyone would like to improve at this, a good place to start is this book $URL$ or this discussion forum $URL$ 

"If a triangle has 2 sides, then it wouldn't be a triangle." I know there is something seriously wrong with this statement, but what exactly is it? Is the statement true? You cannot suppose that a triangle has 2 sides? I mean, it is supposed, it's not illegal to do so...any help would be appreciated, thanking you in advance. 

Yes, I think you've basically got it right. Honestly the best way to look at it is in the form of a reductio ad absurdum. Take the negative "God does not exist" and prove a contradiction from it, then the negative must be false and God must exist. So he starts with the proposition that God does not exist, then goes on to show that he can imagine a greater being, one that does exist, and that's a contradiction because the original God that didn't exist was supposed to be the greatest. 

I'm no expert but I think the way in which Kant's comments apply to Anselm's argument are to undermine the idea that the concept of something and the corresponding being are different. He says that nothing is added to the concept to get the real thing. Something like 'there is no more in a hundred conceptual dollars than there is in a hundred real dollars', for if there were, then the concept would not accurately represent the real thing....I personally see a problem with this, as I think concepts are worlds apart from real objects. 

This argument is quite a complex one, I'm not sure whereabouts you found a summary of it, but I think the best way to look at it is as a reductio ad absurdum. A reductio starts off with an assumption, and then goes on to prove a contradiction that follows from that assumption. Since a contradiction has been shown, the opposite of the assumption must be true. In this case, the assumption is that God does not exist, and the contradiction is that I can imagine a greater God, one that does exist. The conclusion is therefore stated as the opposite of the assumption, that God does exist. I found your question very helfpful, it is a seeming paradox that I could define something to exist and yet observe that it does not. However I honestly believe that, though it may not have been what Kant was getting at when he said "being is obviously not a real predicate", existence is a special kind of property, one that we cannot define something to have. Though I am starting to have doubts about what I just said, I know that God exists, and if he ceased to exist, then he would cease to be himself. This is the definition of an essential property....versus an accidental property, which, if a thing ceased to have, then it would not be itself anymore. So basically what I'm saying is that, things that do exist, DO have existence as part of their definition, and so it IS possible to define something to exist (as long as it actually does) and God does exist, I assure you. Existence is part of his definition. 

On the subject of the morality of lying and secrets, I really like the utilitarian approach, that one must search for the greatest happiness for the greatest amount of people. In your example, telling the husband about the affair could... nah. It most likely will go against that goal. At least on the short term. The wife has two choices: Keeping the secret and bearing the guilt, but keeping her husband happy and content, or telling him, which will diminish his happiness and might or might not ease her conscience. It might cause a breakup with everybody being miserable. That would suggest that keeping the secret is the moral choice. But... A relationship works best if both are happy in it. She isn't, so keeping the secret might just delay the inevitable. The husband might forgive her, and the relationship could end up stronger than before. Or the breakup, that at first made everyone miserable, allows both to find partners that are better suited, which ends up causing the greatest amount of happiness for not only two, but four people. The chances for that are marginal though. As you see, both lying and being truthful can lead to good or bad. I don't think it is immoral to keep secrets. I think it is not even immoral to lie, unless it is done with intent to harm. And, I don't think that telling the truth is by default morally right. But what do all the bad endings have in common? Weakness. The reason we lie is that we are weak. Either the liar or the belied is not able to handle the truth, or we just don't trust people to deal with the truth in a manner that aims for the greatest benefit of all involved. This weakness is the cause of lies, and the nature of the evil that we falsely deem to be within the act of lying itself. If the Bible speaks of the Father of Lies, that is how I as atheist would picture him: Our weakness, our distrust, and our lack of benevolence in the face of uncomfortable truths.
