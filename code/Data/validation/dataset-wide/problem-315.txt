Defensive Teleportation A bomb can easily be teleported onto a ship, but the defending ship can just as easily teleport it off again. Ship teleportation systems are programmed to identify high energy reactions and teleport them as far away as possible. Unfortunately, this autonomous system only works because explosions have a 'loud' energy signature that the teleportation can lock on to. Human boarders cannot be as easily identified, and therefore have a chance to gain control of the ship without being spaced. 

Tar pits Why invent a new trap when nature has one that it's been using for thousands of years? And they're self concealing! A few years of dust and no one will ever suspect that the bones of a few dozen explorers lie beneath their feet until it is too late. 

All that aside (as dot_Sp0T said in comments) with the level of sophistication your robots have it seems silly to assume they wouldn't be able to repair themselves or at least book themselves into the nearest local automated repair shop as needed. Oh! and go read Autofac by Philip K. Dick, he beat you to this story (pretty much) by decades. 

All the resources, all the materials, everything you need to build a space station in the first place are basically at the bottom of a gravity well (i.e. on planets). Was that "asteroid belt" I heard you say? it's a damn long way out from the sun to that, & energy to run your station out there is going to be thin on the ground as a result, travelling out & back with the ore will take a damn long time & likely even more energy than lifting the stuff off planet. So everything you need to build, extend & maintain it has to be hauled uphill (or a very long way). In the short term there may be advantages to a space station but ultimately in the long term the cost benefits of hauling all that stuff off world every-time you have enough population increase to need to expand (or build a new station) means that long term the planet route will win every time. Whatever advantage space stations do or don't have long term it's just cheaper & more economic to drop your population at the bottom of that hill where everything they need (for expansion) is anyway. Which doesn't mean we shouldn't have space stations, we should, there are a lot of things we can do with them we can't do (or can't do as easily, or as well) on a planet & they're going to be a useful part of our toolkit, but as a housing solution for the bulk of the human race they're a non-starter. All in all even an un-terraformed planet where you have to live in a contained environment is a better solution for a growing population than a space station, at least everything needed to build new living space is close at hand there. 

Alternatively, if you are interested in lighting the werewolf on fire you can always go for dioxygen difluoride. 

Even as the first layer gets perforated, the holes are small and don't significantly compromise the layer's structural integrity. The second layer isn't penetrated by the more diffuse impact, and maintains an airtight seal. There are, of course, many variations on the design that Fred Whipple proposed in 1946. You can use more than just two layers - that way if the energy is not sufficiently dispersed by the first impact, it can be dispersed several more times before risking your final layer. You can use flexible materials such as Kevlar instead of rigid aluminum. But the basic principles remain the same. By using multiple layers separated by gaps you disperse the impacting energy and make it possible to protect your ship with a great deal less shielding than you would need with a solid shield. 

How would technology be utilized to keep prisoners in check? How could war technology be applied to prisoners 

Now we set up multiple meetings with the generals of the army. To the best of our effort we secure the meeting rooms against espionage. At each meeting a small part of the code is given to all generals. After all meetings are done, all generals have the entire code and thus know the battleplan. Some meetings will have been compromised so parts of the code are known, but as long as the code is complicated enough this will still leave our opponent with many possible battle plans*. Unfortunately, any battle plan lasts until first blood. There are only two ways of changing a battleplan: redo the meetings (takes long) or send an uncoded message to your generals (immediately compromised). If this system works, then war would become a game of disrupting your opponents plan as often as possible. Either they will have to disclose their entire plan to respond quickly or spend a lot of effort and time on setting up a new plan. Now this leads to some interesting mindgames. If your opponent can guess what your plan is then they know how to disrupt it. Naturally you want to make your plan as unpredictable as possible so you would choose suboptimal plans, but then your opponent may guess that you are not following the optimal path and try to disrupt suboptimal plans. This mindgame can go around in circles forever. Great generals may be separated from the good ones simply because they know how to predict the thinking pattern of their opponent. In short: I hope you like mindgames. *I'm not a cryptologist, but it wouldn't surprise me that it's possible to set up codes in such a manner that small scraps of code hold little information. 

To add to the list of horribly dangerous chemicals... Hydrofluoric Acid There are plenty of acids that are more dangerous than HF, but it would probably be significantly harder for your heroes to get their hands on fluoroantimonic acid, triflic acid or the like. And HF is plenty dangerous on its own. From the Wikipedia article: 

Noninterference clause The gods are bound by a set of complex and mostly unknown god-rules. One of the primary rules is that a god cannot directly interfere with the chosen of other gods. The noble god interprets this rule much more strictly than the duplicitous god does. 

How about a custard filled ballistic vest? What you may be looking for is a non newtonian fluid, something that stiffens when sudden kinetic force is applied to it (like custard). So you might imagine a vest made of sealed sections (pockets or cells) & each of these sections filled with such a fluid. You couldn't shoot the wearer (through the vest) but you could stab him (through the vest), if you stab slowly enough (this is almost exactly the effect of the shields in Dune). For the actual material of the vest you probably can't beat Demigan's suggested spider silk, but I wouldn't know which of our currently available non newtonian fluids is best to fill it's pockets with. It probably won't stop the effect of a bullet completely but it will take some of the kinetic force out (redistribute it sideways) & the forward force that's left (probably most of it?) will be spread over a much larger area of the body so it'll be (a little bit) more like being hit by a flat plank of wood than shot with a bullet (so sort of a full body airbag for bullets), a lot less lethal. On the down side I'm not sure we have anything right now that would provide sufficient stopping power for what you want to it's own weight in ratios that would make such an armor even slightly reasonable for a person to wear & move in though. Edit: rereading your question, my answer will only fit the bullets in your question.. if you really mean to include tanks & gas & weren't just getting a little excited & giving way to a touch of hyperbole as you typed then there's nothing, you want magic. It seems this idea was already very much in the design stage if not in production as far back as 2006 (see Liquid Bullet-Proof Armour), and it seems much lighter & more flexible than I thought it could be with currently available materials (while still retaining adequate utility). 

Really, all these great answers and nobody's mentioned EULAs yet? The corporation isn't the Cult's end goal - the product is. Cthulhu Corporation produces a seemingly innocuous software product, with a clause in the EULA (End User License Agreement) that collects the soul of every user and uses them to fuel the summoning of Eldritch Horrors. 

It could go either way, but I'd lean towards cooperation. I saw a documentary a few years back (which I unfortunately can't find at the moment) about a group of Israeli and Palestinian kids who were brought together for a while. As best I remember it, the kids entered with the prejudices they inherited from their parents, but upon meeting each other they abandoned them pretty quickly and became friends. I don't remember if any of the kids had been directly impacted by the conflict. I also don't remember the ages of the kids. What I understood from that was that the hatred and prejudice that fuel the conflict are taught to the youth at a very young age. But at the same time they are more flexible and will more quickly forget their differences than adults would in the right circumstances. And external threats are excellent at uniting people. 

Information is key in any war. Spreading misinformation seems nigh impossible in this world, but one could use lack of information as a strategy. In the question it is stated that defence are possible but they do not work 100% of the time. I will make the assumption that militaries in this world know a more precise percentage. For example: one can keep a room safe for X minutes with a Y% success rate. The exact numbers don't really matter as long as they are known. The general of an army uses computer simulation to generate an extremely large number of battleplans. Here, the battle plans can be presented as decision trees. This decision tree will inevitably be compromised at some point. The trick is to pick one battle plan within this tree and keep secret which one is chosen. So how would on go about that? We can give each path within the decision tree a code. The codes are made as similar as possible whilst remaining unique. For example a small number of codes may look like this 

You all are picking boring animals. Let's go look at the extinct list! I'd start with a glyptodont. It's basically a giant armadillo. It's strong but slow, and a quick shaman with a knife should be able to get past its armor without trouble. Now that you are invulnerable from the neck down, it's time for some strength. Bears are the obvious choice, but I think that they are probably outmatched by the 1,000 kg giant ground sloth. Now it's time to get some speed and endurance. Here the pronghorn is probably your best bet, if you can catch one. Sneaking up on one in the open plains where they live might be difficult, though, so you might turn instead to the majestic moose, which can clock in at 35 mph for over 500 m are excellent swimmers and can kick in every direction. For stealth and a wicked pouncing leap it's time to go jaguar hunting. And now you're ready to face your mammoth!
