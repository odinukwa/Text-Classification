Go the Rick & Morty route, have an omnipotent force from outside the galaxy impose rules upon those within it, for their own entertainment. It's already a game, why not game-ify the world of those within? If you can't think of a valid justification for your game logic, invoke a higher power. 

1) Kidnap Tommy Wiseau 2) Bring him to the future 3) Clone him 4) Send Tommy Wiseau back in time, reverting his memories 5) Give the clone Tommy Wiseau's memories (must be possible, based on step 4) 6) Offer Tommy Wiseau's Clone whatever he desires, to complete The Room 2. 

It depends how many troops are fighting, what type they are, and what techniques they're using. If you work out the rough area your armies take up (give each person 1msq for simplicity) you can split that into appropriate battalions and work out the scale required. I'd recommend drawing it out on a grid based system, then massaging it into reality. In terms of formula, I think that's not necessary, if you draw out your armies you should be able to get a feel for how far apart they should be. Calculate - or decide - the range of any archers/magic, and have at least that gap between the sides before they commit to the battle, and work from there. 

Sit and do nothing, unless prompted by an Alien. You'll probably die anyway, but that's your best bet for showing that you're not harmful. 

Boredom. Technology takes away all meaning from some peoples lives, and they decide they want to experience something new, namely living as mer-people on an ocean world. 

I agree with whoever stated the question is too broad, but am compelled to answer regardless. When primitive Chaoman first adopted religion, it was to explain the seemingly randomness of events, by claiming they were controlled by a deity (the RNG in the sky). The hardcore conclusion of this logic was that they could only be sure they were doing the God's will if they relied entirely on chance, wherever possible. Any attempts to subvert this randomness were seen as blasphemy, and over time the populace adapted to embrace chance, not complaining when something goes wrong, but accepting that RNJesus disapproved of what they were attempting to do. Over the years, the embrace of randomness, as opposed to the minimizing of risk, inevitably resulted in massive failures and massive successes, and the Chaomen became adept at dealing with failure and exploiting success. To them, if something wasn't incredibly risky, it wasn't worth doing, and was disrespectful to that greater power looking over them all. It was thanks to this that their society evolved as quickly as it did, and despite many hurdles (such as when they blew up their moon), they would always find a solution to their problems. Everyone was always pushing some sort of boundary, and dealing with both success and failure, and so the world was at peace. The unfortunate downfall of the Chaomen occurred when one of their travellers returned from a journey through space, with tales of a society that actively worked against RNJesus, trying to ensure that everything was as risk free as possible. Having lived in their society for a few years, the traveller had embraced this new philosophy, and opened a new church on the homeworld, arguing that risk should be minimized, in favour of orderly progress. By using these new teachings, the new cult spread like wildfire - by managing its risks it was able to outperform the Chaomen in most day to day situations, and despite not making as many technological breakthroughs, it eventually spread to encompass the globe, as people were drawn in by the much greater lifespan of those within, as well as their seemingly content demeanour. With this, RNJesus was discredited, and the Chaomen began to live stable lives. Their new goal was to eliminate risk, and that meant eliminating anything dangerous to their new lifestyle (animals, professions, ideas, etc). Finally, they succeeded, and never accomplished anything of note ever again, until the species the traveller had met, many years before, showed up on their doorstep. They saw how orderly the Chaomen society had become, and were happy to offer improvements that could make their lives even more efficient and risk free. The Chaomen accepted this, acknowledging that this species had invented the orderly method of living, and that it was far less risky to take their advice than to ignore it, and so they allowed these newcomers to reform their society. Quickly they were no more than slaves, and this lasted for many centuries, as nobody was willing to take the risk of speaking out against their new masters. Finally, when all hope seemed lost, one of the workers found an ancient tablet, whilst deep down in the gold mines - it spoke of RNJesus, and the power that came from embracing his will. With this, the Chaomen slowly embraced their true nature, and completely devastated the new world order, reintroducing massive levels of chaos into their every action, and throwing off the shackles of risk management. For them, Order was nothing but a tool, used to manipulate them, and leaving them susceptible to the whims of others. Only by embracing their chaotic nature could they thrive, and thrive they did... until they deleted the entire universe, and nobody could really complain about that. 

Become a hermit. Personally I'd wish for a house on the moon, and if that was outside the scope of prayers I'd simplify by prayers, piece by piece, until I had everything required to get to the moon and build a house/infrastructure to survive. Then I'd wish for the ability to move the moon, and if that was too much I'd again simplify my prayers until they reached the point where they were accepted, and build some giant engines on the moon. Then I'd fly off on the moon, into the wilderness of space, and leave Earth behind, living off wishes. Sure it may be a lonely existence, but at least I won't be a slave to the whims of others prayers. Really I'd just need to make sure nobody knew it was me who stole the moon, as I suspect wishing for 'the moon to reappear' would be outside the scope of a prayer, so I'd be free! Once I'm exploring, I'd just mess about with wishes I guess, use them to stock up on food, make repairs, etc, maybe get the latest TV shows etc.
