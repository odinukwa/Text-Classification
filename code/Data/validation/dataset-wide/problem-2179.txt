First rule of negotiating It is not a negotiation if you cannot walk away... it is complaining Decide for yourself. Are you: 

Never wait for somebody to ask you. You'll always be waiting. Don't seek a position "just for the money" If you have a bona fide reason to ask if you'd be good at sales, why wouldn't you ask? 

Hoping for unsolicited job offers? Creating a post to direct potential people that want to hire you? 

What is a sales job like in this company? How do I develop the skills to be good at sales? Do you think I'd be good at sales? 

Recently a U.S. employer told us not to skate(board) between buildings because they were liable for us. Is this true? The buildings were leased by the employer from a single landlord. The space between the two buildings (e.g. parking lot, sidewalk, ...) is owned by the landlord. When you walk on the landlord's property between two workplaces is the employer really liable? I thought this kind of liability was all state-by-state and covered by Worker's Compensation, not the liability of the employer... 

What is it that the organization seeks in hiring you? How do you provide a specific (and brief) enough resume to communicate your value effectively 

Older people are not always better, but more experienced people can see patterns in development and business that transcend merely the newest techniques / programming language / algorithm / trends. Don't worry about your age. If you really have more value than your potential employer offers you, make your case. If they do believe you, you'd better live up to what you represented. If they don't believe you, go seek out another offer and work at a different place. If you can't find another job, maybe you're not worth what you thought you were worth. 

I took a management class from a man that ran the production of the U.S. F-16 airplanes. He had a very wise expression in his closing slide. If an employee is not doing their job (including being practical) then determine 

I am a highly skilled and experienced professional that is in high demand. Even then, I don't expect to get unsolicited job offers and certainly not because I developed a website or a LinkedIn site. Anybody that I want to hire me won't be searching for me randomly on the web. All the jobs I've gotten have been from personal referrals. As a 'grey beard', I find no value in knowing your personal details when looking to hire. I want to hear you talk to me personally about your strengths / weaknesses. I want to talk to people you know or have worked with you about the same. There is no room in that dialog for a posted resume with tidbits of personal information. I maintain a small footprint on LinkedIn; enough to satisfy the curiosity of a few people. Save the personal information for social media - that's what it is for, socializing. Focus on your economic value for job searching. Know what you are worth and why. Seek out opportunities proactively. Don't try to passively 'fish' for jobs by posting an attractive resume, that's sounds a little conceited. 

I'm not overly happy in my current work environment. The people are good, the hours are perfect, the amount of flexibility I have is nice, but the job itself is pretty terrible. Lack of work at times, not really growing my skills, and there is little to no advancement opportunity. So I have a degree in IT. I want to continue to work in the IT field, but currently there is nothing open in my area that fits my skillset. So I'm looking for a new job but I can't seem to find anything in IT. There are plenty of jobs outside of the IT field that I feel I would be qualified for. My question becomes, is it bad for me to work in a job that is not IT for a time until something in IT opens up? Will it look bad on my resume? Will potential future employers think, because I quit an IT job to work in, let's say Sales or something not IT, that maybe I couldn't handle my previous IT job? 

First of all, I wouldn't threaten to leave the company. Let me explain. During a performance review, you are (probably) going to be asked what you like and dislike about your year so far. They usually ask you if you'd like to work on anything specific or just keep doing what you're doing. Granted they might not ask those questions, but it would definitely be a place where you could talk to your manager and ask about what you can do, if you can get different projects this year, etc. Just say you're wondering what projects they have in mind, and see if maybe you can suggest and/or push your manager a certain direction. Telling him "if things don't change, I quit", will probably not put you in a great light, and might even jeopardize your job. What I would do is make a list of the things you want to work on, ask your manager if any of the things you want to work on are feasible for the company and gauge his/her reaction. If they don't or can't give you the projects you are looking for, then it's probably best to look for another job. Obviously it'd be nice to give them a heads up, but it's not up to you to make sure their feelings aren't hurt, it's up to you to watch out for yourself. The best you can do is make sure you give proper notice if you do find another job, and do everything you can to finish out the work you're on before leaving. Leaving on good terms is nice, but it's not always up to you. 

There is no reason for a Sales Manager to lie about these things. If it wasn't in your plan, I'm assuming you don't have much experience in sales. Find out if this is a commissioned position, a salaried position, whether you have quotas to meet, how you close a deal, how you get paid or get credit for a sale, ... Disregard the rumor Consider the rumor as flattery and nothing else. Play it straight. Be sincere. Ignore the politics. If you're working for a profitable, reputable, commercial entity then they will reward success. Focus on whether or not you'd be successful and happy at sales, regardless of the rumor. Once you've re-oriented yourself to the right path without the rumor, you'll find your proper direction and know what to do. 

I've been consulting for +15 years. I'd never ask for fewer hours on a critical project. That sounds like you don't really care if the project is successful. In addition, asking for more money would just pour salt on the open wound. Put yourself in their position. Under what circumstances would you keep somebody that asked for more money to do less work? Likely only if you were forced to do so. How would you respond? I would look for other resources to complete the work. I would look to replace the person that was part-time unless I didn't need full-time help. I ask for more money when I know I am undervalued or when costs have increased significantly. I time when I ask for more money when I know that they can afford to pay more. I give my clients three to six months notice that I'm raising my rates. I also let them know that I charge everyone the same, so they don't feel like they are being taken advantage of. 

Don't take a shortcut across the lawn. That is selfish (in the most objective definition of the word). People / companies spent time and money making the surrounding area beautiful. It is hard enough to preserve our environment without people going "off trail" and destroying what was created. There are a series of principles known as Leave No Trace. The concept is that we should attempt to leave as little trace of our existence on Earth as possible in order to preserve the greater environment for both the natural (non-human) world and future humans. This method of conservation involves a seven point program of principles to follow. Although Leave No Trace is often applied in the Back Country (i.e. backpacking) there is no reason why it cannot be followed in the Front Country (i.e. likely where you are reading this!). The concept of conservation does not have to be put into "liberal" or "conservative". It can be thought of merely as are you consuming something that other people / animals / plants could or should use. Conservation can be a simple as "are you being selfish and consuming the grass by walking on it". If you are having no impact, then why not use the grass. However, if your impact is the destruction of the grass and encouraging other people to destroy the grass, then don't do it. Study the 

Not a direct answer, just a suggestion that the "unbreakable" 2-page rule might not be. With *cough* decades of experience, I have managed to keep my CV down to 6 or 7 pages (12 point font). I have never had anyone complain of the length, and have no trouble landing contracts. I got it down to 6 or 7 pages by leading with a summary, so that I don't need to repeat it on every job, and a cut-off about 10 years back, with "further details available on request". It's tricky to judge. Some might say that experience 10 years ago is stale, but if it reinforces more recent experience and underlines my subject matter knowledge, then I think it germane. One thing that I have never heard anyone discuss is how prospective readers will know that it is longer than 2 pages. I can't remember the last time that I got a CV from a prospective candidate which was not in electronic form. That means that someone reading my CV reads the summary, and is either hooked, or moves on to the next guy. If hooked, he can read further and stop whenever he has read enough to convince him. If we wants to know lots, he can read to page 6 or 7; or he might just read the summary and the two recent jobs. But he's not going to know that my CV is is 6 or 7 pages long unless he reads that far, and by that time it's too late to reject it for being too long. Just stating what works for me. YMMV 

I am with the most stupid person on this one, but for a different reason. Don't include two weeks on your CV/resume because ... what is the purpose of a cv/resume? I would say that it is too tell a prospective employer what you can bring to them. I would further say that you are highly unlikely to learn enough new stuff in two weeks, that you don't have from other positions, to be helpful to a future employer. If asked about it later, explain just that. Background: I had one perm position a few decades ago, so may not be up on the nuances. As a developer of embedded systems, I am generally handed a bunch of "stuff to read" at the start of each new contract and expected to slowly start becoming productive after 3 to 4 weeks (longer for perms, imo). That's on projects with 8 to 15 developers. My current project is developing s/w for a military satellite and we were told that we are not expected to be productive for 3 months (!). Tl;dr did you really do or learn anything new in those two whole weeks that could be of benefit to a future employer? 

Short answer: No, don't put this on your resume. Long answer: Just because you were let go during the trial period, due to slower than normal adaptation to the job, doesn't necessarily mean you're bad at what you do. Maybe you just take longer to grasp all the ideals that the company has for their employees. This can lead to you being let go, as you are not "perfect" in their eyes. Now, knowing that yourself, doesn't mean everyone will see it that way when you walk into an interview. Even if you explain what happened, they might just assume you're putting yourself in a positive light instead of telling them what really happened. I would say leave the job off your resume and just go from there. Build your resume up on your strengths and past employment that you performed well in. The people who read your resume will only see that you lasted in your previous job for a month, and they'll wonder why, possibly might kill your chances of getting an interview. Again, don't get down on yourself. Each company has different expectations of their employees, some expect you to be a pro within a week, some expect it's going to take longer to get settled in and they understand things can take time, especially for a new employee. Just keep working hard and keep your resume focused on the good. 

If you've already explained your situation to them, and they still can't or won't be flexible, then you're out of luck. You don't really have any "rights" when it comes to interviewing, they can choose whether or not they want to be flexible, they don't "owe" you anything as you're not employed. So no, you don't have any rights, and it's probably best to just forget this job, or find a way to have someone watch over your Aunt while you interview. 

The fact that there were no technical questions asked, that would pertain to how you would do this job, were you to be given it, means this was most likely just an introductory interview. An interview to ask those generalized questions like "where do you see yourself in 5 years", or "name a time where you were in charge and had to make a difficult decision". In this instance, the position of the interviewer is irrelevant. Since she was just conducting the introductory interview, there was simply no reason to question her position with the company. It may not have been meant as an insult or meant to offend, but that's probably how it came off, especially after she said "I will send your application to the hiring manager", it's clear she wasn't the one making the hiring decision, she was just getting those common questions out of the way. In my experience, the phone interview is generally just an "introductory" interview, kind of see how you may fit into the workplace, a few generalized questions that they ask to get them out of the way so the next interview can focus solely on the technical side. Next time, just worry about answering the questions(and no it doesn't mean you can't ASK questions), and let them decide who is going to interview you. If they're interviewing you with unqualified people, maybe that's not a company you want to work for anyway.
