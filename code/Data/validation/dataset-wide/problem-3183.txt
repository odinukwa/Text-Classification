According to Wikipedia, what was the Cobo Arena is now the Grand Riverview Ballroom which is the round building on the right of the google maps image. It's a separate building from the Joe Louis Arena (which is on the left, as marked). 

In the case of variable one, the distance determines the number of beacons that have to be relayed through. The more beacons between the source and destination the longer the process takes. For variable two, once a watcher (i.e. the person watching for the previous beacon in the chain) has seen a signal, they need to light their own beacon. If there is a pilot fire going then this should take a few moments. If they have to use another method (such as flint and steel) to start the fire, it could take a few minutes depending on the conditions and the competence of the person. [An article notes that the beacon fires used pitch-soaked rope instead of wood as these were easier to light in all conditions and produced more smoke]. Variable three will be dependent on a few factors. The time of day will play a big part. At night it's the fire itself that would be visible. In the middle of the day, the beacon's fire will not stand out so much so it's more likely to be any smoke that's spotted. The beacon needs to burn large and bright enough to be visible over a distance of several miles, and during the day establish a solid trail of smoke to do likewise. Weather is also a factor. Rain or fog will make the fire harder to establish and reduces contrast & visibility making the beacon harder to spot. It's the fourth variable that introduces the biggest variation in timing. An attentive watcher, in good weather at night might notice the beacon within moments of it becoming sufficiently established. However, if people manning the beacon are at the end of a long shift on watch and have got sleepy or distracted and the weather is raining or foggy, then it might take minutes (or longer) for the lit beacon to be noticed. So in ideal circumstances, it could take less than a minute per beacon for the message to travel along the chain. In the worst case, it might never arrive at all. The distance from Land's End in Cornwall to London is 263 miles (in a straight line). Assuming that the path of the beacons is unlikely to be an exact straight line, let's take an estimate of 300 miles for the "journey". With beacons on hills 5 miles apart, since Southern England isn't blessed with mountain peaks that are visible over tens of miles. Also the information is also going to be passed along the coast to inform the waiting English ships in their ports. This gives around 60 beacon stations for the message to pass through from Cornwall to London. If we assume the best case, where a message might take a minute per beacon, that would give a transmission time of about an hour. Alternatively, if you allow for a few sleepy fellows along the way and settle on an average of 5 minutes per beacon, then you have a transmission time of around 5 hours. 

By the time that Mapungubwe was a trading centre, the silk routes between Europe, Arabia, India and China were long established. As the linked article notes, trade would have travelled by sea up the East African coast and would have then travelled by sea or overland into Arabia, India and beyond. 

According to the wikipedia page for the Transport Act 1947, nationalization was effectively a rescue act because the "big four" were bankrupt. In terms of compensation for their owners, it says: 

From the context of the quote, it would seem that the "dilemma" refered to relates to Spain's loss of empire. Spain became heavily dependent on trade (especially gold) from their colonies in the Americas. As Great Britain became a greater naval power, the links to Spain's possessions came under threat. I'd guess that the dilemma they faced was about investment in their navy. Keeping a large navy up-to-date and ready for sea was (and still is) expensive, both in terms of money and manpower. So expanding their navy to protect their trade would eat into the profits from the American trade and so reduce its value to the economy. The alternative was to keep the navy small and cheap but risk the trade and communications (and, therefore, control of the colonies) in times of war. 

This does depend a lot on what you consider to be accurate given the times and the circumstances. For example, the smoothbore artillery of the period were not particularly accurate themselves when compared to the modern rifled artillery we now have. In European service (and that means, essentially, British service) rockets were intended for area saturation. That is, no single rocket was aimed to hit a specified target but a volley was intended to hit a given area. Their advantages over field and siege guns of the time, were range, weight of shell and rate of fire. 

According to the Brief Outline of the History of Stage Lighting, the electric spotlight wasn't invented until 1904. However, during the 1890's they did have carbon arc spotlights, so you track down one of those or use an electric one and hope that no one in the audience is too hot on the exact history of the lamps. 

Whereas, for comparison, the same 30 yards might only accomodate a 6 gun battery (and, on the battlefield, probably fewer than that). Congreve goes on to explain how the rockets can be used in the field. 

I'd guess that Bx Sv Star "Central Europe" was just shorthand for Bronze Service Star "Central Europe", where the last part was the campaign for which the Bronze Service Star was awarded. As you're probably aware, "EAMET" was an abbreviation for "European African Middle Eastern Theater". See here 

If gardens were common on ships of the age of sail, then we would expect them to appear on ship's plans and on ship's models (which were manufactured as a type of blueprint prior to the ship's construction). I've never seen a ship's plan or model that featured one, which either suggests that they weren't common or that only atypical ships' plans and models survived to the modern age. The former seems more likely than the latter. You would also expect gardens to rate a mention in books and articles of the time. The famous Faulkner's Universal Dictionary of the Marine which covers naval terminology for almost anything carried on a ship makes no mention of them. 

Distance for the message to travel. Time from receiving the message to lighting one's own beacon. Time from lighting the beacon for it to become established enough to be visible at the next beacon. Time for the people at the next beacon to notice your beacon is lit. 

The first field radios evolved from the field telephones. In fact, the first field radios (such as the German Torn.Fu Series) could work in both modes as a radio and as a field telephone. However, while these units were portable, they required some additional set-up before use. That is, they couldn't instantly be used for communications. The first "Walkie-Talkie" style radios were developed for, and employed, by the US Army in 1940, although similar units quickly followed in the other armies. These were self-contained radios with battery power, that didn't require additional set up. While they couldn't realistically be operated on the move by infantry, they did allow communication to be established very quickly when the operator stopped.
