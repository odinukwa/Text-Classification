Yes. We know about hundreds of planets around other stars here in our galaxy; and we do not have the technology to capture an image of even one of them. Not even around our nearest star. If we can't capture an image of a planet a few light years away, we certainly could not see any structures on it. The Milky was is about 100,000 light years across; a civilization on the other side could have individual structures as big as our entire planet and we would not know it. 

If you want a "realistic" time travel "anyone" could plausibly do, you will have to look at the gaps in modern physics. New Scientist magazine (out of the UK) recently listed 11 things modern physics cannot explain; including the inflation necessary for a Big Bang, particle entanglement, how the force of gravity is conveyed, whether black holes exist (as a point-like gravitational source), dark matter, dark energy, zero-point energy (or alternatively why it is a hundred orders of magnitude smaller than theory demands), etc. Perhaps most importantly, Einsteinian General Relativity and Quantum Theory are irrevocably irreconcilable; they cannot both be correct. the super-majority of physicists have their money on Quantum theory, and assume Einstein's use of infinities is a fudge. We definitely know from quantum dynamics and experiments within that position is uncertain; in fact tunnelling transistors are tech based on that very phenomenon. There really is a quantum foam, etc. GR does not reflect reality at any extreme: There are black holes, but they do not collapse to an infinitely small point, because those do not really exist! Physics as it stands is plagued by infinities (even for quantum problems), which (the infinities) probably are not "real". The point of the Loop Quantum Gravity formulation, which is far along but still incomplete, is to forgo infinities: Meaning space is not infinitely divisible, it too comes in smallest-possible quantums like energy. (When one works out the maths starting with this assumption; the results force these smallest units of space to be like a chain-mail mesh of linked loops; hence the name.) Remember science fiction is fiction so you need somebody investigating one of these unknowns to find a property of it (something you invent) they can manipulate to send something back in time, either information or something physical like a person. Note that if time travel is possible; it means that all times exist simultaneously throughout the universe. If Loop theory is correct and there is no infinitely small sub-division of space or time, then there is a quantum of time, too; a smallest possible 'duration'. So the answer is, for realism, pick something current science does not explain, invent a solution to that problem that demands time travel, and then discover a way to exploit that to allow your scientist to time travel. 

I haven’t done the math on this (but (a) you specified science-based and not hard-science, and (b) you’re allowing magic):  The chasm lies under a deposit of some substance that’s many times denser than rock (neutonium?).  It exerts an upwards gravitational pull on the space immediately below it; with enough mass, it should be able to create a region where the gravitational field is zero (or infinitesimal).  Unfortunately(?), that also produces a higher than normal gravitational field on the surface above the deposit (i.e., above the abyss), but (handwave handwave …).          It’s hard to image such a structure occurring naturally, or being stable if it does exist.  It would probably collapse under its own weight.  So enter deus ex machina… it’s a constructed artefact (perhaps by a lost civilization, or by aliens).  (The builders might still live a mile lower.)  To support this notion (pun intended), I’ve added a second layer of the substance below the chasm, with pillars holding up the upper layer. This doesn’t address the viscosity of the air.  But, if you stipulate that the chasm is accessed by tunnels from the ocean floor, you can argue that the atmospheric pressure is much higher than that at the surface, and that’s a start. 

It would be difficult to devise this political scenario. You can't make "contracts" work without some sort of collective, one that is more powerful than either Party in the contract, to enforce the terms of the contract, and typically to restrict the terms allowed in contracts. Without such an entity, the more powerful Party in the contract can violate it at will; without punishment. For a contract to be any more than an empty promise, the weakest Party in a society must have some Court system they can use to force any other Party in a contract, even the most rich and powerful, to comply with the terms of the Contract. At least a credible threat to do that. You also have the problem that Rights are enforced by the State, and these indirectly (by various court decisions) restrict what we can even make Contracts to do: In the USA, you cannot have a contract that requires somebody to break a law, or allows an employer to break a law. For an example of the latter, a USA employer cannot have their employment contract say the employee waives their right to sue for sexual harassment (Heck, if we allowed that, I'd bet money some employment contracts would require sexual favors as part of the job.) A private (meaning non-governmental) employment contract cannot force employees to accept violations of workplace safety, they cannot require employees to risk their lives (or sacrifice them). (Such requirements can be part of military service, but are treated differently, and other restrictions still apply: On the front lines a commander can order a female soldier into lethal combat, but cannot order her to have sex with him.) Contracts are useless and meaningless to people that have zero chance to appeal to power to get them enforced. They are empty promises to the 99% if the only people that can enforce them are the rich and already powerful. Without enforceable restrictions on what terms are allowed in the contract, the rich and powerful have you trapped and can collude so there IS no alternative: For example, every State contract (by agreement of the Rulers of States) demands 90% of your income. None of the States dare allow anything else even if they wanted to: The rest of the States have agreed to shut down all Trade with any member that does that. By collusion among States with greedy and power hungry leaders, I think your system will quickly develop into a lot of oppression and slavery with no escape for the citizens. Sure, they're free to switch from one slave owner to another: But their contract says to do so, they must pay a fee equivalent to five years of their salary; and every State's contract says the same thing. 

Building on one aspect of AndreiROM’s comprehensive answer, I am reminded of The Space Eater by David Langford, in which 

The great Isaac Asimov seemed to think it was possible.  He wrote many short stories featuring Multivac, the ultimate supercomputer that spans the globe — and more — and slowly acquires control over everything, encroaching on personal privacy and freedom.  In his story “The Life and Times of Multivac”, one man analyzes Multivac’s structure and finds a weak point.  Then he physically attacks that point, triggering the downfall of the machine.

Polymorphs are similar to allotropes, but the term allotrope applies only to elements, while polymorph applies only to compounds.  Polymorphs are most often found in minerals and organic compounds (e.g., pharmaceuticals).  There are polymorphs of ice (solid $\mathrm{H_2O}$), but the ordinary ice that forms on puddles in winter (and that we make in our freezers and put into our drinks) is the only one that can exist at standard pressure.  However, Kurt Vonnegut’s novel Cat’s Cradle stipulates that there are others that can exist at standard pressure.  In particular, one called “ice-nine” has a melting point of $\mathrm{45.8\:°C}$ $(\mathrm{114.4\:°F})$, so it is stable at room temperature — and, indeed, on most of the Earth.  It has the additional property that if any liquid (or gaseous) $\mathrm{H_2O}$ comes into contact with ice-nine, it immediately freezes and also becomes ice-nine.  For most of the book, the ice-nine is kept carefully controlled and locked away.  But eventually it escapes into the environment and causes all the oceans to freeze, and it’s pretty much curtains for mankind. Oxygen has allotropes, too.  The best known ones are ordinary, atmospheric oxygen $(\mathrm{O_2})$ and ozone $(\mathrm{O_3})$, but there are others, including tetraoxygen $(\mathrm{O_4})$, which is unstable (or metastable).  Wikipedia notes: 

Further, a labyrinth is not an obstacle to a teleporter! He can pass through the walls and search it just as fast as if there were doors in every wall. I would suggest you make your spherical force fields so they are domes, half underground: Deep underground is where generators are buried. Make the first field about five miles across, thus 2.5 miles deep; giving Mike 32.7 cubic miles of dirt to search. Even if he can teleport to every location underground, he cannot see anything, so he has to find the generator by literally bumping into it and recognizing that he did so. The size of a truck (an 18 wheeler) is about 9000 cubic feet, giving Mike 16.3 million distinct locations per cubic mile of dirt, or 533 million opaque distinct locations to teleport into, in order to check each one, by virtue of intersecting it. The smallest stars, red dwarfs, can have a 50,000 mile radius. For each subsequent shell, add 5 miles to the radius. Mike must find the first generator before seeking the next one (outside the first field), and find the second before seeking the third, etc. You have the room to build 10,000 shells. 

It’s not important that any of these actually be appropriate for or commensurate to the danger that’s within; it’s only important to convey the message that the builders of the prison thought that the demon was dangerous. There’s a concept in physical security of “security in depth”: protecting physical assets with locked doors, fences, human guards, dogs, motion detectors, etc.  Computers have similar layers of defense, such as firewalls, compartments, containers and domains.  This answer represents an “in depth” approach to the psychological aspect of this problem.  After 99+ millennia, the best schemes for documenting the evil may break down.  Even if the warnings are understood, some people will defy them, perhaps believing them to be a deception, intended to keep people away from something valuable (like the warning signs that muggles see when they approach Hogwarts).  The techniques described in this answer should be easily understood 100K years from now, and might convince people who (willfully or otherwise) are not deterred by the other warnings. 

This is a little crude, in more ways than one.  Perhaps somebody can suggest improvements to (cough cough) clean it up. First of all, they’ll want to have a reservoir (or cistern) at (or, more likely, below) ground level.  This would allow them to capture and hold spring water temporarily, in case the spring and/or the pumping mechanism have varying flow rates.  (I’ll get back to that.)  If they’re collecting rainwater at ground level, they’re probably already doing this. As in initial capability, immediately after the apocalypse (or maybe even before), this could be as simple as a pond around the spring.  Given time to establish some infrastructure, there should probably be such a cistern in each building; this provides some security against bandits/raiders.  Rig something so that the water from the spring runs through pipes or other channels into the holding tanks in the basements of the buildings.  (Try to make it hard for attackers to slip poison into the reservoirs.) One added security measure is “security through obscurity” — after you have built a plumbing system that pipes the spring water into the buildings, bury it.  This may make it somewhat harder for adversaries to steal your water or tamper with the system.  Ideally, it will make the spring invisible. The question of getting the water to the upper floors remains.  Renan suggested a “bucketwheel”: 

I agree with two earlier answers (bait ball, attack large animals), in attacking larger animals you can employ the model of both wolves and lionesses: About half the predators lie in wait; the other half chase prey: The chasers have little to no chance of catching the prey on their own; but they are spread out and guide the prey, by fear, directly into the path of the ambush: The other half of their pack; which is fresh and collectively bring down the prey animal, with enough for all to eat their fill. Who chases and who waits can be a matter of age and experience; the young adults can make the attack; they are strong and fast reacting. Eventually they join the ranks of the chasers as those die or are lost to disease or injury. Chasing is less demanding than making the kill; the point isn't to actually catch or kill the prey. Chasers need to keep up, but mostly provide a reason for the prey to run away from them and toward the ambush. Although the idea of land animals is an obvious form of prey, I'd also think about them taking on an even bigger bird several times their own size; say one that feeds on fish, or is specially equipped to eat dangerous land animals that are too dangerous for your heroes to attack, but your heroes in a pack can take down the specialist and eat it, instead. 

Do this in a handwavium mine, and you’ve got parallel universes. You should look at the “Apprentice Adept” series by Piers Anthony.  It takes place in two parallel universes that have limited points of contact / overlap.  He doesn’t explain how this came to be; 

but handwaved the power source.  (For the record, I thought of this before I read the answers.)  If there’s power to spare, there are many options.  But the question said that all the solar power is accounted for, and that fuel (for the generators) is scarce, and I assume that the building complex isn’t within walking distance of a forest, a coal mine, or an oil well.  If the spring provides enough power to drive the bucketwheel (or bucket conveyor belt) and lift water 18 stories, that’s great, but that strikes me as unlikely. One idea that hasn’t been mentioned is to have a dual-track bucket conveyor belt.  One track would bring water up; the other would take waste material down, and thus provide the power to drive the belt and lift the water.  I am thinking specifically of toilet-type waste.  There might be others, but I imagine that these survivors would recycle as much as possible. The rate of disposal of waste varies with the time of day.  This is why it’s important to collect the spring water all the time, so the water that emerges from the spring overnight, and at other periods of low waste-disposal activity, doesn’t just go into the ground. Of course, if they’re using washing water, urine and feces in their gardens, this won’t work. 

I don't think it will, the brain maturation you are talking about is a biological phenomenon, not a training or learning phenomenon. Specifically, it is (at least one component of it is) coating the nerves in the brain with myelin, a physical process that improves accuracy of transmission and doubles the speed. This begins in puberty but does not proceed "brain wide" all at once; instead it seems to proceed in the order of evolutionary development. Since our large (comparatively to other animals) frontal cortex, responsible for planning and judgment and foresight, appeared late in human evolution, it is the last to be "optimized" in this way; and other structures related to emotion and sexual urges are the first. This is likely to be responsible for some of our teenage rebellious phase, driven by emotion and the desire to mate, taking lethal risks to do so (because earlier parts of the brain are working faster than our frontal cortex by a factor of two). It isn't "hormones", as popularly described, it is just a competition within the brain in which rationality, caution, and foresight are at a severe disadvantage and losing out to physical attraction, impulsiveness, and other strengthened emotions (love, hate, jealousy, greed). The brain just is not returned to balance until all parts are returned to equal footing, in the mid-20's, with some other physical developments as well. This is not a muscle; training will not hurry the growth of myelin, although severe punishments for "bad behavior" can still reduce the incidence of it; given enough fear of consequences, even adolescents will fall into line. But that is not "maturity", it is a simulation of it. The emotional life is still raging and keenly felt, even if the actions are not taken. 

They learned it by listening to our radio and television broadcasts.  They could have learned other languages that way, but America’s Got Talent and Britain’s Got Talent were the only shows they liked.

Now suppose that $\mathrm{O_5}$ is stable at standard atmospheric pressure and temperature.  And suppose that, like ice-nine, it acts as a catalyst, converting $\mathrm{O_2}$ (and maybe also $\mathrm{O_3}$) into $\mathrm{O_5}$, and that this conversion is very hard to undo (think particle accelerator).  It would be quite reasonable to expect $\mathrm{O_5}$ not to react chemically the way $\mathrm{O_2}$ does (remember the differences between the characteristics of diamonds and graphite).  Once this stuff got into the lungs of an oxygen breather, it would convert all the ordinary oxygen (including, eventually, the stuff in hemoglobin) into $\mathrm{O_5}$, which would not give the cells what they need.  You’d suffocate. Or maybe it’s just very, very bad for you — like ozone. I don’t know how $\mathrm{O_5}$ would be created with pre-WWI technology, but the existence of tetraoxygen $(\mathrm{O_4})$ was first predicted in 1924 as a result of experiments with liquid oxygen — so that technology existed then.  You would need very little handwavium to explain how somebody cooled oxygen, past the point where it condenses into a liquid, near to its freezing temperature, and this caused $\mathrm{O_5}$ crystals to form.  When allowed to thaw, they did not decompose, but rather started a Cat’s Cradle-like chain reaction that converted all the oxygen on the planet into toxic $\mathrm{O_5}$.
