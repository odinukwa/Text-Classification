Assuming the intensity of the sunlight is proportional to the area of the Sun which is showing, we can roughly calculate the intensity of sunlight, $I(d)$ as: $$I(d) = 1 - \frac{\mathrm{Area}_{\mathrm{overlap}}}{\mathrm{Area}_{\mathrm{Sun}}}$$ Where $\mathrm{Area}_{\mathrm{overlap}}$ is the overlap between the Moon and the Sun (the green area). $URL$ Some calculation finds the overlap to be: $$\mathrm{Area}_{\mathrm{overlap}} = 2r^2\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{d}{2r}\right) - \frac{d}{2}\sqrt{4r^2 - d^2}$$ Where $d$ is the distance between the centres of the Moon and the Sun. Similarly, the area of the Sun is: $$\mathrm{Area}_{\mathrm{Sun}} = \pi r^2$$ Putting this together, you get the graph: 

My telescope's sidereal tracking is lousy: it just doesn't work. To overcome this, when taking long-exposure photographs through it, what's the best way to reduce star trailing? 

As the comments have said, this is simply a camera effect known as a lens flare If you look around at the various bright stars, you can see this in multiple places, e.g.: 

Where the Y axis is brightness (ranging from 100% to 0%) and the X axis is $d$ (ranging from $2r$ to $0$). I hope this answers your question: the brightness does not change proportionally to coverage/time. Note: This assumes that $d$ increases linearly with time (the moon doesn't speed up or slow down as it moves across the Sun). 

I want to write a program which, when given a date, a time, latitude and longitude, returns a list of the planets, Messier objects and NCC catalogue objects what are visible in the sky at that time and place? Are there any APIs which can do this or would I have to calculate the positions? Preferably, this should be accessible using JavaScript 

Is there a way to take the red shift of an object and, from that, calculate a rough estimate of its distance from us (in parsecs, preferably)? 

However, this article sources its information from the website Physics Astronomy, a blog-type website which posts various articles on astronomical topics. Since Physics Astronomy doesn't seem to be a particularly reputable source, I will take this information with a pinch of salt. So, is this article true? Will you be able to see the Perseids in the daytime with the naked eye this year? 

I am wanting to plot a velocity profile (a plot of velocity against the star's distance from the galactic core) from the Gaia DR2, but so far my efforts have been disappointing. The information I have for each star are the declination ($\delta$), right ascension ($\alpha$), radial velocity ($v_r$), parallax ($\theta_\text{parallax}$) and proper motion ($\mu$) (ra and dec). I tried to calculate the star's distance from the galactic core using the cosine rule: $$ d = \frac{1000}{\theta_{\text{parallax}}}$$ $$\theta = \arccos{[\sin{\delta_\text{star}}\sin{\delta_\text{core}} + \cos{\delta_\text{star}}\cos{\delta_\text{core}}\cos{(\alpha_\text{star}-\alpha_\text{core})}]}$$ $$ r = \sqrt{d_\text{core}^2+ d^2 - 2d \times d_\text{core} \times \cos{\theta}} $$ Where $d$ is the distance from the Sun to the star. $d_\text{core}$ is the distance from the Sun to the galactic core. $\theta$ is the angular separation of the star and the galactic core. $r$ is the distance from the star to the core. And the star's speed using the equations: $$\mu = \sqrt{\mu_\text{dec}^2 + \mu_\text{ra}^2}$$ $$ v_t = 4.7 \mu d $$ $$ v = \sqrt{v_r^2 + v_t^2} $$ But the plot doesn't show any kind of trend (just a kind of blob). Have I calculated correctly and, if not, how could I calculate the tangential velocities and radius from the galactic core? Basically, I want to make the kind of plot that helps us identify dark matter in galaxies. 

The word we use to refer to what's inside the cosmic horizon is the 'universe', so what would you call the empty space outside of the horizon? 

I've recently become interested in the idea of building my own small-scale radio telescope. A quick online search finds a few instructions on how to build this using a satellite dish. These suggest a dish of radius of around 1 metre, but the only objects that you seem to be able to detect are the Sun, the Earth, the Moon (possibly) and communications satellites. This sounds like it would be become boring fairly quickly, and I would like to observe some deep-sky objects. Some example objects that I fancy observing (depending on how strong their signals are) are Betelgeuse/Sirius, the Crab Nebula and the Andromeda Galaxy. N.B. I am quite satisfied with pointing the dish at an object and the signal strength increasing. I don't expect to get any kind of image. Evidently, you cannot pick these up using a metre-wide dish, so what is the minimum size required to pick up these objects (noting that I can't exactly build Arecibo in my back garden)? In case it matters, I live in a rural area, ~5 miles from the nearest town. I originally emailed Jodrell Bank this question but they ignored me :P 

The beads of bright light can be seen thanks to the Moons rugged topography. They're called Baily's beads in honor of an English astronomer who explained the phenomenon, Francis Baily. In the photograph you posted, you can also see Solar prominences. It's plasma ejected into the corona. Its temperature is lower than that of the coronal plasma and it emits more visible light. 

IAU's official website mentions that the names of the 88 current constellations (Scutum included) were standardised during the organizations inaugural meeting in 1922 and apparrently haven't been changed ever since. 

They don't have a fixed-size exit pupil and you can gain about 1.8 mag above what you can see with a naked eye (based on a review from a Polish astronomy forum). With the field of view of about 25 degrees, this is an experience somewhat (to put it mildly) different from what you describe. However, it's enough to see quite a large piece of the sky at the same time and is probably the closest you can get to star-gazing goggles. To make it easier to picture, 25 degrees is approximately the angular size of the Big Dipper, from one end of the bowl to the tip of the handle. Due to their size and wide FOV, these binos are also known to be used in the same manner as goggles. Pictured below is a pair of Kasai WideBino 28 in a wearable, rubber casing. 

I know the name of the constellation has been changed but I can't find any information on who did it and when. I suppose it must have been the IAU (International Astronomical Union) but I have no idea regarding the time of the change. When was the English name of the constellation officially changed and who did it? 

While cleaning my desk, I found an out of date star map (puts the cleaning into perspective, huh?) where the Scutum constellation is still referred to as Scutum Sobiescianum). This is the original name Johannes Hevelius gave it in 1684 My map is (unfortunately) modern and comes from the 2nd half of the 20th century. It's a Polish one so it's not odd for it to still use the traditional name. The main illustration of the Scutum article in Polish Wikipedia happens to do so as well. 

Regarding the original picture from the question No, it is not feasible to get a picture like this. According to this webpage the photograph you posted was taken with the Hubble Space Telescope's Wide-Field Planetary Camera 2. The telescope itself has a 2.4 m (7.9 ft) mirror and the focal length of 57.6 m (189 ft) and is placed outside the Earth's atmosphere. You'd need a large instrument with adaptive optics to get near this quality (assuming you can't afford to place a telescope in orbit). That said, it is possible for you to capture the polar ice caps on Mars using an amateur telescope. The quality of these will largely depend on the equipment you have and the location (atmospheric turbulence is very unforgiving if you use large magnifications) as well as the imaging technique. Here's a gallery of planet pictures taken by amateurs. You can find some photos of Mars in which the polar caps are visible. Regarding the Mars pictures you found on the Sky & Telescope website To answer your questions about this image, I see no reason to think it wasn't taken with an 8" telescope. However, there must have been more to it than just snapping a picture. According to the author, the photographs were taken using a Celestron 8" SCT telescope with a Meade 3x Telextender and Expanse 120 Camera. We're talking about a focal length of 2000 mm with 3x extender, which gives us 6000 mm. Not bad. The Expanse 120 is a CCD camera. Now, I'm not sure that's the case with these specific pictures but one way to reduce the impact of atmospheric turbulence is to record a video of a planet and stack the individual frames. Many of them will look very bad due to turbulence but occasionally, you'll get a better quality image. Selecting the best frames from a video and combining them into a single image can help you get a lot more detail. Have a look at this guide explaining how consumer-grade computer webcams can be used. It contains a neat comparison of a single frame and a stacked image. Please note that I'm merely speculating as to which techiniques could be used to obtain such images. I can see that the author posted their email on the S&T site and that there's a comments section as well. Feel free to ask them yourself.
