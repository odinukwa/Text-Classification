1. Ancient cultures observed the sky Night skies are naturally dark and there was no light-pollution in ancient times. So if weather permits, you can easily see a lot of stars. No need to tell about the Sun and the Moon. Ancient people had good reasons to study the night skies. In many cultures and civilizations, stars (and also the Sun and the Moon) where perceived to have religious, legendary, premonitory or magical significance (astrology), so a lot of people were interested in them. It did not took long to someone (in reality a lot of different people independently in many parts of the world) to see some useful patterns in the stars that would be useful to navigation, localization, counting hours, counting days and relating days to seasons, etc. And of course, those patterns in the stars were also related to the Sun and the Moon. So, surely all ancient cultures had people who dedicated many nights of their lifes to study the stars in detail right from the stone age. They would also perceive meteorites (falling stars) and eclipses. And sometimes a very rare and spetacular comet. Then there are the planets Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. They are quite easily to notice to be distinct from the stars because all the stars seems to be fixed in the celestial sphere, but the planets don't. They are very easily to notice to be wandering around in the sky with the passage of the days, specially for Venus, which is the brightest "star" in the sky and is also a formidable wanderer. Given all of that, the ancient people surely become very aware of those five planets. About Mercury, initially the Greeks thought that Mercury were two bodies, one that showed up only in the morning a few hours before the sunrise and another only a few hours after the sunset. However, soon they figured out that in fact it was only one body, because either one or the other (or neither) could be seen in a given day and the computed position of the unseen body always matched the position of the seen body. 2. The Earth seems to be round Now, out of the stone age, already into ancient times, navigators and merchants who travelled great distances perceived that the Sun rising and setting points could variate not only due to the seasonal variation, but also accordingly to the location. Also, the distance from the polar star to the horizon line also variates accordingly with the location. This fact denounces the existence of the concept nowadays known as latitude, and this was perceived by ancient astronomers in places like Greece, Egypt, Mesopotamia and China. Astronomers and people who dependend on astronomy (like navigators) would wonder why the distance from the polar star to the horizon varied, and one possibility was that it is because the Earth would be round. Also, registering different Sun angles in different locations of the world on a given same day and at a given same hour, also gives a hint that the Earth is round. The shadow on the Moon during a lunar eclipse also gives a hint that the Earth is round. However, this by itself is not a proof that the Earth is round, so most people would bet on some other simpler thing, or simply don't care about this phenomenon. Most cultures in ancient times presumed that the world was flat. However the idea of the world being round exists since the ancient Greece. Contrary to the popular modern misconception, in the Middle Ages, almost no educated person on the western world thought that the world was flat. About the Earth's size, by observing different Sun positions and shadows angles in different parts of the world, Erasthotenes in ancient Greece calculated the size of Earth and the distance between the Earth and the Sun correctly for the first time as back as the third century B.C. However, due to the confusion about all the different and inconsistent unit measures existent back then and the difficulty to precisely estimate long land and sea distances, confusion and imprecision persisted until the modern times. Ancient cultures also figured out that the shiny part of the Moon was illuminated by the Sun. Since the Full Moon is easily seen even at midnight, this implies that the Earth is not infinite. The fact that the Moon enters in a rounded shadow when exactly in the opposite side of the sky as the Sun also implies that it is the Earth's shadow on the Moon. This also implies that Earth is significantly larger than Moon. 3. Geocentrism So, people observed the Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn and the fixed sphere of stars all revolving around the sky. They naturally thought that the Earth would be the center of the universe and that all of those bodies revolved around the Earth. This culminated with the work of the phylosopher Claudius Ptolemaeus about geocentrism. Altough we now know that the ptolomaic geocentric model is fundamentally wrong, it could be used to compute the position of the planets, the Sun, the Moon and the celestial sphere of stars, with a somewhat acceptable precision at the time. It accounted to include the observation of planets velocity variations, retrograde motions and also for coupling Mercury and Venus to the Sun, so they would never go very far from it. Further, based on the velocity of the motion of those bodies in the sky, then the universe should be something like: 

Gases tries to occupy all the volume of the container in which they are encased in equilibrated pressure. This happens because the gas molecules are always colliding and kicking each other in a 3D high velocity brownian motion. The result is that the gas molecules occupies all the container's volume homogeneously. So, if the sealed container is opened up in space, the oxygen would quickly leak out, because the molecules near the vacuum edge would be instantaneosuly kicked out by the gas innermost molecules. This would happen rather quickly and in a chained manner, but is dependent on the size of the open hole. Macroscopically, the result would be that all the gas would be running out in a form of a wind/jet out of the open hole into outer space. This would only stop when all the molecules becomes too far apart from each other to have any further intermolecular interaction. This means that the oxygen (or any other gas) would be dissipated into outer space. The gas molecules would initially be spread out by the intermolecular collisions and then would go outwardly due to the momentum acquired from each individual gas molecule. When freed in outer space, each molecule would eventually reach something else to interact, so they could be attracted and retained by some gravity well (most likely from a planet or moon), or interact with some magnetosphere (if near a planet) or interact with some other molecule wandering around, or with a cosmic ray or be catched by the solar wind particles (or any of the equivalent if this happens near some other star). If this happens in intergalactic space where there is no body with appreciable gravity or magnetic field nearby, no stellar wind and the cosmic rays are very sparse and rare and the very few that exists are randomly directed, then the molecules would just spread out in virtually linear trajectories and travel the intergalactic space lonely, quietly and virtually undisturbed for some billions or trillions of years. In their journey, each molecule would only very occasionally interact with some other molecule (likely to be hydrogen) or some other lost particle wandering around. 

They are not exactly in the same plane, but roughly are. For example this graph representing the centaurs, the Kuipier belt and scattered disc objects show that most objects are around the same plane, with few objects with more than 30 degrees of inclination: 

Most of those bodies have a low inclination to the ecliptic, but Pallas is an interesting exception. I don't know why Pallas has such a high inclination but I would bet on a Kozai mechanism due to Jupiter's influence. Plutinos and Kuipier belt objects are influenced by Neptune, and part by the Kozai mechanism. Eris is a special and curious case, it is too far from Neptune, although there is still some weak gravitational Neptune's influence there, but I don't know why its inclination is so high. This contrasts with Sedna, which have a more reasonably lower inclination. Further, the Oort cloud is expected to be full of bodies of essentially unrestricted inclinations and possibly very excentric orbits, as a result of gravitational interactions with passing stars on the past. By the way, a passing star in a distant past might be an explanation for Eris orbit and inclination. Note: All of the data here, as well as both of the images, I found on wikipedia. 

For more details about sizes, check this page. About the transeptunian objects, only Pluto and Charon have a known appearance (due to being photographed by New Horizons). This way, all that you would need to draw in your tatoo beyond Pluto and Charon is a group of little spheres smaller than Pluto (I named 14 of them above), with only the one representing Eris with the same size as Pluto. Final note You will find images and further detailed information in the previous links, all of them points to wikipedia. I hope that you can get a perfect tatoo with that information! 

Again, few have more than 30 degrees of inclination. The planets are also all roughly in the same plane. Lets take the ecliptic as a reference (which is almost the same thing as Earth orbital's plane): 

[Not sure if I should answer this, but I will try to answer something while trying hard to not go off-topic.] The planets aspects Mercury surface is essentially a collection of small random craters with no discernible pattern at all, so you might not consider which side is presented. The only distinguished feature is a set of dark craters in its north pole. Venus features few discernible aspects in visible light to the human eyes. There are only a few and faint distinguishable cloud bands, so you might also not consider which side is presented. Earth is the most important, because it have continents and oceans with distinct designs. It also features a lot of clouds. Mars has polar caps and a system of canyons. It's northern hemisphere is also much less cratered and has a lower altitude than its southern hemisphere, except that the greatest crater is in the southern hemisphere. Jupiter has a banded structure of clouds covering the entire planet. It features a large red spot with some nearby fainter and smaller whiter spots. Saturn also has a banded structure, which is faintier to Jupiter's structure but still clearly visible. It also features a curious hexagon on its north pole. But it is barely noticeable. Uranus have very homogenous atmosphere (as seen in visible colors by human eyes), so it have almost no visible features to be drawn in your tatoo. Their presented side do not matters, because it is essentially a bland featureless ball. Neptune has also few visible features. There are no more than a few cloud bands with low variation on color or hue. However there is a dark spot. The rings Saturn has an extensive system of rings, which also contains some defined gaps. Jupiter, Uranus and Neptune also feature faint sets of rings (1, 2, 3). Uranus has a weird orientation, so its rings are not aligned with the orbital plane, but roughly perpendicular to it. The rotations All the planets rotates at different velocities, so any side of them would do. No planet is showing always the same face to any other planet or to the Sun. All of the planets, except Uranus, are rotating roughly in the same plane. So, their north is all pointing to a side and their south to another side (lets call those north/south axis Y). Their north-south axis is perpedicular to their planet-Sun axis (which we will call X). Uranus is special because at their summer/winter, its north/south axis points roughly to the Sun (i.e., in the X axis) and in its autumn/spring it is in a direction that is perpendicular to both X and Y (so it's the Z). Also, don't forget the Sun. It may also feature flares and sunspots sometimes. The Sun rotates in the same way as most of the planets, with its north/south axis along the Y direction. The moons You might also be tempted to include the planets moons. Those are:
