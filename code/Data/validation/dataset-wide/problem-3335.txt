Your teacher seems to have referred to a very elementary and partial account of auxiliaries popular in the 1960's that does happen to handle the example you cite, since be is not an auxiliary in that case but a 'main' verb, but is entirely inadequate to describe the complexity of English in this area and has long been superseded by much more detailed and precise theories. Nevertheless, you surely are aware that an English sentence may contain up to four auxiliary verbs, as in You could have been being followed by the police, where the first four 'verb-like' elements do belong to the class of auxiliaries, and elsewhere would satisfy all the relevant tests of auxiliarihood, but only the first one, the modal auxiliary could, which is finite/tensed, can be 'inverted' with the subject in the corresponding question or appear preceding not in the corresponding negative sentence. In such internally more complex sequences, the 'verbs' after could (aspectual have, aspectual be, and 'passive' be) are also 'auxiliaries', and could themselves be 'raised' to Tense/Infl and be 'inverted' across the subject in questions and precede negation if they appeared first and carried tense, but, as things are, they can do neither, because in an English simple clause only one 'verb' can be tensed, whichever is leftmost (= hierarchically higher). The following ones, if any, will carry non-finite inflections selected by whichever other auxiliary precedes them (i.e., 'zero' after modals, past participle -ed/-en after aspectual have, present participle -ing after aspectual be, and passive past participle after 'passive' be), and, as a consequence, will not qualify to appear under Tense/Infl (the head of the predicative part of the clause) nor be able to undergo 'subject-auxiliary inversion' (further movement of the tensed auxiliary from Tense/Infl into a higher head), or to appear before negation. Your question also reveals that you are, understandably, a bit confused by a terminological problem that arose in early Chomskian syntax: in early TGG (1950's and 60's), the label 'Aux' was used in two different ways: a) as a functional label for the node dominating all the auxiliary verbs a sentence contained, tensed or not (i.e., the 'auxiliary component' in opposition to the 'main verb phrase'), as in Chomsky's (1955) thesis, Syntactic Structures (1957), or when, even as late as in Aspects (1965), he continued to offer the PS rule Pred Phrase -> Aux + VP..., and b) in a more restrictive sense, to refer to whichever auxiliary carried tense and could invert with the subject, precede negation, and undergo a few other important 'transformations'. In the latter sense of 'Aux', the tree diagramme you show us is almost 'right' (ignoring that Aux and VP do form a unique constituent and should be dominated by a single node), since that sentence contains just one auxiliary, can, and, of course, can is finite, but you should not assign the same NP + Aux + VP structure to sentences like my You could have been being followed by the police: there is massive syntactic and semantic evidence that a sentence like that cannot have the structure [[You] + [could have been being] + [followed by the police]]! I suggest you consult some more recent English TG syntax textbook (maybe Haegeman & Guéron's English Grammar, or Radford's successive C.U.P. introductions, or Carnie's,... there are lots of them) to get a more up-to-date view of how the English auxiliary system is currently analysed, as well as of the syntactic, semantic, morphological, and phonological criteria by which English 'auxiliaries' can be distinguished from English 'main verbs'. 

I was looking at the Wikipedia page on the Wa Language and came across something strange in the consonant table: the consonants [mʰ], [nʰ], [ɲʰ], [ŋʰ], [rʰ], [jʰ], and [lʰ]. Not only are they aspirated nasals, trills, and approximants, which I have never seen before, but the IPA symbols represent voiced consonants, meaning they are both voiced and aspirated. It is very unlikely that they are meant to be breathy voiced, because there is a prenasalized breathy voiced series [ᵐbʱ] [ⁿdʱ] [ᶮɟʱ] [ᵑgʱ], as well as a breathy voiced fricative [vʱ], all of which have ʱ after them to clearly indicate that they are breathy voiced. What is the exact nature of these consonants? Are they voiced for the duration of the consonant's hold, voiceless for a brief period of time after the release, and then voiced again for the vowel? Are they simply meant to be voiceless aspirated like [m̥ʰ] or even just [m̥]? Or is the table even correct? No sources are given. 

My guess would be that you're simply hearing sounds or sound patterns that you're not used to hearing. Perhaps you've learned to recognize the distinct sounds of the uvulars /χ ʁ/ and the pharyngeals /ħ ʕ/, and you notice that instead of those sounds, you hear sounds that aren't quite the same - perhaps something easier for an English speaker to pronounce, but distinctly different in sound. Or perhaps it's the vowels. Perhaps you notice /e/ pronounced as [ɛ] or [ɛɪ̯], or /o/ pronounced as [əʊ̯] or [oʊ̯], or /a/ pronounced as [ɑ]. Or, perhaps the character's /i/ and /u/ were slightly diphthongized rather than being pure vowels. It could also be that what you're noticing isn't the quality of the speaker's phonemes, but his intonation or rhythm. I don't know much about Hebrew intonation or rhythm (nor did I know much about Hebrew's phoneme inventory, but that information is readily available on Wikipedia), but if Hebrew is a syllable-timed language, and the character you speak of is speaking as if it were a stress-timed language (like English), that would be pretty noticeable. Similarly, if he uses English intonation patterns that aren't common in Hebrew, then that could also be noticed. 

A complement to the answers above: The alphabet used for transcribing and the level of transcription are frequently confused. IPA can, just as any other alphabet, be used for both phonetic and phonemic transcription (the difference has already been neatly explained), or anything in between. One might argue IPA is richer, poorer, more or less readable, flexible, regular, whatever, but in principle there is nothing in it, or any other alphabet, that forces you to use it at any particular level of abstraction. Alphabet and level of abstraction are two independent variables. 

In native Turkic phonology, [k] and [ḱ] are allophones; [k] only occurs in a back environment, while [ḱ] only in a front environment. The same goes for [g] : [ǵ] and [l] : [ĺ], and no other consonant. Examples from Turkish: 

makes no sense if used alone, modifies the grammatical (syntactic, if you will) function of the word it is attached to, does not modify the semantics of the word it is attached to, and can be used with at least an entire group of words (see below). 

There are consonant alternations in Russian but they work in a somewhat different way than in Celtic, and therefore I'm not sure that it's a good idea to call them the same name, mutation. In short and off the top of my head, 

I suspect that the internal VP structure that Carnie presents in (28) corresponds to an early 1990's analysis of the 'event structure' of active VPs according to which such verbs contain an abstract ('do-like') 'active' component which is absent in the case of verbs describing non-agentive events (e.g., 'processes' like rain, bare 'change of state' verbs like die, or non-active 'accomplishment' verbs like reach in reach the summit, etc.). The basic idea is that the Agent of active verbs like eat is projected as a specifier of that [ACT] V head (i.e., under VP1) - instead of as a specifier of eat itself (under VP2) - or, more intuitively, that eat is the surface manifestation of a complex predicate meaning 'do eat' or 'perform an eating act'. Although that analysis immediately raises difficult theoretical questions like what, then, if anything, occupies the specifier of eat under VP2, or, if he is indeed first projected as the Spec of eat under VP2, what kind of thematic role it receives from eat and how can it subsequently raise into the specifier of the 'do-like' V under VP1 and receive a second? theta role (i.e., that of Agent) there, and why is that compatible with the Theta Criterion, etc., the fact is that there is some empirical evidence in support of that analysis. Pairs like * What you didn't was educate your son properly vs. What you did´t do was educate your son properly show that there is a do verb 'hidden' under active verbs that is different from the 'dummy' do auxiliary and shows up only in such contexts. The fact that non-agentive verbs like die, see, etc. cannot be used in that construction (cf. * What he didn´t do was die/see the accident) suggests that they do not 'contain' such a hidden 'active' do verb and therefore lends support to abstract analyses like Carnie's (initially due to Hale & Keyser, if I remember correctly, but very popular in the late 1990's; see e.g. Malka Rappaport Hovav & Beth Levin's influential 1998 paper 'Building Verb Meanings'). 

Actually, the traditional distinction between morphology and syntax is pretty clear. Morphology studies how words are inflected and new forms created, while syntax studies how they are combined into phrases and sentences. So, for example, do > does would be an issue in morphology while dog barks : does dog bark? would be an issue in syntax. The whole confusion arose in the Anglo-Saxon world because English expresses with syntax most of what non-analytic languages express with morphology. As long as the main objects of study for linguistis were Latin and Greek, I don't think anyone mixed the two terms. But after WW2 English became the dominant language and with it, the confusion spread. Linguists who are under weaker influence of American linguistics, however, i.e. those who did not study in an Anglo-Saxon country, or who do not specialize in theoretical linguistics, usually make a very clear distinction between syntax and morphology, often combined with looking down on those who don't. You ask if the distinction is meaningful. Absolutely. It is only in a purely analytic language that syntax can tackle the issues of morphology. But not even English is purely analytic, so if you stick to the traditional understanding, even in English there are problems (e.g. the formation of plural) that syntax can't deal with. It is only because there is so little morphology in English that the term syntax came to mean for Anglo-Saxons both syntax and morphology simultaneously. 

This is also based on information from Wikipedia, but Adyghe contrasts /ɕ/, /ʃ/, /ʂ/, /ʂʷ/, /ʃʼ/, and /ʃʷʼ/, and Kabardian contrasts /ʃ/, /ɕ/, and /ɕʼ/. 

Are breathy-voiced stops (like [dʱ]) only breathy-voiced during the closure, with the vowel being completely modal-voiced, or do they make the vowel begin breathy-voiced, the way an aspirated stop causes the vowel to begin voiceless? 

Is any language known to contain a glottal stop [ʔ] that isn't tenuis? For example, an aspirated glottal stop [ʔʰ], a palatalized glottal stop [ʔʲ], or a labialized glottal stop [ʔʷ]. CORRECTION: It turns out that tenuis is not the right word here. I mean glottal stops with a secondary feature, such as a aspiration or labialization. 

Put more visually: -- = Voiceless // = Modal-voiced ~~ = Breathy-voiced | = Release Voiced stops are: [////|////////] Tenuis stops are: [----|////////] Aspirated stops are: [----|---/////] So, are breathy-voiced stops [~~~~|////////] or [~~~~|~~~/////]? 

Many languages have diphthongs that end in [j], [w], [ɪ̯], [ʊ̯], and [ə̯], and sometimes diphthongs will end in [e̯] or [o̯], but besides Hmong's [aɨ̯], German's [ɔʏ̯], and all the weird diphthongs that some English dialects have going on (like [əʉ̯], [ɘʏ̯], [æɔ̯], etc.), what languages have diphthongs that end in other vowels, and why are diphthongs like [aɥ] and [aɰ] so uncommon in languages that have [y] and [ɯ]? 

I've never heard of any specific movement that would obligatorily accompany a specific word or phrase. However, especially if you count facial expression as movement, certain rhetoric strategies are, I believe, accompanied at least very often by movement. Sarcasm, mockery and such typically involve a specific intonation and facial expression. In that sense I can see how a certain phrase could begin to usually cooccur with a specific expression through being used primarily in an ironic sense. I suppose that this also accounts to a certain degree for the popularity of emoticons: without them it's often diffucult to decide if what one's reading is a joke or serious. I suppose yes and no might often come together with head movement but it's surely not a rule. On a theoretical ground, I can say this would be a relatively unlikely thing to happen, as being obviously redundant. The only scenario that comes to my mind that could lead to an obligatory cooccurrence, is with 'holy' or taboo words, where e.g. a certain movement could perhaps possibly be required in some culture when mentioning the name of a god, demon or something of the kind. 

Celtic mutations happen in anlaut and are petrified sandhi phenomena which may, at least in some cases, be the only carriers of morphological information nowadays (see the use of the Irish article an). Russian (Slavonic) alternations happen on morpheme boundaries, are a by-product of regular sound changes and can't carry morphological information on their own. Examples from Polish:
