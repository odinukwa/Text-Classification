The video's depiction is, of course, quite wrong. Commius was an envoy of Caesar during his 55 and 54 BC invasions. He eventually switched sides during the uprising of the Gauls, but fled to Britain after being defeated in 51 BC. So, even if we count his Belgic kingdom as part of Rome, it definitely wasn't in existence during Caesar's invasions. 

British policy on the continent has traditionally been to maintain the balance of power (this is also really a general European thing). This amounted to shifting alliances all over the continent. Though France and Britain are "traditional" enemies (as neighbours were wont to be in Europe), they certainly hadn't been at war for anywhere near "close to 1000 years". In fact Britain allying with France isn't that unusual. England supported the League of Cognac, an alliance of France and some Italian states against Germany and was close to joining. Britain and France were on the same side against Spain several times, including the War of Portuguese Succession, the Carlist War, and the War of the Quadruple Alliance. In the 17th century there was an abortive alliance under the Protectorate. In the 18th century another alliance was relatively successful against Russians. And in the 19th century, Anglo-French troops fought together against Russia in the Crimean War. A key change after the mid-19th century is the emergence of Germany as the continent's dominant military, economic and industrial power. This is particularly demonstrated by her victory over France in 1870. It was pretty natural for Britain to seek counterbalancing allies. 

Gouverneur Morris pointed out that judges could well void the proposed Constitution for not adhering to the Articles of Confederation's mandated alteration procedures requiring the consent of every legislature. This view was shared by James Madison. But neither challenged judges over the power of judicial review; instead, both argued that if the people supported the constitution then the judges would not object. It is difficult to imagine that no one would speak out against judicial review, if it was not already understood by all to be an established legal doctrine. In fact, the closest the Philadelphia Convention came to rejecting the doctrine of judicial review, actually helps established what I have written earlier: that the concept of judicial review was a legal doctrine established by then. 

(Map of the Early Zhou Dynasty. Circled dots represent "states" established by the Zhou royal court. These were similar in nature to the cities states (or colonies thereof) of Europe during classical antiquity.) 

Broadly speaking, the oldest known wood structure remains in Britain is some 10,000 years old, and Stonehenge is thought to have had wooden poles. Rope making is apparently even older. It might thus be reasonable to guesstimate that tying an animal to a post occurred to our ancestors fairly early. 

Because it didn't have a choice: it had neither the will to defy the British Government, nor the ability to do so. Remember corporations are not people; its shareholders and directors were. In this case, most of them were British, owning properties and with aspirations in Britain. That alone made resisting a duly constituted Act of Parliament by force entirely out of the question. Politically speaking, the Government of India Act 1858 was passed in the aftermath of the Indian Rebellion of 1857. After that disaster, Company rule of India came to be seen as wildly inadequate. This was after decades of concerns for mismanagement and corruption of Company rule. By 1858, there was simply no political support left for maintaining the East India Company. The reality is that by 1858, India under Company rule was actually controlled by the British Government. Desite the name and facade, the British government had already decisively inserted itself into the governance of India. Thefore, the British Government of India was hardly going to rebel against itself over a reorganisation. Now, the nationalisation in 1858 did not appear out of a vacuum. Rather, it was the culmination of a takeover process spanning almost a century: 

Naturally, these early Indo-Europeans carried their culture with them as they moved, including religion. The ancient Proto-Indo-European pantheon developed into Greek, Roman, Germanic, Slavic, and Indo-Aryan gods. Your teacher's example was in fact their prehistoric god of the sky and chief deity, DyÄ“us ph2ter. He went on to become: 

Two other points were also generally deemed unacceptable but "accepted" by Serbia: in the suppression of the subversive movement directed against the integrity of the Monarchy; 

It is agreed that Yona meant Greek and that A'lasadda referred to Alexandria, but it isn't altogether clear which Alexandria. It seems scholars generally think it refers to the Alexandria of Bactria or the Alexandria of Arachosia. Alternatively, and I don't think anyone advocates this except the dubious Arthur Lillie, but it might also possibly be the Alexandria of Ptolemaic Egypt. 

Like most early Indian trading firms operating in South Africa, Dada Abullah & Co. went into rapid decline after the turn of the century.[1] The firm's founder and principal partner, Abdullah Haji Adam Jhaveri (i.e. Dada Abdullah) did not have any sons to succeed him, while his sole daughter was married in India. Thus, upon his death in 1912, the firm appears to have been dissolved.[2] This obviously long predates both the Second World War and the Great Depression. 

The martyr to the Socialist cause was Eugene V. Debs, a founder of the IWW and former presidential candidate of the Socialist Party. In 1918 he was charged under the Espionage Act over a speech in which he praised some allies (Charles Baker, Alfred Wagenknecht, Charles Ruthenberg) who had already been imprisoned under the Espionage Act. A week after the war ended in victory for the Allies, Debs was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment. Another notable case was German-American moderate Victor Berger, the first Socialist representative elected to Congress. In 1919 he was convicted of opposing the war and sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment by vocal anti-German Kenesaw Landis. Having already been elected to the House of Representatives, Berger was thus blocked from his seat for having "engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the [United States], or given aid or comfort to the enemies." Wisconsin re-elected him in a special election, only for Congress to bar him again. More blatant suppression of the Socialist Party followed in 1920. In a dramatic breach of the democratic principle, the New York State Assembly voted overwhelmingly to expel five duly elected members over their Socialist affiliation. All five were subsequently re-elected, and once again expelled. The Assembly then passed a law banning the Socialist Party altogether, though the Governor vetoed it. 

In other words, when the Romans claim to be the "victims", it doesn't mean they were actually victimised in any sense of the word that you'd recognise today. 

Gaykhatu Khan's paper money was visually similar to the contemporary Chinese notes. It was an oblong certificate, block printed on possibly papyrus or bark paper. The Islamic creed of Shahada was printed at the top, followed by Gaykhatu's name, as Irinjin Turji, in Arabic. The denomination was printed at the centre of the note, and encircled. Beneath this was inscribed a disclaimer: 

We also have several eyewitness accounts from his presidency involving Reagan denying being racist in private conversations. For instance, Carl Rowan reports of a lunch with Reagan in 1988 during which the president said: 

For reference, each mu of land (the basic land tax unit) had a basic production level of at least 2 dan of rice or equivalent each year. Other taxes such as customs were also low at only 1/30, or 3.33%. Therefore, the nominal tax value was in fact extremely low, especially in comparison to the double digit income tax of modern western societies. Relatively speaking, these taxes represented a 50% increase over regular government revenues. However, this is due to how incredibly low normal taxes were. The subsequent Manchurian dynasty of Qing levied taxes of up to 5 candareen per mu, for example.

Vivekananda laid the groundworks for Yoga in the West, but piqued academic curiosity more so than general interest. It took until the mid 20th century for Yoga to become generally popular, accompanied by rising general interest in Eastern cultures. 

This passage confirms that the English populace was still habitual meat eaters. However, despite arguing it is better to eat more meat in colder climates, Dr Graham strongly advocated a more vegetarian diet in tropical regions as well (and summer), Graham's book was sufficiently popular to go through 11 editions. Missionaries and colonists carried it, and other books like it, to the far-flung dominions of the British Empire. Thus the early 19th century appears to be a period when new knowledge on the healthiness of vegetables was introduced to traditional eating habits. Although nutritional science was in its infancy, attempts were being made to understand healthy eating habits. For example, Bernstein, Aaron David devoted a chapter explaining the "wise instinct" of housewives in serving vegetables and fruits, in his successful Popular Books on Natural Science: For Practical Use in Every Household, for Readers of All Classes. This was translated into English during the 1860s. 

Consequently, when it became technically feasible to produce them, plate armour quickly replaced mail for those who can afford it. Obviously, plate armour could only protected whatever it actually covered. It was thus completely logical for the armour to extend downwards to the whole foot. Another contributing factor, mentioned in the above quote, is that larger shields had generally fallen out of favour by this period. Due to their unwieldiness, they were considered more impedance than help on the battle field. This however meant that the lower legs, especially for mounted troops, were particularly vulnerable and requires separate protection. In contrast, the earlier kite shields, such as those depicted in the Bayeux Tapestry, were much bigger and elongated. This meant they could be used to shield the lower legs.. In fact, this wasn't the first time shields affected the use of greaves. In Ancient Rome, 

This trade coincides with a growing occurrence of Japan in Korean records, and vice versa in Japan's. The Seven Branched Sword, which is believed to be the same artifact that featured in the Chronicles of Japan as a gift from Baekje to Empress Jingu also dates to around this time. 

[3] i.e., "the island of Brazil beyond the western part of Ireland." [4] The coasts of Newfoundland and Northeastern America in general were excellent fisheries with significant commercial value well into the early modern era. Fish caught would be salted and dried on the islands before being shipped back (the reason why France retained Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon in the Treaty of Paris, as late as 1763). 

Hence, note that the first photo is dated December 1970, three months after the notorious simultaneous hijacking terrorist attack in September of that year. In all likelihood you're looking at security measures introduced in direct response to thay attack. Likewise, it's telling that the second example is labelled Zurich-Kloten in 1970. No doubt the depicted security measures were deployed in reaction to the Palestinian terrorist attack that occurred on its runways in 1969. Both photos are plausibly dated and I see no reason to suspect the captions to be incorrect. As for the third example from Atlanta, the uploader likely found the photo from the Atlanta History Center. The image was posted to their tumblr account just a few days before the Reddit thread. Note that the date is officially given as "c. 1960", not 1960 exactly as claimed (one suspects the Redditor did not realise what the abbreviation means). Most likely the photo actually does postdates the 1961 hijacking, though I was unable to verify this. According to the Atlanta History Center, the photographer is called Bill Wilson, and the woman is named as Linda Fay, both of whom seems to have passed. The official description given by the collection is "View of Linda Fay reacting to the first airport security instrument tested at the Atlanta Municipal Airport (now Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport) in Atlanta, Georgia." 

While we cannot be certain what Pytheas might be referencing here, there are several islands to the north of mainland Britain, such as Shetland or Iceland. We also understand today that the Gulf Stream enables northern Europe to be warmer than it would have been given its nearness to the North Pole. Unaware of these facts, however, Strabos saw this as proof that Pytheas was a liar. Lastly, Strabo cites Polybius in disbelieving that Pytheas was capable of what he reported to have achieved. 

Yes, sort of. Illiterate people could "sign" using hand prints, which is a reasonably reliable biometric (totally anecdotal, but my university's experience was <10% false identification) that's a bit easier to authenticate by the naked eye. Prints of the finger (more than just the tip) could also be authenticated based on feature such as lengths between joints. 

The British East India Company raised three forces between 1740-1757. These became known as the Presidency Armies, named after the three Presidencies in India under Company rule. They were the: 

In addition to the Via Domitia passes, the other theory is that Hannibal crossed at the Col de Perche in the Central Pyrenees. This route, through the basin of the Segre as mentioned in the question, would indeed bring Hannibal close to Andorra, as the question's alternative hypothesis argues. However, it makes relatively less sense for Hannibal to choose this unnecessarily difficult path. The main arguments for this route is that Hannibal may have chosen it so that he could defeat the nearby tribes. The military and strategic benefits of such a move is dubious, though. If the Carthaginians had any hopes for maintaining a logistical link to Spain, it was dashed within months. 

The context is that, during the Chu's conquest of Deng, two royal princes beat up and robbed an old man when he refused to hand his basket over. To the shock of his courtiers, King Wen ordered them executed. The passage above is the king's explanation for his order. Note that "punishing the immoral" refers to the war against Deng, as that was a common casus belli at the time. Not a perfect example since it's only a specific kind of violence, and doesn't explicitly mention doing it in front of the children. That said, if beating an old man was bad enough merit executions for the sake of the children even if they weren't watching, one presumes the king wouldn't approve of doing it in front of the children either. 

This is recorded in the History of the Three Kingdoms, written in A.D. 1145. The same document reports sporadic skirmishes with the Japanese until the second century, when contact (including envoys) became more regular. 

First, because non-proliferation was seen as a positive step towards nuclear disarmament. Nuclear war does not just affect involved combatant; the nuclear fallout from a sizeable exchange would be a global ecological disaster. At the height of the Cold War, the threat of nuclear holocaust was a very real concern. This meant most smaller states had a compelling interest in stemming/reversing the the tide of nuclear arming. 

You observed correctly. The Second Temple was built upon Temple Mount. Around 20 B.C., King Herod the Great lavishly renovated the site, and in the process endowed the hill with a retaining wall. This structure became the only remnants of the Second Temple after its destruction in A.D. 70, most famously in the form of the Wailing Wall. In fact, however, Herod's walls encircled the whole of Temple Mount, and these formed parts of Jersualem's city walls. 

The short answer is that it didn't. Monarchies did not become more common, and Europe in general did not adopt absolutist rule, immediately after the fall of Rome. First, to answer your literal question, monarchies were already common before Rome fell. 

Note: During times of siege, livestock were often sheltered within the castle grounds, and slaughtered as needed for food. This was not exactly a sustainable source of food, however, nor could it feed an entire garrison for any length of time. 

The Ancient Egyptians had a great number of ways for saying "soldier". The hieroglyphs that have a significance meaning soldier as a determinative were: 

When the nascent United States was drafting and adopting its supreme laws, several references to religion were made. For example, in the Bill of Rights: 

As the other answer and comments pointed out, all three Baltic states fought to resist the Soviet re-occupation after 1944. The Lithuanian effort were relatively more determined, costing the Lithuania about as many lives as the rest of the Baltic resistances. More importantly, however, during this period Lithuania was slower in its economic development compared to both Estonia and Latvia, as a result of reduced investment levels.
