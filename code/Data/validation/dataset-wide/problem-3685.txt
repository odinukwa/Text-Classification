You are working out plenty. Resistance training 5x a week along with cardio 5x a week is more than enough exercise. As a general rule I'd suggest focusing more on big, free weight movements (squats/deadlifts/bench/press), but that's not really the core of the issue here. If your goal is to lose weight, you have to take in fewer calories. Protein shakes aren't a bad thing, but if you add a protein shake to your current diet, you're just tacking on extra calories - you'll gain more weight. You need to eat less, snack less, and don't drink your calories. You should really be drinking mostly water if you aren't already. As was previously suggested, keep track of everything you take in via something like MyFitnessPal or FitDay. You might be surprised by the amount of calories you're actually taking in - and that's where you need to start if you want to lose weight. 

Prevents you from burning calories? I certainly haven't heard anything like that. I suppose their theory is that if your core temperature remains higher, your heart rate will also remain higher? Or are they saying that by taking a cold shower your body has to work harder to regain that body temp? Either way, I have a hard time believing that the temperature of your shower drastically impacts the amount of calories you burn either way. 

Everyone's body is a little difference. The squat and the deadlift might use a lot of the same muscles, but if you have longer arms and a stronger posterior chain, there's a good chances that you'll be proportionally better at the deadlift. Similarly, since the bench press focuses more on the chest whereas the overhead press focuses on shoulders, depending on where you're stronger, you can easily be off. However, as has already been posted, the exrx strength standards (also found in various Rippetoe books) are at least a starting point. 

One unexpected thing that worked very well for my trapeziums was carrying a heavy backpack during my University days. I had a business-styled backpack with a flat back, with firm, comfortable and thin belts that would use the clavicle as hook and place all the weight from the backpack on the shoulder, which I believe wasn't designed for the heavy load I had to carry around. I generally carried around ~15kg/~33lbs: my 17'' laptop, it's AC adapter and a lot of heavy books. Every day, I would stand for several hours and spend an hour or two walking in a fast pace. I would consider this as a supplement to your shoulder exercises. I had sore muscles the first month, but afterwards I wouldn't ever even notice the load I was carrying and it felt I could go for much much more before I'd feel any strain. 

The breakdown of muscles is metabolically triggered under circumstances when the body begins to break down proteins for generating glucose as an energy source in response to starvation. The chemical markup required to trigger such a pathway is complex, but usually, before that, it is likely that you would have switched to more readily available source of energy for metabolism, such as ketones from fats, potentially breaking down the fat tissues surrounding your organs, such as the heart, which can be disastrous when your diet is not managed by a professional. In all, it can be easily said that if you do have a nutrition you shouldn't be worried. That said, if you do being to reduce readily available sources of energy, you may trigger different chemical pathways that may begin to regulate how muscle cells are killed and disassembled (in response to damage, for instance), which can be desirable under circumstances, though these are questions best directed towards biochemists, trained nutritionists, but certainly not fitness trainers. If you want a loose recommendation, then make sure you have a steady calorie intake of carbohydrates that are easily ingested and that you have healthy gut flora. I wouldn't recommend relying too much on proteins, even though they may be converted to glucose, as they're a poor source of calories and you can safely ingest only a limited amount as part of a healthy diet. 

There's no way you've hit any sort of limit after three months. Keep at it. If you aren't increasing any more, it's very possible that you're overtrained - you're doing a lot of volume. Also, if your goal is to lift more weight, I would recommend doing heavier weights and fewer reps. You build strength in the 3-5 rep range, and honestly, if you're "comfortable" you aren't pushing hard enough. I'm not saying you should try dangerous weight you can't handle, or use poor form, or go to exhaustion every set - I'm just saying that it shouldn't be easy. 

Most people have misconceptions what 'tone', what it is, and how to achieve it. Being toned is a combination of two things - having muscle mass, and having a low enough amount of body fat to show the definition between the aforementioned muscles. A six pack is simply satisfying these conditions in a specific area - the stomach. Lifting If you're 6'1 152, and without visible abs, I would presume you have limited muscle mass. I realize you don't want a bodybuilder look, but 1/2 of the formula for being "toned" is having muscle on your frame. You need to lift weights like you're trying to get big - just don't eat like you're trying to get big. You can lift like a bodybuilder or a powerlifter for years but without a certain caloric volume, you aren't going to get that big. Drop the machines and add in the big lifts - you need to be doing squats, deadlifts, presses, weighted pullups, etc. Also, these big exercises, when done properly, work your core very hard, which helps to build muscle necessary for a six pack. The prior advice that you should stop lifting so much if you start getting too big is just incorrect - keep lifting big, just don't eat as much. Diet Which brings us to the next half of the equation - diet. While on the surface what you posted doesn't look bad, the devil is in the details. You need to really know how many calories you're taking in, how much protein, etc. For a couple of weeks, track everything you ingest with something like FitDay, MyFitnessPal, etc. Get an idea for how many calories you're taking in, and how many you're burning. Only then can you really know if your diet is properly aligned with your goals. Ab exercises People tend to work under the assumption that in order to get a six pack, you need to do tons of ab work - crunches, lifts, planks, rollouts, you name it. Realistically, this isn't the case. Yes - as my definition at the top states, you need to have muscle mass to show stomach tone. However, most people that don't have a six pack simply have too much fat. Everyone's metabolism is different, and everyone's body accumulates fat differently. People like to throw out 'magic' numbers of body fat percentage where abs can be seen - these are general guidelines. Some people can have visible abs above 10%, some might need to get down to 7%. The real key is to just keep reducing fat until you get where you want to be - and remember, you cannot spot reduce fat. There is no exercise or diet that will cause you to lose more stomach fat than others. In the long run, you need to lose body fat to get the six pack you want. This requires a caloric deficit, but it also requires more focus on lifting to ensure that your body is burning fat, not muscle. In the short term, you may find it beneficial to focus more on building a baseline of muscle, without focusing as much on the caloric deficit. You will gain weight in this phase, but most of it should be muscle. Following some muscle gains, switch to a caloric deficit, cut the fat away, and you'll have the definition you want. 

Treat every daily session as push up practice, rather than a workout with pushups in it. What you're going for, especially in the early stages, is getting all the correct muscles to contract and inhibit in perfect harmony (while eventually strengthening the muscle fibers at play). At this point, it's closer to learning a new dance move than it is "exercising". Once you get to the 20-25 range (I know it's arbitrary, but 20-25 is a solid foundation to build on...at my age, it would be enough to meet the minimum Army PFT push up score), start playing with different push up variations. Honestly, just Google "push up variations", and experiment. Use these new variations to program a path to your goals; whether they be strength, muscular endurance, or hypertrophy (muscle growth). If you want to just keep on bumping up your max count (like...I don't know...100+) at this point, I recommend a program designed specifically for doing a lot of push ups. Stew Smith is a master in this domain. He has a lot of different programs to help US military ace their fitness tests, but here's a relevant free one: Stuck on Pushups? Try the Pushup Push Workout! I tried the above myself (along with pull ups), and had very solid results (went from 51 to 64 in two weeks). I wouldn't recommend this without a strong foundation, and he says to only do this once, maybe twice a year; he's serious...it's taxing, but it's a great plateau killer. Here's a write up on my results if you're interested: Over 20% Push Up and Pull Up Gains in 14 Days Using Stew Smithâ€™s Program Be patient and consistent and the results will come. 

You can definitely work out twice a day, generally speaking. If you're talking about light-to-moderate aerobic sessions and split resistance training, you shouldn't have much to worry about. I'm assuming that you're not focused on any sport-specific performance training, or worried about fine tuning gains for an upcoming bodybuilding competition. If you're just a dude looking to get/stay fit, your main concern with two-a-days should be avoiding fatigue. Again, it doesn't sound like you're at risk with the type of programming you noted, but there are multiple ways to monitor your central nervous system (CNS) to make sure aren't taxing it too heavily:
