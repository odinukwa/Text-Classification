Quality alcohol is probably one of the most important commodities you'd find in a post-apocalyptic barter economy. Why? 

Another possible answer to add to the above from the bleeding edge of science: zombificatian/hibernation. Yes, this is a real thing. DARPA is experimenting with extending the "golden hour" between severe trauma and successful medical care. As part if that, they've discovered that they can put rats into suspended animation for long periods of time after losing 90% of their blood and still successfully bring them back to life for transfusion. It basically involves quickly shutting down the normal body process of death by replacing oxygen with another gas. Rather than standard apoptosis, the body enters a suspended animation state. They haven't done this with people yet, but it is currently working with animals. Your character could be one of the first human test subjects. Source: Wired article on zombie pigs 

It seems like your tech level is "near future," since you're talking about spaceships and energy weapons but they still need a seaside port for shipping goods. This implies that they probably have a fairly limited energy budget (since otherwise they'd just send everything via plane/spaceship). The most straightforward idea for a simple barrier against sea bound monsters would be a series of propellers anchored to the bedrock pushing a strong current away from the shore. A unidirectional current like that could be difficult enough for individual creatures to overcome without completely nullifying the threat. Mind you, there'd still need to some circulation bringing water behind these blades, possibly creating a weakness to be exploited in the narrative. Portions of the barrier could be shut down to allow passage of ships into the city. The outward current could also boost ships leaving the port past the "danger zone" at a higher speed. Tl,Dr; a strong current away from shore created by spinning propellers of death should be a functional and efficient deterrent without completely eliminating the threat. It also creates interesting narrative opportunities. 

An enemy "soft" enough to let bullets/projectiles through sounds like it would do the trick. If you have some sort of "hive entity" like the nano-bots in Big Hero 6, shooting isn't going to do a whole lot. Cleaving through a limb would sever it's connection to the rest of the hive, though. So guns and lasers are mostly useless. Bomb shrapnel would pass through them, though the force of the explosion might disperse them a bit. Swords and other bladed slashing weapons are the only real offense against such a creature. 

With no moon, no inclination, and no seasonality, there's no reason to distinguish planetary rotation about the sun (although an elliptical orbit would still produce seasons, albeit almost unnoticeable...) They might make "weeks" based off of digits-either five for one hand, ten for both hands, or twenty for fingers and toes. Finger/toe counting of days is always accessible, and might form their "month," but there are more useful measures. In all likelihood, they would measure time by crop plantings (I was born thirty harvests ago) or some regular weather event. That would easily happen once they reach some agricultural milestones. From there, they begin to abstract: I will pay you in two harvest's time, this house costs two bushels every harvest cycle, etc. So "months" become some predictable harvest cycle, perhaps for grain "Years" might be a longer growing plant's harvest cycle, such as nuts, which is expressed as a multiple of months: "There are ten wheat harvests for each nut harvest." Or it would be the time it takes for a tree to viably produce its first harvest. This would make it an important economic marker: "I will pay you back when I have my orchard grown" is expressed as "I'll pay in one tree." So someone would say: "I am thirty nuts/trees and five wheat old." 

I would like to modify the answer provided by @ArtOfCode - While we can presently freeze bodies, the re-animation process is still not fully possible, and even if/when it becomes feasible, it will be quite some time until we'll be able to send a ship into space for a 10,000 year journey that they'll be able to reliably wake up from. It is far easier to freeze embryos and keep them viable for a long period of time. It's actually in the realm of current commercially available technology (albeit at a relatively smaller scale and for shorter spans of time). We have also been working extensively on building cellular scaffolds for the purposes of observing cells in an in vivo environment. My proposed addendum is as follows: 

Basically, they're the counterpart to humans in the Otherworld, possessing a similar but opposite duality. In our plane of existence we only perceive them as inhuman zombies, much like in theirs a human soul would be like a ghost - spirit without substance. The precise nature and form of these creatures would depend on how much fun you want to have with the mechanics. A particularly powerful undead might inhabit the recently deceased, while less fortunate ones might become poltergeist inhabiting inanimate objects. A war between the gods (or their servants) and the resulting casualties might result in particularly powerful undead who manifest physically purely through force of will. Regardless, these undead might not be malicious, could well be beneficent, or even be "suicidal," trying to end the "soulless" portion of their existence as quickly as possible. 

I'm going to have to disagree with Monty on this one. While the wings would be added weight and would potentially create more drag, comparing bird biology to biplanes is downright folly. Consider that almost all flying insects use multiple pairs of wings to produce lift. Flies not only have ridiculous acrobatic ability due to their ability to swing their wings independently, they also move at a relatively high speed when measured in body lengths. A dual wing bird alternately flapping pairs would more quickly gain altitude - while one pair is in the up-stroke, the other would be engaged in the lift generating down-stroke. When gliding or surfing an updraft, the extra pair of wings would provide much more lift like the delta wing of fighter jets and gliders. This gives them more maneuverability and a higher stall angle. So not only would a four winged bird generate more consistent flapping power, it would be a better glider, climber, and diver. The trade off would be weight and noise - assuming they are noisy; owls are pretty quiet. 

Ship suspended animation gametes rather than any currently living humans. DARPA can already place rats in temporary stasis, so single cells should be easy. Upon landing on planet and setting up shop, use a robotic 3-d printer to craft scaffoldings for a roboticized human uterus. Since we can directly control design factors, we can easily eliminate any issues surrounding the birthing canal and general integrity of the womb. Combine the gametes together to get in vitro oocytes. Seed the robo-uteruses with stem cells cultivated from your oocytes. Feed the uteri with blood produced by stem cells cultivated into blood producing marrow. Keep the cells alive during growth with a nutrient chemical bath. Now you have a functioning human womb ready to accept a viable embryo! I guess, lastly, have some sort of caretaking robot that can help ensure the newly born, parentless humans don't perish until they can start learning to take care of themselves. Also, they need to be taught language and learn to read wikipedia. Caretaking robots for the elderly are already in limited existence. This is an extension and expansion of that same concept. 

To add to all of this: We already have machines that can outrun us, out-bowl us, and outthink us, but we still have competitions for running, bowling, and chess. Heck, they can even play some music better, provided they're properly programmed. Robots taking over menial jobs (hiring a roomba instead of a janitor) just means we can spend more time either competing with each other on trivial things (read: everything) or WATCHING people compete at trivial things. Humans excel at that... 

While attempting to press their advantage, the sponsored terrorists will go too far. The defending country gets tired of world inaction, snaps, and launches an all-out assault on the sponsoring country. 

Well, the ability for us to see infra-red (direct visual perception of heat) would enable quite a few things: 

Boredom, mostly. After a certain amount of time, people get malaise. Everything seems old and "already done." There are only so many sunsets you can watch before it loses the emotional power. People are always willing to sacrifice for something that feels broader and more important than themselves. Then there's the fact that even when we're immortal, we're still human beings who are prone to all sorts of emotional imbalances. People can be angry, bloodthirsty, psychopathic... You'd much rather some of those people be soldiers than wreaking havok in the general population. It's likely that you'd experience a lull in recruiting of a couple hundred years as the first immortals lived their lives to the fullest, but eventually your recruitment would fill with gods weary of this mortal shell and eager to experience the unparalleled thrill of death. Addendum: What if people fought wars AGAINST immortality? They specifically saw that the immortal life had some severe unintended consequences for people, culture, and society (why get anything done when you can procrastinate literally forever?) and knew that the only way to save our humanity was to destroy immortality? So you have the "perfect immortals" being fought by those demanding a mortal imperfect life as the purer human experience... 

Lab Report: Subject Armadillo I am please to report that the subject has been positively responding to the gene therapy. The real breakthrough was using CRISPR to edit the ossification gene to activate only upon external oxidative scabbing rather than internal inflammation. The platelets seed an osteon at the site of the wound that develops into a sesamoid bone. As a result of picking at their skin, subject has developed bone studding over the outside of their body. These sesamoids have a higher than average ratio of compact to cancellous bone tissue. While the development of this lamellar bone is slow, it is exceedingly durable. In an interesting development, where the sesamoid bone meets the skin a second collagen coat has developed. Rather than the usual alternating parallel sheets of collagen, subject seems to be developing "woven" patches that function much like kevlar with the bones embedded in this matrix. This appears to allow a much more efficient dispersal of impact, functioning much like the recently deployed Dragon Skin vests. While the density of the bone does add to the subject's weight, it has not seemed to slow them down. Additionally, the nature of the bone plating does not seem to impede flexibility or range of motion. We estimate that when fully optimized, the exoskeleton and energy dispersal system would theoretically be capable of at least a Gigapascal of compressive force (a sixfold increase) while simultaneously minimizing exposure to the more fragile tensile or shear forces. At that point, the dissipating collagen mesh should be able to disperse the force of heavy weaponry without damaging the internal organs of the subject. Unfortunately, test subject has proven overly belligerent and have begun to grow bone "claws" as a result of scraping at the walls. They've hospitalized three guards this month. Below is an updated schedule of Project Anthromegalous: Subject Armadillo - Bone exoskeleton. Proof of Concept. Scheduled for demolition Subject Bison - Genetic enhancements for increased physical performance Subject Camel - Adaptive resistance Hopefully by then we will have cracked the code on rapid cellular regeneration to enable Project Anthromegalous to go toe to toe with that self-righteous alien. At that point, we will proceed with Subject Doomsday... 

Inspired by this article about the recent discovery of a subsurface ocean. So now we know it has a liquid water ocean and a magnetic field. The subsurface ocean is also protected from radiation by the surrounding crust. There were two potential resolutions to the auroral shift observations of the Hubble: Either a thinner pure water band or a thicker, saltier band of water. Perhaps both exist simultaneously like they do on Earth? Of the two options, which would be more conducive to the formation of life? I assume the more saline version would encourage more chemical interactions but I don't know. In either case, what sort of ecosystem would we expect to evolve in this non-photosynthetic, magnetic, underground sea world? What would be key "feeder" species for a food chain? 

This would coerce the world into broader military intervention. Whichever country is indirectly sponsoring the terrorists would fall out on their side, "arguing for mediation and localized conflict." If this works, it will probably will end up with the creation of an "independent state" under de facto control of the sponsor, effectively winning the war for them. If not, then they would send in material ground support. The US and EU would probably end up on the side of the defenders, at the very least to put themselves in opposition against China and Russia. Any deployment of troops by them would be countered by US forces for the other side. We would end up in a "Warm War," not yet a full hotzone, and more actual military action than the Cold War. The tipping point would come when the sponsored separatists/terrorists get ahold of a mini-nuke. Where it will come from is irrelevant. It might have been from a previously uninvolved country (such as Iran) trying to "stir the pot." With all the major world powers focused on the India/Pakistani border, a nuclear explosion at a military base containing foreign forces would throw everything into terrible, terrible conflict. And here's why that's frightening: nuclear weapons, once used, broaden the field of war. The first use of nukes gives a "pass" to a retalliatory strike. And in this case, the retalliation will be against PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T EVEN USE OR SUPPLY THE NUKES, but no one at that point will believe them. Why this is plausible: It could even be done intentionally by, say, a nuclear Iran (or any other middle eastern nuclear power) in hopes that the larger powers would rip each other apart, basically initiating their own eschatology via nuclear war! Basically, the Far East will erupt into a war between all world powers, with the most of the middle east snickering at the side, glad to be left out of it this time. In conclusion, I'll just leave this here: $URL$
