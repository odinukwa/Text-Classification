It is possible, but not likely economically a good move, especially if you're not doing the labor to swap the bike parts yourself (assuming you own the tool to remove the bottom bracket and what not). The bike is a relatively cheap one (~300 dollars), and you're likely to come out better financially by selling the bike and buying a larger one (which may have some slightly different components spec'd on it, such as different crank arm lengths). 50 cm -> 58 cm is quite a large jump as well, but that is a peripheral point. 

What you are talking about are extension or suicide levers, which were common in the 70s. These were poorly designed -- they basically keep the cable tension for the brakes partially on, so you don't get the full ability to actuate the brakes. Modern bicycles have interrupter levers, which push the housing rather than pull on the cable to activate the brakes. They don't have the drawbacks of suicide levers, and you can effectively apply the brake from the interrupter lever or from the regular brake lever. The brake you use depends on your hand position. For example, if you're on the top of the brake hoods or drops, you'd probably use the regular drop bar brake levers. If you're near the middle of the bar, you'd probably use the interrupter lever. The hand position is a matter of personal preference (nobody's stopping you from riding only in the drops all the time), but depending on how you're riding, some of the levers will be natural one to use. If you're having issues with reaching the brakes, you can swap on a modern set of brake levers, and even add interrupter levers if you want to. Some levers come in smaller sizes for smaller hands (e.g. Tektro RL341 are a smaller hand version of the RL340). 

If you have a linear pull system (i.e. V-brakes), you need to have a long pull lever (*). V-brakes look like this: 

This is probably more complicated than you think it is. This depends on your bike. A lot of bikes which are spec'd with say 42t front chainrings for the big ring can't clear a 50t big ring in the front without the chain interfering with something. You'll also have to worry about chain line and possibly installing something to prevent the chain dropping. But, assuming its possible for your bike, if you have a cheap crankset, you'll likely need to buy a new one which is compatible with your BB, or possibly new rings depending on what crankset you're running. If you feel your gearing isn't high enough, you're usually better off tweaking the cassette/freewheel (i.e. the gears in the back), or more likely increasing your cadence (with a 42 x 11 at an 80 rpm cadence, which is reasonable, you should be doing around 25 mph. 42 x 14 at the same cadence would be ~20 mph). It is almost surely the case that your cadence is too low. If you are indeed hitting a good cadence, you probably should replace the whole bike so you get something which puts you in a more aerodynamic position and has better gearing (something like a road race bike). 

Depends on which U-lock it is. Something like the Kryptonite Keeper might be hacksaw-able efficiently, but you're going to have to do a lot more work with a hacksaw to take out something like the Fahgettiboutit. Note that you'll need a blade which can cut steel. Bolt cutters may also work on some U-locks. And angle grinders. Theres also using a locksmith. 

The replacement of the 9 speed Shimano road RD with a 9 speed Shimano mountain RD is fine -- the cable pulls are the same. You'll need to re-size (i.e. put on a longer) chain for the bigger cassette though. As for the crankset swap, I think with the new cassette it isn't going to be necessary. In any case, the Sora FD-3403 (which is what you likely have) has a maximum front chainring difference of 20 teeth whereas you're asking for a difference of 22 teeth, so you're technically out of spec. Since its 2 teeth, you might be able to get by, but you'd have to try it and tune it to see if it works. You do need a Shimano road FD to work with the Sora shifters. 

Not brifters, but you can take your downtube shifters and use retroshift levers to get combined brake and and shifting. Essentially, they bolt a downtube shifter onto the hoods. Pretty cheap and reviews are generally positive. As for fitting more gears, you may be able to get a 7 speed freewheel, but you may better off taking your 6 speed freewheel to the LBS and swapping it one with better spacing between the cogs. Tires in 27" aren't too limited (Conti makes gatorskins in 27 inch, panaracer has some, etc.). But if you need to move to 700C, you need to make sure you can move your brakes down by 4 ish due to the 700c diameter change. The selection of new 27" wheels is more limited though (Sun CR-18, etc.), though can be found. 

Some good guidelines are here, courtesy of Sheldon Brown. Assuming you have the right freehub body for Shimano/SRAM-style cassettes on the FTS-X, you just (probably) need a 4.5mm spacer behind the cassette. 

It depends on how you buy the brake, so you need to check whats coming with what you're buying. Typically, you get the caliper+pads+rotor+mounting hardware and buy the brake lever (which is a V-brake lever most of the time unless its a road brake in which case its a regular short pull lever) separately along with the cables+housing. In some cases though (esp. buying brakes on eBay), people buy just the caliper+pads+mounting hardware and get rotors separately. This example from Nashbar tells you the Avid BB7 Road comes with "Includes 1 post mount (74mm) caliper, 1 rotor (160mm) with bolts, sintered pads, and 74mm post mount to IS mount adapter". The typical hardware (Avid BB7 Road with a G2 rotor) is shown below: 

Given that the Schwinn sidewinder is a Walmart bike, you're best off getting a new bike. We call these BSO's or bike shaped objects. By the time you get a basic suspension fork, you'll be spending more than the bike after installation, whereas you could easily buy a good used entry level front suspension mountain bike (say, a Specialized Hard Rock or Trek 3700 or whatever) for slightly more, which will be way more durable and better quality components. 

What you want for road use is slick tires -- tread and knobs are bad for road use. You have 26" (ISO 559) rims, so you need 26 x (something) tires where (something) is a number in decimal form (e.g. 1.75). Going for smaller tires will lower the bike a bit, and smaller tires have to be run at higher pressure (so you'll get less cushioning). There will also be changes in rolling resistance (You may want to read the whole "Tech Info" column on the right side of the Schwalbe page). As for how small you can go, technically you can mount pretty much any 26x(something in decimal) tire on, but the rim width should ideally be of the right width so the tire doesn't roll off or increase the risk of flats or rim damage. I'd probably look at something with a puncture protection belt, like the Schwalbe Marathon Plus (26 x 2.00 will likely be one of the larger slicks they sell, and you can likely go narrower depending on the rim width). 

Having constant access to the brakes isn't as necessary as it would be in mountain biking (where you're spending a lot of time modulating the brakes; road riding does this very little, primarily to stop, sometimes slow down or clean the rims in anticipation for braking). Of course, you'll pick also depending on the environment -- if you're riding in city traffic, you'll likely ride in a position that you have the best visibility and brake access. Note mountain bikes typically have one position; possibly an additional position via bar ends (unless you have a relatively rare drop bar mountain bike). You'll choose your riding position according to preference or comfort (switch hand positions for comfort) in many cases, which will dictate your brake access. 

That isn't a cross bike. First, make sure the bike fits you. If it doesn't, its not really worth restoring (give it to someone who could use it). It looks to be spec'd with relatively cheap stuff, so I wouldn't sink a lot of money into it. The first thing to check is if the frame has any major cracks or damage. If that is in good condition, check the headset to make sure its working smoothly, that the fork is functional (it probably doesn't work well, but if it bottoms out automatically its relatively useless), the pedals turn smoothly, tires hold air, wheels are true, brakes work (probably will need new pads), shifters work, chain is OK, derailleur not bent. A lot of this will likely require elbow grease and real grease/oil rather than new parts. If the fork is in bad shape, you can likely pick up a rigid fork for not much money, but you need some tools to install it which probably means a trip to the bike shop or local co-op. If you take it to a bike shop and ask the guy to give it a safety check, he should be able to quickly determine what needs to be replaced for a few bucks. As for aesthetics, well, not much you can do there. In all likelihood though, all you're going to need to do is oil the chain, adjust the brakes , adjust the derailleurs, throw on some new brake pads, adjust the cables (some may be broken and need replacement), pump up the tires, adjust the seat and handle bars and you're going to be riding off. 

The distinction between women's specific and regular bikes isn't a hard rule, and you don't need a women's specific bike for a woman. Many women use standard bicycles without any problems, though just like men, they may need to tweak stem length, handlebar height, saddle width and height and position (usually, women's geometry bikes have a combination of this, along with a shorter top tube (and more sloping) and different head tube angle+length and seat tube angle+length - theres also a healthy dose of marketing). The idea is that women have longer legs, shorter torsos and arms for a given height and wider sit bones in general. There are also some men who use women's geometry bicycles, but this is rarer (primarily cause men's bicycles are more common, and better looking). Men using "women's seats" is decently common though. If it fits her well, there aren't any problems. If it doesn't fit her well, look at other bikes (not necessarily women specific). 

Typically the old style patch kits work better than the pre glued ones, but properly applied ones should hold up. Follow the directions in the patch kit to apply it properly. You need rim tape, but not a tire liner (check to see its in good condition). Sheldon Brown says tire liners can cause more flats: $URL$ Check for things on the inside of the tire (or outside) or canvas showing. Those can cause flats, but what is the shape of the damage to the tube? 

You don't have to buy new bottles every time they look scratched -- they're still perfectly functional as water bottles. Depending on cage design, you may find that plastic or carbon fiber cages don't scratch bottles as much (but you have essentially some light paint on a water bottle, and if you rub it enough with any bottle cage it will eventually come off). An adjustable cage (like the Topeak Modula EX) may help as well, since you can have the cage adjusted to the point where it just grips the bottle. If you really care about the aesthetic, you can attach some felt or other non-scratching substance to the parts of the bottle cage where the bottle comes into contact with the cage. This can be done with tape or glue. Alternatively, you can buy a different type of bottle with less scratch-able decals. 

Normally, in freezing weather, this is caused by water freezing (and being helped in its task by grime, e.g. salt and dirt and stuff). My procedure for this is generally: 1) Bring the bike inside or somewhere warm so that any ice/water can melt/evaporate off the bike. The evaporation is key -- if you just let it melt and then re-freeze, its going to cause more of a headache. I normally bring the bike in for the night when I want to deal with this. 2) Remove the brakes, thoroughly clean the bosses and brakes with rubbing alcohol and regrease and reinstall them. The brakes should move freely on the bosses. I find that this helps, but I find that cleaning the bosses and replacing the V-brake itself is sometimes a better option -- its not very expensive, and sometimes the crud works itself into places that you won't be able to clean out. 3) Make sure the cables are in good condition. If your cables are old/grimy/worn, you may need to replace them. Some people suggest lubing the brake cables, but this is against many manufacturer recommendations -- ymmv, if you choose to lubricate them. 4) Adjust the V-brakes the usual way. Not really specific to the problem, but you may as well do it at this point. Fenders may help with preventing grime to get in, but they're a bit of a hindrance if ride in snow since it gives somewhere to pack... As for greases/lubes, note that their viscosity and properties change with temperature, so you may want to take that into consideration (e.g. regular old white lithium grease vs a low temperature one). And there's a good chance you'll be dealing with this multiple times in a given winter. If its not cold, steps 2,3,4 are still good ones to follow for troubleshooting sticky V-brakes. 

The frame design (i.e. the geometry and materials), tires, saddle, handlebars all come into play for a particular rider for comfort. The frame design and riding position also come into play for stability; tourers often have long wheelbases. Also, where you can mount your loads (front rack, back rack, fork, etc.) come into play with stability and handling. Repairability and reliability depends on what you want to do. Some tourers like the Surly Long Haul Trucker have things like spoke holders to hold spokes that you can replace broken spokes and what not. If that's your thing, you should look for bikes with that. Also, wheel sizes depending on where you go (700c vs 26"), brake types (disc vs rim; poorer areas probably will make disc (esp. hydraulic disc) repair harder if anything goes wrong) and drivetrain (can you repair it if necessary or is it something thats not going to fail or whatever). There are secondary concerns as well, such as if you have to ship the bike around or whatever (where S&S couplers or similar may be useful). The canonical example of a touring bike for the road is something like the Trek 520 or Surly Long Haul Trucker. It's comfy and stable when loaded due to the geometry, uses bar end shifters which are basically indestructible (unlike brifters, which can go in 1 crash), uses a reliable drive train and has beefy wheels so they can carry high loads reliably for long distances. The gearing is also chosen so that you have a low enough gear to lug heavy stuff up an incline, for example (lower than most road bikes). You have either rim brakes or mechanical disc brakes, which should be reliable and hopefully serviceable. Most are made from steel.
