There really is no need to use a bench for any of this. The "hanging" part of the back raise can be handled by dead lifts, good mornings, those type of exercise where you raise to an upright position against resistance. The only part of the exercise you describe that isn't worked can be worked satisfactorily simply by laying on your stomach, and raising your chest off of the ground, keeping your legs and hips flat on the floor. Another possibility, although space may be an issue, is to use a Swiss ball for the same motion. Work on balance and stability first, as the ball is more mobile than a bench. 

You are asking about measuring two different metrics. One is power/explosiveness, the other is endurance. Technique is a factor, but really only measurable in the initial phases, which it sounds like you are past that point already. While I have no personal experience with training box jumps, other than as occasional plyometric exercises in the dojangh, I would think that you could treat it much the same as you would your 1 rep maximum on a particular lift. Figure out what your 1 shot, best box jump height is, and scale down from that, and establish your benchmarks. If your 1 shot best is three feet (And I'm making up the numbers), then the next time set it for two feet and establish your endurance. Train for a few months then remeasure both. As far as the progression, I don't know if you could introduce an expected standard, simply because the genetic makeup (Fast twitch vs. slow twitch) is going to vary from individual to individual. I would expect, however, that it's much like anything else, large gains in the beginning with decreasing gains the further along the training scale you get. 

I would look at some of the stretches used for swimming, and while the pectoral muscles play some part in posture, one of the major causes of slouching/rounded shoulders is over development of the front deltoid compared to the rear deltoid. This is extremely common in swimmers, and can often be seen in people that emphasize front muscular development and neglect rear development. Stretches 1 Stretches 2

In general, runners tend to have more slender, leaner looking legs than other athletes. This is because low weight, high repetition exercising such as distance running (pretty much anything other than sprints, so anything above 400 meters, really) does not really lend itself to building bulky muscle, and is in fact counterproductive because of the extra weight. It's the wrong kind of stress in the muscle to produce bulk. I would venture a guess that a lot of the "bulky" runners you see are doing weight training and simply running/walking for fitness, or they are multisport athletes such as triathletes or duathletes. This segment will have bulkier legs because of the bicycling that they are doing, which will cause greater hypertrophy in the calves and upper legs. 

In almost every case, it's better to start out with small increments on a daily basis for fitness and health, rather than one large session with long intervals. If you don't have much running experience, I would advise you to get a dedicated pair of running shoes (Shoes that you only use for running), and look into some kind of a couch to 5k type program. Once you are completed with that program, you can gradually add days until you are running 5-7 days a week. Running is very much a repetition sport, in that it is the day in, day out consistency that will produce the best results. If you can manage 20 minutes a day several days a week, that is going to be better on your body and for your health than a single 1 hour session once a week. 

I think the 5x50 is either a typo, or has a missing element. It should be (as you guess) 5x50, 1 50 of swim, 1 50 of kick, 1 50 of drill and 1 50 of swim. The "Big hip roll" is to make sure that you emphasize the hip roll when you are doing all of this. I would suspect that the missing 50 is probably a 50 of pull (Arms only). And yes, on the second workout, it is 100 each of the segment. 

I would suspect that if you actually broke down his entire diet for a day, you would find that the nutrient and composition ratios are not that different than many athletes that do not have his workload, and that the major difference is just the sheer amount. I'd guess that his ratio is probably somewhere in the 60/20/20 or similar range, and for the most part is also planned out by a nutritionist or at least had nutritional consultation somewhere along the way. Is this unhealthy? To some extent, it's unknown. I would tend to lean on the side of it not being unhealthy, as athletes of Olympic/World caliber have been eating high calorie density foods and amounts for decades to sustain heavy workout loads, and as a cohort, have exhibited no greater tendencies to overeating diseases than any other subsection of the population. Where it will be a factor is if he continues to eat in this fashion after he stops working out quite so much. If he does that, then yes, he will more than likely start to suffer obesity related diseases after the usual time. If he controls his diet and adapts to eating less, then I don't see it being a problem. 

There was a recent study in the Journal of Applied Physiology, where they took a cohort of 96 obese people and started them on different exercise regimens, as well as a targeted 30% deficit in daily calories. They were either slotted into four different programs, as explained on this writeup: 

Ok, as fredob requested, this is an n=1 style of writeup, for my experiences and what I consider to be the core kernels of a lifetime fitness program. Note, this is not a design for specific competition, this is fitness in general. Obviously if you compete, you would need to tweak the physical component and nutrition components to support that. NUTRITION This is the first component, and arguably the most important. You can be running 75 miles a week, throwing around heavy weights, whatever your activity might be, but shoveling big macs and fries down 4 days a week with pizza and ice cream chasers. If you don't supply your body in a healthy way, you can't expect it to perform consistently. Note I say nutrition, and not diet. In my mind, diet implies a process. The problem with a process is that it has a beginning, and an end. There is no end. You either have good nutrition planning or you don't. Doesn't mean that you can't have cheat days, fall of the wagon a bit, etc., but overall your nutrition plan is sound and based in your needs for daily existence plus your activity. MENTAL ACTIVITY This is the second component. Protect your mind. Play games, play an instrument, read a book, do puzzles, whatever floats your boat. Keeping your mind active and well rounded will enable you to still be sharp and on top of things well into your twilight years. The more active you can be, the better. PHYSICAL ACTIVITY Get out. Do SOMETHING. Walk, ride a bike, swim, play horseshoes, move around, anything. Get your heart rate up, sweat a little, make your body work. Find something you truly enjoy doing, because like a diet, "getting in shape" or doing something you don't like for the sake of activity is a dead end process. Ok, so you got in shape. Now what? But, if you truly enjoy what you're doing, you'll keep on doing it. RESISTANCE TRAINING More and more, studies are showing that resistance training can help preserve muscle as we age. Take a look at what you do in your physical activity, and plan your resistance training to supplement that, and keep your muscles in balance. A lot of back problems, for instance, could be alleviated if people trained their spinal muscles as much as their trophy abs. You don't necessarily have to heave around small cars, but especially as you age, resistance training can help preserve muscle. BALANCE Keep your life in balance. Make time for your sports, family, work, personal time, etc. When you start sacrificing one for the other, your life eventually starts spinning out of control. There will be times when you HAVE to sacrifice for a bit, but let those be as short as possible. Now, I have been in sports for 41 years. This includes 17 years swimming, 9 years cross country (HS/College), 2 years wrestling, 4 years competitive cycling, almost 20 years in martial arts. I've competed at every level from local clubs to a handful of Nationals and a couple of Worlds. As soon as something stops being fun, I find something else. (I walked out on two years of scholarship in swimming because I was burned out. Still hate swimming.) I play D&D, board games, poker, chess. I have an outstanding wife and wonderful family. I recognize my capabilities, and I'm still not sure if I've found my limits or not. In those 41 years, I've had one injury (Ruptured achilles 6 weeks ago) that kept me sidelined for more than a week. I attribute this to a lifetime of athletics, lucky genetics, and enough sense to monitor myself and sensibly push my limits, and staying within the above categories. Hope this is what you were looking for. 

Yes, I think that if you can run a 1/2 marathon, you should be able to at least complete a marathon. The method that I am going to suggest is called the Galloway Run/Walk program. There is a good PDF article here, that has a chart for pacing and how much to run or walk by pace. Make sure to read/note this paragraph: 

We were anywhere in the range of 50-75 mile weeks, and in college, that was bumped up to 75-100 mile weeks depending on where we were in the season. One thing that has been critical over the years is base. Base is the king of all, if you have a solid base behind you then it is fairly easy to maintain on a lower amount of running. So yes, if you have a good base, I would think that it would be fairly easy for you to maintain your current level on a limited amount of running. If you want to improve, you may need to up your daily mileage. As a coach I know says, "Just run. Run lots. Mostly slow, sometimes fast." The biggest thing I've seen with runners is they simply go too hard all the time.
