Can Fascism be derived from first principles? Satya Devi speculated that this was possible. I can define Fascism per the Oxford Encyclopedia. 

Postmodernism is a response to modernism with less optimism about human progress. Both modernism and postmodernism hold that the previous philosophies are obsolete, and they rebel against classical culture through abstract and postmodern art. The difference is that modernism is optimistic about humans' ability to achieve progress while postmodernists hold all value as relative and do not necessarily believe in progress. 

Yes. This is the core of the currently accepted paradigm in cosmology: Conformal Cyclical Cosmology, or CCC. $URL$ The anthropic principle is, in fact, meaningless without the assumption that an observer must always exist. This is proven axiomatically in CCC. CCC also has empirical predictions, which have been confirmed, but those are just in addition to its formal proof. The mathematics behind the proof are too lengthy to post here. However, CCC can be understood simply as the idea that the universe must always exist and contain information, except at the instant before and after heat death, when the universe's information content approaches that of a singularity and the cycle restarts. Only the portions of time containing life will be observed, per the anthropic principle, they will repeat endlessly. This seems to have been taken as self evident by premodern civilizations, while the formal proof of it is fairly recent (2007). 

Unless we think that the "if" here has some kind of mathematical or logical foundational interpretation, this following isn't a logical guarantee - indeed, as has been pointed out in the literature around Truth, Modus Ponens seems to struggle as a law if we think that "If" means material implication and where Truth is taken to be considered in terms of the rules that you can deduce that the sentence 'P' is true whenever P is the case and vice versa. Yet it seems to capture the very point of what it means to say "if" in casual discussion - we want the conclusion to "follow from" the premise in an authoritative mode of assertion. What we are looking for is some notion of the idea of a Logical Consequence relation suited for argument and reasoning. Picking apart the foundations of Argumentation in some kind of methodical, logical framework that can function as a public standard requires certain modelling assumptions about what each of the supposedly logical terms we appeal to are taken to mean. Alfred Tarski, in his 1983 paper "On the Concept of Logical Consequence" (sorry, I can't find an online version!), discusses how we pick out certain words or fragments of language as logical constants to represent functions in our semantics, which enables us to form and apply a mathematical model for how we do in fact reason using mathematical structurings of the world. Other analytical philosophers have tried to do something similar by using tools in proof theory to represent how we transform statements or propositions in more combinatorial ways. This was a pretty live debate even fairly recently, though I'm not sure if any definitive consensus has been reached as to whether the consequence work has any useful philosophical applications. One major challenge for this field has been to address Curry's Paradox, which, much like Godel's argument, seems to render a complete capture of a relation of consequence of a particular logical system inaccessible to that same logical system. 

A crime comprises 2 elements: 3. Actus reus, 4. Mens rea. I understand that 2 is separate from 3; whether or not the defendant deserves leniency, changes not the defendant's actions. I also understand that 1 and 2 reference separate stages of the Criminal Trial: 1 the Judgement, and 2 the Sentencing after the defendant has been convicted. But is not it possible that 2 can affect and connect with 1? If 4 is absent, then a jury may treat the defendant with leniency by deciding to find the defendant NOT GUILTY (innocent)? Then the defendant would not be convicted? 

I agree with the solution’s paraphrases (1.1 and 3.1), but I disagree with 4. To me, the missing premise should instead be 5 as follows: 5. Since women have as much right to self-esteem as men, women should earn as money as men. 6. So is 4 wrong? 7. Rather than ‘essential part’, should 4 be stated as a Necessary Condition or Sufficient Condition? 

It's a matter of amount and quality of conscious experience. The simulation may have some degree of sentience, but it may be many orders of magnitude lower than what humans are able to achieve. Fundamentally, any claim about consciousness is untestable, and it is a moot point. But it is theoretically possible to imitate human qualia so exactly in a computer that an outside observer cannot tell the difference. The example you gave is just a very minor step in this direction. 

The anthropic principle states that universes must be observed to be compatible with the sapient life that observes it. Thus, only universes containing sapient life will be observed. Is this equivalent to the theory of immortality? 

Is there a reason why death could be final? Is there some law that prevents something from ever existing again after it is dead? Why are there supposedly entities that are able to cease existing and never exist again?

I understand the first paragraph (on the general distinction between FC and HG), but I do not comprehend how 2 is a class statement. To me, 2 can be equally interpreted correctly as 3 below. I accept that 2 is likelier than 3, because 2 asserts a decrease in the mean average of fuel consumption, whereas 3 asserts a decrease in each vehicle's fuel consumption but 3 is certainly possible (For example, if suddenly a law were enacted that allowed only electric cars).

This has a certain explanatory power, which is tied to the relationship between what it means to bake a cake and the causal role that mixing wet ingredients together plays in that intended action. 

I'm going to do the typical Analytical thing and say that yes of course Western Philosophy is "Inherently" Patriarchal and Mono-racial, given its history, and I think given the massive slew recently of sexual harassment cases involving philosophy professors that this is substantially still the case today. But does that mean the same thing as the claim that Western Philosophy is "Essentially" or "Necessarily" Patriarchal and Mono-racial? (suspending for the moment metaphysical worries about essences or possibilities) I think that we can still accommodate change in this without writing off the whole project as doomed to be the exercise of power by hegemonic authority. One example at least of signs of a sea change is in the role of feminism in challenging typical foundational assumptions in the epistemology of science (SEP article on the topic). In classical scientific epistemology we have often taken the abstract Scientist to be in a position of being able to make value-independent judgements of what is perceived to be "the evidence". But of course this abstraction depends quite a lot on certain presumptions of what it means to include and exclude as value-dependent judgement, and given the typical demography of science in the classical world and the clear need to remove our ideal scientist from being a generalization just over white upper class straight men and their values, there is a definite project in mining out our modelling assumptions to work out whether these still stand outwith the privileged perspective of the old guard. I also definitely think there is room in other areas of philosophy for challenging along the same lines. Because yes, philosophical debate can be confrontational in a way that is often weighted towards those who've been in comfortable seats of authority, but this also means that at least some poor philosophy is being covered up with bluster and entitlement. And the results of the revelation here can be really exciting to watch - check out this awesome review by Kerry McKenzie of Colin McGinn's work in Metaphysics. 

Truth and falsity must be distinguished from credibility, as AAH does not affects the former but affects the latter. AAH affects credibility. Credibility may affect our evaluation of the premises.

What exactly are the IFs? Which if-clause(s) does Nagel reference? How is 1 true? How do the If-clauses differ from ? 

Assume objective quality: how's the emboldened sentence true? I ask not about subjective quality that's answered in the next sentence. 

Some further thinking Of course, you may find that this analysis of your concept lacks some of the force and utility of the concepts of evenness it extends. For instance, in the integer case, either an integer is even or it is not, and if it is not, we say that it is an odd integer. In your new rational case, however, while it is true that either a rational is even or it isn't, it doesn't seem natural to say that if it isn't it's odd. Why not? Because then the odd numbers would consist of all of the numbers whose last digits are odd, and also all of the numbers that don't have last digits. So, say, () would be odd on this suggestion. Why should rational odd be the property that gets all of the non-terminating ones - why wasn't rational even covering these instead? This throws up questions about whether our analysis of rational evens has missed something out. Now maybe you might like to do some development work and add further refinements of your concept of even numbers. So let's say we add a "stability" qualifier to our definition of even numbers, such that in addition to the numbers we have above (where we have a last digit), we also add another disjoint condition:
