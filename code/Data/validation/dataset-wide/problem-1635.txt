Sugar will help microorganism growth, and ethanol is the product of microorganism growth in a process called fermentation [1] (regardless of intentional or unintentional). Honey is essentially sugar, mostly glucose and fructose, that makes about 85 percent of the solids in honey [2]. Saturated sugar [however] inhibits the growth of yeast and other fungal spores [3]. This property, known as hygroscopic, describes that sugar contain very little water in its natural state but it can easily absorb moisture from its surrounding [4][5]. 

There is no mention of "rust" found in the text of publication, which would disagree with the claim that "rusty nail wounds cause tetanus". Regardless of minor or major wounds, contamination leads to a successful infection. 

Red mercury does indeed exist, mercury (11) oxide (HgO) varies from yellow to red, here. The more fine the particles the more towards the yellow it is, the bigger the lumps, the more red. There is the neat trick that if you heat it in a low oxygen environment (say one in which there is charcoal to snap up the O2), it decomposes to mercury and oxygen (2HgO => 2Hg + O2). 

I can find no suggestion (or study) that a particular food reduces fertility. However, there is a suggestion here certain tropical foods can cause spontaneous abortion. (Miscarriage) There are similar claims elsewhere, but again, no studies to confirm or deny a causal connection. Some ancient methods of birth control are listed here, but again, no study to support their effect, though many are known to be generally poisonous, and we can expect they wouldn't do any prospective baby much good, nor the mother. 

Therefore, the quoted publications in question and answer (or under "existing claim") are most likely unbiased and plausible based on the supporting explanation above. Summary Honey would contain very little amount of alcohol, or specifically ethanol, because of fermentation caused by sugar-tolerant yeast found in honey.

If you finish the article here, it emphasizes that more research is needed, ie. a strong causal connection can not yet be made between a particular diet and the onset of Prostate Cancer. With regards infertility, here it is suggested avoiding fads such as ginseng, kelp, oysters, garlic and champaigne, which have a folk-tail connection to increased fertility, and just follow a balanced diet: 

An high-fat diet must also be taken into account. Here is a comprehensive breakdown of what types of fat there are, what it does to help you (obtain fat soluble vitamins such as Vitamin A, provide energy.) and harm you. (As in heart disease, narrowing of arteries because of fatty deposits such as cholesterol.) This is true not just for those who are obese, though both high fat diet and obesity are risk factors for cause heart disease and vascular problems. Obesity on it's own but with a favorable diet - ie. a balanced one, but eaten in excess quantity - is known to cause heart disease, type ll diabetes, increased risk of certain cancers, heart attack and stroke. See here. Prostate cancer seems to have flimsy evidence to support the idea that a high fat and low fruit diet may add to susceptibility: 

Despite the hygroscopic environment, it is said that honey should still contain yeasts [2]. In fact, honey is found to be a good environment for certain kind of yeasts to live. The presence of the yeasts can be explored in this book, Biodiversity and Ecophysiology of Yeasts [6], as quoted below. 

Tetanus treatment and prevention While Tetanus is a preventable disease [4][5], a person who has been infected should be treated immediately with human tetanus immune globulin (TIG) (or equine antitoxin) [6][7]. 

HowStuffWorks has explained further on the exposure of the bacteria to the people. Neither people in farms and cities are completely safe, according to its article [3], notably page 2 as quoted below. 

Bear in mind that the rest of the body is usually clothed which provides the most important insulation of the body, as can be seen in a thermal scan image: thermal imaging system screening passengers for H1N1 flu $URL$ [Scale is heat loss from least (bottom, blue) to most (top, red/white); source: Britannica.com] However, this image also shows that hair is actually a pretty good insulator as well. So while a clothed human indeed loses much of their heat through the head, donning a hat won’t help. There is another aspect: the body will strive to keep the core body temperature constant. If necessary, it does this by down-regulating blood circulation (and consequently heat exchange) in the periphery (arms, legs); in contrast, the blood circulation through the head (in particular, the brain) stays almost constant: Body core temperature $URL$ In fact, next to the trunk (clothed!) the head emits the most amount of heat per area (skin temperature of 34.6°C) [source: Blatteis, Physiology and pathophysiology of temperature regulation, p. 17], and also the most total energy of any non-clothed area [ibd.]. So yes, when clothed (and not immersed in water; this diminishes the insulating effect of clothing significantly!) we do indeed lose most of our body heat through our head. However, except for bald people, hats may not help that much (to maintain the core body temperature). 

One should have received Tetanus vaccine when one was younger than 7 years of age. A booster dose may be given to adults, but the amount of dose varies by whether the adult was unvaccinated or after an exposure to the infection under some circumstances [8].

Auto-immune conditions such as pernicious anemia can cause B12 deficiency, which in turn causes lethargy and tiredness. Here. Also, in people in good health otherwise, those who take acid supressors for 2 years or more stand a chance of developing B12 deficiency. Here. Currently no particular vitamin is associated with Ginkgo Biloba, but as has been noted above, Ginkgo Biloba may produce some measurable benefits in some subsets of people tested, but are not considered generally successful.: Here. (same reference as Guru42's answer, just read a little more of the article and you'll see it's benefits are not considered of great significance.) I am unable to find any reputable article which demonstrates that vitamin supplements are of any benefit to the memory of (ie. enhance the memory of) people who otherwise lie within the normal range of health. 

(The numbers differ slightly from those in Avi’s answer since I’m using the “42%” number from the question to calculate abortions but the principle doesn’t change.) 

Now, the Friendly Atheist articles are generally well researched and thus believable, but this one is less so. For one thing, most of its references are to entirely unspecific (or not accessible) “Google Books” searches that prove nothing. Furthermore, the claim that there are no legitimate records is directly contradicted by the Wikipedia article above, which cites several references by contemporaries, such as Tacitus and Tertullian. Another article claims that the persecution lasted three centuries and was witnessed by several historians. All this directly contradicts the claim that “there are zero authentic accounts … until over a century after Christianity became the official religion of the Roman Empire”, because that happened after the three centuries of persecution. It also contradicts a quote taken from The Myth of Persecution: How Early Christians Invented a Story of Martyrdom (by Candida Moss, published in 2013): 

Some people would be correct to observe that good nutrition in general will prevent memory loss. There are particular circumstances, such as in alcoholism, where the person can benefit from strong B vitamin and especially B1 can improve memory: Here. 

Here. This can then be re-oxidized. Rinse and repeat. That's magic. However, if you read to the bottom of the "Reactivity Profile" et al. in the above link, you will see it's quite dangerous to play with and highly toxic. It can decompose spontaneously (explosively) under sunlight and/or friction. - It's conceivable that this was viewed as magical too. As I am unable to prove the existence of a special property of any mercury compounds or amalgams regarding nuclear weapons, I would posit that red mercury may have been spoken of or written about because it was covering for or being used as a synonym for something magical during WW2 - in technical terms, Germany and the rest of the industrialized world were trying to solve the supercriticality problem (creating a nuclear fission event on a large scale, ie. a bomb.) with the uranium, in simple terms they needed to create High Explosives, and ways of detonating them, to smash the uranium pieces together really hard or to compress a sphere of the material by surrounding it with the H.E. and detonating it as quickly as possible. Thus the code words Red Mercury might have come about as a "magical bullet" that wins the war. This is an unproven hypothesis though, it would need a reference from a consensus of historians of repute, there doesn't yet appear to be one. This is not to be confused with mercury fulminate, another explosive discovered in the 1830s, used to prime ammunition - this may well have been the chemical end-product that the terrorists were after in the article cited by the OP, here.
