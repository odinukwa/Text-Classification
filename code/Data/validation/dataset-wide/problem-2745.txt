Some bad treatments are worse than killing. By bad treatment you are allowing the victim to suffer pain for a (comparatively) long period. In case of bad treatment, you can apologize to the victim. Or if it is a creature, you can do remedies for that. But this cannot be done in the case of killing. One 'can' treat another badly many times. But killing; one can do it once only. [I think this would be enough for this question] 

If a person don't know himself we cannot say he is wise in all aspects. Philosophy, 'love of wisdom', if it needs to last not only for a long time, but for ever, the philosopher's philosophy must come from the root. That means, the truth ... and it must influence the protection of Dharma also. Many Philosophies can be treated as thoughts only, if etymological meaning (of Philosophy) is given great importance. A Philosophy if it is not related to Dharma OR Truth, it would be better to treat it as a mere thought. 

When there is a possibility of certainty we need not depend on probability. That is not a good logic. So, there is not much complication as almost all of us think. According to the question the tourist will get a maximum of 2 Yes-answers or 2 No-answers to a Yes-question. So, if he got 2 such answers from first two questions he can ask the third question to one of the first two men again. If the three men don't know one another, the tourist doesn't need to ask anything to the third man in two cases. He can identify all men by the third question. But third question must always be an unpredictable Ye/No question. E.g.: "Will I get a drink from you after some time?" Since this is an unpredictable question X and Y won't say "Yes/No"; but Z will. So, the first two questions may be the same (The right answer must always be "Yes"): "Is today a Sunday?" (If it was a Sunday) The third question: "Will I get a drink from you after some time?" The responses are given as a table below. Here in the first two cases in the following table, the third question is again to the 1st Man. But in the other 4 cases, the third question is to the 3rd Man. Here I didn't ask anything to the 3rd Man if he got 2 Yes-answers or 2 No-answers. (See cases 1 & 2) I have mentioned the order of the men who were identified as (decision 1)-- D1, D2 & D3. [i.e, D1 was identified first, D2 second and D3 third.] Except in Cases 1&2 D2 & D3 are interchangeable [i.e., the 3rd decision can be taken as the 2nd decision. Answers will not change.]. 

We all know the children of the same parents need not necessarily be of the same opinion. Even twins differ in their tastes and abilities. Since the philosophers you meant are the product of different areas, times, etc, their life experiences would be different and so their perspective about life would also have difference. We, the decision makers, should also be included in the above category. Also, since it is about life we cannot quantify them and decide which one is absolutely rational. This is happening in the case of most philosophers. But in the case of men who reached the topmost level, since they know each other, they have explained the same thing in different ways. We will also be able to know this when we reach that level. 

The flight of 'veterans' may be because of many reasons. Different causes for escape (mentioned in the first para): Some people when they feel that they had only loss in their life than profit, they won't like to continue in their religion. When the religious scholars can't answer the followers' some sensible or 'disturbing' questions against dogmas, they will certainly lose hope in them and eventually in their religion also. When some people who have good questioning-ability (sometimes) can't cheat their conscience. They can't negotiate with their religion. When some people feel that there is no scientific basis to some dogmas, they try to escape from their religion. When there is big gap between the actions and words of priests or when they can't find any good role models, some people feel fed-up and try to quit religion. Sometimes when people know that the 'services' of their religions are only as a part of some flourishing business, they lose hope in that religion. Some people like some dogmas only, but they are not allowed to choose according to their wish. [I mean, the dogmas are not follower-friendly.] Followers are not allowed to choose some useful/sensible/harmless dogmas in other religions. Some people can't find different dogmas in their religion according to their caliber/nature. Some people practise their rituals without trying to understand the essence of their religion. People who are in extreme poverty can't lend their ears to dogmas. 

Here the (Final) conclusion is this: [See the first two tables also] He who says "Not sure", is Mr X. [Reason: Since Mr Z's response is "Not sure"] He who keeps mum, is Mr Y. [Reason: To avoid saying the truth] He who says "Yes/No", is Mr Z. [Reason: He always says Yes/No] 

N.B: $ The person who the first question was asked in each case. You can find out the answer using a 'No-question' instead of my 'Yes-question'(Is today a Sunday?). But the order of Men given in the table above will change. 

This boring is seen in almost all people; but with unfulfilled / suppressed desires. This boring may be because of many reasons. When one gets a healthy body their boring will disappear. Similarly, when one lives in a completely pleasant environment or when one gets interesting things, good friends, good partners etc. this boring will disappear. Almost all people go behind material things like these. [Read about Smasana-vairagya] Such persons are not raised to the highest state... or they can't be considered as persons who knew about their former life. In other words, the enlightened realizes that he (the soul) was present (never absent) before he got his present body. This happens only when their entire personalities have been purified by strict moral discipline. {"Certainly never at any time did I not exist, nor you, nor all these kings and certainly never shall we cease to exist in the future"--says the Bhagavad Gita (Chapter 2 Verse 12)} Were 'persons' like Sankara, Sri Ramakrishna, Vivekanada, Ramana Maharshi realized themselves after a luxurious life...? You can give many exceptions. But how can we generalize that this exceptions are true? How did their relinquishment happen before 'tasting' their life to its maximum level? How could they teach the same ancient ideas (The Eternal Truth) the Upanishads declared, without any impression of their past life...? This shows their lives had continuity. Loss of memories happens to everybody/every body always. Since it is common to all, they should be ignored while dealing reincarnation. If this title--'reincarnated' is given only to selected persons, isn't it regaining memory? :) ... if you can direct your thought to that direction...? (I have already declared my opinion in the first line.) So, Reincarnation is not a matter/product of amnesia.
