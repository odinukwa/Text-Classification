A nice Lemma due to Konyagin asserts that for any subset $B \subset \mathbb{F}_p$ holds $$ |B.B - B.B + B.B - B.B + B.B - B.B| \geq \frac{1}{2}\min\{p, |B|^2 \}, $$ where the standard notation for the product set $B.B$ is used. Now suppose that instead of $B.B$ we have a partial productset $B\stackrel{G}{.}B$ along the edges of a graph $G$ of edge density $\epsilon$ (meaning that $b_1b_2 \in B\stackrel{G}{.}B$ if only if $b_1, b_2 \in B$ are adjacent in $G$). Is it true that if $B < \sqrt{p}$ a similar estimate $$ |B\stackrel{G}{.}B + B\stackrel{G}{.}B + B\stackrel{G}{.}B - B\stackrel{G}{.}B - B\stackrel{G}{.}B - B\stackrel{G}{.}B| \gg_{\epsilon} |B|^2 $$ holds? UPD Sorry for sloppy notation. So what it means. $B.B = \{b_ib_j |b_i, b_j \in B \}$, $B.B-B.B = \{b_ib_j - b_kb_l |b_i, b_j, b_k, b_k \in B\}$, and $B.B+B.B$ etc. being defined the same way. 

A classical theorem of Cassels states that if a homogenous quadratic form $Q$ has an integer zero, then there is a zero of small height (bounded solely by the coefficients and number of variables). Birch and Davenport extended this result to an arbitrary lattice $\Lambda$. Now suppose there is an integer lattice $\Lambda$ in $\mathbb{R}^{kl}$ and it is known that there is a vector $v \in \Lambda$ of the form $$ v =(\lambda_1 w, \lambda_2 w, \ldots, \lambda_kw), $$ where $\lambda_i$ are integers and $w$ is an integer vector in $\mathbb{R}^l$. Of course, such a condition is equivalent to multiple quadratic relations $X_iX_j - X_kX_l = 0$. I am wondering if one can then guarantee the existence of such $v$ with bounded height (polynomial in $\det(\Lambda))$)? It seems that in general there are no meaningful generalisations of Cassels' theorem to simultaneous quadratic forms. 

Back to 1980, P.Erd\H{o}s and C. Pomerance asked in their paper "Matching the natural numbers up to n with distinct multiples in another interval" (see page 160 of the journal scan $URL$ "Related to these questions, we ask if there is a large constant $c$ so that in any interval of length $cn$ there are $\pi(n)-\pi(n/2)$ distinct multiples of the primes in $(n/2, n]$ (there need not be a matching). " I am wondering if there is any progress on this question. Also, can we say anything if we require only some prime multiples to be present (e. g. we want to guarantee that there are distinct multiples of at least $O(n/\log n)$ primes from $(n/2, n]$)? 

Let $M_i$ be fixed rectangular matrices with integer coefficients less than $n$. Consider the variety defined by the condition $$ \mathrm{rank}(\lambda_1M_1 + \lambda_2M_2 + ... + \lambda_kM_k) = 1. $$ Assume that there is an integral point $(\lambda_1, ..., \lambda_k)$ lying on this variety, can we then guarantee that there is an integral point with the height (maximal absolute value of the coordinates) bounded polynomially in $n$ (the exponent may depend on $k$ and the size of the matrices)? P. S. It might be related to the Birch-Davenport theorem, so with high probability this question is either known or out of reach for current methods (which would be ok to know), but I couldn't find a reference. 

If you divide on $a$ and let $a$ to be big you have basically a set of linear inequalities of the form $1-o(1) \geq b_ic-d_i \geq o(1)$. If you look at $b_ic$ geometrically, it is a beam of lines emanating from zero with slopes $b_1, ..., b_{a-1}$. And you want to find a point $c$ such that the line $x = c$ intersects each line in a strip $1+d_i-o(1) \geq y \geq d_i+o(1)$. It seems that if you order the lines according to the slope and starting from the line with the smallest slope (smallest $b_i$) it is possible to choose $d_i$ for each new line appropriately (based on the geometric representation above) 

Recall that a graph is called $k$-chordal if any cycle $C$ of length $> k$ contains a chord, i.e. an edge joining to non-consecutive vertices in $C$. Let $f(n, k)$ be the minimal number of edges s.t. any graph on $n$ vertices can be made $k$-chordal by deleting at most $f(n, k)$ edges. There is a paper of Erd\H{o}s and Laskar "On maxinal chordal subgraph" where they show that $$ f(n,3) = \frac{n^2}{2} - (1+o(1))\sqrt{2}n^{3/2}. $$ I am wondering if other bounds for $f(n, k)$ are known for bigger $k$. A bound in terms of the number of edges is also of interest. In particular, is is true that there is some bounded $k$ s.t. $$ f(n, k) = o(|E|), $$ where $E$ is the number of edges? UPD The answer for the last question is NO, as seen from the following example. Take $k+1$ copies of $K_{n/(k+1)}$, call it $G_0, ..., G_k$. Join all vertices in $G_i$ and $G_{i+1}$ (addition mod $(k+1)$). One can show that for this graph $f(n, k) \geq n^2/4(k+1)^2$. It is interesting to see what is the right constant, though. 

It is well known that for a given polynomial $f \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ the number of primes $p$ s.t. $f$ has a root modulo $p$ is infinite. In fact, one can even write down a formula for the density of such primes (e.g. D. Berend, Y. Bilu "Polynomials with roots modulo every integer"). Now suppose that $f = \sum_{i=0}^d a_ix^i$ is irreducible, the degree $d$ is fixed and all $a_i \leq N^C$ for some constant $C$. Is it possible to prove the uniform bound (e.g. whith the constant depending only on $d$ and $C$ and $N$ large) $$ \pi(N, f) = \Omega_{d, C}(\frac{N}{\log N}), $$ where $\pi(N, f)$ means the number of primes less than $N$ s.t. $f$ has a root modulo $p$? The aforementioned paper cites a general density formula due to Lagarias and Odlyzko which seem to provide such a bound assuming GRH. It's of course highly desirable to drop this assumption. 

Due to the supporting hyperplane theorem, a convex set $C$ in a separable topological space has supporting hyperplance at each of its boundary points. The theorem only guarantees its existence, now I want to discuss the uniqueness of the supporting hyperplane. A special situation where uniqueness holds is when the supporting hyperplane at $p\in\partial C$ coincides with the tangent pf $\partial C$ at $p$. For example, when the $\partial C$ is piecewise linear, then the supporting hyperplanes must coincide with tangent planes except at vertices of $C$. There are sufficient conditions, say $C$ being strictly convex, which guarantees the uniqueness of the supporting hyperplane. But strict convexity does not lead to the conclusion that the supporting hyperplane coincide with tangents. Moreover. since the supporting hyperplane theorem is no more than Hahn-Banach theorem, I was wondering

Given a convex cone $P\subset X$ where $X$ is a $K$-vector space, $K=\mathbb{R}\text{ or }\mathbb{C}$ is a field. Suppose that $P$ satisfies positive element stipulations. (1) $X=P-P$. (2) $P\cap-P=\{0\}$. Then we can define a partial ordering on $X$ by defining $x\geq_P y\Leftrightarrow x-y\in P$ for $\forall x,y\in X$. Now we construct a norm $\left\Vert \cdot\right\Vert$ on this space $X$, if the closure w.r.t. norm induced topology $P\subsetneqq\bar{P}\subset X$ also satisfies positive element stipulations, is there an example that $\left(X,\geq_{P}\right)$ and $\left(X,\geq_{\bar{P}}\right)$ are both vector lattices? 

There is few posts on MO that asked about reference on this topic, and I found some difficulty during the process of getting myself into the subject so here is the question. I really want to hear from someone who is familiar with this wonderful field of random matrices. 1 I would like to know a self-study material on the subject of random matrix theory, which should be more advanced than [Tao]. I did read into [Tao]'s "Related article" part but found it focus on dynamics instead of a general interest like the content of [Mehta] covered. 2 About the classic in the field [Mehta], I am confused about its editions since some probabilist said the 2nd edition is better than the third one while 3rd edition is almost 200 pages of more than the 2nd edition. Since I have not started to read it yet, I would like to know which edition of [Mehta] is better to start (as a newcomer to the subject) with, and what is the difference between these two editions(besides those newly added references Mehta mentioned in the 3rd edition's preface, which is not very informative to me...)? 3 Maybe this should be another post, but how much (statistical) mechanics should I know if I want to read [Deift&Gioev] in order to understand it better? Since my basic interest is in the mathematical side, is there any good-and-short introductory paper providing an overview about the subject of statistical mechanics? 4 Lastly, I would really like to know if there is some must-read or introductory paper on the subject of random matrices. (Besides [Tao].) And a roadmap of learning this subject, if possible, will be greatly appreciated. Reference [Mehta]Mehta, Madan Lal. Random matrices. Vol. 142. Academic press, 2004.

For two $n \times n$ nonnegative definite Hermitian matrices $A$ and $B$ over the real number field $\mathbb R$: 

I figured it out by looking at the last few chapters in [Shiryayev] and some thoughts. The problem can be considered in following way with the aid of a formalized definition of conditional expectation. Without loss of generality we assumed the sample random variable $X$ from the model $\cal{P}$ to be $L^1(P),\forall P\in \cal{P}$. This is easily verified to be true for any $P$ dominated by a $\sigma$-finite measure $\mu$ on the probability space $(\Omega,\mathcal{F},P)$. Also we discuss the situation where $X,T\geq 0,\forall\omega\in\Omega $. Here $$X:\Omega\rightarrow\mathbb{R},\omega\mapsto X(\omega)$$ and $$T:\Omega\rightarrow\mathbb{R},\omega\mapsto T(X(\omega))$$ are random variables. $X$ is the sample random variable; $T$ is the sufficient statistics/random variable. Invoke Radon-Nikodym Theorem on the measure defined by $\nu(G):=\int_{G}XdP$ on subspace $(\Omega,\sigma(T),P)$ where $\sigma(T)\subset\cal{F}$ is the $\sigma$-field generated by sufficient statistic $T$, then the R-N derivative $\frac{d\nu}{d\mu}$ is the conditional expectation (random variable) $\boldsymbol{E}(X\mid T)(\omega)$. This can be directly checked: $$\int_{G}\boldsymbol{E}(X\mid T)(\omega)d\mu(\omega)$$ $$=\int_{G}\frac{d\nu}{d\mu}d\mu(\omega)=\int_{G}d\nu(\omega)=\nu(G)$$ for any $G\in \sigma(T)$. With this definition, we can directly assert that a conditional expectation is a simple random variable if $A_n$ is a partition of $\Omega$, i.e. $\cup_n A_n=\Omega,A_n\in \sigma(T)$ such that (since we want $1_{A_n}$ to be $\sigma(T)$-measurable functions.) $$\boldsymbol{E}(X\mid T)(\omega)=\frac{\nu(A_n)}{P(A_n)}1_{A_n}(\omega)$$ We know that if a sufficient statistics $T$ for model $\mathcal{P}=\{P\}$ , then from the expression above, the partition $\{A_n\}$ will satisfy that $\frac{\nu(A_n)}{P(A_n)}=\frac{\int_{A_n}XdP}{P(A_n)}=\frac{\int_{A_n}XdP}{\int_{A_n}1dP}$ is independent of the choice of $P\in\cal{P}$. The level sets of $T$ form a partition as well as generating class(not necessarily atoms) of $\sigma(T)$. So a sufficient statistic will have its level sets partition the $\Omega$ in such a way that the conditional expectation is a constant random variable on each partition component independent of the choice of $P$. In other words, $T$ is a "piece-wise" constant set function, being constant on those sets $A_n\in\cal{F}$ such that $P\{X\in A_n\}\equiv C_n\in\mathbb{R},\forall P\in\cal{P}$ The minimal sufficient statistics $U=\phi(T)$ for some measurable function $\phi$ because $\sigma (U)$ is the coarest partition possible satisfying above requirements. i.e. $\sigma(U)\subset\sigma(T)$ so $U$ must be $\sigma(T)$-measurable, and the relation $U=\phi(T)$ follows from the fact that any $\sigma(T)$-measurable random variable $U$ can be written as $\phi(T)$ for some Borel function $\phi$. A direct consequence is: there exists a Borel-measurable function $\phi$, $\boldsymbol{E}(U\mid T)=\phi(T)$
