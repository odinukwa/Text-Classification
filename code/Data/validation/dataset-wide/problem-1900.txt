First, the intern likely is unaware that such things are problematic. You should first sit him down and explain that you see this charge and why it might be a problem and get his side of the story. Since you saw this from the credit card company, it is possible someone else had the charge or he did not know he was not supposed to use it for such purposes (if indeed that is the case in your company.) He might not even know he should check with you concerning any expenses over a certain limit before he makes them. (I personally wouldn't let an intern have a company charge card unless they had to travel.) Now you will need to tell your boss about this because the charge will need to be paid. You will likely have to tell him that you are at fault because you didn't make the guidelines clear enough for the intern. You also need to plan who will pay it if the boss doesn't approve it as seems likely from what you wrote. Given this is an intern who likely did not know that this was something unlikely to be approved, I think the burden of paying this should fall on you as the person who gave him a credit card without making sure he knew what his limits were. Now if the intern said, that he knew he shouldn't be there and that those were his personal expenses and not client entertainment, then he should have the cost deducted from his pay. But if he had no idea that this was something he shouldn't do, then this is YOUR mistake not his. If he did take the client to a strip club, then you need to find out whose idea it was. If it was the client's idea, then tell the intern he should check with you before spending that kind of money or going to that sort of place. If it was the intern's idea, you may need to call the client yourself and make sure he is still happy with your company (you need not mention the strip club, just do a follow up and find out if he is feeling happy or needs something more). In any event, you need to make it crystal clear to the intern that this is something he should not discuss with any work colleagues or anyone outside the office. He can damage a client's reputation and lose the contract. 

Of course it is not scientific. Yes recruiters and hiring managers make a lot of poor choices. What they are hoping for is that they will err on the side of excluding a good person rather than erring on the side of hiring a bad one. There is sometimes some pseudo science involved (personality tests come to mind or those designed supposedly to find who will steal from the company) but these are more to remove the blame fora bad hire from the hiring offical. If you do something that looks scientific then obviously a bad hire is the fault of the process not your judgement. There is a large industry of people selling these products, but the ones I have run into are shaky at best. For instnce I failed one because my answers were too positive. They apparently didn't believe that I don't drink to excess, don't beat up people, don't come to work high, and don't steal even little things. I personally would not have thought that behavior was unusual. But it did serve to show me that I didn't want that job anyway. There is nothing scientific about hiring and there never will be because a huge part of it is not only assessing skills (which isn't even easy to do in a scientific way or lots of current developers would not have jobs!) but assesing how the person will fit in with the existing employees (totally subjective judgement) and how the person rates in comparison to the others you interview. Yes answers that will get you hired one place will be the ones that throw you out of competion somewhere else becasue we are all looking for something differnt and we are all assesing a diffent group of candidates. Yes different hiring managers will interpret various actions differently (personally I am perfectly happy if someone leaves and interview and then takes the time to find the correct answer to something they knew missed). My solution to that is to be myself. A company that likes who I am is one I am far more likely to be successful at anyway. One that doesn't like who I am is a place where I won't want to work anyway no matter the salary or benefits offered. 

When setting up new people, think in terms of putting them into groups and then rights for various things are set by groups, automated emails are sent to (and sent from) specific email groups never individuals, database rights are set by group not by individual (even if only one individual is in the group). Then when someone leaves is it simpler to simply remove him from any groups and put his replacement in the groups he was in. This doesn't fix everything but it can work for database access and email issues. JObs on the database server should have a dedicated account that is never an individual as the owner, so that things don't stop working because the guy who created the job no longer has access. 

All things about a resume can be different depending on the job you are going for and the skills you possess. My resume has Accomplishments (by far the most critical part), Skills (for the HR filters and as short as possible), Work History (Very short, the important stuff is in accomplishments) and Education (no more than 2-3 lines). If I was a recent grad with little or no work history, I would probably put education first and add more detail. Under no circumstances, make the resume more than two pages in the US. Most hiring managers I have known will throw out longer ones without reading as they waste their time. If I can get my 30+years of experience in a two page resume so can you. Generally no one expects you to put in more than the last ten years anyway. The Objective section has always been worthless and and will never get you the job. It may get you disqualified though, so don't waste precious space on it. If you think your blog, etc. is important and you have the space, then put it in, or you could put it in a cover letter if you choose. Just be aware that anything you say in this line may be looked at, so if it (espcially a blog) is not impressive, don't bother. Some people will have a portfolio of work that they link to and if you have that and the work is good and it doesn't violate any confidentiality agreements with your employer, then please feel free to impress by including that. Never pay anyone to prepare your resume. Having looked at thousands of resumes over the years, you can spot the ones from resume companies in an instant (they tend to use the exact same phrases and format for everyone) and that will also automatically ensure your resume gets less attention as many if not most of those resumes are extremely exaggerated. It impresses no one that you can't put your own resume together. Many people send Word .doc or .docx files but if you are sending to a recruiter, it is often best to send a .pdf as recruiters will sometimes "fix up" your resume (i.e., lie about your experience) before passing it along. 

Just ask as if you had not heard that as your friends probably should not have shared it. But be prepared that they may not decide to keep you. If they told the others they could come back and not you, that is often an indicator that they think you are the weaker performer. If they do turn you down, talk to the manager about what you can do better in your next internship and fix that at your next company. 

Define unreasonable demands. What you see as unreasonable may be reasonable from a different perspective. You may need to adjust to the standards of the person above you (who is after all the one responsible for the results) or move on. However, with a person like this who wants to ignore what you say when you object in person, always follow up the conversation with one in writing. You may need to work on how you present your objections. Remember the only person in the relationship whose actions that you can change is yourself. If you want differnt resluts, you need to do things differently. Keep your side completely neutral. Explain why something is unreasonable with facts. For instance suppose the deadline is unreasonable. You point out that the deadline will not be met because there are X hours of work time available and x tasks left to do which will take x hours. For deadline issues, always point out this problem in writing and as soon as you know the deadline is not reasonable. Ask which tasks you can eliminate (or push to a future sprint) in order to meet the deadline or what to do. It is the PMs job decide how to resolve the problem and you are giving him or her facts to allow a good decision to be made. He is the one who will look the worst if the problem is not solved and the deadline missed particualry if he chose not to pass the bad news up the chain. In particular do not use emotionally charged words like impossible, unreasonable, stupid. And do not lose your temper. You are providing information, His.her job is to make decisions. It is not your job to agree with the decisions but to do your best to make them work. And timing is critical, get in your points before decsions are made or announced outside the group whenever possible. Telling someone that a deadline that has been promised to a client cannot be met is a much harder sell than before the client is told. Now if you followup with reasonable suggestions about how to handle the problem and with facts concerning why ther problem exists in writing, you can never be successfully accused of not talking to the PM first before escalating an issue because you have proof that you did. Now escalating is tricky when it is your direct boss. Sometimes all it takes is adding his boss to the email chain after several go-arounds. Sometimes you just have to accept that these people are not going to change and to move on because you will get no support from above. Sometimes it is best to let the chips fall where they may and let the project miss its deadline, and bring up that you objected to the deadline in writing during the post mortem of the failure. Usually before you escalate, you should tell the person that you are going to escalate and why and ask for a meeting with all three of you to explain your position. It is best to go into such a meeting with a "how can we work it out" attitude rather than an adversarial one. If you have to escalate something to your boss's boss, you want to be the one who sounds reasonable not the one who sounds like a raging idiot. Remember that it may not be the PM at fault here, the actual decision you object to may have been made by someone higher up the chain and he/she is stuck with it too. So be caerful what you escalate - make sure it is something mission critical and something that is, in fact, not possible, not just something you don't like. No company likes having a constant complainer, they also don't like failures due to people being afraid to tell them the truth. It is a fine line you are walking here. That is why it is critical that you only bring up mission critical issues and let minor disagreements go. Anytime 2 people work on the same project, there are going to be professional disagreements. You need to learn which battles to fight in order to be effective. You also need to be seen as cooperative and willing to make the effort the rest of the time. 

I would say it is unethical to round your GPA. After all, they might want a transcript as part of the background check and what you have in your resume should match that. I would also be concerned about anyone who expected me to do so and wonder if they would be someone who I would not want to work for as they are likely to be unethical about other, more important, issues. Your mileage may vary. 

First don't panic. It may take some time to get a job but you can get one. Concentrate first on filing for unemployment and look at all the costs at home you can cut out temporarily and I mean everything - kids cell phones, cable tv, any monthly subscriptions like Netflix, dining out, ways to lower the water and electric bills etc. Your college age child should be filing new paperwork for financial aid since you are now unemployed and may now qualify for aid he didn't get. Then sit down and craft a great resume - it's a marketing document so that should be right up your alley. You do not need to indicate anything more than ten years experience, so it will not be apparent immediately that you are older than your 30s. Grab a book like What Color is Your Parachute from the library (you aren't spending money) and work with it to determine what you want to do. Put together a sample portfolio of public facing sites you have created so people can see some of your work. Make them want to hire you long before they ever meet you. 

Politics are necessary to drive change in 100% of all organizations. Sometimes the politics are less obvious than others. But they are always there and if you want to be change driver in your organization, you cannot afford to not play politics. You need allies and you need to have a repuation for being someone who can deliver. You probably have none of those things if you are too pure to play politics and so the resistance is stronger to what you propose. However, it is not surpriseing there is resitance to the change,. You can expect that for any but the most minor change. That is noraml and ordinary and should be accounted for in planning by anyone who hopes to drive change. You have to actually listen to the objections and ask them to help you design to overcome them. Putting out a proposal without consulting anyone about it beforehand and lining up allies who also think this is a workable idea before you every present it is the path to having your idea turned down. You ahve to be willing to get some of what you want by compromising and giving them some of waht they want. An idea partially implem,ented leaves room to improve it later, an idea flatly turend down does not. What is wrong with letting them have the veto and seeing how things work? Maybe they are right that subjective hiring is better in some instances? Can you honestly test the most important skills involved for the job? They want assurance that the test actually works before giving you carte blanche and that is actually pretty reasonable.
