I'm considering a story set about fifty years (2065) in the future. It takes a rather optimistic view; space exploration has led to colonies on the Moon and Mars, as well as several space stations orbiting Venus for scientific purposes. There are currently several exploratory missions planned or in progress for the Jovian and Saturnian moons. The main form of travel is still chemical rockets, regrettably, although ion engines have recently become fashionable since larger quantities of thrust were achieved in 2058. We can get from Earth to the Moon in two days and Venus or Mars in three months (suspend your disbelief). The majority of travel takes place using the following method: 

My TL;DR: Yes. Could such a scenario (referring to the planet being within the habitable zones of all three stars) exist? I'd think not. This arrangement would not be stable. Sure, multiple-star systems exist - and there have been systems discovered with up to 7 stars - but there's almost no way the planet could continue to be in the habitable zone of all three for more than a very short amount of time. In fact, I think it's likely that the system would consist of one star orbiting the other two, as is the case in Alpha Centauri. But I guess I'll disregard that, although I think this is a valid point for the reality-check tag. I can elaborate on this if you want me to, but I can avoid it for now. Back to the question: 

This is only a partial answer (it only addresses land animals), but I don't know if anyone else is going to mention it, so I might as well. Land animals rely on their bodies to support their weight. A lot of that support comes from their bones. Now, a bigger animal will have bigger bones, so the volume of one of them (I'll say the femur) must be larger. However, to support the added weight, the bone must also be thicker (i.e. greater in diameter). As animals get larger, the thickness of femurs keeps increasing until the thickness is unfeasibly large. Past this point, any animal could not have a femur of the correct size, and thus there is a weight limit (and thus size limit) to any land animal. Note: This section was essentially a summary of Appendix A of my copy of Professor Walter Lewin's book, For the Love of Physics. It goes into more detail than I did here, but I think this paragraph should be sufficient to communicate this [minor, for the purposes of your question] point. 

Also, keep in mind that the boy's initial gravitational potential energy at the surface has now been converted into kinetic energy, meaning that he's moving at a speed of . . . oh, I'm not going to do the calculations, but it's really, really, really fast. The result of suddenly finding himself rushing through a solid object at this speed could be compared to building a brick wall across the track during the Indy 500, but that doesn't quite do it justice. You do say that he's stopped his oscillations, which didn't occur to me when I wrote the above paragraph. However, Hypnosifl's concerns are also my own. There's no mechanism to dissipate his energy if he isn't interacting with anything. 

L4 and L5 are stable Lagrange points. If an object at one of them was perturbed by some other body such that it moved away slightly from the point, it would move back to the point, thus ensuring stability. A good analogy is to picture these points as bowls, places of stable equilibrium. Imagine that the space station is a ball in the bowl. If the ball is somewhat jostled, it may roll up one of the sides a little, but it will come back down to its original stable position. So it's possible for an object to occupy the exact (well, it does depend on what you mean by "exact") point. This is not true for all perturbations. There is a limit to the stability, generally reached if another body orbiting the Sun is massive enough and close enough. However, this is not the case for the Earth-Sun L4 and L5 points. 

So no, these faster-than-light ships would not entirely replace telescopes immediately. You'd see a balance between the two, with radio telescopes being gradually phased out if (and only if) radio arrays were feasibly on these spacecraft. Eventually, you'd see only a few telescopes left on Earth or in Earth orbit. But I'd bet you anything that they'd be probing the sky for radio waves. 

The Oort Cloud The far edge of the Oort Cloud is believed to be 100,000 AU from the Sun. In fact, Duncan et al. (1987) created simulations that showed the inner edge of the Cloud to be at ~3,000 AU. Given that 1 AU $\approx$ 8 light-minutes, $$3,000\text{ AU}\times\frac{8\text{ light-minutes}}{\text{AU}}=24,000\text{ light-minutes}\gg1\text{ light-day}$$ Therefore, any signals - even from the inner edge of the Cloud - will not reach Earth for far more than one day, at which point the ship will be long gone. Furthermore, any signals - even gamma-rays - should be reduced in strength, compared to signals from areas near any of the planets, the Sun, or the asteroid belt.

Tundras are found in the far north (and south, if there was much land in the southern hemisphere that's not Antarctica). It is characterized by permafrost, meaning you need mean temperatures around -5°C. 60-70° North and 60-70° South are probably reasonable lower limits. Boreal forests and the taiga will be just to the south of the tundra. Conifers are adapted to long, harsh winters, and so are found far from the equator. Your placement of the boreal forest near the rainforest is unlikely; I would suggest moving it north, above the badlands/steppe you have marked out on the same continent. Rainforests are usually clustered around the equator; see in particular northern South America and central Africa, as well as parts of southeast Asia. 10-20° North and 10-20° South should include much of this zone. Wetlands may vary, depending on how you define "wetland", and can venture much further from the equator, perhaps up to 50° latitude. Your placement of both, in tropical regions, seems pretty reasonable to me. Savannas can vary in location depending on the placement of other biomes. Tropical savannas will be in the tropics, of course, while savannas in temperature regions might be closer to 30-40° from the equator. It's your choice - again, depending on the rest of the setup - and the transition to rainforest on your eastern continent could mirror the transition in Africa's equatorial rainforests. See this point for placement of plains, too. Deserts - assuming you mean something hot like the Sahara, not Antarctica - are dependent on rainfall and other local climate factors. They exist in a wide range of latitudes, from just beyond the equator (see the Sahara) to further away (see the Atacama). They may also be near savannas, which serve as transition regions. Your desert seems reasonable; I'm curious about how the existence of that mountain range could change things. The location of forests vary, depending on the type. Rainforests are near the equator, temperate forests are further away (maybe 30-50°), and boreal forests are, as I said before, closer to the poles. Your placement here seems reasonable, and might be on the dividing line between temperature and boreal, depending on how those mountains change wind currents and precipitation. Here are some things to note: 

What if the planet retained some of its gaseous envelope, as Brown has suggested? As a side note, this also arises from those theories that this planet is actually a rogue planet, although I'm not sure which one is more prevailing at the moment (I would think it's the former). We now have a mini-Neptune. This would mean that we have an envelope of hydrogen, helium, and water, ammonia, and other compounds in lower concentrations. The possibility of life here is low - certainly not life as we know it. The best chance may be for life on a moon of the planet, which could squeeze out - pun intended - some energy from tidal heating, thanks to its parent planet. But the odds of this are low - not zero, but low. 

I chose Xi Boötis because it is really one of the only candidates that match nearly all the criteria. Both stars are of the correct spectral type. Additionally, it admits orbits with semi-major axes in the ranges you gave. Sources: Fernandes et al. (1998) 

Absolutely, positively, not quantitatively correct. In any work where you're trying to use a super-science-y explanation, you have to gauge your audience well. At times . . . I'm not good at that. Some of my answers here should make that apparent. You need to consider two main, related things: 

Okay, let's do some calculations. Mass of Earth ($M_E$): $5.97219 \times 10^{24} \text{ kg}$ Speed of Earth: The Earth completes one orbit ($2 \pi r = 2 \pi (150,000,000 \text {km}) = 300,000,000 \pi \text { km}$) in $31557600 \text { seconds}$ (using 1 years as 365.25 days. This means it has an angular velocity $\omega$ of $1.991021278 \times 10^{-7} \text { radians/second}$. Using the formula for tangential velocity, $v=r \omega$, we find $v=29865.31916 \text { m/s}$, if the Sun if the point of reference. This leads us to the kinetic energy by $KE=\frac{1}{2}mv^2=2.663409478 \times 10^{33} \text{ Joules}$. The Earth is moving, so we have to use $$E=\sqrt{p^2c^2+m^2c^4}$$ Defining $p$ as $mv=1.783613604 \times 10^{29} \text{ kg} \text{ m/s}$, We find $$E=5.374971 \times 10^{41} \text{ Joules}$$ Add this energy to the kinetic energy to find that the total energy released is $$5.374971027 \times 10^{41} \text{ Joules}$$ Now we use 

I've boxed in the area between $2M_{\oplus}$ and $5M_{\oplus}$, the area where we're likely to see gas dwarfs, at some likely envelope radii. The atmospheres are likely to be 30%-100% hydrogen and helium, meaning that they can be 70%-0% oxygen (and other heavy gases, which can be just as dangerous if their partial pressures are increased). At 70% oxygen, effects start to appear at total pressures of about 45 kPa; at 0% oxygen, humans can't survive (the minimum should be 10%-20%, depending on the total pressure). I don't know what the likely total pressures are - which could help us narrow down the range - but it seems like you've got a decent amount of wiggle room, in your gas dwarf scenario. I assume there would be some atmospheric stratification, as suggested by Ville Nieme, but I don't know for sure. 

The important thing here is how the moon formed. Earth's moon formed in a scenario explained by the Giant Impact Hypothesis: 

It's interesting to note that two of these are in the same system, orbiting Kepler-62. Also, if you peruse this list, you'll note that they do run the gamut of Earth-mass planets. If you look at enough ocean planets, you'll almost surely find one with a surface gravity of roughly $g$, 9.8 meters per second squared. Honestly, if you don't mind some rather dull views, life on an ocean planet would be quite manageable for, say, human colonists, given the right atmosphere and the right tech. 

It uses the following parameterizations: $$\mathbf{L}=(\sqrt{t},te^{-t}),\quad0\leq t\leq49,\quad\mathbf{B}_n=(s,s/4),\quad0\leq s\leq7$$ Here’s the result: 

Now, remember that these are merely normalized values, and should be multiplied by the central parameters, but the point remains: Quasi-stars are much different than normal stars. Evolution The one remaining question is whether or not our quasi-star will remain stable for any significant amount of time. It’s certain that the mass of the central black hole will change, as the object is powered by accretion from the inner edge of the envelope. Eventually, the quasi-star will be pretty much a black hole with a little bit of gas around it. In the shorter term, the stability of the envelope, for instance, poses a potential problem. It will also be losing mass, as well as accreting it from a disk that may form, surrounding the entire object. Ball et al. found that $$\dot{M_{\text{BH}}}\propto M_{\text{BH}}^2\rho^{(3-\gamma)/2}\tag{8}$$ To within an order of magnitude, this remains around $\sim10^{-4}M_{\odot}$ per year for many quasi-stars at various stages of evolution. Assuming that the envelope mass of our quasi-star is $\sim100M_{\odot}$, then the envelope should be entirely accreted on a timescale of one million to ten million years, up to a factor of a few. That’s quite reasonable; massive stars typically travel through the main sequence on the order of one million to ten million years, and so while the quasi-star may live for only a short amount of time in comparison to the Sun, its lifetime is reasonable when compared to massive stars. Will fusion be possible? One key assumption of quasi-star models is that any fusion is completely negligible. This particular quasi-star is certainly not normal, so I'd like to double-check and see if there will in fact be little or no fusion. We can do this by calculating the reaction rates of the quasi-star compared to those of the Sun. (I'd like to assume that any fusion occurs via the p-p chain. The CNO cycle is not possible in a star without carbon, nitrogen or oxygen!) The rate of energy generation $q{ij}$ from a reaction of particles $_i$ and $_j$ is $$q_{ij}=\overbrace{C_1\left(\frac{1}{1+\delta_{ij}}\right)\frac{1}{A_iA_j}\frac{1}{AZ_iZ_j}}^{S_{ij}}X_iX_j\rho\tau^2e^{-\tau}Q\tag{9}$$ where $C_1$ is some collection of constants not unique to the stellar environment, $\rho$ is the density, $X_I$ and $A_i$ represent mass fraction and mass number (while $A$ is reduced (atomic!) mass), $Z_i$ is atomic number, $Q$ is the energy released per reaction, $\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta, and $\tau$ is a peculiar function of temperature: $$\tau=C_2\left(Z_i^2Z_j^2AT^{-1}\right)^{1/3}=D_{ij}T^{-1/3}\tag{10}$$ where $C_2$ is another constant. I've scrunched together a bunch of terms together as $S_{ij}$; you'll see why later. Let's find the ratio of $q_{ij,\odot}$ (the Sun) to $q_{ij,*}$ (the quasistar): $$\frac{q_{ij,\odot}}{q_{ij,*}}=\frac{S_{ij}X_{i,\odot}X_{j,\odot}\rho_{\odot}\tau_{\odot}^2e^{-\tau_{\odot}}Q}{S_{ij}X_{i,*}X_{j,*}\rho_{*}\tau_*^2e^{-\tau_*}Q}\tag{11}$$ Both factors of $S_{ij}$ cancel out (as do the $Q$s), leaving us with something much simpler. For the quasi-star, we can look at the highest values of temperature and pressure, the central values we picked earlier. I'll take $\rho_{c,*}=5.426\times10^{-5}\text{ g cm}^{-3}$ and $T_{c,*}\simeq3.5\times10^{5}\text{ K}$, as per Table 1 of Ball et al. I already assumed that the quasi-star envelope is pure hydrogen, so $X_i=X_j=1$. For the Sun, I'll use the BS05(AGS, OP) solar model by John Bahcall. This gives $X_i=X_j=0.36462$, $\rho=1.505\times10^2\text{ g cm}^{-3}$, and $T_{c,\odot}=1.548\times10^{7}\text{ K}$. Substituting some of this gives $$\frac{q_{ij,\odot}}{q_{ij,*}}=\frac{(0.36462)^21.505\times10^{2}\text{ g cm}^{-3}\tau_{\odot}^2e^{-\tau_{\odot}}}{(1)^25.462\times10^{-5}\text{ g cm}^{-3}\tau_*^2e^{-\tau_*}}=3.66\times10^5\frac{D_{ij}^2T_{\odot}^{-2/3}e^{-\tau_{\odot}}}{D_{ij}^2T_*^{-2/3}e^{-\tau_*}}$$ More substitutions give $$\frac{q_{ij,\odot}}{q_{ij,*}}=2.9\times10^4e^{\tau_*-\tau_{\odot}}$$ In our case, $D_{ij}$ is $42.46\mu^{1/3}$, with $\mu$ being the reduced mass (note that $\mu\neq A$), if $T$ is expressed in mega-Kelvin (i.e. millions of Kelvin). We can figure out that $\tau_*>\tau_{\odot}$ because $T_{c,*}<T_{c,\odot}$, and therefore $$e^{\tau_*-\tau_{\odot}}>e^0=1$$ Therefore, $\frac{q_{ij,\odot}}{q_{ij,*}}\gg1$, and it appears that any fusion will be insignificant.
