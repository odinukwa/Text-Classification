The question is not really my business, but I can give a stock answer. It might be a good answer in the sense that it convinces an outsider like me. The narrowest version of the inverse Galois problem, find all of the Galois groups of finite extensions of $\mathbb{Q}$, might not be all that interesting. A better question would be the following: Let $G$ be a finite group and let $\mathbb{F}$ be a field of characteristic 0 (or more generally a perfect field). Can you describe the set (or moduli space if you like) of all Galois extensions of $\mathbb{F}$ over $G$? For instance if $G = C_2$, it's a good question with a good answer; the question is a model of taking square roots of elements of $\mathbb{F}$. With that special case in mind, it's always a good question. It can be viewed as a theory of nonabelian surds. If for a given field $\mathbb{F}$ and a given finite group $G$, you don't even know if there are any points in the moduli space of extensions with Galois group $G$, then you hardly know anything. In particular, $\mathbb{Q}$ is an important field, and there are many specific finite groups for which people don't even know that much. 

There are really two questions here: (1) Can you an untangle any unknot with relatively little work, say a polynomial number of geometric moves of some kind? (2) Given a knot, can you quickly figure out that it is an unknot, say with a polynomial amount of thought? It seems that both questions are open and that neither one implies a solution to the other. You do get an elementary relation in one direction, which however is not useful for current bounds: If you have a good bound on the number of moves, then you can do an exhaustive search to find them. Except maybe for improved constants, I do not know of rigorous bounds that are better than the Hass-Lagarias result that you need at most an exponential number of moves [arXiv:math/9807012], and the Hass-Lagarias-Pippenger result that unknottedness is in NP [arXiv:math/9807016]. In fact the two results are related in the converse direction. Their certificate of unknottedness is a disk which may have exponential area and gives you the moves; but the disk has a polynomial-length description. As Timothy Chow says, being both in NP and coNP is certainly not strong evidence by itself that unknottedness is in P. On the contrary, people believe that NP ∩ coNP is much bigger than P. But there is no strong reason to believe that unknottedness is hard or easy as far as I know. There is a theorem of Thurston and Garside that a trivial braid can be recognized in polynomial time; maybe the same is true of the unknot. One question that interests me, maybe for no good reason, is whether unknottedness is in BQP (quantum polynomial time). As Tom says, if people do find a polynomial-time algorithm to tell if a knot is the unknot, it almost certainly won't be by computing its Khovanov homology. It's known to be #P-hard to compute the Jones polynomial of a knot, or even to derive various sorts of partial information about the Jones polynomial. For instance, usually a single value is already #P-hard. Khovanov homology, its categorification, is even more information. It is a theorem of Kronheimer and Mrowka that Khovanov homology distinguishes the unknot; this is also a conjecture for the original Jones polynomial. In other words, if you do find a fast algorithm to distinguish the unknot, there will be many large knots for which you can say, "No, that isn't unknot!" even though you won't know its Jones polynomial or its Khovanov homology in a million years. You'll just know that the latter and probably the former isn't trivial. 

One could say that the story begins with Beilinson's conjectures on the existence of a theory of motivic cohomology. In accordance with the insights of the Grothendieck school that cohomology theories in nature always come with a corresponding "category of coefficients", and that it is very often profitable to work at the categorical level instead of at the level of cohomology groups, Beilinson also conjectured that there should exist triangulated categories $DM(S, \mathbf{Z})$, where the conjectural motivic cohomology groups can be computed as Ext-groups. By a category of coefficients I mean a system of (triangulated) categories, for each scheme $S$, equipped with the formalism of six operations (the objects are thought of as "coefficients" for cohomology). When Voevodsky set out to construct these categories $DM(S,\mathbf{Z})$, he was guided strongly by the principle that motivic cohomology should play the role in algebraic geometry of singular cohomology of smooth manifolds, whose category of coefficients is the derived category of chain complexes of abelian groups. In fact, singular cohomology is only one of many "generalized cohomology theories" on smooth manifolds (other examples include topological K-theory and cobordism), and unlike singular cohomology, most cohomology theories cannot be computed as the cohomology groups of a chain complex, but rather must be defined as the homotopy groups of a space or spectrum. Thus, inspired by the Eilenberg-Steenrod axioms, let's define a cohomology theory on smooth manifolds to be a presheaf $\mathcal{F}$ of spaces on the category of smooth manifolds satisfying two conditions. First we require that it is homotopy invariant: we have $H^i(X \times \mathbf{R}, \mathcal{F}) \simeq H^i(X, \mathcal{F})$ for all smooth manifolds $X$, where $H^{-*}(X, \mathcal{F})$ denote the homotopy groups of the space $\mathcal{F}(X)$. Secondly we require the existence of Mayer-Vietoris long exact sequences (or more precisely that $\mathcal{F}$ satisfies a homotopical version of the sheaf condition). Then one can prove that the category of cohomology theories in this sense is equivalent to the homotopy category of spaces (to make precise sense of the "category of cohomology theories" one should use homotopical or higher categorical language). If we take presheaves valued in chain complexes instead, we get a category equivalent to the derived category of abelian groups (= the category of coefficients for singular cohomology). Voevodsky's first construction of DM, which goes back to his 1992 thesis, was directly inspired by the above. Thus the idea was to take presheaves of chain complexes on schemes (over some fixed base $S$), and impose homotopy invariance with respect to the affine line $\mathbf{A}^1$ instead of the real line. An important question is then which Grothendieck topology to take for the sheaf condition. Instead of the Zariski or Nisnevich topologies, Voevodsky used a topology he called the "h-topology", which is essentially what you get when you take the Zariski topology and you add in proper surjections as coverings (the name came from his expectation that this topology seemed to be "suitable for the developing of the homotopy theory of schemes"). With this definition he was able to construct Gysin sequences and prove projective bundle and blow-up formulas in motivic cohomology. Let's come back to the setting of smooth manifolds for a moment. The Dold-Thom theorem says that the (reduced) singular homology groups of a smooth manifold $X$ can be computed as the homotopy groups of the infinite symmetric power $S^\infty(X)$. Inspired by this, Suslin constructed a singular homology theory for schemes by taking an algebraic analogue of infinite symmetric powers. In 1996, Suslin and Voevodsky were able to prove a comparison of Suslin's singular homology construction with étale cohomology with torsion coefficients. After this work, I think Voevodsky realized that what was really important was perhaps not the h-topology itself, but just the fact that h-sheaves automatically admit transfers. Indeed, the existence of Gysin sequences and projective bundle formula only actually require the Nisnevich topology. In view of this he then defined (the effective version of) DM in the form we use today, which is more or less rigged so that hom groups in the category compute Suslin homology (at least over a field). The idea is that instead of using the h-topology, we just use the Nisnevich topology but then force our presheaves to have the additional structure of transfers in a different way: we take presheaves on the category whose objects are smooth $S$-schemes, but whose morphisms are Voevodsky's finite correspondences. Above I have been discussing the effective categories $DM^{eff}(S,\mathbf{Z})$. The non-effective version $DM(S,\mathbf{Z})$ is just obtained by forcing the Tate twist operation $X \mapsto X(1) := X \otimes \mathbf{Z}(1)$ to become invertible. This is analogous to the relationship between the bounded-below derived category $D^+(\mathbf{Z})$ and the unbounded derived category $D(\mathbf{Z})$, where the latter can be thought of as taking $D^+(\mathbf{Z})$ and forcing the suspension functor $[1]$ to become invertible. The main motivation is to be able to express duality phenomena: for example, one can prove that for a smooth proper $S$-scheme $X$ of relative dimension $n$, the dual of the motive $M(X) \in DM(S,\mathbf{Z})$ is given by $M(X)(-n)[-2n]$. For a reference on triangulated categories of motives, I would recommend the book on the subject by Cisinski and Déglise. A shorter reference that could be easier to start with is the paper "Finite correspondences and transfers over a regular base" by Déglise. 

Some other papers have pointed out that this proposition is incorrect as stated, and continuity of $W$ should be imposed. But this is just a minor problem. I was puzzled by the question posed above. Let's consider the if part. We could easily show tightness of each coordinate sequence of $\{W_n\}$ and so tightness of $\{W_n\}$ itself. Prokhorov's theorem tells us that now it suffices to show that $W$ is the only possible limit. This would be done once we show finite dimensional convergence along continuities of $W$. But is the "Cramer-Wold"-like condition really sufficient to entail finite-dimensional convergence? I really can't see how. 

Unfortunately, I fail to see why Cramer-Wold device applies here: $(W_n(t_1), ..., W_n(t_k))$ is a $d \times k$-matrix, so it seems we need to show $$ \alpha' \mathrm{vec}(W_n(t_1), ..., W_n(t_k)) \stackrel{d}{\longrightarrow} \alpha' \mathrm{vec}(W(t_1), ..., W(t_k)) $$ for any $dk \times 1$-vector $\alpha$, which is more stringent than the assumption. 

To keep the question short: Let $C([0,1], \mathbb{R}^d)$, $d \geq 2$ be the space of all $\mathbb{R}^d$-valued continuous processes. $X$ and $Y$ are two $C([0,1],\mathbb{R}^d)$-valued random variates, and we know that $\lambda' X \stackrel{d}{=} \lambda' Y$ for all $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}^d$. Is it necessary the case that $X \stackrel{d}{=} Y$? 

More$\times 2$ Details: In some other book, I see a proof of the (if part of the) same proposition, which goes like this: 

In some sense, the "universal" version of this fact was proved by Blumberg-Gepner-Tabuada as Proposition 3.3 in this paper. That is, they proved the analogue for stable $\infty$-categories, which is the description of the $\infty$-category $Fun^{ex}(A, B)$, the internal hom in the $\infty$-category of idempotent complete stable $\infty$-categories and exact functors, via what they call "right-compact" $A$-$B$-bimodules, which are the analogue of right quasi-representable functors or quasi-functors. In fact, the proof is much nicer in this setting. I claim that any "reasonable" version of Toën's theorem should follow from this version. By that I mean for any $\mathcal{V}$ such that $\mathcal{V}$-categories model some version of stable $\infty$-categories (so that my claim is basically tautological). For example, for spectral categories ($\mathcal{V}$-categories where $\mathcal{V}$ is the symmetric monoidal model category of symmetric spectra), this follows from the equivalence in Theorem 1.10 between idempotent complete stable $\infty$-categories, and spectral categories up to Morita equivalence. For dg-categories, it should follow similarly by using the equivalence between dg-categories and linear stable $\infty$-categories. (Note that the internal hom in the $\infty$-category of dg-categories is the same as the derived internal hom in the model category of dg-categories.) 

We can then view the pair $(C,W)$ as a presentation or model of the associated $(\infty,1)$-category. For example, the homotopy theories of topological spaces and simplicial sets are both models of the same $(\infty,1)$-category. 3) The theorem of Barwick-Kan tells us that, from the perspective of homotopy theory, there is no difference between homotopy theories or say, quasi-categories. However, from the perspective of category theory, these two models are very different. The question is about how to access categorical information in a given homotopy theory $(C,W)$. That is, in ordinary category theory, we are used to talking about objects, morphisms, functors, limits and colimits, presheaves, the Yoneda lemma, and so on. We have $(\infty,1)$-categorical versions of all these things, but how do we see them inside a given pair $(C, W)$? Of course, we may always look at the respective operations in the underlying category $C$, but these will in general not be compatible with our class of weak equivalences (e.g. the (co)limit of two weakly equivalent diagrams may not be weakly equivalent). We can view the theory of model categories as a solution to this problem: the idea is to endow the pair $(C,W)$ with a model structure, i.e. the structure of cofibrations and fibrations in an appropriately nice way. Doing this is usually nontrivial, but when possible, it gives us a powerful way to compute things like homotopy (co)limits, namely by computing them in the underlying category $C$ after taking suitable (co)fibrant replacements. We should keep in mind though that what we really care about are homotopy theories. Despite the effectiveness of model categories, it is a fact that the choice of specific model-categorical presentation adds a factor of arbitrariness to all constructions and proofs, and as a result does not always allow us to express ourselves quite as fluently as we are used to in ordinary category theory. Nowadays it is also common to work with other models of $(\infty,1)$-categories instead of working directly with homotopy theories; for example, the model of quasi-categories, developed by Joyal and Lurie, has an amazingly well-behaved category theory (even if it comes with its own difficulties). At the end of the day, these are all just equally valid approaches to working with homotopy theories. 

In various respects, the premise of the question is not really correct. First, you should not think that there is "the" Smith normal form algorithm. There are various algorithms to compute Smith normal form, and what you want in this case is a sparse algorithm. One sparse strategy to compute the Smith normal form (but not the only possible one) looks to simplify the matrix while keeping it as sparse as possible. There is no particular reason that simplifying a triangulation would go better than simplifying these matrices. Second, it is a theorem that there does not exist any reasonable algorithm to simplify all complicated triangulations of manifolds of dimension $n \ge 4$. It's uncomputable; it's equivalent to the halting problem. Third, as Ryan points out, you should consider generalized triangulations that consist of simplices glued arbitrarily along their faces. That is a much better choice than simplicial complexes. Then the staircase triangulation of the $n$-torus has $n!$ simplices. This is not great, because it grows factorially. But note that the actual homology groups grow exponentially. 

Theorem: A countable atlas of charts for a Hausdorff $n$-manifold $M$ can be refined to a locally finite atlas. In fact, each chart only needs to be trimmed. Proof: Let $U_1,U_2,\ldots$ be the charts. Each $U_i$, as a subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$, is the limit of a nested sequence of compact subsets $K_{i,1} \subseteq K_{i,2} \subseteq \ldots$. Since $M$ is Hausdorff, each $K_{i,j}$ is closed in $M$. So it suffices to delete $K_{1,i} \cup \cdots \cup K_{i-1,i}$ from $U_i$ to make a new chart $V_i$. Some of the $V_i$ might be empty, but this is no problem. 

The model structure on the category of dg-categories presents an $(\infty,1)$-category DGCat. This structure is essentially provided by the existence of mapping spaces (or mapping $\infty$-groupoids) between dg-categories. To see why DGCat admits the further structure of an $(\infty,2)$-category, it is sufficient to see why these mapping $\infty$-groupoids can be refined to mapping $(\infty,1)$-categories, which give back our mapping $\infty$-groupoids when we pass to the sub-$\infty$-groupoids of invertible morphisms. Such structure is provided by functor dg-categories, which are the internal hom objects in DGCat (in the "derived" sense -- these are denoted $R\underline{Hom}$ by Toen). These functor dg-categories give $(\infty,1)$-categories (by using for example the Dold-Kan correspondence), which provide the mapping $(\infty,1)$-categories in the $(\infty,2)$-category DGCat. (Toen showed that these mapping $(\infty,1)$-categories can also be described as the $(\infty,1)$-categories of right quasi-representable bimodules.) Edit: I just noticed that the preprint [Giovanni Faonte, $A_\infty$-functors and homotopy theory of dg-categories, arXiv:1412.1255] appears to contain a precise construction of the $(\infty,2)$-category of dg-categories. 

One should really only talk about $K_0$ of small categories, otherwise one runs into the difficulty explained in Matthias's comment. Assuming $\mathcal{B}$ is small, let me identify $\mathcal{A}$ with its essential image by $F$, which will be a (strictly) full triangulated category of $\mathcal{B}$. For a positive answer to your question, it is reasonable to impose the condition that $\mathcal{A}$ is dense in $\mathcal{B}$, i.e. every object of $\mathcal{B}$ is a direct summand of an object of $\mathcal{A}$. Then the claim is indeed true and follows for example from Thomason's classification theorem, which says that there is a bijection between dense strictly full triangulated subcategories $\mathcal{A} \subset \mathcal{B}$ and subgroups of the Grothendieck group $K_0(\mathcal{B})$. See Corllary 2.3 in [Thomason, The classification of triangulated subcategories, Comp. Math. 105 (1997), pp. 1-27]. 

I asked the same question on stackexchange (with less details) and decided to post it here. Hopefully it's close to the research level. Preliminary: I have a sequence of normalized partial sum processes $\{X_n(t): 0 \leq t \leq 1\}$ with the form $$ X_n(t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} \sum_{i=1}^{[nt]} \xi_i $$ Here $\{ \xi_i \}$ needs not be i.i.d. (since I am dealing with time series data), but I think it's not that instrumental here. Anyway, I managed to apply some functional central limit theorem to obtain $$ X_n \stackrel{d}{\longrightarrow} W $$ in the Skorohod space $D[0,1]$, where $W$ is a standard Wiener process. Main Setting: Let $0 < l < u < 1$ and $c > 0$ be fixed constants. Define the stopping times $$ \tau_n = \inf \{l \leq t \leq u: X_n(t) > c \} \wedge u $$ I would like to show weak convergence of the stopped partial sum processes $\{ X_n(\tau_n) \}$. Initially I guessed the limit is $W(\tau)$ with $$ \tau = \inf\{l \leq t \leq u: W(t) > c \} \wedge u $$ By virtue of Skorohod representation theorem we may just take the convergence as holding almost surely. Also since $W$ is continuous, we may just use the uniform metric $d(x,y) = \sup_{0 \leq t \leq 1} |x(t) - y(t)|$ to simplify the problem. However, after thinking for a while I realized that $X_n(\tau_n)$ needs not converge to $W(\tau)$. The problem I see is that we may well conceive the case where $W$ attains $c$ at some $t_0 < u$ but does not exceed $c$ on the whole compact interval $[l, u]$. In particular, let $W(u) < c$. By definition we have $\tau = u$. But in this case we may modify $X_n$ around $t_0$ to make them exceed $c$, so that $\tau_n$ would approximate $t_0$ rather than $\tau$, and $X_n(\tau_n)$ would approximate $c$ rather than $W(\tau) = W(u) < c$. Question: As said, I desire a weak convergence of $X_n(\tau_n)$ (I don't need closed-form of the limiting distribution function, as long as I can approximate it by means of Monte Carlo). Is it possible to show weak convergence of $X_n(\tau_n)$ (possibly to another limit than the one conjectured above) with the given information? Otherwise, what conditions could I impose (preferably on $\{ \xi_i \}$) to enforce the weak convergence? Any suggestion and pointer to reference would be more than welcome! 

shows that there are problems with extending the Spec functor from commutative rings to noncommutative rings. In particular, any functor Spec : Rings -> Spaces whose restriction to CRings coincides with the usual spectrum functor must map the matrix algebras $\mathrm{M}_n(\mathbf{C})$ ($n \ge 3$) to the empty space. One can still hope to have a spectrum in the category of locales or toposes. However, the following paper shows the same result for functors valued in either of these categories. 

Then the proof is as follows. Let $j : U \hookrightarrow X$ be an open immersion and $p : Y \to X$ an etale morphism defining an elementary Nisnevich square $$\require{AMScd} \begin{CD} W @>>> Y \\ @VVV @VV{p}V \\ U @>>{j}> X \end{CD}$$ We want to show that the square $$\require{AMScd} \begin{CD} K(X) @>{j^*}>> K(U) \\ @V{p^*}VV @VVV \\ K(Y) @>>> K(W) \end{CD}$$ is a homotopy cartesian square of connective spectra. (In the noetherian case, Morel-Voevodsky showed that Nisnevich descent is equivalent to this Brown-Gersten-style excision property; in the non-noetherian case, this should really be taken as the "correct" definition of the Nisnevich topology.) For this it is sufficient to show that there is an equivalence on homotopy fibres. 2) and 3) imply that the homotopy fibres are given by $K_{X-U}(X)$ and $K_{Y-W}(Y)$, respectively. Then the equivalence follows from the fact that there is already an equivalence $$ Perf_{X-U}(X) \stackrel{\sim}{\longrightarrow} Perf_{Y-W}(Y) $$ at the level of perfect complexes, by 1). This proof works for quasi-compact quasi-separated schemes. By the way, the same proof works for (qcqs) derived schemes. By far the most non-trivial part of the proof is 2), which was established in [B. Toen, Derived Azumaya algebras and generators for twisted derived categories, arXiv:1002.2599]. A proof of 1), attributed to Drinfeld, is given in [D. Gaitsgory, Notes on geometric Langlands: Quasi-coherent sheaves on stacks, pdf]. In fact, this probably even gives a proof for the spectral schemes of Lurie, modulo a key point in the proof of 2) which I do not know how to do in the setting of $E_\infty$-ring spectra (but this is probably just my ignorance).
