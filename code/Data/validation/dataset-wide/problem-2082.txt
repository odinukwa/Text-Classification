Employers/job adverts usually ask for too many things, for what would be their "ideal" candidate. It is not usual hiring people that do not fill in all the points, for several different reasons (cheaper, they like the candidate, they think the candidate has the potential to be a good fit, the requirements are exaggerated, many more). If you have got the (free) time to attend the interview, you have not got anything to lose, quite by the contrary, an interview is always another learning experience. Unless you feel the headhunter really screwed up, I would attend it. 

In the past I had a similar spell of a period of too many interviews, and I was getting already stressed out by the situation. Learn when to say "no", and ask the job description beforehand just to cut the profiles which are not a fit for you. I reached a point where I included in my linked.in profile "I do not accept job contacts without a job description". Another possible strategy that I have successfully used is trying to negotiate a screening call via phone or better yet, skype. "Look I am too busy the coming two weeks, however if we could do it via skype..."; this strategy can well shave two hours of an otherwise physical interview and going around the city, and is a good way (both for yourself and the interviewer) to get a feel of the opportunity. A good filter besides the skype strategy, is asking for changes on the hour of the interview. The bad ones will stand out, as they wont be accommodating/changing schedule for your convenience, and you would not to work with those kind of persons anyway. I can often have a busy schedule two or three days in a row, and from my personal experience, the nicest places to work are the ones that often are very flexible in the time to interview you. Another one of the possible filters is also asking for a salary range beforehand. Whilst that can be off hand for someone entering the industry, it has saved me (and the interviewer) the trouble in the past of investing time in pursuing positions that were not paying enough to attract my attention. I hope these tips help you. As a last tip, most of the email contacts are automated nowadays, and as such it is important to get some strategy to filter them out. Some of them are just a way for some RH agencies to have CVs on the back burner just in case. With time you will even distinguish pure spam - "we have a job offer for you, you just have to create an user in our professional social plataform to see it...." yeah, right (not made up)... 

Do not discount the situation. Know you local work laws, at least talk with your colleague. Back in here, depending on the contract, your boss missing the deadline for a mandatory written notification of your dismissal/renewal, means either the prior contract is already automatically renewed, of if it is the 3rd renewal or 4th renewal (laws change), it means it becomes permanent automatically. There are pretty much similar laws about automatic renewals deadlines in most countries. The point is, your boss potentially may have made a big mistake. The current email may not have any legal enforcement whatsoever, and the situation, or rather the inaction around it might have implications down the line in the not-so-near future in some legislations. Forward a copy of the specific email to your personal address and/or print it and take it home ASAP. The heated debate with your colleague may be because: 

Interviews are not a favour, are just a business proposition between two parties. Due to the dynamics of power at play, people often forget that. Do not get intimidated. If people are rude, tell them they did not get past on your interview (in more kinder terms). Depending on your personality and/or the interest on not closing doors, tell them either: 

Why would I recommend answering with a white lie, instead of telling you are not happy with the interviewer performance unless the behaviour or situation is not utterly outrageous/out of ordinary? 

I am afraid that what is more likely is they have been avoiding you as soon as they got what they wanted. This is a more than a known way to get work done for free by less reputable companies with false "interview" processes. In my home country, this scam is quite frequent with "interviews", "proofs of concept" and "competitions" for design work. Showing a portfolio or doing a work of several minutes may very well be an interview task; a design work of a couple of days, is anything but. Consider this a life learning experience and move on. Do not let yourself let be tricked into working for free next time. 

You should have started looking for a job the day you got the PIP notification. Jump ship and do not make the same mistakes. That said, while it is easier to restart with a clean slate, many of us when younger were given a 2nd opportunity, and it worked out. Try to have an honest talk with your superior about the subject. However, if he is saying time is short, I would say he already made up his mind about the subject; nevertheless tell him you have a passion for the field and will make a big effort to improve your soft skills. 

Some markets are too small to wear only one hat, and even so much less in small firms. The problem may stem from communication problems, lack of skill managements from your superiors, or both. Hiring time is normally the time to ask questions and clarify what the organization expects. Ultimately, if you are not happy, it may be time to move on and start looking for a new position. I pretty much doubt they can enterely accomodate for your wishes in a small/startup environment.. 

Unless you are very exceptional at your job, and/or your father is a politician and can get you very a string of very good customers, I would say it is still to early to leave the workforce. What some people that have stomach for a world of politics do, is working, usually later on life, as a public servant, leaving early and working on the side for their own in the remaining of the day for a risk-free life. I would advise to have at least between 5 or 10 years of work experience to launch your own consulting gig. As for your potentially killer app, nothing prevents you starting working on it. [cynic mode on] Start getting on politics/and or religion now for establishing a network of future customers. 

There seems to be an huge market to explore in Malasya, Phillipines and Indonesia with the right partners. Even Australia leaves a lot to desire on competencies on the IT field. I would start training to gain traction with smaller customers and cheaper prices, and once building a reputation, rising prices and trying to work for more countries. 

The situation is pretty common, and someone who managed to work 3 years in a place is exactly not a bad candidate. Besides the good advices in other answers, the best you can do is turn the tables in the interviewers. When describing your last job, you talk first about why you left. It avoids you being caught somewhat "off-guard", and also to shorten the time talking about it. It comes more naturally if you are the one broaching the subject, partly also because you know it will be the next move of the interviewer. Do not let the theme of you walking away from your former job dominate, or taking a lot of time of an interview. Show them you are an interesting candidate, and there are so much more good stories of work/life experience to talk about instead. 

I would tell Bob by that time of the day I was not able to think properly about the request, and would book a meeting with him, and some chaperones. Or would probably tell him I did not know how to do it, and let him prey on someone else. 

You cannot know for sure the nature of the interview without asking them. You are just assuming things. I also assumed heavy interviews when talking with technical people, and in a couple of times, they just wanted to know me as a possible future workmate as part of the process. Ask them wether the interview will just be a light chat, or testing your knowledge, and if it the former, you can have it, while ill, if the latter, say you would prefer to delay it a couple of days. Share a bit of the decision of delaying with them. They also get sick often in a while, and will most probably understand where you are coming from. 

Besides talking, I would start building a written trail. Logs events happening, and emails. I used to work in a placed that had some nasty politics on the side, and some people used and abused knowingly the fact that a spoken meeting/conversation has actually never happened unless there is something written about it. We actually even had a somewhat more senior person acting out that used to get a bit verbal when we sent emails detailing meetings. The advice about talking with the person in question is quite good, however I would sent a following up email with the talked and agreed points. 

The proliferation of open source, also will help put together a lab on the cheap, with virtualisation hypervisors like Xen, kvm or even bhyve. And other techonologies like docker or FreeBSD jails. For instance, for a interesting pre-made package to get your feet wet, have a look at proxmox. The key is to take the maximum advantage of your situation and be proactive in learning and experimenting. Use resources around. Read a lot. You will find out that with time, the concepts will start being more solid, things will be making more sense, and with experience the pieces of puzzle will start fitting together. As for my personal case, I was (almost) always the most senior person in my first sysadmin and network job, in my first consulting job, and in my first ISP job. It meant I had to put insane hours to get work done AND study at the same time, however it also enabled me to grasp things beyond what normally a singlehanded person knows. You really have to have an hand ons approach, and I ended up dealing with a lot of technology and situations that I would have had otherwise. Having almost said everything in contrary, I would advance that I had a position in a 3rd world country paid handsomely, and I left it after 5 years...and it was very good coming back to the "real world", and contacting with new technologies and methods. If I might do things differently if I could go back...I certainly would. The difference in the pay check makes a world of a difference. If I were in your shoes I would talk with your bosses about financing learning opportunities and establish a (formal) training plan for the near future. 

Aside from all the other great answers; create an excel document, or a shared Google spreadsheet, and start documenting everything and opening a line for every mishap. Without concrete evidence, management will otherwise think you just do not like the guy. 

Establish boundaries; the phone is yours and your alone; furthermore and even more important, it is your time. I would not waste more energy with the receptionist, since you already talked with her and she dismissed you. Simply change the phone number, and she will get the message across; the situation is even more simple, as she is bellow you in the chain of the command. However, since you mentioning your manager calling you through her, I would talk with him first, would explain the situation, and would tell him I would be changing to this number just to be used in emergencies by him, and only by him. There are several points here: - The fact is, that you carry a mobile, you cannot let people feel entitled to call you whenever pleases them; - More importantly, define how do you prefer to be contacted depending on the severity of the problem; I do prefer email to common day-to-day problems, google chat to help work mates, smses for rather urgent tasks, and well voice when the house is on fire, literally. - Depending on your position, you should also know when to STOP answering calls. In a major malfunction, I tell people I am at work, and turn my phone to silence. - If your colleagues do not respect the boundaries, depending on the situation, make an exception, but do remind them. "I do prefer to be contacted this way or another" - when and if contacted by customers, establish who put them through, and reinforce with them the appropriate formal channels, and tell them you are not at work. People are not machines, and they will understand. - People calling you outside your work hours should be seen as an exception and privilege, and not as an obligation. - There are also occasions where it is expected you will be without a phone for a reasonable amount of time (e.g. sex, the gym, the shower or the beach). - It is a severe lack of respect and professionalism to simply dial your number and put someone through. In the present and past I already had similar problems: 

The answer is not exactly clear cut: it depends on several factors, including industry, culture, opportunity and how much busy/free you are at work. Whilst we have a pretty family-friendly culture, and are highly lenient to having children around, it would be unthinkable to take family visiting when I worked as a consultant in the telecom or utilities industry customers, or even on our HQ. However, when I worked as expat in the telecom industry as IT manager, it was perfectly acceptable to show around friends and family. On the other hand, when I worked in Academia, it was perfectly acceptable to have family visiting, and some colleagues even brought their children for days in a row in the school holidays. 

Why not going consulting and remote work? I have a Filipino wife, and from my contact with the part of the world you are now, they have 

As others say, get a lawyer ASAP. Back in here, in the public sector at least, you would have other firms/subcontractors demanding the clarification and voiding the entire process due to transparency/anti-corruption/fairness laws, and in the extreme side, your organization could even be sued if the project went ahead. About it being a breach of ethics and conflit of interest there is absolutely no doubt, as per the legal consequences, it is highly location and industry specific. However, if this becomes widely known, it has the potential to blemish your organization too. 

Ask for a detailed pay slip when in doubt, you should receive one monthly even if in electronic form. This is a mandatory procedure in many countries. Get acquainted with local labor laws and with your work environment. This is the kind of stuff that you should be familiar with to look out for your rights. If in doubt, or needing a quick consultation, ask someone more experienced in the family or ask a local accountant. Local laws vary a lot. 

Today there are call outside job expectations, tomorrow they will worry you are not following up in a couple of minutes with work emails in your private time...(being sarcastic here)...Getting to business: Given strong European laws protecting employees, I would talk with an Union attorney/conselling person about this. I would undertand giving phones to a mobile force (e.g. a consulting/services) firm or to higher ups (upper management), and mainly to call them during business hours. Giving you a phone, or even having your private mobile number should not equate for them to call as they please. Usually businesses that need on call persorns do a roster schedule of one or two weeks per each employee, and rotate the work phone or voIP number between them. That means extra pay, a regular pay for being on call, and at least 3 hours pay and then hourly just for being called. In the past, when I was the IT director of an ISP, I was in the unfortunate position of having a phone number known between 2 and 4 thousand people, and if I did not manage when to pick up a call I would have gone crazy. I had several strategies for when called out from not picking up calls, ranging from "I was sleeping/walking/on the beach/making sex", and I was paid enough well to pick up the phone, however at the end of the day, it is your life and your personal time. I also put it in silent mode when taking care of sensitive malfunctions where I needed my cool and thinking on my feet, and let my help desk crew pick up the calls. People can be also rude, and think that giving you a phone, you are at their beck and call...I do remember a customer from whom I had never heard of ringing me 10 times in a Saturday night at 11PM, and still managing to complaint I obviously did not pick up the call. Clue in, having a phone does not means you have to pick it up to whoever decides to call you. I usually establish some boundaries;
