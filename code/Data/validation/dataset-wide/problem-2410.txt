"According to Buddhist doctrines, is there an illusion of the continuity of consciousness? Of the continuity of feelings? Of the continuity of the body?" Buddhism acknowledges that people hold to the above beliefs. That is, that people end up believing that consciousness, feelings, body, etc. are permanent. And the Buddha declared these beliefs as misleading. "I watched Yuttadhammo's video about rebirth and understood that Buddhists believe in perceived continuity of the consciousness after death. Is this a canonical opinion that can be concluded from Buddhist scriptures? How about the continuity of other aggregates?" I don't know which video you watched, but I would be surprised to know that Yuttadhammo claimed that consciousness (viññāṇa) transmigrates. There is a sutta about a bhikku named Sāti who was debunked by the Buddha for declaring this: 

[Additionally, it also states that a Buddha's disciple, at the end of the life span in these realms, attains nibbāna there, contrasted with a wordling that, after dying in such realms, reappears in a lower realm. AN 4.126 adds to the formula the contemplation of the three marks, which makes one reappears in companionship with the devas of the pure abodes -- a destination not shared with wordlings]. "Can you summarize what conclusion you draw, about..." In regard to the subject in question: 

"According to one of many sources, the definition of intention is described as 'Right intention [...]" Notice that the source you link to is not defining "intention" (aka "volition" from pali cetanā, or the related "volitional formations", "kamma formations" or "formations" from pali saṅkhāra), the psychological aspect of the mind associated to kamma, but "Right Intention" (also translated as "right thought", "right aspiration", "right resolve" from pali sammā sankappa) which describes instructions to develop oneself in the path, not an element of the psychological framework. "If my thought is the result of anger however i do not have intent to harm is that not the result of rational thought?" Just to contextualize: 

...as per the title. In the Theravada literature, the Buddha is seen as someone who found an end to suffering and taught that for all his life, urging his disciples to apply themselves to it, to not waste the opportunity and regret later. While there are many interpretations of what exactly is Nirvana in this tradition (and what is/is-not a tathagata after death etc), it's perhaps universally accepted by it's adherents that embarking on this doctrine culminates in the permanent cessation of suffering. Some may speculate or say more about Nirvana, but others might be silent and not add anything that the texts don't say. But what about Mahayana's Nirvana? 

It's quite common, actually. I'm absolutely not physically at your side right now. And I'm absolutely not angry, thirsty or sad right now. Rarity is not proof, nor is unlikeliness. For centuries, it was absurd to think that we are in motion, much worse, spinning at the speed of 1600 km/hr, and yet that seems to be the case for us in this planet. It was also absurd that invisible living things exist -- until microscopes were invented. And so on... 

"[...] This also means that this person loses his personhood (although this personhood is impermanent and is part of dukkha)." I wouldn't say "loses". It may be worth reminding that Nirvana should not be considered annihilation. Complementing: 

Where "phenomena" (dhammā) stands as a constituent of experience, something or anything that can be experienced. Now, the Buddha has been asked point blank if there's a self, but he refused to answer: 

"However, in my practice I have found that if I consciously try to relax during a session (muscular tension is an issue with me) it can be a much more fulfilling, refreshing experience." During meditation, specially, the samatha aspect of the practice, that's good. Here's the Buddha describing his own experience: 

It promotes concentration since it narrows the focus of the mind during the meditation practice -- it's not a single meditation object but the focus is still narrow. By resting the mind on specific experiences and making it the main interest of the mind it also helps weaken the hindrances, thus it promotes the stability. 

I see two misunderstandings with his statement. He seems to take a sequential reading of the four noble truths as instructions, where the third would instruct to "remove desire" and the fourth would instruct to "follow the eightfold path". Then he argues that one who removed the desire on the third step, does not need to follow the eightfold path -- hence, it contradicts itself. That reading is alien to buddhists, insofar as we are talking about one who hasn't satisfied the third noble truth (end of dukkha). It has been noted that the four noble truths mirror medical diagnosis: recognizing disease/symptoms (there's dukkha), identifying origin of disease (craving), determining if a cure is possible (there's end of dukkha), and if so, prescribing medicine (the eighfold path). While he may be right that one who has satisfied the third truth no longer needs the training (e.g. an arahant), it doesn't seem to me that this is what he meant. The problem on the core of his argument is that he, as many others, identify "abandoning desire" and "having desire [for nirvana, for buddhahood, for learning dhamma, etc]" as contradictions. The contradiction, however, does not exist. If anything, it tells us a limitation of language and perception, not a limitation of the subject of matter. For example, consider methods like vaccine: generally, a way to introduce a virus to train your immune system. Another way of explaining it would be "something that makes you ill to make you healthy". For another example, consider body workout: generally, a way to improve strength and build muscles. Another way of saying what it is would be "exercises to make your body weak and cause repeated damages to your muscles so you can be stronger and have more muscles". Apparently, these are contradictions. But only in appearance, caused by mixing method and long term goals as if they had the same "semantic status", and while ignoring the process underneath. These examples, thus, tells us a limitation of language and perception, not a limitation of the subject of matter (i.e. it does not debunk workout or vaccine). 

There are two things here that I think are worth to have a clear separation: one is what is recorded of the teachings (and how they are understood), and the other is their significance to the path. Also, notice I'm mainly writing from the point of view of the Pali Canon texts and from a more traditional reading of it. Karma and Rebirth and the Buddha There are many interpretations of what was the Buddha's position on these subjects. Among the ones in that vein are: 

...which is an actual behavioral change, and a very practical benefit. It means that craving is also weakened. "Also my understanding is that Buddhism also sees thought as a sense door so therefore thought also causes these sensations. Is that correct?" Yes, mind is a sense door, thought is a sense object. With the arising of mind-consciousness, the meeting of the three is contact. With that contact as condition, painful, pleasant, or nor-painful-or-pleasant feeling arises. "In order to be a successful practitioner do I need to train myself to notice all these sensations?" If you notice only one and make it your experiment of investigation as above, that's already a success, isn't it? Then, take the next one that comes up. As soon as you are comfortable with making the many incoming stimuli objects of analysis, go ahead. With samatha practices, it becomes easier and very natural to be able to direct the mind to a stream of stimuli, as we become more sensitive to our senses or...well, able to concentrate better. "Is it good enough to just notice some like itching, trembling?" I'd say it's good, but just noticing it's presence without the actual exercises as above is not good enough -- that is, in regard to the practice you are trying to do. "Do I need to understand what causes them?" By the suttas above, it's important to understand the conditions that make them arise, and the how they cease. Thus, we are taught in terms of the sequence of conditions above: consciousness, sense door, sense object, contact, feeling, etc. This is because this is the very foundation that, according to the tradition, makes suffering come to be and makes it cease. Thus, by understanding them, the whole castle of suffering can be made to cease. 

Not that I know of from the sutras. From them, I understand it's generally considered a skill like any other -- which can be highly developed by some. But I understand these are skills that are not particularly encouraged, seen as particularly special, or find a significant place in the buddhist path [when put alongside with the doctrinal concepts and practices]. 

Desires for well being, for good, and further aspirations are not considered "bad", on the contrary. In Buddhism, two technical terms for things we strive to overcome are craving (pali taṇhā) and clinging (pali upādāna). These are specific kinds of desire that present problems. 

Leaving aside that he did not just "suggested some theories", he did emphasize that this is something to be carried out individually by one's own effort. Now, if you think the method he proposes takes out "the beauty of the process", you are naturally free to try out own your own. There's legitimacy in following your own nose, but may I suggest how this may not be as virtuous or effective as one might fantasize? Take calculus: no reasonably intelligent person will try to come up with calculus on their own: they will try to learn what has been developed. It took specific circumstances in the development of science and mathematics and specific characters with a specially strong will to answer specific questions to be able to successfully develop this subject. Disappear with all knowledge post-calculus from earth, and it could take many centuries to rediscover it again -- if that soon. Extinguishing does not require one to figure out everything from scratch. It requires extinguishing it. If some teachings are known to be useful, there's only one reason not to use it: if one wants something else than (for example: to experience some particular kind of beauty in an spiritual process) 

What text are you referring to? Also, what is meant by "flying"? Is it an actual body? Or, perhaps, just the mind? 

"When does one realize, one is ignorant ?" I guess, when one realizes one does not understand / is unskillful in the above. "Can one know nothing of ignorance and still become enlightened?" As far as enlightenment is understood as nirvana (which is understood as cessation of dukkha), and ignorance is understood as the above, no. That would be the same as asking if someone who knows nothing of arithmetic to be able to sum numbers: his sum would denounce the very knowledge of arithmetic. In the same way, someone skillful and wise on origin and cessation of dukkha, someone who put an end on dukkha necessarily is someone who is not an ignorant on the origin and cessation of dukkha. 

Alternatively, one can dedicate meditation sessions to, say, the observation of body and feeling as described in the Satipaṭṭhāna sutta. These practices, as it turns out, help with the weakening of the five hindrances (restlessness, sloth/torpor, sensual desire, aversion and doubt). These hindrances are critical obstacles to overcome. So weakening them should probably be the focus of the practice until one is able to be free from them for some reasonable period of time. So, at this point, all the effort should go into understanding and suppressing the five hindrances. Part of this practice is done in the day to day, part by the practices above, and part by developing concentration (which is also helped by the mindfulness meditation). Much of the practice of meditation at this stage is popularly taught as simply calming and "letting go", but they benefit significantly from the "mindfulness" practices. "From what I understood, each of these practices are clearly differents and even have different pali names (Samatha and Vipassana if I am right ?)." Some traditions and teachers draw a clear distinction between them. Some ignore "concentration" altogether (likely as a shortcut, but sacrificing one branch of the eightfold path; this is a polemical subject), and others teach concentration in a very deep and "absorbed" way and do "vipassana" once they emerge from absorption. A lot of these interpretations come from the exegetical texts, in particular, from the classic book Visuddhimagga -- "Path of Purification". The suttas, however, allow for other readings. For example, in many discourses, right mindfulness is said to precede right concentration:
