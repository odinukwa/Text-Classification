First, remember that low priority to you is not necessarily low priority to them. Cosmetic issues are often extremely important to the people who only see the cosmetic side of things. I would say to discuss your planned schedule with them and be prepared to readjust based on their priorities not yours. Customer priorities should almost always take precedence. 

This is not only useful, it is a golden opportunity to propose change and get it implemented in order to pass the audit. It is very rare to have such an opportunity when change proposals are going to be looked on so favorably. Further, it educates the employees doing the internal audit about the internal controls etc. that are part of a good financial structure. By doing the internal audit, assuming you do it well and not treat it as a joke, the people doing the auditing will have a chance to look at the details of what is happening with their systems and to get very knowledgable about the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) that the audit will likely be based on. One of the most critical things that they may learn is about the importance of internal controls to prevent fraud. It is especially important if the people who are being audited are not professional accountants themselves and thus may not really understand the details of the GAAP. In smaller companies I have seen many places where the people who set up the orginal systems had no concept of internal controls and thus their systems would have been ridiculously easy to steal from. (I should point out that I used to work for a government audit agency so I tend to notice this stuff even though my job no longer includes an auditing component.) Having these people do an internal audit before the financial audit might help them close those gaps before the real auditors show up. I would suggest that the internal team consists of multiple people and that no one internally audit his or her own direct tasks and that all work is reviewed by multiple people. You might even find some actual fraud that way. The one caution I might make is that you do not want to be assigned to do this if management just wants to find ways to "creatively" cover up any problems you find especially any illegalities. Always remember that the alternative term for creative accounting is FRAUD. People who help cover up illegal activites can go to jail with the peope who set up the illegalities in the first place. 

You have a four-week notice period which is more than long enough to turn over your work to someone else. (If it takes more than a week, you are doing something wrong!) If you feel guilty about leaving (which you should not, but people do), then prep for the turnover as much as you can before you turn in your notice. Anytime I have resigned, I turned in a resignation letter, a list of all my projects and where everything is concerning them and what is still left to do and any other pertintent details. And please remember, companies don't feel guilty about laying people off with no notice even when the managers have known it was coming for months. There is nothing unprofessional about not telling until you give notice on your side either. That is what most people do. If you tell them ahead of time, you could get fired on the spot, or shifted to less important and interesting work etc. 

First, you need to talk to them about expectations about timeliness and hours. To arrive late and leave early 90% of the time is inexcusable. It would get someone fired in every job I have ever held. They need to know the behavior cannot continue or they will be fired. Talk to HR about the process of putting someone on on a performance improvement plan. These employees need to be placed in this situation and it needs to be enforced. They will need to provide proof of a train delay any time it is late and they will need to make up all time missed or the time should come out of their annual leave (depending on the legal rules in your jurisdiction.) there needs to be a consequence for this behavior. The reason that I think they need to through a firing process is because they are working part-time for a full-time salary and benefits. In other words they are cheating your company. I wouldn't bother to try to salvage these employees at all. 

While I think I would have fired this person long ago, frankly it is your company that is broken not this one employee. You don't understand how to truly manage people and you are (no surprise here) getting poor results as a result. The single worst way to manage is let people do whatever they want. Start managing. It is not micromanagement to expect results. It is not micromanagement to ask why they are not getting things done and hold people responsible. You should be sitting with a dev who claims to have a blocker and ask him to show you the problem and help him get rid of the blocker or show him a way to solve his problem. You should code review every piece of code they check in and ask questions when nothing is getting checked in for you to code review. It shouldn't be a surprise on Friday if the milestones aren't met. You should above all start requiring they work the hours they are being paid for. No time off unless approved in advance. No working a 4 hour day when they are supposed to be working an 8 hour one espcially if they have to work weekends to make it up. Getting to leave early is for when your work is done, not when you feel like it. You can allow more freedom once they start producing, but underperformers don't get privileges. Period. Ever. You have put the priviledges ahead of the production of work and that is why you are failing. It is why this guy thinks he can do whatever he wants with no negative consequences. You are a manager, you have to start instituting negative consequences. You need to hold people accountable and get rid of people who don't perform. You need to do more than a daily standup where apparently it is ok to say you didn't do anything the day before. Why are you not putting them on the spot when they aren't making progress? You need to have policies, you need to stop this anyone can take any time off they want stuff. You can't possibly plan project milestones in an enviroment like that. You need to hold people responsible for completing milestones and get rid of the slackers. That you are asking people to work weekends because people didn't work very hard during the week is unacceptable. If your current staff members don't understand how to work, then fire them and get some new ones. Get rid of trendy things like open offices and unassigned seating, that is cutting productivity as well. Any emplyee who is unable to make progress while working remotely loses the priviledge. Expect check ins to source control daily and go to the person directly and ask what they are doing when they don't check anything in. Your entire staff are behaving like children and you are letting them. This is a business, you have to start managing it like one, not like some frat house where people come and go at all hours and don't do anything they don't feel like doing. 

While I have seen both good and bad from working frequently with remote workers, I can tell you that it only takes a very few people who abuse the situtation to make management decide to end it. While flexibility is nice to have as a worker, when it starts interfering with the ability of others who need to talk to you to get in touch, then the remote working will go away. I suspect this is what happened at Yahoo. How can you abuse the situtation? First by not being available by email, phone or IM. Yes you may think you are being more productive by turning these things off, but all you are doing is making your coworkers and boss angry. If you are remote and people can't get ahold of you then in their minds you are not working. Next thing I have seen go wrong is the whole, "this makes it easier for me as a mother because I can pick up my kids etc." thing. Unfortunately what tends to happen is the worker is spending all her time watching the kids and not working and production is significantly less than it was when the person was in the office. So the moms who are complaining about Yahoo's new policy are using exactly the wrong arument for a manager to listen to if they have expereinced this in their own remote workers. I don't care if it is easier to take care of your kids, you should NOT be doing that when you are supposed to be working. Period. Of course Moms aren't the only ones who slack off when working at home. It is really easy to get caught up in the tv or games or the Internet (especially since you can have an entirely different computer to play on than the one you are connected to work from) or even housework. I have seen people who were forbidden to work from home whose output doubled or tripled when forced to come into the office. It really doesn't take too many of those people before a manager decides it isn't a great idea. If you like the idea of remote working and you want to keep it where you work then be sure to do the following:
