I feel this question is so broad, it might well be the topic of an interesting book on the history of astronomy, should someone be inclined to write it. :) Anyway, I think a few points could be made briefly. 1. Collecting data In astronomy, that means observing the cosmos. That means using an instrument of some kind, typically a telescope, and gathering information through it. Telescope performance is dictated by many factors, but the most important one is size (or aperture). Telescope size grew rapidly through 1600s and 1700s, from Galileo's 1.5 cm refractor in early 1600s, surpassing the 1 meter aperture in early 1800s - Herschel's 40 foot reflector. There was a steady stream of improvements regularly throughout that 200 year period. One could say that the first golden age of the telescope aperture race both culminated and ended with Herschel and his giant telescopes. Then there was a lull, briefly interrupted by Lord Rosse's 1.83 meter telescope, the Leviathan of Parsonstown, in mid-1800s. Then nothing again. The aperture race was resumed only in early 1900s, with the 2.5 meter reflector on Mt. Wilson, the Hooker telescope. Afterwards, throughout the 20th century, and now in early 21st, the race is going strong, with the 10.4 meter Gran Canarias segmented reflector currently in the lead, and the 39 meter E-ELT reflector being under construction at Cerro Armazones. $URL$ 2. Interpreting data The year 1900 marks the boundary between classic physics and the new physics. After that year, relativity and quantum mechanics took off. This is what enabled the new cosmology to emerge in the 20th century. In other words, with the 1800s science, even with tons of data, there would have been no way to figure out, basically, everything. Supernovas? The expansion of the universe? Dark matter and the rotation of galaxies? This is all based on 20th century physics. 19th century physics would have been clueless. Astronomy used classic physics to derive interpretations from data pretty quickly, and that process had achieved great success already well into the 1700s. That's when the structure of the solar system was figured out, way back to Kepler in the 1600s. Herschel found Uranus in late 1700s. There are some exceptions here. Stellar parallax was detected in early 1800s, which enabled an estimate to nearest stars. Spectroscopy showed that distant stars are made of the same elements like the Earth in the 1850s. Around that same time, Neptune was discovered. So the 1800s was not quite a completely dry period, in terms of theoretical progress. In any case, a limit was reached anyway in late 1800s, because what was needed was new paradigms in physics to give new life to the interpretation process. That boost occurred after 1900, with relativity and quantum mechanics. Cosmology is highly dependent on physics (and vice-versa). 

E.g., this is the size of an object of 1 arcsec angular size, situated at 384,000 km (the orbit of the Moon): $URL$ It's 1.8 km (in case the link above is unavailable). In other words, that's the minimum absolute distance resolved by a telescope 10 cm in aperture, for objects on the Moon. Any two dots closer together than 1.8 km, placed on the Moon, are seen as one dot in a 10 cm telescope. 

EDIT: It's probably beneficial to get a small sky atlas too. Let's say you read in the news that a supernova has been discovered in a nearby galaxy, and it can be seen by amateurs. You could point the scope in its general direction, but you'll need a detailed local map of the region. The one point of light that is seen in the sky but is not seen on the map is the supernova. It also helps when observing other transients such as comets and asteroids (again, they stand out because they are not on the map). Finally, with some smaller DSOs it makes it easier to identify the object from the stellar background (and they should be marked on the map because they are permanent objects). $URL$ You could also use various digital maps on a portable device, but I recommend that you master the paper maps first. Once you own a handful of eyepieces, a barlow, etc, you should keep them together in a carrying box. Many astronomers use a pluck foam case, and they just shape the foam to hold each and every component. I've never used the dividers that come with the case, since optical components are small, lightweight, rather fragile, and should be surrounded only by foam. $URL$ Another item I've found useful is a tiny folding table. It doesn't have to be huge, just big enough to hold a book, the sky atlas, etc. It's better than making a pile of stuff around you on the ground. A cheap, collapsible barstool or something like it would help with long observing sessions. Definitely beats hunching over the scope for hours. Just make sure it's the right height. Big dobsonian owners tend to make or buy so-called observing chairs, which are adjustable, but those are probably overkill for you since your eyepiece doesn't move around that much. Your scope has a geometry similar to my SCT, which doesn't really require a true observing chair, just anything to sit on that's the correct height. Now if you had a big dob then that would be different. A pretty common improvisation is an empty box or frame that's 3 different sizes in all directions (length, width, height). That allows some height adjustment, and it's pretty cheap to procure or make. Between sessions you could use it to store the telescope or something. 

There's quite a few things here that need comments. First off, the "linking" you describe was actually the first definition of the second (day, hour, and all the way down to second). Remember, since the dawn of civilization we've used celestial bodies to keep time for us. The phenomena of the Sun and the Moon had good enough precision for all practical purposes until very recently. It was then that the definition of the time unit was rebased to a different phenomenon. BTW, the second of time is not a physical constant. It is a unit of measure currently defined as a multiple of the frequency coming out of the transitions of a certain atom between two different states. Of course, the motion of the Earth follows its own clock, different from atomic phenomena, so it ought to drift off after a while. Do we "need" to make adjustments then? That's debatable. We still prefer to keep the Earth's clock and our clock in sync, and therefore we make adjustments when necessary. But is it needed in an absolute sense? No, not really. It's just convenient. As to the risk of "upsetting the Internet", this is an alarmist rumor the likes of the "Y2K bug". I actually happen to work in a related field - I've done infrastructure at a variety of tech companies in the Silicon Valley; the NTP infrastructure (Network Time Protocol - what keeps Internet services in time sync) is something I'm very familiar with. A jump of 1 second should be and will be tolerated by essentially everything that's out there now. Will there be stragglers here and there that will hiccup when the time takes a tiny leap? Yes. And that's a bug, the engineers need to look at the software and fix it. Remember, a lot of existing services (like Google Search, or Instagram) have servers and instances right now that are off by more than 1 second (just the way there are cars coming out of the assembly line with missing bolts once in a while), and usually nothing bad happens as long as the drift is not too big); fix NTP, the time base jumps on that instance, and again nothing bad happens in the vast majority of cases. Relax, nothing important will be "upset". In fact, I doubt that the vast majority of people will be affected in any perceivable way. 

The answer provided by @antlersoft is very much on point. Just adding to it: The SW76 is a fun little scope mainly concerned with ease of use. It's a lot simpler to handle than refractors of similar aperture, and it's very robust. If there ever was a child-friendly scope (in a good way), this would be it - but adults can have fun with it too. There might be several different models available? Not sure. I'm seeing reviews saying that it actually comes with two eyepieces, a 15x and a 30x. The 15x would provide a wider view, closer to binoculars. Unfortunately, it uses a proprietary format for the eyepieces, so you can't just buy some commonly available eyepiece and use it. This is my main criticism for an otherwise well-designed instrument. If you're missing the 15x lens, maybe you could find it cheap on eBay? I am the author of the answer you're quoting. Let me rephrase it. DSOs (deep sky objects) or "low brightness" objects are very sensitive to light pollution. If you live in the city, no matter what telescope you use, DSOs will not look that great. They just drown in the ambient light, reflected back down to Earth by the atmosphere. You will see most of the Messier objects (the ones that begin with the letter M, followed by a number) with your instrument, they just don't look super-impressive. E.g. the Orion Nebula (M42) is visible now in the winter months and you'll see it as a little smudge or "cloud" - just google "how to find the orion nebula". You will never see the sky full of stars unless you go far away from the city. In my trips to the Death Valley I've carried binoculars with me, and it's amazing - while in the desert, point the lens in any direction and it's like a river of stars. But a very dark sky is mandatory to see it like this. This might be a little tricky to find in the Old World. There are many light pollution maps online that could help you find good spots. But as a rule of thumb - far away from people and industrial facilities is good. If you could find the 15x lens, your scope would be more or less equivalent to a pair of powerful binoculars, a 15x76 effectively, very similar to what I have (15x70). The 30x would work also, but the field of view would be 2x smaller (you're zooming in with the stronger lens). 

Since it's operating in microgravity, the optics will not deform under their own weight, so you can make them quite thin and lightweight. The instrument will operate under extremes of temperature. You will need some kind of dynamic focusing to compensate for expansion / contraction. Be careful, with some catoptric designs such as Cassegrain you also need to pay attention to the distance from primary mirror to secondary elements, etc. Using carbon fiber for the skeleton would reduce expansion / contraction a great deal, and would also provide excellent stiffness per unit of weight. Quartz mirrors could deal very well with huge temperature variations, but quartz is expensive to process to optical precision. Borosilicate glass (the material used for most amateur telescopes) should also work well; Supremax 33 for example is cheap and fairly good. It depends on the optician who will make the mirrors. If you find someone who could give a discount on quartz, go for it; otherwise use borosilicate and don't worry about it. You will also need some kind of inertial elements to change the orientation of the telescope in space. That's not a trivial task.
