It is unnecessary. Praxeology: The Methodology of Austrian Economics by Murray N. Rothbard ...Moreover, even if verbal economics could be successfully translated into mathematical symbols and then translated into English so as to explain the conclusions, the process makes no sense and violates the great scientific principle of Occam’s Razor: avoiding unnecessary multiplication of entities… ...Although himself a mathematical economist, the mathematician son of Carl Menger wrote a trenchant critique of the idea that mathematical presentation in economics is necessarily more precise than ordinary language: Consider, for example, the statements (2) To a higher price of a good, there corresponds a lower (or at any rate not a higher) demand. (2') If p denotes the price of, and q the demand for, a good, then q = f(p) and dq/dp = f' (p) ≤ 0 Those who regard the formula (2') as more precise or "more mathematical" than the sentence (2) are under a complete misapprehension … the only difference between (2) and (2') is this: since (2') is limited to functions which are differentiable and whose graphs, therefore, have tangents (which from an economic point of view are not more plausible than curvature), the sentence (2) is more general, but it is by no means less precise: it is of the same mathematical precision as (2'). Mathematics versus Economic Logic by Ludwig von Mises ...The deliberations which result in the formulation of an equation are necessarily of a nonmathematical character. The formulation of the equation is the consummation of our knowledge; it does not directly enlarge our knowledge. […] No such constant relations exist, however, between economic elements. The equations formulated by mathematical economics remain a useless piece of mental gymnastics and would remain so even it they were to express much more than they really do. ...The mathematical method is at a loss to show how, from a state of nonequilibrium, those actions spring up which tend toward the establishment of equilibrium. It is, of course, possible to indicate the mathematical operations required for the transformation of the mathematical description of a definite state of nonequilibrium into the mathematical description of the state of equilibrium. But these mathematical operations by no means describe the market process actuated by the discrepancies in the price structure. The differential equations of mechanics are supposed to describe precisely the motions concerned at any instant of the time traveled through. The economic equations have no reference whatever to conditions as they really are in each instant of the time interval between the state of nonequilibrium and that of equilibrium. Only those entirely blinded by the prepossession that economics must be a pale replica of mechanics will underrate the weight of this objection. A very imperfect and superficial metaphor is not a substitute for the services rendered by logical economics... 

if you have no training, trying to rescue a drowning person with no equipment in deep water is actually dangerous. they aren't thinking straight and may drown you. but let's assume rescuing them is only a tiny risk. then go ahead. life is full of risks. if you ride in a car you could die in a car crash. trying to avoid all risk would be silly. you don't need a big benefit to accept a tiny risk. it's up to you if you want to rescue them. if you value human life, then that's a reason to do it since you want to see the guy healthy. if you like people in general, and you have a way to be a big help to someone at a low cost, then you can do it, go ahead. there's nothing in Objectivism to outlaw this (nor strictly mandate it. but Objectivists respect human life. so if it's a tiny cost, well, can't you afford it? Objectivists ought to be productive and be able to afford tiny costs to promote their values.). it's great to look for opportunities to trade mutual benefit in general. if you had more time maybe you'd ask him to pay you $10 to help. but you're in a hurry. you could ask him afterwards. i bet he'd give you $10 if you really care, or perhaps he'll volunteer some other reward for you. but $10 is so small compared to a life that it's not a big concern here, nor is the $10 of effort and risk this cost you. (it depends on the scenario parameters. if it costs you $5000 of effort and risk, then that could harm your own life, and he might not pay you back after you save him, so you have to consider what you want to do.) 

This kind of rhetoric formulations is just a misleading fallacy. Verbs needing a subject is only human reason about acting over an object. Nothing is an ideal representation of the lack of existence, as the number zero. An action requires an object. The action lacks of sense without an object. Can you cut nothing? Can you wash nothing? Can you plant zero seeds? Not possible. Imagining nothing has no logic as well. 

There's no point in time where bacteria, or apes, or neanderthals, or summerians switched to a behavior under the rules of morals. Morals are a set of informal and non-coercitive rules that allow individuals in a society to live together. In other words, we can survive as a group only due to morals. Ethics are the same, but formalized and non-coercitive. Law is the same, but formalized and coercitive. Therefore, we can say that bees follow a social behavior that would be comparable to the one determined by morals in the sense that it allows the group to survive. Bees bring resources to the nest for all individuals, and their primary source of food aren't other members of the group. Just as we do, while we call it morals. Then, morals, ethics or law are just sets of rules promoting group existence and persistence. They are a foundational aspect of the features of the human species that evolved and persisted natural selection. Animals or plants would have equivalent features. 

the arguments against Objectivism are mostly from people who don't understand Objectivism. but an actual issue with Objectivism is induction. induction has logical problems as explained by Karl Popper and many others. Rand knew that she couldn't explain how induction worked and defend it in detail, but she still mistakenly assumed that it works somehow. 

there's mysticism here. a simulation of a human is a human. it's the same thing. human minds are software running in a classical computer. that's what you already are – a computer running software. the hardware details don't matter to the computations. no soul or organic molecules required. an intelligence software program has to do certain things. included on the list is create knowledge. the only known knowledge-creating process is evolution. knowledge can be created through replication with variation and selection. (in the case of ideas this would more normally be called brainstorming and critical thinking to eliminate errors). software that does this within various parameters, and does a few other things, would be a thinking person. that's all there is to it. stuff like emotions are emergent properties of software, they aren't tied to souls, hardware made of organic molecules instead of silicon, etc 

no. individuals face problems like how to live their life and stay alive. this leads to various problems (like getting food and shelter) and solutions. this process of problem solving requires thinking. the thinking should be done in certain ways and not other ways, like it should be non-contradictory. overall what you say doesn't really have much to do with Objectivism's perspective. 

Why 1+1 => 2? Because if you put an apple in an empty bag, then add another, and you count the apples, you will find two apples. The same happens if you-hit-your-head-against-the-wall => you-feel-pain. This mechanism of action and reaction is called causality. We learn the action-reaction mechanism before being born and along all our lives. When something breaks causality, we feel pain, anguish, fear. Imagine you bash your head against the wall, but you don't feel nothing. Imagine you lose a loving one. Imagine you see an UFO or a miracle. All this events break the causality rules in our head and we lose the sense of reality. The only reality we accept is the one we understand, and that is the one which follows the causality mechanism. A proof is the application of the causal rule over a system. 

I'm a writer working on the theory of systems, therefore you can consider this as an opinion. The definition of existence is essential here. Existence is relative, not absolute (see George Berkeley). Therefore, closed systems (systems without inputs and outputs to interact) don't exist for us because we cannot know about them, because we cannot interact with them [1]. Things (systems) exist as long as we can interact with them. Or formally, an object system exists for a subject system as long as it is able to interact with it. Therefore, if the earth has a second moon but we are unable to interact with it (see, measure, detect it in some way), it doesn't exist. Existence is not proper to life or reason, but to systems interaction (you can see my interaction theory draft on ydor.org). Therefore, if a tree falls in a forest, and there's no one to hear the sound it produces, there is no sound. You can say that air vibrations existed anyway for entities around the tree, yes. But what if it felt down very, very slowly? Are stones deciding if the vibration can be considered as a sound? Imagine you are present there: it is you who will decide if any sound is produced. Well (the opposite), you don't need to be there. You can listen from home, and if you listen the noise of a falling tree on the distant forest, you can say it existed. If not, it didn't. Therefore, it is your brain who decides if something exists. In this case the existence you ask about is a concept, which is limited by your knowledge. Does John Johnson living in Abbey Road exist? Well, look at the phone index to know. But finding him doesn't mean he exists. You should be able to interact with him. If not, there's always the possibility he would be dead two seconds ago. We usually trust the rest of people, that's another way of interacting with distant people. Does Mick Jagger or Beethoven exist? As long as you interact with them (listen to a record and react in consequence, or see them on tv), they exist for you, even if one of them is dead. Jagger can have died two seconds ago, but he would still exists for almost all mankind anyway. Beethoven can be alive, there are no zero probabilities. Again, existence is relative. Systems exist for other systems if they interact. You can be one of those systems or not. 

Sure. None have been successful though. 1 He who wants to attack a praxeological theorem has to trace it back, step by step, until he reaches a point in which, in the chain of reasoning that resulted in the theorem concerned, a logical error can be unmasked. But if this regressive process of deduction ends at the category of action without having discovered a vicious link in the chain of reasoning, the theorem is fully confirmed. Those positivists who reject such a theorem without having subjected it to this examination are no less foolish than those seventeenth-century astronomers were who refused to look through the telescope that would have shown them that Galileo was right and they were wrong. — Ludwig von Mises, Ultimate Foundation of Economic Science, p.70 2 "The essence of logical positivism is to deny the cognitive value of a priori knowledge by pointing out that all a priori propositions are merely analytic. They do not provide new information, but are merely verbal or tautological, asserting what has already been implied in the definitions and premises. Only experience can lead to synthetic propositions. There is an obvious objection against this doctrine, viz., that this proposition that there are no synthetic a priori propositions is in itself —as the present writer thinks, false— a synthetic a priori proposition, for it can manifestly not be established by experience." — Ludwig von Mises, The Ultimate Foundation of Economic Science, pg. 5 3 “The attempt to disprove the action-axiom would itself be an action aimed at a goal, requiring means, excluding other courses of action, incurring costs, subjecting the actor to the possibility of achieving or not achieving the desired goal and so leading to a profit or a loss. And the very possession of such knowledge then can never be disputed, and the validity of these concepts can never be falsified by any contingent experience, for disputing or falsifying anything would already have presupposed their very existence. As a matter of fact, a situation in which these categories of action would cease to have a real existence could itself never be observed, for making an observation, too, is an action.” — Hans-Hermann Hoppe, Economic Science and the Austrian Method 

When we work, we give something and receive something. When we love, the exact same thing happens. When we buy an apple, the exact same thing happens. Such exchanges of something are called interactions. You can take a look to references and my draft of a theory of interaction on $URL$ It would be related to the theory of systems. When two entities interact, each one can get a positive or negative benefit. Win-win is one of nature's amazing phenomenon. Under normal conditions, job/work is a win/win exchange. Your brother wins money, his clients win some service/product. Win/win exchanges end up in interactions being repeated. The big problem regarding to earning money raises on win/lose situations. Win/lose is also a common result, which is perfectly achievable and positive on the short term (you can steal ONE wallet an perhaps pass unnoticed). The problem becomes on the long term: win/lose cause interactions to cease repeating. On simple words, your brother can get temporary high benefits from some clients which end up losing, but soon he will lose all chances to continue interacting with any other clients. And here's the point to your question: your brother future commercial interaction trends depend on his focusing: to give (tends to win/win) or to receive (tends to win/lose). Imagine he's a doctor. Focusing on receiving will cause him to use less resources on healing (patients lose) in order to earn more (he wins). Focusing on giving will cause him to use the best resources on healing, despite minor earnings. When someone focuses on giving, the possibilities of a win/win outcome grow exponentially. When focusing on receiving, win/lose is sure to happen. Clients will lose, but on the long term, your brother will lose all clients, and harm definitely his reputation. That means that working for money, in addition to be a waste of time, causes a social damage and leads to poverty on the long term. On the other hand, working to help the others, making minor initial earnings is the natural right way of making long-term big earnings. The practical difference lies on the intention: to help himself or the others. It is not a philosophical approach, but an economical behavior. The "giving" approach seems also ecological, since it is just an imitation of the behavior of natural entities. The only way to make big money with permanent easy earnings is to cheat people and switch quickly to another type of business and habitats, repeating the process constantly, which is moreover the common approach of making big money (drug trafficking, pyramidal schemes, etc.). But usually this leads to heavy legal issues on the mid-term, and a possibly a big frustration, since the person cannot develop itself, but live fleeing formal and informal justice. 

"The whole controversy is, however, meaningless when applied to praxeology. It refers essentially to geometry. Its present state, especially its treatment by logical positivism, has been deeply influenced by the shock that Western philosophy received from the discovery of non-Euclidian geometries. Before Bolyai and Lobachevsky, geometry was, in the eyes of the philosophers, the paragon of perfect science; it was assumed that it provided unshakable certainty forever and for everybody. To proceed also in other branches of knowledge more geometrico was the great ideal of truth-seekers. All traditional epistemological concepts began to totter when the attempts to construct non-Euclidian geometries succeeded. Yet praxeology is not geometry. It is the worst of all superstitions to assume that the epistemological characteristics of one branch of knowledge must necessarily be applicable to any other branch. In dealing with the epistemology of the sciences of human action, one must not take one’s cue from geometry, mechanics, or any other science. The assumptions of Euclid were once considered as self-evidently true. Present-day epistemology looks upon them as freely chosen postulates, the starting point of a hypothetical chain of reasoning. Whatever this may mean, it has no reference at all to the problems of praxeology. The starting point of praxeology is a self-evident truth, the cognition of action, that is, the cognition of the fact that there is such a thing as consciously aiming at ends. There is no use cavilling about these words by referring to philosophical problems that have no bearing upon our problem. The truth of this cognition is as self-evident and as indispensable for the human mind as is the distinction between A and non-A.” — Ludwig von Mises, The Ultimate Foundation of Economic Science, p.5 

Socialism destroys wealth. That's bad for everyone. See $URL$ and $URL$ and $URL$ Objectivists want to produce wealth for themselves, not take it from richer people. Objectivism values productivity and opposes taking the unearned by force. Socialism is collectivist. Objectivist is individualist. 

What objective criteria can be used to judge philosophical refutations? Say for example that someone is writing a criticism of Karl Popper. What are ways to reject the criticism without getting into a detailed debate of the sort that this site doesn't allow? 

government should protect everyone, not just the weak. it should treat everyone equally instead of define a privileged class (e.g. those deemed "weak" by some criterion). the point of government is to protect men from force and keep that defensive force organized and careful instead of just a bunch of chaotic vigilante justice. defense against force (e.g. robbery or enslavement) is an important value for everyone (strong or weak). a hard part is who pays for this defense, and how much from each person? ideally funding would be voluntary. currently that isn't figured out yet. 

what else? the broader goal is to seek out criticisms of Popper, Rand and others that don't suck, and define some criteria for "don't suck" that will be acceptable on this site. 

No empirical falsification is ever decisive whether the theory is probabilistic or not. Popper discussed this, e.g. section 29 of LScD "THE RELATIVITY OF BASIC STATEMENTS". the basic issue, also known as the duhem-quine problem, is whenever you have a refutation either the refuted theory is wrong OR the refutation itself could be wrong, so it's never totally clear, decisive and settled. So what do you do instead? You criticize and stop seeking certainty. You try to find bad ideas and reject them. Does it makes sense? Any logical issues? Does it solve the problem it's supposed to solve? Does it cause any problems? You look for good qualities for ideas and things wrong with them. Do your best to think and improve your ideas. Grow your knowledge instead of yearning for final unquestionable answers. This works the same with probabilistic and non-probabilistic theories.
