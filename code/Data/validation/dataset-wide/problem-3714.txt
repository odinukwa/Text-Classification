What are your goals? Do you have any goals? Goals should be a major part of any workout plan. Whether you want to be a world class athlete, compete well in a local event, improve stamina, lose some weight or maintain an energy level the lack of a goal can make working out a mental challenge. If you have an athletic induced goal and you're stuttering to workout, post your goals somewhere to jump start you, be in on the inside of your bedroom door, your desk at work/school or in the car. If you do not have any try to find additional motivation to work out. 

There are a couple of things you need to ask yourself before you can get a solid answer. How much time do you want to/do you have to commit to the running training? If you only have 4 days, I'd suggest running on the days that you do not lift as mentioned above. If you want some overlap (to provide you with a recovery day) my philosophy has always been to lift after running. If you run fresh you may have different form if you just recently completed exercise of a different fashion. Running tired or fatigued (especially if you lift with your legs) can cause tightness, which can alter form or gait. If you want to train its best to keep good form for injury and muscle memory reasons. IF you have to lift first thing in the day, I'd reco waiting until the late day to run if possible. Then again if you believe you are not prone to injury and do not want to sacrifice lifting form from possible fatigue from running feel free to switch. If, however, you decide to do hard running workouts (tempo runs, track workouts, I'd really reco you lift afterwards) 

Does anyone know how to reduce one's sweat rate? Currently I lose about 3lbs of sweat an hour when I run, even on mild days where the temp. is around 60-70 degrees. As I'm training for ultras, I'd like to reduce that rate if possible. I believe I can take electrolyte pills, but unaware how effective they are and how they impact sweat rate. UPDATE: Someone mentioned that electrolyte tablets can reduce the amount of sweat you lose during exercise. Is this true or do those only help you keep your sodium levels up? 

The big thing to ensure you do in this situation is to 1) ensure you are in properly fitted shoes and 2) have good bio-mechanics. If you do these, you can run on almost any terrain (concrete if the exception. Concrete is always a bit rough due to its density). To give you an idea, I've run on asphalt roughly 75% of my miles over the past 7 years with weekly mileage totals going over 100 miles/week. If you do the daily running maintenance, asphalt can be ok. This includes: 

To add to the two previous answers alerady... Hydration as a WHOLE needs to be addressed more so than the hydration one understakes right before running. One should be adaquately hydrated in general. You do dehydrate as you sleep though through breathing (especially in the winter when the air can be dry) and sweat. You could also drink a less amount of water (24oz. is a lot IMO) as you wake up. You should give yourself a few minutes to stretch, losen up and wake up before heading out the door anyway, so I'd reco keeping a glass on your nightstand to drink the moment you wake up in the morning. You don't need the entire 24oz, a simple 4-8oz will do quite a bit I believe. I tend to keep a glass of water on my nightstand and, anytime I wake up in the night, I grab it for a quick drink. Lastly if your body needs a lot of hydration you could always drink water DURING your run. If you are running a marathon you shoudl practice drinking during the run. These early morning runs can be a great time to do so if you must hydrate a lot for any run. 

I believe this is dehydration and/or exhaustion. There are multiple message boards and online forums where people conclude this. Here is just one example I too have experienced this MULTIPLE times, usually after extremely hard workouts or prolonged endurance events. I've done multiple 24-hour ski races where I never stop during the 24-hours. I end up staying awake for close to 40 hours and by the end I am too exhausted to maintain body temperature. My two fastest marathons resulted in the same thing. I was as healthy as I could possibly be before, during and after the marathon (my results in the race prove that) but I was feverish for a few hours later in the day). I've since discovered I was never hydrating enough during my marathons and concluding I was overly dehydrated at the end of each one. Couple of things to try: 

Few things: Stay hydrated, but don't over hydrate. Staying hydrated will reduce muscle tightness (a little), which will help reduce the risk of injury. STRETCH. You don't have to go crazy and different methods work for different people. Some people get away with no stretching but I've never seen anyone from getting hurt as a result of stretching (provided it was done correctly). You can get hurt by not stretching. Old coach saying - you can increase intensity or volume, but not both at the same time. If you decide you want to run faster, don't add too much mileage to your weekly total. Don't increase your weekly mileage more than 10%. Obviously there is a grace period for starting up, otherwise to start at a mile would take forever to get anywhere! Let's say you end up running 20 miles a week. Don't take large steps in total weekly mileage - like to 30, unless you have already run that much. Soft surfaces help but not required. Lose gravel (on dirt roads) can actually cause problems so be careful. Get a pair of running shoes that 'fit'. These need to fit differently than your regular shoes. You need a pair that fits your running gait ad stride, not just the size of your foot. Find a local running store that does a gait analysis. I believe all stores do this for free these days, I've yet to see one that charges. One of the things they train their staff on is how to identify the right shoe for the runner in question. Let them tell you what models you are safest in. Have fun! 

Another method is the Oregon system. I followed the Jack Daniels system in college and the Oregon system after college. I had much more success with the Oregon system. Many have success with Jack Daniels, other's not. The important thing is that there is no magical way, everyone is different. A simple summary of what I might do with Oregon might be this 3-week rotation: (I'm skipping easy days and long runs, only noting intervals/tempos) Week 1 Tue - 5 x mile. Last one 25 seconds faster than first Thur - 6 mile tempo in AM. Optional 8x200 in PM Week 2 Tue - 6-8 x 800. Every odd one is even paced. Every even one has first lap at same pace as odd, second lap 5-10 seconds faster. Thur - 1 hour hard tempo PM optional - 6 x 400 Week 3 Tue - 10 x 500. Each set of two slightly faster Thur - optional am run. PM - 6-8 X 30/40 (run 200m in 30 seconds, jog 200 in 40) or 50/20 (run 300 in 50, jog 100 in 20). Vary pace according to ability A great reference on the Oregon system can be found in "The Competitive Runner's Training Book" by Bill Dillinger Competitive Runner's Training Book 

Something to consider for others who might read this post: If you are a runner and training to run a long race (marathon or the sort) and you know the race will be in the morning, it might make sense to do a lot of runs in the morning. Ideally you run about the same time you race for two reasons: 1) Getting used to running that time of day can be important. It'll be good to get your body/mind used to running hard in the AM if you are not used to it. 2) Bathroom habits can be training/learned. If you get up and run each day at the same time you can eventually 'learn' to go to the bathroom before your run. Could save you a few minutes race day if you have already taken a 'pit stop' before the race is underway. This can also be applied to multi-day running. If you will race through the night, it will be wise to train your body (and know what it feels like) to run at 'weird hours'. Otherwise I agree with the above, as long as you have good time for recovery, anytime will suffice for training. 

There are two answers to that question, possibly three. The answer depends on 1) how much you run in a week/month and 2) how hard you run. Conventional wisdom says you should replace your shoes every 400-500 miles. However, if you are only running 10 miles a week, that will mean your shoes will last a year. The foam itself starts to break down and lose its firmness over time. A year should be OK, but if you run say, 100 miles a year, I would not wait 5 years until you replace the shoe. I would, at a minimum, replace a pair of shoes every two years if the mileage is very low. Or the liberal side if you run very fast you can have have unusual wear patterns. I've seen many people having to replace shoes after 300 miles if the weekly mileage is around 100 miles a week. This is probably unlikely for most people but still something to consider. Thus, good rule of thumb is 400-500 miles or 2 years, which ever comes first. 

YES, pool running is great if you are hurt. Kevin Sullivan (Canadian Olympic Miler) is proof that you can come out of the pool and make the Olympic team a matter of weeks later if you stick to a good plan (keep in mind he was already in great shape going into the pool). A good read (with better reads through the links on the page) can be found here: $URL$ Linking to this page: $URL$ Shows the workout he used at the time. To summarize for those who don't want to read the entire article the workout is as follows: HARD/EASY 5 minutes/2.5 minutes 4 minutes/2 minutes (times 2) 3 minutes/1.5 minutes (times 3) 2 minutes/1 minute (times 4) 1 minute/30 seconds (times 5) 30 seconds/15 seconds (times 6) 15 seconds/10 seconds (times 7) I actually used to use that workout when I was hurt for a 2-month period once. My ramp-up time to running strong was much shorter than previous injury periods where I spent no time in the pool doing aqua-jogging. Just remember, it is hard to gauge effort so you are your own gauge of how hard you want to go. If you think you are maxed out, go harder. However, if you are in pain with the aqua-jogging, it might not be a good idea to pursue this. Still, routine aqua-jogging can be a good replacement workout if you are hurt. I would reco you do hard workouts according the schedule you would normally do your hard running workouts on land. For example, if you run hard 3 times a week I'd do pool-sprinting 3 times a week. 

Nathan makes some amazing hydration products that are specialized for distance running. I found the Minimist to be the best of their camleback-like products. It only weight 6.5 oz when dry, holds 50oz of liquid and has enough pockets for fuel for a 4 hour run. The cavity that holds the bladder is a bit bigger than the bladder and you can use that space to put extra fuel in it. The pocket in the front is also big enough to slip an iphone into it if you like music. I've used this on many runs and found it to be the best over my camelbacks. It does not hang very much on your shoulders as the weight is distributed through the use of the side straps. They also make some of the water-bottle holders as well. If you are going to carry a water bottle, I reco getting one that has a least a small pocket on it. This will allow you to carry a gel or a small amount of fuel as well.
