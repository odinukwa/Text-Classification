Let's consider one aspect of the fight against Britain; airpower. The Germans lost something like 1887 planes in the Battle of Britain. At the very least, most of those aircraft could have been saved by the Germans' not fighting in the Battle of Britain. Japan's Admiral Yamamoto once valued the materials used to create the battleship Yamato as equivalent to that of 2000 bombers. By this measure, building the two (smaller) superbattleships Bismarck and Tirpitz cost the Germans something like 2500 bombers. And, of course, they were directed only against Britain. The above numbers compare to the 2800 aircraft (the crucial arm) with which the Germans undertook Operation Barbarossa. The Germans could have undertaken Barbarossa with more than twice as many planes as they actually did. Some of these extra planes (and the accompanying fuel savings) could have been used in "strategic bombing" of Soviet factories and oilfields. So yes, minimizing the war with Britain could have made a large (favorable) difference for Germany in the East. You can decide for yourself what the impact of that extra airpower could have been.

It's true that slavery and indentured servitude were somewhat competitive, but it was NOT true that slavery was always preferred to indentured servitude. One major exception was the establishment of Georgia, by James Oglethorpe. It was founded on the indentured servitude of British prisoners (usually debtors), but Oglethorpe was actually against slavery. So indentured servitude in this case was aimed at the lowest classes of English society. Ultimately, slavery did not put an end to indentured servitude, because slavery was directed at African-American people, while indentured servitude was directed by Englishmen at fellow Englishmen. Slavery remained in America long after English rule was driven out of the 13 Colonies by the American Revolution, bringing about an end to indentured servitude. As Pieter Geerkins pointed out, indentured servitude arguably did not end in North America until 1975, 110 years after slavery ended. 

In 1859, Charles Darwin published "Origin of Species," which postulated a world of "survival of the fittest," in which animals, at least, had to "eat or be eaten." That is, nothing lived in isolation, but rather in a Hobbesian world of "all against all." Coincidentally. or not, international relations of the late 19th century assumed that kind of flavor, whereby whole COUNTRIES had to be colonizers or colonized. Faced with this choice, Japan elected to be a "colonizer," with relatively easy targets nearby in Asia, including Korea, Formosa (now Taiwan), China, and Indochina. The "gun was pointed" at Japan when America's Admiral Perry stopped by in 1854 and pulled Japan into what was then the "modern" world. 

I'll address the question's significance at two levels, the actual (North-South) Civil War, and the one that the Mississippi might have engendered between East and West, Running north to south, the Mississippi was the vehicle by which the North was slowly, but surely winning the Civil War by 1863. The North didn't get an advantage over the South in Virginia until late 1864, but the North was already winning in the west by capturing Memphis, Tennesse and New Orleans, LA. in 1862. The capture of Vicksburg, Mississippi in July 1863 gave the Union control of the whole Missississippi River, and separated the three states west of the the river, Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas, plus Tennessee and Mississippi from the remaining six states of the Conferderacy. Sherman' "March to the Sea" (from Atlanta to Savannah, GA) chopped off the states of Georgia, Alabama, and Florida from Virginia and the Carolinas, by the end of 1864. Hence the South had no choice but to surrender early in 1865. The Mississippi could also have subdivided the U.S. East and West, possibly causing a Civil War that way. Some 60% of the U.S population today lives East of the river, and the remaining 40% to the West. With the notable exception of Texas, and the Pacific states, (Silicon Valley, CA, Boeing and Microsoft in Seattle, Washington), most of the industry is in the East, while the West is largely agricultural. As President, Thomas Jefferson had the fear that his Louisiana Purchase states, and the ones just east of the Mississippi would form a separate country from the 13 colonies east of the Appalachians (now 16, counting the split up states of Vermont, Maine, and West Virginia, 17 if you include Florida.) In his time the West did not include Texas, California, the states between them, or the Pacific northwest. 

She was talking about computers, and it would likely be in the early 1980s when "personal" computers became popular. 

"Prisoners" fall into two categories. The first is military men court-martialed for cowardice, or other offenses, that are given a chance to redeem themselves. The second is criminals sent to war. The first kind of prisoners were quite common particularly in totalitarian societies such as Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union (e.g. in World War II). The second type was less common, but used from time to time. By definition, criminals are aggressive people suited to fighting, and who need a chance to redeem themselves. Sometimes the "amnesty" was offered before the criminals were caught. The British (and other countries) did this in the 17th and 18th century with pirates. Provided that they agreed not to attack ships of their own country, such people were given letters of pardon that immunized them from punishment for attacking the ships of OTHER countries. That process turned "pirates" into "privateers." 

Sectionalism was in fact a major element of the civil war. At the risk of oversimplifying, the strongest conflict was between the Northeastern industrial states (New England, New York, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey), and the "South,"( basically the 11 states that made up the Confederacy). In addition, there were two other sections: the Midwest, and border states such as Maryland, Delaware, Kentucky, and Missouri. President Thomas Jefferson (a Virginian), feared that the Midwestern states (and "Middle South: states such as Tennessee and Mississippi), might try to break away from the 13 colonies and form a connection, either among themselves, along the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, or with British Canada over the Great Lakes, and down the St. Lawrence River. That's why he was so eager to purchase New Orleans to mollify them. (He actually made the "Louisiana" purchase.) Other Southerners initially felt that the "agricultural" (food-producing) Midwest would find common cause with the "agricultural" (cash crop) South against Northeastern industrial and banking interests. In this regard, the Mississippi River might unite the Midwest and South, against the Northeast. But the building of the Erie canal connecting the Great Lakes and the Hudson River pushed the Midwest agricultural trade to the Northeast. The Midwesterners found that Northeasterners needed more (and paid better for) their wheat than the South, which preferred its own corn. Also, Northeastern woolens suited the cold climate Midwest better than Southern cotton (in the days before central heating). And Midwesterners felt that southern slave (and cash crop) agriculture undercut their (food) farming practices, and therefore considered the South competitive with, rather than complementary to themselves. Hence, the Midwest ultimately sided with the Northeast in the Civil War. The rift between slave and free agriculture was particularly acute in the border states, e.g. in Missouri, and in Maryland between the pro-union Piedmont and the pro-slavery Tidewater regions. Most of the above mentioned border states had mini "civil wars" that were resolved in favor of the North. West Virginia "seceded from secession" (Confederate Virginia) and joined the North. In the end, three regions, the Northeast, Midwest, and border states, plus the isolated western states of California and Oregon joined together and "ganged up" against the 11 Confederate states, thereby giving the civil war its character.
