Suppose I gave an good answer or a bad answer in both cases you do not get close to the reality because you will just believe me or not. Buddhism teaches you not to believe any thing you heard just observe yourself, Focus on sensations because higher class intellect is the only thing which differs humans from animals, So be wise and see yourself through vipassana and learn Dharma. We only ask this question when one is feeling negative sensation, Suppose you are ecstatic you would not ask this question, Why or what is life. Buddha said "when you realize the truth(how perfect is everything) you will tilt your head to the sky and laugh at it" 

Lord Buddha have access to unlimited knowledge, This information can be found in old Indian scriptures as well, that human body is capable to visiting to another planets with his/her Astral body (Suksham Sharir). Is there some particular way or do i need Guru for this particular thing ? Many Buddhist monk don't teach this, i am aware that Lord buddha himself have denied not to show any super powers. These Siddhi's (powers) may lead to Ego, But going in universe have always been an interesting thing for anyone. 

Advaita Philosophy was popularized by Acharya Shankara , who succeeded in convincing Indian Buddhists , that Buddhism is a branch of Hinduism.You may refer to the book " Shankara Digvijay--traditional life of Shankaracharya" ,written by Madhava-Vidyaranya ,published by the Ramakrishna Math , Chennai ( Madras) , India and available at Ramakrishna Mission Centres.Shankaracharya lived in the second half of Seventh Century AD (aroud 650 to 690 AD ).He succeeded in convincing Indian Buddhists , that Buddhism was a branch of Hinduism and succeeded in integrating Buddhism to Hinduism. Shankara also portrayed the Buddha as the Ninth Incarnation of Vishnu . Those Buddhists , who did not integrate with Hinduism ,were later (around Tenth Century AD) , slaughtered or converted to Islam by force , by the Muslim Invaders. Shankara's Philosophy is known as Advaita Vedanta Philosophy. But over the years ,it has undergone many modifications , by different preachers ,trying to popularise the idea in their own ways. Latest attempt at popularisation of Advaita Vedanta ,was by Swami Vivekananda (1863-1902) ,who also founded the Ramakrishna Mission. Hinduism has many Books of knowledge ---the Vedas ,the Upanishads ans the Six Schools of Philsophies. The Vedas popularise worshiping different powers of Nature --like the Earth ,Sun ,Air ,Fire ,Lightening ,Sky etc. symbolised as Gods. Upanishads are philosophies of Individual Teachers -who tried to popularize the concept of One God --Creator ,Sustainer and Destroyer of the Universe .They also tried to integrate Individual Consciousness to Universal Consciouness and to Space and Time--assuming the existence of a set of Universal Laws. The Six Philosophical schools ,attempt to integrate the ideas of Upanishads , into a self consistent logical system. They are --(1)Shaankhya (2) Yoga (3) Nyaya (4) Vaisheshika (5) Purva Mimansa (6) Uttara Mimansa (Vedanta).Advaita Vedanta has evolved out of Vedanta . Literally Advaita means Not Two-ordinarily accepted as One or Zero.So the Universal God , can be One or Zero( Shunya or Space).In this philosophy , Existence and Non-Existence , are treated as two sides of the same coin.It assumes three sates of consciousness -waking , sleeping (dreaming) and deep sleep (unconsciousness ,coma or memory less)--all to be TRUE . And tries to INTEGRATE them to a SUPER_CONSCIOUS state--called the Ultimate Reality. For a beginner, trying to understand Advaita Vedanta and its links to Buddhist philosophies ( or Tantra) , I would suggest going through the works of Swami Vivekananda. 

So your question is "" which means sacrifice, renowned and non attachment will bring Salvation. Nothing like anything is never said by Buddha. However coming back to question first of all Lord Buddha's view on salvation is a bit tricky if you are coming from a Hindu background, by that I mean you are not supposed to sacrifice anything just remain in the middle, as Lord Krishna also said remain in tranquility or there should be equanimity in life. As the question has been asked on Buddhism, So lets stick with buddha's view. So the aim to be always remain conscious, which seems to be impossible but with practice you will start realizing that you are doing better. Sit silently and start by focusing on breath, just observe your breath for 3 minutes in starting and do this at least three to six times a day, which should be easy you are android developer. Now also try to use 30 second rule multiple times a day, which in short is to try to remain in the present moment. Now lets say you feel good in meditation and at some point bad, Buddhism approach is that you will not get flown by mind in either of the above said situation, do not get excited when feeling good and do not feel depressed on feeling bad, just OBSERVE. OBSERVATION is very powerful 

The main objective of Vipassana Meditation is to acquire.. Universal Consciousness ,Transcending Body Consciousness. Too much Psychological Stress or Physical suffering ,create STRONG BODY CONSCIOUSNESS . Too much pleasure creates ATTACHMENT TO THE BODY . The Buddha , therefore suggested the MIDDLE PATH ,for OPTIMAL PHYSICAL AND SPIRITUAL DEVELOPMENT. However , in modern day situation ,working under HIGH STRESS and PHYSICAL PAIN , is quite COMMON. I believe , the spread of Christian Philosophy , is partly responsible for this. Christianity was taught to people living in Extreme Poverty .Live One Day at a time and leave the Future in the Hands of God , is the central teaching of Christianity . Buddhism , on the other hand , was taught mainly to The Rich and Princely classes (NOBILITY), who did not have to worry about their day to day Existence. Buddhist teaching , therefore, is centered around Future Planning. ..Christianity rejects or ignores Future Planning. Christianity believes in a Human, Father like God , who takes care of your Future.... Buddhism , on the other hand believes in a set of Universal and Eternal Laws , that governs the Material and Psychological Universe --on the basis of which , you can make future planning. Modern day Scientists , have succeeded in combining , these two concepts and succeeded in Cosmological Studies. A simple way to start with , will be , to study popular books on Cosmology.... This will help you ,to acquire Universal Consciousness, in-spite-of the stresses and pains , you are living with. 

They are around, just that you don't see them. Likewise bacterias are everywhere, you don't see them. Not seeing/hearing is not existing obviously is scientifically proven false, but people tend to dwell in this fallacy without remorse. The way to learn is to improve the capacity. Bacterias can be seen by inventing microscope, but the Buddha seen them 2500 years ago. Maybe one day someone can invent devascope to see them; yet again you can learn what Buddha was capable and see them ?year ahead the inventor ~ :D 

From general knowledge I gleaned the conventional Theravada appeared in the English world doesn't practice for Bodhisattva. They admit 7 Buddhas included the future Maitreya as the totality of all in eons of Kalpas plus endless spacetime/universes. The highest goal of conventional Theravada is not a Buddha - there is no chance/ only 7 Buddhas existed the last one has already been claimed by Maitreya - but Arahat, who ended sufferings by realized Nibbana. Why the conventional Theravada said the Bodhisattva is a late notion, because the scholars said so. Like Saptha Visuddhi quoted Edward Conze in her/his whole post, Edward Conze's scholastic studies are equally as true as the Suttas, if not more scientifically correct with archaeological evidences! I didn't read Edward Conze, so I have no comment on Edward Conze's scholastic study however he laid hands on Mahayana didn't endorse him the authentic knowledge on the Mahayana teaching hence enabled him to conclude his conclusions. But by Saptha Visuddhi's interpretation of “Bodhisattva vow” if s/he derived her/his understanding from Edward Conze then it is wrong. Bodhisattva is already enlightened, but not entering Nirvana until all the beings are ferrying to the "other shore"/ free of suffering. It will take too long paragraph to explain for the English sect has too many wrong terms and wrong understandings. In 《解深密經》 the Buddha explaint when some Bodhisattvas seeing the horror of Naraka and other lower realms they were too horrified and could't endure Samsara anymore, they can choose to enter Nirvana, (I think these refer to the Hinayana sect's practice, need re-check the Sutra). But the higher level (esp. 8th level and above) will continuous to overcome those until reached perfect wisdom - Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi 等正覺, Buddha. 

In Hinduism it is said to be the place of Lord Shiva and his wife godess parvati, How is it related to Buddhist? Did Buddha himself ever said the importance of Mount Kailash? and if it is just a culture Buddhist follows how did it start? Jain's are also worshipping this sacred mountain. Buddhist Monk Milarepa have climbed Mount Kailash(is it true?) 

I am not sure if Buddha said it or not, I was flipping around some Buddha quotes pictures and found an image saying "Its better to travel well than to arrive". can anyone explain What does it mean ? Thanks 

Mind is a non living thing same as any object like a book or stone, it does not have its own existence, it is getting pran from soul. For example these trees and plants does not have soul, but there is one mind in earth. As Buddha says "Experience it, don't believe anything". So we are supposed to observe pran and chitta and then they are supposed to be mixed and become one. 

According to Mahayana Sutras, eggs have lives. Buddha concluded, there're four types of birthing: fetus, egg, humidity (濕生, not sure what's the correct etymology, it means born by wetness sort of, like bacteria that kind of life-form), and manifesting (化生, without parents or any media, just appear, like the life-form in Naraka/hell). Buddha taught, egg-born is caused by thought. It follows that an egg is the thought baby of the pigeon, I think. If the egg is eaten, it's like you're eating the baby of the mother-pigeon...! Some reports claim that hens can lay fertilized eggs without mating, it's a bit puzzling... Should we consider eggs are sentient beings? It's another puzzle, depends on how to define "sentient being". 

I think Jiddu Krishnamurti (not U. G.) is not particularly being concerned by any Buddhist. If you don't ask this question, this is not really a dish that's waiting to be served. This dish may even not exist. From past material I read, he was "chosen" by the Theosophical Society and groomed to be a spiritual leader, later he rebelled. Theosophical Society one of the founders was Helena Blavatsky who had learnt something from the Tibetan Lama, thus formulated her theory about the 5/7(?) races, the Atlanteans, Lemurians... and the Aryans are the supreme race... her theory later was adopted by Hitler... then we will have to go on analyzing the hands playing in the dark under the table, the world history and wars how these happened... OK. Pause. According to @sandeepani: The Theosophical Society has helped the of Buddhism greatly during the British Colonial Era in Sri Lanka and elsewhere. But their teachings were somewhat different still (a lot of mythical interest and combining religions), which caused many Buddhist members to leave it in later years. If you are seeking to nourish your spirit, your inner life, my advice is to seek pure, pristine teachings from great teachers. 

" For every action , there is an equal and opposite reaction ". This is a Fundamental law of Physics and is applicable to Human Mental activities. If fear comes as a reaction to the feeling of Intense Love ,you have to Absorb these reactions . Assume that these fears are Unreal and Temporary,wait for some time and allow the fears to die down .And then , continue with your daily activities--in this case--Meditation. 

According to the Law of Action and Reaction ,Every action of the Individual will be Neutralized by a Reaction from Nature. If you want Body Consciousness ,then you must think of Universal Consciousness. If you are concentrating or observing or being conscious of your Breathing Process (Pranayama) ,then think that the Air that you Breathe ,fills the Universe and Infinite Space as Ether . The Air becomes less and less dense ,as we move away from the Earth ,but it never-the-less exists as Ether (Sunya or Brahma ) . This thought will create an Universal Consciousness . Body Consciousness will come as a Reaction to this thought . An alternative , is to study some popular books on Cosmology. 

It is none of your business how the thinking mind works, as how the lung, the heart... the breathe works, unless you want to be a doctor, not the "student". 

I'm not very familiar with all the technical terms or schools things, but many of the Early Buddhist Schools original works are preserved in the Chinese Canon, such as, doctrine of Vibhajyavada sect should be found. But to another half of your title question: 

In short, the big principle Buddha taught is "you reap what you sow", which is big, but raw, right ;). Sow the good seeds then you will reap good fruits. That is Karma. Many people, esp. Western people when hearing this "Karma" at the 1st time will be disheartened reading it's a passivity, also this word is so corrupted by the New Age sect. Then is the Saḍ-pāramitā (六波羅蜜). In these 6, Dhyana is pursued by many modern-day Buddhists but I doubt if these teachings by those are really adequate. Suffering has it's use of cultivating wisdom... how to live well while suffering? there are more to say but. Hopefully I could find time to return to if. 

The idea is similar to the philosophy of Adwaita Vedanta in Hinduism. We may worship GOD with form (sakara , finite) or without form (Nirakara ,Infinite) .Worshiping a Human being as God or Son of God or Incarnation of God or Representative of God on Earth (Prophet, teacher, leader) etc. ,..is the First stage of Human Spiritual Development. Worshipping the INFINITE Nature or Universe -- or-- the Invisible Power or Laws that move and control it,..is the Second sage of Human Spiritual Development. Scientists Studying the Universe or Cosmos , trying to discover the Laws , that Govern the Universe , are in practice , worshipping that Infinite God . An would be cosmologist , first studies the works of Scientists like Newton ,Einstein etc. and second studies the Universe Himself ,taking the latest available information into consideration. He gets satisfaction only in the second stage . As he continues his study ,he might change or modify the thinkings of previous scientists , like Newton or Einstein and at a later stage , may give his own views or theory of the working of the Universe. So , the logic is this --- First ..Worship and follow the Buddha and then Second.. , go beyond Buddha , and think of the Infinite Universe YOURSELF. 

This is (P) This is not (-P) This is also is not (P also -P)1 Neither this is nor is not (Neither P nor -P)2 

No, Samatha alone can't reach Nirvana; even Vipassana can't; neither Nirvana necessarily produced by any Dhyana. Although recorded in the Vinaya Uppalavanna was entering the 9th Dhyana when staying in the Dark Forest where 500 robbers happened also tracked there, she was not entering Nirvana, she arose from the Dhyana the next morning. The 9th Dhyana called the "extinguishing" meditation (滅盡定) was the Buddha's unique discovery, he had learnt the 8 Dhyanas from his teachers that were known and practiced by the heretics at his time. I read from my sources Samatha (止) and Vipassana (觀) are always going together in Dhyana, they can't happen on its own, like a hand with the palm and back. Samatha is taking a passive approach, when thoughts arise, abandon that thoughts, closely observes any thought arose abandoned immediately - present of mind (not absent of mind, think of what is absent-minded, the opposite); Vipassana is taking the active approach, focus and work on the chosen meditation object, alert and patiently waiting for revelation. I've not heard that the three characteristics are to be considered as the rule to be obeyed in all meditation practices. They are the truth Buddha obtained in his own Prajna quest, he just told you that are the correct answers. But to learn, you have to work out the same answer. As a student working out the equation by doing computing, using calculator to output an answer or copying from your classmate doesn't mean you know the answer, you must be able to do the calculation on your own, then you obtain the answer - the Dharma, else they are just terms, vocabularies. So, you may choose one of the characteristics as your object to work your Vipassana on it. Personally I found that a visual object is easier to work Vipassana on, rather than concept. Maybe I'm just a beginner not knowing the sophistication of meditation yet. Samatha can't derive Prajna, it is just a background building for Vipassana to set on working, Prajna obtained by Vipassana. Even the Anapana meditation included Samatha and Vipassana, Samatha as setting mind to the breathe, the breath is also the object in Vipassana.
