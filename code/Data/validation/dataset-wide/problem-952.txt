CC BY-SA 3.0 The main wind pattern is also western, but with prevailing eastern winds, they might end up in Scotland, depending on the vessel. The Jutlandic coast has experienced a large number of shipwrecks in the past. 

Photosynthesis increase in the northern hemisphere spring, especially in the Siberian Taiga, and carbon dioxide decrease in atmosphere. During autumn and winter, decomposition of plant material and increased combustion, bring more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Measurements from e.g. the South Pole shows the same pattern, but much less and in opposite phase. As the temperate and boreal landmass are larger on the northern hemisphere, the oscillation is also larger. It's well explained here. Also check ESRL and CDIAC for more stations and downloadable data sets. 

Ice floats with gravity towards lower elevation, the flow continues until the base of the ice sheet becomes floating and the ice forms an ice shelf or icebergs. Due to the subglacial topography, basal melting and mass balance, the flow velocities vary over a large range, faster outflows are glaciers. The pattern is somehow similar to how rivers transport rainwater towards the coasts. The thickness of the ice sheet is controlled by a complex relation between accumulation, ablation and compaction. 

I don't know the book and the quality of fiction are rarely in the facts. However, it is always nice to think about the spinning of our planet and how our theories and methods relate to the actual astronomic observations. Historically there have been a number of prime meridians, sometimes used simultaneously and sometimes to large confusion. However, what reference you use doesn't change the duration of day and year. The calendars clearly described by Fred and kingledion are there to synchronize the day of year with the astronomic reasons for seasons. Farmers as well as priests plan the year according to the calendar dates and expect equinox at same day every year and the harvest to be in the same month. You can think of the prime meridian as the offset and the calendar as the frequency of our time units. Even when we refer the time zone to Greenwich it is still only a way to express the relation between time zones. With a US prime meridian the sun would still rise about 6am at equinox all over the world unless the evil pope in the book also forced a time zone of choice to people living near other meridians. However there might be situations where it's practical or politically motivated to use the same time across meridians, even if it means that some people will have sunrise well into lunch time at equinox. Technically, by moving the prime meridian some 30Â° to the west while keeping the Gregorian calendar would only delay the correction dates with a few hours, but on the other hand, people living just East of the International Date Line will get their correction a day earlier, and might appreciate the new cardinal coordinates, if they have an extremely strong sense for daylight and time. The Gregorian calendar was an important step to adjust the supernatural believes to actual observations. A year that is 365.2425 days long suggests a more complex universe than any simple cogwheel mechanics. If the evil pope really would like to suppress logic and perception, he or she should change the length of our time units rather than just relocating the coordinate system. 

Rifting is an ongoing process. At the moment, e.g. East Africa is rifting apart from the Nubian plate, we also see rifting of continental plates elsewhere, eg Rio Grande. New continents are being formed, but it doesn't happen on a human time scale. Modellers of future geography have a difficult task to decide what rifts that will stop and what rift that eventually will result in a new continent. See yellow marked faults and rifts: 

Some of the mountain ranges that today are located far from the coast, e.g. the Urals are formed from earlier convergent boundaries between continental plates that today are incorporated in larger plates. Convergent boundaries explains most of the mountain ranges (e.g the Andes, Himalaya, the Alps, Nihon Arupusu) but there are however some curious exceptions, e.g. the Scandinavian Mountains that are not located near any convergent boundary and might be the result of regional uplift. However, there is an interesting ongoing discussion on how these processes work. 

The main reason is that the Gulf Stream transports warm surface water from the tropics, driven by the thermohaline circulation. The tropical trade winds push surface water towards Western Atlantic and build up stress. Further north the dominant wind direction is towards the east. The Coriolois force also helps to move the warm water masses towards the east. The Labrador Current, on the other hand, brings cold water down West Atlantic Ocean. The thermohaline turnover is further south in West Atlantic Ocean. 

It's a huge field of research and a lot of interesting studies have been published over the years, but also a lot of speculation. Models and theories are mostly based on surface structures observed by remote sensing. Potential field data, as gravimetry can also add good constraints when available. Tectonic forces might be rather common in large young planets, but as they cool the process usually stops. In our time and solar system, plate tectonics as we would recognize it, is only known on Earth (and maybe Titan). Other tectonic forces can cause similar features by local uplifts, volcanism and cryovolcanism. Venus appears to have some kind of tectonic forces, at least in the past. An important part of the present research focus on the dynamics and chemistry of the Venusian mantle and how the topography helps us understand the development of the planet. The data from Magellan in the early 90's are particularly important. Studies of Venus also helps us to understand how tectonics developed on Earth. It's been suggested that lack of water as a lubricant in the Venusian upper mantle makes continental drift impossible, but mantle dynamics can still cause local/regional uplift and volcanism. Europa is also supposed to have an odd kind stress that resembles tectonics, but caused by the tidal force from Jupiter that deforms the moon. We have the same tidal deformation on Earth, but it is much stronger on Europa and can cause dynamics that mix the interior. Somehow similar to how one should roll and press a lemon before cutting it to squeeze out the juice. Galileo is the main source of data, still. Titan could be the candidate that most resemble Earth, but it's under debate and more data is needed. The reasons to have plate tectonic on a planet are complicated and debated. I wouldn't say that we even have a good understanding of the continental drift on Earth yet. The best approach to understand what is needed for tectonism is to look at the planets energy budget, how much heat is generated and how can it leave the planets internal system. The chemistry of the mantel is also important, some dishes boil, other dishes fry. Water or other fluids appears to be crucial. A rather interesting suggestion for Earth's unique plate tectonics is that it depends on additional energy harvested by the photosynthesis in green plants. It might be that life is the cause of mountains instead of the other way around. 

So... doesn't $\lambda$ cancel out!? This would imply that the latent heat of sublimation doesn't matter at all here, which I guess is possible since it's a kinetically controlled process. 

21.7%, by my calculations (338 / 1556 holocene-active volcanoes). I calculated perennial snow by combining 6 weeks of MOD10A2 data from winter and summer weeks in 2014 to figure out which pixels had snow both in the summer and the winter. My source code for that is available as a gist (an older version accidentally classified cloud as snow; that's been fixed). Then I checked if these pixels fell within 10km of the volcanoes in the Smithsonian Institution's Global Volcanism Database. I also plotted the woefully incomplete Global Land Ice Measurements from Space glacier polygons. There are clearly a few false-positives on ocean islands... I think this is due to MOD10A2 marking choppy surf as snow. Looking into that. I intend to publish this and will put a reference here if it is published. Here's what the map looks like for part of Alaska: 

The previous answers contain important facts, but neglect recent discoveries. As tobias47n9e says, the increase in observed output over time is an observational effect. As kaberett explains, if you're talking about megayear timescales, Large Igneous Provinces will have a large impact on the timeseries. However, LIP and all continental eruptions (~1km^3 / year) are dwarfed by midocean ridge seafloor eruptions (~3km^3 / year). Volcanologists have made major progress towards answering your question (are production rates trending? periodic?) over the last few years. We've learned that: 

The authors attributed these effects to decompression melting. If you remove a weight from above a magma chamber, the pressure in the chamber is reduced, and the melting temperature is lowered, causing an increase in the amount of melt available for eruption. (Personally, I suspect that it's not really decompression melting causing the change in eruption rate but actually just fractures opening and closing.) The Tolstoy paper claims that if you look at seafloor topography, you see bumps where more lava erupted and piled up higher. Further, it says those bumps correlate with the 100,000 year Milankovitch global climate cycle. So, orbital eccentricity --> sea level --> midocean ridge eruption rate --> seafloor topography. This is a brand new idea and needs much more testing. (Personally, I find the topography thing hard to believe because that topography is probably more fault-controlled than eruption-rate-controlled.) Tolstoy even claims that low tide causes eruptions! She uses a Schuster test to say that the majority of seafloor eruptions occur during neap tide. However, we don't observe seafloor eruptions very often, so she is making this claim using only 9 data points. It's currently unknown whether these unloading / loading effects are important at subduction zones or LIP. You've asked a difficult question which volcanologists have been attempting to understand for decades and will continue to work on for the foreseeable future. In summary, my answer is that cutting-edge research suggests that global eruption rate fluctuates in response to climate via changes in the masses pushing down on magma reservoirs. 

Together, these two claims seem to imply that if it's not thicker than 30m, it's not a glacier. Are either of these claims correct, and do they indeed imply my conclusion? N.B. The question arises because I've been working with some literature and databases that refer to things less than 30m thick as glaciers. Update: looking closer at GlaThiDa, I notice that it contains 490 glaciers listed with mean_depth less than 5m. However, all of these are from a single article (Cogley, 2008) and some of them are apparently only centimeters thick. Something must be wrong with this data; I'm looking into it. 

Looks like a shell from a bivalve of some kind, that has been worn presumably by wave action. You may want to update your question with more context. Where did you find it? Also, your photos are all out of focus and some are overexposed, so you may want to re-take the photos. You might also want to try asking on a biology or zoology site. 

The Glen flow law for glaciers is a common relationship linking stress to strain. At its simplest, $\Sigma = k\tau^n$ where $\tau$ is stress, $\Sigma$ is strain, and $n$ is roughly 3. I understand that $k$ depends on temperature and material properties of the ice, and that it can vary over two or three orders of magnitude. I have been searching the literature to find some example values of $k$ (also called $B$ and $A$) but so far I've had a surprisingly hard time. Is there somewhere that has a compilation of $k$ values from various studies? 

I've always understood that basalt is an extrusive rock (formed by eruption), and dikes are intrusions (no eruption), so I would have thought that a dike could not be composed of basalt rock. It's come to my attention that many people talk about "basalt dikes" in geology, and many websites, including pages of university geology departments, talk about dikes that are basalt. The concept of a "basaltic dike" (note the "ic") makes sense to me: a gabbro or diabase dike whose parental magma had a basaltic composition. So, I know that basaltic dikes exist, but I'd like to have confirmation that there is no such thing as a dike which is basalt rock.

There is an expression for sublimation rate as a function of latent heat flux $L$ and (specific) latent heat of sublimation (of water ice) $\lambda$.
