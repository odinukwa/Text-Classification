You can't. and rhetorically asking... And what do you count as a calorie burnt - are you counting just during your workout or recovery calories also? There is scientific evidence that your body burns more calories recovering based on intensity. Not sure how you can measure your intensity level. In my opinion I think cardio equipment giving read outs based on weight and distance is laughable too. If I run 1 mile in 5 mins compared to 6 I will burn more calories recovering. Every treadmill I have ever gone on would give me the same amount for the mile... 

Your lower back issue in all likely hood is caused by a small amount of disc movement. When you work out your muscles force them back into a good place - for you. The fact is the situation will probably get worse as you get older. You will have to start incorporating smart lifting methodology, specialized cardio and core routine, along with a stretching (yoga) routine to offset the effects of aging and the years of pounding you have put on your discs. I would also add that it really really helps to find a chiropractor that specializes in athletes. I used to go to doctors that talked about surgery and if not surgery told me everytime my back hurt to not do anything at all for 4-6 weeks (yep that made it much worse). A good sports chiropractor that understands that you are going to be active can help with alignment and stretching exercises and also deal with the 1-2 times a year your workouts don't fix the soreness. 

When you get trained to teach classes by a professional (company) they talk about keeping your audience focused and participating. So there are two main reason for switching of exercises: 

I have a basketball player that I am beginning to train. He was doing distance running and strained his outer arch in one of his feet. Looking for some recommendations on exercises or anything that he can do to help the issue. He will continue to play basketball on this no matter what so "rest" isn't a good answer here. Also he did this a couple of days ago and he said his foot felt better after playing for a bit but not 100% but then after he is in a lot of pain. 

You don't squat right. You go down to about 60 degrees and call it a rep. When you deadlift you are beyond the point where your squat ends. You haven't done enough deadlifts. It will take a few months of doing a lift before your helper muscles adjust. A person never doing deadlifts can't just naturally deadlift more if they haven't done them. Some people may take a few weeks, some a few months. You don't like doing them. Your attitude towards the lift decreases your adrenaline and you feel tired faster. 

Yes it is possible. There isn't anything ground breaking on the advice you will get on band training techniques. The books will basically give you creative ways to attach them. You want to be doing the same movement as your squat, deadlift, bench, (find a place to do pull ups and chin ups), curls, tricep extensions, good mornings, and so on... The movements don't change, how you attach the bands depends on what you have available. You can get in great muscular shape using bands. You will not put on a lot of mass quickly, your workouts will have to be pretty much non-stop (to get intensity), and you may have to settle on smaller gains but bands vs just body weight in the middle of no where... give me the bands to work with too (and do body weight exercises). I would also sprinkle in lots of plyometrics but I like speed builders. 

No just the opposite. The article is clearly saying that there is a link that during our heavy sleep our bodies use GH to repair ourselves. What you are proposing is getting less sleep or less quality of sleep which would then reduce the amount of GH secreted to our body. Also the GH is a repair mechanism (mainly). It can be enhanced due to vigorous/intense activities, sleep, and drugs. By working out at 2 AM you would be getting less sleep and I would guess from most people, not have the same intensity you could have during normal waking hours, therefore I would expect a decrease in GH levels. Also there is no correlation between GH levels and training periods, other than you need high GH levels after training for your body to repair. 

Allows for a more natural movement. You can do more movements. Could not do flies with a bar... A seasoned lifter does not need a spotter. Work your fixator/balancing muscles more. Force you to use each side equally. Can really help if you have a muscle imbalance. Can help stress smaller muscle groups. Stretches muscles better (with correct form) promoting more tendon strength. Always working out your fingers, hands, wrist, and forearms. Simulates athletic movements better, especially in the upper body. 

Even when I was at my peak and lifting 6 days a week with two leg days (at the time had been steady for 10+ years), there was not a single time I did legs and didn't feel it the next day. Even if I totally felt horrible and half-assed a workout I would be a little sore the next day. To me when I hear something like this I feel that you are spending a lot of time in the gym doing a lot of useless things. I mean if you want to go to the gym to burn 50 extra calories and be a little active that is fine but if you are looking to get stronger or really tone up you should feel it the next day. No pain no gain. 

When I hear cardio - I assume that you are getting your heart beat up to at least 70% max for 20 mins. With around 30 mins being a good time. I actually told my clients 30-40 mins because I know they would normally pick the lesser. I can cover this for 5 different possibilites- 

You must do legs in your workout. Think of your body as a growing tree. Have you ever seen a tree with a skinny trunk and huge branches? As your legs get stronger and you strengthen your core the rest of your body will fall in place - you have an upper body workout (that is probably not optimal but I don't know enough about you to recommend something exactly). With the equipment you have (don't have) I would do lots of deadlifts, light squats (you will have to clean the bar up and lift over your head - I know this sucks but a lot of home lifters have to do it - really light weight), good mornings (do a set of good mornings after a set of squats while the bar is there), and dumbbell squats. I personally would incorporate star bursts or frog jumps with this workout if I didn't have the weights to push myself. You can start with one set of each every other day (deadlifts should be first and you should be trying to lift as much as you can according to your plan eventually). And work up to a full legs/lower back workout that you are doing twice a week. I don't think once a week is enough given lack of equipment if you want results quickly. I know this will hurt. It will suck having to ride your bikes some days. But you need to start slow with the legs and work your way up - and your bike rides will actually be easier in the long run. As for the running 5km a week is not too much. Even with the biking. I would shoot for more but up to you. What can you expect. Well once you get used to your core/leg routine you can work on form and explosion. You will get stronger and you can get serious muscle tone if the intensity is right. However given the lack of weights/equipment you will probably plateau faster and easier. But then again I would work on intensity level and slowly increasing the weight.
