The chart chooses just the lowest number. The chart considers the foundation programme to be starting work rather than training and the university degree to be training. The source consistently calls the foundation programme training. 

I haven't yet been able to find whether the authors included this in their calculations or whether they used the same footprint per kilogram of meat as was used for human consumption. If the claim about meat-based pet food being primarily made up of off-cuts that would be otherwise burned is true, and the authors didn't include this in their calculations, the carbon footprint of meat-eating pets would be significantly smaller than the book claims. Phys.org also expresses some skepticism: 

There's also a conflict of interest. The author of the study sells a product that can solve the problems raised by the study: 

This chart suggests that the percentage of the No Religion group in the younger population is greater than in the overall population. As they get older, you would expect the overall population to more closely match what we see in the younger population now. This is the chart from 2006 but the chart from the 2013 census shows a similar pattern. 

There are rare cases where this system may not fit well, in which we describe people as intersexed. The above study that this answer is based on didn't have any intersexed individuals; all males were male by the standard biological definition, not to be confused with gender identity. 

Health benefits not claimed; merely potential The paper that this news story is based on appears to be "Improved extraction of green tea components from teabags using the microwave oven" (2012), Quan Vuong et al.. Its abstract begins: 

This source makes it sound like vaccination was deployed strategically to high-risk demographics, e.g. travelers and those near outbreaks, though it seems to claim that most of the population wasn't vaccinated. 

Most of the above seems to discuss traction alopecia, though here's a source that discusses "traction folliculitis", which appears to be related: "Traction Folliculitis: 6 Cases Caused by Different Types of Hairstyles That Pull on the Hair" (2009): 

Directly after your claim that the trial would have found statistically significant results if it had lasted longer, you make the claim: 

Amongst other errors such as severely underestimating the value for the carbon footprint of the car's manufacture. They also suggest that the authors have not included "indirect impact like roads, bridges, and fuel infrastructure." An article on Grist compounds up all these errors and adds a few more to calculate that the book authors are off by a factor of 18. 

An article on The Guardian mentions a flaw that has been raised with the book's methodology: that the meat used for pet food is not grown for the purpose and would still exist even if pets didn't. 

The chart states a value for a salary at five years but this information is not included in the source. The value £45,000 does not appear in the source. The average of the specialty doctor range listed above is around £53k however it should be noted that we don't know the actual distribution within this range. On a different page from the same site regarding GPs, the salary range is listed as between £55,412 and £83,617. The hours on that page are listed as 50. 

Anyway, since their equations usually blow up and they made-up fake values that just barely hold together, then whenever they change things a bit, the equations blow up again. And so, the authors report doomsday. 

Surveying a bunch of sources, I found a few that claimed that kerosene might cause cancer, though most seem to claim that there's no apparent connection with cancer. Despite the apparent lack of carcinogenicity, kerosene poisoning still has other problems. "Hydrocarbons Toxicity Treatment & Management" (2015) discusses research on how to treat kerosene ingestion. Most of the concern seems to be related to avoiding aspiration. Possible origin of cancer-curing stories If you do enough random testing, you'll find studies all over the place. I found one study that seems to report a ~15% decrease in apparent cancer rates (25 observed malignant neoplasms vs. 29.4 expected) for one group of men who had exposure to kerosene fumes: 

I'm skeptical of the explanation by police that methane from farting cows and a static electrical spark caused an explosion. 

An older article lists various doctors and tube drivers salaries together. The chart says that tube drivers earn £50k - £60k per year but the source says: 

A comment on the post mentions that three other authors of the study also work for L-Nutra. The study doesn't have any comparison to smoking but the press release from the lead author of the study does. 

When a result is not significant, it is not significant. We can't use an insignificant result to make the claim that the "advice resulted on a 22% death increase". We also can't say that it "bordered on statistical significance" without further evidence that it actually did. We certainly can't predict the future outcome of a trial without actually conducting the trial. If we could, we would be even have trials? A couple of paragraphs from Reflections on the Diet and Reinfarction Trial (DART) illustrate some of the problems with trials of this sort that lead to insignificant data. In the past, fibre has been seen as having a protective effect rather than the detrimental effect your article is claiming. 

Several papers have looked at the venom's biological effects while others have studied its effects in limited contexts. The overall opinion appears to be that remedies derived from blue scorpion venom aren't providing a verifiable benefit, with one study suggesting that it can worsen cancerous growth. 

Comments Cell phones raise their output power when they're struggling to get signal, such as if they're in a train that's going through a tunnel or competing with other nearby cell phones. This raises the risk for higher exposure under such conditions. It's worth noting that this problem is similar to why cell phones are discouraged on airplanes, leading to an "Airplane Mode" to be put into most modern devices. Activating this mode causes the cell phone's antennas to turn off. Assuming that all antennas are turned off, or at least the main ones, then I'd expect this to significantly reduce the risk to nearby pacemakers. One complicating factor is that technology's rapidly changing, including the types, powers, and frequency of signals being used. This makes it hard to say with certainty that new devices, or devices that'll be out in a few years, won't pose new threats. Interesting factoids from the cited references 

One extra thing: I would imagine most doctors are well aware that a university degree actually has a negative value, not £0 as it costs a significant amount of money. 

The future is difficult to predict which is why we tend to avoid it here at Skeptics. These trends show what will happen if the forces at work do not change and the rates stay constant. Predicting for certain that the rates will stay constant until 2050 is beyond the abilities of science. 

It is likely that they did a simple projection of the current trends into the future to make this prediction. On the regular census that the New Zealand Government runs, they ask each citizen what their religious affiliation is. Here are the results for the last four censuses. 

This also implies that you do not have a license to practice medicine until after the two-year foundation programme which makes calling the salary you earn during this time a starting salary inaccurate. The source states directly after the starting salaries: 

Biology is known to cause behavioral differences It's probably common knowledge that behavior-affecting hormones vary significantly by sex. For example, adult males have about 20 times the the testosterone level of adult females. In popular culture, testosterone is often taken to characterize male behavior. 

come from 2008-11-04, at which point Google indexes three sources: 1; 2; 3. This PDF from 2008-11-19 also has the quote on page 27. The strange thing about all of these sources is that none of them is primarily English-speaking. This is unusual for the early internet, especially as a source for an alleged English quote allegedly from an English source. However, Source (1) has Spanish variant linked on it: 

There's been a lot of research looking for cancer-causing compounds, i.e. carcinogens. Research in this area seems to conclude that kerosene exposure is mostly unconnected to cancer. While I haven't found a reference that explicitly claims that kerosene doesn't cure cancer, presumably this would be noted if such an anomalous result was found. Pretty much all sources seem to agree that kerosene is toxic and shouldn't be ingested. The primary concern seems to be about kerosene inhalation, which can occur due to aspiration following ingestion. Other sources have noted that kerosene may cause cancer on prolonged skin contact. Finally, it's worth noting that kerosenes are a huge mixture of many different compounds, some of which are believed to cause cancer. Health safety publications Regarding carcinogenicity, some studies have pointed toward increased cancer rates in connection to kerosene exposure, though most sources seem to conclude that the potential connection is weak: 

Yes, excessive alcohol is neurotoxic. This has been proven beyond any reasonable doubt; there is a substantial body of research in the field going back for quite some time. Evidence for this comes from a wide range of animal based research (for examples, see Crews FT, Nixon K (2009) Mechanisms of neurodegeneration and regeneration in alcoholism. Alcohol and Alcoholism 44:115. & Obernier JA, Bouldin TW, Crews FT (2002) Binge Ethanol Exposure in Adult Rats Causes Necrotic Cell Death. Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research 26:547-557.) as well as clinical studies in human populations (eg: Harper C (2007) The neurotoxicity of alcohol. Human & Experimental Toxicology 26:251.). However, there is also some evidence that low-to-moderate alcohol consumption may have neuroprotective effects: see Ruitenberg A, van Swieten JC, Witteman J, Mehta KM, van Duijn CM, Hofman A, Breteler M (2002) Alcohol consumption and risk of dementia: the Rotterdam Study. The Lancet 359:281-286. There is still considerable dispute within the research community about the exact mechanisms of alcohol-induced neurotoxicity. Likely candidates include oxidative stress, inflammation-related cerebral overpressure and glutamatergic excitotoxicity. See Crews FT, Collins MA, Dlugos C, Littleton J, Wilkins L, Neafsey EJ, Pentney R, Snell LD, Tabakoff B, Zou J (2004) Alcohol-induced neurodegeneration: when, where and why? Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research 28:350-364. for an overview of these possibilities. 

Holland refers to their technology as "pulse magnetotherapy (PEMF)"; Wikipedia lists this as a synonym for "pulsed electromagnetic field therapy (PEMFT)". 

tl;dr- The research in question claims that microwaving can increase extraction of several compounds in tea; presumably, the news report assumes that these compounds are healthy. Despite the news report's wording, there's no conclusive evidence that the compounds extracted from tea are healthy, as stated in daniel's answer; this position seems to be shared by the researchers who describe the health benefits as "potential". The quoted author publishes a separate paper discussing links to health benefits, but he also publishes a third paper that says that caffeine can have a negative impact on some people. The paper on potential health benefits also discusses potential health hazards. Overall, the researchers are reporting that microwaving tea can help increase the amount of several of the chemicals of interest by about ~20% vs. their baseline preparation method. It appears that the researchers suspect that one of these chemicals, catechins, is potentially quite desirable, and this suspicion seems to form the cornerstone of their interest in human health.
