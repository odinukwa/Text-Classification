However, the article which describes the experiment notes that patients with abnormal heart-rate recovery also had other indicators of poor cardiovascular health, meaning the cause-effect relationship might not be so clear: 

Which suggests that achieving higher levels of fitness might increase the heart rate recovery value and help reduce the health risks, as most studies suggest anyway. Athletes and fitter persons might have heart recovery rates larger than 30 bpm. 

Most articles nowadays seem to favor High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) compared to Steady State Cardio (SS), for various reasons like faster fat loss and getting higher levels of cardio fitness in the same time period. Not only that, but exercise retention among individuals has been much better due to shorter durations of HIIT workouts, which is a good thing. There are even articles which claim that HIIT might improve aerobic capacity and quality of life in people with heart diseases (compared to steady aerobic cardio). Articles which warn against excessive endurance excercise (Potential Adverse Cardiovascular Effects From Excessive Endurance Exercise, Exercise training reduces resting heart rate via downregulation of HCN4) mostly deal with marathon runners and cyclists - although it's not clear whether it's the endurance part that should be emphasized. On the other hand, some articles note that there is a difference in heart adaptation between HIIT and SS cardio: on one hand there is a Concentric Hypertrophy of the Heart in HIIT (due to anaerobic stresses), vs the Eccentric Hypertrophy of the Heart for SS, which increases the stretch reflex (less energy used per beat). According to Wikipedia, concentric hypertrophy is the less appealing type of hypertrophy, because it increases wall thickness without increasing the chamber radius, which can "impair filling and lead to diastolic dysfunction". (Update) Again, regarding endurance, there is an article which describes an "U-shape" distribution of mortality as a function of exercise pace, quantity, and frequency, i.e. a potentially reduced benefits of endurance cardio if taken too far: 

I'm no expert, but I trained oly lifts for a while. My best power clean was 265lbs at 6'1", 190lbs. I can give you anecdotes and tips, for what they're worth. It takes quite a while to start getting comfortable with the clean. It took at least some months for me, possibly 3 or 4 before I started trying to progressively overload. I didn't want to go over 135lbs for the longest time. Be patient, it's a really complex movement. Once you get it, it will make sense, but it really does take a while. Every beginner I've seen likes to try to catch the weight in their hands with their wrists hyperextended, so you aren't alone there. To get a feeling for what the weight should truly feel like in the front rack position, do zombie squats: 

Another option is the Withings Pulse, which is a little widget that doesn't really fall into any of these categories: 

Decreased pancreas function means an impact on insulin, which means an impact on muscle growth. Decreased sleep means an impact on cortisol, insulin, and growth hormone, which means an impact on muscle growth ($URL$ These are just a couple of examples of physiological effects. There is a font of information out there proving alcohol does the body or the mind absolutely no good. 

Welcome to your own version of the paleo diet, whereby your body isn't being damaged by the foods you eat. Personally I like to eat a lot more fat and veggies but if you're happy, stick to it. Contrary to popular opinion, your body is not a battery, it does not always store excess energy. Your body is an exquisite self-regulating machine. If your body is healthy and well-nourished it will regulate your hunger so that you only eat what you need. It will also remove excess fat and even store some fats and protein as muscle. In other words, the body will look like its genetic blueprint. One thing though, it looks as if your diet may be deficient in omega-3 fats. Consider adding fatty cold ocean fish like salmon to your diet. 

Fiber is, by definition, indigestible carbohydrate. It either gets processed by the bacteria in your colon or it goes on to the exit. If your gut flora uses it, the "good" bacteria will produce some vitamins and short-chain fatty acids from it (which you metabolize and are good for you) plus some toxins, and the "bad" bacteria will just create toxins. Insoluble fiber (e.g. grains) will scratch the insides of your gut. Personally, I avoid it. Cows are mammals that are masters at handling fiber. Their natural diet gives them, after fermentation, almost 70% from energy as short-chain fats. Gorillas have a really big hindgut and also get most of their energy through fermentation. We humans lack the three stomachs and/or very long gut and therefore can't handle as much fiber. Furthermore there are several examples of populations that eat no fiber at all and nevertheless are healthy (like the Masai and Inuit). So in conclusion, fiber gives bulk to your stool as well as giving you some extra energy as fat and if you're eating too much of it, inflammation. It is not something to avoid, and not something to seek out. Bloating and gas probably means that your gut flora is having a field day at your expense. 

We came up with a push / pull / legs routine with some pretty standard stuff: Monday, Wednesday, Friday: 

A study on Ironman triathletes found that supplementing sodium during a triathlon had no real effect on blood sodium. (source) 

So the big hubbub surrounding bodybuilding and one hour is the hormone cortisol. This is going to be a bit long-winded, but bear with me. What's cortisol and why is it important? Well, first we need to know a little bit about how muscle tissues work in an anaerobic state. (An anaerobic state is where you're working so hard your body can't supply oxygen quickly enough to the muscles: weight lifting at moderate to high reps, high intensity intervals, that sort of thing.) Contrary to an anaerobic state, an aerobic state is when the muscles are able to use cellular respiration (aerobic glycoloysis) to fuel themselves. In this state, the body is able to supply both oxygen and sugar (glycogen) to the muscle fibers quickly enough, so that the cells don't need to use stored energy to do work. The "stored energy" part is important. When your muscles are operating anaerobically, they have to use their stored energy source (called ATP) to get the work done. Now that brings us to bodybuilding. There are two parts of the muscle we care about: the sarcoplasm and the myofibril. Here's a good illustration: 

For example, the chart shows that heart rate recovery of ~10 bpm suggests ~4 times larger risk than the baseline (2 to 7 times with 95% confidence). The article also defined "peak exercise" as being as strenuous as possible, possibly even larger than the theoretical heart rate reserve: 

The jogging pace in the image above might be related to HIIT, for example. So, while everyone agrees that regular exercise improves cardiovascular fitness, lowers resting heart rate and increases longevity on average, it still appears that hypertrophy effects of HIIT might be more problematic in the long term? 

I am having trouble "reconciling" having a proper posture while doing abdominal breathing. If I understand correctly, proper posture should involve pulling the abdomen in, among other things, while diaphragmatic (belly) breathing involves exactly the opposite. Is it possible to keep the abdomen tucked in, and breathe abdominally at the same time? 

with "peak exercise" described as being as strenuous as possible, possibly even larger than the theoretical maximum heart rate (220 - age). The article also defines a certain cut-off point: recovery rate of less than 12 bpm (in 1 minute) after peak exercise as being an indicator of poor cardiovascular health, with recovery rate of 20 to 30 being the "sweet spot": 

Personally, when I ran 5/3/1 variants I always drove to a hill immediately after leaving the gym to get some conditioning in (I think this makes more since than doing it immediately before). On off days I'd go to the same hill on my lunch hour from work. But, as he says, just get it done. Do it whenever is most convenient for you. 

The idea is to go with maximum intensity for 30 seconds (unless otherwise stated). We're finding that it gets the heart rate going a little bit but doesn't make us sweat, exhausts the muscle a little bit, gets us out of our chairs every hour, and is fun because it builds some team morale. 

To put on as much muscle mass as possible, you should be aiming to utilize the ATP/Creatine Phosphate/Glycolytic energy system. So, 75-85% of your 1RM, 8-10 reps, 3-5 sets, and 1-3 minute rest time between sets. 

You'll be amazed at how great this exercise feels. If you've been stuck in forward head posture for a long time, you'll feel as though your entire upper spine is waking up. Once you've developed some "normal" flexibility in your neck, you can start to strengthen the muscles so that they are more balanced. This will help keep your head upright. The exercises you'll want to incorporate to your workout routine are: Cervical flexion: 

Weight loss is still poorly understood. What's certain is that if you starve yourself, you will lose weight, and if you massively overeat for a sustained period of time, you will gain weight. Everything in between is less predictable. Our body isn't stupid, if it detects an imbalance it will correct it. Eating only this cereal might make you thin, or it might make you fat. It might also make you deficient in whatever this cereal doesn't provide. One of the ideas gaining popularity is that human beings aren't broken by default, and that something about our diet causes our body to get overweight (and eventually sick). Exactly what causes it is unknown, but large doses of wheat, fructose and Omega-6 poly-unsaturated fats as well as highly processed foods have been fingered as the culprits. Paleo dieters avoid these things (and call them Neolithic Agents of Disease :-) ) and the body returns to a more natural equilibrium. Personally, I first lost weight and then gained muscle and energy avoiding these NADs, without counting calories so I'm convinced that my regular diet was not healthy. I ate mostly a standard american diet with an extra helping of sweets. This cereal doesn't look too highly processed, but personally I wouldn't eat it because of the wheat content and because there are so many other foods that are much yummier.
