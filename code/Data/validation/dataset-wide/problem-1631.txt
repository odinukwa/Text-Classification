It'll be even better understood once one knows that, from the second EPA article, "The average radon concentration in the indoor air of Americaâ€™s homes is about 1.3 pCi/L" (~48 Bq/m3). But some are going to be more, and it should absolutely be tested on a case by case basis (a figure the Wiki article claims in the Concentration Scale section is a universal rating of 100 Bq/m3 (2.7pCi/L) for a house, which is certainly higher than the EPA's recommended amount). To wrap this up with some more modern statistics, take a look at the EPA fact sheet from a pooled study from 2005 (emphasis mine, extra parenthesis and spacing issues theirs): 

And an older study (subscription only, sorry) from the Journal of the American Medical Association found that (footnotes mine): 

Much to my surprise, it looks like this is probably true. According to a database on inheritance maintained by Johns Hopkins University and the National Institute of Health, it would appear that ear wiggling is in fact an autosomal dominant trait. That means that if a person has at least one dominant version of the ear wiggling gene, then that person should be able to wiggle his/her ears. (If anyone would like a to brush up on dominance, Wikipedia (of course) has a decent article.) It's worth noting, however, that I could find no other published information about this alleged gene. It looks like there's a gene there, but we don't yet have it mapped, and it's not being actively studied. I did find an interesting article published by Discovery that doesn't talk about genetics, but rather about the physical mechanism for ear movement (among other aural phenomena). Here's the part about wiggling: 

So if we assume that the gene does exist, then unless one has the gene, it's true, one cannot "learn" to wiggle one's ears. That's not to say, however, that a person with the gene is just going to be able to wiggle away. As the Discovery article implies, it doesn't look like it's a movement that comes particularly naturally to humans - it might still wind up being a learned process for some people. Point being, it's entirely possible one can "learn" to wiggle, but it looks like one probably needs a specific dominant gene to do so. Edit: As Fabian let me know, the original study I initially found is freely available online. The .pdf can be found here, the study is on pages 620-621. Worth noting is that the author of the study essentially gives the same "this study is small and not necessarily indicative of anything" warning that I did above: 

1: Winter FD, Snell PG, Stray-GundersenJ. Effects of 100% oxygen on performance of professional soccer players. JAMA. 1989;262:227-229 It goes on to reiterate what was already concluded here, this time by citing a study over 30 years ago (footnote numbering theirs, source and emphasis mine): 

Check out the abstract there for a table with the actual figures. The table goes a long way towards showing that people claiming to physically feel different are probably heavily placebo influenced. Their heart rates are elevated, but the oxygen content of their blood is the same (more on this later). It follows that some people might feel (un)pleasantly lightheaded or something else, but it's unlikely to be anything serious or particularly meaningful. Earlier than that, a report from a 2002 issue of the FDA Consumer (reproduced here at a different website) about oxygen bars made a lot of points to help debunk the idea that inhaling extra oxygen is good for you/useful at all (emphasis mine): 

This one was fun to look into, as I've often wondered about those bars, as well as football players/other athletes as they sit on the sidelines and suck down O2 from a mask. Short answer: Nope! That said, for a "normal, healthy individual without respiratory problems," they're not really gonna hurt anyone, either. Long answer, with science and stuff: From a small study that was done in 2004 at Indiana University, researchers took some college students with no heart or lung conditions, and did a single-blind test where some were given oxygen to consume, and some were given regular compressed air. They found that (emphasis mine): 

As I alluded to above, and as Dr. Purucker explains, humans are pretty heavily adapted to optimally breathe oxygen from an en environment of ~78% nitrogen and ~21% oxygen. In fact, blood leaving the lungs is already 97% saturated with oxygen, just from breathing normally. It seems highly unlikely that even breathing a solution of 95%-100% oxygen is going to do much more to optimize one's blood oxygenation. Finally, I know it wasn't explicitly asked about, but I feel like it's also worth including some information about athletes breathing supplemental oxygen. The same FDA report explains about athletes that: 

1: Impossible, since they're intentionally only drawing from their pool of active participants. The last straw for me before I stopped reading was on page five, when they give the demographics of the women involved (emphasis mine): 

I found a few good sites that do seem to confirm this, but on the whole captains, officers, and engineers seem to be very well compensated for the major airlines. From PayScale.com, there's a decent chart displaying the average range of salaries of all positions of some major airlines, which shows that United might have a fairly low salary for certain positions. That said, the average seems to fall around $100,000, and some easily go above $200,000 (most likely for captains). This is confirmed by this interactive chart, which is just pretty darn cool in its own right. If one chooses to look at United, it looks like their first officers in their first year don't make a whole lot, but that number quickly rises over the years to the average mentioned above. And captains, as I speculated, seem to be able to make just about $200,000 per year with enough experience. So this is probably true in specific cases, and Moore was exemplifying that to make some point, I'm sure, but is widely false. 

There are just so many things wrong here, that any result they come up with should not be taken at all seriously. They've got an agenda, they most likely had a hypothesis they were out to prove, they're introducing opinion into what should at least try to be a scientific paper, they're not sampling randomly, they're only taking from their own participant pool, and the participant pool itself was demographically skewed. Did they look at age? Income? The number of years a couple had been together/had been married? If the couple had lived together before getting married? If they had already had kids or not before getting married? If they had already had kids or not before getting divorced? If so, how many? This is all just off the top of my head. So no, I sincerely doubt Natural Family Planning dramatically reduces the chance of a divorce. Edit: Responding to the modified parts of your question. I wasn't sure what the USCCB was, but Googling it led me to the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, so I'm assuming that's what you're referring to. The quote you've posted (seeing where you got it from would be nice) is a much better track to take, but as has been said, FAF isn't really approaching that at all. Think about all the questions I asked at the end of my original answer, and whether they (and others) are being addressed. As far as the assumption you make that the study proves that faithful Catholics are less likely to be divorced... well... that's really quite an assumption. What defines a Catholic as faithful? That the Church condemns divorce and so they'd never do it? Were all the people in FAF's study part of that group? Is that really "faith"? I could just as easily assume that all the study proves is that white people are far less likely to wind up divorced. When you get into subjective land, it's tough to get out. So no, that assumption really doesn't have much merit either.
