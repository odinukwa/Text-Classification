Meetup is a useful place for meeting people with similar goals. Most towns, especially college towns, have a local running club; surely you can Google around for more info. Or inquire at your local running store. They're usually very familiar with the local clubs and events. The track club in my college town even led a marathon training program every summer. Perhaps you can find something like this. These are often very friendly to first timers. You can run with the group while making new friends to train with. As someone who has been running for 12 years and has trained for distances from 13.1 all the way up to 100 mile races, I will say this about marathon training. You will fail if you rely too heavily on other people for motivation. You have to figure out why running a marathon is important to YOU, and let your actions match those values. Running should be fun amid all the pain. If it's so miserable you can't do the occasional training run alone, something's wrong. Concentrate on what you like about it and don't give yourself time to picture the hard parts before you're out the door. 

Various Core Exercises - You have to improve your core muscles to have overall stability and balance while doing your Daily activities, stronger core muscles can even prevent further back pains. I recommend all variations of Planks and also all variations of crunches. 

Your Lower back Pain seems to emerge from you studying too much, which means that you don't have a correct posture or proper seat with support. Although you can alleviate the pain, i recommend checking in your posture to prevent future problems such as chronic back pains. Exercise increases blood flow and boosts muscle activity , hence alleviating pain. You can perform the following stretches to further alleviate and build a stronger back. 

Not feeling anything in your abs means that your abs arent getting the workout that they are supposed to . The key to developing strong abs is to perform the crunches slowly, let the muscles slowly expand and then contract, even on the negative rep where you are going back down. If you work them out well then you should feel a subtle burning sensation in your abs by the 12th rep. You may also increase the inclination for further toughness. 

Sounds like an imbalance of core to back strength, aka gods weight belt. Basically when doing any kind of multi joint or compound exercise, you need to think about engaging the core because it is the anterior wall to the lower back. What happens during a squat, when someone does not engage the core is that the back and quads over-compensates for the movement and the hamstrings and abs get weaker. Think about how much load/force is being put onto the back if you completely relax your core. Over many years the back becomes tight and overworked and eventually becomes prone to injury. Learn to balance your body, focus on front lever, body lever, leg lifts, saxon side bends, to strengthen your core. 

One of the major things you will notice with alcohol consumption (more specifically liquor) is that: 

-40 meter dash x 3 sets - take a 3 minute rest inbetween -hill sprints for 30 seconds -Power leap (from a full squat position, leap as high as you can, as far as you can for 15 reps) for 3 sets. This can all be done outside. 

The direct bone to bone punch could have got you a hairline fracture, (checkout the boxers fracture aswell) Or it could be a sprain. This is more likely, but be careful, stretching a sprained ligament only aggravates the problem, if it is a minor sprain, then you have to wear wrist support till the sprain heals itself. 

Its great that you love running up the stairs. You are correct that coming down has a slight negative effect on the legs specifically the knees. Running up for that matter, has very less impact on your joints, unless you stomp. The majority of the pressure is on your calf muscles, which is obviously a good thing... Over time your muscles grow stronger. You should also check out competitive stair climbing called "tower running". Where athletes from all over the world compete in climbing famous towers. Regarding the shoes, there is no specific standard but i would recommend a flat sole with powerful grip so as to avoid any accidents due to tripping. Best of luck and enjoy the climb! 

First off, You should probably ask yourself this - ( Am I getting enough sleep, in general ) If you aren't sleeping at least 8 hours a night, then yes the body tends to overcompensate by sleeping more when it has the opportunity to. But it isn't about the quantity of the sleep either. The quality is actually more if not equal importance which means getting sleep in a complete dark room, as light can have an adverse effect on melatonin - the hormone secreted by the pineal gland which controls your sleep cycles There have been studies where even a crack of light can affect how your body produces melatonin and in a world where we are constantly surrounded by light be it our phones, night lights, computers and lamps, it affects our sleep considerably. Now my suggestion would be to completely black out your room the days you have to stay up late to artificially create a night time environment and also take 2 hour naps if you lack sleep. 

It looks like all your attention is on your upper body and lower body exercises, try developing the core muscles as well, developing your core will increase balance/stability and will reduce the chances of injury. Try Planks(All variations), crunches and back extensions. Running/jogging also builds up your core. If the chronic pain is too much or is consistently there even after exercises, then you might as well get diagnosed by a doctor. 

Judging by your height and weight, you seem like you require a more beginners approach to weight lifting and power lifting is not recommended. Since you dont have a solid base, it will be very tough for you to mantain a proper form. I recommend you to start using machines for all the mentioned exercises, the machines prevent unwanted injuries and also help mantain your form, work on the free weights only with an instructor spotting you and looking out for your form. Slowly progress increasing your strength and know your limits, as excessive weight can severely harm your back or cause troublesome injuries.
