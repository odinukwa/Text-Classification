As I understood from my lectures, a multiplicative function means that the marginal product of one factor increases when another factor increases, and decreases when another factor decreases. The extreme cases (leontieff or additive) don't have this property. At the moment the teacher explained this, it made sense to me. If one factor increases, it expands the capacity of the other to produce more. I think it makes sense. 

I think this is because of liquidity. If I am a poor household, and I own stocks (maybe via my pension?), if the price of those stocks go up, I cannot consume such extra income. Actually, if the stock market crashes, my capital gains can be wiped out! So in a sense, this is not "actual purchasing power", as it is the case with direct income like wages or transfers. So, to the day to day interest of a household, capital gains should not be relevant for their wellbeing. 

Page 75 of document: $URL$ I see, as Alecos suggested, that debt includes both loans and bonds. Itwas my mistake to assume debt is only bonds. 

Money has to be used in all transaction. So Q refers to all transactions. In the early literature Q refered to commodities. This includes everything, from inputs to outputs. So you should include not only GDP but also intermediate transactions. Using only GDP is like thinking that only final goods were bought using money! This is plainly wrong. 

Notice that we only need to check the first three steps, what Ann believes Bob believes Ann believes is the same as what Ann believes Bob believes Ann believes $\ldots$ Bob believes Ann believes. The same procedure applies to a similar situation of interchanging Ann and Bob in the above reasoning. To make the baseline result that common belief implies backward induction, we can switch to hyperreal-valued belief system. Specifically, a player will not rule out any of her opponent's strategies. If she believes an opponent is rational, and strategy $s_1$ yields higher payoff compared with $s_2$ for this opponent, then she will believe that $s_1$ is infinitely more likely than $s_2$. Now, if it's the case that Ann believes Bob is rational, then Bob should believe that then the chance Ann plays $“Out"$ at the third node conditional on that she plays $“In"$ at the first node is smaller than $\frac{2}{3}$. But if Ann believes Ann believes Bob believes Ann of type $t_a$ and $u_a$ is rational, then the standard part of the probability that Ann plays $“Out"$ at the third node conditional on that she plays $“In"$ at the first node equals $1$. Of course, exactly the same argument works for lexicographic probability which is more parsimonious. My guess is that one of drawback to prevent hyperreal probability form wide application may be that we can't define infinite product of infinitesimal number. For example, in an infinite extensive game, a player believe that the probability that the probability of reaching each node of a path equals $\epsilon$ which is the equivalence class of $(1, \frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{5}, \ldots,)$ up to a fixed ultrafilter on $\mathbb{N}$. Of course, we expect that the chance that this path is realized should also be infinitesimal. But notice that $\epsilon = \epsilon_n := \{a_i^n\}_{i \in \mathbb{Z_+}}$ in which \begin{eqnarray}a_i^n= \begin{cases} 1, &i<n \cr mn^{n-1}, &i=n \cr \frac{1}{i}, &i>n\end{cases} \end{eqnarray} Contrasted with finite product, if we define the inifinite product of hyperreal numbers as their componentwise product, then, in this case, we can make it equal any real number $m$. 

Two things to note here. First, subtracting inflation from the nominal interest rate is an approximation to the real interest rate, but only in discrete time. Furthermore, the "true" relationship it's approximating isn't division of one rate by the other--you have to add 1 to all three of your quantities (inflation, real interest rate, and nominal interest rate) first to get the true relationship. Here's a brief overview. Consider the Fisher equation of $r = i - \pi$ where $r$ is the real interest rate, $i$ is the nominal interest rate, and $\pi$ is the inflation rate. This equation is often introduced as a linear approximation to the true real rate of interest, given by the equation $\frac{1 + i}{1 + \pi} = 1 + r$ Let's see how this holds in a discrete time model. Denote your nominal income as $Y$ and the price level as $P$. Your real income is $Y/P$. If all this income is invested in some interest-bearing asset in a discrete time model, your real income in the next time period becomes $\frac{Y (1 + i)}{P (1 + \pi)}$ and if we want to find a real interest rate that summarizes this change in real income, we would need to write your real income in the next time period as $\frac{Y}{P} (1 + r)$ which gives us the identity $\frac{1 + i}{1 + \pi} = 1 + r$ that the Fisher equation approximates. However, if we work in continuous time, this breaks down. First, the units don't work out--inflation rates and interest rates are measured in percentage change per year (or some other unit of time), so they cannot be added to the dimension-less number $1$. Second, it turns out that Fisher's approximation is actually completely correct in continuous time. Using derivatives, we define our quantities as follows: $i = \frac{dY}{dt} \frac{1}{Y}$ $\pi = \frac{dP}{dt} \frac{1}{P}$ $r = \frac{d(Y/P)}{dt} \frac{1}{(Y/P)}$. Using the quotient rule, we can rewrite $r$ as $r = \frac{\frac{dY}{dt}P - \frac{P}{dt}Y}{P^{2}} \frac{1}{(Y/P)}$ which simplifies to $r = (\frac{dY}{dt} \frac{1}{P} - \frac{dP}{dt} \frac{Y}{P^{2}}) \frac{P}{Y} = \frac{dY}{dt} \frac{1}{Y} - \frac{dP}{dt} \frac{1}{P} = i - \pi$ which gives us the Fisher equation, no approximations about it! Note that this assumes continuous compounding from your nominal interest rate. If you instead have a compounding rate of $\tau$, we would define $i$ differently, and our equation becomes $r = \tau \ln(1 + \frac{i}{\tau}) - \pi$. However, for the purposes of the data you're working with, I am 90% sure that this modification is completely superfluous. If you want to use something more precise than the Fisher equation, you need to know exactly how your data was computed. What price index was used to calculate the inflation rate? Under what assumptions was the nominal interest rate calculated? In short, while I can't speak to the reasons for your supervisor's recommendation, they're definitely correct that you should subtract inflation rather than divide by it. There's a reason why we use the Fisher equation. 

I'm interested to know the exact magnitude of impact of Subprime Mortgages crisis on major players in investment banking. In particular, how can I find data for percentage of revenue from Subprime Mortgages in total revenue for major banks, like Goldman Sachs, Morgen Stanley, The Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers? 

I would like strongly recommend David Kreps' latest textbook, Microeconomic Foundations I: Choice and Competitive Markets . It contains true virtuosity and is very inspiring. Take utility representation theorem as an example. Kreps forsake the assumption in MWG of taking $\mathbb R^n$ as the underlying space so that readers won't be left with the false impression that this theorem is of limited interest. I also $\heartsuit$ the presentation of GE as a generalized NE which helps developing connections between different areas. 

What does Pierpaolo Battigalli really mean? If the actions for a player chooses has been specified, then it automatically specify a pure strategy. By this methodology, he seems to want to distinguish a game structure with commitment and a game without, but how? Added: Here is the slides used in the video, and here is the corresponding paper. 

My question is, to what degree, this reasoning can be justified? My feeling is that, for an auction with an infinite type space and at least one bidder having a partition of infinite cells, it is wrong(see Geanakoplos and Polemarchakis (1982)). To proceed, it seems to me, one needs to represent a bidder's bidding strategy as a function measurable with respect to her own type, and history records of bidding, which seems to be quite complicated.

I have a question. A company is worth 1 million dollars, in terms of present value of revenues, discounted at rate R. Can I borrow 1 million dollars from a bank and buy the company? If the bank charges me R, I am indifferent? Or, can I issue a bond for 1 million, with coupon R? Am I indifferent too? Do these things happen? Do businesses ask for credit or issue bonds in order to buy companies? 

Risk is important. A bond (or even a credit) is backed up by the company's assets. Companies go bankrupt because of a mismatch between assets and liabilities maturities (e.g. cannot pay a bond of a loan), but not because they are unsustainable in the long run. If a company goes bankrupt, debtholders are the first on the list (after workers, in some countries) to receive compensation. Sometimes they do assume losses, when the debt is negotiated at a lower value. The shareholder is the last one to get any money out of the assets of the company. So being a shareholder is more risky than being a bondholder. 

Suppose three advertisers, I, II, III are participating in an auction for three positions for online advertising, top, middle and bottom. Assume that click per second for a position is not affected by who poses an advertisement there. For top, the click through rate is 3 click per second, for middle, it's 2, for bottom, it's 1. But advertisers have private value per click. For I, it's \$16 per click. For II, it's \$15. For III, it's \$14. The one who submits the highest wins the top position and pays the second highest bid, second highest bidder got the middle position and pays the third highest bid. The third highest bidder end up with bottom position, but pays zero. If there's a tie, then choose the winner ramdomly by a fair dice. The strategy space for each bidder is $\mathbb{R}_{+}$. There're a lot of NE for this game. For example, I,II,III simultaneously submit bids of, \$7 per click, \$9 per click, \$11 per click respectively. Their payoff will be $1 \times (16-0)$ dollars, $2\times (15-7)$ dollars, and $3 \times (14-9)$ dollars respectively. $$ \begin{array}{c|l|c|r} \hline &(0,7) & (7,9) & (9,11) & (11, +\infty)\\ \hline \text{player I}& \color{blue}{16} & \color{blue}{16} & 2(16-9)=14& 3(16-11)=15 \\ \hline \text{player II}& 15 & 2(15-7)=\color{blue}{16} & 2(15-7)=\color{blue}{16}& 3(15-11)=12 \\ \hline \text{player III}& 14 & 2(14-7)=14 & 3(14-9)= \color{blue}{15} & 3(14-9)= \color{blue}{15}\\ \hline \end{array} $$ How to find other NE? Added: I want to study this numerical example, because I want to understand better the motivation of this paper. 

The theory of present value states that the price of a stock is the discounted value of the infinite stream of future income of the company. Several countries have had very very low interest rates, very close to zero. Yet, stock prices have not gone to very very high values, or even infinity. Why is this the case? Is this a proof that the theory of present value is incorrect? Or maybe investors think companies will not last "forever" (which they cannot, as earth's lifespawn is finite)? 

The "common man" conception of money is not helpful to think about these issues. Money is not ONLY currency and notes anymore. These are just a TOKEN used to distribute goods and provide exchanges. They are not the real stuff. For example, when you make a bank account transfer, you are not moving TOKENS. Why would you? Banks are given these tokens by the central bank in order to keep a smooth movement of payments. So Apple does not have 80% of all tokens of the US economy in a vault somewhere. Why would they? It's dangerous! They have such ownership of wealth, but in the form of a current account and other assets. So you need to think differently between a claim on wealth, WHICH CAN BE TURNED INTO TOKENS, and the TOKENS THEMSELVES.
