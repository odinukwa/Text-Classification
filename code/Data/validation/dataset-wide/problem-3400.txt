I thought I would focus on one part of the original question, namely why this variation arises in the first place. The question presuppose that there is some unit that underlies pronunciations (I accept the presupposition). Using the term "phoneme" to refer to the segment in its underlying form, each phoneme is pronounced (realized, implemented, or whatever term you want to use) with a particular high-level acoustic and articulatory intent. The phonemes /t/ and /d/ in English call for raising the blade of the tongue in a certain manner, and they are distinguished by what happens at the larynx. However, it is extremely difficult to realize a phoneme in a very specific and identical manner in all contexts, owing to various physical forces of speech (articulatory, aerodynamic and acoustic factors). An aspect of articulation that plays a significant role in contextual variability of speech is coarticulation. In uttering the sequences {/ti/, /tu/, /tæ/, /pi/, /pu/, /pæ/}, the motor system faces the problem that in /ti/, there are two uses of connected articulators that have to be carefully orchestrated (involving positioning of the tongue blade), but in /pi/ the articulators for the vowel and consonant constrictions are different, and one does not constrain the other. Consequently in articulating /ti/ there is a physical necessity to adjust the articulations of /t/ and /i/ that does not exist in /pi/. The linguistic consequence of this is that there is a latent tendency to modify the pronunciation of /t/ in the direction of /i/, when /i/ follows. This tendency becomes linguistically interesting because the motor system only weakly pushes articulation in a particular direction, and speakers have to "decide" exactly how coarticulatory influences are implemented. One approach would be to let tongue raising and fronting for /i/ commence early, resulting in a palatal-sounding consonant [tʲ]. Another is to retard raising and fronting (in order to maintain the details of articulation for /t/), resulting in an initially-retracted vowel [ɨ̆i]. The initial impetus for contextual variation is this necessity of coordinating consecutive articulations in fluent speech. Languages can regulate automatic coarticulation in many ways, and this can lead to historical changes in the high-level acoustic and articulatory intent behind a given segment. So in some (Indic and Bantu) languages, the original goal of producing breathy voicing as a distinctive property of stops has been modified, to the point of becoming the goal of producing distinctive L tone on a following vowel. The interesting but unanswered question is, what causes languages to respond differently to that initial physical impetus? That is, why aren't allophonic rules the same in all languages? 

I suggest reading the Voice tutorial in Praat, which you will see a link to if you check help searching for "pulses". There is a display, 'pulses', which marks "voiced pulses". There are two kinds of things with "big amplitude", voiced sounds, and noisy (voiceless) release bursts. If you were dealing with clicks, those bursts would be really loud, but they are fairly short, so you basically want quasi-period high amplitude sections, plus (good luck with that...) not 60 cycle hum. You should expect there to be a few problems if you're dealing with English and you want to identify [g], because [g] especially can be phonetically voiceless. Apart from that, a pulse listing sounds like what you want. 

You could listen to the Tajik examples on Forvo, so that you can "experience" <Ӯ>. Be warned that many of the recordings are crappy, and the volume-swings from token to token can break your eardrums. This guy made some reasonable recordings. You can get Kazakh here. 

"First language" isn't exactly a well-defined technical term of linguistics, so it can be used literally, as the first language that you learned as a child. I know someone who started life speaking Polish, but the family moved to the US and his Polish kind of lapsed, so he's not really fluent. "Mother tongue" is likewise a problematic term since it can be used to mean "the language that my mother speaks", relevant in multi-ethnic communities where your ethnic identity comes from your father, but you also learn the language of your mother's side of the family. (This can lead to people thinking that they "can't speak their own language" if they don't become fluent in their father's language). We generally disregard ability to write as indicative of anything, since many languages in the world are not written, either at all or else very much (that is, there aren't any or many publications in the language and at most it's just written informally in letters to home). So if your first language were Gitonga you might speak that language better than English, but you might struggle with writing Gitonga and be better at writing in English, because you didn't have much experience with writing essays in Gitonga. Your description of the situation suggests to me that your "first language" is not English, but maybe you really are equally conversationally fluent in English and X. I take "most comfortable" to be a self-assessment of oral fluency (favoring X); now maybe you can decide what your "native" language is. 

The defined standard for cardinal vowels is the Jones performances. IPA is loosely related to Standard Cardinal Vowels, but the IPA letter < i > can be used for a wide range of phonetic values ranging from Cardinal Vowel 1 to something rather close to [ɪ]. "Accuracy" implies a standard (that is, what thing does the chart accurately reproduce?), and it isn't clear what standard you are interested in. I am inclined to think you mean "correctly reproduces Daniel Jones' tongue positions", but perhaps you mean "accurately reflects the vowels [i,u] etc. in English", or else in Spanish, or maybe Dresden German. What you would need to do is map the vowel dots in the x-rays to a coordinate system, using some fixed bony structure as a reference point such as the upper incisors and the palatine process). Unfortunately, the "interpretation" graphs don't scale well to the x-rays, though Interpretation 1 is the best of the three (the other two are schematizations, not drawings of x-rays). In the x-rays, the box that surrounds the extreme vowels [i,ɑ] is twice as long horizontally as it is high, but the box that contains the "vowel space" in picture I1 is only 1.25 times as long as it is high. In fact, I1 looks like Peter Ladefoged, and may be accurate as a representation of Peter Ladefoged. However, I1 is only a vowel space: it does not give specific points for vowel locations, so it does not at all represent the 4 tongue positions in the Jones x-rays. The other drawings are substantially off. So despite the fact that specific vowel positions are not given in I1, the schematized vowel space given there is at least consistent with where specific cardinal vowels are likely to be produced. 

The main problem that I see comes from viewing vowel marks as secondary, which in practice means that vowel marks are smaller and less visually distinct. If the language has a large vowel inventory this can be a problem. Another problem, which may be accidental and not inherent, is more complex rules for letter shape and positioning, as in the many ligatures of Devanagari or the multitude of positions for placing vowel signs, or the shape irregularities of Ge'ez script. If you were to invent a new abugida script, you could require complete contextual regularity of letter shapes, and positioning all vowels in a consistent position relative to the consonant. The resulting system would be pretty much ambiguous between "alphabet" and "abugida". 

I have different judgments on tu quoque and don't think I've ever heard [tu kwokwi] – I also have a different judgment on karaoke which I pronounce [karaoke], but I recognize that's not typical. You don't give any examples of Italian words, and the ones that come to mind (numerous food-related words like al dente, latte, farfalle, mafalde and artsy terms like andante, finale, sotto voce) are relatively recent or recherche ([e], not [i]). Older and more-established Italian words include minestrone, fettucine, linguine with [i], and of course often orthographic e is simply not pronounced in some words (belvedere, trombone). I think the high-vowel pronunciation of tagliatelle, rotelle is more standard in the US though I might use [e]. the ultimate sign of nativization or else Sicilian origin. If there is a tendency for Italian words to be pronounced with [e] compared to words from other languages, I think it is because Italian words are more recent, and there is a greater chance in the US of encountering an actual Italian pronunciation of the word to override the rule that orthographic e is not pronounced [e]. 

There are very many things remaining to do in historical linguistics. If you set aside certain language families which have been "mostly figured out", there are still very many areas in the world where our knowledge of language relations and especially reconstruction is, shall we say, less than ideal, especially in the New World. Plus, even in a family that is pretty well worked out like Bantu, there are unresolved details – for example, what, if any, system of vowel harmony did it have; aside from knowing what the tonal phonemes were and what roots had what tones, we don't really know what the proto-language did with those tones. There are also broader questions that are not just about reconstruction. For example, there are various sensible ideas about how sound changes like Grimm's Law come about, but the theory of sound change is pretty coarse-grained. Being able to substantiate and generalize these ideas will take quite a long time and will require an unprecedented level of observation. An example where the horse may be out of the barn is the development of the modal + "of" construction, from modal + "have". The change is far enough along that there are now people for whom the construction is "should of gone", which we can post-hoc rationalize as phonological reduction of "should have". Did this happen simultaneously at hundreds of locations? Did it get started once and spread? How does this relate to the "shoulda" alternative (is "should of" based on "shoulda", or vice versa, or are these independent changes)? Bacteria-model language splitting is the dominant theory of language relations, but of course nobody has ever denied the relevance of language contact, and I think that as contact-induced language changes are studies in greater detail, fundamental concepts of language relatedness are bound to change, at least in some cases (in particular, when there is significant contact, as in West Africa, but not so much in Oceanic).
