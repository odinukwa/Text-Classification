The Death Penalty Information Center also has a page with the costs of execution in different states, and while they are an organisation that apposes the death penalty they cite credible sources for their information. The counter argument to the cost is that the capital punishment is a moral choice that the American/each state's public wants and they are willing to pay the appropriate price, as cited in this article about the failure of prop 34 in California: 

Also, a Foreign Policy article on the campaign mentions another recent campaign, the "White Ribbon Campaign" which is part of the global White Ribbon Campaign against domestic violence: 

I don't feel that the videos and pictures show anything too shocking, but since this is dealing with death, and does show fires where you know bodies are burning, it may disturb some viewers. 

As well as personal experience from eating onions that were cut not on the same day. From the National Onion Association: 

This lengthy process is in place to minimize the number of innocent people that will get executed as well as making sure that the defendant/inmate has exhausted all possible legal options to prove their innocence. In China, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq (3 of the other 4 world "leaders" in executions in the year 2011, together with the US), it's easier, quicker and cheaper to execute a person: China:

Dolphins don't rape humans. Raping a human requires the dolphin to be able to physically subdue a human and taking of the human's clothes the lack of opposable thumbs and hands really make it hard. They can however "hump" a human and conduct in a way that if was made by another human being would constitute sexual harassment and molestation. Here are two videos as example: A dolphin with an errection shoving it's snout to a woman's crouch: $URL$ A dolphin dry humping a visitor in a water park: $URL$ All the claims about dolphins raping humans, seem to be from this source which includes as its sources this picture: dolphin rape $URL$ which is obviously a very bad Photoshop. They also mention Scott Randleston of the Dolphin Research Institute of Boca Raton as a source, the website for the institute doesn't mention Scott Randleston, and searching for his name just brings up this claim repeating. This behavior is not limited only to humans, or even living creatures, as mentioned In this article by Jean-Pierre Sylvestre: 

Prolactin is the stress hormone (as mentioned in Mad Scientist's answer). There is some question as to whether crying is always beneficial for all people, though. 

You're right to be suspicious. While there are obviously studies of "body language", it's impossible to judge accurately from one photograph, or even a short video, how someone is genuinely feeling. Especially to the degree that you describe: Is a person genuinely having a good time, or are they posing for the cameras? Even if that person wasn't having a good time, it's impossible to say why, without asking them. Think of it as someone taking a photograph of your face in mid conversation. You may look serious as you listen to what someone is saying. You may laugh if they say something funny. But could anyone really accurately state what your feelings were about the situation? In short: It's impossible to say with certainty what someone is feeling by their body language. Reference: The Truth Behind the Smile and Other Myths - When Body Language Lies, Harvard, 2002 

While it's technically true that Firefly was cancelled due to low ratings, it's also true that FOX were not behind the show, or as Joss Whedon put it: 

Obviously the music industry has gone to great lengths to try and ingrain the message that illegal downloads of music have significantly damaged their bottom line, but is there any irrefutable evidence that declines in sales for major labels are as a direct result of illegal downloads? For example, growth in other media (such as video games) will have obviously eaten into the amount of money available teenagers have to spend on music. Also, the prevalence of the internet means that distribution is cheap and affordable for even smaller labels now (meaning there's less reason for artists to jump to bigger labels). I ask especially in regard to today's marketplace, where there are plenty of online stores making music available to legally download (such as iTunes, Zune Marketplace, and eMusic). 

The 10% figure comes from (*drumroll*) Alfred Kinsey... Or rather, it originated in his book, Sexual Behavior in the Human Male. Does this mean that 10% of the population is homosexual? No, it means that, of the 5300 white males polled by Kinsey and his peers, 10% answered that they were predominately homosexual. That's all. Different polls and different sources have their own figures. For example, a 1993 Janus Report estimated that 9% of men, and 5% of women, had more than "occasional" homosexual relationships. While The Family Research Report says "around 2-3% of men, and 2% of women, are homosexual or bisexual." And The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force estimates 3-8% of both sexes. One of the biggest issues comes from agreeing on a definition. As someone pointed out in the comments, it's hard to establish exactly what "homosexual" actually means. For example, if a man lives and dies, and had one homosexual experienced during his lifetime: Was he gay, bisexual or straight? Whatever category you'd place that man into, Kinsey's reports indicate that roughly 37% of men would fall into it. So it all depends how you classify sexuality. And to make matters even more confusing, some (like the Canadia based Centre for Addiction and Mental Health) suggest "sexual orientation may be fluid and change over time". So even if someone identifies with being straight at one point in their lives, at another point they may naturally find themselves identifying with homosexuality. In short: There's no definite, conclusive answer. Sources:

It's very hard to say what is the cause of the bunny's situation, however, it's a somewhat common phenomenon, which is caused mainly by mutilation and not genetic defects. An NBC news article from 2011 cites University of Miami biologist Dana Krempels, and rabbit expert on the issue: 

And there are some some studies, all show that there can be and is correlation between churchgoing and religiosity and a person's health: Is going to church good or bad for you? Denomination, attendance and mental health of children in West Scotland Is Church Attendance Associated With Latinas' Health Practices and Self-reported Health? In conclusion: Like every aspect of human life, churchgoing and religion may have affect on our health, but the mechanism behind it, the reasons and what aspects of our health are affected are still unknown, and require much more high quality research. All the study that available today, don't try to explain the phenomenon only to describe it. A serious study, which will be able to make the right differentiation of the elements that are unique to religion and churchgoing, is still needed, and until it's done, we can't say what is the aspect of this particular activity that has affect on us. 

In Israel, the patties for McDonald's are made by a company named Of Tov which literally translates as "Good Chicken", in their site they still say that their patties are made from 100% lean beef meat. 

Electricity doesn't move at the speed of light, only light (photons) moves at the speed of light, and the speed of light changes in different materials. This is the only point where I agree with the source. While electrons move at very high speeds, the "current" is their drift speed, which is much slower (I don't know if they are right as to the speed is several cm per sec, but it changes with the magnitude of the applied field, so obviously, the current speed will change, whether you apply 1.5V of 1e5V on the conductor). If there is a text book saying that electrons move at speeds close to the speed of light without saying that the current doesn't flow at that speed, than that textbook is wrong. Explanation on drift speed vs. speed: Electrons move in random directions in very high speeds. When we talk about the current speed, we are talking about drift speed. The electron moves in different random directions inside the material, then collides with another particle, loses all it's speed and starts moving in a new random direction. When an electric field is applied, then the electron will move slightly more to a single direction, and thus drift in that direction. This is also why the current speed and not acceleration is relative to the force applied. A good video explaining this subject Final conclusion: What we have here is a post (and I would even go so far as call it a rant) that kids smaller than 14 aren't taught university undergraduate and graduate level physics, with all the fine nuances. While in some cases the source may have merit and a viable point if it was addressing that non-physics students (like EE, CS, MEC and others) are taught over simplified physics, the source doesn't address them, but, instead addresses small children in elementary school. Even if to claim that this is addressed to grown people who don't work at physics related jobs, or have physics related occupations would be, it would still be way too petty, as people who don't need the exact details, could be left very well with a basic understanding of the subject. You can't explain physics at the level that the source demands without a lot of time being spent at explaining and learning all the subjects that are needed for a full and real understanding, including high level math, basic (university basic = high-school advanced) chemistry, and the physics that is at the core of those laws, including, particle physics, relativity theory, quantum mechanics, statistical physics, thermodynamics, EM theory and maybe even more, go to any college or university web site, look at the list of courses needed to be taken by students before they take the solid state physics course, this all you need to know to understand, why certain particles can conduct in certain material and other in other materials. Because a full explanation is a very very very long and hard explanation, it's better to leave people and especially kids with some basic knowledge of the principals behind the phenomenons that they see every day, than to leave then with no explanation at all. You can see from the source material at the undergraduate level that I provide here, that all those nuances and fine details are taught to students that learn the subject at the university, and that there isn't a fear of a physicist who thinks that protons don't have a charge associated with them. Sources for other subjects touched on here: Particle physics: No course book, but you can see a full Stanford course on this subject on You Tube Semiconductors and Solid State Physics: Solid State Physics /Ashcroft & Mermin *- Electromagnetic theory also knows to deal with magnetic currents, i.e. the displacement of magnetic charge. But since magnetic charge carriers were never found in nature, this is a purely theoretical aspect of the EM theory. 

This (very compelling) lecture by Robert H. Lustig (MD, UCSF Professor of Pediatrics in the Division of Endocrinology) backs up the idea that Type 2 diabetes can be reversed by changes in diet, but the focus is on increase roughage (and exercise) and reducing refined sugar. I believe he makes reference to several studies. $URL$ You'll note it has nothing to do with the magical power of raw vegetables, just the vast increase in fibre intake which helps the body deal with sugar better (and other simple health changes). This BBC news article, also backs up the same understanding: $URL$ 

Race is one of the most misunderstood words in the English language. It literally refers to any genetically passed traits that are shared within a group. This can include skin-colour, but it also includes hair colour, freckles, even nationality. In other words, any shared genetic traits mean you share the same "race" as someone. As you can imagine, this makes the term rather meaningless for lots of reasons. For example, because of the huge amount of genetic diversity in Africa, two people from two different African nations will have less in common, genetically, than a European and someone from an African nation. And yet the average person would most likely guess it was the other way around. Perhaps because humans are very visually orientated, however, we have now becomes fixated on skin-colour, and using that to define "race". Unfortunately people don't understand that there is little or no biological basis for any other traits, beyond skin colour. For example, The gene for skin-colour has no relation to things like musical ability, eye shape, athletic ability, etc. Genetic traits are measurable, and often have other effects on a person (blonde people are more likely to have fairer skin, and so get sunburned more easily, etc), but other traits are stored in completely different areas of the human genome. A good way to look at it is to remember that skin colour is as biologically significant as hair colour or eye colour. The biggest mistake is thinking that "race" means something more significant about someone more than just "shared genetic history". Until people understand that the difference between a black person and a white person is as biologically significant as someone who has freckles and someone who doesn't, common misunderstandings about the importance of race are likely to continue. Most people don't even understand that "French" people are a race, for example, and I've even been "corrected" by people using it in that way! In short: So much talk about "race" has placed far too much emphasis on the word, as if it means something significant. It doesn't. Sources:
