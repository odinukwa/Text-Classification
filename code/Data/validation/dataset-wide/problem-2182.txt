You were self employed. The fact that small business X had an official start date that you registered with the government is irrelevant. Put the entire time you spent deciding what to do and assign it to the small business. Don't feel that you had a gap. If you want to stress the business development process you could say you has three jobs that overlapped: business development, the small business and your freelancing work. 

Keep in mind they may have a contractual obligation to a customer and can get penalized if the position is not filled. Sometimes they can make more money having you sit at a desk those last few days because they can charge the customer. 

The phone number on the resume is jut one way to contact you. In many cases the key information, other than a phone interview, will be done via email. 

If everybody rejected job offers because they believed that a recommendation helped get them a position then: 

In the United States you should keep the end of year one, it has all the information on that will appear on the W-2 plus additional company related information like vacation balance. Keep the end of year, or end of job ones with your annual tax forms. During the year it is OK to keep them all and then destroy all but the end of year or end of job ones during tax prep time. It is a good idea to review them when they are received to make sure that the pay and deductions match what you expect. I have known people who didn't review the slips periodically and never noticed that the company was withholding taxes for the wrong state. Follow the IRS guidance for keeping tax forms. 

Don't reject the tentative offer before you have to. Keep the potential offer alive by performing all the pre-employment tasks. But keep applying for other positions, keep interviewing when asked. Rejecting a valid offer generally makes the unemployment benefits come to a halt. Rejecting an offer, by telling the company that you are no longer interested due to unreasonable delays, is something you can afford to do when you have a stable job you want to leave, but are in no hurry to do so. Rejecting the offer in that case doesn't lead to loss of income. Rejecting an offer due to delays when you are unemployed doesn't seem to make sense. 

They might be a third party recruiter, and are competing with other recruiters for filling the position. If they provide too many details, before they collect information from you, they risk that you will be able to find the real job posting on their clients website. If you register on the client site they miss an opportunity to collect the fee. If they get your vitals and send it to the client they can claim that they provided a valid candidate. 

Some companies have a program of matching funds contributed to charities. They might have a maximum amount they will match for each employee. Some will also send funds to a charity based on volunteer hours contributed by the employee. If HR has a produce for donations to charities they should have a reference to it on the HR website or the employee manual. The company may also have a community outreach department, since they frequently use some of these donations/sponsorships to show that they are a contributing member of their communities. If the company is spread over many parts of the country they may even have a fund to be used by local offices, as a part of advertising. The company will generally want to approve the charity before donating or matching funds to make sure that the charity is real and the employee is not getting a benefit. Unless the company is very small, it would not be wise to start with the CEO. 

If you are on the clock, then I don't see how you can own it. In addition you are using their hardware and resources. In many companies you would get fired for using company resources for private gain or to run your outside company. 

They want to hire a w2 position; they don't want to send a 1099 to a consulting company who then gives you a W2. So, no. Example: Bob's programmers want to hire an employee. So they advertise on a job board they include the line: "candidates need to be able to work on a W2 basis" Bob's programmers doesn't want a contract with we_are_coders. If you aren't willing to quit we_are_coders and become an employee of Bob's programmers, then don't apply. 

The issue is that you work for a company that has setup their 401K retirement program with automatic enrollment. To stop the process from starting or to end the automatic deductions they need you to fill out a form. Many companies refer to you either by employee number or by social security number. Your employer does have social security number due to their payroll requirements. The company running the 401k generally needs a taxid number for every account. This goes for IRA accounts, 401k accounts and non-retirement accounts. Your name on the form is not good enough, the company running the 401K may need to be able to document your declining. They may even have to refund your initial contributions in some cases. Your employer and their payroll processor needs to turn off the deduction. Your employer may need to prove to the feds that every employee was initially enrolled in the retirement program but some declined. Keep in mind that HR can just add your SSN and pass it to the 401K company. If your work for a small company your name alone may be enough for HR to 100% identify you. For a large company they will need your employee ID number. Of course it might delay the stopping for a paycheck or two. 

It is not unusual for people to take a less advanced position for that second job. I have know people to work weekends or nights in a blue collar job, while having a full time position that was professional. If the part-time employer understands why: earning extra money; they are less worried that you are ready to quit once a better job comes along. They realize you may be picking that job based on hours available to work, or distance from home, or relevance to a hobby or even your full-time job. There is no need to dumb down the resume, the reason why can be addressed in the cover letter. You might be required to tell your full-time employer about your job search. Some companies worry about conflict of interest. You will have to review your documents from HR, or even ask HR.
