In Hofer & Zehnder's book "Symplectic Invariants and Hamiltonian Dynamics" (Page 99) they present an example of a star shaped domain (bounded, with smooth boundary) in the shape of a "Bordeaux bottle" which is not symplectomorphic to a convex domain. In similar spirit, I ask, is there an open bounded contractible domain $A\subset\mathbb R^{2n}$ with $\partial A$ smooth, such that $A$ is not symplectomorphic to a star shaped domain? Thanks 

I often hear that the regular simplex is "the least" symmetric convex body, and I've heard that there are some measures of symmetry of a body, that the simplex minimizes. Could you please explain or refer me to what methods / measurements there are that measure a convex body's symmetry? I'll give some context - I have some function on convex bodies and I want to run a computer simulation to find which polytopes with volume 1 and k vertices minimize this functional. It is conjectured that of all bodies of volume 1 a ball will minimize, and I want to gather evidence for or against this conjecture. I'll have to measure symmetry and/or maybe, how close to ellipsoid-like shape a convex polytope is. Thanks 

Hello, I'd like to hear your opinion for ergodic theory books which would suit a beginner (with background in measure theory, real analysis and topological groups). I am looking for something well structured, well motivated, and perhaps with application to other fields. any such book exists? I tried a book by nadkarni, and could not read through it, seemed to concise to me, and tried the book by Petersen which I felt was accessible but didn't follow a clear path, jumping from subject to subject with lots of different object or properties. What are your recommendations on the subject? 

Is there an example of a simply connected contact manifold W, with a non exact symplectic filling $M_1$, (that is, $M_1$ is a symplectic manifold, with contact boundary $W$ and a Liouville vector field defined in a neighborhood of $W$ pointing outward, transversally), and a symplectic capping $M_2$, (that is, $M_2$ is a symplectic manifold, with contact boundary $W$ and a Liouville vector field defined in a neighborhood of $W$ pointing inward, transversally), such that $M_1 \cup M_2$ is a symplectically aspherical manifold (that is, $\omega$ vanishes on $\pi_2$). So far I managed to find in the literature that every symplectically aspherical filling of $(S^{2n-1},\xi_{std})$, is diffeomorphic to a ball [Eliashberg-Floer-McDuff], therefore exact, so $W$ in question must be more complicated than that. Thanks 

Hello, in G. Mikhalkin's Papaer "DECOMPOSITION INTO PAIRS-OF-PANTS FOR COMPLEX ALGEBRAIC HYPERSURFACES": $URL$ There is a lemma about the relation between intersection of a hypersurface with the boundary divisors in a toric variety and the truncation of the defining polynomial of a hypersurface to some face of the newton polytope. (Lemma 2.20. Page 15). The lemma basically says that If we take a hypersurface with newton polytope P, and consider it's closure in the projective toric variery corresponding the the lattice polytope P, then to find it's intersection with the boundary divisors, it is enough to truncate the polynomial the the corresponding face of the newton polytope and take the zeroes of the truncated polynomial. The proof given there is a one-liner about the order of vanishing of some monomials and I don't understand why it proves the claim. I would appreciate if someone could explain this to me. Thank you 

I've been reading some papers in Symplectic Geometry which refer to something called "Stretching the neck", and give reference to Eliashberg, Givental and Hofer's SFT paper ($URL$ I ran a search after the words "neck" and "stretch" and they do not appear in the paper, I guess the theory is there under a different name. Since it's a long and complicated paper and I just want to understand the general idea and results of this "neck stretching" so I can continue reading those other papers i'm currently reading, Could someone please refer me to the part in the the SFT paper which deals with neck stretching? or alternatively, refer me to some other paper/survey/someone's thesis/book in which it is clearly explained? Thank you 

I know that many symplectic geometers are interested in quantization as well. From what I understood, quantization isn't expected to be used as a tool to answer symplectic questions (as in translating the problem to the quantum world, solve it there, and somehow go back), unlike the relation, for example between complex geometry and tropical geometry. Rather, it is supposed to be interesting and have appeal for reasons intrinsic to quantization. As a person whose main interests are symplectic geometry, topology and algebraic geometry, why study quantization? What aspects or problems there may I find appealing? For those who approach mathematics from the physics realm, I guess the answer is straightforward, as those ways of quantizing symplectic manifolds are attemps at formalization of some physical theories and beliefs. I am looking for a more mathematically oriented answer, since I personally derive my interest and motivation from the intrinsic beauty of mathematics. Thanks 

Consider a symplectic manifold $(M,\omega)$ of dimension $2n$ (closed or open with bounded geometry). Let $L\subset M$ be a compact Lagrangian submanifold (not necessarily connected). Consider two regular $\omega$-compatible almost complex structures $J_0,J_1$. Denote by $(\Sigma,j)$ a given Riemann surface with boundary. (In my specific application ($\Sigma,j_r$) is a cylinder, with $j_r$ an integrable complex structure corresponding to identification with an annulus in $\mathbb C$ of radii $1$ and $r$.) Let $u_0:(\Sigma,\partial\Sigma) \to (M,L)$ a simple (not multiply covered) $J_0$-holomorphic curve, with boundary on the Lagrangian $L$. I want to choose a path of compatible almost complex structures (or tame, if impossible to do for compatible ones), $J_t$ between $J_0$ and $J_1$ such that $u_0$ extends to a family of maps $u_t \colon (\Sigma,\partial\Sigma, j_t) \to (M,L,J_t)$ for $t\in[0,t^*)$ and such that if bubbling occurs at time $t^*$ then it is of a type lying on a strata of codimension-1 in the Deligne-Mumford compactifiction. i.e. either a single disc bubble, or a simple degeneration of $j_t$ (in the cylinder example, the radius $r$ going to $\infty$ or $1$, etc'. What I would like to eliminate is a whole bubble tree popping out the instant we hit $t^*$. I want the bubbles to appear "one by one", which would reduce my analysis to a finite number of options. Is such thing possible? if impossible in general dimension, can this be done in $dim M = 4$? (If possible to do for codimenstion 2 instead of 1, or actually any fixed codimension, this might also help me) Thank you in advance! 

Hello all. Let's say we have a one parameter (complex) family of complex curves on a family of corresponding surfaces. i.e, think of the whole thing living inside some threefold, fibered along corresponding surfaces. Let's look on the central fiber, we have a curve $C_0$ on a surface, and assume we have some isolated singularity there at point $z$ . pick a small closed ball around the singularity. Topologically $\(C_0 \cap B_z \)$ is a bouquet of discs. now, lets vary the parameter and look what happens to this fragment of the curve. Look at the Normalization of $\(C_t \cap B_z \)$. it's a collection of surfaces with some holes and handles. I want to compare the Euler Characteristic of this normalization with the Euler Characteristic of the normalization of the corresponding fragment of the central fiber, $C_0$. Let's say I know that the Euler Characteristic (Topological) has changed in the deformation by at most 2. Now what can it mean? Either some branches joined by a handle. or we could have added holes. EDIT: (by a handle I mean a tube, topologically $S^1\times\[0,1\]$ joining the two branches, like in the deformation $x^2 + y^2 = t$ : for $t=0$ we have bouquet of two discs and the normalization separates them to two disjoint discs, and for $t\ne0$ they join by a handle). It still decreases Euler Characteristic by 2 because it cuts out two small discs) I find it hard to understand what does adding holes mean, or even whether it is entirely possible that holes add up in the deformation. can the Euler characteristic jump at an increment of 1 and not 2 (adding 1 hole)? Can I get two holes instead of a handle? and at what conditions of the arrangement of branches of the central fiber? I hope I made my question clear, If not, please tell me and I'll try to explain better. for now, that's the best I could do, well... since this whole thing is not very clear to me, It's also hard to be fluent and precise when asking the question. Thank you all in advance
