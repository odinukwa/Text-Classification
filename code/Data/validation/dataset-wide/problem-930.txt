Paper remains fundamental to our finance - it proves what we bought, what we own. Some money is even made of paper. And in the modern age, money is the surest route to power, while the amount each of us has exerts enormous power over our lives. 

"Paper Doll" is of course a children's toy, not something for a responsible adult. Furthermore it's a toy particularly associated with girls rather than boys, especially as they grow older. And paper is weak, easily torn, not like a tough man should be. There is a further implication on class and education here, since paper is associated on multiple levels with reading, writing and academia which, in Eddie's world view, should not be things of interest to a working man. "Blondie" is a feminine name with further feminine implications. Men should not be interested in the colour of their hair. Blonde is not a description usually applied to men, with something like fair-headed being used instead. Blonde women are associated with a stereotype of being ditzy, stupid and unreliable. 

I have not been able to source a quote from the author, but there is an interview which offers some circumstantial evidence that Crowley is indeed named after the famous Occultist. Actor Mark Sheppard played a character called Crowley in the TV series Supernatural. There is a common presumption among fans of that show that the character was inspired by Crowley from Good Omens. In an interview, Sheppard claims to have met Neil Gaiman, who rebuffed the claim. Of more relevance to the question is this quote: 

These two conceptions of birth foreshadow the ending of the novel. First, the Pequod is sucked down into a womb-like vortex, entombed in the sea. This is the disastrous consequence of Ahab's warped, masculine "birthing" of his obsession. 

Then the feminine ship Rachel arrives, like a new mother, to rescue the survivors, including Ishmael. 

Yeats was Irish, and in literal terms this is a reference to the Irish Catholic funeral custom of a Wake. "Blinds" here refers to a window-covering. In Yeats' era, wooden shutters, sometimes known as blinds, were commonly used to shut out light instead of curtains. Covering windows to signify a death is a practice which dates back to Victorian times, both ensuring privacy for the mourning family and a notice to possible visitors that a death has occurred inside the house. A Wake is an extension of this mourning, during which mourners spend a night in the house with the corpse. Although sombre, attendees at a Wake often do their best to celebrate the life of the deceased: there will be food and alcohol and sometimes music and dance. Hence the lines: 

I can think of many reasons why a list or two might suit this chapter. The chosen names may be illuminating to more erudite readers than I. It may be a pastiche in and of itself of the list-motif in Irish myth, given that nationalism is a theme of the chapter. It may be mocking the portentous nature of those who like to write lists. None of these, however, seem to explain the use of lists as a repeating motif. Almost a lists of lists, if you will. What does this motif signify? 

Just William is an enduring series of stories about an errant schoolboy from a solidly upper-middle class family in Edwardian England. Due to their subject and humorous nature they are typically perceived as children's literature. However, it is quite common online to find claims that their author, Richmal Crompton, originally intended them for an adult audience. There is some circumstantial evidence for this: she also wrote a lot of adult literature and the density of language in the stories is beyond most children at William's 11-12 years of age. On investigation, I cannot find any solid evidence to support this supposition. Did Crompton intend the stories for an adult audience? 

At first glance, these feel like two different poems. The first is an ethereal description of the terror of being involved in a car crash. The second reads like a plea for quiet and solitude in an overcrowded world. Where is the connection? The key is in the second stanza of the first part: 

(Massive spoilers on the book follow). Toward the end of Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell, a nameless character appears before Childermass and performs various feats of magic, including bringing Vinculus back to life. He then vanishes and is not mentioned again. I had always presumed this nameless character was John Uskglass, the Raven King. But the episode has always bothered me because I can't understand its significance. It adds nothing to the plot - Vinculus being raised by "unknown forces" would have served just as well - and feels like a nagging loose end introduced to no great purpose. Given the literary skill exhibited in other aspects of the novel's construction, I doubt that this is true. So: is the nameless magician John Uskglass? And what is the significance of his reappearance in terms of the novel's themes and story? 

The stranger is an associate of Magwitch. I have no particular evidence to support this, beyond commonly accepted interpretations of the text, which are based on a series of circumstancial observations. First, the stranger has Magwitch's file. Pip is certain that it is the same file and the stranger shows it to Pip in a semi-secretive manner, using it to stir his drink, demonstrating this information is to be kept from the others. This suggests the stranger - like Magwitch - may also be in trouble with the law. Therefore we know that the stranger is associated in some way with Magwitch. Second is what the stranger gives to Pip: a shilling wrapped in paper which later turns out to be two pound-notes. This is a fairly substantial sum of money at the time the book was set, equivalent to about Â£180 today. Certainly more than a lad like Pip would likely have. From this we infer that the money is supposed to be seen as a reward from Magwitch to Pip to aid in his rescue. In the absence of any additional information, and the presumption that Dickens put it in there for a reason, the only conclusion we can reach is that this is some friend or associate of Magwitch from the crimibal underworld. What, then, is the reason for this slightly confusing scene? It serves two purposes. The first is a foreshadow of the plot to come. It demonstrates that Magwitch now has means enough to spare a fair sum of money to Pip and that he is a generous man who feels deep gratitude for Pip's aid. The second is to highlight what Pip has learned about the British class system and how that system corrupts people. As an innocent boy, Pip saw only a man in trouble and desired to help. Now he is older and wiser, he has learned to see convicts as dangerous rather than desparate and he fears them. He has nightmares about the file. Or perhaps what he fears is more the effect that associating with them might have on his newly-revealed chances of rising through the class system. 

Why is this relevant to the quoted work, Crow Hears Fate Knock on the Door? If the Crow poems are a meditation on Christianity, then a key aspect of this exploration is contrasting the instinctual religious impulse with the modern desire for rationality, for evidence and experimentation. There are examples all through the cycle, but let's quote one from Hears Fate: 

The Roving Gambler is the name of a traditional Blues song which Dylan has himself covered. It's also worth noting that one of the themes of the song seems to be a critique of American capitalism. There are several places one could draw this allusion, but in particular verse three. 

To understand this, once needs to know a little Irish history. Essentially Ireland has been an island riven by violence almost continually for over a thousand years. First it was the Vikings, raiding, pillaging and settling. Then it was the Normans followed by the Tudors who, through the reformation, then lead a bloody, divisive series of religious wars which sucked in people from all over the United Kingdom. The repercussions of this are still being felt today and were very much in evidence at the time that Ulysses was written. This is the "nightmare" of Ireland's history. How Stephen frames his statement is purposefully cryptic: it's possible that it's meant to be one of those things which sounds quite profound but is in fact relatively meaningless. He is a teacher, and clearly a clever and well-learned one at that. However, during the scene where he utters this phrase he's been cornered by Mr. Deasy, the headmaster who, although an authority figure, seems far less imaginative than Stephen. Deasy is trying to reverse roles and place Stephen in the role of the pupil in order to press his authority: Stephen resents this and says a number of cryptic things to Deasy apparently with the purpose of confusing him.
