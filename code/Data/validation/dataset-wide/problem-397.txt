If you bring enough wealth with you people will let you do almost anything. If you want something that is cheaper in your own time... Metals like steel, aluminum made into weapons or armor better than theirs. Glass, mirrors or plastics. Spices and seeds. Some electronics? Any electronics must be powered by solar or wind up. Torches or long range radio communications would be useful. knowledge of races or other contests could let you bet your way to success. Once you have a fortune buy a workshop, work out exactly how to make something (bring relevant info) then show it to top craftsmen and invite them round to show them what you did. 

The sun's larger mass makes it much brighter and also causes the earth to spiral inwards. In short you don't have that long to move away. The largest stars, those around 100 solar masses, can last as little as several hundred thousand years. $URL$ At this mass, the earth will be scorched in days as it falls inwards. If the whitehole can't add mass at a rate of 100 solar masses per day, then its rate is the main factor. In short you don't move the earth, most of it is useless rock and the energy needed would melt the surface. Much better to pack up the important bits, and leave, now. (the important bits could be all buildings, all life and most of the soil or just a hundred humans with the bare minimum tech needed to live) 

We are intelligent because in order to reproduce this way we needed to find and convince our pairs that we are the right ones. And because we got more intelligent, we were able to choose more ideal mates. Also heterogamy results in a much much wider biodiversity(Without this you usually* don't get any biodiversity at all.) The way you could achieve your goals is through controlled mutations/biological engineering, which could produce sufficient biodiversity for survival and perhaps even more. If you choose biological engineering it would be very hard to get to that point without mutations or heterogamy. Controlled mutations could be on the other hand an alternative evolutionary way, tough its hard to reason how and why would such a thing win against heterogamy. 

You could argue, that outside the solar system there is too much radiation and for the travel you need better protection from that. The magnetic field of the sun provides you that. It doesn't have to be exactly radiation, but we still don't know too much about interstellar space, so there might be some handwavium that prevents your unobtanium from working there. This also gives you nice "Currently teleportation isn't working" options from solar rays and the such. 

The invention of Magic The "technology" could be magic. Lets say the dwarf miners of Alaton have found deep in their mines a new resource, which has strange affects on people. After not too much experimentation they found that this new resource could be used to practice "magic": Ability to control the flow of power and the elements with your mind. After realizing how the dragons must have gotten their power too, the adventurous type gotten themselves some of this new "mana" and set out to fight the dragons with their own powers. Because dragons are immensely powerful, this is very risky, and mana is scarce, and because of this not everyone can become a dragon hunter. The best warriors and magi are being chosen by the council and given mana for dungeon raids, and in turn they come back with the goods the dragons have stolen over the centuries. Or don't come back at all. 

Wipe out the microbes Another way of considering the situation is that if you have a spaceship large enough to move hundreds of humans and going at say 0.01c then the energy released by the retro rockets slowing down is easily enough to cook the surface, killing off any life in the process. (If aimed at the planet) Even without this there are other ways to wipe out unfriendly microbes. Places in the universe where you can survive without a spacesuit (or at least breathing equipment) will be few and far between. 

Assumptions As carbon and water are very common, and have a complex chemistry, we will assume that the aliens are carbon and water based. The aliens evolved, as opposed to being designed by other aliens. The aliens are intelligent and developing tech. The aliens are not technologically advanced enough to modify their biology. Deductions The aliens intelligence requires some organ to store and process data. While the human brain is far from the theoretical limits of computing, it would be hard for a biological system to be much smaller or more efficient. (in the same way that cheetahs are far slower than light the ultimate speed limit, but biology can't go much faster) So the aliens could be a bit smaller than us up to elephant or so. The aliens can't be arbitrarily big because of ... to be continued 

All of these scenarios require a large pile of woolly thinking, or at least some startling coincidences to happen. If you can get to another planet, you have tech more advanced than ours, if you can get to another solar system then your tech is far more advanced. A colony on another world will almost certainly need advanced technology to survive, like space suits, unless the world is almost identical to earth. Ether this is made locally or it is shipped in. If high tech resources are shipped in from earth, then you are a small outpost of a thriving world, otherwise you have set up your own high tech society. It is possible that radio noise could force you to use fiber optics not wireless, or that a shortage of uranium makes fission unusable, but overall tech levels are unchanged. If we are lucky enough to find an exceptionally habitable planet around a nearby star, we wouldn't have good reason to consider it habitable until we sent probes there. We can tell its the right temperature and as breathable air; but toxic spores, global oceans, or nothing edible are all likely options. Furthermore what technologies are required to send such an interstellar voyage. Sending such a craft at relativistic speed requires vast amounts of energy, warping space into wormholes requires even more. If you have that sort of energy then growing food with lots of bulbs, sending cargo around within a solar system or mining and refining large amounts of rock take trivial amounts in comparison. You also have advanced life support and recycling systems to support the crew for the voyage. Faced with these technologies we would be capable of setting up a large industrial base on mars, and survive any event short of a major collision on earth. (Any event that doesn't boil the oceans and melt the crust should be survivable in a well equipped bunker or sub.) Therefor we only need to go interstellar for survival when faced with something that will trash the entire solar system, like a rouge black hole. Even in this scenario it may be wiser to pull over to an asteroid and start mining when you arrive in a new star system. The only circumstances in which this makes any sense is if a manned capsule is bolted on to an interstellar probe in a last desperate attempt to survive after the black hole is found days away, no significant planing, just YOU, MOVE, NOW. Then you need some critical component in the air system to fail just as they reach the planet (no spares or fixes), leaving them a choice of bail or suffocate. In short we will not have to rebuild tech on an alien world unless a series of flukes forces us down the narrow line between fine and dead. 

Vesta Composition: These meteorites are believed to be debris ejected from Vesta as a result of an ancient collision. Presuming they are from Vesta, we have a good idea of what the crust of Vesta is made of. The surface seems to be mostly basalt and other igneous rocks, which means it is quite boring but also quite uniform and solid. Vesta Geology: Because of the above rocks(and other observations), it is thought that Vesta formed much like the terrestrial planets, and has a solid and cool core/mantle, and a crust that is 10km thick. This means that the surface of Vesta should be stable, solid, and have plenty of room to bore into. 

There are many possible answers, because not all animal social cues are the same, and not all human social cues are the same. The biggest thing that an animal-turned-human would have to overcome is that it is sapient, i.e. it has wisdom and self-awareness. Homo Sapiens translates to 'wise man' for a reason. If an animal became a human then it would first have to deal with the fact that every other human is also self-aware and that every action they perform has an effect on the world, something which humans begin to understand around the age of 2-4. However, in the case of these animals being aware enough to want to try imitating a human, we can assume they got past this barrier. Now the answer breaks into many, many options, because of the differences within animal and human societies, let alone the differences between them. From the perspective of a western-society, here are some potential issues: -Small talk: "How's it going?" "Good, you?" "Good". There are standard questions, statements, etc. that we say when we see someone. Sincerely answering back at length would be odd. -Food: Humans know how food works, and we can store food for when we need it. If you start eating as much as you as soon as you see food because you instinctively don't know when your next meal will be, it definitely will seem odd. -Possession: They may understand that entering someone's house is like roaming into their territory(though it is weird that humans don't pee on their doors), however knowing that objects outside of their territory is owned by them could lead to weird behavior. Additional problems will rise since they won't expect people outside of the humans pack(the police) to defend the human's property rights. -Money: A completely foreign concept to an animal. They will likely be caught stealing often. 

Could a computer make all the decisions associated with government. Trivially yes, making decisions is easy, making good decisions is harder. Could it run a vaguely competent government, or an amazingly efficient one? In principle yes, advanced computers could make brilliant decisions. Computer science isn't really there yet unless you offload tough decisions by hiring contractors or running referendums. Would people respect it as a legitimate government and pay their taxes, probably not but it depends on how it comes about and how good it is. 

How Long? There have been many questions about how long humans can survive under various conditions. These range from the atmosphere being removed to an increase in gravity. However this question is asking how long humans can survive from now as the world is. Some definitions. Humanity is granted a bit of luck in surviving as long as possible without any implausible or contrived coincidences. At least one creature that is biologically human must exist. (Closer to humans than Neanderthals are) Consider Evolution, Genetic upgrading and Apocalyptic events. Humans are not expected to instantly see the error of their ways and unite in common harmony. EDIT Current earth is the starting condition. Humans are still evolving and progress towards genetic modification and artificial intelligence is very fast. 

No this evil would not work The reason is quite simple. There is no clear way to kill off that many people in a controllable, unavoidable manner. Nukes kill those in the city that was nuked and damage everything. Poison gases have much the same effect of random death and environmental destruction but damage machinery less. Super diseases are indiscriminate, beyond our current technology, and can be avoided with hygiene precautions. ( and some people will be immune) Billions of drones can be shot down and will run out of power. The weapons will be stopped by thick concrete or rock. They are ineffective in caves and forests. None of these options and no others I can think of remotely fit your specifications. Nor could they be planned without people noticing. The plan can't be kept secrete until it is too late. Therefore there will exist security agencies that know about this. The result is an all out war against the planners in which both sides suffer and the planners are outnumbered 9 to 1. ( If the planners are that organized and hard to stop. They sound like a bunch of nutters with no hope of doing any damage. ) 

Unfortunately no, you can't replace an element of the periodic table because the ordering of the elements on the periodic table are based on the number protons found in the nucleus of the atom. However, you may have another option. Carbon has 6 protons, always. Give it an extra neutron? Still carbon. Give it an extra electron? Still carbon. Give it an extra proton? Now it's nitrogen. No getting around around it, any atom with 6 protons is defined as carbon, so you can't just replace spot number six with a different element. However, that doesn't mean that all carbon acts the same. Diamonds are made of carbon. Graphite is made of carbon. Why are they so different? Because of the atomic structures that carbon can stably form. Allotropy is the ability for some chemical elements(like carbon) to take multiple forms, and this can result in vastly different properties from the same base element. So, while you can't scientifically replace an existing element with a new element, you certainly can semi-scientifically say that some element has weird properties when structured a certain way, and that simply nobody had tested that form yet in our world. 

The above could be a dictionary or a grocery list, there is no difference to you. The Zoblings are going to have the same problem we had when trying to understand the Egyptian hieroglyphics. We were only able to understand these hieroglyphs when we found the Rosetta Stone, since we then had a reference for what the symbols mean, not just what set of symbols they had. It's not even enough to hear the humans speak, since the Zoblings will have no way to understand how any letter is pronounced and thus can't match spoken words to the written words. Unless the Zoblings can get a human to give examples to words in the dictionary or find some translation of a few words into the Zobling's language, they won't be able to decipher the meaning of what the weird symbols in the dictionary are. However, if the end goal is just proving that the Zoblings are intelligent, then they have better options: mimicking humans sounds/actions to show they understand human are doing something, coordinating themselves to perform some patterns like tapping their feet a certain number of times over and over again until the humans pay attention, etc. 

I'm suggesting the Kugelblitz. What fancier way to power your craft than a black hole made out of light? Using high-power lasers you could create a black hole, and use the hawking radiation as a source of power. Basically a battery. For ideal output its life should be made to be about 8 years.(For space exploration at least) But it could be tuned to anything you like, even 10 000 years. Perhaps create multiple ones to get long-term power. Another alternative is to just feed the black hole with arbitrary matter. It works on sand, water, air or whatever you happen to have. So after its created its basically a matter - energy converter. The output of a 4.5 year lasting, 600 000 tonne black hole would be 160 Petawatts. I think you could get by with much less, though that would increase the mass significantly. The problem is the immense amount of energy needed. The common options include using nano robots to convert mercury(the planet) into a dyson sphere of small solar panels. Creating the 8year blackhole would take about a week(If I remember correctly) of the suns output. But the evaporation time(thus the output power) reduces exponentially with weight/energy input. So it might be possible. Good video about Kugelblitz(Also includes other stuff) 

Make sex the reward of the truest believers and make them produce the offspring. Lets say the special 5% can participate. You could even selectively breed the best humans for your tastes, the stupidest ones to make them easy to control. Or maybe the most beautiful ones(beauty ~= biological perfection) And the rest would live in chaste. 

The remains would mummify, petrify, erode, and eventually become just another mineral layer. Where water is available the organic remains will dissolve and be replaced with inorganic minerals to form fossils, and if no water is available the remains will desiccate and be preserved as mummies. 

If paper and pens still exist in this world, then physical invoices can be used as transaction records during the blackout. An invoice is a document that records all info related to a transaction, such as the agreed price, the items sold, and when the payment needs to be made. Today, both electronic and physical invoices are used for transaction where payments are not immediate(source: I develop transaction software), such as large-scale purchases of bulk goods. They are typically issued by the seller to the buyer, so many businesses would already be familiar with generating invoices. So, all that is needed to temporarily replace the electronic economy is a steady supply of paper and pens. The seller would write the goods being sold, the amounts, the prices, etc., and the buyer and seller would both sign/somehow mark the invoice in order to authenticate it. Two copies, one for the buyer and one for the seller, would likely be made. When the electronic systems come back online, these invoices would be used to ensure that the proper money transfers are made. 

It seems like you're trying to bend the rules on causality, or rather you're trying to blend two points that have no common cause into one. Paraphrasing the definition of causality: an effect cannot occur from a cause not in it's past light cone, and cannot cause an effect outside it's future light cone. A light cone is essentially the cone of all possible paths that a photon can take through spacetime. In other words, a light cone represents all possible effects that a cause can have, because the effect cannot reach outside of the cone without traveling faster than the photon/faster than light. I don't have enough physics doctorates to go into the math on why what you want is physically possible or impossible. However, I can roughly describe what would need to be possible for what you want to happen: Imagine you are looking at the light cone of an event coming toward you, i.e. you are looking at the base of the cone which looks like a circle. If the event that made that cone could have produced a different effect, i.e. created a different universe, and was also coming at you, then the two cones would look like a Venn diagram. The common parts of each universe are in the overlapping center of the two cones and are already 'blended' because they came from the same event. The edges, however, are the differences between the two universes and are what you want to blend together in your weird non-causality world. Therefore, the sci-fi alien hand-waving-the-non-fun physics explanation for blending two universes is simply blending two non-overlapping light cones into one, thus bending the rules of causality. Essentially, things just need to happen without any event causing them to happen.
