Okay, I agree that this answer comes actually a little late... If you type some values of your function into FindStat, you will see David Speyer's answer automatically generated, since it is obtained as a natural statistic obtained after applying a natural combinatorial map. To have some values, for size up to $4$ it is given by $$ [1] => 2, [2] => 3, [1,1] => 3, [3] => 4, [2,1] => 6, [1,1,1] => 4, $$ $$ [4] => 5, [3,1] => 8, [2,2] => 6, [2,1,1] => 8, [1,1,1,1] => 5. $$ 

Let $E_n(z)$ be the Eulerian polynomial $$E_n(z) = \sum_{\tau \in \mathfrak{S}_n} z^{\operatorname{des}(\tau)}$$ where $\mathfrak{S}_n$ denotes the set of all permutations of $\{1,\ldots,n\}$ and $\operatorname{des}(\tau)$ is the number of descents $\tau(i) > \tau(i+1)$ in the permutation $\tau$. These are studied in great detail, see its OEIS wiki page for other definitions and several properties. In particular, it is known the Eulerian polynomial has only negative and simple roots, $$E_n(z) = \prod_{i=1}^n (z+q^{(n)}_i)$$ for different positive numbers $q^{(n)}_i$. My question now is 

These are several comments rather than an answer: As you write, let $(Q,w,S)$ denote all subwords of $Q$ whose greedy product is $w$ with positions $S$ skipped. I moreover write $(Q,w)$ for w in the Artin group to be all subwords of $Q$ that are words for $w$. 

If I am not mistaken, the space $Alt$ has a basis given by $\{ \Delta_M(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}) \mid M \subset \mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N} \text{ finite}\}$. Here, $\Delta_M(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}) = \det[x_i^{p_j}y_i^{q_j}]_{1\leq i,j\leq n}$ for $M = \{ (p_1,q_1),\ldots,(p_n,q_n) \}$. You find this for example in Section 1.3 of Notes on Macdonald polynomials and the geometry of Hilbert schemes by Mark Haiman, see also the references therin. 

Assume that we have a pullback square $$ \begin{array}{ccc} A & \rightarrow & B \\ \downarrow & & \downarrow \\ C & \rightarrow & D \\ \end{array} $$ with all functors accessible, and all categories presentable (if needed, assume that $A \to C$ and $B \to D$ are left adjoints). Suppose further that we have three saturated (that is, closed under retracts, pushouts and transfinite compositions) classes of arrows $S(B),S(C),S(D)$ of, respectively, $B,C,D$. Assume that the functors $B \to D, C \to D$ preserve these classes. (It seems likely to me that the set $S(D)$ should not play any importance in what follows) Form the set $S(A)$ by requiring that it consists of all arrows of $A$ that are sent to $S(B)$ and $S(C)$ by the respective functors. Question: if $S(B),S(C),S(D)$ are generated by (small) sets, does it imply that $S(A)$ is generated by a set as well? EDIT: it may be not obvious that the formed class S(A) is weakly saturated. Assume it is. EDIT2: I do not know if the original question admits an affirmative answer. What is true is that, following a remark of Tim to this post, one can consider the situation with the right classes. Let me leave a statement that may be of use for someone who googles this post up. Lemma. Let $A$ be a presentable category together with a weak factorisation system $(L,R)$ having the property that 

I think the question “why we need” assumes something about “we”, and in some extent, about “need”. There are people who study those objects for their own sake, there are those who study applied PDE and have no need of model categories. Even those who enter the domain which can be covered by model categories often work in a specialised situation where more adapted techniques exist (homological algebra and triangulated categories for algebraic geometry being an example). I guess the meta-reason is that at the current historic moment (or maybe that will remain so indefinitely) any description of entities ‘’up to homotopy’’ from scratch cannot be done without having this ‘’up to homotopy’’ notion already defined. One has to break the vicious circle and pull things down from their ‘’platonic’’ world. Which brings me to the answer for Since categorical philosophy has proven itself to be reasonably natural, introducing categories with weak equivalences is both a natural step and something reflected in many examples. As we now know, this principle of modelling homotopy phenomena is, formally speaking, just as good as any other higher-categorical approach. Working with an arbitrary category with weak equivalences $(C,W)$ can be impossible in practice, but there are many ways to (homotopically) embed it into a model category. One can consider the category of simplicial presheaves on $C$ for instance, with a suitable Bousfield localisation of the projective model structure. (The examples usually present themselves with better, often canonical, embeddings.) One can thus work with the objects of $C$ by performing operations on the bigger model category and verifying that the answer is sensible for $C$. This adds to the explanation as why the notion is quite ubiquitous. Algebraic geometry (both the field and the community) has different tradition from algebraic topology, yet model categories have found their way here as well. For example, Kontsevich defines a noncommutative space as a suitable DG-category, and considers them up to Morita equivalence. There are a few model structures on DG-categories, which cover both the usual DG- and Morita equivalences, and they have been used to get various results, such as the theorem representing DG-functors between quasicoherent sheaf categories as bimodules. Another issue is the structure of noncommutative cohomological invariants, Hochschild cohomology, Deligne conjecture, and related matters. Many of the results (including laying a foundation of derived algebraic geometry) were obtained by people outside of the core algebraic topology community, with the use of model categories. 

Below my modified answer containing a complete bijection between the above sequences and Dyck paths: Let $a = (a_1,\ldots,a_n)$ be a sequence of $n$ integers. $a$ satisfies Property $A$ if it satisfies your two conditions above. This is 

@PietroMajer's comment essentially contained the answer already: Define a bijection $\phi$ between $k$-multisubsets of $\{ 1,\ldots,n \}$ to $k$-subsets of $\{ 1,\ldots,n+k-1\}$ by sending $\{ c_0 \leq c_1 \leq \ldots \leq c_{k-1} \}$ to $\{ c_0 < c_1+1 < c_2 + 2 < \ldots < c_{k-1}+k-1 \}$. This map sends lex order on the $k$-multisubsets to lex order on $k$-subsets. Thus, given your lex-position map $f$ on $k$-subsets provides the lex-position map $f \circ \phi$ on $k$-multisubsets. 

If I see it correctly, there is not much going on in the set $X(G)$ from the viewpoint of Coxeter systems: Let $S$ be the simple system and let $G$ be the Coxeter graph of $(W,S)$ with vertex set $S$. Then $$X(G) = \big\{ s_1 \cdots s_k \in W \mid \{s_1,\ldots,s_k\} \subseteq S\text{ with } s_is_j = s_js_i \text{ for all } 1 \leq i<j \leq k\big\}.$$ Since different choices of $s_1,\ldots,s_k$ yield different elements, $X(G)$ is in bijection with totally disconnected subsets of $G$. This is, $\mathcal{D}(G) = \{ A \subseteq G \mid A \text{ finite and totally disconnected}\}$ and $\mathcal{D}(G) \rightarrow X(G)$ given by $A = \{ s_1, \ldots s_k\} \subseteq G$ of size $k$ is sent to $s_1\cdots s_k \in X(G) \subseteq W$ is a bijection. In particular, $X(G)$ is finite for finite $S$ even if $W$ is infinite. Observe that I used that any two reduced words have the same simple generators involved. Thus, your desired property means that your element lives in a standard parabolic subgroup of type $\mathbb{A}_1^k$ for some $k$. This is exactly the describtion I gave. 

Let G be a finite subgroup of U(n), the unitary group acts on $\mathbb{C}^n$. If there is a unit vector $x$ in $\mathbb{C}^n$ such that g(x) is almost orthogonal to x, for all $g\in G$ except the identity, can we perturb x so that g(x) is exactly orthogonal to x, for all $g\in G$ except the identity? More precisely, can we find a very small number $\epsilon>0$, so that if there exist a unit vector $x$ and the inner product $|(g(x),x))|<\epsilon$ for all $g\in G$ \ {1}, then we can find another unit vector $y$, such that $(g(y),y)=0$ for all $g\in G$ \ {1}? Is it possible to further require that $||x-y||$ be small too? 

This is actually something in a paper but the author claimed it without proof. Let x be a positive elment of norm 1 in a $C^*-$algebra A, and Her(x) is the hereditary subalegbra generated by x. Given $\epsilon>0$,let $f_\epsilon$ be thecontinuous function on R defined as follow: $f_\epsilon \equiv 0 \quad on \quad [-\infty,\epsilon/2]$ $f_\epsilon \quad is \quad linear \quad on\quad [\epsilon/2,\epsilon]$ $f_\epsilon \equiv 1 \quad on\quad [\epsilon, +\infty]$ So $f_\epsilon$ increase to the identiy function on [0,1] when $\epsilon$ decrease to 0, and $Her(x)=\overline{\cup_{\epsilon>0} f_\epsilon(x)Af_\epsilon(x)}$. Let p be a projection in Her(x). then how do we know that there must exist a $\epsilon$ such that $p\in \overline{f_\epsilon(x)Af_\epsilon(x)}$? Or more generally, Let A be the inductive limit of {$A_n$}, and p is a projection in A,does it follow that p is actually in some $A_n$? 

Let me address something which is not explicitly mentioned in other answers. Job issues exist, and they exist not only for category-theorists or the like, even much more ''working'' (in the sense of MacLane) pure mathematicians are struggling. In my opinion, the reasons (and possibly the solutions) for this are socio-political in character, we can discuss that elsewhere. To return to math, I have not seen all the comments, but. First, using HTT to prove something, understanding the proofs of HTT, and doing HTT-level of papers are three different levels of difficulty. It is very instructive to have a problem from another field for which you would need higher categories, then it becomes much easier to navigate in the literature to find what you need, or ask precise questions to the experts. Later steps seem to follow as you get sucked in. On the go, you will perhaps start to value the aesthetics of the state-of-the-art in higher category theory, happy days. Even if your pure interest is category theory or something of that form, it helps. You learn more about (higher) category theory by applying it. And, we have to remember that it has been only 20 years since the active development of the field. Various papers which followed since the HTT book show that more thinking leads to more transparency. You mention that there is no Bourbaki for homotopy theory; certain people believe that it is yet to come, and working towards it represents a big prospect in mathematical foundations.
