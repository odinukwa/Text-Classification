A countably complete ideal $I$ on a set $Z$ ideal is c.c.c. when there is no uncountable family of pairwise disjoint $I$-positive subsets of $Z$. If such an ideal exists, then there exists a weakly Mahlo cardinal $\kappa$ and a $\kappa$-complete, c.c.c. ideal $J$ on $\kappa$. An example of such an ideal is the collection of measure zero subsets of a real-valued measurable cardinal. The existence of such an ideal, which is nowhere maximal ("ultra"), requires a large continuum. The standard proof of this is as follows. Build a tree of subsets of $\kappa$, with root $\kappa$. Suppose by induction that each level of the tree up to level $\alpha$ is a partition of $\kappa$. For every $J$-positive member of the partition, partition this into two disjoint $J$-positive sets. For members in $J$, don't split them. This gives you level $\alpha+1$ and a finer partition. At limit stages, take intersections. By the c.c.c., we must have all members of the partition in $J$ at level $\omega_1$, and no cofinal branches. There are $2^{<\omega_1} = 2^\omega$ many measure zero sets at that stage, so we have $\kappa$ equals a union of continuum many sets from $J$, so $2^\omega \geq \kappa$. My questions is: Does this process of building the tree terminate before $\omega_1$? If it does not, then by the c.c.c., some subtree of what we've constructed is a normal Suslin tree. So in some cases, we know the process does halt at a countable stage: (a) If we start with a measurable $\kappa$ and force MA$_\kappa$ with the Solovay-Tennenbaum forcing, we get no Suslin trees, and a c.c.c. ideal on $\kappa$. (b) By a result of Laver, we can start with a model of MA$_{\omega_2}$ and a measurable above, and then force a real-valued measurable cardinal by random real forcing, keeping SH. So the obvious question is, is there any way to get a c.c.c., $\kappa$-complete ideal $J$ on $\kappa$, where we can find a Suslin tree embedded in the algebra of $J$-positive sets? Can this be done by adding measurably many Cohen reals? 

Orthogonal arrays were mentioned in another answer, but you are not requiring that each $k$-tuple occurs exactly once in every set of $k$ columns, but rather that each $k$-tuple occurs at least once in every set of $k$ columns. What you are looking for is called a covering array. In the usual notation for covering and orthogonal arrays, $v$ is the size of the alphabet ($2$ in this case), $k$ corresponds to your $n$, and $t$ corresponds to your $k$. Some known upper bounds for the number of rows for small values of $t,k,v$ are listed in $URL$ - you are interested in the numbers for $(t,k,2)$. 

Counterexample: Consider a graph consisting of three paths $u a_1\cdots a_{k-1} v$, $u b_1\cdots b_{k-1} v$, and $u c_1\cdots c_{k-1} v$, and no other vertices or edges. Every cycle contains exactly two of those paths so any two cycles share $k+1$ vertices. 

The problem is equivalent to the set cover problem and thus NP-hard. The set formulation you gave is: 

A dominating set of $(K_n)^{\square \,d}$ is equivalent to a $n$-ary covering code of length $d$ and covering radius $1$: just take the positions of the rooks to be the codewords. Known optimal sizes of covering codes are listed for example in Gerzson Kéri's website, although I don't know how up-to-date that information is. The notation is such that $K_q(n,R)$ is the optimal size of a $q$-ary covering code of length $n$ and covering radius $R$. With the notation in this question, you are looking for $K_n(d,1)$. In particular, the answer for $(K_4)^{\square\,4}$ is $K_4(4,1)=24$, given in "Bounds for quaternary and quinary covering codes, listed for n <= 11, R <= 8 ". (Yes, the $K_x$ part of the notation happens to be the same in both cases, which might be confusingly non-confusing; on the other hand the meaning of $n$ is different here and there.) 

Historically, mathematics did not begin with set theory, and most working mathematicians today do not really care about foundations. Furthermore, it is known that not much axiomatic strength is actually needed for undergraduate math: 

I'm not sure if this specific claim is stated explicitly anywhere, but it follows from the more general discussion about intermediate extensions in Jech, page 247. If we take any $x \in L[r]$, then there is a complete subalgebra $A$ of the random algebra associated to $\dot{x}$, with the property that $L[x]=L[G_r \cap A]$. But any complete subalgebra of a measure algebra is also a measure algebra. So $A$ is isomorphic to random forcing. 

It's consistent that the answer is no. Bartoszynski and Judah prove the following on page 26 in their book, Set Theory: On the Structure of the Real Line: 

Here's an example using random and Cohen forcing, denoted respectively by $\mathcal R$ and $\mathcal C$. Consider the two-step iteration $\mathcal C * \dot{\mathcal R}$. If $(c,r)$ are generic reals for this iteration, then $r$ is random over the ground model $V$. Therefore the random forcing as constructed in $V$ completely embeds into $\mathcal C * \dot{\mathcal R}$. The map takes the following form. If $x$ is a code for a positive measure Borel set, and $A_x$ denotes the set coded, then we map $e : A_x \mapsto (1,\dot{A_{\check x}})$. An important point is that while the generic Cohen real changes the interpretation of $A_x$, $c$ does not exclude any such $\dot{A_{\check x}}^c$ from being in $\dot{\mathcal R}^c$, since the statement that $x$ codes a set of positive measure is absolute. So to show this is a counterexample, we just need to show that the ground-model measure algebra $\mathcal R_0$ (given in terms of Borel codes), is not a regular subalgebra of the random forcing in $V[c]$. Suppose it were, then: (1) The real $s$ given by $e^{-1}$ applied to the generic filter determined by $(c,r)$ would be random over $V[c]$. This is because a regular embedding of a partial order $\mathbb P$ into a complete boolean algebra $B$ extends uniquely to a complete embedding of $\mathcal B(\mathbb P)$ into $B$, and any complete subalgebra of a measure algebra is a measure algebra. (2) Forcing with $\mathcal R$ over $V[c]$ is equivalent to forcing with $\mathcal R_0 * \dot{\mathbb Q}$, where $\mathbb Q$ is some further (possibly trivial) forcing. Thus $(c,s)$ is (Cohen $\times$ Random)-generic over $V$, and so $c$ is Cohen-generic over $V[s]$. By a well-known argument, $c$ constructs a Borel code $y$ for a measure zero set that covers all ground model reals. Thus in $V[s][c]$, $s \in A_y$, and therefore there is a code $\neg y \in V[c]$ for a measure one set such that $s \notin A_{\neg y}$, meaning $s$ is not random over $V[c]$. I also have an example involing Suslin trees and collapsing $\omega_1$, but it seems more interesting if we can stick to random and Cohen. EDIT: Here's the other example. The idea is very similar to my MM example. First note that it suffices to show the situation can be forced by some $\mathbb P$, because then if $\dot A, \dot B, \dot C$ are the algebras in $V^{\mathbb P}$, we can use $\mathbb P * \dot A, \mathbb P * \dot B, \mathbb P * \dot C$ in the ground model. So assume there is a Suslin tree $T$ (which can always be forced), and let $G \subseteq Col(\omega,\omega_1)$ be generic. Since $\omega_1^V$ and $T$ are now countable, we can add a countable top level $l$ to $T$ such that every node in $T$ is below something in $l$. Further, since $Col(\omega,\omega_1) \cong Col(\omega,\omega_1) \times Add(\omega,1)$, and a Cohen real adds a Suslin tree, there is a Suslin tree $S$ in $V[G]$. Now above each node at level $l$, put a copy of $S$, and call this $T'$, which is also a Suslin tree. The set of predecessors of any node at level $l$ determines a $V$-generic branch through $T$. Therefore, by general forcing lemmas, the map $e : T \to Col(\omega,\omega_1) * \dot S$ given by $p \mapsto || p \in \dot H ||$ is a complete embedding, and in this case we can see that $e(p) = (1,p)$ for all $p \in T$. So $\mathcal B(T)$ appears as a complete subalgebra of $\mathcal B(Col(\omega,\omega_1) * \dot S)$. If $G$ is the collapse generic as before, then $T / G = T$. But $T$ is not a regular suborder of $S$ in $V[G]$ since $T$ is countable and thus adds a real over $V[G]$, while $S$ doesn't add reals. 

Asymptotically $$ p(n) \sim \frac{1}{4 n \sqrt{3}} \exp\left(\pi \sqrt{\frac{2n}{3}}\right), $$ which gives (Well, technically this is valid only for even $n$, but odd $n$ wouldn't be much different.) $$ \frac{p(n/2)^2}{p(n)} \sim \frac{1}{n\sqrt{3} } \exp\left( (2-\sqrt{2}) \pi \sqrt{\frac{n}{3}} \right). $$ Because $p_2(n)>p(n/2)^2$, we know that $p_2(n)/p(n)$ grows faster than any polynomial, as Amritanshu Prasad suggested in a comment. 

In a similar fashion, we can take the complement (of only edges between $X$ and $Y$) in the graph formulation, and then $k+1$ is the minimum number of vertices in $X$ needed to cover $Y$. But after a quick search I couldn't find this kind of covering number used in literature. 

For $k=7,\dots,11$, you can fulfil the two first conditions using a set of $6$ mutually orthogonal Latin rectangles (MOLR) of size $6\times k$ (actually $5$ would be enough, see note at the bottom). They exist when $k\geq 7$ is a prime power and apparently also when $k=10$ (see Table 3.118 in Handbook of Combinatorial designs). An $m\times n$ Latin rectangle ($m \leq n$) is an $m\times n$ array of symbols from a set of size $n$ (say $0,1,\dots,n-1$) such that every row contains each symbol exactly once and every column contains each symbol at most once. Two Latin rectangles are mutually orthogonal if there is no pair of positions that have the same symbol in the first rectangle and have the same symbol in the second rectangle. Here, each position corresponds to a player and each rectangle corresponds to a round. The symbol tells the player's team in the round. There are $6$ of each symbol in every rectangle so the teams have $6$ players, and orthogonality means that no pair of players is on the same team twice. Note: The requirement that the rectangles are Latin is not necessary in this case (as rows and columns don't mean anything), only the condition that each symbol occurs $6$ times in each rectangle is used. This can be used to add another round using a rectangle that has $0$ in the first column, $1$ in the second column etc., so in general you need only $n-1$ MOLR for $n$ rounds. 

Bartoszyński-Judah's definition is NOT what you say, it is in fact the same as Shelah's notion. In Set Theory: On the Structure of the Real Line, they define "indestructibly c.c.c." on page 177: Then they prove (theorem 3.5.26) that if $\mathcal{P}$ has the Knaster property, then it is indestructibly ccc, per this definition. (One can also show that having the Knaster property is itself indestructible by ccc forcing.) I have not seen elsewhere the claim that the Knaster property implies that the ccc is indestructible by any forcing. Do you have a proof of this? Tangentially, while I was looking in Bartoszyński and Judah's book, I found a notable mistake. They claim (lemma 1.5.14) that $\mathcal{P} * \dot{\mathcal{Q}}$ has precaliber $\aleph_1$ iff $\mathcal{P}$ has precaliber $\aleph_1$ and $\Vdash_{\mathcal{P}} \dot{\mathcal{Q}}$ has precaliber $\aleph_1$. This is false. As noted in the comments on the original post, MA$_{\aleph_1}$ implies the ccc is equivalent to having precaliber $\aleph_1$. So assume MA$_{\aleph_1}$, and let $\mathcal{C}$ be Cohen forcing, and $\dot{\mathcal{T}}$ be a $\mathcal{C}$-name for a Suslin tree (by Shelah). So in $V$, the iteration $\mathcal{C} * \dot{\mathcal{T}}$ has precaliber $\aleph_1$, but $\Vdash_{\mathcal{P}} \dot{\mathcal{T}}$ does not have precaliber $\aleph_1$. 

I think it is historically important to see that the earlier results involving generic ultrapowers, such as those of Solovay in the late 1960s, did not depend on the far-future realizations of Laver and Woodin. The Laver/Woodin result is important and interesting, but it seems that the known applications of generic ultrapowers can be formally justified by localization rather than appeal to the definability of the ground model. It seems that applications of generic embeddings can always be obtained by considering some initial segment of the universe. For example, let's consider the result of Jech-Prikry that if there is an $\omega_2$-saturated ideal on $\omega_1$, then there are no Kurepa trees. Let $\theta$ be a sufficiently large regular cardinal, say much bigger than say $2^{2^{\omega_1}}$. Then $G$ is generic over $V$ iff $G$ is generic over $H_\theta$. Also, $\theta$ can be taken large enough that the ultrapower $H_\theta^{\omega_1}/G$ is well-founded iff the ultrapower of $V$ is. The argument that there are no Kurepa trees goes by considering $j(T)$ where $T$ is some $\omega_1$-tree. If it is Kurepa, then $j(T)$ has $\omega_2^V$ nodes at level $\omega_1^V$. This is impossible if $\omega_2^V$ is a cardinal in $V[G]$, since $j(\omega_1^V) = \omega_2^V$, and the levels of $j(T)$ have size less than $j(\omega_1) = \omega_2^V$. It is not hard to convince yourself that this argument can be carried out by considering generic ultrapowers of $H_\theta$, which can obviously be referred to in $V[G]$. The general lesson is that almost always, such metamathematical issues can be resolved in a similar way. Verifying a local property usually depends only on another local property. Purported counterexamples should be carefully examined.
