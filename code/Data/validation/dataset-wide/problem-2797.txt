The fundamental disagreement between coherentism (to which Bonjour is but one — quite influential — contributor) and foundationalism is, at its root, the justification for knowledge. Bonjour's disagreement, much the same as most coherentists, lies in the foundationalist belief (in the general sense, as there are different types of foundationalism) that all inferential knowledge must ultimately derive from some non-inferential belief/justification (which one is a point of debate). Here, "inferential knowledge" means knowledge derived from something else. Roughly: 

What this means is that you can have an unthought-of justification for an unthought-of belief in an unthought-of truth. I think the statement "knowing something does not imply knowing that you know something" must be using two different definitions of knowledge (or a different one entirely), because using the above argument one can observe the following: Suppose I know that twice two makes four. Even if I haven't really thought about it, I still know it by the above definition of knowledge. Now, let's see whether I know that I know something: 

A major concern in epistemology is just what we can know about existential claims, that is, claims about the existence (or lack of) something. Suppose for example that I assert the following: 

I would suggest that one way to distinguish cause from effect when the two are simultaneous is through material implication. That is, if at some time two events A and B occur, the cause is that one which implies the other. So, if A being true means B must be true, then A is in some sense the cause of B (I realize that the whole correlation versus causation problem comes up here, but I am only trying to provide a rough model). For example, suppose that at some time t we have a big spherical mass M (event A), and from a distance r away you (mass m) experience a real force equal to GMm/r^2 (event B). In this case, A implies B by Newtonian gravity. However, B does not imply A: there could instead be a number of different masses that happen to produce that force. For your example specifically, I think it is important to flesh out the definitions. We say that real force causes acceleration inversely proportional to mass. Fictitious force, on the other hand, is caused by acceleration on a frame (which is caused by a real force or another fictitious force). So, if for that example we have a real force on an object and an acceleration in that object simultaneously, the real force implies an acceleration, but the acceleration does not imply a real force: it implies either a real force or a fictitious force. If instead we have a fictitious force on an object and an acceleration on that object's frame simultaneously, the fictitious force does not imply an acceleration on that specific frame (it could be any frame that happens to contain the object), while the acceleration on the frame does imply a fictitious force on the object. This may seem a bit picky, but pickyness can make all the difference when you're talking about simultaneous events. I think this is the crucial difference between cause and effect: not temporal separation, but material implication. After all, that's why it's called "cause" and "effect", not "before" and "after". 

There is in fact definite textual support for the Republic being a meritocracy, and indeed through the noble lie of metals. However, I do not think this gives it even a tinge of democracy, as Socrates makes it clear that all the power ultimately lies in the guardians, a small and exclusive group of virtuous people. When he is describing the noble lie of the metals (wherein it is preached that all people have come from the earth, and they are either of the type gold, silver or bronze), Socrates comments that: 

Scenario 2 is famously presented by Chalmers as the "Fading Qualia" thought experiment - he uses it to argue that surely, consciousness is preserved, because it's implausible that such minor stepwise modifications which preserve functionality could actually be changing anything about our experience. Against him, he notes, Searle argues (The Rediscovery of the Mind, pp. 66-67) that in fact one's conscious experience would slowly fade (a gradual mental death, in effect) while one's behaviour remains continuous and unchanged. In today's terminology, one is slowly transformed to a philosophical zombie. Within this debate, scenario 1 is a bigger puzzle. It relates to the teleportation paradox and challenges functionalists and non-functionalists alike. Roughly, it's often thought that to the subject the experience is continuous - sort of like waking from a coma with no sense of time having passed. From another angle, it gives reason to doubt true continuity of experience in somewhat Dennett-like fashion. On the whole you've here reproduced rather seminal problems in philosophy of mind. There's a wealth of literature on both! 

Eliran's answer is great, but it isn't the only answer. Russell indeed took the view that descriptions that refer to nothing render any surrounding statement false. Another major school of thought, though, and the one more often taught in contemporary philosophy of language and linguistics, is rooted in Frege's dissenting view: that such descriptors render statements meaningless. Thus, "the king of France is bald" is neither true nor false, but simply fails to have a meaning. No truth value, just a big question mark. The intuition used to promote this view is that there's something different about "there is a king of France" and "the King of France is bald". The former prompts a "no", while the latter tends to evoke a "...what?" Because it features a failed presupposition: that there even is a king of France. 

I think that the only difference between the two is the semantic objective of the definition. Naturalism (see the SEP) is the view that the world can be explained entirely by physical, natural phenomena/laws. Naturalists either assert that there is no supernatural (or metaphysical) existence, or that if there is, it has no impact on our physical world. The branch called Ontological Naturalism focuses on how science can explain the world fully with physical laws. Methodological Naturalism focuses on the idea that philosophy and science share pursuits, and holds that any mention of the supernatural has no place in either philosophy or science. Materialism is the related view that all existence is matter, that only matter is real, and so that the world is just physical. It simply describes a view on the nature of the universe, while the different branches of Naturalism focus on applications of effectively the same view. Thus, the difference between the two is the purpose of the definition - materialism makes an argument about the ontology of the universe, while naturalism takes a premise (effectively that of materialism) to make an argument on how science/philosophy should function.
