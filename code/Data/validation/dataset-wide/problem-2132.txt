It depends. It's entirely possible that no one will notice or that they'll assume that you're just not much of a vacation person. Most people don't keep track of who has and who has not used their allotted vacation. It is possible that they'll conclude that you're a doormat that doesn't value their own time. If you're cancelling because your manager would otherwise have no choice but to cancel someone's vacation, it's possible that your boss and/or your fellow employees will be grateful. The odds of that happening once a year let alone more than twice, however, are tiny unless you work in either a very unusual or a very poorly managed workplace. 

If your company wants to have an exit interview, it is unlikely that you can avoid it (at least not without damaging your relationship with the company). Go to the interview. Feel free to politely answer questions without being brutally honest. "I don't have any suggestions to give you", for example, can just as easily mean that you're politely declining to share suggestions that you don't expect to be implemented. 

In general, employment in the United States is "at will". That means that barring a situation where an employer is violating some anti-discrimination law, either the employer or the employee can terminate employment at any time for any reason. Unless the employer is doing something like allowing employees of one race/ gender/ religion to have photographs and barring others from doing so or the employer is creating rules just for you as a pretext to discriminate, it's well within the employer's rights to create stupid policies and to enforce them (even imperfectly). Of course, most employers recognize that just because they can create stupid policies, that is no reason to go out and do so. Allowing employees to do a bit of personalization of their environment generally makes them happier and more productive and doesn't generally cost the employer anything. It may be worth asking your manager to explain why the policy exists and seeing if the policy can be changed. Perhaps there were problems in the past where employees were going crazy decorating their offices/ cubicles to the point that it was creating a fire hazard or infringing on their ability to get work done with decorations on every surface. If that's the case, the company should be willing to change the policy to allow a couple of family photos and other incidentals. 

My first wager would be that the company simply adds that boilerplate language to all offers and then figures out based on the role whether a physical exam is actually required. The letter doesn't say that there will be an exam, just that you'll need to complete one if requested. It may be easier to include that text on every letter rather than maintaining two different offer letter templates, one for positions that have physical requirements and one for positions that don't and making sure that everyone gets the right letter. My next guess is that the "physical exam" is really just a drug screen. Depending on the nature of what software you're developing, the company may need/ want to verify that you're not using illegal drugs. But since that generally just involves a urine test, it would be a bit odd to refer to that as a physical exam. Finally, it's possible that the company is simply being proactive about employee health and disabilities. If they're hiring for an IT position where you'll be crawling around laying cables or moving PCs all day, they may want the doctor to determine whether you can physically do the work and/or what accommodations the employee would require. If you'll be doing purely software development, they may want a doctor to look for signs of carpel-tunnel and other repetitive stress injuries and to recommend ergonomic adjustments to your workstation. 

Yes, there certainly are cases where companies pay 20-30% more per hour (and often much more than that) for consultants rather than employees. Of course, if you go through a consulting company, the consulting company will take a chunk of that because they handle things like marketing, generating leads, billing, etc. and may offer some benefits. If you want to maximize your per hour pay, you'll want to do all of that yourself-- of course, that means that you'll need to spend lots of time doing things other than being a software developer. If you are in the United States, make sure that if you go the contracting route, that you'll be responsible for your own health insurance and self-employment taxes (the employer portion of Social Security taxes) that will easily eat through 30% of your income (hence you probably want more than that). And that's before you add in things like insurance, lawyers, accountants, retirement plans, holidays, vacations, time between contracts etc. Plus, you'll be doing lots of non-software development work on the side so you'll have to be good at sales and marketing, negotiating contracts, managing client relationships, and everything else that comes with running a business in addition to being a good developer. And, of course, that assumes that the company is happy with either an employee or a contractor. For most roles, companies prefer one or the other. Generally, companies want to have employees for long-term open-ended projects and wouldn't want to have a contractor for that sort of role. On the other hand, if companies are looking for particular expertise for a particular project over a particular period, they'd rather have a contractor rather than an employee that they potentially have to fire or find a new role for when the project ends. 

What do you need in order to be able to solve the issues? Come back with a proposal. Perhaps you need additional training in some technology or methodology to be able to do the root cause analysis. Perhaps you need a consultant (from a vendor or a third party) to come in for a period to help you diagnose the issue. Perhaps you need management to help you escalate your support requests. Perhaps you need upgraded software. Perhaps you need more time to focus on the issue and you need someone else to take on certain tasks for a while. None of these, presumably, come with a guarantee of success. But a plan for how you're going to move forward not only makes you seem proactive it lets other people assist you. When you go to an expert (a doctor, a lawyer, a plumber, whatever), it's perfectly reasonable for that expert to determine that they need to get additional assistance. Your doctor might need to call in a specialist to help with a tricky diagnosis. Your lawyer might need to consult with an accountant to help her prepare some documents. In this case, you're the expert so you get to determine what additional assistance you need. Your managers likely don't care about (or, frankly, understand) the steps you followed to troubleshoot the issue, they just want to know what you need to solve the problem permanently. If you have proposed solutions or at least things that would diagnose the problem and those solutions are rejected as too costly then you know that the business sees the cost of the problem as less than your proposed solutions and that you can calmly point this out when the problem flares up again. It's perfectly reasonable to say "I know you want the root cause of the problem to be identified. I've proposed replacing the foo and upgrading the software on the bar. Either of those would likely solve the problem/ pinpoint the root cause/ etc. That proposal was rejected as too costly. If you would like to revisit that, I would be happy to get some up to date pricing from the vendor. Otherwise, I can continue to work on mitigating the issue but we probably won't be able to identify a root cause unless we get very lucky." 

Assuming that the company doesn't mind keeping you around (and paying you) for another day, the notice period is simply a minimum. Generally, no one will object if you specify that your last day will be later than the minimum required date so just specify what day you'd like to be your last. Of course, it is possible that the company may ask you to leave earlier. However, if your boss and HR are already aware that you're leaving, it is exceptionally unlikely that there will be any objections to you staying an extra day. 

Treat it like any other misdirected email. Reply to whoever got you involved, let them know that you're not the Mordred that they intended to email. Don't mention any of the content. And do it sooner rather than later-- if you've watched the thread for days, it's going to look like you're snooping when you fess up. Realistically, unless you're an expert in taxation, it is likely to be very difficult to judge from an email thread whether a group of people are acting ethically to minimize taxes by avoiding certain actions that trigger taxable events or whether those people are discussing unethical or illegal ways to structure the transaction to avoid taxes. There are already attorneys and outside people in the conversation that have an obligation to bring up that sort of thing. I'd always err on the side of giving other people the benefit of the doubt that they're planning to behave responsibly. If you are convinced that the company is behaving poorly and that the city has made a mistake in assessing the tax, you could send an anonymous note to the city alerting them that there may be an issue. Generally, though, the tax bureaucracy isn't going to jump to action to investigate that sort of charge. Plus, there is a decent chance that it's not an issue or not something the city can correct until the next assessment (which may not happen for a while if the deal is structured correctly). 

I suspect that by the time you've done this a couple times, you won't be getting many interviews at companies that you'd like to work for. Realistically, unless you want things out of a job that very few other developers do, the sort of companies that you'd want to work at are the sort of companies that a lot of other developers are applying to as well. That means that these companies have the ability to be very picky about who they hire. A recruiter may give you a free pass for one very short term job since everyone is entitled to an occasional mistake. But a string of 2 or 3 jobs that lasted only a couple months would be a huge red flag that would be almost impossible to overcome when there are likely to be many highly qualified people to choose from. At the sort of companies that you would, presumably, want to work for, the assumption is that a new hire is likely to be a drag on team productivity for the first few months. They're going to be investing a lot of time and effort teaching you about their systems, explaining their architecture to you, helping familiarize you with the code base, training you on technologies they use that you may not have worked with, etc. They invest all this time in the expectation that you're going to be around for at least a few years and that these initial investments will pay off in improved productivity for years to come. Plus, the companies that you'd want to work for are spending a ton of money recruiting candidates and ensuring that they're hiring people that are worth that sort of investment. A recruiter that sees someone with a bunch of short-term stays at permanent positions is going to expect that if they hire you, they'll invest a bunch of resources only to have you walk out the door in 3 months and have to restart the hiring process again. No company worth working for wants that. Potentially, you would want to look for short-term contract work. There are plenty of companies that want to bring someone in for a couple months to work on a particular project. There are, however, likely to be problems with this approach. Companies looking for a developer for a 2-3 month contract are generally going to treat the contract developer very differently than a permanent employee (and the type of companies looking for short-term contract help may not be the type of companies that would have an environment that you would find satisfactory). You'd be coming in to work on one particular project, often along with a bunch of other contract developers, so the company wouldn't be investing much time in helping you learn their environment. They're much more likely to dictate designs and architectures and treat the contract developers as interchangable parts rather than giving you the autonomy that they might give a permanent employee. And the social interactions you have as a short-term contract employee are likely to be different than what you'd expect as a permanent employee since everyone expects you to be gone shortly. If you have very particular requirements, you would really want to make sure that you understand what those requirements are and that you communicate them in the process of interviewing with a company. If you won't be happy without an office or without a high-end development machine or dual 32" monitors or scrum-based agile development process, ask the interviewer about those things and only take a job where you're going to be happy. It certainly shouldn't take a lot of trial-and-error to find a place you'd like to work.
