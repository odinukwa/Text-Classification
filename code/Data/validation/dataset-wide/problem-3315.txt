I found this site, called Omniglot. If you scroll down there are also links to other similar resources and multilingual pages. I don't know if there is a search tool, but in case you don't find the expression you need, you can explore the site for other resources or visit the links for external sites. 

The number of native speakers that are still alive (at the moment of the analysis); the average age of these native speakers (or fluent speakers); the percentage of the new generations that acquire fluency in that given language. 

Apart from the "present tense" rule you mentioned, I found this page where you can see a rather good explanation about AAVE and its rules. I'll paste the part regarding the copula (as usual the * indicates something ungrammatical): 

First of all, note that being a pro-drop language doesn't necessarily mean that a given language lacks pronouns. They just avoid using them because they are not required in all situations. Japanese is not a pro-drop because its personal pronouns have a particular etymology. It's pro-drop because when people speak Japanese, they omit these pronouns, since they can be understood from the context, or for a matter of "polite/casual speech". In other languages they are avoided because the morphology of that language already brings that information. Let's take as an example the verb parlare which means "to speak" in Italian. The first person would be "io parlo". But usually people say "parlo", as there is no need for us to use the personal pronouns. If I say "parlo", everyone will understand who I'm referring to without ambiguity at all. But it would be also wrong to say that Italian lacks personal pronouns, since they do exist but they're simply not always required, as they are in English. I'm not aware of any language that lacks pronouns completely. Probably it'd be easier to find languages that have less than others. But languages tend to "economize", so pronouns are one of the logical consequences. Regarding your second question, I think it'd deserve a question by itself. Anyway, even if languages lose a certain personal pronoun, it's not granted that they will just lose it, as they can simply replace it. Let me re-take Italian again: We have egli/ella (he/she) and lui/lei (him/her). The second ones have almost totally replaced the first ones. I'd never say "egli mi ha detto che..." which means he told me that..., but rather "lui mi ha detto che..." and theoretically this would be wrong, because it would be like saying *him told me that... but now it's the common form being used by native speakers. This would deserve itself research on its own, but as you can see even if "we're losing" a pronoun, instead of being without one, we replaced it. 

Norma dell'Area Seriore (Older Area, seriore means "chronologically later") The zones where the language has arrived later will keep an early form. 

Swedish has quite a peculiarity that I haven't found (yet) in other languages. There are some spellings that are pronounced all the same way. Currently the number of these spellings is disputed, but it seems that a minimum list was compiled. From this section in the Swedish Alphabet wikipedia article: 

1: I'm not really sure about the Group C, because I found two slightly contradicting sources, unless I misunderstood that part. If some Russian native speaker can give a contribution, it would be nice. 

I'm reading Possession in Yucatec Maya by Christian Lehmann (March 2003) and I came across this passage: 

I don't know about any material on this topic but I can tell you my experience that I think applies to most Italians, if not all. First, you need to know that a lot of Italian dialects are considered full-fledged languages, completely independent from Italian, with their own grammar and structures. So understanding is harder because the grammar is different, the vocabulary and the syntax too, not just the pronunciation. Sardinian is one such example, although considering the lack of written standard in its history, a lot of vocabulary (relatively speaking) has been — quite sadly — lost, and various Italian loanwords have entered the language, so an Italian speaker might locate them now and then. Among the factors that determine how much you can understand, there's the distance of course, because the closer a certain dialect/language/variety is to you, the easier it will be to understand. Even within the same region, this is still true: Varieties can change from town to town and even from village to village. However this doesn't work in a proportional manner, because other factors enter the equation. Another factor is familiarity. I have had a lot of contact with Sicilians, for example, so my understanding of it has been increased compared to someone that heard it less. If a friend of mine is speaking on the phone with their relatives/friends in Sicilian, I might understand words or at least, the general gist of the conversation. Of course, there is not one Sicilian. Like I said, they can change from place to place even within the same region. Especially since a lot of dialects lack a written standard. One more factor is whether you speak broad or not. When Italians say "parlare (dialetto) stretto", it means to speak a pure dialect. This usually means that you're not just speaking Italian with a strong local accent. It means that you're usually speaking "strictly" as the locals do: strong accent, (sometimes) almost unintelligible pronunciation with a fast pacing and with words completely mixing with each other, so that it's virtually impossible for someone else to understand what is being said, and of course - local vocabulary/syntax/grammar. If you have little or no familiarity and the speaker is not using any "keyword" (similar words across languages), then you won't likely understand anything. Even with familiarity (but still being from another region), you will probably miss a lot of it. 

What is being done there is a pro-form substitution (replacement); "this/that" are called pro-forms. I think that in this case "a pronoun substitutes a noun or a noun phrase, with or without a determiner" such as it or this. 

1: To be honest, you don't even need to call them "honorific prefixes/suffixes", since saying "honorifics" is also a noun and not just an adjective. 

I couldn't read the first and not the second much either. So, why the third one is simpler? There was a study done by the Cambridge University, that stated that the order of the letters was not important, except for the first and the last one. If you mix them all, like in the first two, you'll need time to anagram them and proceed, but with the last one you can read it faster (and more easily). The neologism created to denote this cognitive process is Typoglycemia, a portmanteau of typo + glycemia. The origin of this seems to come from a letter sent to the New Scientist (I can't find a version that can be read without subscribing), by Dr. Graham Rawlinson, although it also seems that a researcher think it was wrongly-attributed (read here). I think you can also check his "The significance of letter position in word recognition" in 1976. Not all languages seem to work like this. Arabic for example, because in the written form it has no vowels (you add them reading, if I remember well); Finnish and Turkish words are too long, and for languages like Thai that has no space between words, it doesn't work. Lastly, here is a site where you can type or paste text and mix it (the button does it). 

Hooiaioia in Hawaiian (meaning certified), with 8 vowels, seems to have the most consecutive vowels in current human speech. It is also listed in 1976 Guinness Book of World Records. 

I've searched this symbol and I've discovered that it's a Determinative and the concepts it refers to are "eat, drink, speak, tell, feel, think, love". The word 1 (transcription: sDd) that contains it, means "to converse". I think you could start from here and see what comes up. 

Classifiers are not really present in European languages (English included), but you can have constructions that support such a feature, for example with uncountable nouns: five heads of cattle. Japanese however, among others, use classifiers (typically called counters) in more cases. Each classifier is used according to the referent (classifier is bold): 

Deixis concerns the use of certain linguistic expressions to locate entities in spatiotemporal, social and discursive context. First and second person pronouns, demonstratives, tense, certain place and time adverbials, verbs such as come, go, bring, take and fetch. Such deictic expressions encode specific aspects of the speech event and cannot be interpreted unless contextual parameters are taken into account. Without physical context we cannot interpret utterances like: 

I was wondering, what is the method (or the methods) that linguists adopt to understand and know the etymology of a word? Are these methods reliable and in what measure? The knowledge I have on the matter is not that deep so I wanted to know exactly what happens "behind" that Origin entry in my dictionary. 

The text is cohesive but I don't think it's also coherent. Cohesion is achieved through some devices, such as the pronouns (you used he in your example)1, so there is cohesion. Both sentences are about Ali. But the text has no coherence, there is no (necessary) logic correlation between loving fish and living in the North. 

When a language is being transcribed to IPA, is the whispering included in the transcription? If so, how? I saw the Wikipedia mention about not being anything for whispering, but I was wondering if this has ever been analysed in some paper or article. 

In British English, actually, the diphthongization is [əʊ], while [oʊ] is more US pronunciation. English doesn't have a single [o] in words, because it's a short vowel and English doesn't have a short "o" sound. The case where it's not followed by [ʊ] is [ɔ:], as in caught. If you look at this page about English Phonology, and you look at the table reporting the vowels in English, you'll see that the box for "mid back short" is empty. 

Below I organized them for ease of reference (it's an image, I'm not sure you wanted just a list for reference or a txt file): 

Up to this point I still had some doubts but another paper, concerning facial expressions recognition, "Facial feature tracking and expression recognition for sign language" by İsmail Arı, about the previous work said that3: 

The usual limit is considered to be between the 3rd and the 4th year of age (I've also seen only the 3rd year being mentioned, but well, we're still around that time). There is a mention about this on the wikipedia page for Sequential bilingualism, but there is a document that treats it more in depth: "Incomplete acquisition in bilingualism: re-examining the age factor" by Silvina Montrul. 

You can also check the Grammar section in this page, or these documents: "Copula Variation in African American Vernacular English" and "African American vernacular English: features, evolution, educational implications". 

Note that the asterisk has an already established use within linguistics and it would be very confusing of you to adopt it for other purposes. 

I think you're mixing two different categories, Tag questions and fillers. You know and I mean are fillers, while I'd consider right? and isn't it? to be tag questions. The purpose is quite different, and consider: 

I'll consider Russian because it's the one I know better. The Russian language has the animate/inanimate distinction, but it's rather a noun category than another gender. Russian has only 3 genders: Masculine, feminine and neuter. Such distinction affects the nouns' inflection when they are in the accusative case. The nouns, in this situation, follow this scheme. I'll only treat about the accusative singular (Otherwise the answer gets too long): 

In this context, the term accent might be a bit ambiguous. And in fact, you did make a distinction between what you meant and foreign accents. It is a synonym of stress, so it's not that strange that you thought of it, but as I said it's ambiguous and furthermore, it has no opposites that I'm aware of. Going through your proposals for the sake of completeness: 

As you may already know, Latin was the official language of the empire. Actually, it gained importance and prestige for that very reason, thanks to the Roman Empire that brought it everywhere in the Mediterranean Sea. It was especially used in the western part of the Empire as a lingua franca. In the eastern part, it was used in the Balkan peninsula (Dacia, Mesia and the northern Macedonia) and in Asia (Berytus – the modern Beirut, Heliopolis and Pisidia). But in the eastern Mediterranean sea, Latin couldn't overweight the koiné dialektos (κοινὴ διάλεκτος) — which was the language used in those zones — not even in Constantinople. In this city, Latin was used until the year 450, then replaced by Greek that became the official language of the Eastern Roman Empire, or Byzantine Empire, in the third decade of the VIIth Century (year 620), until the year 1453. 

I'm not a researcher, but what I remember from my studies is that what makes words change pronunciation and meaning is basically people and the use they make of these words. Then you indirectly have culture, places, etc where these people find themselves which will influence as well. Even if we understand how these words do change, it's hard to create a word that doesn't respond to these factors or that ignores them because they are not predictable. Changes in meaning are really dependent on use and popularity and indeed, popular words will acquire new meanings or they will be adopted by other countries (many did with English words for example) in order to refer to a certain meaning. With changes in culture, in technology, science, and society, words will inevitably change. Changes in sounds are more regular and have less exceptions (real world ones still do), and this regularity is used by linguists, such as in the Comparative Method which "aims to prove that two or more historically attested languages are descended from a single proto-language by comparing lists of cognate terms." However one of the principles of Sound Change is that Sound change is unstoppable: All languages vary from place to place and time to time, and neither writing nor media prevent this change. In conclusion, your objective might not be reachable. 

What is meant by zero intension? And how does it apply to possession? I have read the definition of intension but I am not sure I still understand the concept completely. 

In Linguistics, I've always seen the term stressed be used in this context. Its opposite would be unstressed. So we speak of stressed/unstressed syllables, stressed/unstressed vowel sounds and so on. Now, if you search for "accented" in the dictionary, it will give you the definition of "stressed", but I think stressed would be more appropriate for this task. And indeed, there is also another ambiguity about this: in some languages, not all stressed syllables bear accents (diacritics) and vice versa.
