Reactors benefit from economies of scale. It costs almost as much to make a reactor for one house as it does to make one for ten houses. This would be a very inefficient policy. There isn't enough uranium in the world to supply widespread use for any reasonable length of time. You could use thorium which is much more common but it has other issues (that you may be able to hand wave). 

Osteoderms are bits of bone material within the skin. The saber tooth tigers in the American southwest (there were many, independent, instances of "saber tooth" tigers) developed their long fangs just to get through the thick hides of sloths and some other large mammals. For extinct ancient species, the ankylosaurus or any similar species will fit the bill. 

As @F1Krazy, no crime can be a selling point. One side benefit of a well run tyranny is stability. After the somewhat recent chaos in Romania, there are many who wanted Vlad Tepesh back: because there was no crime. And that's true. One story is of a foreign merchant who ask Tepesh for some guards to protect his goods. Vlad was incensed by this saying that no one would dare steal it. He then ordered the merchant to leave his goods on the street corner for a few days. After those days were up, upon inspection, nothing had been touched. As long as the police don't dare commit crimes against the populace, they will be seen as a social positive. Now, lets take the question title into account: How to have a competent police force in a low crime society. Competent compared to what? The criminals won't have a lot of practice. Sol the police simply have to be better than the criminals and get them off the streets before the criminals have a chance to gain experience. 

One thing that devils could ask for are for the person to preform actions that put other people's souls at risk. Note that doing this will actually taint the deal makers soul as well so the devil is getting two benefits instead of one. Like put something valuable out where it would be the target of theft by people who are decent (bonus for kids) to see if you can get someone to start down that path. Bring 3+ people to the devil to make deals. This is especially good if the person is being used to get near someone more important. A variation of the above is to have the person perform a series of actions that back someone else into making an even bigger deal with the devil. To max that one: start a feud between two groups so the devil can make deals with members of both groups. It could even be as simple as in the morning going to work, cut people off in traffic and when the light turns green, sit there until it turns yellow again and then cross the intersection. Thus you cause a number of people to be angry and, maybe, make bad decisions throughout the day. 

Landing a craft on a planet requires breaking. Even if you start out at zero velocity relative to the planet, you have to partially counter the planets acceleration due to gravity or you will do all of your deceleration at once (a less than ideal situation). The two main ways of decelerating while landing on a planet with an atmosphere are thrust based breaking and atmospheric breaking. Thrust based breaking requires enormous amounts of fuel. It isn't like a Falcon 9 coming back down after launch because you still have the payload.To launch a rocket, it takes 15 to 40 times the weight of the vehicle and payload. When coming down, there will be some atmosphere breaking even of that isn't the main means of deceleration. So, lets be generous and say that it takes 10 times the weight of the vehicle (including crew and payload) to safely land the ship. That is a lot of fuel to still have left at the end of the journey. That much force will require the vehicle to be heaver to deal with that stress (adding more fuel). A narrow base like a normal rocket would require a lot of energy to be generated from a very small area (relative to the mass of the vehicle). A flatter, more spread out shape, like a disk would allow the thrust to be spread more evenly but would greatly increase the structural requirements of the vehicle. It is also likely that where ever the ship lands will be a barren, cooked, hellscape. Aerobreaking (atmosphere breaking) is possible but the engineering of that (heat and stress) would be massive. Creating a set of parachutes to cover an object that massive would be daunting. For one thing the object would alter the air flow around it making groups of small parachutes difficult to design. A single chute that is massive enough to ignore the airflow around the ship would probably have to be made out of some sort of unobtanium. If the vehicle is coming in "hot" instead of breaking to "at rest" relative to the planet, it will require a heat shield to slow to a speed that the parachute can operate (and not cause the initial tug of the chute to splat everyone on board). This is even more weight that has to be added. It also means that the vehicle should be designed with some sort of symmetry or it will start to tumble from the uneven air pressure. Another method of aerobreaking is the lifting body. This will fly or glide down. The trouble is that the less aerodynamic it is, the faster it has to go and the longer flat spot you need to find to land on (I recommend water landing for this). The more aerodynamic it is, the more wing you have hanging out there to get ripped or burned off during initial aerobreaking (more structure, more mass). Some sort of combination of all of these might be the best bet. It is also almost certain that any such large vehicle that lands will not be taking off. 

It would happen, I think that it would just take a bit longer. Aside from increasing the speed of collaboration, the "internet mindset" has increased the expectations for speed in our culture. There was computer communication before the internet. For anyone old enough to remember it, we had BBS nets with file sharing, forums, and mail protocols like FIDO and usenet. Individuals with a bank of modems would set their computer up as a server. Then you would upload your files or messages to that server. Once a night (usually), that server would then call another server and send its files there, eventually getting to its destination. Because of the timing of when the servers would call each other, it generally took 3 days to get a message from the west coast to the east coast of the US and 1 day to get messages going in the other direction (note the times may be reversed, I'm relying on memory). So, collaboration could and did happen. I was on a number of anti-virus, networking, and science fiction forums at the time. We solved problems together but it took longer. If you needed speed, you overnighted a floppy but that didn't happen much. People were OK with the pace. For one thing, you had time to compose your message and make sure that it said what you wanted to say. Video conferencing would still happen but it would be much more expensive and the quality wouldn't be as good. However, it would work for large company/university collaboration. To answer the "how" question, it would just take longer. If you want it to take the same amount of time, I recommend having a war. War always spurs tech growth. We have the lasers that power our fiber optic networks (and many other things) because of SDI (the Strategic Defense Initiative or the Star Wars Program as it was called). [Edited to get the name of SDI right.] 

You can solve the extra goods problem by making extra goods available to people who work extra hours, perform unwanted jobs, or take critical function jobs. Are there enough of those jobs for everyone who wants one? Are there enough extra resources to pay for those? If the jobs are limited, how do you decide who gets them? Those handing out the "extra" jobs will have a lot of power. The only way I see this working is the "human zoo" type of society. This is where one class of society controls all aspects of the other class who have no power. Historically these were called Masters and Slaves. You will probably want to choose different names for the classes to obscure the reality. 

It is likely that any substance that would have a physical effect on him would be lethal to anyone else. It would have to be exotic and, as you pointed out a "specialized venom." That would mean that someone would have to target him specifically and that they would then have a lot of control over him since there would only be one source for his fix. Anything can be psychologically addictive. If french onion soup brings back vivid memories of good times with his dead wife, he might not be able to function without his french onion soup. 

Money is power. If money is directly inheritable, you can keep growing wealth. If not, then hiding funds knowing that you will eventually remember the hiding place would be the way to go. In modern times, that includes the account numbers of bank and investment accounts. Compounding interest will make anyone who lives long enough very wealthy. However, if everyone was doing that then the effect would be nullified (as inflation would increase by a proportional amount). 

For sex's primary purpose? No, unless you had some kind of high speed fluid transport system. For sex's other purpose? Maybe. If you could include sensations beyond just the sight and sound of current systems then yes. If not, then it is just another form of porn and that would work for any individual as well as the standard kind does. 

As far as wind resistance is concerned, regardless of shape, the faster you go the more wind resistance you face. So, to minimize wind resistance, go slow. Attaching to rails is one way to slow yourself down and regain a great deal of the energy. 

They can start by making wood and stone tools. Those supplies are easy to come by. That should hold them over until they can make metal tools that will last longer. So, an axe to chop the wood and a knife to shape it. Metals can be mined with a pick like the old miners did. As has been mentioned, metal should be pretty close to the surface if you can find it in the region. So, the minimum tools would be an axe, a pick, and a knife. Everything else can be found or made. A shovel and a saw would be handy too. 

Yes but not as extreme as the Earth's. The Earth gets some if its seasonal difference from its orbit taking it closer or farther from the Sun. This would still affect the Moon. However, the Earth gets more seasonal effect from it's axial tilt (look at Australia vs US/Europe). That would not happen. So, there would be some effect but not a lot. You would probably get more of an effect from the fact that the lunar "day" is about 28 Earth days long. That would produce a pretty hot spot that will travel slowly around the Moon. 

Most if what I've read treats a wormhole as a portal, so you would simply cut the vessel in half (messily, not cleanly, would be my guess). If the wormhole takes a duration to transit, shutting one down should take time. The shutdown would start at one end and traverse to the other. It would dump the traveler out the still open end. Note that if the process is messy, and they could end up being broken down to sub atomic particles on the way out. If the shut down is instantaneous, it's dealers choice since I can't think of any physics that would allow the shut down to be instant and have non-instant travel times. Do you want them to end up in a random location? Do you want them to be in some alternate reality? Do you want them to be torn into sub-atomic particles? 

The Egyptians (my favorite, BTW) would be screwed. They would be convinced that their rigid class system is the best and that everyone should adhere to it. Unfortunately, without the Nile and the power that comes from being able to predict the floods, they have no power base with which to influence people. Add the fact that they were hideously bad at war and they would go down soon. They were protected by miles of desert on all sides. Their idea of tactics was to arm all the farmers with pointed sticks or clubs, line them up and run at the enemy. Meanwhile, the only effective weapons (bows and chariots) were reserved for the few nobles. Every culture on you list that I know anything about would eat them for lunch. The Greeks would conquer those they could and trade with those who do not look like an easy conquest. 

The trouble with flechettes is that their light weight would cause them to lose speed very rapidly due to air resistance. This will be an even bigger problem at 3 atmospheres. What you need are the heaviest slugs with the smallest cross section you can get. Depleted uranium would be best, if you can get it. If memory serves, they tried flechette ammunition for shotguns during the Vietnam conflict and determined that they were very good for removing leaves from trees and that's about it. There might be a more effective modern equivalent. Small, sharp, teflon coated sub munitions might be good for getting through kevlar if there are no inserts but hard armor would just bounce those off.
