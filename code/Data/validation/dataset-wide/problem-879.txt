The source is Sco X-1. It is a point source of X-rays. I'll have get back to you on why it looks that way in chromoscope, but it looks incorrect to me. 

Perhaps this analogy is apt, or perhaps not... Sometimes when you go out to the car on a cold winter morning, the windscreen looks clear, but there is actually a supercooled film of water on it. As soon as you start up the engine, the vibration disturbs the unstable equilibrium, the water freezes on the windscreen, the phase transition occurring at points and spreading. At the same time latent heat of crystallisation is released. I think the idea is meant to be that our universe could be in that supercooled state and that there is actually a more energetically favourable phase that the (false) "vacuum" could be in, but the transition to that new phase would release sufficient energy to drive a new bubble of cosmic inflation. 

e.g. DecRA=24.35417 $${\rm RAh} = {\rm INT}(24.35417/15.0) = 1$$ $${\rm RAm} = {\rm INT}((24.35417 - 1\times 15.0)\times 4.0) = 37$$ $${\rm RAs} = (24.35417-1\times 15.0 - 37/4.0)\times 240.0 = 25.00$$ DecDE is the decimal declination DEd, DEm, DEs are the dms form posneg is -1.0 for a position below the celestial equator (negative declination) and +1.0 for above the equator 

What exactly did the book say? It all depends on what you mean/define as "curvature". What you describe appears to be a description of the behaviour of $\Omega$. Inflation does indeed drive $\Omega$ towards unity and simultaneously flattens space because the radius of curvature grows exponentially bigger. If $\Omega < 1$ at some early epoch then it should decrease quickly with time such that $\Omega << 1$ in the present day - this means that the universe has negative curvature, but does not mean it is becoming more curved. In the Friedmann equation, the curvature parameter $k$ is a constant $(1,0,-1)$ $$H^2 = \frac{8\pi G\rho}{3} - \frac{kc^2}{a^2}$$ Here, the spatial curvature is $k/a^2$ and the radius of curvature is $a$ if $k=+1$. Thus as the universe expands and $a$ gets larger, any curvature becomes smaller. In a little more detail - one can write the above equation in terms of the density parameter $\Omega$, the ratio of density to the critical density $3H^2/8\pi G$: $$(\Omega ^{-1}-1)\rho a^{2}={\frac {-3kc^{2}}{8\pi G}}$$ During inflation, the energy density $\rho c^2$ remains constant as $a$ grows exponentially. In order to keep the left hand side equal to the right hand side (which is just a collection of constants), then $\Omega$ must be driven very close to unity, while $k/a^2$ will tend towards zero. After inflation then $\rho$ will vary with $a$ depending on whether the expansion is dominated by matter ($a^{-3}$) or radiation $(a^{-4})$. In both these cases $\rho a^2$ will decrease as the universe expands, such that if $k \ne 0$, then $(\Omega^{-1} -1)$ must increase, which means that $\Omega$ must either grow or shrink away from unity. But $k/a^2$ continues to get smaller as the universe expands. 

Any book on Cosmology published prior to 2000 does not contain the results or discussion thereof of the WMAP and Planck surveys of the cosmic microwave background. These constitute the best constraints on cosmological theories, including the relative contributions of dark energy, dark matter and the flatness or otherwise of the universe, and the best supporting evidence for the big bang model and for inflationary ideas. The 1994 book may not even contain the Nobel prize-winning esults on the cosmic microwave background by COBE, which was the first to see in detail the ripples that the later missions used to perform precision cosmology. 

Assuming you mean the angle between the meridian line through A and the great circle that goes through points A and B, then it goes something like this. Define vectors from the origin to A and B assuming they lie on a unit sphere, such that $x_A= \cos \delta_A \cos \phi_A$, $ y_A = \cos \delta_A \sin \phi_A$ and $z_A= \sin \delta_A$, and similar for B. Here $\phi$ refers to right Ascension and $\delta$ is declination. The great circles in question define planes that pass through the origin. A normal to the plane defined by OAB is given by the vector product $\vec{n_1}=\vec{A}\times \vec{B}$. Similarly a great circle passing through the O, A and the NCP $(0, 0, 1)$ has a normal of $\vec{n_2}= \vec{A}\times (0,0,1) = (y_A, -x_A, 0)$. The angle you are looking for is the angle between these two normal vectors, which can be found from scalar product in the usual way. $$\cos \theta = \frac{\vec{n_1}\cdot \vec{n_2}}{|n_1||n_2|}=\frac{\cos \phi_{A}(y_{A}z_{B} - y_{B}z_A) + \sin \phi_{A}(x_Az_B - x_Bz_A)}{|\vec{A}\times \vec{B}|}$$ 

A black dwarf might be defined as a cooled, compact object with a temperature and surface area that are small enough to make it invisible in the optical part of the spectrum, with most radiation emerging in the infrared. However, because there is always some radiation in the short wavelength Wien tail of a spectrum this definition would be distance-dependent, so instead you could define a temperature below which you could argue that so little light emerges at visible wavelengths that it would be dark. Again, this is somewhat distance-dependent, but also depends on the size of the object. In practice, at astronomical distances, cool compact objects like old white dwarfs and neutron stars, or low-mass and older brown dwarfs are invisible at optical wavelengths when their temperatures fall significantly below 3000K. At 3000K, the V-K colour of such objects is $\sim 6$, meaning they are 25 times as bright in the near infrared. This increases to $\sim 100$ at a temperature of 2200K. There are lots of brown dwarfs (particularly the T-dwarfs) that can only be seen in the infrared. The coldest known white dwarf is probably older than 10 billion years, has a temperature below 3000K, and has not been detected at optical (or IR) wavelengths (Kaplan et al. 2014). There are likely about a billion or so old, cold neutron stars in the Milky Way that cannot be seen via electromagnetic radiation at all unless they interact with something else. The Wikipedia definition of an object so cold it doesn't emit light is simply unworkable. All objects above absolute zero will emit electromagnetic radiation (light) and it is hard to see how an object could cool to below the cosmic radiation background. 

The Sun orbits in the Galactic potential. The motion is quite complex; it takes about 230 million years to make a circuit (meaning an orbital speed of around 220 km/s), but at the same time it oscillates up and down with respect to the Galactic plane every $\sim 70$ million years and also wobbles in and out every $\sim 150$ million years (this called epicyclic motion). One can also measure how the Sun moves with respect to the average motion of the stars in the solar vicinity - the so-called local standard of rest. Estimates of the Sun's motion with respect to the LSR vary a little. According to Dehnen (Walter!) & Binney 1998 the Sun moves at 10 km/s inwards, at about 5 km/s faster than the average star tangentially to the Galactic centre and at about 7 km/s upwards out of the Galactic plane. Though as I mentioned previously, these motions are of an oscillatory nature around the mean value. We could cast our net wider and ask how fast Sun moves with respect to the standard of rest defined by the cosmic microwave background - the local cosmological rest frame. The Sun moves at about 370 km/s relative to the CMB in the direction of the constellation Leo (as revealed by the dipole-like anisotropy in the CMB temperatures).
