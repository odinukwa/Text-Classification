It happened when I "stepped on it" (on an empty residential street). It left the chain on the road. What tool(s) and parts should I have had with me, to fix it? It was replaced (new) two months ago, since when they also had the back wheel off to replace its brake pads. When I lubed it recently I noticed that one of the links seemed loose, but I didn't want to take the time to take it back to the LBS (which is now on reduced less convenient winter hours). 

It's do-able. We have some guests, a couple in their 20s or 30s, who both know how to cycle but aren't accustomed to it. They were able to go somewhere and back, 25 km each way. Caveat: 

Apparently, when I squeeze the brake lever then the brakes close on the disk, and when I release the brake lever the brakes don't open again far enough to completely clear the disk. When the noise happens it's slight but more-or-less continuous ... it doesn't sound as if only happens over part of the wheel's revolution. Shining a torch/flashlight through it from behind, I can see daylight on one side of the disk but not the other ... so apparently, one of the pads doesn't retract off the disk. Looking at the rear brake I can see daylight on both sides. I tried re-seating the wheel (to try to ensure it's sitting equally on both forks), which made no difference. Do you (might I) expect a symptom like this if it's been too long since it was last serviced? I don't understand the internals of hydraulic brakes: I can change a tire but haven't touched brakes. Is it something I could maybe fix, e.g. a screw to turn to adjust it, or should I take it to the bike mechanic? Maybe this is the service manual for the brakes. Reading it, I see it says (towards the end), 

[This maybe ought to be a comment but it's probably too long for a comment] How long are your rides? Maybe the thing to manage is heat, not moisture. On a hot sunny day you can plenty wet (from sweating while biking) On a freezing winter day you could get too wet/sweaty too, by biking in a too-warm winter coat without ventilation. If it rained while the temperature were 28C in the tropics, you wouldn't necessarily want a jacket then that could make you hotter. I used to commute 1/2 hour each way, rain or shine, hot or cold (in Toronto where 'cold' means about -15C), and instead of worrying about how wet I am (and when it pours, it really really pours), the thing to manage is how warm I am. FWIW I always have short-sleeved cotton shirts and jeans, and on top (to insulate my 'core') wear a variety of anoraks or windbreakers (e.g. with Gortex and a mesh interior lining that helps to keep the sweat off), winter coats (e.g. with down filling), polyester/fleece waistcoats ... typically with zips so I can vary their ventilation. 

What combination will let me back up the pedals? It depends: whichever gear you were in when you were last (most recently) pedalling, is the gear in which you can back-pedal. When you change gears and pedal forward, the chain slips onto the corresponding cogs. When the chain is on the corresponding cogs (the cogs which correspond to the current gear selection) then you can also back-pedal. The one thing you can't do is: 

Can you tell me anything about this? Lens materials, frame styles (with specific examples), or anything else? 

Until I growled the other dog didn't realize that I was anything at all, didn't know I was even a player. It's not that dogs are cowards necessarily, but consider this: wolves hunt animals larger than themselves: sheep, deer, caribou. But I don't think you'll find them hunting bear (or man). Someone advised me once, if you ever find yourself alone with wolves in the wild, don't run away in fear: because whether or not you run from them is how they decide whether you are prey. Instead just continue to go about your business, and let them go about theirs. As for the amount of fight you have in you: 

If I'm on the bike then I behave like a vehicle (i.e. I cross the intersection like a vehicle should, using a traffic lane not using a cross-pedestrian cross-walk). 

Is it normal to stop so much because of thighs burning? Are you using gears? The "cadence" means (it's defined as) the number of times per minute you do a full revolution of the pedals. A good cadence if you're not wearing bike shoes is maybe 60 rpm? When you go up-hill, your cadence shouldn't really change. Instead you change to a lower gear, and keep on with your regular cadence: use your gears so that it's constant cadence, constant force on the pedals (not pushing harder), therefore constant effort (energy output), just a variable bike speed (because of the gears); it shouldn't be much harder for you on a hill (just slower). If you're "pushing" too hard (exerting too much force on the pedals) then again, switch to a lower gear: so the bike will slow down but, again, you keep your cadence constant. In the extreme (if the gear it too low) you can be "spinning" up-hill: in the lowest gear, barely any effort to turn the pedals, the usual cadence, and (because you're in the lowest gear) travelling at around walking speed. I notice your bike has only 16 speeds, maybe a road/racing bike. Don't be afraid to use a lower gear on hills, that's what they're for! I think (I'm not an expert, this is only personal experience) it is unusual for thighs to burn. When I'm exhausted my legs just become kind of like jelly: not painful (burning), but nerveless, I can't push them anymore. And for what it's worth, before I became fitter my lungs gave out before my legs did. If the hill is sufficiently long and steep then I'm panting and eventually stop "to catch my breath" rather than because my legs are sore. I think I have 27 gears, and I use my lowest gears on steep hills (e.g. a gradient of more than 10%). Those "compact" gears you have might be intended for "hard men" and masochists and so on (or, well, for regular racers). Here's an estimate of some numbers by the way (YMMV of course): 

I was walking my mum's dog off-leash on a road, and another dog ran to attack her. I was surprised by the attack, because the dogs there are normally trained to stay (and bark) on their own property, and never go onto the road. Anyway, as it was running towards my dog to attack, it ignored me entirely: until I voiced a great big growl: at which it suddenly noticed me for the first time, and stopped. You're bigger than them. You have a right to be on the road. They'd have to be crazy to attack you. There's a saying (I think they say it about sportsmen): 

Sit back when braking When you're braking hard, and especially if you brake when going down-hill, sit back as far as you can: lean forwards, stretch your arms out, and push your bum back to behind the saddle. Doing this will help to keep you from going over the handlebars. 

If you have a medical condition though you should probably talk with your doctor. High blood pressure sounds to me like a risk of stroke, low blood pressure like a risk of fainting, neither of which are healthy while you're cycling in traffic. On the other hand, it's possible that cycling is (if it's good for your health) therefore less of a health-risk than not cycling would be. 

My bike (2010 Kona Dr Dew) came with 700x32 Continental Contact tires. I've had the bike for 3.5 months so far: i.e. about 160 hours of commuting. I've had 1 flat so far (front tire): caused by an impressively sharp, 3/4 inch nail through the tire. I don't know what tire could withstand that. When the bike tech replaced the tube for me (my first flat: I wanted to watch how he did it) I asked whether it had Slime in it and he said no: it's too heavy. I don't always bother to avoid bumps and cracks and small pot-holes: apparently the wheels can take it. The tires are OK on snow, too, going a bit cautiously; though not on ice. They say 85 psi on the side. I try to inflate them to 95..100 psi each weekend, and they measure at 80 psi by the next weekend. 

Apparently someone once asked a champion whether it's better, in a race, to push hard and slowly in a high gear, or to spin more easily and quickly in a lower gear: and he thought about that and said, "It's better to push hard and quickly in a high gear." Similarly (and here again, I'm guessing) improving stamina might not be to do with practicing either often or for a longer time, but both. 

Cycling Performance Tips - Leg, Knee, and Hip Pain is all about knees. It includes different reasons and corrections for e.g. anterior versus posterior pain. It has a section on treatment towards the bottom, which starts with, "Knee pain generally develops slowly over a number of days and is not an emergency" and "physician rather than walk-in clinic." For rehabilitation it suggests, "Take a few days off and then ... cut back mileage by 20 - 30 % and spin at a high rpm and in a low gear for a week or two." For prevention: don't get cold, get the right fit/posture/biomechanics (as explained earlier in the article), have a cadence of at least 75-80 rpm, and avoid "big changes" in training (saying that a risk factor is increasing mileage by more than 10% a week). 

My bike is a Dr Dew. When I first bought it, to commute 2 hours/day, for the first couple of months I had it, I noticed the weight on my hands. This is fixed by: 

In practice (i.e. now from experience), for the riding I described in the OP, I found that I need the following maintenance.
