The age of the universe as we know t is very hard to determine. Current estimates put down the age f universe to 13.5 billion years +/- 0.8 billion. This is a huge a margin of error when compared to the margin or error you speak of. Also it will never ever be possible to measure the age of universe because: 

So for now one can say that we and the sun are not part of any binary star system which has been (if it exists) undiscovered till recently 

During the early days of the solar system there was a high abundance of matter in the early solar system. Easily enough to form the planets and a lot of matter to spare. Also during the initial stages of formation of the solar system matter was distributed very densely when compared to what the density is today. At that point there were lots of asteroids and other small bodies very close together therefore at that stage local gravitational fields played a major role in formation of the planets. rather than the sun As for the asteroid belt. It cannot form into a planet because the matter density is very low and its proximity to the giant Jupiter makes it very vulnerable to its gravitational field. The gravitational fields between the asteroids are simply not enough to coalesce them together into a planet due to very large distances (between the asteroids) involved 

Although astronomy is very cool and the things we are learning are awesome, is there really any practical use to knowing the things we know about the universe? Do other fields of science draw from the current tome of astronomical knowledge? 

I think it's important to note that finding life and finding intelligent life are 2 different things. We might expect there to be unintelligent life on a significant number of planets, but the number of factors to create intelligent life are exponentially less plausible than just creating life. We must also factor in the very real possibility that any life intelligent enough to discover E=MC2 will quite probably destroy themselves. The cosmic window of any intelligent life could be very small, and the chances of any 2 planets with intelligent life at the same time could be remote. Although homo-sapiens have been intelligent for a few thousand years, we've only really discovered how to send our message into space in the last 50 or so years. There is a good chance that our species will die out in the next couple of hundred years (global warming, nuclear threat, super-bacteria, etc). 250 years is not even close to a blink of an eye in cosmic terms. 

$URL$ We think of a gas as something very . . . well, airy. After all, air is the gas we all know and love. We breathe it and fly planes right through it with no trouble. So it makes sense to think that a gas planet must be like a big, airy cloud floating out in space. Saturn in true color. The bigger a planet becomes, the heavier is the material weighing down on its center. Think of how it feels to dive under water. If you are wearing a face mask, you notice that as you dive deeper, the mask presses harder and harder on your face. Also, your ears start feeling the pressure even at 2 or 3 meters (5 or 10 feet) below the surface. The pressure you feel on your body is due to the weight of the water above you. The deeper you go, the heavier the water above you and so the greater the pressure on your body. Even on Earth's surface, each square inch of your body experiences 14.7 pounds of pressure due to the weight of the atmosphere above you. If you could dive down to the center of Earth, the pressure on your body would be about 3.5 million times as great! The center of Jupiter is more than 11 times deeper than Earth's center and the pressure may be 50 million to 100 million times that on Earth's surface! The tremendous pressure at the center of planets causes the temperatures there to be surprisingly high. At their cores, Jupiter and Saturn are much hotter than the surface of the Sun! Strange things happen to matter under these extraordinary temperatures and pressures. Hydrogen, along with helium, is the main ingredient of Jupiter's and Saturn's atmospheres. Deep in their atmospheres, the hydrogen turns into a liquid. Deeper still, the liquid hydrogen turns into a metal! But what's at the very center of these planets? The material becomes stranger and stranger the deeper you go. Scientists do not understand the properties of matter under the extreme environments inside Jupiter and Saturn. Many different forces and laws of nature are at work, and the conditions inside these planets are very difficult to create in a laboratory here on Earth. But you can be sure that you wouldn't be able to fly through these bizarre materials! As we now know, the gas giants are much more than just gas. 

It sounds like the question is asking if there can be two separate contributions due to the expansion, one simply because the distances are increasing so successive wavefronts in the wave train arrive later and later, and a second effect due to more esoteric distortions like time slowing down. But what of the redshift we attribute to something happening to space, and what we attribute to something happening to time, depend on the coordinates we choose to describe what is going on. The standard choice is comoving coordinates, where time has the meaning of "age of the universe at the point in question in a frame moving with the average gas." In those coordinates, the elapsing time isn't doing anything different as the universe expands, so the only effect you need to worry about is the stretching distances between wavefronts. 

I think you can actually experience the answer to your question by going out into the deep wilderness late on a night where there is no Moon, make sure no artificial lights are anywhere nearby, and simply observe. That's how dark it is in a reasonably random location in the Milky Way! It will be very dark indeed, but you might still be able to see something (other than the stars, of course). It's a good question-- can you see your hand in front of your face by starlight alone? I don't think you can, but I haven't done the experiment! 

I was watching the new Cosmos and Neil DeGrasse Tyson said something that made me go hmmm... He mentioned that the only reason that the Earth did not experience the runaway greenhouse effect like Venus is that life had evolved to the point at which it could feed on carbon and take it out of the atmosphere and deposit it in solid form as limestone. The question is, if we were to find a planet in the Goldilocks zone, how likely is it that it would be habitable for life without already harboring life? Would we expect that a similar scenario would have had to taken place on that planet to curb the greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere, thereby turning it into another Venus? Can a carbon cycle exist without life? 

If our solar system were to somehow be created outside of a galaxy as a single star in the vast nothingness between galaxies, would life on Earth change any? Does being a member of a galaxy actually provide some kind of benefit to our solar system or the creation/sustaining of life? 

Whenever we hear an explanation about the big bang, it is always phrased in such a way that it was an explosion which used some kind of pressure to expanded the universe out. I wonder, however, would it be possible that our universe bubble started as a point that wrapped around the singularity and contained it. Then, for some reason, this bubble started to expand, which caused the energy in the singularity to fill the newly created empty space. Could it be that this bubble, which is now our universe, is still expanding, and the universe is still trying to fill the space, which is why we see dark energy? Could we even know, or would either way look exactly the same to us? 

These measures of today may still have a huge margin of error but they are the best we have till date. And to narrow the error down to about even a few years would take us a lot of time and tremendous development in technologies. So basically we have a very slim chance of determining the precise age of the universe in the foreseeable future 

Our planet should have been affected by it because a star is a much larger mass when compared to the planets. Since the star and our sun interact with each other they would produce a noticeable wobble. Any such star would definitely be very close to the sun so as to be able to influence it and hence easily visible yet no evidence has been found for this. 

Since every object in the known universe which has mass has an infinite gravitational field every object in the universe affects one another. Every star in our surrounding affects Our solar system but the relative proximity of the sun masks these effects to us. However if the sun would be a part of a binary system of stars 

The universe started according to the big bang theory and if we take it as true it gives us a near infinite radiation density. We could measure the expansion and try to estimate the age but it is still hazy as we have no way knowing the initial density of the universe. There is always an uncertainty in any measurement. and measuring something so far away(The edge of the universe) will have a lot of uncertainty. 

One should distinguish the "Roche limit" from the "Roche lobe," as the latter is what you need when you have two objects of similar mass, like a binary star. The Roche lobe is an effective equipotential in a frame that cororates with the orbit of the binary (assumed circular). The equipotential is "effective" because it includes both stellar gravities, and also the centrifugal force from the rotating frame. The Roche lobe is not only an effective equipotential, it is the last one that is closed-- any equipotential further out connects to infinity and cannot correspond to material in equilibrium that is corotating with the orbit. From the side, this last equipotential looks like a kind of infinity sign. Material outside that "infinity sign" has to start moving in the rotating frame, bringing in coriolis forces and in generally leading to complicated motion. However, if close to the Roche lobe, the gas tends to flow through the nodal point at the center of the "infinity", so tends to be transferred from the domain of gravitational attraction of one star to the other. That's "mass transfer." Setting up the calculation of the Roche lobe is fairly easy because you only need the two gravities and the centrifugal force at the orbital period. But it is a difficult set of equations to solve, and even at the research frontier, is usually approximated rather than calculated exactly. No doubt this is the source of your difficulty. Why one star fills its Roche lobe is a consequence of stellar evolution, often as one star attempts to evolve into a red giant or asymptotic giant. Before it can reach its giant radius, its outer layers encounter the Roche lobe, and pass along it through the central node (the "Roche point") and may ultimately end up attracted to the other star. This is what is thought to have happened in Algol, for example, which is a binary where the star with the greater mass now started out as the star with the lesser mass (because it gained from its companion). The rate of mass transfer is also difficult to compute, because it depends on how fast the mass-loser is evolving. It is only its evolutionary rate that causes the "Roche overflow," so the mass transfer rate is pegged to the evolutionary rate, which is largely due to rate of fusion that adds mass to its core. 

Long ago, it was theorized that light had to travel through a medium, until the particle/wave duality of light was discovered. Then it changed to the idea that light can travel through the vacuum of space as a particle. Light travels at different speeds depending on the medium that the light is traveling through. It travels slower in water than it does through air. However, is there any possibility that dark matter is a medium that light travels through? Could it be conceivable that what we recognize as light speed is really just the speed at which light travels through this medium? If we were to remove dark matter, would light go faster? 

Since the Sun's temperature will continue to increase and it is estimated that in ~2 billion years it will be so hot on Earth that life will be impossible, I'd say it's going to evolve more toward Venus. 

When a proto-star becomes a main sequence star, is that something that happens in an instant when a certain threshold is met, or is it a process that takes a few thousand/million years? 

Say a photon left one of the first stars ever created in our universe. This photon has been traveling for 13+billion years through the vastness of space without ever hitting anything. Sure, it's probably been tugged at by gravitational interactions, but it's still happily traveling at the speed of light without direct interaction with matter. As we know, most of the universe is composed of mostly empty space. The odds of any single photon hitting something (like the Earth as starlight, etc) would seem to be very small. What will eventually happen to this photon? Will it eventually reach the other end of the universe, and if so, what would happen to it there? 

You are right that what you must use as a referent is different-- for parallax, your referent will be a much more distant object, because it shows little parallax. In aberration, it happens to the whole visual field. But what is shifted is the angle relative to the ground at which the light arrives, so if you set your telescope to see a given star, in principle you would need to correct for both parallax and aberration as the Earth orbits. But aberration is usually much larger than parallax because it scales with v/c rather than D/d (where D is 1 AU and d is the distance to the star). For the Earth's orbit, v/c is about $10^{-4}$, but stars are much farther than $10^4$ AU. As for Bradley's observation, a good version is given at $URL$ He was looking for the parallax effect, and stumbled into the much larger aberration effect. He could tell it was something different because the sign was opposite and it did not depend on distance to the source. This was 50 years after Romer, so the speed of light was already known. 

There are two separate issues when you talk about a star's age. Are you talking about its absolute age, in years, or its age in terms of how far along is it within its own evolution? The difference is, massive stars go through their evolutionary phases very quickly, and low-mass stars very slowly, so essentially all very low-mass stars are older in years than essentially every very high-mass star. Also, you can know more than the "spectral type" from a spectrum, you can also know the "luminosity class"-- that's the roman numeral that tells you if the star is, for example, a main-sequence dwarf or not. So if you pick an M spectral type main-sequence star, and an O spectral type main-sequence star, as two stars at random, it is extremely likely that the M star is much older than the O star, and you can know that purely from the spectral type and luminosity class. But if you want to know the age of the M star, or the O star, in years within their evolutionary stages, then it gets more difficult because there is rather little main-sequence evolution in the spectrum. There is some evolution though, especially late in the main sequence, so you could tell its age if there is evidence of main-sequence evolution in the spectrum (for one thing, the luminosity rises with age, within a spectral type, but that's pretty hard to tell from the spectrum). If the star is both low-mass and early in its main-sequence evolution, the best way to tell its age is to look at the rotational broadening of its lines, as low-mass stars spin down rapidly as they age (due to strong magnetic fields and weak winds). Another good way to tell the age of stars is if they are in clusters that all formed together, you can look at what is called the "main sequence turnoff", which basically means you look for the lowest mass star that has gone supernova, and you know how long that takes for that mass of star. You tell this from the spectrum because the turnoff is in the "Hertsprung-Russell" diagram, which you make from the spectra, but it requires a lot of stars in the cluster, so it's not really a property of a single spectrum. So the bottom line is, you need a suite of different techniques for assessing the ages of stars, it is not always easy or straightforward but you can take each case individually and look for ways to infer age. Much easier is determining which evolutionary class a star is in, because stars change dramatically in one phase or another, and the spectrum alone can tell you if you have a dwarf or a giant, etc. (Basically, the lines get much narrower as a star puffs out in radius, because the pressure drops.) 

I was listening to Skeptics Guide to the Universe the other day, and Steve Novella mentioned that the escape velocity for the galaxy is 544 km/s. If an object fails to reach escape velocity on Earth, it will return to Earth. What will be the fate of an object, say the Voyager spacecraft which is currently traveling at 17 km/s, that fail to meet the 544 km/s. I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around what galactic escape velocity means. Does this mean that Voyager is incrementally slowing down by the pull of the galaxy? Given enough time, will it end up in the supermassive black hole in the center? 

Earth is traveling at a certain velocity. Earth orbits the Sun at velocity X. The sun is orbiting the center of our galaxy at velocity Y. The galaxy is orbiting (something?) at velocity Z. On and on... In relation to zero, Earth has a velocity of X + Y + Z + (?). Is it theoretically possible that there would be a point in space where nothing is moving and velocity is essentially 0? If so, what would time look like at this point in space? 

Regardless of how big or small, how hot or cold, do all stars have a goldilocks zone, and if so, could any given planet in this zone (with the right configuration) support life?
