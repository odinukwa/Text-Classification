Note just bowmen... The quality of archers, their training, and their equipment did vary. Inexperienced bowmen would be of very little use on the battle field and could even be a hindrance to the side employing them -- friendly "fire" really is not. Bows, as anything made of wood, is sensitive to the weather. Scotland is well known for their rains, cold winds and general miserable weather. It is possible (although I have no real references) that leading to the battle of Bannockburn, the weather was so bad that the bows were of little use. As is true of many battles, the morale of the troupes, their training and supplies did play a major role. However, I am no expert in those particular battles so could be wrong. 

Though the title may be vaguely broad, I have two specific things in mind I wanted to ask about. While I was recently considering the cultural and technological advancements of Europeans in the early Middle Ages, which was soon to be spread by them to the New World, I also began to consider Islamic history and cultural advancement at that same time (especially - for them - in areas of science, literature, and mathematics), and particularly in North Africa where some of the the Portuguese had contact and intermingled with Muslims through trade. So along parallel historical tracks I began to wonder at the comparative development between Renaissance Era European culture and Islamic culture at that time, and pursuant to that a few unusual questions arose in my mind. In particular I was wondering about two innovations of the Europeans of which I have never heard mention of their first use in the Islamic world (in terms of their initial adoption, though of course in the modern world there is hardly any distinction now): Firstly, use of the printing press; and secondly, the use of canvas (hemp-weaved) for painting (which first took off in Italy). In terms of technological advancement I'd say the former is more significant and utilitarian, while the argument about the "sophistication" of using canvas for art seems more subjective and preference driven (whatever its actual practical and aesthetic advantages may have been), though I still am curious about it. So to plainly state my two questions: 

Throughout the Wei invasion, Lu Xun stayed in position blocking Liu Bei's invasion path. By the time Wei forces lifted the siege due to rampaging disease, Jiangling was on the verge of surrendering, and relief forces scrapped together from elsewhere were repulsed every time. Lu Xun's inaction demonstrates how potentially formidable Liu Bei's surviving forces still were, at least in the minds of Wu's leaders. Given the tactical and strategic advantages in Shu's favour, Liu Bei's invasion had at least some chance of success for retaking western Jing. On the other hand, pushing further east would have been an entirely different question; the extra distance significantly shifts logistical and terrain advantages in Wu's favour. If Liu Bei intended the Shu invasion to conquer all of Jing or even Wu itself, then you could say the invasion was doomed. The Shu navy's depleted state would by itself rule out conquering beyond Jiangling. That said, forcing a negotiated settlement seem like the more likely plan on Liu Bei's part. Note also that Liu Bei's invasion was not "hasty" by any means. The Shu province was captured in 214. Kuan Yu was defeated and killed in 219. It took until 221 before Liu Bei launched his invasion. By this point Liu had administered the Yi province for 7 years. For reference, Liu began his conquest of Yi a mere 4 years after taking control of Jing. 

Tim Blanning The Pursuit of Glory has a whole chapter dedicated to this covering Europe between 1648 and 1815. It covers costs, travel times, and road availability as well as water ways. However, that is just a narrow part in time and local. 

The major change from the Republic to the Empire was the decision to keep for life as the head of state first Caesar then Augustus. Thus it put the top job in the hands of one man as long as that man was alive. There was no peaceful way to remove the Emperor at this point and since they controlled the army (or they would not be emperor) they had military power over the rest of society. The change from Kingdom to Republic was maybe more subtle but put two men in charge instead of one. Thus allowing for a balance of power at the top. Again, this is a break with the previous regime. In a similar way, you could say that the 4th of 5th French Republics are the "same": president, prime ministers, ministers, parliament, elections, yadda. Or that the French and English prime minister have the same function. Overall, you would not be too wrong but the devil is in the details. Thus why we refer to the Roman Empire, the Holy Roman Empire and the Byzantium Empire as different beasts even though they are all called "empires" and come from the same root. 

Japan was traditionally friendly towards the Ming dynasty. During the Manchurian conquest, many in the Tokugawa Shogunate wanted to dispatch an army of 40,000 strong to assist the beleaguered Ming defenders (in response to the request of Nicholas Iquan Gaspard, in the name of the Longwu Emperor). This was forestalled by the rapid collapse of Chinese defences and defection of Nicholas Iquan, but Japan continued to provide limited material support to the Ming remnant in Taiwan. Consequently, the belief that the Taiping rebels were fighting to end the Manchurian occupation created favourable first impressions in Japan. Several works of fiction were produced around this time, for example the New Tales of Yunnan , depicting the restoration of Ming China in a war of liberation clearly inspired by the Taiping rebellion. As more news reached Japan however, it became apparent that the Taiping Rebellion was primarily a religious conflict. Coupled with the widespread destruction and bloodshed the rebels were inflicting, Japanese opinions soured. For example, the Samurai Hibino Teruhiro, who was part of a delegation to Shanghai in 1862, writes that: 

One Byzantine churchman and scholar who wrote widely on Greek classics and also made reference to the Suda was Eustathius of Thessalonica. In the Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece by Nigel Wilson (pg. 60) it says: 

In terms of broadcast technologies, which was seen as more revolutionary for its time: television or radio? How was each technology utilized in terms of its intended purpose and audience/users in its earliest years? And were telecom companies its earliest providers, presumably having already provided telephone services and telegraph long before that? Also, was the invention of broadcast technologies seen as a surprising and significant development from prior point-to-point communications like telegraph and the telephone, or was it more of an expected logical progression from those precursor technologies? Lastly, many communication technologies seemed to be developed for government or military purposes first and only later considered for public use. Was the same the case for either radio or television? I'm trying to get a feel for how it impacted the societies in the era they were each invented, including early adoption and enthusiasm surrounding their use. 

This was not because black GIs were more likely to commit rape (which isn't to say it wasn't more likely, mind you - just that they were disproportionally punished for it). Black soldiers were at risk of being scapegoated on a personal basis for the crimes of their white counterparts. 

It is short for . I think the English equivalent would be something along the lines of "annex" or "appendix". As in, "Appendix B, Vol II, Proceedings of the School Conference of 1891". I don't believe this is a general history convention. As far as I can determine, it's mainly a German usage; the example you gave is also citing a German publication. 

Depending on your definition of corporation, you could claim that Venice and other merchant cities of Italy were akin to corporations. Guilds could well be said to have been pseudo corporations and the Templar orders a pseudo-bank. Corporations allow for a united front against competition, taxes, and a sharing of profits. The Merchant Adventurers of York (founded in 1357) are another example of a union of merchants. 

I believe that the scene is 13 Warriors is taken from the account of Ahmad ibn Fadlān ibn al-Abbās ibn Rāšid ibn Hammād (Arabic: أحمد بن فضلان بن العباس بن راشد بن حماد‎) detailing his dealing with Northmen. This was a inspiration for Michael Crichton's Eaters Of The Dead which was a source for 13 Warriors. 

EDIT: I thought that Alexander assumed emperor-esque Persian royal titles, and a brief book glance seemed to corroborate. Upon further investigation that appears to have been a popular misconception. Thanks to @fdb and @YannisRizos for pointing it out. 

Whether he was sincere or not, Chang affirmed his support for Chiang as the leader of China. By his submission he sought to help repair the blow to Nationalist authority he himself delivered. Yang was much less willing to ingratiate himself with the Generalissimo. Even though he technically received an even more lenient punishment ("sent" to Europe on a government tour for research), the deposed general continued to be highly critical of the Nationalist Government in general and Chiang personally in particular. Once the Japanese invasion began, he snuck back to China with some designs on acquiring a military command again, and was promptly seized. His hawkish attitude during the crisis, and subsequent failure to behave, probably doomed him and his family. His death wasn't so much a punishment as it was an assassination, marked by a strong element of vengeance. 

A stele was found in the area of ancient Moab from the 12th century B.C. during Pharaoh Rameses II's domination of Canaan, which depicts a local ruler flanked by two (possibly Egyptian) gods, and the stele is made in imitation of the Egyptian style. 

When was the first recorded use of a printing press in Muslim lands? (Note: I am not asking what the first Islamic book printed on a printing press was, given that it might very well have been from a printing press operating in Europe. I want to know about actual adoption of the printing press in Muslim lands.) What is the oldest known Islamic work of art composed on canvas?
