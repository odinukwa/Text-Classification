Mike Mentzer, a former mr Universe (only one with a perfect score), ate around 100 grams of protein daily. He questioned bodybuilding dogma (and was probably the most controversial bodybuilder ever) and reasoned it made no sense to eat a lot of protein because protein wasn't used for energy like carbs and fat are. That means it isn't dependent on your activity levels. I suggest reading How much protein by Brad Pilon (author of Eat Stop Eat), where he analyzed lots of research on protein intake. Among other things he mentions that in scientific research "high protein" means 0.55 to 0.7 grams per pound. In bodybuilding "high protein" is 2-3 grams per pound! He says the protein intake should be between 70 to 120 grams per day on average, even for steroid users. Here's one more article for you to check out: $URL$ Remember that it's the supplement companies that own all the biggest muscle magazines, and that they use those magazines to advertise their own products. The supplement industry is a billion dollar business! How do you think George Hackenschimdt became one of the strongest men ever to live in the beginning of the 20th century, with no supplements whatsoever? All he needed was hard work, good food and lots of rest, and the same applies to you and me. 

There are app's such as SyncMyTracks that attempt to synchronize your workouts with a dozen of the main providers, and the majority of app's are adding the ability to sync with at least one of the aggregators eg. Google Fit, Apple Health, MyFitnessPal. 

Somatotyping is essentially stereotyping (assigning an “empirical generalization” to an individual), as to whether this is valid / acceptable is another matter, but have a read of: All Stereotypes Are True, Except... I: What Are Stereotypes? Anyway Somatotyping is taught, in English Schools and Universities, as a valid means to assess an individual's suitability / potential to become an elite performer in certain sports eg. basketball, gymnastics, distance running, rowing, wrestler.... Even the BBC covers the technique. It's generally packaged up / taught under the Applied Anatomy or Kinanthropometry banners, and is backed by a number of studies that have shown a correlation between certain physical characteristics and achievement at an elite level in certain sports e.g. 

There doesn't appear to be anything out there that exactly meets your requirements eg. in, Who is Strongest? Adjusting Lifting Performance for Differences in Body Weight, Dan Cleather, MA, ASCC, CSCS it states: 

Gaining weight - if I had 10-20 extra pounds on the chances of my back going out went up exponentially. Dehydration Improper technique - especially on squats but got hurt doing a few other movements. Lifting after cardio/sports. You do not want to lift with "loose" muscles - or lift heavy. Not doing enough core work. Long periods of inactivity. 

I want to mention that I am in no way opposed to Starting Strength. As Dave mentioned, it has a lot of useful tips for beginners. In that it stresses form and core movements it should be commended. However it is highly regarded because there is a press and advertising behind it. They are smart even down to the name... Starting Strength. Meaning no experience required. It takes the results from these starters, who work out hard, gain tons of weight, and follow a strict regimen and acts like these are mind blowing things. 

Do not over-do cardio. 25x5 is PLENTY. I would actually change it to maybe 4x30 to give your body more days off. The key to integrating a cardio program into a new routine for weight loss is what can you do that will not cause your body to go into starvation mode? When you start a new cardio routine or expense a lot of energy/intensity on cardio your body will naturally try to recoup through diet. No use busting your ass on the treadmill to burn 300 calories and then have to eat 500 calories to feel better. Am I suggesting cutting out the cardio? No. What I am suggesting is cutting down the intensity at first until your body is used to the activity. Also I strongly encourage 2 feet up - 2 feet down jump rope. It is low impact and I don't know of a faster way to take off fat. I am not sure about your weight routine. You label what you do but not how many sets, reps, or exacts. In general what you are saying is good. I would also ask your intensity level, how tired you are after lifting, and how long does the soreness last in each body part. Lifting is more crucial to losing weight than cardio - the more muscle you put on the more your metabolism speeds up. Also your metabolism is sky high during recovery. So lift before your cardio not after. Your diet seems protein deficient. You need to add lean meats/beans. I would aim at 35-40% protein - natural. You should not be taking protein shakes to lose weight. Maybe 1 out of 10 of my clients would actually eat less when taking these sorts of supplements. Only even think about taking protein shakes if you know that you will cut out an equal amount of calories out of your diet. Do not starve your body and you really need to make sure you are limiting binges. You have a big routine. You have to eat. You never mentioned calories and you need to start counting. I would not consider you way overweight. I would shoot for losing a pound every week or two. You need to know more about your calorie intake. Make the goal how you look not your weight. If you are working out hard and lifting you will gain muscle. Muscle is heavy. Often initial muscle gain (some water weight) can rival fat loss. It is conceivable that after a year of lifting/cardio/watching what you eat that you weigh slightly less but look totally different. 

There's no specific exercise that will deliver what you ask for, but there is plenty of research showing that 30+ mins or general aerobic exercise will deliver physical and cognitive benefits, have a read of: Neurobiological effects of physical exercise or Shorter term aerobic exercise improves brain, cognition, and cardiovascular fitness in aging. So simply ensure your mildly active on you four rest days. 

Swimming is a good general exercise, as it will work most of your muscle groups, but if you just want to work your core try a combination of: Squats, Planking, and a few Crunch variations. 

Stride length is only really applicable if your attempting to verify / compare the distance covered during a treadmill based workout. The distance given by the other pieces of equipment are pseudo / equivalent distances, to that a treadmill would record for a similar level of effort input, anyway as you've actually gone nowhere they're all wrong ;-) The Fitbit is principally an electronic pedometer, so it's primary purpose is to track STEPS WALKED, if your looking to measure / quantify other forms of exercise, and calories consumed, you're probably better off seeking out a heart rate monitor. For info: There have been a number of studies and articles published that evaluate / estimate the accuracy of pedometers and fitness trackers eg. 

Just to add to Eric's answer the two most important things I look for in a running shoe - I am all treadmill due to nasty shin issues I get running on hard surfaces - are: 

The key to your fitness and your well being is sleep. I started off working all kinds of odd hours including a 6AM-6PM shift, a 40 hour weekend starting Fridays at 4PM, a 4-12AM shift and a couple of others... I can tell you unequivocally it almost near impossible to get good workout results while being tired all the time. It is also almost impossible not to gain wait while being under slept. Your body will naturally try to gain energy it needs (perceived from lack of sleep) through eating more. There is just no way around it. To maximize your time you either need to get to bed around 8-9PM every night or you need to get home right away and sleep until 8-9PM. It probably makes more since trying for the first option since falling asleep in the middle of the day right after you worked is going to be hard. 

A diet will fix the chest fat. Eat a healthy, balanced diet, so: vegetables, grain(but not white flour!), fruit, lots of water(this really helps, my best advice is to drink a glass of water as soon as you urinate. This will make you use the restroom a lot for a few days but after that it'll normalize and you'll simply be drinking a lot of water - that makes the hormone receptors stick further out of your cells' lipid bilayer so they're more receptive), and meat, milk and eggs, but those three in moderation. Dissymmetry with the pectoralis muscles is really common. Actually, I'm sure it's common on all muscles, but the pectoralis are very close together so it's visible. In any case, there's nothing you can do about it. But you still have a layer of fat over them, so who knows, maybe they're actually quite symmetric. Walking and jogging is great. If you aren't doing any other exercising, I'd suggest some bodyweight exercises: pushup, chinup, australian pushups (reverse pushups), planks, wall sits. Also, jump rope is great. 

For men: (height in centimeters) - 100 = ideal weight in kilograms. For women the same but minus 110. As a rule of thumb for natural bodybuilders this is the maximum weight for entering a competition. Of course, not everyone is a competing natural bodybuilder - in fact, my mother taught me this 'weight standard' when I was a kid, and I was surprised to learn that it applies to bodybuilding too. In general, you should strive to weigh that much while being as muscular as you want. Even if you don't have much muscle you'll look good and healthy at that weight. If you actually are interested in natural bodybuilding and that seems light to you, consider you'd be weighing that much with a very low bodyfat percentage... So for a 6 ft male: 182-100=82 kg=180 lbs As you can see, the weight in pounds is actually almost equal to the height in centimeters here, but that isn't the same for other heights. For a 190 cm tall man the ideal weight is 198 lbs, not 190. 

For someone starting out 5-7 mins is just way too long to be sitting around in between sets. You need to be doing something not reading! If you are lifting for pure strength - not size or tone or athletic reasons - than longer break times can work. But not at 5-7 mins per. That means you spent 21 mins doing 15 squats? That doesn't seem efficient. There have been studies done showing that once a person starts an intense workout they have anywhere between 20-35 mins of peak strength building time. After muscles are fatigued (you are making your muscles more tired not necessarily stronger) and the body needs to be replenished. A lot of olympic lifters actually lift twice a day for 30-45 mins each. And yes they do take ridiculous breaks between sets. I don't think you are there yet though. You need to use your time wiser in the gym. Even if you think you have unlimited amount of time your body doesn't. For a beginner 3-4 mins is a long time. Drop the weight, increase the movements you do and the reps, and increase your intensity level. Now once every month or two if you want to have a max out day on a lift you can go ahead and take the long breaks to see where you are at. 

Most of the of the premium / pro offerings provide this eg. MapMyFitness MVP, Runtastic, Endomondo Premium 

Then multiply the result by the total time walked. Still without data from an ECG and face mask based gas analyzers there aren't any accurate equations. If you can guess the duration of your daily walks you could simply use the MET formula to estimate the calories, which will produce a number in the same ballpark as a pedometer based estimate. See also: Walking Calorie Burn Calculator For a bit of light reading: 

Note: RespiratoryExchangeRatio is 5.0 for sugars, but drops to 4.86 for freeing energy from fat. So for the first few mins of relative intensive exercise (ignore the first few secs, as anaerobic, and any fat burning after a few mins, or any sprints that will exceed your bodies ability to process ATP and result in a lactic acid build up) that bit of code appears correct: 

The relationship between your: resting, maximum and recovery rates has been shown to correlate with your bodies ability to consume Oxygen (VO2max), which itself correlates with the conversion of fats and sugars to ATP, to fuel your muscles. So a few pulse measurements is a fairly commonly used and easy means to assess / estimate fitness. Have a read of "101 Evaluation Tests" for a selection of the more common tests devised to exploit these relationships eg. Rockport walking test, 1.5 mile run, 12 min run, the Harvard, YMCA Queen or Tecumseh Step tests.... Note: The equations all produce ESTIMATIONS, not absolutes, but can be a useful means to measure changes in your fitness over time. Re: 

This is just a comment but a rather long one so I can't put it in the comments. There is certainly not enough information in your question to answer the question. Your question doesn't even quantify what it means for a muscle group to grow. Are you defining this by mass or by strength? Lifting is not only personal and factors in sleep, eating habits, weight, intensity, routine and so on but it is also a factor of the other habits of your life that are a bit impossible to quantify. If you are just looking at mass you really have to look at body builders. You gain much more mass when you are loading weight. That is why body builders go on this roller coaster ride sometimes a few times a year. They don't do this because it is counter productive. Then you have to look at your overall body structure. Let's be honest, the bench (and chest muscles) are a shorter man's game. That is why you have a ton of superhuman 300 pound 6'7" behemoths in the NFL that bench 225 just 20-25 times. Their arm length is a hindrance. The tricep failing will disable their chest muscles from growing. But to them... Who cares? It isn't functional for them to bench 600 pounds. They need endurance and speed and flexibility. Let me use my personal experience as an example. I worked out my chest once a week. Really hard but just once a week. At my heaviest weight I was squatting/deadlifting well over 600, cleaning over 320, skull crushing over 150 for sets... My bench never went over 325ish. I could rep 225 20-22 times but could never bench real weight. Why? Because I touched my chest once a week. Every other muscle probably got some kind of work 3 times a week but the chest? It doesn't get used. Double down on that I was playing basketball for 4-6 hours a week at college practice level and running another 10 miles a week - it does not take a rocket scientist to figure out why my bench was never great. Now my chest muscles are in line with my body structure but the weight was never there. So if you want your chest to get big: 

Approximation !!!!! There's absolutely no practical way for any machine to state your actual calorie consumption, and they're aren't even any vaguely accurate regression equations, without data from an ECG and face mask based gas analyzers, to estimate the KCals burnt. Though machine manufacturers try, though the figures can be as much as +/- 40% off. Note: The Kcal values on food packaging, where you can scientifically measure the values, legally only have to be accurate to +/- 20%. 

A common formula for approximating calorific expenditure is: Kcal/Min ~= 5 calories * massKg * VO2 / 1000 Where: 

Yes, given your weight and pace I'd expect a value below 150 Kcal. A way to confirm this would be to plug your details into a couple of the common Kcal estimation equations and take an average eg. The ACSM and MET formula: 

The Flex counts changes in voltages in its internal gyroscope, as an old mechanical pedometer counted swings of a pendulum, to identify movement events. These voltage changes are triggered by a physical change in the gadgets orientation. So if you're stood holding on to a bar or with your arms hanging for the hour there will very few orientation changes for it to count. If this is the case you either need to change your walking style to one with swinging arm movements, ideally emulating a military a march, so there will be an arm swing for each step. Alternatively look for a heart rate monitor, as an app can track activity from an elevated heart rate, or alternatively go for a walk outside, so the GPS in your phone can track some real movement, and the app can have some real data to work out calories from a real distance and speed. Also to quote the help.fitbit.com site: 

I am looking for alternatives to doing effective cardio running in the water. Big plus if there are ways to get all of the same muscles to fire, to scale workouts easily, to be able to have an ultra intense workout, for options that someone with foot or knee issues could do, and a plus if it can be done in most "larger" pools. I would like an answer that does not rely on the runners feet ever touching something. I would like some workout plan examples, equipment needed, progressions, and good insight in the answer! Example use: 

If you want a pretty accurate calorie count you need to use a calculator that is not just height/weight/age based. It needs to be height (helps estimate skeletal, organ, and fluid weight), weight (for ratios), and body fat % (so that you can get some kind of estimate for muscle weight). You don't have to get your body fat % every day but you need to check it during intervals to update your counter. Your muscular weight is going to have a huge impact on the amount of calories you burn per day. Without knowing it the calorie counter is trivial for the athlete or lifter. Most calorie counters either assume a body fat % or they assume that anything over a certain weight for a given height can be attributed to fat (based on gender). When using the counter the calories burnt per workout is very very hard to estimate for lifting weights. There are some decent estimates for basic things like running, walking, activities. These are guesses usually based on your weight. They are OK to use. They could be off by as much as 10-30% though for in-workout calorie burn. For someone 160-180 pounds lifting for 45 mins I would give at least 200 calories. Why not 250 for you since you are looking to gain weight. The afterburn is the real deal. The more intense your workout the more calories your body will burn after your workout (while your body is still cooking) and during recovery. There are studies that bicyclists have burned up to 700 calories AFTER a ride - THE SAME DAY. Didn't even take into account the full recovery process. If you are trying to lose weight, then you can just ignore this afterburn - you will just lose weight quicker. But if you are trying to gain weight you are going to have to really use your best judgement. If your weight workout is at a very high intensity for 45 mins I could see adding anywhere from 400-1000 calories based on your weight/muscle mass. But here is the deal. This isn't a one time one day addition. When I work with one of my athletes and dieticians we normally attribute 60% of the after-burn calories to the workout day and spread the rest through out the week (done so that you fuel your body properly for recovery periods). You work out 3 days. So let's say you calculate your total per workout afterburn to be 600 calories - pretty intense. So you would gain at least 360 calories on the 3 workout days. And then 240x3=720 divided by 7 days = 103 extra calories per day. So a total of an extra 463 calories on workout days and 103 on non-workout days. Simple but easy. You can spread the calories a little more if you want balance but you have to account for them (and you should be eating/drinking more calories on workout days). If you are sedentary at a desk most of the day then pick a very low activity level. But if you go for a walk or anything on a regular basis you need to add it in so that it is accurate. Walking to the store everyday might seem like normal life but it might be 100 calories a day which adds up (maybe with 1 calorie afterburn too).
