First, fire your pilots. One plane should have checked out the contact, not all of them. ID it as your hostile, that plane pulls away and the others fire their Slammers. Second, they should have known Sidewinders wouldn't lock on. Why are they carrying them at all? Third, given how badly they have messed up they should try to break away and come back with the Slammers. Finally, if they can't break off there's still a chance. You said the dragon wanted to burn the planes--that means a fire-based breath weapon. The Sidewinders will track when he's attacking--and go right down his throat. The plane that was being attacked will certainly get fire damage but it might survive anyway--it's an airplane, it's moving fast. I would expect the pilot to at least be able to punch out afterwards, I doubt the dragon can actually burn through the canopy in the time it will have. 

Not only would it not be stable but putting it in atmosphere would increase the instability. The problem is that when one bit dips it goes into thicker air and experiences more drag, increasing the problem. However, it doesn't matter. Remember how the Ringworld was kept stable? Your air processors are going to be pushing so much air that they can be used to stabilize it. You still do have two other problems, though: 1) Scrith is an unobtainium. Nothing is that strong. 2) You're in atmosphere. Drag will slow it down, it's going to collapse unless it's so strong it can hold itself up against Uranus' gravity. 

Lets borrow some ideas from Robert L. Forward's Camelot 30K. Now, as with most of his aliens I see no way they could evolve, but lets go with something much simpler: We have a spacegoing plant (It originally evolved in atmosphere and managed to make the transition as it's planet of evolution slowly lost it's atmosphere and then was destroyed by passing within the Roche limit of a gas giant.) It's seeds are incredibly tough, long-lived and radiation resistant. When one comes to rest in a sufficient (which would be quite low) gravity field the plant sprouts. There are plants that throw seeds but this plant took the idea much farther. It sent down a big taproot that is made out of an explosive. At the end of it's life cycle the plant dies, the root dries out and eventually detonates. The seeds are cast a considerable distance this way, sometimes even at escape velocity (the plant normally grows on carbonaceous asteroids.) At this point a variation arose that used a block of metal in the root to direct the blast better. Denser metals work better, a version evolved that used uranium. At this point it encountered a very young asteroid belt containing uranium that has a far higher percent of U-235 than we have. It still built the uranium blocks in it's taproot, but now it's actually possible for them to go critical. A critical mass does us no good but as it approaches criticality it gets warm, the root dries and detonates. If the blocks are arranged properly they are blown together and you get a nuclear yield. At first it will be small but it throws the seeds much farther than before (and dispersing it's seed is the big issue for this plant), it's a big reproductive help. Better bombs evolve as well as tougher seeds to survive the launch. Interstellar travel becomes likely rather than requiring quite a fluke. Now, one of these seeds has fallen on the planet your heroes are exploring. You need fresh uranium and a decent amount of it but you don't need the sort of concentrations that others are talking about which would almost certainly cook your planet. Now, trapped under an atmosphere the plant can't throw it's seeds offworld but they get dispersed. Now, this plant was adapted for life in space and conservation is it's driving principle, it's life cycle is going to be slow and it's not going to look like a traditional plant. Your heroes will probably mistake it for a mineral formation until the biologists figure it out--and note that messing with a mature one is asking to get yourself nuked. 

Glyphin came close but I disagree. The weapon of choice is not a spiked shield, it's two spiked shields! With his strength the spikes are a good weapon for him and since he's going to be facing a lot of battles defense is more important than offense--he has to live to fight the next battle. Thus spiked shields and heavy duty spiked armor should be his outfit of choice--he will still be a deadly opponent but he won't go down the first time he gets surrounded. 

While I don't have the answers I can give you a starting point: Forget the volume, ignore what the people need to live in. It doesn't matter. The limiting factor will be food production. If the plants are growing directly in the city the needs here are going to be substantial--remember, Mars only gets 60% of the sunlight that Earth does, you're looking at about half the growth rate you would get on Earth. I have read that you can get by with only 10% of the light by supplying only the best frequencies but counting all conversion losses this means an area of solar collectors nearly as big as the growing area if you planted things directly. Fossil fuels are obviously out of the question and nuclear power would be quite problematic because it would be so hard to cool the reactors. (Remember, on Earth reactors are generally on rivers to get cooling water.) Build your dome, the surface layer is pretty much all food crops, the people live underneath. You'll have enough space for the people. 

It's actually quite easy. Look at the stock market--this has been rejected by other posters on the basis that making a correct prediction will change the future. The butterfly effect is certainly going to be an issue. To protect against this you must make only one prediction and at a short range. Have your time machine deliver you to the Oval Office, 10 minutes before the closing bell on Wall Street. I would recommend minimal attire to minimize the nervousness of the Secret Service agents. Arrive, hand the closest agent printout, tell him to keep it secure. The printout looks like gibberish. You then explain that you are a time traveler, come to warn of a disaster. The printout you just provided is the closing prices for every actively traded stock. There is a simple encoding scheme, even if it goes straight to a cryptographer they'll only have a few minutes to work on it--the crypto guys simply don't have time to bring their heavy guns to bear. You make thousands of accurate predictions at once--they'll listen. Popping in from thin air will also help. 

This wouldn't be anything like immortality. You already have about a 40% chance of getting cancer and half of the time it will kill you. (And I believe this is an understatement as they define "cured" in a fashion I don't consider acceptable.) A vastly increased cancer risk simply means everyone dies of cancer. 

I don't think there's any major war for which it would ensure victory by military means. (For non-military ways, see Gary Walker's answer.) The carrier's strike capability will be devastating against high value targets but it's soon going to run out of fuel and parts. Perhaps fuel can be manufactured locally but there will be no possibility of spare parts or ammunition. Soon the planes are down for maintenance and the carrier is no longer a threat. As long as the other side realizes it's a one-off windfall they can ride it out, the historical result should be the same. 

I'm afraid I must go against the crowd and say it's certainly possible. The thing is we have already seen a plague that's killed millions that had this behavior: HIV. The key here is that the disease has no obvious symptoms of it's own, but rather makes you vulnerable to other problems. A readily-spread version of HIV meets your criteria. 

The question makes one big mistake in terminology: "Fallout". An atomic weapon produces a huge amount of hot air that carries the fission products high into the atmosphere where they spread and then fall back. When the cooling ponds boil dry there's no huge circulatory pattern to lift the crud into the sky, thus "fallout" is not a reasonable description of what happens. There will be radioactivity scattered about but with nowhere near the spread that war would bring and with nowhere near the threat level, either. Also, note that in case of war the usual advice is to stay under cover for a few weeks. In the case of a cooling pool that clock was already running long before the rods went in the pool--in other words, it's already run out. Stay away from the pools themselves, beyond that the slight cancer risk is small compared to all the other threats the survivors face. 

The north, easily. There are two battles here: The naval battle and the land battle. The thing is there is no meaningful land battle--the south has no meaningful land predators. Once the north makes a single successful landing of a breeding force the outcome is inevitable. On the flip side, the south has no ability to invade, period. If the south has total naval supremacy they could prevent such a landing. However, they do not have any means of long range reconnaissance, the battle comes down to the entire northern navy vs whatever force the south can deploy locally. Given force that are in the same ballpark the one that can bring it all to bear wins. Thus the north gets it's invasion beachhead. The navy then goes home, the south falls. 

A bit more humane approach than Tr-Es-2b's answer: 1) Design and mass produce a cheap pistol. It's not built for a long service life by any means but it works decently. 2) Leaflet drop over all ISIS-controlled territory: "ISIS has been determined to be a sufficient threat to the world that it will be removed, period. In 24 hours there will be a mass drop of firearms over this city. If ISIS controls this city 72 hours from now the city will be flattened. Starting 30 hours from now tactical bombers will be overhead to reduce ISIS hardpoints that they identify or which become apparent from being sieged by the population." 3) A weapons and leaflet drop over any city under imminent ISIS threat except that it will be flattened if the city falls. 

As Radovan Garabik said, you don't really need infinite so long as it's bigger than you can travel in a lifetime. So long as you are limited to low tech transport that means structures at star-system scales are big enough. Now, for something that comes close to what you're after and doesn't break any laws of physics (but would require some incredible engineering!) Niven's ring as designed is impossible because it requires materials beyond what chemical bonds can possibly do. However, this doesn't rule out all rings. Step #1: Gather a bunch of stars. These orbit in a rosette, the larger the better but you need a lot of stars. Step #2: Build something akin to Niven's ring but instead of the retaining walls the sides simply gradually climb to the requisite altitude. Note that this ring's distance from the rosette is a bit greater than Earth's distance from the sun, the overall ring is much bigger. Step #3: Just outside this build a far more massive ring. The junction between these two rings is a magnetic levitation system. Think of the habitable ring as a truly enormous maglev train except it's a complete ring so there's no start and end. Step #4: Spin the habitation ring, de-spin the ring behind it. You can get 1g on the inside of the habitation ring without super-strong materials this way as the average velocity of ring + backing ring is orbital velocity for it's distance from the center of mass of the system. Results: You have a land that's perhaps a million miles by a billion miles. The inhabitants don't even realize there are edges as the slope is gradual--to them it's simply terrain that gets too high to cross. You have stars that cross the sky from pretty close to the horizon to pretty close to the horizon. (The bigger the ring the closer to the horizon they'll get.) You can even have seasons by having stars of slightly different brightness. I haven't tried to solve this for possible values, I don't know if you can match Earth's day and year. (And if you can note that it means 365 stars in the rosette!) Beware that the ring is unstable and the rosette is unstable. Without some stationkeeping system the whole thing will end in catastrophe in time. Some possible tweaks: You could have a black dwarf in place of a star. The result would be a day that doesn't happen. If the atmosphere is thick enough (creatures evolved for it won't care, flight will require less wing span) you could even have a neutron star in place of a star. No day but the effects of one of it's jets touching the atmosphere would be an incredible aurora. Note that the jets remain at a fixed orientation in space as it orbits and thus will hit in different locations on different passes. You can't have moons but you do see the more distant stars in the rosette, it will never be truly dark. (The nearby ones that have dropped off the horizon are cutting through so much atmosphere that they won't be seen.)
