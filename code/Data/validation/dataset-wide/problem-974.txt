A few elements to complement @Siv answer, and some alternatives hypotheses: Originally the idea was that the Fe2+ oxidation into Fe3+ that lead to the formation of the BIF ("banded iron formations") was an indirect consequence of the increased atmospheric pO2 caused by the photosynthetic activity of, then freshly appeared, cyanobacteria (see e. g. Cloud 1973 which, along with Cloud 1968, are i think the first occurrence in the literature of such an idea). Later, the idea that the cause of the iron oxidation was linked to a specific metabolic reaction involved in anoxygenic photosynthesis (i. e. a different way of fixing CO2 that does not create O2) in bacteria was also introduced (Hartman 1984; Konhauser et al. 2005). Another possibility invoked by Holm 1989 is the active oxidation of Fe2+ by "chemolithoautotrophic" bacteria (using it directly as energy source). Finally, the only (as far as I can see) non-bacterial hypothesis on the BIF formation is that of photo-oxidation (Braterman et al. 1983): the oxidation and precipitation of Fe2+ in Fe3+ being indeed possible without oxygen, in strongly acid conditions with a little help from UV photons.

To give you a quick overlook of the range of hypotheses one can test in modern paleontology you can have a look at the public database of project financed by the DFG (german science foundation). Here is a query on paleontology. Some of them are in german but some others are in english and are usually written in a way understandable by non-paleontologists (since grant reviewers are not necessarily paleontologists) and (normally) the hypotheses are spelled out in the abstract (having written such a grant proposal last month I can confirm it is even supposed to be mandatory). Of course, they might be a bit complex for 8 years old but it might give you ideas on the kind of questions paleontologists try to answer. As @HelderVelez mentioned one of the big question in modern paleontology is to determine to which extent speciations and extinctions are caused by interactions with the environment, interactions with other living beings (the so-called Red Queen Hypothesis) or randomness. One aspect of modern paleontology which has not been mentioned so far in the other answers and that come handy to answer such questions is quantitative paleontology. Many subdisciplines of paleontology (invertebrate paleontology, micropaleontology, palynology) have a very rich fossil record allowing statistically meaningful quantification. The Paleobiology database (found here or here) is a great resource for quantitative data on vertebrate and invertebrate paleontology and can help testing hypotheses on fossil biogeography ("Have the tropics always been a hotspot of diversity"), on mass extinctions ("Did the end-Permian events affected only marine-based organisms or land-based organisms as well"), etc. Quantification can also come from measurements and the hypotheses tested have then to do with the organisms evolution ("is organism X more closely related to organism Y or Z"), ontogeny (one of the big challenge in vertebrate paleontology nowadays being to differentiate what part of the observed morphological variations is due to speciation or ontogeny, i.e. are two specimens from different species or from the same species but one is a juvenile and the other an adult) or ecology ("was organism X herbivore or carnivore", "how was organism X walking" etc). 

The idea of mass extinction is not that recent actually: Cuvier (1798), Buckland (1823) and d'Orbigny (1851) for instance were already talking about global catastrophes in earth history, linked to extinctions. But during the same period, Brocchi (1814) and Lyell (1832) proposed that extinctions of species occurred individually and were a gradual process (either only linked to an intrinsic taxa longevity for Brocchi, or variations in the environment for Lyell). Darwin, following Lyell, also thought that extinctions were gradual and not catastrophic. He also noted the fact that hiatuses in the fossil record or artificial concentration in some strata could show apparent extinction event. The issue with mass extinction is that to demonstrate their existence you need to be able to demonstrate extinction synchronicity and quantify the amount of species going extinct (to show that it is more than just background noise). Demonstrating the synchronicity of one mass extinction is what Alvarez et al. 1980 managed to do thanks to the Iridium layer at the K/Pg boundary. More generally, the possibility of correlating extinctions precisely is something that evolved in par with the evolution of stratigraphic tools, and the 1970-1980s is the period during which high-resolution stratigraphic methods arose (chronostratigraphy, magnetostratigraphy, stable isotope stratigraphy for instance). Quantifying mass extinction is what Jack Sepkoski did with his compendium of marine invertebrates (see Sepkoski 1978, 1979; Raup & Sepkoski 1982, etc.). Today, the PbDb (PaleoBiology DataBase) is the project which focusses on that specific issue (see for instance Alroy et al. 2001). It still remains today the main hurdle in studying mass extinctions.

Concerning the thermohaline circulation: the defining part of it, I think, is the formation of bottom water in the polar regions. The formation of Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) in the Southern Ocean is strongly linked to the presence of the Antarctic Circumpolar current (ACC). The ACC was possible only after the opening of the Tasmanian Gateway and the Drake Passage (between Antarctica & South America) which both happened in the Late Eocene / earliest Oligocene. The ACC is thought to have been the deep, strong current it is today since the Late Oligocene at the very latest (Lyle et al. 2008), so the AABW is also thought to have existed since the Oligocene. However as far as the North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) formation is concerned: it is linked indeed in part to the Gulf Stream and the Northern Hemisphere glaciation. While the latter only occurred ca. 3.6Ma (e. g. Muddelsee & Raymo 2005), the Gulf Stream is a direct consequence of the closure of the isthmus of Panama: the shallowing (and therefore closure to deep current) of the Panama Seaway is thought to have happenned at ca. 4.6Ma (Haug & Tiedemann 1998) with a complete closure at 2.6Ma (Lunt et al. 2008). So it is rather safe to say that the thermohaline circulation as we know it today settled probably around 3.6Ma (therefore mid-Pliocene). Back in the Eocene (55 to 33Ma), the formation of bottom water is thought to have occurred in middle to low latitude (e. g. Kennett & Stott 1990) leading to a very completely different kind of global circulation. The impact on the ENSO (if it existed at the time) is, as far as I know, unknown but since South America was still here to limit it eastward I don't think it ever reached Africa. References: Haug, G.

If you're talking about the chirality of the shell, it has been shown that it was the expression of the dpp gene (Shimizu et al. 2013). More trivially, if chirality had anything to do with the Coriolis effect, all gastropods from the Southern Hemisphere would be sinistral and all the ones from the Northern hemisphere would be dextral. Which is not the case. Shimizu et al. 2013. Left-right asymmetric expression of dpp in the mantle of gastropods correlates with asymmetric shell coiling. EvoDevo, 4(15). 

The process you're describing in the question is the one at the origin of coal. Although coal deposits are known from the Devonian to the Quaternary, they have been 3 major periods of depositions (see Thomas 2013): the Carboniferous-Early Permian, the Jurassic-Cretaceous and during the Cenozoic. So, indeed the Carboniferous is one of the main period of coal deposit but I couldn't find any numerical evidence in the literature that this is the "main" period of deposit. The idea that it is is most likely due to the fact that the western Europe and eastern USA coal mines (hence historically the most noteworthy) all happen to be Carboniferous. But as far as oil (petroleum) is concerned, according to Klemme & Ulmishek 1991 (straight from the abstract): 

The chapter on the Anthropocene (Zalasiewicz et al., 2012) of "The Geological Timescale 2012" quote 3 papers that used artificial radionucleotides as stratigraphic markers: Schwikowski (2004), Turetsky et al. (2004) and Marshall et al. (2007). The first one (Schwikowski, 2004) used them in the context of dating ice cores from Alpine glaciers and the second one (Turetsky et al.,2004) dated peat deposits using various methods including "fallout isotopes from the Chernobyl accident and nuclear weapons testing". Unfortunately I do not have access to these 2 papers and therefore can't really go in the details. The last one (Marshall et al., 2007) used them to date salt marsh from England. They used specifically 137Cs and 241Am (both, according to them, can be however affected by industrial discharge from nuclear powerplant), but also more interestingly a 14C "bomb spike", following Goodsite et al. (2001). Indeed 14C records shows a substantial increase from 1950 to 1963 (USA and USSR both stopped atmospheric nuclear weapons testing in december 1962), followed by a steady decline toward nowadays values. Goodsite et al. (2001) reports that the 14C can be used for dating at least in all the Northern hemisphere. 14C bomb pulse dating seems to be since then a rather popular method in forensics as well judging by a quick google search. 

Just a shot in the dark, as the journal in which this article has been published has no online presence and is not available in paper form in my institution, but it might refer to an article by a Richard L. S. Taylor from 1990 called 'The Damocles Hypothesis', published in the journal "Space" (journal edited by the University of London it seems). Follows the abstract of that article: 

It is based on compilations from Royer (2010) and Beerling & Royer (2011), using a wide variety of proxies, but mostly fossil leaves stomata for the Cretaceous. It might be a bit outdated now but most articles out there do give values on the same range: ca. 400~500 ppm at the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary and values fluctuating between 500 and 1500 ppm before that, with a maximum during the mid-Cretaceous. As for $p_{O_2}$, I couldn't find a recent compilation, but according to Poulsen et al. (2015), estimates for the Cenomanian (i. e. the high $p_{CO_2}$ period from the last graph) vary widely from 10% to (indeed as the other answer suggests) 32%. Here is the quote: 

As a complement to the two other answers, the work of van de Meer et al., 2012 is worth mentioning. In this article, the authors tried to explore the Triassic-Jurassic plate tectonic evolution of the Panthalassa Ocean (currently all remaining oceanic crust in the Pacific Ocean is Cretaceous or younger). They localized a serie of paleo-subduction zones (that they called Telkhinia) using paleo-volcanic arcs that are now accreted to the north American and east Asian continents. Additionally they used seismic-wave tomographic models of the mantle to identify the remnants of the subducted plate. In their reconstruction the Panthalassa is thus divided in two oceanic plates, Pontus and Thalassa ocean, Pontus being the one that got completely subducted. 

$\varepsilon_{Nd}$ (i. e. the relative deviation of $\frac{^{143}Nd}{^{144}Nd}$ from a standard) is often used as a proxy in paleoceanography to identify the basin of origin of oceanic currents. But what is the model behind this idea? Is this proxy purely empiric? Why would the Neodymium isotopic ratio vary among basins and why would this variation be stable in (geological) time? 

As has been abundantly said in the comments and on meta, there is no proper answer to this question in the current state of knowledge. But indeed we can at least check if we can come up with a rough estimate (and thus try to see from where this 20% estimate comes from). Let's first look at the main known glaciations: 

Modified from Cramer et al. 2009 by adjusting to the Gradstein et al. 2012 timescale. In black, it is the Pacific trend; in blue the North Atlantic and in green the South Atlantic. This graph shows the Cenozoic variations of $\delta\ce{^{18}O}_{Cibicidoides}$ according to Cramer et al. 2009. This proxy is thought to vary according to variations of deep sea temperature (to simplify) and thus should reflect the climate state at a given time. As negative values of $\delta\ce{^{18}O}_{Cibicidoides}$ corresponds to warmer temperature than positive ones, the graph is oriented accordingly. I highlighted the beginning (33.9Ma) and end (23.03Ma) of the Oligocene in red. The Oligocene starts with a rapid cooling (linked to the East Antarctic glaciation, see for instance Kennett 1977, Zachos et al. 2001, De Conto & Pollard 2003). Yet as you can see on the graph the temperature is still warmer than the late Miocene to Recent period. Some regional trends then show a moderate warming at the end of the Oligocene that culminates in the middle Miocene climatic Optimum, ca. ten million years later. 

Credit: Paul C. Sereno Theropoda is the group from Eoraptor to Euornithes. While Eoraptor is Triassic, the group diversifies mostly during the Jurassic (still Sereno 1999) and it is also during that time that we start having "common" feathered dinosaur fossil evidence (e.g. Zhang et al. 2008, Sullivan et al. 2014). Birds (Aves) seem to have appeared in the late Jurassic / early Cretaceous as well, but modern birds (Neornithes), i. e. birds with living representative, appeared only in the late Cretaceous. I don't know of any proper (sample-standardized, with coherent bias detection and removal) paleodiversity study for the theropods, although there is one for Aves (Brocklehurst et al. 2012), so it's hard to discuss about it at a species level. In theory, feathers are more likely to fossilize than other soft tissue (Davis & Briggs 1995) but in practice they are mostly found in finely grained sediments such as limestones, thus limiting the amount of outcrops in which they can be found.
