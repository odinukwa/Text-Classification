There is also the alternative of considering deadlifts on back days, and having a separate leg day with squats. However, if you're unsure, err on the side of caution, and have only one leg day. If you feel super ready to have two leg days (i.e. having deadlifts on back day), then research (or come back and ask for) some tips on that. 

It sounds overwhelmingly likely that the caloric deficit that lead to the 3kg/2weeks was a bit too much. (For reference, caloric deficit means we consume less calories than we spend per day.) If your goal is continued weight loss, I would recommend adding some more carbohydrates to your diet. Yes, it means increasing your caloric intake, but like I said, it sounds like your low caloric intake is causing your lack of energy. A very good way of adding good carbohydrates throughout the day, is chomping on some fruit every now and then. If it's been a couple hours since your last meal, your blood sugar might decrease, causing a feeling of low energy. Fruits are high in natural sugars, and will help combat that, and provide a boost in energy. When we lose weight too fast, it's very likely that a good portion of that weight loss is muscle atrophy. If, instead of losing 3kgs over two weeks, you start to lose 1kg every two weeks, that's a far more healthy rate of weight loss. 

Wow, you're lucky! Kudos to your gym for acquiring one of these. I wish my gym had one too. What is that? It's commonly referred to as a "bamboo bar" because of its resemblence. It's actually plastic, as I'm sure you've surmised if you've tried it out. Eric Spoto (one of the best bench pressers in the world) is a strong advocate for incorporating the bamboo bar bench press into your routine, because of the instability it causes, which in turn forces you to activate a lot of the balance muscles that usually don't get a lot of focus. How do I use it? He advocates using quite low weights, and going for 3-5 sets of 10-15 reps. There's really no point trying to measure your 1-rep max on such an auxilliary exercise. This is for volume, and to train those hard-to-engage muscles. In terms of "how do I even?", you use it like you do with a regular bench press. Same setup routine, same prep, same execution. It's just more unstable. Another benefit is that if your bench technique isn't very good, it will let you know very quickly that you have some flaws in your setup. And more importantly, working on this variation will help resolve those issues. I highly recommend watching this video, where Eric Spoto himself takes the time to instruct and demonstrate this movement. $URL$ 

Welcome to the Fitness SE! First off, well done on your weight loss so far! It takes a special kind of endurance to lose weight at that rate. Now, when you say that your weight loss has stalled, do you mean it has stalled completely? It is very likely that as you began lifting weights, your body started putting more of the diet into use, because when you lift weights, your muscles are going to need way more protein in order to recover between sessions. My recommendation is that you try to keep your calories-per-day count, but try to shift it in a way that your protein ratio is higher. Some of the most protein rich sources for vegetarians are quinoa (if I'm spelling that right), seitan, buckwheat and hempseed. My sister is also a weightlifting vegetarian, and swears by these. Additionally, I would like to point out that losing weight will always come down to caloric deficits. I.e. spending more calories than you eat. If you have indeed stalled when eating 1800 calories a day, I would wager that this is a very temporary issue that will resolve itself. If the issue persists, you may want to try to spend more energy by taking some walks on rest days for instance. Most people tend to focus a lot on their daily caloric deficits, but it's the long-term deficit you really notice. 

The same principles apply whether you're a 20 year-old, 40 year-old, or a 60 year-old. Exercise is always good. The only difference between the age groups is the amount of intensity you should allow yourself. In general 

I would never have specific arm days namely because of what you said; they get engaged heavily on back/chest days respectively. If you want to get some more arm action going on, you could instead add a bicep segment to the end of your back day, and a tricep segment to the end of your chest day. That way, they're already warmed up, and probably even tired. But that's good! Because when they're already tired, you get more out of each repetition you do. As an example, I always do a couple of bicep curl variations on the end of my back day. I.e. after pullups and a bunch of row variations. Equally, I do some tricep isolation movements at the end of every chest day. Having a designated arm day isn't something I would put into a routine. But I wouldn't be opposed to doing it every once in a while, in case I really don't feel like going with the plan for the day. 

Initially, this is a matter of taste. If you haven't foam rolled before, then it can hurt. In that case, the first one distributes the weight more, and will be less painful. But if you want to reap the real rewards of foam rolling, then you should be doing it with the gridded one, because it will dig deeper into and between the muscles. Additionally, when you're more used to it, I highly, HIGHLY recommend advancing to the rumble roller, which focuses the pressure even more for that real massage feeling. 

Your best bet is to do one-legged stuff, as any weight added will have double effect. Some good one-leg exercises for a bigger butt; Lunges One leg bench squat You can add weight without proper weights. Fill a couple buckets with equal amount of water and hold one in each hand, for instance. Or get any ol' bar with some light weights. Such sets are usually very affordable. I'm talking 20lb bar, and some small metal plates. These are made for home use, and as such, are very small, but dense. 

I'm going to disregard the whole "limits" part of the question, because limits are different from person to person (genetics), and it's unanswerable on an individual level. As far as training 3+3 hours per day, it's not unheard of. But as you correctly point out, you should be eating plenty of food throughout the week/month/year if you plan on attempting this. Make no mistake, working out for 6 hours per day is NOT something I would recommend for a beginner. The amount of food and sleep you need for your body to recover from this is huge, and if you're a thin guy, it's very likely that you don't have the appetite to eat as much as you should, and the whole project will backfire into projectile vomiting. Best advice Stick to the tried and true methods. Get a regular training program, a proper diet, and sleep 7-8 hours per day. Don't overcomplicate it too early, because you might... no, you WILL burn out.
