With fully pulling you mean the lever touches the handlebars? Simply tensioning the cable and checking the pads should be enough. You should also make sure the cable is properly clamped on the brakes. 

If you don’t have any medical neck issues this is probably related to your position on the bike. Before you try any drastic measures I’d suggest playing around with the seating position. First of all make sure your saddle is in a good position. You should be able to ride with your hands hovering over the handlebars. Raising the handlebars is probably possible and should help too. Maybe because of your braking problems you are constantly looking forward and never relaxing your neck? Try to look down from time to time and change hand positions on the handlebars (that’s what road handlebars are great for!). Braking power could probably be greatly increased with new, good pads and cables. I’ve noticed that keeping my neck muscles warm helps too. It can also take some time to get used to it. Try to keep the first rides short and relaxed, take short walking breaks, especially before/after longer descents. 

You can try to lower the pressure further, but 2.8bar (40PSI) is already quite low for a 38mm trekking tire. Expect snakebites (pinch flats), increased rolling resistance and cracked sidewalls. There is no hard limit and if your rims are wide enough, handling shouldn’t suffer too much. You could upgrade to wider tires if your rims, brakes and frame allow for it. More flexible tires (e.g. cyclocross tires) would be a bit more comfortable and better at handling low pressure. However, they are generally less puncture resistant. On a sidenote: A more relaxed and active riding style helps a lot. Try to avoid potholes or at least get out of the saddle! 

Obviously it depends on the tire, how much you’ve ridden, your power/weight and driving style. Surface and tire pressure probably also play a role. Touring or road tires can last something like 10 000km while soft cyclocross or mountainbike tires can be worn down after only 1000km of asphalt. The rear tire usually wears much faster because it transmits acceleration power and tends to skid when braking. 

Be visible, be predictable (e.g. obey the rules, give hand signs, avoid sudden turns or braking) and leave a safety margin for the errors of others (e.g. don’t ride too close to parked cars). Personally I prefer riding on roads like any other vehicle and with quite a bit of distance to the curb. Edit: I forgot “be attentive”. E.g. Look over your shoulder when doing a left turn. I’ve been overtaken on occasion despite indicating with my fully outstretched arm. 

If you already have the usual tools and clothing you can always need more of the typical wear parts: Tires, tubes, chains, brake pads, chain oil, cables, pants … Otherwise I’d start with a proper stand pump, mini pump (for on the bike), tubes, chain tool, hex keys, lock, bottles, helmet … Clothing is of course essential but hard to guess the right size for ordering. 

Ride more and longer. You are not at the point where you have to think much about training methodology. Just make sure your bike fits you. If you want to go far and fast you might also want to invest in a proper road bike. The only thing about long rides (>1.5h) I didn’t realise for quite some time is that (light) food is very important. Bananas, soft drinks, dried fruit etc. (or you can mix maltodextrin and glucose into your water). On a long, intense ride you can easily need ~100g carbs and a litre of water per hour. Carbs, protein and sleep afterwards are important too. Bicycling is one of the few sports you can easily do for hours at considerable intensity, completely draining your body’s carbohydrate storage. 

120 psi (8.3bar) is good, just make sure to check it every second day or so. Road tires lose pressure fast. As for training: Bicycling is mostly a matter of kilometers (or hours) per week at some intensity. Of course proper regeneration, good nutrition (enough protein etc.) and structured training with intervals, endurance training etc. etc. help. For starters just try to get your weekly mileage up and try to ride at least every second day or so. You should also make sure your seating position is good (especially saddle height) to avoid problems. 

For me noise is a good indicator of “bad” gears with cross chaining. I also know from the speed when I have to change chainrings. 

First of all: You mention that the placement of the bottle mount is bad. There are adapters which allow you to mount a bottle cage without frame holes. E.g. SKS Anywhere, Minoura or this set. All look rather flimsy though. Mounts for the handlebar or behind the saddle usually look more sturdy, if you have space there. There is also the Salsa Anything Cage which allows you to mount and tie down anything anywhere. If a better, more vertical mounting point for your existing bottle cages doesn’t solve the problem, maybe you should get better bottle cages. For example I use these Elite bottle cages with various normal ~800ml bicycle bottles on my cyclocross and I’ve never lost a bottle (except in a 40km/h crash, but that doesn’t really count). They also seem quite popular. 

If you are healthy (no heart disease etc.) and the bike fits you properly (saddle high enough etc.) you almost can’t overdo it. Bicycling is pretty easy on joints, sinews and ligaments. 6 miles (10km) sounds little but depending on the circumstances it can take you almost an hour which is totally okay for a workout. For people who spend lots of hours per week at relatively high intensity, overtraining can become an issue. As a beginner you are probably much more limited by saddle and muscle soreness (during and after exercise) than anything else. Make sure you get enough water and carbs during and after the ride. Get enough rest, listen to your body (a bit of muscle soreness and exhaustion is okay, real pain or dizziness is not) and you should be fine. 

Not much: A mini pump mounted on the bike, spare tube, tire leavers and the hex keys you might actually need in a Frame Bag. 1.5l of water with carbs (glucose and maltodextrin) as food. For longer rides an extra plastic bag with enough carbs for another 1.5l in the jersey. I’m usually experienced enough to pick the right clothing for several hours or a whole day. When the weather is a bit cooler I’m mostly using arm/leg warmers which can easily be rolled up or stored in the jersey pockets. For colder weather around or below 0°C (273k) a good softshell jacket is surprisingly flexible and rarely gets too warm. Overshoes and gloves are important for long rides in colder weather and almost never get too warm. For rides in the mountains I installed a third bottle cage to carry a raincoat (its stuffbag has the shape of a bottle), since the weather can get really harsh and unpredictable there. I hate carrying heavier stuff in jersey pockets and would highly recommend some kind of frame bag or saddle bag. 

No For a given pedal force the chain is under less tension when using the biggest chainring (think of a lever from the pedal spindle to where the chain runs). This also means less force on the sprockets and if using a small sprocket it also means less force/torque on the back wheel. Edit: As Peter Cordes in the comments added: For a given sprocket and speed (i.e. power output) the chain tension will be the same, independent of the chainring. With a small chainring you’ll pedal fast and lightly while with a big chainring you’ll pedal slow and powerfully but the chain will move at the same speed and will be under the same tension. Pedaling slow but powerfully will of course put more load on the pedals, crank arms and bottom bracket. The highest load possible is probably when you accelerate with all your power from a standstill using the smallest chainring and largest sprocket. You can try to minimize wear by using a relatively large chainring + relatively large sprockets. The larger the chainring/sprocket the slower it will wear, since there is more material (assuming they are all made out of aluminium, sometimes the smaller ones are made out of steel for this reason). I dimly recall a test in a bicycle magazine where the larger chainrings allowed for more efficient power transfer, which is interesting because the rear derailleur’s spring will put the chain under slightly more tension which should actually increase friction and make it less efficient. They theorized that this increased tension resulted in reduced vibrations, which in turn increased the efficiency. All that being said: Use a gear where you feel comfortable and can pedal at a fast enough speed, otherwise your knees and other joints will suffer and you’ll tire faster. Generally >70 crank rotations per minute are advised, with ~90rpm often considered the optimum. Bicycle parts are easier to replace than joints.
