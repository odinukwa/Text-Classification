This notion is known as the Badge of Shame, and has been used by various cultures at various times, with various levels of success (for varying definitions of success.) You'll find a fair amount of historical and anthropological literature on the subject. From a theoretical standpoint, I don't think you'll find too many people actually proposing it. 

Not that I am aware of; Wittgenstein's private language argument shows why the notion of a purely internal "language" doesn't make sense. 

Sure, there are lots of things that fit in your category-- there's nothing particularly unique about the case of God (and it's not even one case, as there are many, many different conceptions of God, each of which can be argued separately.) First of all, any ethical claims are going to be outside the bounds of "proof", because "is" does not imply "ought". Second, anything that involves interpretation is going to be very difficult to prove, because in order to do so, you need to first agree on an objective standard against which to measure interpretations, and the grounding of this objective standard is open to all kinds of epistemological/ontological problems (the attempted solution of which often leads to onto-theology, bringing us back to the start.) Third, any problems which are not falsifiable, such as questions regarding eternity, or many cosmological questions (such as what there was prior to the big bang, or what will come after the universe contracts to a point.) Fourth, any questions regarding why things are, beginning with the classic "Why is there something rather than nothing?" Fifth, any questions regarding the foundations of logic. (This may be excluded by your mathematical objection, but I'm putting it here just in case.) We cannot use logic to prove that logic is well-founded. I could go on all day, but in order to cut this short, let's reverse the question: what kind of problems actually are provable? We can start with the notion of falsifiable propositions, but we then have to narrow this down further, as many of these are only falsifiable based upon standards of observation which we may not be able to meet. Further, any proofs are going to be ultimately based upon unproven axioms, and unproven methodological techniques. So, at the end of the day, very little is provable, depending on the strictness of your notion of "proof." You stipulate that "there is a real world and we can ever better comprehend it", but in doing so, you raise the very question you are claiming to investigate. Just as there are competing arguments for the existence and non-existence of God, none of which are completely probative to an observer unwilling to accept certain axioms, so are there similarly competing arguments for the existence or non-existence of the coffee cup on my desk. In other words, the fact that the existence of God cannot be conclusively proven or disproven is not an additional claim in support of the non-existence argument. (Sorry to disappoint...) 

Yes. And the same is true of almost every noun you can think of. How do you decide what is or is not a tree? 

Because it is such a recent work, I doubt you're going to find a lot of literature beyond book reviews. If you have access to an academic library, I suggest that you do a search in the Philosopher's Index, which will help you find any reviews or articles published in the major journals. The only review I've found online is this (largely positive) one from the NDPR. 

I'm afraid I don't have the patience to work through your proof in detail, but I will mention that problems of this nature are more easily solved by Lewis Carroll's "Game of Logic" schema than by other formalizations-- in fact, I suspect that the example was drawn from that book. It is out of copyright, and a scan can be found here; I'd highly recommend it if you are interested in logic, as Carroll has a knack for drawing out the unexpected. 

Believe it or not, this is actually reasonably close to some interpretations of the primary teaching of the Madhyamaka school of Buddhism. The key term of art used there is Śūnyatā, usually translated by "emptiness", which is also the word for "zero". This, if framed properly, actually is quite profound. 

There are several factors at play in your question. It appears that you have (re-)discovered the distinction between implicational and non-implicational negation (also sometimes known as "choice negation" and "exclusion negation"). The literature on this topic goes back to ancient times: for example, Indian logic (both Buddhist and Nyāya) draws a distinction between prasajya negation (i.e., "This is not a brahmin") and paryudāsa negation (i.e., "This is a nonbrahmin"). In the former case, we are negating a proposition; in the latter case we are negating a term. So, when we say "The number seven is not green", we are not implying that it is some other color. Note that this is completely orthogonal to the subject of "meta-logic." In other words, your choice of the word "illogical" as an example seems to be leading you to second-order logic (which may be your goal), but it is not necessarily linked to your questions about negation (which also apply to first-order logic.) I'd recommend a good undergraduate introductory logic textbook, but I'm afraid I don't know what's in current use these days. 

From a philosophical perspective, we would say "Location"-- but yes, every physical object exists at a particular location at a particular point in time. 

I think the point of the Extended Mind Hypothesis (at least, as laid out by Chalmers, et al.) is to problematize the distinction between "Mind" and "World", and suggest that the line between the two is necessarily fuzzy. Language can certainly be used to argue along these lines, although Chalmers (et al.) tend to use externalized memory as their preferred example. Note that there are a large variety of ways of understanding this problematic; perhaps the most radical is that of the Buddhist Vijñānavāda (or Yogācāra) school, and their notion of Vijñapti-mātra (Mind-only, or mere consciousness) which argues that it does not make sense to speak of a world outside of the mind. In any event, the point is that a model where we speak of two completely separate and independent minds passing messages between them is perhaps too simple. 

There are a large number of good books about Buddhism (and, more to the point of this site, Buddhist philosophy), but you seem to be looking for practical advice-- i.e., putting the teachings into practice-- which leads me to suggest that you visit a Buddhist center of some sort in person. Trying to learn Buddhist practice from a book is something like trying to learn to swim from a book; it may be possible, but it is far from the optimal method. Note, by the way, that there is something called "the paradox of desire"; in order to be free of desires, you must first have the desire to be free of desires. Note: if you really want book suggestions, I'll add them, but I really would recommend visiting a center first. 

No, I don't think so-- I think you've put your finger on a genuine conundrum regarding Nyāya atomism. I'm by no means an expert on Nyāya or Vaiśeṣika philosophies-- my knowledge of them comes largely from Buddhist polemics and debates with them-- but the problem that you raise is one that is in turn raised by various Indian Buddhists, so it is not a new criticism. I'm afraid I don't know the Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika response to this charge; I'd be most interested if someone more knowledgeable can provide it. 

The first thing that comes to mind is Julian Jaynes's book The Origins of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind. It's highly speculative, and not taken very seriously by mainstream psychologists or philosophers, but it is aimed squarely at the topic at hand. 

I'd argue for the latter position; I think that the Philosophy of Mathematics is pretty much orthogonal to mathematical progress, and is not likely to be of much practical value if your project is to actually do mathematics. And, in fact, one prominent view in the philosophy of mathematics-- Fictionalism is predicated on precisely that orthogonality: that one is fully able to do whatever one wants to do within mathematics without having to make any ontological commitments whatsoever regarding the status of mathematical objects. 

Yes, the quoted argument is fallacious, but not due to post hoc ergo propter hoc; rather, it is affirming the consequent. The canonical fallacy is: 

First of all: let's leave "God" out of this. The argument offers no definition of God, or why one must exist-- but that's just the least of the problems. In fact, the number of fallacies in the proposed syllogism is staggering. There is absolutely no relevant distinction that can be drawn between "words" and "numbers" in terms of this argument. The set of real numbers is an abstract set, as is the set of potential words. Neither is countable, yet humans are capable of distinguishing between any two numbers or words, and ordering them according to numerical/alphabetical sequence. And the capability of a human to do so for larger subsets is limited only by the time allotted. Not only does the proposed argument have no bearing on whether or not God exists, it actually fails to prove anything.
