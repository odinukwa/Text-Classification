Can philosophy keep pace? What I think philosophy is in crying need of is a retrospective assessment: what have we learned from our work? This undertaking would require a group of experienced philosophers to undertake the task. I do not believe that philosophy is merely about asking interesting questions. I do believe there have been "findings" in philosophy, though many times these findings are in the nature of better or worse: eg this road is a good one to pursue, this one is worse, this one is a dead end, and so on. You would think the sub-field of History of Philosophy would naturally pursue on its own such an inquiry , but as far as I know it has not done so, though it has generated much raw material for such a study. I have read an assessment of the results of analytic philosophy which I thought was pretty good, but I would have to search around in my papers to find the author. So this is one of my interests. I would mention that British philosopher Nicholas Maxwell has something called Wisdom philosophy he's been working on for some time which has some interesting points but I have only read a smattering of it. I think even practicing scientists may be interested in his: From Knowledge to Wisdom: a revolution in the aims and methods of science. (1984), B. Blackwell, pub. Should be available in the larger libraries. 

Certainly the individual was important to Marx. He wrote an essay at the age of 16, I believe, taking a position against human degradation, so I think this was a life motif for Marx, and a guiding light for him. But I think what is of utmost importance in the study of Marx, and for the study of any philosopher for that matter, is to consider the question of when did we actually get the writings that the thinker produced? Do we have them all? Have they been worked over properly? A lot of stuff was written about Marx before we even had a grip on his body of work, and much of what was written about him was either incomplete, or flat wrong. Maximilien Rubel began to undertake this process, at least for French speakers, in the 1950s I think. There is a collection of essays, Rubel on Karl Marx: 5 Essays (it is available in English, Cambridge 1981), and this collection recounts the adventures of Marx's papers, and I think one of the essays may serve to help answer your questions. We are still relatively early in the study of Marx. 

You can probably only preach to the already converted, there will probably be a certain number in attendance at your talk who are sympathetic to your message, as for the rest you will be knocking your head against the wall. How to get run out of the room? You will have to go to Freud, 1923, The Ego and the Id, "What is now holding sway in the superego is, as it were, a pure culture of the death instinct." "As is well known, in the superego there is all of human civilization with its structures, its taboos, its laws, its ideologies." Jose P. Miranda, Marx and the Bible, Orbis Books, 1974, p. 281. (The core of Miranda's book is actually Heidegger-Bultmann-Tillich, and not Marx, but there is a wrapper of Marx, so to speak, on each end of the book.). Btw, Miranda is not writing a book about the environment, but he does write some things at the end about death, and even overcoming death. We can get ourselves into a narrowly rational dynamic where we tell ourselves "it" cannot be stopped, we tell ourselves that we have lost control of the object that we ourselves created. We buy into our own Frankenstein story, because All-father, daddy, or in some way the parent (all the shoulds and musts) of our civilization told us "it", this thing, was the right way to go, even unto death. The control of the superego acts to repress the big picture, rational talk has little chance to change the person, and forcing the issue can even result in a psychological crisis. The large picture of the rational, gets lost in tomorrow's small "rational" irrational acts. So death talk, suicide talk, apocalyptic talk, nihilistic talk, starts leaking out of the system. Let's hope it that in the short term people can sustain hope, and work with the ship to turn the ship. To understand further what is going on in the superego, particularly the effects of the authoritarian "Daddy" on the child (and the grown up child), see for instance: "The Broken Rebel; a study in culture, politics, and authoritarian character."Rupert Wilkinson, Harper & Row, 1972. But you can't do any of this today, you can't mention Freud today in polite company, you'll be lucky to even find the books cited. You'll get thrown out of the room. We have to understand that some people cannot, they cannot, psychologically, face up to this problem. In our society, we can gently try to move people away from apocalyptic visions and acting out, and move them gently away from nihilism (I.e. try to prevent Thanatos from running amok in our world) , but that is all we can really do, and in the meantime work with those who agree with us that this issue is important. P.S. I am focused here on psychological issues which, if they have come into philosophy at all, came in from the Frankfurt School. But I am in no way suggesting that Marx qua Marx had the solution to our environmental problems, though some are trying mightily right now to make Marx into an environmentalist. Marx was in favor of our taking control of history, taking control of ends, our not being passive, I think it's safe to say that. In my opinion, if Marx came back today, he would first catch up on his history, then go to current events, primarily the economy. 

Here are two possible answers. First you could say that you believe in a ham sandwich and a glass of beer. I am serious. There is nothing wrong with this answer. After all, all living things need sustenance of some kind, and such sustenance (e.g. food and drink) is as necessary as any God ever was; and, as an added bonus, it is a way of testing whether your interlocutor knows their Rimbaud or not. Second possible answer: You could say you are a humanist. "Humanist beliefs stress the potential value and goodness of human beings, emphasize common human needs, and seek solely raitional ways of solving human problems." Google dictionary. So there is no divine or supernatural, the focus is on human matters. If you wanted to you could add that you don't see humankind as lord over the world, but rather you see the human species as potentially being able to live in harmony and with respect for the natural world.

"The bourgeoisie, wherever it has got the upper hand, has put an end to all feudal, patriarchal, idyllic relations. It has pitilessly torn asunder the motley feudal ties that bound man to his 'natural superiors,' and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self-interest, callous 'cash payment.' It has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervor, of chivalrous enthusiasm, of philistine sentimentalism, in the icy water of egotistical calculation. That It has resolved personal worth into exchange value, and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms, has set up that single, unconscionable freedomâ€”Free Trade. In one word, for exploitation, veiled by religious and political illusions, it has substituted naked, shameless, direct, brutal exploitation. The bourgeoisie has stripped of its halo every occupation hitherto honored and looked up to with reverent awe. It has converted the physician, the lawyer, the priest, the poet, the man of science, into its paid wage laborers. The bourgeoisie has torn away from the family its sentimental veil, and has reduced the family relation to a mere money relation." Karl Marx, The Communist Manifesto I think despite our political pluralism (which I doubt, I see more sameness than real differences) that most people are capable of understanding what Marx is saying here. 

The computer would generate light, but it would be infra-red, heat, right? Hmmm, but our working brain also gives off heat but it gives off more than just that. The nub of our human problem seems to be how does this "more" arise. How does it physically, materially arise? In other words our consciousness seems to have volition and all the other things that go along with it. Many characteristics. We still can't explain the link between our brain heat, if you will, and the "light" it gives off in the way of consciousness. With the computer I still just see heat; feel I mean, I don't own any I.R. goggles. It's thinking, at bottom, originates in code installed by us; or at least something got in there from us that the computer develops further. Now if the hardware had arms and I found it trying to slip my wallet out of my back pocket, then I might get suspicious and investigate further, especially if the computer made a derogatory remark about my D.L. photograph! I don't think the analogy works, but I've had little physics(h.s.) and less i.e. no cognitive science. P.s. I think I could have saved a lot of words and just said the "light" we each give off is just not equivalent. Not equivalent is what Searle is saying too. 

I have never seen such a string of words! Skeptic, determinist, existentialist nihilist. You may be able to survive any one of these maladies, but as a combination it is particularly deadly. This is a philosophical emergency. You are already a nihilist. Put all this in brackets to cast outside the area of being, this area label "chaos". Then you create an area of being with what is left. Being not as appearance that science generally deals with, but being you convey as human being. In other words, above mere things, you can give those things a superabundance of being. None of this is original to me but to Mircea Eliade in his "The Myth of the Eternal Return". This book really completes Being and Time as Heidegger never could do. Once being is conveyed then you can establish an eternal return, even if it's only the seasons of the year. The criticism of such eternal returns is that it can act to maintain the status quo, but if this wards off chaos it may be worth it as long as it does not get too rigid. It's hard to be skeptical of this. If you are IT you are the God, go do it, maybe some other Gods will join you. Of course if you start hearing voices or anything like that, pull back a little bit, take a break you know. 

1) Method Using fictions as a method can be helpful I think, and for this reason I would mention the book of Han Vaihinger $URL$ It is better to actually read Vaihinger's book if that is possible because the Wikipedia article is not too good. I often use my highly ideosyncratic Hegel, my very own Hegel, as a method to come to grips with the world; not as the absolute truth, but as a method. So I would probably put your comment regarding Stewart and Trait under the category of Method. 2) Time Both the play or drama and life are time limited, so the temptation to make an idol or fetish to solve our problems is very real. This would not be mere Method, but it would be Ontology. On the other hand, the full story, without the device of the Deus ex Machina, would be the repair of the world, but this takes time. More than one lifetime. Can the repair of the world ever be completed? If it were finished it would not be an idol because there would be no need of an idol, it would just be a better world. I don't know the answer to the question of whether the repair could be completed, but I feel certain that there is a lot written on this subject. It was Karl Marx I believe who specifically recognized that man is quick to solve his problems with a fetish or idol. Why? Probably because we can't resist having an ersatz answer to life's problems within our single lifespan. This was Marx's concept of reification. If Marx did not discover reification, he certainly developed it with extraordinary genius. So we know that if we think of an orange as just an orange, we have a fetish or idol. But no, the orange came from a seed, it was planted, tended by humans, nourished by nature, transported to the market again by human beings; so there is a lot of history wrapped up into "this single orange", this idol, this fetish, this ontology. Now say, for instance in the Kabbalah, is Kether ever reified? No. I don't think so, and this is very wise I think. It is hidden and resistant to man's shortcuts, ontologies and so on. To move this back into "purely" philosophical discourse, we probably come, at the end of the day, to something like Hans Gadamer, "Truth and Method", just as one example. Broadly speaking, hermeneutics, which is never finished until we are finished! But tradition as a topic is a bigger topic than hermeneutics itself. In other words, what is taught in the universities today is often a reduced hermeneutics. 

You have noticed something very important I think. The logos ("word" will do, but it is an inadequate translation) is a sign, but is it really a mere sign, or does it actually participate, actively and ontologically with/in the godhead? If it participates the words of prayer have a real power flowing back and forth from this God. There is a saying in the Roman Catholic church that the Sacraments bring about what they signify. They are more than just signs, they ontologically participate in the trinitiy's plan, now, today. They have power today through co-being. For instance, to take communion under the accidents (signs) of bread and wine is more than that, it is to participate with real being, the actual blood and body of Christ, and participating in it confers grace right now because it is in co-being with it right now. Short diversion: (This influence comes from the Greeks, not just because the church itself read the classic philosophers, but because during Jesus's time some Greek writings philosophy AND myth had filtered down, at least in a jumbled way, throughout the geographical area and this got into the New Testament itself. Note Jesus himself, and read carefully about his various associations with wine, he had men AND women followers, ate and drank wine with prostitutes, he was said to be a wine bibber. Dionysus, no? It is quite possible Jesus modeled himself at least in part on this figure: the bull and the feminine together (the bull clears the temple forecourt of the money changers). So there was certainly a part of Christianity which is not just slave-like. Jesus was meek AND strong. Of course Nietzsche had to know this instantly but he half suppressed it on purpose, I think). Now back to your questions. The key philosopher here is John of St. Thomas (John Poinsot), I think. And note that if you think about intersubjective consciousness you are speaking of a type of co-being, ontological participation with the other. More than mere words as mere signs, but a participation in being. The philosopher John Deely has lead the charge in modern scholarship on John Poinsot. 

Gyorgy Lukacs would have probably used the name vitalism, but he tended to overburden this word I think. See, "On Heidegger's Nazism & Philosophy" p. 149, by Tom Rockmore; and G. Lukacs' "Destruction of Reason". I would have never thought to mention behaviorism in a post such as yours, but I think it's brilliant. One time I tried to read B.F Skinner's "Beyond Freedom & Dignity", and as I began to read between the lines it disturbed me so much I had to stop reading it. I became very suspicious of behaviorism after getting a little dose of Skinner. 

Quine was very pragmatic about the issue. These examples come from a book by Prof. Gibson, Quine scholar. J.S. Mill said mathematics was empirical. A.J. Ayer, who was an empiricist, says the necessity of logic and mathematics is real, and necessary because analytic, but does not provide truth about the world. Quine rejects both of these men, supposedly: "The justification of logic and mathematics is on a par with the justification of theoretical physics. Logic, mathematics, physics are needed in the construction of our overall best theory of the world, and all three are justified to the extent that they make that theory come out right, .ie maximize true predictions." Prof. Roger Gibson Jr. on Quine. Huh? Circular somehow? Now to be fair to Quine, his philosophy fits within a system. A pragmatic system. He sweated over this pretty hard. (Edit: like I'm doing) It hangs together as a system, and it would require me to set out his entire pragmatic system to make Quine's statement above make sense. EDIT. After reading what Not-here wrote above, I think Gibson might have skipped over a point. It seems that Quine accepted Ayer-like position (analytic) essentially, but Ayer (and Ayer is not the only one) said such mathematical reasoning does not provide truth about the the world, therefore the use of math and logic and theoretical physics would need a justification if used to advance our overall theory of the world, and all three are justified to the extent they make our theory of the world come out right, that is to say, that they maximize true predictions. (The paragraph above is still not right because it does not state what not-here was referring to, and the question appears to have already been answered, which is a good thing because I am certainly not making any progress with Quine's thought.) Einstein's position and the position of Ayer seem to be closer to what mainstream philosophy has to say today. But I'm not up to date on it. Quine's position is subtle and pragmatic, but will not satisfy the mathematicians. None of the three philosophers mentioned is probably able to satisfy a mathematician. All of this is apt to drive the mathematicians insane. This lack of clarity and the looseness of it is because we are still confused about just exactly what mathematics is. We may never figure it out. Do what the mathematicians do and forget about it. Keep doing mathematics. Sure you can do proofs. Just follow the rules of the game. Deduction. These truths were never true in the real sense of the world (see Ayer). However, oddly, strangely sometimes when math touches the world it seems to be a match made in heaven! When this happens, mine it for all it's worth. See SEP on Quine as not-here suggests. You can also read about philosophy of math in MacMillan Encl Phil. 10 vols
