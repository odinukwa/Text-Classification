Please note that one doesn't need to swallow the whole verificationist framework in order to find this analysis pertinent for the question at hand. The distinction between metaphysical and mythological meaning isn't necessarily based on any strict verificationist assumption. We can certainly enlarge our understanding of empirical existence to include theoretical concepts (electrons, strings) and social facts (the existence of five dollar bills, being married to someone). We can even enlarge our understanding of existence to the non empirical domain to include fantastical concepts (unicorns, etc.), such that e.g. in "some sense" we can say true things about Sherlock Holmes. I'd think that Dawkins & Co. attack the "empirical" viz. "mythological" meaning of God and the question of its existence and in that respect negative claims of the kind "God (most probably) doesn't exist" or "I don't believe in the existence of God" make sense. Arguing that this kind of "empirical meaning" of God is nowhere implied in the theological discussion today seems to me to miss the mark. For it is certainly not the case that "the whole thing is based on faith" as you say: The existence of God is supported by references to any kind of phenomenological effects in the domain of human experience. Or, to take the semantic spin: They submit that sentences about God are truth-apt. Now, the proponent in these discussions can always retreat to a "metaphysical" (in the above parlance) understanding of God, but in doing so the whole concept looses much of its punch and relevance. And I would submit that Dawkin & Co. have no particular problem with this metaphysical understanding of God, that's not the target they are after. 

A lot of different forms of suicides were and are, depending on the culture, socially accepted. E.g. the hero's death: Killing in order to help someone or something else is often considered, be it family member or a nation, to be an honorable act. Though as killing oneself is not the main goal, it is a special case. More to the point would be soldiers and secret agents, who carry around suicide pills in order to avoid a more painful death and not to leak essential information, or even suicide attackers. Also, in some Asian cultures, ritual suicides served as a form to restore one's or the family's honor after failing an important task or committing a terrible offense, e.g. Seppuku. Those forms have one thing in common: They are not only committed for oneself but for others. What you are describing is a person who wants to die because they want to die never minding the consequences. So one could boil your question down to: Is it OK to commit suicide for selfish reasons? Does the person really have to care what others around them think and what consequences they have to endure due to it? You may cause your parents and family sorrow, or your children may be orphaned, yet where does the obligation derive from to not cause them such harm? I for one would allow for such selfish suicide. All I would ask was that the person in question would seek help in order to determine if the person has made up their mind in a sound way. The choice to kill yourself is quite final by definition, so it should be done with extra care. Many people who undergo a suicidal phase feel that their problems are unsolvable, even though they appear quite insignificant from an outsider's perspective, and very much can be solved. So I would argue that we at least try to help those who want to commit suicide to understand themselves why they want to do it. Yet there is no necessity to stop people from committing suicide, and keeping people alive against their will seems unethical to me, simply due to the fact that I can think of situations where I would want to die yet could not kill myself. (Just watch Johnny got his gun.) People are not asked to be born, yet they can control how they die. So for me, I will handle it in this way: "As long as I want to live, I keep on living. If I do not want to live anymore, I will seek help in order to analyse my unhappiness and if it can be resolved. If I understand my reasons and my unhappiness cannot be resolved I will commit suicide", and I recommend the same procedure to others who feel suicidal as well. 

First, it's good to have actual scientists (in training) asking questions on SE.Philosophy! Does falsificationism apply to scientific practice? You seem to be bothered by the observation that the scientific practice in your field doesn't conform to Popperian ideals of falsification(ism). Well, the good news is that no scientific practice conforms to Popper's ideals, so you're not alone. Indeed, Popper's theory has no pretence to describe scientific practice, it is a normative theory, its aim (at least starting with Logic of scientific discovery of 1934) is to postulate ideal methodological rules. So 

Feyerabend's point is exactly that an answer to this question cannot be given by experts (including philosophers and scientists), but has to be the outcome of democratic deliberation. Thus he explicitly refuses to give an answer qua philosopher. "Financial profit", "social considerations", "aesthetic values" are all on the table. It is up to democratic decision-making involving society to weight and set up "principles". Feyerabend's more in-depth political considerations are contained in his book Science in a Free Society (1978). There he explains the concepts of democratic relativism and free society in more detail. The book contains an illuminating analogy to exemplify his proposal of a free society and the role of experts therein: the system of courts of law in which citizens are judged by a jury of peers. While experts may be called to testify, they do not necessarily have an exceptional standing and are one factor among many leading to the final verdict, which is deliberated and agreed upon by a group of citizens. In a sense, this is more than an analogy. Feyerabend points out that we already have a system in place which doesn't simply follow evidential rules, but weighs evidential criteria against others and trusts non-experts to do this in literally life-or-death situations. He urges us to extend this model: citizens should have the final say in social-political decision-making. 

Living beings that can let ideas die instead of themselves had better survival chances. If you are standing in front of a cliff and think about what would happen to your body you might come to the conclusion that it would be unwise to jump if you valued your life. Furthermore, if we assume that there is a universe and that the brain is part of the universe, then your mind also is part of the universe as it is the brain-in-process. So while the simulation of you jumping of the bridge only exists in your mind, there is a physical process taking place in your brain while you are doing it. And while you find it strange that we can conceptualize imaginary things, I would like to point out that our mind is not perfect suited in conceptualizing possible things. I actually built myself a mobius strip and used my fingers to convince myself that a three dimensional shape with only one edge and one area was possible. And once we enter the realms of quantum physics, we can only realize how very limited our brain is suited to grasp the real universe. 

I find myself not agreeing with any of those possibilities by themselves, yet agreeing on some on some levels. I think there is no such thing as malevolent intent for a drone, so every damage would be an accident. I hence doubt we could treat such a drone like a human and have it put on trial. An accident then could either be caused by a force majeure, e.g. due to a natural disaster, or be boiled down to technical failure. For technical failure, it would be either the the company's fault for not testing the device enough or the developer's one for making a mistake. The severity would then be determined if it was a somewhat understandable oversight or a grossly negligent act. I think the real question hiding in there is: What kind of security standard do we want to apply as a society on such devices without hindering innovation too much? Or don't we want them at all? If a company or a developer must fear high compensation for damages, wouldn't the rational choice be not to build such drones? 

1. Yes, it is logically possible that there is no consistent formal system that can serve as a foundation for mathematics. This follows immediately from Gödel's second Incompleteness theorem, which proves that that no consistent axiomatic system which includes Peano arithmetic (or stronger) can prove its own consistency. Assuming that any such foundational theory T is such an effectively generated formal system, i.e an axiomatic theory expressive enough to develop basic properties of the natural numbers, T cannot prove its own consistency. Thus is it logically possible that it is inconsistent. 2. No, it is highly unlikely that there are no consistent foundations for mathematics. This would mean that every conceivable candidate is inconsistent. But this is not what our mathematical practice tells us. The assumption that de facto candidates for such a foundational theory of mathematics (ZFC plus some other axioms) are consistent is not a simple convention. Logicians apply ampliative reasoning usually found in the science and think they have some good measure of inductive support to believe that they these candidates are consistent: they have been working with ZFC for almost a century and have never encountered an inconsistency. (Cf. this with the discovery of the inconsistency of Frege's system, which was discovered by Russell while Frege's publication was still in press.) 

The logical positivists hardly subscribed to verificationism, but your question is about verificationism, not about logical positivists, so that's a minor quibble. 

No, there is no must per se. There is only a should in order to ensure an outcome, and as you stated, your intent is to retain the capacity of self-legislation. Another question that is hiding in yours is, "Must any freedom be guaranteed?". If so, where does the necessity derive from? And how are conflicts of certain freedoms be solved, e.g. when people use free speech to agitate or spread lies? In the end, it's about values and how those values are prioritized. In Germany for example human dignity takes precedence over freedom of speech and therefore among other reasons Holocaust denial is considered a crime. A constitution reflects values of a society at the time when it was written. It does not ensure that those values remain the same over time. And there may be a time when people will value other things more than freedom of speech and maybe they even want to give up the capacity of self-legislation. You cannot stop that. And then a constitution will be changed. And even if the people would still value those things, you cannot ensure that a political system will remain in place with the help of a text. A powerful minority may use loopholes or start a revolution and proclaim their own set of rules. 

One of those thing will be true so the statement is always true. Yet is says nothing about the actual ability. Trivial sentences say nothing. So as a different approach, let us look at the term believe. It is often used to convey an assumption. So the statement might as well be: 

A nice thought-experiment is to try to imagine what will be passed on from 20th century philosophy in, say, 200 years from now. Inevitably one will come up with a list of people popular and seen as "on the right track" today. If history can give us any guidance, the criteria for the inevitable selection process will be established by what will be deemed interesting in 200 years, most certainly not what has been popular and deemed "the right direction" in the 20th century. 

1 Not in the sense that scientific theories are expressed in the language of mathematics, which is (mostly) thought to be analytic. 

With all the usual disclaimers about postmodernism in place (i.e. not being a single approach, including a variety of contrasting ideas, etc.)… The "culprit" here is the wide reception of French literary critic Roland Barthes and his essay The Death of the Author from 1967. Taking cue from similar ideas by earlier writers, the essay questions the role that authorial intent can play in the interpretation of texts. Barthes' argues for his proposition in a variety of ways: 

For the very simple reason that they have been passed on by subsequent thinkers, while all others have not. It might not seem to you like a satisfactory answer, but the following question why have certain people's ideas been passed on and others not? has no unique answer, and explanations are as varied as historical explanations can get: All manuscripts but a few burned in a certain place. A certain religious background allowed some ideas to thrive and others where lost into oblivion. A new science becomes successful and some obscure ideas on which the scientific endeavor is based suddenly become common sense. Not to mention the creation of "classics" out of thin air by backdating later ideas to previous thinkers to forge arguments from authority. In this sense it can be said that what makes up the canon are no "personal philosophies", but highly adapted ideas to a certain point in time. Also, your question implies that what makes up a philosophical canon simply accumulates over time. The most important lesson here, I think, is that there is no such static mainstream, an overarching canon. "Classics" change from century to century. I don't think most have ever heard of Eugen Rosenstock-Huessy or Hugo Dingler, an opportunistic Nazi-philosopher? During their time they were very popular (and sometime influential), today they are forgotten and will likely not survive another century. Yet, e.g. Dingler's weird concept of science survived in the work of his pupil Paul Lorenzen and got us the "Erlangen program", a rejection of relativity theory and the creation of game semantics. (You can guess which outcomes have become popular and which have not.) Doing research in the history of philosophy can be a daunting task at times for exactly this reason: e.g. you might want to understand certain nowadays "classics" in their own time and place and discover - not without puzzlement - that you have to acquaint yourself with obscure figures and ideas in order to proceed any further. Sometimes these figures were much more popular during their time than today's "classics". 

Philosophy of science is the science about science, or to put it differently the theory of science. It is a meta-science which determines which endeavors are scientific in the first place and not merely pseudoscience. So basically, it asks what science is. What do we have to assume to conduct science? Can we know anything (for sure) and, if so, what can we know? What rules one should apply in science? Which standard should we adhere to, strict or pragmatic? Is there such a thing as scientific progress? Are there different fields which require a different methodology, e.g.: Can we conduct "physics" in the same way we conduct "sociology"? Can science influence our sense of morality? Can it affect ethics or is that something else entirely? It is a very broad field, and for me philosophy of science is quite frankly the king of all sciences. 

Human reasoning evolved as a tool to ensure our survival on this planet. If a monkey miscalculated the distance of the next tree branch, he would be a dead monkey. This means, that our brain has to create a somewhat consistent model of the world, yet by no means was there evolutionary pressure to think logically in a strict formal sense. A lot of illogical fallacies are in fact encoded into our way thinking. Humans, for example, tend to think that if one object of a certain kind has a specific property, that all objects of those kind will have it. That may be okay if we want to eat apples, and conclude that because one is not poisonous that all are not poisonous. Yet it may hinder us on social scale if we start to generalize population of other nations this way because of wrong perception of a few individuals. This encoded way of thinking can be called our "common sense", which remains a useful tool, yet also a pretty dangerous one. Or as Albert Einstein said: 

Have a look at the activities of the Munich Center for Mathematical Philosophy. Their work is really impressive. 

First, let's settle the terminology: Physicalism and idealism are in many respects opposite positions in philosophy of mind. But that doesn't entail that every non-physicalist position is a form of idealism. That is, there are a lot of non-physicalist positions that do not amount to idealism. Among these positions, the following were prominently defended and discussed in the 20th century: interactionist dualism, parallelism, epiphenomenalism, neutral monism. Now, idealism is indeed not on that list. Still, there is recent work done by Robert Adams, who defends a sort of idealism ("mentalism") in phil. of mind, according to which 

That is, Heidegger claims that there is an essential connection between things (concepts?) and word signs in the Greek language (that other languages lack). Note that he speaks of "audible Greek word", i.e. he includes sounds. The Greek language is transparent, the language itself shows its meaning somehow... This clearly goes against the intuition that language and linguistic meaning are just glued together by convention. As Shakespeare famously put it: 

A lot of hypotheses which are scientific in the sense of (1) are not therefore part of (2). Consider the hypothesis H that the earth was created approx. 6,000 years ago. It is certainly scientific in the sense of (1), but it is not scientific in the sense of (2). "Well", you might say, "that's because H is false!" And you would be correct. But that's not the only reason why hypotheses in (1) are not therefore part of (2). Consider the hypothesis-schema that all persons born under X are less likely to display Y than persons born under Z (H2, where X, Z are astrological signs and Y is a behaviour). Again, H2 is certainly scientific in the sense of (1), but it is not scientific in the sense of (2). But this time not because we have established that H2 is false (arguably nobody took the effort to test it), but because it lacks contact, as it were, with the body of actual scientific theories (which, incidentally, is the reason why nobody tested it). I submit that the hypothesis "every object was created" in your example is of the H2-kind. And that brings me to the difference between (1) and (2). In the context of (1) we can speak of single hypotheses, e.g. empirical generalizations, as being "scientific" somewhat in isolation. But in the context of (2), hypotheses don't exist in isolation, they are scientific in virtue of being part of theories, larger structures connecting many hypotheses with observations, laws, initial conditions and other things. In this sense your "objection 2" is crucial: "Created is vague. Define Created." Here the request should not be aiming to get a clear definition of "created", but for the other party to introduce and explain the 'theoretical pedigree', as it were, of the particular hypothesis, i.e. in what theory the hypothesis is embedded and how. (I would say that this actually gives you the meaning of "created", but this is a matter of dispute.) Concluding, your uneasiness with "every object was created" is justified insofar as the the hypothesis lacks a theoretical framework in science, i.e. it is not scientific in the sense of (2). Your confusion stems from the - equally right - observation that it is scientific in the sense of (1). Keep in mind, however, that it would be unwise to require a definition that excludes a priori the hypothesis "every object was created" for there's no principled reason why it couldn't be assimilated in a scientific theory in the future. Search for a definition that prevents a priori the hypothesis from being a part of science and you overstep your aim unnecessarily. Do not confuse the actual lack of a theoretical framework in science with a principled impossibility of such an embedding. The former suffices to justify your uneasiness.
