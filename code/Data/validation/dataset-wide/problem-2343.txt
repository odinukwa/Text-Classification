Use a non-battery welding mask glass. You can carry it in the same pouch as your magnifying glass. One can be Purchased new for a couple of dollars. They can also be had second hand. 

First it is not illegal to feed and hunt in all areas, only some. Google "deer feeder" there are industries around this market. I discuss some of the considerations in my answer at What are the downsides of baiting game while hunting? Where food is grown, grown food plots are always present, all animals including game animals come and go to these plots as they desire. It just in not practical to say you can't hunt in the crop fields of the US grain belt. Additionally it takes substantial work outside of the hunting season to maintain this plot of land. If a hunter grabs a bag of apples at the store, and drops them in a field, the food is only there by the direct intervention of the hunter. True he probably does it more than once, but the point is that is unnatural. The food surplus (what the animal eats), is greater than the environment can support. The real short answer is: Where baiting is illegal, the law makers believe it will increase the harvest rate (killing) of target species above what the ecosystem can sustain. There are environmental, political and economic reasons that make the extermination of game animals in some areas undesirable. Hunting laws are generally designed to maintain stable population and harvest rates. 

There is a recent question What material is a good alternative to neoprene? one of the comments to an answer says: 

I would imagine the key to survival is how much the stringer impacts the gills ability to uptake oxygen. This question is limited to fresh water fishing, using a stringer in salt water is likely to get your catch eaten. Assuming the fish was not significantly harmed when caught, how long can it live on a stringer? 

Neither, typically seen with small sails and or low budget rigs going down wind only. Outrigger only, typically seen on canoes with and without sails. Leeboard only, typically seen on mid-range to high performance rigs. Outrigger and leeboard, occasionally seen in all ranges. Seems to be the least photographed and posted option. 

Given the available information. You can make a bear resistant pannier, as you would any other pannier, use Spectra fabric and Spectra thread. Sewing would also require an industrial grade machine, capable working with the Spectra fabric and thread. I would suggest contacting the Ursak Company to custom make your pannier as probably the most cost effective solution. 

After considering the pros and cons of several solutions and desiring a solution with a life span of years, with low cost and easy to reuse, I created my own screen covers. Materials 

I am not an expert, but this caught my attention. The image appears to be of a common green darner(Anax junius) which is one of 16 North American dragonflies known to migrate Dragon flies are known to migrate along mountain ridges, which Google Maps indicates the location is. Being cold blooded they warm themselves by basking in the sun 

For type 2 diabetics some of the new inhaled insulin products like Afrezza seem to be more forgiving of temperature fluctuations. These appear to only be the fast acting insulin's so not a big help for the type 1 who also needs long acting insulin. There are no products that I am aware designed specifically to keep something just above freezing without going over 70 (or lower degrees). I travel with a type 1 diabetic, and I have spent several years living off grid, I am not a Doctor, and the following are just suggestions, you will want to run any potential solution past your medical provider. Your first point is keeping a 90 day supply at refrigerator temp. As we know a 90 day supply through many insurance programs is cheaper. A 30 day supply or 28 day according to this source can stay at room temperature. So changing your refill quantity could make things easier, allowing for a larger range of temperatures. If you are totally off grid but able to maintain a room above freezing products like the frio can really help with temperature stabilization. We own several of them in different sizes, and they have really helped us be more mobile. Keeping dependable refrigerator temps off grid, is really hard. There are 12 volt and propane refrigerators, but in my experience, the temperature control is not fine enough to risk insulin in. A couple of ice particles in your beverage is fine, but in your insulin, could mean your death. If your going to use a refrigerator to cool insulin in a warm room, I strongly suggest only using a 110 volt unit (not a dual or three way model, a 110 only household model). Which means a very expensive off grid power supply, that provides juice 24/7. Keeping a room warm is not difficult, if you are there. But the most cost effective solutions are wood and Kerosene, for the very budget aware solutions these are going to need attention every 8 to 12 hours at the outside. If you are gone for 24 hours, during an arctic winter day/night the risk of indoor freezing temps is very high. If you need to keep heat going while you are gone for say a 72 hour round trip into town to pick up meds and supplies, and you are totally off grid, a propane heating system is probably the most cost effective solution. Our newer camp trailer has a thermostat controlled propane heater, that uses a 12 volt power supply. How much battery and propane you need depends on the size area you are heating and how much insulation you have. My off grid time was in Washington state, and I found a 100 pound (25 gallon) propane tank was large enough to last several days, even with the heaviest usage, and small enough that I could move it reasonably well. In summary; If I was going off grid, arctic winter, with type 1 diabetic supplies. I would get insulin refills every 30 days, use a frio to keep the temperature stable (also helps keep the chill off for short periods). I would use a thermostatic controlled propane heater with a 12 volt fan. I would have at least two 25 gallon propane tanks, and head into town for more propane no later then the day I connected the last tank (sooner is ok, but make sure you have a full tank connected the day you leave). There are a lot of variables on 12 volt usage, so you will need to figure out how many deep cycle batteries you will need to keep the house going for 3 days. Keep in mind, a snow covered solar panel on a cloudy day is not going to provide any energy. Additional Comment Currently we travel with a camp trailer, that has a 110 and propane power options. We never put insulin it! We do use it to freeze, freezer packs, which we then use to keep the insulin (and other meds) cool in a small cooler. 

On browsing the web, everyone seems to think their choice is the best, so I am having difficulty assessing the pro and cons of each choice. What should I consider when designing my canoe sailing solution as it relates to outriggers and leeboards? My current plans are limited to inland water ways (rivers) but you never know where the next adventure will take you so, considerations for all types of water would be appreciated.

Cleaning the fire pit is a task I generally do on arrival. As mentioned in the question and existing answer, hot ashes can start forest fires. A full fire pit will contain 2 or 3 things. 

I am planning a homebuilt sailing craft that uses a sail similar to the Sunfish (image below) I have seen a few homebuilt sails that use metal electrical conduit for the mast and spars, and am working on a similar design for myself. In the sunfish a Gooseneck is used to connect the boom to the mast. $84 seems a bit much for one peice of a homebuilt sailing rig. I had contemplated a Forged Swivel at $13 it seems more cost effective, and looks to be at least as strong. (Working load weight 3600 lbs for the 1/2 model) but would probably need to be connected to the mast and boom with rope or "C" clamps. What is a good solution for the low budget homebuilt sailboat maker? 

From reading the question, I suspect the OP understands "sealing" to be the verb described by the description "apply a nonporous coating to (a surface) to make it impervious.". When they talk about sealing a pelt they are using it as the action to acquire the noun described by the description "a piece of wax, lead, or other material with an individual design stamped into it, attached to a document to show that it has come from the person who claims to have issued it." The tag or seal is applied to the pelt to identify it's origin, and show it has been harvested in accordance with the law. 

Install the screened port cover, silicon side down. Use the binder clip to hold tension on the rope. 

As Rory states in his answer, hull weight is just the hull. But you need not worry, the mast, rudder, center board, sail, etc. Are usually loaded separately from the hull of the boat. For small two person sail boats, around 100 pound. All the parts except for a couple pieces of hardware come off.

Short term survival is the goal, living long enough to die of cancer in 10 years because there was a carcinogen in something, is not a bad option. We have an existing post Finding water in the dry wilderness but it does not address the several gallons of fluids that might be available in your automobile. This question is specific to automotive fluids. 

I was reading the BBC news today and there was an ad for an inexpensive "5 in 1 Outdoor Survival Gear Escape Paracord Bracelet Flint / Whistle / Compass / Scraper" I clicked on the link and saw this photo, four compasses sitting side by side. Two of them agree, the other two disagree significantly about the direction. How accurate/dependable should you expect an inexpensive compass to be? 

I want to be able to take a blind passenger on a canoe trip to enjoy the sounds of nature. The closest I have found are organized journeys into restricted lands, where a large group (of sighted, talkative people) join you on the journey. Edit Clarify per request in comments Rivers don't work well, as the areas without current tend to have a high motorboat population. (fails criteria 1 & 4) There are a few man made lakes in the area, the ones I have looked at to date are planted with fish, so there is a high population of people fishing, this negatively impacts the wildlife around the lake. (multiple options that meet criteria 1-4, but no significant wildlife) I have been looking at wildlife refuges on the shores of the great lakes, but the few I have checked have highly restricted access (fails criteria 2 & 3) the only option is to guided tour with lots of noisy people. I have seen some areas that meet all of criteria but, the tend to be in natural marshes and swamps, Washington, Florida, etc with large wetland preserves and/or tidal lands. Note I have my own watercraft. I don't need a rental boat, I just need to be able to access the water with my canoe and a handicapped passenger.
