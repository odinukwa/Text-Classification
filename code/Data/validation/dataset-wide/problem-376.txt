Hitler opens Mein Kampf with a warning that exactly what he was going to do is what happens when the general population takes no interest in politics. He himself entered politics because he views that the more the general populace ignores politics, the more totalitarian the regime can be. If I may get up on a soapbox, I dare say that his rally to get the general populace interested in politics is the reason for the banning of Mein Kampf. There is actually very little antisemitism in that book. 

The immortal may become an "Adam" or "Genghis Khan" in the sense that he may sire a large portion of the population. Adam is recognised by the Abrahamic faiths as the father of all men. Genghis had 500-1000 direct offspring by most accounts. This immortal being, by fathering one child every ten years, will have by the time that the story takes place fathered as many children as Genghis Khan. Those children will have many children as well. Being spread out across the centuries, the immortal being will likely be an ancestor of almost all living beings. 

While one of the most highly upvoted comments states that swords aren't used for hunting, they are incorrect. Swords & knives are used for killing prey that has been trapped and is either so badly wounded / poisioned it is unable to fight back, or constrained to the degree that it is unable to fight back. Thus a good reason to attack a dragon with a sword or other melee weapon is that it is now safe to get that close; and one does not have a ranged weapon on you, or have the requirement to preserve ammunition. One might ask how the trap might be prepared to capture or poision the dragon, but this is somewhat out of scope of the question since one could use mechanical traps (eg nets / falling objects etc), poision darts or any other means; and the question isn't how to trap, but why would one be forced to use melee. 

I've been debating about animal testing with someone who's adamant it's a moral flaw of humanity on the level of, and directly leading to, genocide. While the discussion itself has warped into a moral shaming fight, it has gotten me thinking: What would the world be like if animal testing had never existed? I've looked into the matter, but all I've found is explanations of why animal testing can't be stopped now, or what recent advances it's allowed; what I'm actually looking for is this: 

Thanks for all the answers so far, though. I'll refrain from accepting an answer yet; the situation I'm working with is a lot more specific than my original question stated, and I don't want to accept an answer that fits my scenario over a better answer that's slightly too far from what I'm doing (but might work for others). 

During medieval England, there was a requirement for every man and boy to practice archery - should a war with France requrire additional soldiers. $URL$ The law stated that all boys from 7 to 17 would be provided a bow and arrows by the parents (to practice) and from 17 the boy would be required to provide his own (to fight). Training was required every week; and playing other games was forbidden. Assuming an even distribution of ages in the village, aged 0 - 60; and an age of 20-60 able to fight; this leaves 2/3 of the male population that can be called upon - leading to 2/3 * 1/2 * 25,000 ~ 8,300 men. Note that these will be just the archers that can be called upon, and more expensive soldiers with armour or horses will be significantly less. This also ignores any sort of morale impact - as calling every male from a village is likely to have a negative impact on the rulers ability to control said village. 

In one of the stories I'm writing, I have a character that falls from our world into another, far less advanced one, and brings his smartphone with him (along with a few other things, but they aren't important). Now, due to a magical artifact he finds in the region he ends up in, his smartphone is constantly charged, and has an internet connection through which he can view a static image of everything available on the internet at the time he left (no posting on forums or watching livestreams, but reading old blog posts/info sites/SE questions and watching videos that aren't live still works). Now, the battery I can explain away fairly easily with magic involved, but the DNS system and others that make up internet connections aren't as simple (there's a reason it's called a net, after all). I could just say, "It's magic," and leave it at that, but I'm not the kind of writer to toss out internal consistency; and, frankly, the restrictions inherent in a logical explanation will most likely make for interesting plot points. So, without unduly stretching suspension of disbelief, what is the most logical way that magic could get around the handshaking and delays inherent in the internet system, and provide a static representation of the internet at a single point in time that is otherwise indistinguishable from how our internet appears here? EDIT Section! Yay! There are a few things I need to clarify here, so I'll make a list: 

In addition to the charing on the outside, mentioned in the other answers, the inside of the station will burn depending on how hot and for how long. Although the outside of the station may be the other side of the wood and where the heat is applied, the energy will still be transfered, and may reasonably ignite as it hass access to oxygen.* Alternatively, one could fire an oxidizing agent - for example nitric acid, at the hull, and it will burn perfectly well on the outside. *Until a hull breach or vent at which point the inside will no longer have oxygen to burn with 

Al is a rat. He is also an engineer of quite a high caliber. He has developed a suit of power armor, with a movement-assisting exoskeleton that greatly increases his strength, speed, and endurance. Now, the physical ramifications of such a suit on a human have been explored before, but what I want to know is, how does the square/cube law affect the suit? What are the ramifications, and potential applications, of such a suit for a creature much smaller than a human? For instance, with slight modifications to the foot width, and a decent speed boost, could the suit allow Al to run on water? How much less of the suit's structure would have to be put into impact shielding, if Al as a rat is naturally more resistant to impact damage than humans? 

This would mean that to bread humans for meat, one would ultimately bin the idea of feeding them animal products, (other than waste) in the same way we feed chickens which would actually happily eat anything on the floor they can scavange. If one is attempting to do this secretly, the first step would be to try and make everyone a vegetarian, or pick a location where they are already. The other requirement would be a location where life is cheap. The cheaper the life, and the more common death to various illnesses or abuse, then the more likely you'll be able to get away with it. Also these populations are more likely to have a high birth rate; essential to your high output. Putting these requirements together, I'd consider India as a likely candidate; performing 200 abductions / day in the poor regions is probably going to be largely unnoticed, and at the very least unrecorded.
