I just read an article in Scientific American: "The Strangest Numbers in String Theory" by John C. Baez and John Huerta, where they state: 

I don't have access to that journal, so I don't know how definitive it is. I have been looking for other studies and data that will either align or contradict this particular report, however, most of the data doesn't look as much at the relationships of the children of divorced parents as opposed to the general mental well being of these children. (Or something like this paper.) In that regard, it does seem that in general, children of divorced parents do show some resilience. The first paper may indicate or is searching for a genetic link in the divorce behaviour. This may over ride rational attempts to be "more likely to be careful when getting married" as you posited. 

The main reason that you should not use table salt is because the .1% that isn't NaCl is usually some sort of drying agent to keep the salt from clumping and caking. Furthermore, table salts tend to clog up when wet. Additionally, the size and shape of the salt crystals will play into how the water softener works. Table salt is generally very fine, and comes in much more regularly shaped crystals, whereas the type of salts used in water softeners are sized and shaped so as not to clump and stick together when wet. By using table salts, there appears to be some customers that have broken their dishwashers. Now, I see you mention that it is a "community" washer in the comments. This may have a different effect on what type of salt is used. Generally, industrial strength washers may have upgraded components to handle "abuse" but numerous users. it may be that your community's washer has an extra powerful pump or something to deal with the anticipated abuses. It's impossible to tell without knowing the make and model though. Hope that helps. 

I don't think the viruses responsible for the common cold can hide in the bone, though CMV can hide in the bone marrow. You mentioned rhinoviruses, and these infect epithelial cells. As to the question as to whether some of the viruses responsible for the common cold can hide, and then emerge to reinfect people, then the evidence seems to be yes where adenovirus persists inside lymphoid tissue eg tonsils.[1]

It would be logical to assume that further entry criteria were that they shared similar diagnostic criteria, and the countries were stable enough to support such a long term study. It is absurd for Taubes to write that Keys 7 countries study was invalid as he was somehow able to predict the results 29 years in advance, and that each population would show the same relationship of diet with heart disease both between countries and also inside each study population. (Keys published in 1986 on this study [4]) 

Again, with all this, you will notice statistical fluctuations. The best way to describe these would almost be to say they are weather. Weather is not climate. As shortlived humans, we have a difficult time remembering or projecting more than a few months in advance of our present time on a personal basis. Hence why weather changes seem so prevalent to us, even though they may only span a series of a few years. The overall trend is still very much upward. 

I would be highly skeptical of this claim. The mechanism that this is supposed to work by is as some sort of antibacterial agent. Although, the mild acid in vinegar really is nothing compared to the acids that are already in your stomach. The main reason that vinegar is associated as a food poisoning remedy could be because vinegar is often used as a method of preserving food for longer periods (i.e. pickling). Or as is mentioned at the Washington State University site 

There is a comprehensive review of the literature regarding the best time to introduce solids to infants. 

There are no published trials of raw food diets in the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2DM). The best we have are trials using vegan diets where there is some evidence of efficacy in promoting weight loss, lowering cholesterol levels and HbA1c levels. This 74 week trial by Neal Barnard et al showed that vegan diet was superior to the traditional diabetes diet [2]

Yes, there is a difference [1], and the longer the cattle are finished with grain, the greater the differences appears to be [2]

Ask Pat Tillman. There is an entire Military Association of Atheists and Freethinkers too. And then there is me (although I wasn't ever in a foxhole, I did my combat from 30,000 feet). The saying comes from a misconception or personal projection that great stress will cause people to retreat to something comfortable. I can personally state that in combat situations, any "thought of deities" would have resulted in me dying as opposed to actually doing the job at hand. Austin Cline who writes numerous essays on this at about.com says a few things about this 

I am quite surprised that the lecturer would make such a blatantly wrong statement. Bonobos have their own domain that even states: 

To further put this insane conspiracy to rest, keep in mind that whenever a nation buys sophisticated equipment, they perform operational tests on it. Any inherent flaws would be quickly discovered in a thorough test program. And many of the scientists, engineers, and military officers of these nations are taught and trained in the US, so they are not exactly what you would call incompetent. 

The question above is a little confused mixing claims about Ancel Keys' 7 countries study which he organised, and his 6 (22) countries study. These studies are commonly confused. The 6 (22) countries study was one he authored himself and presented in 1953 at a symposium at Mt. Sinai Hospital, New York City. Some of the work came from field work done in Europe 1951-1952 when he was a Senior Fullbright Fellow headquartered at Magdalen College, Oxford, and other data came from research grants from the National Heart Institute, and the National Dairy Council, Chicago. In the paper he describes his methods and he discusses the validity of death certification. He excludes 

So, modifying the extra-cellular pH around tumors, and also tumor cells intracellular pH are lines of active enquiry in treating cancer at this time.

The full article does a good job of talking about the reasons for embryonic research versus adult stem cell research. SUPPLEMENTAL INFO: (This is not so much a response to the question, but rather more information as to why it is important to continue embryonic stem cell research. The reason this is included is that generally the claim in the question is made because they wish to discontinue said research.) The University of Michigan also talks about why it is necessary to do embryonic research: 

What we observe as a "race" is really just a population variance amongst a localized group adapted to the environment they live in. Specific selection pressures would lead to fair skinned individuals surviving better in the north, and then later that becoming a consciously selected sexual preference. Overall, I this article in Nature may have some more answers for you: 

So, why do they give up after about 30 seconds? No one is sure as of yet (according to my single source still): 

However, the authors conclude that surgery is not cost-effective way of treatment, and most cases are actually preventable. Note also that corneal transplant requires the use of eye banks, and other sophisticated medico-surgical infrastructure. 

There seems to be a little confusion in the original statements quoted from the Mirror. First they say they use sheep placental tissue, and then they say they use amniotic fluid derived stem cells. The latter is taken from the sheep uterus under ultrasound guided aspiration. As to the efficacy of these treatments, I guess once we see wool growing over Victoria Beckham's eyes, we will know it worked. In the meantime, the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (ASAPS) and the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) released a position statement on the use of stem cells ( from humans I would imagine ) in aesthetic surgery: 

The cause of diabetes appears to be a combination of a high fat diet in conjunction with reduced exercise. Populations that have had historically high carbohydrate intake have not been prone to diabetes so this theory of a high white rice diet is likely incorrect without other factors being present. The prevalence of diabetes in China in 1980 was estimated at < 1%, 2.5% in 1994, 5.5% in 2001, and 11.6% in 2013 [0] illustrating how dietary changes have impacted on disease prevalence. If we look at animal studies where rats are fed high fat diets, we see:[1] 

Inserting your finger into any foam will disrupt the bubbles and cause them to come into contact with a separate surface than just the surrounding bubbles. This agitation serves to break bubbles. The addition of oils actually has a basis in fact because of the chemical nature of beer bubbles. This webpage explains 

ScienceDaily has a nice article on this, as well as many related articles. In the cited article, they state: 

Orange zest itself is not poisonous. The rind has a lot of citrus oils in it, and intensifies the orange flavour a great deal. Hence, many recipes call for orange zest as an ingredient. As a matter of fact, it is a primary ingredient in orange marmalade. The white part of an orange peel (the pith) is very bitter, but not poisonous. If you are going to use an orange to make some sort of zest, a very thorough washing and scrubbing would be in order. The Independent of the UK had an article talking about the rinds of oranges having a great deal of pesticide on them. And this would stand to reason since generally the rind is thrown away when most people consume oranges. 

Although methotrexate has been used for years now to treat psoriatic arthritis (PsA) with the impression of good effectiveness in both treating physicians, and patients, there has been scant proof of such effectiveness. The latest and most comprehensive data we have is from the 2012 MIPA trial [1]

This interest may have been sparked by a 2000 airing on the History Channel about this same phenomenon. Skeptical inquirer made a point to also talk about this. A web archive link is reproduced below (to prevent link rot): 

Most of the statistics I have found are prior to 1995, which is before the introduction of side and various other airbags (versus just front airbags). A critique that has been leveled at airbags in the past is that they were really only effective in front impacts (which was true prior to the introduction of the various other airbags). Monash University concludes that padding on all surfaces (such as provided by airbags) goes a great way towards reducing brain injury (although they also recommend drivers wear helmets if they really want to be safe). 

It sounds authoritative. And the number seven seems to be associated with a lot of things in western culture. 7 year itch. Lucky 7. Seven deadly sins. Why not add another thing that uses the number.
