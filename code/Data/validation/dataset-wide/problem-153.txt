Our world (Earth) right now is not completely at peace, each nation is really only looking out for themselves, so espionage, sabotage, economic domination, pressuring, and war deterrents still exist on a national scale. This can be shown even more clearly in a medieval world in that caravans could be attacked, and posting armies near borders or hiring mercenaries could be used to pressure other countries, Orcs could be seen by the international community as a "lost cause". if treaties have been made and broken by the orcs in the past, the other races and communities may have had to subjugate the orcs. This could include military occupation of their land, trade embargoes to cripple them, and general disallowing them to take care and lead themselves. This concept also opens the door to guerrilla warfare on the part of the orcs, in the manner of groups created by the orcs, trying to break away from the countries oppressing them. Vast and widespread economic issues would result in much more need for warriors and armies. If the vast majority of the world is in extreme poverty, warriors would be in high demand for protection of the wealthy against bandits, thieves, and uprisings/riots. This concept would also allow for plot developments involving the morals of the mercenaries in that the people the work are corrupt. Also consider having either a primitive race that isn't intelligent enough to engage in peace talks, so protection will be needed against them, or an extinct, highly advanced race that left mechanical or magical creations roaming the land/protecting ruins. (If you have them protecting ruins, the knowledge seeking elves would have a need for warriors/adventurers). I also like some of the other answers that were posted, like the idea of large predators and wars self contained inside individual races. Final quick random thought, could a type of portal be opened with another world requiring warriors/adventurers to explore it be opened? Or maybe there is some sort of terrorist / anti - establishment / anti - treaty organization exist that requires the countries involved in the peace to pool resources? Just a thought 

I see several possibilities for your world in general. And a few key points you should try to clarify in your world 

As highly unlikely as a common language would be, it would be possible in theory for there to be a language that makes learning it and other languages much easier. In our real world, we have Esperanto, which was developed specifically so that it would be a common tongue of the world, and make learning other languages easier to do. Although it didn't succeed, with only an estimated two million speakers worldwide, you are the ultimate arbiter of what goes and doesn't go in your universe, and therefore can declare that there's a successful example in your world. You could say that there's an international auxiliary language that's easy to learn and makes the learning and comprehension of other languages easier. Then, you could declare that to be the closest it gets to a common language. 

I am developing a fantasy universe. In it, then there are 6 Continents (Excluding Mapiya, which is in the sky): Agricet (Asia), Aztlan (Pre-colonial Meso/South America), the Biting Glaciers (The Arctic), Meristolem (Africa), Mystikicis (No real-world comparison, as it's essentially Atlantis if it didn't sink), and Skatallo (Europe). In-universe, there's a racial group known as Boga, or simply Goblins as humans call them. Within this racial group, there's the Chernoboga (Hobgoblins), the Sekirboga (Bugbears), and the Vulboga (normal Goblins, which are called Vulgar Goblins, or Common Goblins). Although the Chernoboga and Sekirboga are peculiar to the subcontinent of Silboga (Just in-between the Siberian-inspired area and the Chinese-inspired area), the Vulboga can be found on any continent in a variety of subspecies. For any additional context; Meristolem is largely dominated by a region known simply as the Blistering Sands, where the climate is inhospitable to most life forms, and the most monstrous and evil things reside, including an empire of very powerful slavers, known as the At'Azraqa. There are others like Ogres, Demons, Wyverns, and so on. The Biting Glaciers are a similar situation, only as a frozen wasteland. Aztlan's southern portion is a similar location, only in the form of the Savage Jungles. Mystikicis is densely urbanized and has many port towns. It is home to a highly advanced society in terms of Magic and Technology. My question here is as to likely subspecies of Vulboga that would develop for each continent, as every continent is supposed to have a subspecies of Vulboga present. What would be their physical traits in comparison to one another, and what would be the most prominent features to make them worthy of being of a different taxonomic classification from one another? 

Yes, because of FCC test modes A lot of people are assuming that a cell phone can only talk to a cell base station. If you are constrained to the end-user interface that is true, but if you can use your 100-year-future version of today's JTAG pod to get inside the firmware, the hardware itself will have been capable of transmitting an umodulated carrier at various frequencies during regulatory testing, and you can use that to send a slow Morse Code call for help. Then it's only a question if someone happens to be listening on a frequency you can reach; with luck some of the phone's frequency range will have become a ham band in the intervening years (and maybe someone is known by that community to be a on DX-pedition to an asteroid in your general direction, causing high-gain receive antennas to be pointed your way) It's theoretically possible that test modes on this level could be accessible from the keypad, especially as an oversight (lots of products have shipped with test modes someone forgot to take out, or maybe the phone's state gets corrupted by a cosmic ray, exposing something not meant to be exposed) A downside is that you won't know your signal has been received, until the rescue arrives. It may go further than you think We're used to thinking of handheld radios as having a short range, because signals may not readily wrap around the earth's horizon, clear obstacles, etc, and when they marginally do higher transmitter power can help. But conditions of good ionospheric reflection you can communicate around the earth on a few watts. And with line-of-sight in space power is even less of an issue. 

Depends on the Laptop This really depends on the laptop. If it just needs a stable DC supply, that can be done, but if it requires an activation signal as a brand-lock-in annoyance, then you are in for a lot more difficulty! DC supplies How you would produce a moderately high current regulated DC supply would depend a bit on era. In the solid state one, semiconductor diode regulators and transistorized regulation yields a fairly straightforward and practical design, albeit with a much heavier power transformer than the tiny high frequency ones used in today's switching supplies. Probably you can find something suitable for borrowing in an existing product (though perhaps not a consumer one). In an earlier era you may need more complicated rectification schemes, and high power low voltage filter capacitance will have to come from a very large array of low value capacitors. You may well end up with an AC operated motor driving a DC generator. Lead Acid Cells Another option to consider would be storage batteries. For example, one and a half "12v" car batteries starts to put you into the right range, and you are mostly targeting an era when car batteries would have been a maintainable array of individual cells held in a common crate, so getting a series connection of nine of them (one full battery, and 3 of the 6 cells in another) should not be hard. You can either charge the battery before use, or possibly use it as a bit of a stabilizer/regulator while connected to a power source. Emulate the Battery Pack If you do have a laptop which requires a brand-specific activation signal from the power supply, an option might be to disassemble the battery pack and try to emulate that, probably with some different number of contemporary chemistry battery cells, rather than provide the DC input. You may need to put some thought into emulating the output of a thermistor or other sensors. If the battery has an on-board management IC, you'll have to hope you can somehow generate conditions that satisfy it. Presumably you will shut the laptop down and charge your replacement battery independently of it. The USB Tragedy Once powered your computer will be usable as a manually interfaced data processing machine. A relay team of typists could accept input and produce output, but this will limit utilization of this unique-in-the-world resource. Back in the day when hardware serial and parallel ports were present, building an interface widgit with vacuum tube technology to collect inputs from and channel output to dozens of proto-teletypes would have been possible, but with the "legacy-free" switch to USB, not really. About the best that could be done if you decide to donate your services to a larger organization would be some kind of electro-mechanical speed typer to submit input jobs, and perhaps a film camera for capturing output ones for distribution back to the submitters. Preserve it It may be a good idea to remove the lower case of the laptop and build it into a console providing more and better filtered cooling air than the tiny ordinary fan can. If the keyboard fails constructing a replacement is actually fairly possible (which gives another input idea, but one whose risk may not be justified before the need). If the hard drive goes, you are in for a lot more trouble. With a PATA interface and the lucky accident of having brought printed documentation you might get somewhere towards constructing a replacement with 1970's digital logic or 1960's research-lab capabilities, with SATA you are out of luck, unless you want to have a go at emulating the bios flash. While it will be painstaking, while the machine works you'll probably want to do a hex dump of the bios, boot sector, etc and photograph every page for preservation. Better an older laptop For many of the reasons threaded trough this, you'll be best off with a laptop from the 1990's or even the 1980's. It won't be as absolutely powerful as a modern one, but still many orders of magnitude beyond any contemporary alternative in your destination time. More importantly, it will be more maintainable and interfaceable. The battery pack will be built around simpler NiCd or NiMH cells, the power input won't require an activation signal, the disk interface will be one old technologies could emulate and there will be I/O ports within the realm of interfacing, etc. 

In my fantasy setting, then there are two countries (Mapiya and Mystikicis) that are supposed to be the most magically and technologically advanced. I've already got the magical advancement more or less down, but not so much for the tech-level. This isn't without trying: I've thought of weapons, armour, transportation, medicine, and production of constructs, yet I always feel like they're too advanced for the setting. Just a bit of tech background for the Mystiks (people of Mystikicis), they used to have firearms and bombs, but after a massive wave of darkness and new demons in the Abyss (basically Hell), then they were able to detect that the wave was caused in some degree by firearms and bombs. They weren't entirely certain how involved the technology was, but they were able to tell that it had quite a bit of involvement. So to prevent anything similar from happening on Hraedmur (the planet they're on), they have forsaken the production of such weapons, and are purposely keeping other countries from learning such technologies exist in the first place. tl;dr They know what firearms and bombs are, they just don't use them. The Mapiyas live on landmasses in the sky, having been set up there through the use of a magical stony substance, by the ancient gods as a gimmicky resort for the wealthier, more pretentious gods (similar to underwater resorts in the real world). However, although they're supposed to be quite advanced, I haven't been coming up with much to show that. I've given them masks to protect their faces and breathe better during flight, but not much else. One example of one of the less advanced nations, though more advanced than most, are the Eulimites, who have developed a primitive flamthrower using flammable oils and a match. I've thought about using Wakanda (Marvel) as a base, but that didn't turn out well. Now I'm thinking something like the Protoss (StarCraft), wherein they infuse their tech with magic. Alternatively, I could go down a Dwemer (Elder Scrolls) route, though the Dwemer didn't use magic, seeing it as unnecessary, unlike the Mystiks who use lots of magic. Or I could try something similar to the tech of either the Makers or Angels (Darksiders). The main question is; How do I represent that the two countries have highly sophisticated technology while retaining a high-magic fantasy tone?
