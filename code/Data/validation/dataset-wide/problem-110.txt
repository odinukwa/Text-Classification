Consider a daemon created for delivering mail, with the public name "SMiTePa" and the private name "9d4f712". So, the work the demon does, is public. Anyone in the world, knowing its public name, may be able to use the service it provides; they write a letter, then burn it in their fireplace while saying "SMiTePa, Helo, please send this to john at the fishing net," and because this is the task for which the gods created the demon, and the correct incantation, then it will do this for them. If you are local to the demon, and are recognized as one of its managers, you can give it other commands; change who it will accept envelopes from, for example. But if you know the True Name of the daemon, and you are close enough to use it, and you have enough power, then you can do more, even if you are not one of its managers. You can make it give you a copy of each message, or you can even replace the demon with one of your own that delivers beer instead of envelopes. 

Apocryphally, moss always grows on the northern side of the tree (well, in the northern hemisphere at least). If you actually go out and try this, you'll find it works as poorly as you would expect. Surveying a large number of trees you might be able to establish a side on which moss grows best. But is that because that side is to leeward, northern-exposure, pointing-uphillest, or something else? [Edit: thinking about it, that possibly doesn't matter, so long as it's not the last option. If the moss is consistently directional, then you can use it for making sure your path does not diverge, regardless of whether you know what direction you are traveling in. So I suppose this does answer the question as asked, even though there are far better responses in other answers. Sadly, things like leaf direction won't tell you the direction you expect the sun to be, since the light is diffuse. This fact may also affect the moss thing: direct sunlight would make the effect far stronger.] 

According to myth, they were created when great trees displeased the Gods, and were cursed to lose everything above ground. And indeed, they do seem a little like plants - each one an immense tap root, wider than a house, drilling deep into the rock. They branch. Branches snake off horizontally through the stone, beloved by miners because the bloody wood is easier to tunnel through than rock. The branch-roots always end somewhere interesting - porous stone saturated in oil, an underground river, or even a seam of precious metals that perhaps, eons ago, used to be a hot mineral spring. But the main tap roots go only down. Perhaps they are nourished by magma. Perhaps they have found whatever lies beneath that. One thing we do know, is that they eat meat. Near the surface, the root swells to the size of a sports ground, and ends in a flat top in the soil layer. Once every decade or so, a seemingly innocuous patch of grassland will collapse when a group of animals is walking across. Whatever triggered the attack - a herd of cattle, a pack of wolves, a legion of troops - all fall into an open maw. Huge tentacles sweep across the nearby ground, blindly grasping anything that escaped and hurling them into the corrosive mucous in the throat. Eventually they calm, and weave themselves again into a lid over the pit, to eventually be hidden beneath wind-blown soil. Why do they do this? The amount they eat must be insignificant compared to the infinite body below. Perhaps it is indeed a curse. Perhaps they just like the taste. 

Although my answer is surely opinion-based, I think the answer is: probably never. The reason is, that if you would like to compare human and animal genetic code to a computer code, it would look like 0 % of logic and structure and hundreds of millions years of debugging. This is how evolution works: random mutations are created and if they are useful, they spread. Computer programming can also by done this way with use of genetic algorithms. The results are often effective, but completely incomprehensible to humans. Already today, we can insert almost any DNA we wish into a cell. One could write DNA as a long series of letters and we would be able to synthesize it. The problem is not in the technology, but that we do not know what it will do. Since it is so hard to understand the DNA code, fine changes will probably always require extensive amount of research and experiments. The code is just too messy to change it so simply. If all animals are "very poorly written", we might ask how close are we to writing animals from scratch. It also seems very, very problematic. Unlike life, our software is very hierarchic. Higher level of programming relies on precise translation into assembler-like processor instructions, which rely on processors performing very precisely many simple tasks. Even processor is basically a simple part - transistor - copied many many times into very precise structure. Each level works perfectly and can be completely separated from the next. This allows us to understand it and write software efficiently. Basic units of life - proteins, are much more messy. They do not by any way work so cleanly as transistors and one probably needs much more trials and errors to persuade the whole machinery of proteins to work as intended, cooperating with other proteins. My estimate is that we could still need hundreds of years to find a way around it. 

Tool use has been observed in the following animals: Primates (humans, chimps, bonobos, orangutans, capuchins, baboons, mandrills, macaques) Other mammals (bears, elephants, otters, dolphins, kangaroos) Cephalopods Reptiles (alligators, crocodiles) Insects (ants, wasps) Fish (wrasses, stingrays, damselfish, cichlids, archerfish) Birds (finches, corvids, warblers, parrots, vultures, nuthatches, gulls, owls, and herons). Not all of these use hands. In fact, they fall into three categories: 

One commonly given reason is to eat them. That is, to be awakened/brought back, requires a sacrifice. The blood of an X, a receptacle body to inhabit, a wife, the life force of another in order to give enough energy to materialize, whatever. The evil bad guy is not able to awaken without this, so cannot kill the X on his own. In some cases (wife, inhabitable body, nonfatal blood donation) the sacrifice might be a willing minion; otherwise, it's someone the minions catch and drag in. Either way, there's an unavoidable dependence on minion loyalty. 

In my imagination, I'd always imagined the best controller to be a little model of the ship, that you can pull around by hand, giving you the full 6 degrees of freedom. The closest to this that I ever found, and the best UI controller I've ever found for universal-degrees-of-freedom gaming such as Descent, is the SpaceOrb 360, which I believe is sadly no longer produced: 

From this, it seems that the best example we have is the vehicle. If aliens have eyes at the front, and find backing up or turning around in confined spaces to be awkward, perhaps from being long (someone suggested centaurs) or from being spined or shelled, then they are likely to build houses in a circular fashion, with a round central courtyard, then a corridor inside, then rooms arranged for suitable flow of movement around that corridor, each with an in and an out door. Their lives would be set up to facilitate this: different rooms at different times of day, perhaps following the sun. Operations like making a coffee would be arranged as linear process flows along the countertop. Causing someone else to have to back up or turn way would be considered rude. Perhaps all houses are "clockwise", or perhaps different cultures are set up to flow around their houses in opposite ways. Perhaps they alternate on each level. Perhaps some are figure-8 or cloverleaf. The important thing is that people can flow easily around their property without having to turn in place, or obstructing others (thus, passageways should be wide enough for two to walk abreast). 

Convincing 21118 Now that 2018 believes you, it's time to become famous. Accept every offer of academic conferences talks, co-authored history books and talk show appearances. Write your memoirs - if you can't write, make a deal with a publisher to hire you a secretary. If your English is too archaic for the mass market, work closely with a ghost writer. Money is no object - a book written by a genuine authenticated time traveller will sell millions. Have yourself 3D scanned, and get accurate statues made in granite and stainless steel. Spread copies all over the world - in public museums and protected vaults. Have big chunks of your DNA inscribed on vellum, and your fingerprints etched into titanium and launched into geostationary orbit. When it's time to leave, launch your time machine as a publicised event in front of a huge live audience. Have it recorded in every fashion - HD video, analogue film, monitoring by every scientific instrument available. Remove all doubt. Most importantly, every single time, state the date and place of your arrival in the future, as precisely as your time machine can manage. The aim is to get yourself mentioned so many times that unless civilisation collapses completely, some record of you reaches 21118 independently of yourself. Ideally, they are waiting to meet you. This works even if people in the future don't believe the old accounts. People will turn up at the time and place as an excuse for a party, expecting to have a great laugh at the expense of primitive 2018 people who actually believed in time travel! The very fact of materialising in front of their eyes and cameras will be all the proof you need.* If They Are Not Waiting... ...you will need additional evidence. Back in 2018, you need to have written a long message, and encrypted it. The encryption key must be very long, to prevent brute-force searches (remember, they have ~20000 years to crack it, with much better algorithms and hardware than we have today). The text must be even longer (otherwise a fraudster could choose a fake decryption key to create any plausible message). Perhaps it's the uncensored version of your memoirs. Perhaps it's an epic poem you write for a loved one you left in the past. When you encrypt it, do so repeatedly, with every algorithm your colleagues can track down, especially those that are thought to be quantum-safe. You don't care about public key, or "proper" digital signatures (you don't care about repudiation). Remember, it doesn't matter if it takes months of processing time to encrypt the message - you can spend as long as you like in the 21st Century before venturing on. Store your message in as many physical libraries, digital archives, vaults and satellites as you can. The people of 21118 must be convinced that you cannot possibly have corrupted so many copies in recent times, even with their technology. Hopefully, when you arrive carrying the decryption key, the idea that you are a time-traveller is more likely than your being a fraudster. 

Gravitational force field on the torus surface. Inner side of the torus is right, outer side is left. It may be counter-intuitive that the potential energy is equal on the whole surface, but the gravity strength is changing. Equal potential energy only means that the force always points into the surface and walking around does not require work. But the gravitational force will change. It is strongest inside the torus where the centrifugal and the gravitational forces add up. It is weakest at the outside, where they subtract. Results The most important result is that if you precisely balance the gravitational and the centrifugal force, the toroidal planet can indeed be stable. The planet must rotate very quickly, otherwise it will collapse to a sphere. In this case once in 2.65 hours. Other parameters valid for my planet are listed below, but there can probably be many others that work as well. 

Please note that the prefactor $6 × 10^{10}$ currently used on Wikipedia is very probably wrong, so I provided a more realistic one. (See the discussion.) The tidal locking is approximately exponential process, so it is very quick at the beginning and gradually slows down. Typical situation is, that planets in the habitable zone are tidally locked for red dwarf stars. Moons are very often tidally locked, unless they are very far from their planet. 

There is quite simple formula that will give you the tidal-locking half-time $$T = 6 × 10^{12}\, \frac{a^6 R \mu}{ (M_s M_p^2)}\; \mathrm{years}$$ 

By 21118, I would expect manufacturing technology to be so advanced that they could fake any physical evidence you could provide. Instead, I suggest you first convince us, in 2018, using tree rings and isotope evidence. You will become so famous that you are mentioned in millions of different books and records - so many, that in 21118 they will be actively waiting for you. Convincing 2018 Combine Tree Rings, Carbon-Dating and Radioactive Isotopes In your own time, cut down a tree. If you can get one that's more than about 73 years old, that's ideal (see below). Oak is apparently best (assuming you're in Europe). Cut out a section of trunk (i.e. a complete "wheel"), as thick as you can possibly fit in the time machine. Scientists will analyse the hell out of this, and will probably destroy a lot of material in the process. When you get to 2018, visit a university with a strong archaeology or mediaeval history department. Ask them, acting all innocent, if they could possibly help you work out how old this tree was. When they compare the rings against their records, they will realise, with high confidence, that the tree must have lived in the 14th Century. But you could just have carefully cleaned an antique stump. The real proof comes by taking samples and analysing the isotopes. Carbon dating shows how long ago something died - because your tree took a short cut, they will see that it only died recently. But a sufficiently resourced fraudster could have grown the tree in a giant warehouse, with artificial lighting and heating to mimic old weather patterns. This would recreate the historic ring pattern in a recent tree. Your clincher is the low levels of radioactive elements that were created in nuclear weapons explosions. These have contaminated (at low but detectable levels) the whole world since the 50s and 60s, and they would be extremely expensive to filter out of the hypothetical fake tree nursery. If your tree is old enough, a sceptic would have to explain why you paid for expensive isotopic filtering before you could have known about nuclear weapons. Now you can tell your real story, and they have a high chance of believing you. Your Own Body Your own body will feature the same low radioisotope levels as the tree stump. However, as soon as you start breathing, drinking and eating in the modern world, you will start to collect modern contamination levels. If you can immediately find a surgeon willing to sample and analyse your tissues, especially teeth, this will be good evidence. But I doubt many doctors are both ethically flexible and trustworthy enough for this to succeed.
