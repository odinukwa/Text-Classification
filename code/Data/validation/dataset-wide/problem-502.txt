This sounds like the shifting chain might be at the wrong tension. Look at the rear hub and you'll see a shifting chain that leads into the hub on the drivetrain side of the bike. If the Nexus 8 is anything like the Nexus 3 (which I have on my Trek cruiser), there'll be an adjuster barrel you can turn by hand to tighten or loosen the chain. One of the nicer features of the Nexus hub is an indicator window; you should see a yellow indicator in there, and two lines on the window to line it up. You may need to fine-tune this a touch by riding it down the block and back until it shifts perfectly. (In the event yours has no such indicator, try loosening or tightening the cable; the correct tension on the cable will allow you to use all the hub gears.) Edit: Was over at my friend's house today, he has a Jamis with an 8-speed Nexus hub. The indicator window is smaller than on my cruiser's 3-speed hub, but it's there. The window is right up against the spokes. 

Crazy Guy on a Bike, while not a social network, has some extremely active forums. While Bikeforums is much larger, since you commented that you're primarily interested in touring, you'd do well to check out CG. 

About to years ago, I had a brand-new Trail Rat battery die on me in the middle of a ride. Luckily, I had a maglite on me as a backup, and I rigged this up: 

Do I need a folding bike to do this? What are the rules? Also, even if it's allowed, is it practical to do so? Subways get pretty crowded during rush-hour, and it's hard to imagine taking a bike there even if it's allowed. 

Handlebar-mounted mirrors are generally larger in area and have a curved surface. (Think "objects in mirror are closet than they appear".) The ones meant for drop bars usually mount with velcro or another attachment system, and the ones for flat bars will generally be screwed onto the side of the bars. I've never found one I liked for drop bars, but the flat-bar mirrors work quite well. 

In the US, we're in the middle of a heat wave. Temperatures are topping 100 degrees F and up in some areas. When touring, how should one's eating and drinking before and during a ride be changed to deal with heat like this? If I don't chicken out, I'll be touring this weekend. I've ridden in temperatures like this before, but I'd like to make sure I'm not missing anything obvious. The usual way I deal with heat is to drink lots of water, eat properly, reapply sunscreen more often, and don't ride too hard; conserve energy and take a break during the hottest part of the day. (Noon to three, in my experience.) I keep my helmet padding wet, and make sure to eat salty food. However, I'm not sure if I should eat and drink the same kinds of things. For during-the-ride food, I've packed dried fruit, nuts, trail mix, energy bars, and I have five water bottles that I keep topped off. I'll have a camping load - around 40 pounds of stuff - and I usually keep a pace of around 10mph. This ride will be mostly on the roads, in the Pine Barrens of New Jersey, so there won't be all that much climbing. Specifically: 

However, that may be overkill. You might look into what's sometimes called a brake-band by the maker of the Click-Stand, an add-on for a parking stand for touring bikes. (The stand itself - a kind of tent-pole-like thing with a rest on the end that the bike leans into - would likely be overkill for am everyday use like this.) This'll hold the brakes on while the bike is parked, and stop the bike from rolling while parked. (You can purchase them from the click-stand site, or just make your own with pieces of velcro.) Here they are, hanging on the side of my bike in between uses: 

My Trek Pure Deluxe 3-speed cruiser has been making a clicking noise when riding for some time. The problem is faint, and is more felt than heard. However, it's been getting worse; it now makes a grinding noise if I'm mashing a bit when going uphill. The noise seems to happen when the right crank arm is facing forward. Which gear I'm in makes little difference. I've eliminated saddle noise (by pedaling out of the saddle) and have replaced the chain. Is there anything else at all that this could be, or should I just replace the BB at this point? 

Heavy cargo on a bike can raise the center of gravity. With smaller cargo, whether one uses a trailer or attaches the cargo to the bike (cargo racks with straps, panniers, a backpack, et cetera) is, to a point, a personal preference. (I don't know if there are recumbent cargo bikes, so I really can't comment on that.) However, when the cargo gets large enough, a trailer will become the best option for a couple of reasons: 

My touring bike needs new brake pads, and I'm about to do the swap. I've done it before, and plan to consult the usual YouTube videos to refresh myself in the procedure. (Brakes are something where one doesn't want to mess around.) Touring bikes have special concerns when it comes to brakes. In particular, they're carrying a lot of weight and need to be able to stop in all conditions. But it seems that my brakes on this bike are always too tight or too loose. How does one properly adjust the brakes on a touring bike? (The bike in question is a Novara Randonee with cantilever brakes. I'll be putting on two sets of Kool-stop dual compound brake pads. However, answers that apply to touring bikes in general would probably be more useful for all.) 

There are a few possible reasons for this. Vision You may need to develop your peripheral vision. Unless you have problematic eyesight, you can detect movement in your peripheral vision. This doesn't replace glancing around thoroughly, but it does give you a guide to unexpected movement. (Just a guess, but do you wear a balaclava? I have a loose one that I don't wear much because it cuts off my peripheral vision.) Mirrors Also, I find that an eyeglass mirror enables me to be quicker to spot things, because I don't have to turn my head to glance all the way behind me, just tilt my head a touch and refocus, without looking away from the road in front of me. Night vision If this is happening more at night, it could mean you need better lighting. It could also mean that you're having problems with night vision, or simply need glasses or a new prescription! Summary Much about staying alert in traffic comes down to practice. If it's the case that you need practice at this, be extremely careful and conservative, until you become more confident. 

After learning how to break a chain and reattach it, and also how to add and remove a master link, I find that I can now do much more in the way of maintenance at home. I'll no longer need to bring my bikes into the shop simply for a new chain... if I can only figure out how to identify what size chain I'll need to order. Is there a simple way of telling what size and type of chain I'll need to order to replace the chain on a bike? Do I measure the chain links? Count links? Count gears on the cogs? If it helps, some of my bikes' drivetrains have internal hubs, some have derailer gears. 

The conclusions you've drawn from your research are correct. There are racks that are specifically rated for child seats, and they attach to the bike's frame into a pair of rack stays near the seatpost as well as near the rear axle. Any rack rated for touring or hauling heavy loads reliably will use these attachment points at minimum. A child seat should be mounted on a rack that attaches firmly to the frame of the bike - which usually includes the seat stays near the seatpost. There are racks that attach onto the seatpost themselves, but these are lightweight racks, generally meant for bikes that need a rack only occasionally, or for road bikes without rack braze-ons; such "seatpost racks" are designed for easy removal and attachment, and are not designed to hold more than the weight of a daypack. Mounting a child seat on one of these would be horribly dangerous. I sincerely hope that you've misunderstood your shop. Attaching a child seat to a seatpost rack would probably break the rack and then harm the child. I suggest avoiding any shop that gave this advice. But I find it difficult to imagine that even a marginally competent LBS employee would recommend this. Is it possible that what the shop said was to get a rack that attached to the frame near the seatpost, as well as near the rear axle? Does your bike have attachment points in these locations? from your question, I'm guessing it doesn't, and I'd seriously reconsider and use a trailer instead of a child seat with your bike. 

The most common sizes of allen screws for bikes are 4, 5, and 6mm. There's even a common bike tool that will fit in all three. In my experience, most racks use 5mm screws, but some do use 4 or 6mm screws. Allen screws are generally used because flathead screws take longer to turn as the head slips easily, and phillips head screws strip easily. (I've heard that allen screws also work well with torque wrenches, but I can not verify this.) 

I'm planning to swap shifters and brake levers from one bike to another. One bike is a randonee with STI brifters, and the other is a Surly Long Haul Trucker with barends and separate brake levers. Both bike have 9-speed drivetrains, and are less than two years old. The Randonee is my bike, the LHT is not; a guy I used to ride with has agreed to the swap. (I prefer barends, he prefers the STI shifters.) The ideal way to do this would be for us to both bring our bikes to a mechanic and have the shop do the swap on the spot, if we can find a time that works for all three parties involved. Are there any potential pitfalls I should be aware of? I'm assuming we may have to replace some cables -- one bike is a larger frame than the other -- but are there any mechanical issues that are likely to arise? Are there any parts I'm likely to need to replace? 

Longer answer: You'll have to set up your route as multiple trips. (I did this when setting up my bike/train commute that involved, depending on when I got to Newark Penn Station in the morning, either three trains and two bike trips, or two trains and a bus and two bike trips, or three bike trips and two trains.) What you can do to make all this easier is to bookmark the locations of transit stops you'll be using often, as well as destinations. In the above picture, you'll see that Newark Penn Station has a star on it. That's because I have it bookmarked in Google Maps. Click on any destination or building or landmark on the map, and you can do this. It'll then show up on the map as a star, for easier mapping.
