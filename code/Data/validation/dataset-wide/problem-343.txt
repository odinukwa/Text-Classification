Its fair too say that as someone specialise's in one thing, they have less time to spend gaining knowledge in other things. This means discovery's that require knowledge of two fields at once are less likely to be found by that person - especially if it leaves a high level of detail in both. This does not mean humans as a species will stop developing, however. We have developed tools for communication, and structures for the exchange of knowledge. Its not unreasonable to assume we can use this to get past any "inter-discipline limits" on progress. For example; As long as facts are entered into databases in a readable format, and published in an way accessible to others, then its possible for computer programs to spot patterns that humans are unlikely too. A computer program could see correlations along the lines of "sunspots effect crops" only for things humans are infinitely less likely too see connections in. As correlation isnt necessarily causation, this would only give you a short list of potential things to investigate, which scientists could then study to see if its real. But it completely sidesteps the need for specialists in two fields to spot said connection. 

You should be clearer than 'digital' form. I will assume you mean scanning matter and storing it as information. It is currently feasible but they come in varying degrees of precision. We have Radar, Lidar, X-Ray Imaging, Thermal Imaging, CT (magnetic) scans, etc. A hypothetically advanced civilization could be able to accurately represent 'matter' down to atoms, however, they would not be able to represent quantum information with classical computers. That is only assuming our quantum theory is not bogus. Converting matter into energy is quite easy, as mentioned by Einstein decades earlier. The popular equation E=mc2 that allowed us to split the atom is actually Energy equals mass times speed of light squared. We're already doing that within nuclear reactors.

Here you can see the problem, for three objects orbiting each other, the movement becomes chaotic and unpredictable. This would also happen for the planets orbiting one of the binary stars. If we were to try and find out if such a system were possible, we would need infinite time to compute the numerical solution, since we do not, we cannot know which initial parameters would make such a system possible. Here I made a crude representation of what I mean. And in this case, the star collided with the planet... 

a) You travel to the past. b) This changes the future. Regardless of how careful you are. Even displaced air molecules count. c) Because of this your journey to the past is also changed, at least slightly. d) a>c sets up a feedback effect. You keep changing the past, which changes the future, which changes the past etc. e) This feedback loop potentially repeats forever. The only reason this feedback effect would ever stop is if a self-consistent timeline emerges. f) Therefor, to a outside observer without some godlike hyper-time observational powers the only time travel allowed is ones that result in the time travelers trip not being changed in any way at all by their own actions. Publicly introducing time travel would almost certainly do that - it would be a well known historic event. Therefor it cant be done. If time travel is possible at all, the trip must be observational only. Or, at least, no changes serious enough to effect the time traveler. 

It's probably not possible with the current setting. You've basically ruled out all forms of communication with different settlements of humans. Transportation is extremely difficult and there's no effective way to defend a settlement; any sizeable attack on a settlement will wipe it out unless they already have an effective wall, which they can't get because some of the monster with either fly or crawl over the wall or burrow beneath it. Islands are not an option either, because of flying monsters. Since humans can't effectively transport themselves they won't be able to found new settlements -- if they try, they will either be wiped out on the way or fairly quickly after they decided on a spot to live in. Without new settlements and since the old settlements won't survive, humanity probably won't survive for more than a single generation. How might it be possible? Have fewer monsters or reduce their relative power to humans. You could have dragons that will eat hundreds of people as long as they are rare and only do so once every ten years or so (maybe even as often as every year), but a constant onslaught of monsters will be impossible for humans to handle with a medieval level of technology. 

Now for planets to orbit a single star in that binary system, you would need to solve the n-body problem, a problem that is currently unsolved, because it is chaotic. If you do a simulation of three bodies for million of years, the result would be highly different than what we would see in real life. The errors of a numerical solution are just too great in cosmic timescales. $URL$ 

Assuming plants couldn't move, you can make the sentient plants be in a sort of "hive mind". Seeds could hypothetically move using stored energy reserves and colonize places as wished. Seeds that can slightly change their flight trajectory is not unthinkable, and you could make this easier by changing the climate on that planet. The atmosphere could be thicker, and with stronger winds. In stark contrast to humans, plants could build stuff by taking its shape, then die. Sacrificing some for the good of others. Of course, technological evolution in those conditions would take 1-2 orders of magnitude longer compared to animals that can move. 

Look at Europe Almost all the European countries have had elections for senates and/or congresses, or whatever you want to call it, while retaining a powerful monarchy -- that's pretty much what you're asking for. Usually, the monarchy would deal with defenses while the elected officials dealt with everything else, including lawmaking, with plenty of examples where this is not the case. The real crux seems to be who controls the judges -- if the monarch do, the democracy part of the society is pretty moot. Otherwise, the monarch is just the government -- something akin to the cabinet of ministers in a European democracy (+ any head of state, such as a president akin to how the USA is governed). Look at Scandinavia The Scandinavian kingdoms used to have their kings elected when the old king (was)[1] died, and I seen no reason why a democracy can't have an elected emperor or king in the same way.

To conclude, an intelligent commander would use all the best characteristics of mechs to create an automated, multi-purpose robotic swarm that is able to cheaply and quickly overwhelm the enemy. It is quite frightening indeed. Of course, big mechs are inherently slow and bulky, smaller mechs would be the way to go. Now you might think, if this is so GREAT, why hasn't any army developed mechs already? Good question. The reason is that programming bipedal motion is hard... (EXTREMELY hard) (As a computer science student I can attest to that) It took millions of years to evolve bipedal motion, and even for children, it takes 3 years to properly learn how to walk. Armies are pouring tons of money into developing quadrupedal motion. Why not bipedal? Because if the robot cannot even walk with four legs, forget even thinking about walking on only two legs. So while two-legged mechs are cool in theory, they are really hard to make. However, you should anticipate quadrupedal mechs coming in the next decade or so. To give you an idea of what it would look like:
