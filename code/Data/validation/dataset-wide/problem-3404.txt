Well, this is really a basic mathematics or physics question. The frequency of a sound is "F0" if and only if "1/F0" is the smallest possible period of time for which pressure (t) = pressure(t+1/F0) for each moment of time "t". To be able to define the frequency means to define the periodicity of the pressure waves (sound are oscillations), and the frequency (in Hz) is the inverse of the periodicity (in seconds). For example, a tone with the frequency 500 Hz is periodic and the oscillating pressure gets repeated every 1/500=0.002 second. However, no such exact periodicity exists for the human voice – which also means that "F0" isn't quite well-defined, either. The vibrations of the vocal cord are complicated and not periodic. They are close to periodic ones but not quite periodic: they are "quasi-periodic". It means that some frequency "dominates" but it cannot be determined exactly. The vibrations of the vocal cord are aperiodic because different points of the vocal cord vibrate independently and the vibrations can't be divided to simple harmonics because they affect each other, due to "nonlinearities" of the equations governing the vocal cord. Ideally, one could consider sounds that are periodic, with the periodicity "1/F0". Such sounds may be written as "Fourier sums" (Fourier series, Fourier expansions) over the frequency "F0" and the "higher harmonics" such as "2*F0", "3*F0", and so on. Each of these higher harmonics would have some coefficient which would describe the "color" of the sound. However, the human voice isn't quite periodic so the Fourier series aren't enough. We need a full-fledged "Fourier transform" in which all frequencies, and not just a multiple of "F0", are represented. Some frequencies around "F0" (and partly its multiples) make higher contributions but the other frequencies can't be completely neglected. 

The sounds "i" and "ie" are not the same; "ie" is basically a long "i". The German spelling remembers the pronunciation. The digraph "ie" plays exactly the same role as the long (acuted) "í" or "ý" in Czech language (or other Baltic and Slavic languages using the Czech diacritics and the Latin alphabet) whose pronunciation differs from the simple "i" or "y". To replace "ie" by "i" would mean that the pronunciation in German is no longer determined by the spelling – a huge sacrifice. Completely analogously, the German digraphs "ah" and "eh" create the long "á", "é" different from the simple short "a", "e". If a reform should take place, German should use "á,é,í,ú,č,š,f,v" instead of "ah,eh,ie,uh,tsch,sch,v,w", and there are a few other replacements that would simplify the German spelling. I have actually written down some more detailed plans for this reform. ;-) 

There is no language where these fusions are absent altogether. But you have sensibly picked a Slavic language where the diversity of different cases is sort of maximized. I am a Czech speaker, not a Serbo-Croatian one, and I couldn't find a clear proof that your declension of Zdenka is incorrect on a page of Serbo-Croatian grammar. But the claim that the feminime Zdenka has the instrumental "Zdenkom" as well sounds highly surprising to me if I don't say implausible. They organize their declension classes very differently than Czech but at the end, their words sound "reasonable" to our ears. And "Zdenkom" simply sounds masculine and it is hard to imagine that they use the same form for a feminime name. In Czech declension, this particular problem surely doesn't arise. We have the masculine and feminime names Zdeněk and Zdeňka (nominatives), respectively. (A grandmother and her late husband from my broader family had these twin names.) The instrumentals are Zdeňkem and Zdeňkou, respectively (templates: pán [masculine animate, Sir], žena [female, woman]). I would expect the feminime suffix in Croatian to be "-ju" or something like that. Perhaps Zdenkoju? But you must be right. A name similar to Vito is Vít (or Vítězslav), informally Víťa, the accusative is Víta, Vítězslava (template: pán again for both), Víťu (template: předseda [masculine animate, chairman]). A feminime name doesn't exist but it could be Víta but the accusative would be Vítu, not quite the same as any of the previous ones. It's usually guaranteed that the masculine and feminime names aren't the same – and if they sound the same, it's often "deliberate". Like the Serbo-Croatian ones, Czech nouns recognize declension in 7 cases, nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, vocative, locative, and instrumental – which is unusually close to our Latin roots (there is a difference; among the 7 cases in both languages, the Latin ablative is replaced by the Czech – and similarly Polish – instrumental). Vocative (a special case used while calling someone) is alive in Czech and only a few other languages in the world. We call: Baracku! Obamo! Havle! Francisi! Fiorino! And so on. Our children don't learn the Latin names of the cases. Instead, we call them "Who/what", "From whom/what", "To whom/what", "whom/what", "we're calling, we're screaming", "about whom/what", "with whom/what". These translations sound better in Czech because pronouns such as "whom/what" undergo declension, too. At any rate, prepositions are linked with cases. Not all the 7 cases are always different, but that's a part of the design because certain cases can't be confused too easily. Quite generally, the genitive and accusative are the same rather often; and the dative and locative are the same often, too. The vocative may coincide with the nominative if no natural variation exists (and for many truly exotic names – but as I have mentioned, we do use inequivalent vocatives even for foreign names; and we also create the feminime versions of the names, so for example, a presidential candidate is named Hillary Clintonová). Note that the German declension only has four cases. The original seven ones in Latin have been largely "unified" along similar lines as the similarities discussed in the previous paragraphs suggest. Quite generally, we almost never face any confusions of this sort in Czech. But that doesn't mean that all the cases are different. The accusative of a masculine word may often be the same as the dative of a feminime word, and so on. For example, the feminime nominative name Zdeňka is also the accusative and genitive of Zdeněk while the nominativ masculine Zdeněk is also the form of the plural genitive feminime, (several/několik) Zdeněk. But it's very difficult to construct sentences where it could lead to confusions. With this declension system, the order of the world becomes rather arbitrary – although different orders do try to convey slightly different meanings. For example, the last word may often be what we emphasize. I made the sandwich for you (Udělal jsem ti sandvič). In Czech, one may say it in this way, and "for you" is the main message – it is you who was happy to be made this sandwich. Or: Made the sandwich for you I. (It is me who should be celebrated for preparing the sandwich.) Or: Made for you the sandwich. (Out of the things that I could do for you, I chose the sandwich.) Also, the declension removes some prepositions relatively to English. Give something "to someone" is expressed as a simple dative of "someone", without any "to", and the instrumental may similarly represent the English words "by someone" while the genitive is also used as "someone's". On the other hand, many prepositions still survive and they're unavoidable (it's clear that nontrivial if not very complex prepositions meaning "through" and "across" and "underneath" and many others can't be modeled by simple cases in the declension system, we would need dozens of cases in that case). So for example, "make me a sandwich" is "udělej mi/mně sandvič" (or "udělej sandvič pro mě", pro=for) while you need to say "udělej ze mě sandvič" if you want the sandwich to be made out of you ("z/ze" is "out" or "from"). The preposition guarantees that confusions are avoided here. But even without it, there could be no confusion in the written form of "mě" and "mně" because it's spelled differently (genitive=accusative and dative=locative of "I", "já", respectively). But "mě" and "mně" is actually pronounced exactly the same (this is a true exception that two differently spelled words are pronounced the same – if we don't count the example where -d and -t is pronounced the same etc.). But again, it's largely the prepositions that guarantee the absence of real confusions. I believe that the dogma that the last vowel is never cutoff and modified in the declension rule is absolutely unrealistic in natural languages, and if that's a rule obeyed by Esperanto, it's a way to see that it's an artificial language. Declension naturally is supposed to change the ending. The other cases aside from the nominative are supposed to be pretty much equally long as the nominative. The word "declension" and its Czech counterparts mean something like "bending", "tilting" – so the length should be the same, just the "direction" (chosen vowel at the end etc.) should vary depending on the case. If there is a general rule saying that all the other cases are longer, there is almost no advantage of this system in comparison with a proposition (or some post-position) for everything instead of the cases. 

No, the two words are not related. There is neither a direct relation nor a negation. "Shew" is an old version of "show" which comes from proto-Germanic "skauwojan", i.e. choose, look at, and other verbs. Even in Proto-Indo-European, there is "skeue", pay attention. On the other hand, "eschew" is from proto-Germanic "skeukhwaz", i.e. escape. 

The "sea pigs" in English is translated from "porci marini" in Latin not just because they have similar snouts as pigs do. They also use it in the same way. When gathering food, they submerge their snouts in the sand. Well, they look like pigs, too (look at the round shape with seemingly redundant mass), and have a similar pink color, too. All nations and cultures must have noticed the similarity. The terminology is not related to their taste, so it's irrelevant that the Asian speakers didn't eat sea pigs. If they named things according to the taste, they wouldn't call them "sea pigs", anyway, because sea pigs actually taste like chicken. In some regions of Japan, they eat dolphins and use their fat instead of pork lard. 

The modern Icelandic alphabet was introduced by Danish linguist Rasmus Rask – and perhaps a few colleagues – in the 19th century. He was trying to respect the 12th century text The First Grammatical Treatise about Old Norse as much as possible. In particular, "eth" was not used for a few centuries before Rask (which is why Rask's reform had a big impact on the practical life in the 19th century) but it was used in Old Norse around the 12th century. So it's historically misleading to say that "eth" is Anglo-Saxon: when one gets further to the past, to the true origins, it's a North Germanic (Old Norse) letter. At the very beginning, the first usage of the letter was in Irish (meaning the Celtic language) but there always existed some cultural exchange between the "adjacent" islands. 

The complex sentence without quantifiers cannot be replaced by "x dislikes the fox" because the article "the" (and the logic of the short sentence) would implicitly say that there only exists a single particular "fox". But that isn't necessarily the case. y was a free variable and it must be possible to incorporate it in many ways; while "the fox" is a name for a particular entity, so it can't be embedded in sentences with quantifiers. For example, you may add both "for every y" or "there exists some y" in front of the sentence "the x dislikes y and y is a fox" – but not in front of "the x dislikes the fox". Only with the existential quantifier, you may simplify "there exists y such that y is a fox and..." by "there exists a fox that...", other propositions cannot be simplified. 

A vowel has two closely related but inequivalent definitions. One of them looks what's happening in the mouth etc. Vowel is a sound in which the tongue doesn't touch anything and there's no build of pressure anywhere. That's why the sound may last uniformly and that's why it has the potential to be the peak of a syllable. The sound that allows a syllable to exist is the other definition of a vowel. The consonants you mention – for example, in Czech, most famously, "L" and "R" – may form syllables, so they satisfy the syllabic definition of a vowel (my last name is "Motl" with an "L" and has two syllables; similarly "prcek" with "R"). However, they don't satisfy the tongue-and-pressure-based definition of a vowel so "L" and "R" are still considered consonants (although they are "syllabic nuclei"). On the other hand, vowels (by their sound) may fail to be the bulk of a syllable and they may be treated as consonants. These sounds are called "semivowels" and in English, "y" (in "yes") and "w" (in "west") are examples of such semivowels. By the essence of their sound, "y" and "w" are vowels. After all, "y" is a relative of "i" and "w" is the "double u". But because they're not the most important or long-lasting part of English syllables, they behave as consonants.
