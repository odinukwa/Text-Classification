So to summarize if you had a decent enough repair man and a source of electricity to make oil (abandoned plant, wood powered steam engine, hand cranked alternator) you could keep a car running for a pretty long time in such a scenario and if you got a hold of certain parts probably pretty close to indefinitely. (I'm thinking zero wear plastics, ceramics, or super-alloys like you might find in racing or experimental parts but used at <40 mph on a regular car). It however would definitely be hard as you would need to find the solution to each issue rather quickly to prevent the issues from being "insurmountable". If nobody paid attention to the issues it would be pretty easy, as others noted in their answers, to run all the viable autos into the ground. 

I think about this a lot for similar reasons and I can tell you from the research I've poured in (too lazy to dig atm) that intermolecular bonds are weak. If you have magnetic, kinetic, thermal, light, gravitational, chemical, sonic, and electrical energy as sources of damage. And break kinetic into momentum transfer, piercing, and slashing. Slashing and piercing win in most scenarios (positing uber future tech). Every energy form has it's own issues to deal with. Gravitational is pretty be-all end-all. At current understanding gravitational would block most things and penetratingly damage most things. (I'm going to break the following into simple sections, but realize bludgeoning could be seen as piercing with a large cross-section, etc.) An example of extreme levels of kinetic spear/shield scenarios: 

They could manufacture agricultural items such as plows and digging tools. It does not need fuel to work which they need. They can do repairs as well. Basically fulfilling the roles of blacksmiths. This of course depends on the overall technological capabilities of the surrounding communities that trade with them. They can also do assembly of machinery given the specs are available or in the overseer's memory/database. Additionally they can trade information in manufacturing and calculations as well such as how deep to dig a well given certain parameters etc. This could prove more valuable than tools. 

You could have underwater trains. Think hyperloop and such. Since your world is covered in water you cna have underwater dome stations and maybe cities as well that juts out to the ocean surface. Makes for an interesting social hierarchy as well but that's outside of your question so yeah maybe toy around with the idea for underwater trains. 

Ok maybe not mechs, but exosuits. Powered limbs, pressurized suit, armored protection, comms, manueveraibility via jets placed on the feet and back. The suit would have to be large though so a 1.8 meter person would probably bulk to about 2.5 to 3 meters or so (rough estimate based on eyeballing existing spacesuits). They'd be armed with grappling hooks they can throw, mini-rockets (careful of that recoil) and maybe a knife or two for close combat. Not sure how much damage they can do to a medium to heavy armored station, base or craft though since arming themselves with heavy missiles might be too cumbersome and problematic given space's physics. Mines and explosives though may be feasible. Anyway, point is, you can use exosuits and they can look more mecha if you want and if they have specialized roles then you can alter their look and feel too. 

[1] There are one-way chemical reactions due to the statistical nature of the chemistry. The entropy is always entropy and it guides the rolling of the die so that the chemical reaction plays out the way it does. [2] On the point about physics being non-local: I might be reading into recent journalism hype but it sounded like this was determined by old experiments and equations I've read about before (transitioning from hypothesis to "cannon law") [3]The fact that this independent variable exists in the way that dark matter does would seem to imply its either has a input of light in its equation or it uses it's own equation to bend light around it. Since we're adding your condition that scalons can also rearrange molecules and atoms they must have control over the strong and weak force. Since scalons can control scalar energy your assuming a 5th form of energy tied to these particles and that it can be converted to/from EM energy. That implies that it either depends on an EM equation and it isn't an independent variable but part of the system or it's an independent and due to its near-omnipotent nature a source of a lot of the hidden variables etc. 

Vesta, Ceres and the Moon to scale at 20 km per px I’m just using the figures for Europa and the depth of its subsurface ocean, which is kept liquid by tidal heating, and assuming the situation is similar - so this is just a rough estimate as it would depend on what you have by way of an energy source to keep your planet or moon warm. With just surface heating, surely the center would cool down eventually. Tidal heating could be a way to keep your planet liquid just as for Europa, so if you make it so that it orbits a hot Jupiter - those are planets like Jupiter that end up in orbits close to their sun, and they may well have liquid water moons. Another solution, without the layer of ionic liquids or similar, is to have a constant influx of comets to replenish the water. I can imagine some scenarios where that could work, e.g. soon after formation of a solar system. It also might work for a while later on in a white dwarf star with material brought into it through destruction of its Oort cloud and perturbing effects of an extra planet, see Our Solar System Could Lose One Or More Of Its Gas Giants Billions Of Years In The Future - and that would also help keep it hot. In a situation like that maybe even quite a large minor planet would stay hot enough to stay liquid all the way through. But the tidal heating + surface thin layer seems the easiest solution to me. So, in short, I think this scenario could actually exist in nature, if you don’t mind having an ocean rich in organics, covered with a thin layer of organics, and make it a moon orbiting a gas giant rather than a planet on its own. This is just a rough estimate. Would be interesting if someone was to do a paper on it - has anyone? Would a liquid water world the size of Vesta or even Ceres be possible, with tidal heating to keep it warm? Can a hot Jupiter have a moon of pure ice? (I don’t see why not if it formed far enough away from its host star originally, but would be interesting to know how likely that is). This is a copy of my quora answer to Is a planet entirely made of only liquid possible? 

Probably somewhat painful, depending on how much you age. I would think the more prevailing sensation is weakness of limbs and a sense of lethargy as energy is sapped out as well and your cells, bones and body parts age prematurely. 

How can a population or civilization develop empathy to the point where they feel another beings emotion if they are only a few feet away regardless of species and even if they are familiar with the emotion or not. The only limitation is that they cannot broadcast emotions, just receive them. The level of empathy ability I am looking at is above what humans have today. More in line with strong telekinesis or telepathic abilities. 

You can use terrain to your advantage. A gorge with a width opening on the enemy side narrowing down to a small opening will help to make the waves manageable. If its a flat plain, a fall back, ranged strategy might work if the plain is big enough. Couple this with area attack weapons such as mortar, bombs, mines etc. Air support (not sure what your tech level is) would also be good as they can soften up and even wipe out waves without having the ground troops go into it. Mortar, artillery etc. basically keep your distance. If your tech level permits it, then automated weapons towers could work even better and they can fire off pulses of electricity, streams of fire, or plasma etc. 

GIMP/Photoshop can actually pull off every necessary transformation of that data set using built-in filters, if your willing to give up accuracy a little bit. Just think out the connections you want to model. The one's it can't model, you could script in or use other software (one example being measuring insolation. I don't know of a way in standard GIMP to make a shadow map from a height map. QGIS can automatically do this for you though). TimB's great series of questions on world-building will probably end up covering more than you care to model but: 

In conclusion, I'm not an expert but after a fair amount of research it seems like you could just wing it and you'd be good. Disruptions in the clouds are still being explained (magnetism, etc.) so as long as you explosions are roughly uniformly distributed (or so densely packed we missed it), your probably good to go. 

There's almost certainly more points I haven't considered here. Definitely make sure it's consistent though. Cultures tend to bleed across political boundaries for example. Edit: I talked with an armor smith. A major additional point under the military bullet is the fact that you live in your armor at war, so ceremonial/tournament armor would be designed differently than war armor. 

Based on that, you could have a minor planet made of ice, 260 km in diameter, and consisting entirely of water, I think, with a surface layer of organic ionic fluids or a scum of organics in solid form floating on the surface. That could last for billions of years. That makes it about the same size as 88 Thisbe 

Assuming you mean a liquid ocean of water which beings sufficiently adapted could potentially swim all the way through, it would have to be small because water when compressed enough becomes ice - or else - to have a hot core, which it might have soon after formation, or be tidally heated. So, first, the easiest case, if you don’t need it to have enough gravity to hold an atmosphere, I don’t see why not. Basically you want a large comet, in an orbit which keeps it permanently liquid. We could create such a world artificially in our solar system with mega engineering by diverting a comet into just the right orbit around the Sun. However, unless we add something extra to the picture, it wouldn’t last long. The problem is that water evaporates rapidly in a vacuum. And to have enough gravity to stop that happening With surface temperature of 273.15 K and using the equation for mass loss of liquid water in a vacuum of (pe/7.2) * squrt (M/T) kg / m2 / sec (equation 3.26 - compare calculation results here: Modern Vacuum Physics) where M is the molar mass, T is the temperature in kelvin, pe is the vapour pressure, which for water at 0 C (273.15 K) is 611.3Pa, (Vapour pressure of water at 0 C), M = 0.018 kg, gives (611.3/7.2) * sqrt(0.018/295) = 0.663 kg / m2 / sec. So you lose about 57 meters a day thickness of liquid water exposed to a vacuum, or about 20.9 kilometers of water per year. The rate of loss goes up if the temperature increases and is 2.495 kg / m2 /sec at 295 k, or 22 C. That’s 215.6 meters per day and 78.6 km per year. So, a liquid water comet would not last for long. That is unless you get a constant influx of other comets bringing more water to it. What if the object is large enough to retain liquid water for long periods of time?That’s only possible if it has at least enough gravity to retain a significant amount of atmosphere, even if the atmosphere is just water vapour, or oxygen (after dissociation of the water by radiation). ~But then - it will surely have a solid ice core. In that case, if the water is also salty, it might well have a “club sandwich” type pattern of alternating layers of ice and water as suggested for Ganymede, of various types of ice, with some of them “snowing upwards” [] Ganymede׳s internal structure including thermodynamics of magnesium sulfate oceans in contact with ice But even Ganymede is not large enough to retain an atmosphere to protect the surface layer of water. Its diameter is 5,268 km so if brought close enough to the Sun to have a permanently liquid surface layer, it would vanish completely in 67 years. It could build up a temporary atmosphere though as the water evaporated. It’s gravity is similar to the Moon’s. Can we terraform the Moon? If yes, how difficult is it and is it possible with the current technology? So using a calculation from that answer, if you hit it with a comet 164 km in diameter you’d have enough material for an atmosphere which would last for 10,000 years. Since the volume goes up as the cube, that means with a similar pressure atmosphere, a moon the size of Ganymede could last for 10,000*(5,268/164)^3 = 331 million years before evaporating completely if it built up an Earth pressure atmosphere. And the atmosphere would consist of water vapour and oxygen, so might well be breathable too, especially if you can somehow introduce some nitrogen as a buffer gas. But that’s still no good if you want the core to be liquid all the way through. There is another solution though. If you are willing to do it artificially, you could cover the entire surface of a small comet with a low density liquid which also has a low evaporation pressure. Indeed, comets are rich in organics anyway, so if you could bring a comet to just the right distance from the Sun, not too far, not too close, then as it melted, it would develop a layer of scum like that. And that might well be habitable too, with organics and an oxygen rich ocean too, due to similar processes to the ones that make Europa’s ocean oxygen rich. Organics with a high evaporation rate would disappear leaving only those with a low evaporation rate, and perhaps solid layers as well. So if you are okay with your planet being a tiny comet sized object, and your water can be a bit “dirty” with organics, which means it can also support life, I’d say yes, it does seem possible. Europa’s ocean may be as much as 100 km thick, with a surface layer 10 - 30 km thick. 

While the other answers covered this realistically I think you can take another spin on it. For a large net charge I believe you'd have some interesting effects. (the following is based off logical reasoning on the bold item scaled up to planetary sizes). Thinking of the atom: It would be stable up to a very large charge just due to the weight. At larger charges the the center might become less dense but the surface gravity would not be effected. Thinking of an electric generator: If objects were oppositely charged they'd probably generate magnetism in the negative object, huge electrical storms, and possibly arcs if close enough. They would at the very least generate an ion stream. It would change the distances and speeds of the orbits but would not effect the shape. Thinking of Ionizing Radiation: Life doesn't like ions and you have a lot of them flying around, especially if the flow is from the planet instead of from the sun. So you'd probably have none of it. As the percentage of charged particles increased the chance of forming compounds would go down as nothing would be forming ionic bonds and two ions don't really like to form covalent ones. I don't know about planetary-sized objects, but at least for star-sized ones you'd have some very different materials than normal in the core, as they would bond despite charge. Thinking Dust Wiper: We have materials such as microfiber which exhibit electrostatic adhesion (there's a name for this type of material if someone can find it), and your charged objects would behave just like them, pulling in oppositely charged objects and probably trying to ionize the other object and end up pulling it in anyway (like amber does when it exchange charge). So expect any passing ships to stick to your planet like tape. 

For protection, a clay encased wooden shield covered in vinegar and alum can be resistant to fire ($URL$ Leather armor treated with alum could help protect the troops as well and give the mobility that is crucial in fighting dragons whether close or far. This is just for the fire attacks though. Long barbed spears and spiked nets can hinder the dragon's movement a bit, where specialist troops can use containers filled with gunpowder to lob it at the beast. Basically bombs/grenades, since the tech does allow for it. The spears can also be used to entangle or rip at the wing membrane of the dragon if it has it. 

You can also explore the possibility of increased gravity. Creatures from a world with a high gravity would be either become smaller or larger. See this Reddit ($URL$ It really depends on how you want the outcome to be. If the stronger/higher gravity was not sudden then life would evolve to fit the environment and that would include denser bones, probably larger lungs and multiple hearts to support the body, muscle density becomes higher and would make creatures larger. I've read a few books I think it was Pip and Flynx by Alan Dean Foster (don't quote me on this) where one of his species was large and strong due to living in a higher gravity world. 

Let's flesh out your planet some more so I can point out some potential problems. (Which admittedly are exacerbated by my "fleshing"). I hope I didn't fail in my physics but even if I did the first set of problems applies even to a Dyson Sphere or Ringworld. Alright first the wishes/problems-list: 

Agree with Joe Bloggs answer. But for fun let's investigate Temporal Ethics: Would Temporal Ethics develop in most time-lines with confirmed time-travel? Almost certainly. It's certainly an easier topic than regular Ethics. for simplicities sake let's define a minimal ethics framework. You have a moral choice, a moral action, a goal state, and a moral function. A choice can be moral but the action could be unsuccessful in actuating the choice. Likewise if observed individually the morality of an action or choice could change (local, "kill one", versus global, "save many", properties). You have a goal that you're optimizing for (most number of people with most happiness, etc.). You also have a guiding function that let's you determine morality (religion, common opinion, game theoretic, random, etc.) in relation to the goal. Much of ethics will deal with what is good and bad and try to precisely define the function. Regular ethics will likewise try to define the goal state as it provides a reference for building the metric that is the guiding function. But there's good news! Temporal Ethics need only concern itself with the temporal aspects. That is, we don't need to define what is good, that's for regular ethics, we just need to define how our temporal aspects relate to the classical problem. The entirety of Temporal Ethics in actuality would be concerned with pinning down what time-travel is and how it effects the current time-line, as well as determining the dangers and weighing them in risk analysis, since regular ethics covers the other questions. As luck would have it we have WOG on the physics of the matter so we can bypass the quibbling part of Temporal Ethics and get down to what the "Final Conclusions" would be. Is there a justification or even an imperative to build a time machine and travel with it if the present cannot be changed? No. Based on your premise, you cannot affect your own time-line whatsoever, if you could (destabilize the universe or whatever) then you could communicate and the main time-line would be self-reinforcing OR paradoxical. So, since we know there is no effects, there is no downside to time-travel. Each time-traveler basically makes his own universe when he travels. He populates a universe with initial conditions based off of however he acted to change the time-line and cause the split. He basically sets the goal to optimize for, he sets the goal. With two caveats: the moral functions that the people develop may not coincide with the "spawner's" goal. And there may be a "super-goal" either by being carried forward from the root of the tree or from an "extra-universal thing". If you keep traveling until you get to a universe that's altruistic/egotistic enough for you then you're really just tweaking your initial conditions until you get it right for what you want. Each attempt abandons the universes you were in prior. Would it become a moral imperative (good) to change the past for the better even though that won’t affect one’s own present? No. There are two ways of looking at this: "Existential Probability" and "Existential Certainty". In the probability you want to increase the number of universes that are "good" so that the many copies of other folks might somehow live a "better" life, for some definition of "better" :). Now the problem is that you already have a main/prime time-line that is "good"/"bad". IF your initial jump does not cause perfect "good" you're screwed statistically. If you create a "bad" universe you'll have to jump again to try to do better. If you create one with the same level of "good" as the main universe you've achieved none of your goal. You have actually made it worse because each jump further increases the value of N, where N is the number of universes. Your goal as an altruistic time-traveler is to increase the average "good". Even a perfectly neutral jump diminishes the returns from future efforts. Likewise one "bad" jump could take a long time to repair. Since your first travel "determines" the average for a fairly significant amount of time you would NOT travel unless you were extremely certain of the results or desperate in your own time-line. Which brings us firmly into the risk-analysis territory of "Temporal Ethics". The other option to look at the morality is "Existential Certainty". Rather than discussing odds you discuss "empirical facts". YOU exist. You cannot effect another you. When you decide to travel, the new you is created on a separate time-line and the old one stays home unaffected. Since you are isolated you exists entirely within your current universe. Which may or may not have one time-traveler. You are certain of your existence. You are also certain that everything, including yourself, is existing in your universe and the probabilistic "good" matters not one lick, you have certainty, you can measure things and they will be unaffected by anything having to do with time-travel. You only can have zero time-travelers present if you're in the main universe. Otherwise there was certainly one time-traveler in your universe. Likewise you are certain that no time-travelers will ever enter your universe because the only one allowed always existed since the beginning. In fact, you might owe your existence to said person. The time-traveler leaving could cause an exiting effect on your universe (related to what is coming: We have no way of determining the effect of you leaving on the universe prior to your arrival in said universe). Since you could potentially independently time-travel you can be assured that your traveler leaving will not cause your universe to disappear. (Unless there's restrictions on time-travel outside of the main time-line which makes "Probabilistic Existence" increasingly more of a risky prospect). If you have all theses certainties then it doesn't matter if you travel. Everything in the new universe will have these same certainties and they will be permanent on entry. You can only create, never destroy. If existence is defined as "bad" in your new universe then they can easily destroy themselves, or in a pinch you can lend a hand. Otherwise they get what they have for "good" and "bad", they can change it themselves by either ordinary means or time-travel to a new universe with different "good"/"bad" ratios. Crucially, they cannot affect any other "good" or "bad" in any pre-existing universe. So as long as you existed before the created universe then "good" and "bad" mean nothing to you as far as time-traveling. And if you existed after then you just have to set about fixing whatever you find wrong. (Note that I don't consider that we should consider the feelings of the created universe. They don't matter. Simply because the probabilities are spread across the gamut of possibilities for "good" and "evil" and we have no objective way to deterministically quantify the amounts for all of time in the created universe or our own. So since you can't consider it: you shouldn't consider it. The best you could do is plot risk analysis for you unknown unknowns vs your known unknowns, which is ridiculous in this context since you can't even qualify your known knowns with a known amount of error.). Basically it boils down to "Don't do it unless you have a really good reason" vs "Do what you want". The only reason you need to consider the first one is if the laws of time-travel change off of the main time-line. Since WOG says they are a constant set of rules that really boils down to "Do what you want". In-universe though, the risk analysis will boil down to "Don't do it unless you have a really good reason" modified by our certainty in how the physics of time-travel works across time-lines. Would it be considered bad to actively or passively create time-lines that are worse for humanity overall than the uninflicted one? Depending on whether you look at it as probability or not we are once again divided on the pervasive thought. As far as actively creating them (versus "passively" as a result of going where you want...) you would probably only actively create time-lines if "existence" was valued highly by your moral function AND/OR the multi-verse was interpreted as "Probabilistic" as a whole. In the scenario where "existence" was was valued high enough by your moral function to lead to creation then the "quality of existence" would probably be inconsequential (although it could easily be factored in). If we're under a probabilistic scenario then it is definitely immoral. We of course know whether it is a probabilistic scenario or not, but in-universe they don't. So they will do as all risk analysis does and assume the worst. As such, creation of sub-par universes on purpose would definitely be seen as the height of immorality (you just slighted an entire universe!) accidental creation of sub-par would be unethical but could be fudge-factored via the "existence" part of the moral function into ethical. Would it be better justified to improve the present by importing knowledge from the future or by changing the past? *Only justified in a probabilistic context and only when risk vs benefit is carefully weighed.* As for a rough risk analysis: the only bad scenario is a "Probabilistic Existence" with a "bad" universe resulting from the travel. As long as the the probability of a "bad" universe is non-zero it is likely to happen at some point if you travel. You can't control universes outside your own. Sadly, N could be growing exponentially and your universe could have absolutely no say in it outside of the possibility of you making the initial choice not to time-travel. If you're not the main universe, you're likely screwed from influencing the relative "good" since you can realistically be expected to only ever be able to affect 100/N percent of the total "good"/"bad" ratio, where N is fixed at whatever it was when you decide to time-travel. This is because, since if you came into existence from time-travel it stands to reason that other time-travel events may have occurred and any time-travel choice you make may be duplicated for each branch in the tree.) If the chance of branches increasing is decently high then the "Probabilistic Existence" devolves into "Certain Existence" because, out of the likely-constantly-increasing choices going on among the branches, you will have almost no determining effect on the outcome. So just like "Certain Existence" this case assigns no moral value to time-travel, "Just do what you want". Building and running a time-machine is unlikely to be easy and cheap, so only already powerful future entities (like governments) can start a time-travel program. Are their motives more likely to be in line with the principles of Temporal Ethics than that of a random rogue individual? Probably they will be ethical. Since it all boils down to risk analysis anyway, which they are certainly going to apply from an economic standpoint at the very least. We can be relieved as outsiders since we can know that their choice is inconsequential anyways. As in-universe people we can be relieved since we know they are going to be more sensible than a rogue mad doctor.
