Like many of your questions, there is a philosophical "groundlessness" that can easily make people "peevish," to use your own words. And a scent of "holier than thou" attempting the pry out "hypocrisy." First, is war ever ethically justified? You cannot even ask your questions without answering this one. The ethical justifications of war are a complex and "all too human" problem. Few attempts are actually made by "idealists" to rationalize war, so it "just happens." In the end, I believe, there can be no "ethical" or universalist justification for war, in either the pacifist tradition or in the Kantian "deontic" tradition. And as such, the purified world of the philosophers and "great spirits" abandons the lowly world of the species that gave rise to them. So first, a Turing Test. Are you a "human" or a pure judgmental entity? Please define first under what circumstances you consider war, with all its horrors, justified. Then perhaps your question can be addressed. But if you are just playing a silly "holier than thou" game of leading responders into "hypocrisy" then you are in the wrong forum. Or, less charitably, you have formed your question with a kind of saintly malice aforethought. I certainly agree that it is a good question on the historical or political level. But somehow your framing discredits it. You are ethically attempting to stand on the sidelines. Give us a case in which "you" are instigating this war. Then your ethical challenges make sense, as they did to the Greeks and other classical philosophers. 

Just a few. For continuous identity, "Ship of Theseus" paradox; for consciousness and identity, Donald Davidson's "Swamp Man Argument;" for scientific perspective on teleporting, Vlatko Vedral "Decoding Reality" and related papers. There is undoubtedly much, much more and there is just as undoubtedly no settled agreement on any of it. 

This is an interesting question, though not very tightly formed. I don't know enough about Dennett to respond on the basis of his assumptions--in other words, he is not a "D-Person" for me. The origin of the word "persona" may help here. It comes from Greek drama, where the voice or "sonic" element is identified by the "mask" or "thing before the voice." The voice of the actor was both amplified by the mask and placed under that identity or "pronoun" indicated by the mask. This was then transferred into the law courts where someone else could speak as the representative of a "person." So the "person" is at least doubly "represented." Always through and in virtue of a "mediating" object, if only words or faces. But if this medium or "mask" is essential to the construction of a "person," we cannot assume all such mediations are equally transparent to "recognition," especially in the moral sense. Dennett, like many raised in the tradition of "rational agency" is insensitive to the problems of "recognition" through media. The social media singles-hunter, internet gamer, and military drone operator may construct a mediated "person" on the other side of the screen. But no meaningful value system is necessarily carried through as "recognition." 

While the answers above should do it, I want to add a note about the assertions of fallacy on the website: "To assume any law, even divine, applies to every person, in every time, in every situation, even though not explicitly stated, is an assumption not grounded in evidence, and fallacious reasoning." Well, maybe. This is a consequentialist view of "law" that for many would explicitly not apply to "divine law." For deontic moralists like Kant, applying the universal law against one's contingent judgment is not necessarily fallacious and the consequentialist approach is not necessarily grounded in evidence. As Kant--no stranger to reasoning--points out, the consequentialist view assumes that one can predict the outcome of one's action beforehand and with perfect, or shall we say, "divine" accuracy. The assumption is that your violation of the divine command will save the person you are hiding and attain the best "moral" outcome overall. This is a purely inductive assumption based, indeed, on a single unique case. Who is to make the determinations of each exceptional case? Given the circumstantial pressures, is the aggregate of such individual exceptions more reliable than the presumably traditional or "divine" law? So while the answers concerning the "accident fallacy" are correct, the assertions on the website can arguably, from a Kantian perspective, be deemed fallacious and "not based in evidence." In less obvious cases, and most cases are not at all obvious, this is not a trivial or merely fundamentalist reply. 

Bergson wrote a small, well-known book on humor, which I have not read. Simon Critchley wrote a book on humor, which I have but can't find at the moment. Zizek is well known for his interest in jokes. Aristotle wrote a lost work on comedy, which figures in "The Name of the Rose." There may be something by Nelson Goodman, and I suspect humor is a likely topic for existentialists, from Kierkegaard to Sartre. (That would, of course, exclude all existentialists who are German, the only nation with no standup comedians and no logical "reason" for them.) I'm not sure where the Hegel material is, probably you are right, in the aesthetics lectures. Hegel was famous, of course, for his incisive one-liners, reckless pranks, and jolly sense of humor. His students couldn't stop laughing. Actually, Hegel was, in a sense, fond of "puns" or words that did double duty, such as Aufhebung. 

The question is perhaps ill-defined. Human "freedom" entails our human ability to observe, record, and reiterate physical-causal laws from which we, as "the observers," become independent. To observe and experimentally control "laws" of psycho-behavioral causation can be seen at the scientific and social levels as "freedom" from those very laws. We assume the higher freedom of "forming" and "altering" human behaviors previously constrained by nature, instinct, or unexamined habit. This conforms to the philosophical maxim: "know thyself." Obviously, this is also a description of "inculturation," and we do it all the time in advertising, education, ideology, albeit less consciously. As "science" such knowledge of behavioral function should be, in theory, public, observable, and accessible to all. As "technology" the moral question becomes whether or not such techniques are used coercively and transparently, and whether or not subjects are treated, in Kant terms, as "means" or as "ends." I do not see that behavioral technologies are necessarily inimical to Kant's "Kingdom of Ends." They produce new powers and possibilities for collective freedom, as well as new powers and possibilities for the suppression of individual freedom or expansion of class domination. The moral question lies elsewhere. It lies in the treatment of individuals as means or as ends, and in the relations of technology to class domination. This is not to mention that any crude appeal to freedom as "authenticity" or "natural right" may already be moot in mass societies of nervous systems integrated through the behavioral "reality" of television. 

I am responding in a general way to your question and subsequent comments. Though I am not sure how well defined "complexity" and "systems theory" really are, one philosopher who may interest you is Nicholas Luhmann. He develops a "systems-based" ontology in which his fundamental terms are System/Environment. He employs this largely in descriptions of social systems, and considered himself a "sociologist" in the broad manner of the Frankfurt School. He is a strict constructivist and his outlook seems to me not unlike Leibniz's monadology. Very interesting. As another reference, the Nobel chemist I. Prigogine and the philosopher I. Stengers have collaborated on a number of books introducing the philosophical ramifications of chaos and complexity theory, most notably "Order Out of Chaos." These may be works that would help you get your bearings. However, you seem to want "apply" complexity theories to philosophy itself. This would not be philosophy per se but perhaps "sociology of philosophy." Philosophy cannot treat itself scientifically because it is "historical." It retains and reinterprets its own history, its internal temporality. It cannot (with apologies to Logical Positivism and the Tractatus) redescribe itself in "timeless" mathematical equations or make "discoveries" that render prior texts useless. There are, of course, many books like Russell's "The Problems of Philosophy" that attempt to lay out "the essential issues." On the other hand, if your aim is to look at the issue of "essence" in terms of "complexity" that may be interesting but is very broad. The reduction of "essence" or "substance" to some form of dynamic multiplicity is a huge theme in philosophy from Heraclitus to Badiou. But I am not sure about your equation of complexity to Aristotelian formal cause or whatever, so here I'll leave off. Not an answer, but helpful I hope.
