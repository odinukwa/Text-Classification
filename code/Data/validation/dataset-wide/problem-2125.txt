It appears that the complaint wasn't so much that the person was on the phone, but that being on the phone in an open area was interfering with someone else's ability to get his or her work done. Having worked with someone who was frequently on personal calls that were so loud that I could not hear business calls that were critical, I can tell you how annoying this can be. It is not discrimination or harrassment to complain that others are interfering with your work. If it is not true, then it still may be a perceptual problem. If the calls were short but there were several of them over a two hour period, from the perspective of the person trying to work, it is essentially a two hour call. Clearly, there is a problem here. Even if the orginal accusation is not true, someone is annoyed enough with your friend to offically complain and his actions will be more closely monitored. Your friend needs to stop making personal calls at work entirely unless away from the work space. And even there, he should probably try not to make more than one or two personal calls a day. Since there was a complaint, his time on the phone will likely be monitored (even though the boss said that he felt the complaint was in error, most bosses will not want a repeat of the complaint and so will be watching to see if there is a problem.) and he will need to make sure that people see that he is not slacking off by spending too much time on personal business. Frankly, unless there is an emergency, it is generally a bad idea to spend any more than 10 minutes per day on personal calls. And most days you should not need to make any personal calls at all. Once you have been accused of something (even unfairly), it is up to you to correct the misperception through your actions. Maybe your friend doesn't think he makes more or longer calls than other people. That is irrelevant however; he needs to be aware that people will from now on always be paying attention to his calls and to make them short and sweet and not in the open space. He may also need to be aware that the volume of the call may be the real problem. Many people talk louder than they think they do. Addtionally open spece is a horrible environment for people who need to do concentrated work, so he needs to be aware that his actions really can be disturbing to other people and he needs to keep things relatively quiet while in the open space. If he has had one accusation, the possibility exists that there will be more if the perceived behavior doesn't change. If someone other than the orginal complainer also has a complaint, then your friend's explanation will be less likely to be believed. Another issue is that accuser didn't feel he could come directly to the person making the phone calls. Generally most people will ask you to go somewhere else if the call is interfering with their work and only go to a manager if the person does not get off the phone. That the person didn't come directly to him can indicate that your friend already have a poor working relationship with at least one of his colleagues. Your friends needs to see about building better relationships with the people he shares space with. At the very least he needs the good will of the others in case this person has decided he doesn't like your friend and is trying to make life miserable for him with offical complaints. He will want people to stick up for him and say that what is being complained about isn't true or management will get the feeling of where there is smoke there must be fire after several complaints. It is always critical to build good working relationships with those you work with and those people you sit near. Someone who is getting workplace complaints can't afford to be unfriendly to co-workers or unhelpful to them or try to pretend they don't exist. I know some people would prefer not to interact with their collaegues but this is a mistake of massive proportions in the workplace and all to often results in people who dislike you taking steps to make sure you are gotten rid of. It is never enough to do your job well, you have to manage the perceptions of your bosses and co-workers as well. 

Personally I would take option number 3. If that doesn't work take number 4. It honestly tells your boss that you are uncomfortable and allows you to get out of expressing a public opinion. If your boss is such a jerk that he still doesn't back off, option 1, while dishonest, is the probably most viable option because he clearly won't stop until you agree with him. Option 2 is the riskiest if this subject is as important to your boss as it appears to be. 

The appropriateness depends on the situtation and the person and how often you do it. Clearly some people are bothered by them and if I knwe someone did not like Post-it notes, I wouldn't put them on his monitor unless I had no other choice. Personally I think a post it should be reserved for a situtation where you need an answer as soon as someone else gets out of a meeting and you don't want it lost in a sea of emails and phone messages. I will leave these for my boss when I know he is going from one meeting to another, so he knows that I need to urgently talk to him as soon as he can spare 5 minutes. I don't leave them for unimportant things or just for information unless the info is something he specifically asked for and I am positive he won't want to search through a bunch of emails to find it. I will usually send an email followup to these types of post-it notes so there is a record of the answer as well. Another time to avoid the Post-it note is when you are the boss and you come in earlier than your reports (or stay later) and leave a lot of new tasks for them to do in the form of post it notes on their monitor. I had a boss like this who left me no less than 6 of these a day. Being faced with a bunch of new tasking before you have even sat down is beyond annoying. I also will leave Post-it notes to myself about something I want to be reminded to do. Things like take the "take the salad home" or "Password changed" when I had to change the password just before going on vacation. Under no circumstances put a password on a Post-it note. 

IF you were working, then you are most likely legally entitled to a lunch break if your local laws require one. However, there is a huge difference between legally entitled to and what the company culture permits. For instance, many companies do Lunch and Learn events and try to pretend that it is your lunch break but it is really a training session that should be considered paid work time not an unpaid lunch time. However, in the company culture, they expect you not to consider it as work time. You can take a real lunch break after but be prepared for lots of push back from your colleagues and your boss especially if you your charge your time to specific projects or clients as taking a lunch break and calling training time work will mess up their percentages of productive time. An actual lunchtime meeting with colleagues from other departments who don't sit by you is easier to get by with taking your real lunch afterwards (or earlier) because no one will notice. Personally I always take a lunch break away from the office and my coworkers are used to that. So no one questions when I do the same after a meeting that happened to be scheduled at lunch. Many of my coworkers work at their desks and eat lunch there or skip lunch entirely. Most of them are the ones who schedule lunchtime meetings. It helps to block your lunch period off on your calendar and then fewer of those meetings will be scheduled. I usually push back on meetings scheduled at lunch unless I know they are something time-critical or the organizer is having trouble scheduling. A big deal meeting with a fancy catered lunch and senior management is usually going to be considered as your lunch break in most companies I have worked for. Nor can you usually ask for those types of meetings to be rescheduled. If the CEO wants a company-wide meeting at noon, then that is what is going to happen. Sometimes, it is in your best interest to just accept that. Luckily these tend to happen relatively rarely. 

First move to a company where there is the possibility of growth. First line managers are most often promoted from within (At least this is as I have observed it) unless they have management experience. To be a manager, you have to be aware of the issues that managers care about and not just code. So at this new job, you want to get a reputation for delivering a good product on time and on budget. (it is generally easier to get promoted if you are good at what you currently do.) You want to ask to make presentations at meetings about your project. Managers have to attend and present at a lot of meetings, the more you do this, the more people will think of you in terms of being a manager and half the battle is won. You want to make suggestions for change and couch them in business terms not just technical terms. So make the case for why you should use technology X or buy technical toy Y by showing how it will reduce manhours, cost less, etc. Managers are concerned with profits and budgets and customer satisfaction and it will help if you tend to talk about those types of things when you suggest changes to how work is done. Even if you don't change jobs before applying for a management position, being able to show how you drove a postive change in your organization will help you get considered. You want to volunteer for special projects especially those that will get you known to higher managers. Ask to be on the hiring panel when hiring new developers. You want to show that you are thinking beyond the code. You want to get company awards for your work. Get known as someone who has domain knowledge of your business not just programming knowledge. If you have the opportunity to talk to users, clients, etc., take it. 

Your company is in the business of selling software. Selling the existing product will alawys take higher priority over adding new features. From the company's perspective, having a developer on site with the customer is a huge selling point and may be the difference between them making enough money to pay your salary and them not. Small companies can't always afford to have strict job definitions and roles, so your role is not just software developer. This is one of the best things about working for a small company, the chance to learn how to do a lot of things. From the perspective of your personal career, one of the biggest weak points most developers have is that they don't userstand the users' needs. This is a priceless opportunity to get client-contact and start to understand what is truly needed. This kind of experience can only make you a better developer when you are no longer inthis this role. You say all this could be done through other means, but there is no substitute for direct personal contact. Emails, IMs, teleconferences are just not the same and the client won't feel the same level of company commitment to them without the personal meetings. All that said, if you don't understand why they need you specifically to travel, you need to have a private conversation with your boss about it. But don;t go in defensively, with an "I hate this and don't want to do it" attitude. Go in and ask exactly what you are expected to accomplish with the visit and then make suggestions from there for alternatives ways to meet the objectives of the visit or alternative people to do the work. But remember, the company's priorities and yours are not the same, they most likely view this as the productive use of your time. It would be up to you to find a convincing argument otherwise and you can't do that until you know exactly why you were chosen to do this and exactly what they expect you to accomplish that can't be accomplished with you staying home. 

You should get a written document from your doctor describing why you need to fly in larger seats and what other accomodations are needed to do your job effectively. Then you should take it to HR and ask them to authorize you to fly first class. Now you have the problem of team resentment. You do not have to disclose to your team other than you havea medical reason why you need to be in the first class seats. If anyone asks for further details, you can say that your medical history is private and refuse to discuss. If you don't discuss the problme though, people will still speculate and wonder if you are gaming the system, especially if you do not appear to have a problem at other times. However, I have noticed that there tends to be less resentment when people are more aware of the problem and why you need an accomodation. If you feel comfortable explaining about your back issues, I would tend to think you should. I would strongly suggest that you include your boss when you contact HR for teh accomodation, so that he can diffuse any problems if peopel seem to be uset that you are getting special treatment. I would also tend to think you should stop sucking it up and trying to do what you should not be doing. If you are consistent about not doing things becasue you havea back problem, then people are more likely to beliwve you have one. If you pick up heavy things at work, then you show your teammates you are not really disabled. If you play on the company sports team, it also looks suspicious. If you want an accommodation, you need people to believe it and doing things that look suspicious doesn't help your case with your co-workers. Nor is sucking it up and doing things out of pride good for your long-term health. Leave the heavy stuff for your healthy co-workers. Make sure to do stretches in front of them and get up from the desk often. It looks funny that you can sit at a desk without moving for hours and can't sit in an airplane seat too. In fact if you shouldn't be sitting for long periods, consider also asking for a standing desk. Besides not doing other physically stessful things that could put you flat on your back for weeks, I would make sure to be known as a good team player as far as the work goes. People are going to resent you less for flying first class if they like you for the way you contribute to the team. Go out of your way to help (except for the heavy lifting!) and you will be given the benefit of the doubt most places and amounfg most people.
