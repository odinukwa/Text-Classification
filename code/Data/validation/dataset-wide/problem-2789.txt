Ayn Rand was a philosopher. She wrote about epistemology in "Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology". She wrote about moral and political philosophy in many books. She wrote a book called "Philosophy: Who Needs It": the title essay of that book argued that everyone needs philosophy. The alternative to having an explicit philosophy is to have load of unexamined ideas you picked up because they happened to appeal to your whims. Rand judged many academic philosophers as bad philosophers. This is not the same as saying philosophy is a bad idea. Rand's criticism of Rawls was not just that she didn't like his conclusions. Rather, her criticism was that she had argued against his conclusion. She also argued against his premises including the original position. See in particular chapter 11 of "Philosophy: Who Needs It": "An Untitled Letter". Now, you say Rand has a particular political point of view. This is true, but she had arguments explaining why she took that position, unlike most politicians. In addition, people who claim to be politically neutral are often in the position of having a load of unrecognised and unargued moral and political positions that shape their actions by giving them vague feelings of righteousness or unease about particular issues and situations. And, as Rand argued, you need philosophy to sort out a mess like that. 

You are assuming that there is a process by which an idea could be shown to be true or probably true: justification. As Popper pointed out in Chapter I of "Realism and the Aim of Science" justification is impossible, unnecessary and undesirable. If you assess ideas using argument then the arguments have premises and rules of inference and the result of the argument may not be true (or probably true) if the premises and rules of inference are false. You might try to solve this by coming up with a new argument that proves the premises and rules of inference but then you have the same problem with those premises and rules of inference. You might say that some stuff is indubitably true (or probably true), and you can use that as a foundation. But that just means you have cut off a possible avenue of intellectual progress since the foundation can't be explained in terms of anything deeper. And in any case there is nothing that can fill that role. Sense experience won't work since you can misinterpret information from your sense organs, e.g. - optical illusions. Sense organs also fail to record lots of stuff that does exist, e.g. - neutrinos. Scientific instruments aren't infallible either since you can make mistakes in setting them up, in interpreting information from them and so on. We don't create knowledge (useful or explanatory information) by showing stuff is true or probably true for reasons so how do we create knowledge? We can only create knowledge by finding mistakes in our current ideas and correcting them piecemeal. You notice a problem with your current ideas, propose solutions, criticise the solutions until only one is left and then find a new problem. We shouldn't say that a theory is false because it hasn't been proven because this applies to all theories. Rather, we should look at what problems it aims to solve and ask whether it solves them. We should look at whether it is compatible with other current knowledge and if not try to figure out the best solution. Should the new idea be discarded or the old idea or can some variant of both solve the problem? A more accurate criticism of the idea of God would point out that it doesn't solve any problems. If God made the laws of morality or science or whatever a particular way for some reason, then any physical mechanism that respects that principle would explain the same phenomenon. For example, if God made organisms to keep their genes in existence, then evolution explains their behaviour better than God. And if God had no reason for making the world behave a particular way then we might as well say "shit happens" rather than go to the trouble of postulating God. So God's existence solves no problems. And since God introduces lots of problems, like the problem of evil, the idea should be ditched. Your friend claims that he feels God in his heart. Harry Potter fans may feel good when they think about him, but they don't feel the need to say he really exists. You friend should not need to postulate the existence of God to explain his warm and fuzzy feelings. And whatever your friend likes about the God story, he can still like it after ditching belief in God, provided there is no argument against liking it. You ask if science is better than personal belief. It is better to have the idea that all of your ideas should be open to question. On issues where ideas can be experimentally tested, it is better to want to do the tests, so you can eliminate bad ideas. But there are issues where such tests are not possible, such as the question "Should ideas be experimentally tested where possible?" That issue can't be decided by an experimental test because any such test would presuppose that you ought to do the test. So there are issues that science can't resolve and some other way is needed to decide them. If the issue is "should I eat some ice cream?", then your personal preference that you should eat some ice cream would be more relevant than scientific knowledge about how to make ice cream. 

The quantum mechanical worlds obey some restrictions, as you have noted. Universes are structures within the multiverse within which information can flow: $URL$ There is a version of me sitting one centimetre to my right, but he can't interact with me directly and he also can't convey information to me indirectly by typing something on the keyboard that is different from what I am typing now. The reason is that I can't interact with the version of the keyboard on which he is typing, nor can he interact with my version of the keyboard. Me and my version of the keyboard is in one universe "one centimetre to the right" me and his version of the keyboard is in another universe. The quantities that carry information that can be copied are described by Heisenberg picture observables: Hermitian operators. No quantity that is described by something other than such an observable can be realised in any quantum mechanical world: $URL$ 

Oen position advocated by many people is the position advocated by Peter Singer. Once you have enough to live comfortably you should give the rest away, or the government should force you to do so. There are many problems with this idea if it is taken seriously on its own terms. Who should receive the income you give away? Poor people in other countries are often poor because their government are corrupt or tyrannical or both, e.g. - North Korea and Syria. So if you give money to somebody in those countries the government may just steal it and kill him. And even if they don't, such countries lack rational institutions that allow bad policies or people to be removed from power such as free markets or liberal democracy so the money may just be wasted. Objectivists would advocate another position, see "The Virtue of Selfishness" by Ayn Rand, especially "The ethics of emergencies". Rand would point out that you don't owe another person anything except as a result of deals you enter into voluntarily. The alternative is to require that a person must act against his judgement about who should receive his money. This undermines rational argument about what a person should do with his resources. You might sometimes give a person money if he is having a bad time, but you should use your own judgement and should expect to gain by giving him money. The mere existence of suffering doesn't mean you should give away anything. Positions in between those two extremes are bound to lose over time against anybody who is more consistent. Once you have conceded that some particular standard is correct, resisting progress toward that standard is contemptible by your own moral standards. I think Rand is right on this issue and that the alternative is openly anti-rational and anti-human. 

You asked how the following examples of observation could be interpreted as theory laden: (1) All objects fall to the ground. (2) Ice melts in the sun. (3) All people die eventually. Observation (1) is false. There are lots of objects that will never fall to the ground because they achieved escape velocity. But let's consider an object that does in fact fall to the ground. You have to identify the object in question as being the same object over time. There are some physical systems that don't have identity over time. For example, if two electrons interact there is in general no fact of the matter about which electron after the interaction corresponds to which electron after the interaction. You have to understand the idea of a non-zero distance between two objects. You have to measure that distance in some way, and there are some ways you could do that which would be wrong, e.g. - if the ground and the object overlap in your field of view they may not be in contact. (2) could also be false. You might have the ice in a transparent freezer. But in the case where it does melt your observations still involve theory. It assumes that there is such a thing as ice and that different ice samples are made of the same stuff as other ice samples. Then you have to understand the idea that ice and the water it melts into are the same substance. And again, you need to have some way of determining that the ice has changed phase and that requires some explanation of you make that determination. (3) may also be false. The human body is a biological machine. There is no reason to think it is impossible to maintain the body indefinitely with the right technology. But in any case. In order to identify the person who was alive at one time with the person who died at some later time, you must have the idea of identity of a person over time. You must also have a way of checking that the dead person and formerly alive person are the same person, which can be difficult. See "Logic of Scientific Discovery" by Popper especially Chapter 5, and "The Beginning of Infinity", by David Deutsch Chapters 1,2 and 10.
