I think the latter can be directly rebutted. Atheists could have an externally-delivered "fixed moral center" from a source other than a religious text, for instance: 

No, he's saying that because he describes himself in everyday language as not believing in the Olympian Gods, and because (he says) his disbelief in those Gods is of a kind with his disbelief in the Christian God and every hypothetical God, that he should also describe himself in everyday language as an atheist. He's not describing anyone who disbelieves in the Olympian Gods and believes in the Christian God, and he's not saying that just because a person disbelieves in the Olympian Gods then they should be an atheist. 

The argument you want to rebut seems to come in two parts, the second of which doesn't get much attention from your idealised religious person: 

The religious person might argue that "what your mama told you" might be morally incorrect, and therefore is not a moral center. For example, for all we know maybe she approved of stealing. But functionally as long as it's consistent it will serve as a source of moral imperatives, and so if the religious person argues this then they have been disingenuous. They are not really arguing that ethics is impossible without a religious text, they're arguing that true ethics is impossible without their religious text, the one they hold to be correct. Simply put two such religious people, of different religions or different doctrinal inclinations, in a room together, and leave them to rebut each others' arguments. The former claim, "morality requires a fixed moral center" might ultimately boil down to a particular definition of morality. It does seem reasonable that ethics must progress from some set of imperatives, but it might be that the words "fixed" and "center" are being imbued by the religious person with some sacred aura that a non-religious imperative can't, in their mind, compete with. If the religious person ultimately is defining morality to mean, "following the commandments of a religion" then logically speaking they're absolutely correct, atheists aren't moral, but you can get into their axioms with them in order to establish that they're begging the question. None of this is deep philosophy, but when the argument we're supposed to be rebutting contains the statement, "[atheists could] justify killing other humans on the basis of their actions or beliefs", as if this is something only enabled by their atheism, when in fact we observe many religious people who support war and/or the death penalty, then I don't think the philosophical big guns are really required. The argument you're presenting to be rebutted is pretty weak, and an expert could present a stronger version :-) 

The disconnect between Atheists and Theists largely stems from using very different semantical contexts to really describe the same perspective. Especially the difference between Atheism and Animistic Pantheism is purely semantic. If we were to adjust our semantics more to each other, many of us might see more similarities than they ever held possible. The so-called New Atheism movement lacks any significant knowledge of religion beyond Judeo-Christianity and therefore fails to appreciate the mere semantic difference between Atheism and Animistic Pantheism. It fails to truly comprehend why the belief in Gods is so popular and how the perception of natural phenomena relates to the perception of supposedly supernatural phenomena. Additionally, the New Atheism movement doesn't contribute any new ideas of significance to Atheism, making it mostly an anti-movement (focused on countering Christians and Christian rationale in American culture). 

So, here we see that cultural biases clearly play a role in whether we consider ourselves or others Atheistic, as whichever definition people use for "God" is typically dependent on cultural biases. In the case of Hitchens, it's his Judeo-Christian background. Whether we consider someone Atheistic or not in turn plays a role in whether we characterize that person as religious. And this, in turn, determines our perspective on the compatibility between science and religion. 

It remains unclear what Aquinas is specifically referring to as the first principle of the will. It seems that there are two options that Aquinas himself specifies elsewhere (ST I-II, q.26, a.4): 

The following simplified definitions are provided: 1.) Love of Friendship: Love of a thing for its own sake 2.) Love of Concupiscence: Love of a thing for the sake of another thing So the question is, does Aquinas identify the sort of self-love he deems to be the first principle of all human action as a love of friendship or a love of concupiscence? Put in another way, is the first principle of human action a love of ourselves or a love of that which is good for ourselves? It seems to me that a paradox arises: We only love that which is good for us if we love ourselves, but we only love ourselves if doing so is good for us to do. How would Aquinas reply to all of this? 

Aquinas states in the Summa Theologiae, First Part of the Second Part, Question 1, Article 5 the following: 

The lack of any real progress and the reasons for that are best expressed by University of Texas at Austin philosophy professor Louis Mackey in the following quote: 

See also my article The Atheistic approach to God… or how to bridge the gap between Atheists and Theists, where I explain (1) why "Atheism vs Theism" is a false dichotomy and (2) how the artificial gap between Atheism and Theism can be bridged. 

As I explain in The Atheistic approach to God… or how to bridge the gap between Atheists and Theists, the distinction between Theists & Atheists is a false dichotomy. If we look at Pantheism, Shamanism, Animism and their many variations, the line between Atheism & Theism becomes blurry. The deeper you get into these perspectives, the more the distinction between Atheism & Theism seems arbitrary and mostly semantic. It my experience, you'll find that many - if not most - scientists are somewhere in the grey zone between Theism & Atheism, believing in "something" but not calling it "God" because they can't relate their - often Jewish or Christian - notion of "God" with that "something" they do believe in. Even Christopher Hitchens, known for his explicitly anti-Theist views, expressed a belief in what he referred to as "the Numinous" and an appreciation of religion in how it cultivates "the Numinous" : 

To add more context, this quotation is his response to the situation he's chosen to consider in this section of his essay. "Whenever I go into a foreign country or a prison or any similar place they always ask me what is my religion". The difficulty here is not about his beliefs, it's about how he can accurately answer that question when posed by some official or other. So, he's not changing his beliefs, he's changing the label he uses when describing his beliefs to different audiences. Russell assumes that to a philosophical audience the word "atheist" means "a person whose beliefs entail the non-existence of God", whereas "agnostic" means "a person who thinks there is no conclusive argument for or against the existence of God" (he explicitly states here that he thinks there is no conclusive argument against God. He has let it go without saying that he thinks there's no conclusive argument for God either). Therefore, to a philosophical audience he uses the word "agnostic" to describe his beliefs. He can't present a proof of God's non-existence from his own priors, which is what a "pure philosophical audience" would understand by the word "atheist". Then, Russell assumes that to the ordinary man in the street, "atheist" means "a person who does not believe in God". By this definition, Russell is an atheist, since "God exists" is not among his beliefs. Basically he's advocating talking to people in their own language rather than getting too hung up on the proper philosophical definitions at all times. Therefore that there's no contradiction in describing himself as an agnostic in one context and an atheist in another. In particular he sees no contradiction in publicly describing himself as an atheist and nevertheless believing that one cannot prove the non-existence of God. By raising the Olympian Gods as an example I think he is also teasing those who want to draw what he believes to be an overly-pedantic distinction between agnosticism and atheism. He asserts (rightly or wrongly) that there are many things other than the Christian God in which we don't believe, and which if absolutely pressed we would acknowledge can't be disproved either, but we don't go around in everyday life saying that we're agnostic on the subject. 

I'm not sure you can, because - whether driven by religion or ideology - most people are not even capable of developing a worldview not guided by whatever faith they've developed during their upbringing : 

It is commonly understood that free will is an illusion, because the universe we live in behaves in a deterministic fashion and our brains / minds are no exception... regardless of intelligence! Here's two contemporary approaches to the nature of free will in a deterministic system : 

"God" could be considered equivalent to "nature", depending on your definition of "God". Especially the Pantheistic / Animistic concept of "God" could be considered indistinguishable from the Atheistic / naturalistic concept of "nature" beyond the level of mere semantics. I elaborate on this in my article The Atheistic approach to God… or how to bridge the gap between Atheists and Theists. 

Faith is typically a subconscious process, that works through emotion. It is typically driven by processes at the instinctive or intuitive level that one is not consciously aware of. Reason is a conscious process, that may or may not take emotions into account (albeit at a conscious level). While some argue that faith and reason are complementary, they are nevertheless very distinct phenomena and they should not be confused. Either way, the (correct & consistent) application of reason does not require any faith whatsoever and has consistently been proven to be far more reliable than any degree of faith! Some, including myself, would go as far as arguing that reason eliminates the need for faith : 

The proof must have been carried out in some kind of formal system, otherwise it's not so much a proof as a persuasive argument. So, we have a proof in some system of the statement 1 + 1 != 2. Philosophers in the subject of logic, and mathematicians, would look closely at the details of this proof. Since all formal systems that anyone is interested in prove the opposite of this statement, also proving this statement demonstrates that whatever system was used, is inconsistent. So that system could no longer be used for serious work. Therefore, logicians would have learned something extremely important about that particular logical system, and they would want to know what other systems the same technique will prove inconsistent. The universe could not be "thrown into chaos" unless one believes in some kind of (dare I say it: magical?) effect by which the motion of stars in the Andromeda galaxy is significantly affected by what markings you make on a piece of paper on Earth. A solipsist might, I suppose, believe that the universe is sustained solely by their personal belief in logical consistency, and hence that the universe would be fundamentally altered by their reading this proof. Most people have enough faith in the existence of an external reality, not to believe that the universe has any interest in what proofs humans do or do not produce. I expect that philosophers not interested in logic and formal proof systems would mostly ignore the result, at least until the logicians explained to them exactly under what conditions they (the non-logicians) are actually using the same flawed system that proves 1 + 1 != 2, and therefore what reasoning it is they need to stop using. Of course it also depends to an extent on what you mean by disproving that 1 + 1 = 2. One might imagine a "physical proof" rather than a formal logical one. If you mean that someone has proven that they can place one orange in an empty bowl, and then place another orange in the same bowl, and no other oranges have been added or removed, and that the bowl now contains some number of oranges other than 2, you might say they've proved 1 + 1 != 2. But everyone's expectation is that actually, some kind of previously-unknown physical process involving oranges is involved. So while you've discovered something that really changes our notions of the nature of reality, that's not because of the "most fundamental equation" being logically wrong, it's because oranges (or physical objects in general) apparently don't obey arithmetic any more, and therefore the equation is no longer applicable to them. Naturally, this would be extremely troubling, because humans rely all the time on being able to count things, and so human society might well be throw into chaos. 

You cannot answer the question whether there is room for a "God" in the existentialist worldview or many other worldviews, if you do not first define what "God" is. Most people tend to skip that step, yet this step is IMO the most essential step in any argument. Once you restrict your definition of "God" to a definition that is fully compatible with Atheism, the issue becomes trivial and the answer is an obvious "yes". And yes, you can actually define "God" in a way that is fully compatible with Atheism. Atheism and Animistic Pantheism as equally valid descriptions of reality, different from one another only at the superficial level of semantics. As such, Atheism and Animistic Pantheism can be used interchangeably and should be treated as the same. Concepts of divinity that are not Animistic are fundamentally flawed and don't belong in any rational worldview, existentialist or not. An Atheistic perspective on Consciousness We know from evolutionary biology that multi-celled organisms evolved from single-celled organisms. It is unclear to what degree single-celled organisms gave up their autonomy to be able to act as a single organism and it is reasonable to suggest that our individual cells have maintained some degree of autonomy (consciousness) that we are totally unaware of. A lot of human behavior is associated with subconscious processes in the prefrontal cortex that psycho-analysts refer to as the super-ego. This super-ego reflects the internalization of cultural rules in the form of memes. Such memes often influence human behavior in ways individuals barely realize and can be considered a form of collective consciousness. A group of humans that is connected by means of memes can act as a single conscious organism, much like a cell of our body can act as a single conscious organism. This and many other factoids directly imply that consciousness is not so much a product of our brains but rather a product of complexity and connectivity. From that perspective, the concept of consciousness can both be reduced to the molecular level and expanded to the universe as a whole, with the universe as a very complex holographic quantum computer The relationship with Animism In Hinduism, death is understood as the collapse of the Ātman (individual consciousness) and its dissolution into many different other components that make up the Brahman (universal consciousness). If you look consider the Trimurti (the Hindu triniti), one can clearly see them as anthropomorphic representations of nature (Vishnu) and its two fundamental opposite forces: emergence (Brahma) and entropy (Vishnu). Similarly, many other Devas (Gods) are mere anthropomorphic representations of lesser natural phenomena. The same applies to the Kami of Shinto religion or equivalents in other "polytheistic" religions. One could easily argue that all "polytheistic" religions are really Animistic religions, which are perfectly compatible with the Atheistic framework depending on how one defines concepts like "Consciousness" or "Soul". Pantheism and Shamanism as forms of Animism Pantheism is a simplified version of animism, which removes all "Gods" from the picture except Vishnu (nature). Advaita Vedanta is a form of Hinduism that belongs to this category. Many other religions (eg. Germanic paganism) have a Pantheistic variation, although these advanced forms of religion are rarely known beyond a small esoteric circle of initiates. The Traditionalist School is a school of philosophers from the early 20th century that attempted to explore these esoteric religions and discover a perennial philosophy running throughout all religions. Like Animism, Pantheism is also perfectly compatible with Atheism, again depending on how one defines concepts like "Consciousness" or "Soul". Shamanism is a variation of animism that involves the notion that the chemical modification of one's consciousness provides access to higher knowledge that is otherwise filtered from our perception. Shamanic practices do not require a belief in any "Gods" and are not uncommon among Atheist intellectuals, especially since the popularization of LSD and Mescaline in the '60s. Aldous Huxley, Ernst Jünger, Alexander Shulgin, Timothy Leary  and Terence McKenna are among the more prominent shamans in Western culture, although not all of them would use the term "shamanism" in reference to their chemically induced self-exploratory consciousness expanding sessions. The Pantheistic "God" concept from the Atheist's perspective The Atheistic naturalistic position of the universe as a very complex quantum computer is pretty much the same as the Pantheistic position of the universe as one highly advanced mind. The differences between Atheist naturalism and Pantheism are really more a matter of different semantics and different cultural bias than a difference in concept. If one considers the notion that the clock ticks of a computer and awareness are basicly of the same nature (which is a perfectly reasonable consideration), the following statements would mean the exact same thing : 

For Aquinas, the will must originate in a first cause that is not deliberately chosen, for the same reason that reason must originate in a first principle that is not demonstrated. Otherwise we have ourselves an infinite regress. While this much is obvious, things become murky later on when Aquinas identifies this first principle of the will (ST 1, q. 60, a. 3): 

According to pragmatists, in ages of yesteryear the philosophical project aimed at determining the ultimate foundation of knowledge. Interspersed throughout history have been reactions to this foundationalism. Kant, under most pragmatic interpretations, is perhaps the first dude to suggest that the only grounding for all of our knowledge is something internal and something that we contribute: the synthetic a priori. Wittgenstein would later attack the degree of contribution mere tautologies make in our system of knowledge, and Quine would later attack the analyticity espoused by the analytical school at the time, reminding us that none of our knowledge is free from being conditioned by experience. We've wound up with a sort of revisionary, whatever works theory of knowledge. I'm in a quandary: does pragmatism/anti-realism/idealism (whatever you want to call it) really defeat necessity or does it place it elsewhere, say, in the will? Seems to me that rather than really get rid of foundationalism pragmatism says the foundation is what we choose (deliberately or otherwise) to do. At best, it gets rid of one kind of foundationalism. What's my point you ask? My point is this: other foundationalisms have as their support the promise of contrast. There is room for interpretation, for meaningful moves, for doubt and revision, because our foundation is in some way received and interactive with less knowable or less known things received. There is allowed a gap between knower and known. We might even give our own muster to the whole thing (plenty of realisms have recognized this), but the main direction in which human knowledge flows is inward. For the pragmatist, we just give. And in just giving, everything becomes necessary. The only sense of revision is the literal, surface level shifting of beliefs. This seems problematic to me. Here's a little paradox to get after what I'm trying to say in a lot of words: To revise our theories requires in some sense a deficiency in our theories. And to sense a deficiency requires a sense of what should be but is not. My question is after something internal: assuming that we both submit to some given theories and submit to the knowledge that these theories are deficient, what knowledge do we choose to favor and what do we choose to revise? Both knowledges are and have had a history of our submission. Judging solely by the power of our will we are left without a substantive and helpful criterion. One way out of the paradox is allowing some transcendental influence of an independent reality on the person (of the sort Kant might have proposed). But, here comes in my other question. Pragmatists stress the autonomy of the rational will. It distinguishes itself from realisms on the basis that it doesn't allow a conceptual force to the 'given'. Yet, in what other way can mind-independent reality interact or influence the autonomous rational will?
