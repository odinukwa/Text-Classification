The UK legislator with primary responsibility for energy has claimed that exhausted fracked natural-gas wells will be suitable for re-use as a geothermal energy supply (not necessarily geothermal for electricity production, but rather for heat distribution, so let's say 80° - 250°C). Is there much of a co-location of the geo-thermal resource in the UK, with the more easily obtained frackable natural gas; and would an exhausted fracked well be structurally suitable for this? 

Is it possible for there to be enough change such that climate change can reduce and soon come to a stable level? Yes, sort of. For some value of "soon". Of all the emissions released to date, it will take another thirty years for the first stage of impacts to make itself felt. So even if we went to net zero emissions tomorrow, we've got decades of seeing the first stage of impacts, and then centuries of seeing further consequences. (of course, the global climate will continue to change at the scale of tens of thousands of years, but I've understood your question to refer to human impacts, and human lifetimes) But we're not close to getting to net zero emissions. We may be close to the time when emissions stop rising. Then they've got to level off, and then fall to zero. And then probably we'll want them to be deeply negative for a while, to prevent further damage. So we have decades of future climate change already built into the system. And the longer we take to get to net zero emissions, the longer it will be before things stabilise at human timescales. And the higher the cumulative emissions before we reach peak atmospheric CO2 concentrations, the worse the consequences for humankind. If the political will was there, we could probably get to net negative emissions within 20 years. So, we could get to some kind of stability in, say 40-50 years. 

You need to define what you mean by 'adding more sun'. I'm asuming you mean 'increase the solar constant'. The amount of water vapour in the air is, as a first order approximation, related to temperature - every degree of temperature rise gives us 7% more water vapour. So if 'adding more sun' increases the temperature then it automatically increases water vapour. Now, to add more sun without increasing the temperature, you'd have to compensate by doing something like painting large areas of land white; this would increase the Earth's albedo, reflecting the extra solar radiation. No temperature change overall, so no water vapor change. The only direct effect of the sun on water vapor is something entirely different - through photo-dissociation. This is where the sun's UV rays directly break up water molecules. However, in order to have an appreciable effect on the day to day concentration of water vapour, you'd need to replace the Sun with a much bigger and hotter star that blasted out far more UV radiation. The problem here is that everyone would die. So as far as the question can be answered, it would be no under any realistic scenario. 

Quick and simple answer: A greater greenhouse effect. There is an equilibrium in place. CO2 weathering rates depend on temperature, so at lower temperatures, we see CO2 levels rise, warming the planet. At higher temperatures, higher weathering rates mean more CO 2 drawdown, so the planet cools. This is a very long term process. But this CO2 thermometer effect is believed to be the reason why we have had liquid oceans for all of known earth history. As far as the black body effect goes; this is correct - from the viewpoint of an observer at distance, Earth would 'appear' colder. However, this is because the emission height changes (see $URL$ ) for more of an explanation. Think of it as 'the height at which the atmosphere becomes IR-opaque' (although this is a simplification); the temperature then follows the lapse rate down to the ground. So raising the emission height raises the surface temperature. (NB late at night, add refs later..) 

The difference is that a carbon sink accumulates carbon, whereas a carbon reservoir has accumulated carbon. That is to say: A carbon sink is an ongoing process which is increasing the amount of carbon stored in it. Whereas although a carbon reservoir might exchange individual carbon-based molecules with other parts of the carbon cycle, as much will go out as goes in, keeping the amount of carbon in the reservoir broadly constant. Both of these contrast with things such as coal seams and natural gas & crude oil reservoirs that humans have tapped as sources of fuel; and leakages of methane from the ground: these were carbon reservoirs until the amount of carbon in them began depleting (e.g. through mining, well-drilling, or - in the case of methane clathrate leakages - ice melt), at which point they became carbon sources. 

A model is a simplified representation of a system. Rather than try to model everything down to the microscopic level, or as vectors, we often aggregate phenomena across geographic areas, to simplify the computation a lot, and to lose only a little accuracy and precision. So if I want to model the UK, which roughly spans 8°W - 2°E, 50°N - 60°N, that's an area of 10° x 10°. I can split that up into 400 cells, each 0.5°x0.5°. So, starting in the south-west corner, I model the area 8°W-7.5°W x 50°N-50.5°N as a single homogenous area, with no variation within it. And the same for the other 399 cells (8°W-7.5°W x 50.5°N-51°N and so on all the way through to 1.5°E-2°E x 59.5°N-60°N). That would be a 0.5° grid. Note that the gridcells do not overlap at all, and they completely cover the area of interest. (in mathematical terms, they are exclusive and exhaustive - every point of interest is in exactly one gridcell). That can create vast amounts of data - particularly if I'm doing this for the whole world, at second-by-second resolution for ten years, for a few hundred variables of interest. And no one will ever need that amount of precision from my results. So I aggregate up to a more coarse grid: so that I take 25 grid squares that form a larger square, and aggregate each of my statistics of interest in them. So now my area 8°W-7.5°W x 50°N-50.5°N is just one of 25 cells in a square in the coarser grid which spans 8°W-5.5°W x 50°N-52.5°N, and I report statistics for 16 cells in a 2.5° grid, rather than 400 cells in a 0.5° grid. Exactly how that aggregation is done, will vary for each statistic: 

Well, one way would be to look through The rock forming minerals and see how many are represented. I strongly suspect that not all would be, so from that perspective the answer would be No. But from an inspection perspective.. For any given mineral structure, we can make changes by simply substituting various cations and anions as in pyroxene; for example, we can substitute Mg(2+) for Fe(2+). Or SiO4(4-) for AlO4(5-) - requiring other changes. So, assuming you had suitable equipment, you could find a naturally occurring crystal that was close to the desired symmetry group and tweak it with substitutions until it matched that group. Or more simply, adjust the pressure and temperature until the symmetry changed. There is a lot of phase space to explore. So from that perspective, the answer would be probably yes, we just haven't synthesized them all yet. 

What you have probably seen in the movies, as used by the oil and gas industry is reflection seismology. This is where you shoot off a sound source (explosives, airguns, etc) and track the reflections of the sound waves from the various rock layers below the surface. At a smaller scale, there is Ground Penetrating Radar, good for a few 10s of meters at best, which is higher resolution and good for detecting voids. 

I think that in faults in general the fault plane is inclined to the horizontal, and the hanging wall is the mass of rocks above the fault plane, i.e., the side at which the angle between the fault plane and the horizontal is larger, and the foot wall is the mass of rocks below the fault plane, i.e., the side at which the angle between the fault plane and the horizontal is smaller. In the second figure, we have a hanging wall on the left side and we have a foot wall on the right side, and it seems that the hanging wall is moving down relative to the foot wall, and that's what happens in normal faults not reverse ones, right? So why we consider the thrust fault in figure one as a reverse fault? 

Laccolith, lobolith and batholith are shapes of igneous rocks which exist below the surface of the earth, dikes and sills too. And the way they formed by makes me think that they have a porphyritic texture, is that right? Or they have a coarse-grained texture? Because they have crystalled below the earth surface anyway? 

I know this might be a stupid question, but I really want to understand. Since thrust faults are reverse faults why in the figure above if we turned the photo 90 degrees clockwise like this 

All models are wrong. That's important. All models are wrong. In any real-world system that we're interested in, the only accurate model of the system, is the system itself. Anything else, any simplification, gives wrong answers. Some models are useful. That's important, too. Some models help us structure our discussions of the uncertainties (H/T Prof Neil Strachan) Some models allow us to test "what if" scenarios, and look at what the relative changes might be. Now, in the real world, exogenous influences that the model can't account for, would mean that the actual outcomes would be different: but if the model gives a near-enough account of the scale of relative changes, we can still make informed judgements on the basis of the models. Even when it involves pesky things such as turbulence. Some models give us insights into emergent properties of systems: a lot of the really interesting problems are emergent properties that aren't necessarily obvious from just looking at the basic rules of the system, and any insights we can gain are valuable. Some models allow us to do experiments on systems that we couldn't possibly experiment on. And although we know the models are wrong, they can at least give us an indication of the range of possible outcomes. That's not to defend the use of bad models to do bad work. There's far too much of that in my field, and I do not like it. As Simon W says, it is possible to test models to see if they are suitable for a particular purpose. To continue using a model for a purpose where it is known to be inapplicable, is charlatanry, not academia. 

If hydrocarbons were primordial, then we would expect to find them mostly in areas where the mantle or mantle taps reach the surface - mid ocean ridges, and ocean island volcanoes. We don't. The major oil fields are located in continental extensional basin settings. There is plenty of evidence for mantle outgassing - including all volatile species such as hydrocarbons - in the first few hundred million years. Furthermore, on geological timescales the mantle is still undergoing vigorous convection and can be considered liquid. Is irrelevant. This is simply wrong, if referring to pores that can offer any support against pressure. The crust becomes ductile at about 10-15km, and the mantle at 60+km, meaning that conventional porosity cannot exist. See (1). For the Earth, outgassing was essentially completed billions of years ago, as we can see from isotopic evidence (and I suspect that the moon-forming impact didn't help). 

Let's look at this. A very large number of points for one question. First, the solar system. We do not see any hydrocarbons in the inner solar system (Mercury to Mars). This is because in this region of the solar system, dissociation by solar UV rapidly destroys primordial hydrocarbons. This effect is much weaker further out. Oil well 'replenishment' will happen to some degree over several decades, just from internal migration of oil. Typically only a certain percentage of oil in place is recovered, with the rest left in isolated pockets by the water flood. Give it a few decades and these oil pockets will tend to remigrate and link up, giving the appearance of replenishment. I'm not sure what you comment of The source of methane way too deep to come from fossils. No fossils involved.. That's an unreferenced assertion. Helium is present in Natural Gas as a result of accumulation of alpha-decay particles from radioactive isotopes; we can see this from the massive enrichment of Helium-4 over Helium-3. It's not a paradox; geological structures that can trap methane will also trap helium. The current theory behind petroleum geology is that source rocks with a high organic content (often containing biological hydrocarbons from algae and leaf waxes) are buried in sedimentary basins; at temperatures around 100-150 degrees C this kerogen breaks down to form crude oils (this is verified in the lab). Oil then migrates out of this source rock; if it encounters a trapping geological structure, which need not be sedimentary, then it accumulates as an oil deposit. Gas is similar, with a wider range of source rocks. The physics of how this happens are well known and established. I would also note that we don't see hydrocarbons coming out of mantle-derived volcanoes such as at Hawaii. This is a major problem for any theory of primordial hydrocarbons.
