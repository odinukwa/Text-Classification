Separate answer - I use a 20" folding bike as a tractor to pull around a trailer. When the trailer is loaded, the bike has a lot of weight to get up to speed and then to slow back down. Starting from stopped on the big ring even in 32 on the back is very hard work. The bike in question has a triple on front with 48/38/28 teeth, and the rear is 11-34 8 speed cassette. Combined with 20" wheels, gives this bike an ultra low gearing of 15.4 gear-inches. You can play around with combinations at $URL$ 

Chain line is important - the timing chain is often a 1/8th inch chain because it doesn't need any side flex. The rear chain is often a normal 3/32" bicycle chain so it can be used with a derailleur. You could use either (or even a drive belt!) To line up the chainrings, I'd use a long steel ruler, and try to use a matched pair of chainrings and bottom bracket axles. 

The effect is exaggerated because camera is on handlebars, but even at head height I didn't see her till the camera did. You can see my body position by the shadow on the left side. Its New Zealand so we go on the left side of the road, and that's a "marked cycle lane" The road there is a three lane each way, with a posted speed limit of 50 km/h. However its 0830 traffic. I was doing "low 30s" according to strava. So had I been on a flat bar my head would have been 10cm (4 inches) higher. Whether the obstacle looked anyway, I don't know. Downside from being on a MTB or hybrid, your handlebars are much wider, so it far easier to whack a side mirror or a stanchion/bollard or even another cyclist. Also, you're slower on an upright than a road bike. 

I have a road triple with a 28 tooth maximum. The main limiting factor is where the top jockey wheel sits when over the center-most cog. On my folding bike I overdid it with a 34 tooth gear, and the top jockey wheel does not clear the big cog. Upshot is that it works fine, with the jockey wheel pressing slightly into the edge of the cog under spring pressure. Downside is when I shift up (to a smaller cog) its totally possible for the jockey wheel to be hooked on the wrong side of the cog, and you're stuck in the lowest gear until manual intervention. The fix is to increase the B screw tension, to hold the derailleur down further, but that will reduce the tooth engagement on the smaller cogs, increasing wear. 

Opinion answer - maximum of 8 mm of slack/displacement when you push the top of the timing chain down. Ideally 4 mm would be better. On the other extreme, if its rock hard then its too tight, and will accelerate wear on timing chainrings and the chain itself. If you replace the timing chain, get 1/8 inch chain, not 3/32 inch chain. There are no sideways forces, and the timing chainrings are intended for wider chain. 

It looks like a moderately modern road bike that has been refitted with MTB flat bars to make it a rigid hybrid commuter. Modern threadless steerer and a cartridge BB suggests its within the last decade or so. As for value - if you needed a bike and could afford it out of pocket, then you're doing fine financially. Now just ride it and enjoy not paying for operating costs of a motor vehicle, or per-ride costs of public transport. 

Vise Grips or a Pair of Stiltsons, aka a pipe wrench. Leverage is your friend, but watch the slip-zone should something give way. Cold chisel works well on larger diameter things, but small nuts not so much. I'd not bother with this. The shock of hammering may upset your bearing cones and cups inside the hub and even the headset takes abuse. If you have one, try cracking the nut in two with a nut splitter Finally you can get a small 3" or 4" grinder with a cut-off wheel and thin down the nut. The danger here is slipping and damaging the axle, or the wheel hub, or yourself. Plus there's hot spitty sparks which can set fire to lubes and oils and cloths and anything. A dremel tool with a 1" cutoff wheel might work, but the wheels tend to shatter quickly which is also expensive. If you can't cut the nut off, then consider cutting the whole axle off. The nuts pictured above would work well because the flange is a good guide of where to cut. Once the top part of the nut is off, the flange may slide right off at best, or its only got a couple of threads to undo and you have more leverage. A new axle is absolutely needed because it will be too short, and will have overheated changing its hardness. 

Emergency This is an Ass-Saver (tm) (etc) There are many emergency guards, but this one has the cheesy name. They clip into the saddle rails and jutt out the back. That's all. They're short but on a road bike that's okay. Downside is that they're so far from the wheel that roadspray still flies up and hits me in the back of the thighs anyway. These also do nothing to protect the bike or the components of brakes or transmission. For a tenner they're overpriced. 

Punctures are a part of cycling - you'll never eliminate them completely. You get a puncture because something has pierced your innertube. That might be loose objects on the roadway (glass, wire, nails) or the roadway itself (sharp pothole edges) or even your own bike's wheel rims. There are two avenues to minimisation. 1. PREVENTION Look at your tyre - is it worn down in the middle? Most tyres work fine with no tread pattern, but if your main tread is thin then it offers reduced protection. Consider buying new tyres. If you're in the market for tyres anyway, look at those offering Kevlar/aramid breakers or belts. Often marketed as commuter tyres, they have an extra layer of armour under the tread to reduce penetration. Note they offer no protection on the sidewalls (but sidewall punctures are rare) They're also thought to have higher rolling resistance. Schwalbe Marathon Plus would be one brand, but there are many others. You can get similar protection without replacing the tyre by adding tyre liners. These are plastic shells that fit inside the tyre and shield the tube all the way around the wheel. Downside is added weight. Sealant can also prevent punctures. Originally from the tubeless tyre, a bit of liquid latex inside your tube can help seal small holes. Downside this stuff only lasts about 6 months before it needs topping up, so you need a tube valve with a removeable core. 2. AVOIDANCE Think about where you ride - main roads are fast and direct but the high traffic levels tend to sweep the road with air gusts, pushing detritus into the sides of the road. If you ride through these areas you're much more likely to run across small sharp objects. So change your route to avoid these dirty areas. Remember bikes can go slightly further easier, and there are bike paths etc. Pinch flats are when the tyre is low on air, and an obstruction crushes through the tube into the rim, puncturing the tube with a characteristic two small holes. This is called a snake bite puncture, and can dent/crack your rim if there's enough force. To avoid pinch flats, start by adding more air to your tube. It depends on the width of the tyre, but thin tyres could be 80-100 PSI or thick ones could be 30-60 PSI. Second part of avoiding pinch flats is technique where you don't bulldoze your way through anything in your path. Instead you dodge potholes, or bunny hop over them, or merely learn to "unweight" the bike as you touch an obstruction. This means to get off the saddle and slightly lift the bike as you roll over things. That way there's less pressure on your wheel for the instant it is not on flat pavement. One final help is to minimise the amount of weight on the bike. I started at 110 kg and now am down to 95 kg, and my flats have dropped to ~3 a year when they were almost weekly to begin with. You can also carry less/lighter stuff rather than heavier tools/pump etc. tl:dr minimise and avoid, but can never eliminate completely. 

I doubt any tape will last. Sunlight, rain, friction and wind will knock heck out of both the tape and the printout pretty quick. If they're custom graphics then look at printing onto Tee-shirt transfer paper - the sort which is used to customise t-shirts. Downside is that it needs a high temperature iron to push the image to the cloth. To do that on a bike frame will likely burn the paint. You might get by using a hot air gun/paint stripper blower, but absolutely test this first. Otherwise I'd suggest buying some fine brushes and some model kitset paints. Then use your printout as a stencil and paint directly on the frame. You'll want a steady hand and plenty of time. Once dried, put a heap of clearcoat on top to protect your work. Third option, is to make up a plate like a head-tube badge. Cut and polish a piece of metal, and curve it to fit your bike frame. Then paint the image in place, lacquer/clearcoat that, and stick it on the bike with epoxy. I'd not recommend rivets unless you already have holes in the frame. Do let us know how it goes. 

If the bolt moves, undo it about 2 full turns and then give a gentle tap with a hammer downward. This will knock the wedge loose. If you remove the whole long bolt, the wedge will be left behind. 

I'm assuming you have and want drop bar brifters. The Sora I just worked on was not dual lever, it was more campy-style with one main lever integrated on the brake, and a thumb push lever on the inside of the hood for changing down. I've only ever seen it on Sora, no other Shimano groupset has that format. So be wary if that doesn't sound like you. 

Do consider not using training wheels - a Balance Bike removes that need completely. Once the young rider can ride ~10 metres without touching the ground with their feet, they don't need training wheels. 

THE SETTING MENU CANNOT BE LAUNCHED WHILE RIDING THE BICYCLE: The product is designed in such a way that the settings menu cannot be launched if it detects that the bicycle is being ridden. This is not a sign of an abnormality. Answer: Stop the bicycle to adjust the settings. 

We are lucky enough to have four shared bikes at work, which are available for any employee to ride. Due to NZ compulsory helmet laws, we have to provide some shared helmets. Some people don't like that idea, but its not reasonable to ask them to provide their own if they don't have a bike. What's a helmet-safe anti-cootie spray ? Isopropyl alcohol ? Or should we be providing disposable hairnets like go-cart tracks offer to their patrons? Disinfectants/deodorants like detol or febreeze? Related - there is a bike rental scheme in my city (a bikeshare) and they also must provide helmets for riders. There is a periodic clean of the helmet when the bike is serviced, and they claim that happens 3 times a week Often these helmets stay in the bike's front basket instead of being worn, but they live outside
