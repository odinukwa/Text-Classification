Stuck a large rubber bung in the base of the steerer column to prevent water entering here (even though I have mudguards). I had to shorten the bung slightly to prevent it showing. My saddle clamp encloses the top of the seat post if this wasn't the case I would fill this in a similar manner. This is something I have done on all my frames for the last 20 or more years. Filled every bolt hole with a bolt ensuring ample waterproof grease was applied to the threads. Teflon grease is not great at this I find it gets washed out easily. Marine grease is much better, I use Unipart Marine but there are loads available; they are all considerably cheaper than any proprietary bike grease and I use mine for most applications (hubs, headsets etc) and it last much longer between applications (I commute every day in all weathers). Filled all drain holes as described in step 3 of the Bike Radar winter proofing article. For my frame match sticks were way too small. I used chopsticks, I found snipping approx 3-5 mm off the end and then cutting 5 mm of chopstick was a perfect fit and pretty flush to the frame. Before pushing into the hole I coated in the wood in clear nail varnish (not mine) and then again over the top and overlapping slightly onto the frame once inserted. This varnish prevents water absorption and helps create a seal without using glue. Finally before fitting the bottom bracket I coated the threads of the shell and its interior with the waterproof grease even though already sprayed with Waxoyl. 

A rack specifically designed to mount on a bike with disc brakes would be best, of course. The other options might be cheaper. 

I have two basic commutes, a mixed-mode with 4 miles of bicycle ride, or a 12-mile ride all the way to or from work. In both cases, my favorite route to work is very different from my favorite ride back home, except for the half mile closest to my house and a few miles in the middle of the 12-mile trip. Roughly ordered priority of selection criteria for picking routes, based on thinking about why I take the routes I do: 

If I forget to refill, I have the other water bottle (and probably half of the first). I also use decent quality water bottles that don't make the water taste too bad if it's sat in the bottle for a few days. If for some reason I'm leaving the water bottles inside the house, I'll put them where they block access to something I can't leave the house without, such as putting one in each shoe. (no, really) * 3 bottle cages, actually, but one holds a travel mug that sometimes gets a hot beverage 

It certainly sounds like you should look at going to a wider range of gears. Your triple on the front already seems like a pretty wide range, and unlikely to easily get a wider range up there, so I'm thinking you'd mostly be looking at a wider range on the cassette. The downside of widening your gear range will (generally) be that you'd get less fine tuning of gears inside your range. You should definitely pay attention to the actual gear ratios. Some careful selection (work out all your current gears and figure out what the new gears would be) could help a lot. Right now your low end is basically 1:1 and your high end is 4.1:1. A smallest sprocket of 11 instead of 13 (without changing from a 53) would get you to 4.8:1 for your highest gear, which is about an 18% improvement and could easily be enough to get you the higher-end range it sounds like you need. Much more low end than that might require replacing the rear derailer, but I've seen 11-34, etc, which would get your lowest gear down to 0.8:1. Usually those have a specific "granny" gear on the back that's a big jump, which could still leave you with plenty of fine tuning in the rest of your gear range. 

It's likely that Sheldon's concern was for galvanic corrosion between carbon fiber and aluminum. This is an issue that's well-trod in both the bicycle and aeronautics fields. In essence, in the presence of an electrolyte (sea air, your sweat) and a cathode (carbon fiber-embedded resin) the anode (aluminum) will corrode. In the case of a seatpost/seattube interface, this corrosion will wedge the seatpost in place. This can, at best, make it extremely hard to remove the seatpost. At worst, it can render the frame unusable. The first thing to do is to check to see if your frame was built with an aluminum insert for the seat tube. Given that you currently have a carbon seatpost this is unlikely, but it would alleviate the main concern. If that's not the case, there are still some precautions you can take. As Calfee notes, anodization will provide some protection. As well, regular removal and cleaning and reinstallation with carbon paste can help prevent excessive buildup. On the significantly more expensive side, you could also consider a titanium seatpost, which wouldn't corrode. I'm not sure how the formatting in this article got so ruined, but you can read more in this VeloNews Technical Q&A with Lennard Zinn. 

Apparently George Behring used to be a framebuilder in the St. Louis area, and was a racer and a member of the Saint Louis Cycling Club. Unfortunately, like many small builders of the 1980s, there's very little information about him or his bikes on the web. 

I've had good luck (with cantilever brakes) with Velo Orange's Squeal-Free Brake pads, but many people say that the Salmon compound brake pads from Kool Stop are the best choice for wet conditions. The dual-compound Kool Stops are a good idea, since supposedly they work well in all conditions... My LBS stocks brands, but Kool Stop is a much more usual brand of brake pad to carry. In general: any brake pads that say they're made for wet conditions. 

Assuming that your rims are actually 622x15 ISO size, like the Shimano page for those rims says... According to this handy chart on Sheldon Brown's site, putting a 35mm tire on a 15mm rim is slightly bigger than recommended. It's close enough that it should be fine, however. That chart is fairly conservative (and even says so at the bottom). As far as the widest, you could put 42mm on there if the fork, brakes, stays, bridges and seat tube all have the clearance, but that's really pushing it quite far and likely to cause poor handling or other issues. 35mm is just barely pushing it and should be fine. 

Trek is a large reputable bicycle company. They make a lot of bikes. They're basically all good, if used for what they're made for. There may be a few models now and then that have problems, but that's true of all the bicycle companies. The Trek Atwood WSD appears to basically be a steel version of the Trek 7.1 FX Stagger with some details to make it look a bit more "classic". It's a "hybrid", which are good all-around bikes for riding on paved surfaces. They sell a lot of bicycles with that basic frame shape. It's a very popular general style of bike, from Trek and from other bicycle companies. Hybrids like the Trek Atwood and Trek FX are generally what I would suggest most people shopping for a bike look at first. Definitely a good choice for a beginner, as long as she likes the bike and is comfortable on it. If she's not comfortable on it, you should probably explore getting the fit of the bike adjusted instead of switching to a different bike. It's common to change to a different saddle and to get the handlebars moved around a bit.
