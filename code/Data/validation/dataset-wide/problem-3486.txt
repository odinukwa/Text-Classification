The index is just that, a dimensionless series of numbers (constructed in a particular form). I'm not sure how deep that can go. For instance, if I have a series of prices, say \$1.5 in year 1 and \$3 in year 2, you can turn that into an index like 100 and 200 respectively. The index has no units. It just maps the growth rates of the underlying series into a fixed base (in the example above, 100 in year 1). If you happen to know the original series, you can recover the units of the series. However, the natural question that follows is, what are the units of $A$? In an aggregate production function $Y=F(A,K,L)$, the units and the dimension of $A$ depends on the unit and dimension of the other factors. For example, if $Y$ is units of output per year, $K$ is units of capital per year, and $L$ is number of hours worked per year, then the unit of $A$ is a function of units of output over units of capital and hours. However, if you change $L$ from hours to workers using some transformation (e.g. average working hours), the units of $A$ change too. Now, since it seems you want to compute $Y$, and because you have both (i) obtained an index for $A$ (ii) that is probably not related to the series of $K$ and $L$ you will use to compute $Y$, the units of $Y$ will not have direct meaning. This is, you cannot deduce that the resulting quantity of $Y$ corresponds to, say, millions of Euros per year. Is this bad? Not really, if you are interested in computing the growth rate of $Y$. Finally, is this a logical method to compute $Y$? Absolutely not. Lee Sin's comment is entirely pertinent. You are given $Y$ in national statistics. Why to compute it? Instead, what you want is to study the determinants of growth, which goes into estimating $A$ using methods like Growth accounting. That is a field as old as the Cobb and Douglas production function itself (probably older). 

A consistent picture emerges when looking at papers: YoY yields 3,140 results, whereas QoQ yields 355 results. Now, these are general results, not specific to GDP. But they still reflect the fact that you will not go wrong using YoY, as it is a very familiar figure. Finally, you are correct that QoQ GDP figures are likely to be more volatile than YoY, particular if seasonality has not been accounted for. Another benefit of using YoY growth rates is that people is more used to yearly growth rates, so any analysis will be easier to grasp to the reader. 

I don't want to infringe copyrights so I won't include more figures, but look at Figure 14 (showing an increase in employment of older workers after the Great Recession), and Figure 15 and 16 (showing an increase in employment participation of Lone Mothers). As the authors state: 

Another way to look at this is to notice that optimising a function $f(x)$ is the same than optimising a monotonically transformation of such function. Thus, apply the natural logarithm to the two functions and you get, respectively: $$ \ln u = \frac{1}{3}\left(\ln x + \ln y \right) $$ $$ \ln v = 3\left(\ln x + \ln y \right) $$ Notice that $\ln v = 9\ln u$. Hence, they are indeed the same. 

For example, say I have data on earnings of a working population, whilst my ideal variable is household disposable (after tax/benefits) income. I want to know if there is any basis to state that in general one is higher than the other. Reasons why there might be a systematic difference: 

You are assuming the PC has not shifted over the period. For example, you can see at the top right some sort of PC. To see this better, you need first to analyse the data in evidence for regime shifts. The first suggestion is to connect the points over time. US example below: 

To be precise, a model is said to be a linear regression model when it is linear in its parameters. For extension, a model is said to be non-linear when it is non-linear in its parameter (Wooldridge, 2010, p.397). As such, a linear model can have non-linear variables. A standard example is the Mincer equation, where wage is a linear function of education, experience and experience squared. In your example, as your intuition tells you, parameters $\rho$ and $\beta$ are multiplied themselves, making it a non-linear model. However, your model is a rather special kind of non-linear model because its parameters can still be recovered using linear methods. In fact, you do not need non-linear methods at all. Your model is over-identified as you can test whether the estimated combined term is consistent with the individual estimation of each parameter or not. 

(The quote is from here, but it belongs to Ricardo's 1824 pamphlet "Plan for the Establishment of a National Bank", which can also be found as an appendix on this book) Meanwhile, others consider the "founding father" of central banking to be Walter Bagehot, a "famous" editor of The Economist (you might have noticed that there is still a column under his name) that in 1873 published the book "Lombard Street: A Description of the Money Market", where he advocated for the role of the Bank of England (still a private, for-profit institution) as a lender of last resort in the case of a financial crisis. Despite of this, he also advocated for a free banking sector. A quote (from here): 

It is not clear to me how the above (and maybe other) factors affect the relationship. Can we say anything about it? Are you aware of a systematic study on this? I have seen some studies (e.g. here) for different household types, which differentiate between single adult versus households, but they compare complementary populations (e.g. single adults are not counted within households). Selection issues makes any extrapolation likely to be incorrect. I'm looking for something a bit like the last Figure in this document, which, for the case of Italy, shows that perhaps unsurprisingly, it depends. 

Here is one explanation, albeit focusing on the wider economy, and comparing median wages. Still the method applies: 

Normally, you use bootstrapping when you cannot derive a formula for the variance-covariance matrix of your estimator. Since you do not have this formula, you cannot obtain the standard errors of parameters, and so your econometric analysis is very limited. In these cases, using bootstrapping is the only option available. This is common in complex, non-linear models. Similarly, you do not need them for those cases where you can derive robust, close-form formulas for the standard errors (as in OLS, or linear panel data models, or most of models found in most of textbooks). In this cases, you already have a formula which is asymptotically efficient, and bootstrapping would be redundant, and probably counterproductive if done incorrectly. Notice that bootstrapping is not only useful for obtaining the standard errors of parameters. You can also bootstrap full tests. For example, you can bootstrap the Hausman test that compares RE versus FE. To go this way would imply a longer answer. For a quick and hands-on introduction, check Cameron and Trivedi (2010), Chapter 13. 

Many publishers (e.g. MIT Press, Oxford University Press, Harvard Press, Norton, et cetera) are constantly releasing new economic books. I could subscribe to email alerts for each of them (for example, MIT, OUP, Harvard). However, this has two problems: 

Consider an increase in $A$. This is, for the same number of hours, output of production is larger. The income effect is such that the individual redistributes resources toward the activity which became more productive. This is, the individual decides to work longer (a fall in leisure $l$). This is because the $MPL$ increased in that activity, and so the return of that activity increases. Recall that, because of the "First welfare theorem", the equilibrium in a centralised economy (like Robinson's) is the same than in a decentralised (i.e. market) economy. As such, implicitly, you can think of Robinson paying himself a wage. As $MPL$ increases, ceteris paribus, the equilibrium wage increases, and therefore he works more. The substitution effect is such that the individual redistributes part of the windfall of greater productivity toward other activities which provide him utility (in this case, leisure). Since the optimisation of utility is a process involving "relative quantities", whenever each component faces decreasing marginal utility, the individual will benefit from "restoring the balance" by substituting resources (labour) away from the improved activity (production) towards that which did not improved (leisure). Notice that the substitution effect depends on the nature of the utility function. If the marginal utility of their components are constant (for example, in $U = C + l$), then there is no substitution effect. Here is an example of a utility function and production function where the two effects cancel-out: $$U= log C - 2L^2$$ $$C=Y=AL^\alpha$$ where $L$ is labour. You can easily show that the optimal hours supplied is $L^*=\frac{\sqrt\alpha}{2}$, which is independent of $A$. In other words, the income and substitution effect balance out. 

You can find GDP in constant US dollars for 2011 form almost every country in the world here. See this document or this website for further references. 

A new report by the Roosevelt Institute answers exactly that using a Keynesian, Stock-Flow-Consistent model calibrated to the US. According to their result, when distributional changes are considered, an UBI would considerably stimulate the economy. The Executive Summary reads: 

Ok, rather embarrassing, but the problem was in the formula for $Y_0$. In effect, for $\rho>0$, it is true that $$ Y_{_{L=0}} = AK(1-\alpha)^{\frac{1}{\rho}} $$ However, for the case of $\rho<0$, the limit of $Y$ is zero. The proof is trivial. Rewrite the CES as: $$ Y = AL\left(\alpha + (1-\alpha)\left(\frac{L}{K}\right)^{-\rho} \right)^{\frac{1}{\rho}} $$ Then, it is trivial to see that: $$ \lim_{L\rightarrow 0} Y = A0 \: \alpha^{\frac{1}{\rho}} = 0 $$ With this, we can see that $\Delta Y = Y > 0$. This solves the inconsistency. 

You forgot a key variable in the equation: prices. If there is the same amount of money chasing an increasing number of goods (which happens when more workers are employed in the economy), then prices will fall. This has been formalised in the so called Quantitative Theory of Money. The key equation is: $$ MV=PQ$$ M is money, P are prices, Q is production, and V is velocity of money (disregard for the moment). If M is fixed but Q increases, then P falls. That restores the balance. This idea is very old, and it was set out very nicely by David Hume in "Of the Balance of Trade", published in 1752. Here is the key part of the text: 

My experience is that most of the papers estimating these sort of regressions use real variables, all of them deflected with the same index. As Roy says, you not want to confound an effect by inflation. For example, assume the "true" model is that with variables in real terms: $$ Y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_t $$ Converting into nominal variables, you get: $$ Y_tp_t = \beta_0 p_t + \beta_1 X_tp_t $$ Then, a correct estimation of the "true" model when using nominal variables would require you to add prices as a regressor (or inflation if using log of differences). Thus, you have a further robustness check of your model by estimating it in nominal terms and adding inflations as a regressor. 

By checking other variables, you can confirm that the variable letters are equivalent in this and your reference. Then, $E$ stands for "all non-wage income, taken at the moment received, instead of take when earned". This is a standard differentiation between the time an income has been accrued ($Z$) and when it has actually been received ($E$). You can see more about these definitions later on in the document. In page 49, you find an explanation on how these are calculated (19 is $Z$, 20 is $E$; see table in page 47-48): 

They correspond roughly to the ones in the TE graph. Whilst M1 is indeed larger than M1, the monetary base does not need to be. This is the entry in the Wikipedia article for monetary supply in the US: 

Very interestingly, cognitive ability are much more important than socio-emotional ability for contemporaneous wages, ceteris paribus. However, the next graph (not shown) highlights that for the present value of wages (so, including career progression), socio-economic ability is as important as cognitive ability. As I said, there are hundreds of papers on this area. Here is just one other example, comparing cognitive and non-cognitive ability and labour market returns in Sweden. If you google (or search in $URL$ "cognitive non-cognitive ability return wages" or related, you get tons of hits. 

You need to use PPP rates. These convert basket of goods in one country (in LCU) to that of (normally) the US, in US dollars. You can find these rates here or here. With these rates you can transform nominal GDP in Yuan into nominal GDP in USD. Then, you can use a US CPI or GDP deflator index to transform these nominal international dollars into constant international dollars. The base year is given by the price index you use. You can rear more about PPP and how to use it here. Finally, in case you do not want to bother to calculate this yourself, or that you want to confirm your calculations, here is the actual series of China's GDP in 2011 international dollars. 

Because of a change in regulation about how different accounts are to be recorded. That change was stated in the Financial Accounting Statements No. 166. If you look into Notes on Data relating the "Assets and Liabilities of Commercial Banks in the United States - H.8", you find the following statement from April 9, 2010: 

Part (a) is correct. Your error in (b) is to implicitly assume that relative prices are equal to $1/2$. The best way to understand the problem is using the Edgeworth box (excuse the sloppy picture; will add a custom one when had the time): 

Good question, which goes into the heart of the definition of GDP. The answer is that some of the value of the drink is accounted irrespective of what the seller does with the drink. Recall that GDP accounts for the value added of final goods, value which is "added" at each stage of production (and equivalent to the final price of the good). As such, when the retailer buys the can of coke from the wholesaler or producer, a portion of the total value has already been recorded in GDP. It is only the value added by the retailer which is not counted if the seller drinks the coke. Naturally, this is true only if the seller does not sell the coke to herself. Otherwise it makes no difference at all. 

The authors also perform a calculation of the annual wage loss from low skill foreign-workers not speaking the local language (as wages belong to GDP, this could partly be seen as a GDP loss, but it's not a very decent general equilibrium exercise in my opinion). The results below: 

The elasticity is a very general concept. Consider an arbitrary function $$y=f(x_1,x_2, \cdots , x_n) $$ The elasticity of $y$ with respect to $x_i$ is $$ e_{y,x_i} = \frac{\partial y}{\partial x_i}\frac{x_i}{y} $$ It measures the percentage change of $y$ when variable $x_i$ changes by 1% - a measure of responsiveness, as you say. It can be applied to anything, including the demand and the supply, where you get the common concepts like own-price, cross-price, income elasticity, etc. The sign of the elasticity is given by the sign of the derivative, which depends on the function $f(\cdot)$. Elasticities applied to functions other than standard demand and supply abound. For example, individual factors of production, relative factors of production, investment, taxation, preferences, city size, et cetera. 

As you can imagine, both are not true. The report calculates then the rate of inflation faced by different households, taking Sept of 2008 as example, leading to the following result:

I am perfectly willing to pay nothing to take a taxi ride in NY. If I were have to pay, I am willing to pay no more than \$5 for such ride. Therefore, I am not willing to pay \$10 for such a ride. Add up the valuations of every other potential consumer of taxi rides in NY and you get the demand curve. Thus, this represents the maximum price individuals are willing to pay. Regarding the apparently contradictory "at least" phrase in the second quote, this is consistent with the definition of demand. In effect, whilst the marginal consumer (the 10th million) is in fact willing to pay no more than \$5 for a ride, the other 9,999,999 consumer are willing to pay more than \$5 (for instance, the 8th million individual is willing to pay as much as \$6, whereas the 9th million consumer is willing to pay as much as \$5.5). Hence, strictly speaking it is correct to say that 10 million "New Yorkers" are willing to pay at least \$5 for a ride. This is not a contradiction, but a use of terminology that refers to different groups of people.
