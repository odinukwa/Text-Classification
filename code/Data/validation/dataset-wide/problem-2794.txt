You will find the answer to your question varies greatly from philosopher to philosopher. My preferred answer to the question is to redefine the problem. Arne Naess did this in his philosophy of Deep Ecology. In Deep Ecology, he challenged the typical definitions of "self," involving the body and mind, pointing out places where they did not quite line up with how we use the word "self." He then suggested a different definition, which he argued is more consistent with our use of the word: the ecological self. The ecological self, he argued, is that which the self relates to. In his philosophy, he argued that selfishness is not unethical at all. In fact, he argued that altruism is actually a special case of selfishness. He gave Mother Teresa as an example of someone who, according to the definition of the ecological self, was extremely selfish, but she related to so much of humanity that her ecological self was very broad and deep. Thus, simply by doing what her self wanted (selfishness), she helped a great many people. This choice of definition helps avoid the issue of self-sacrifice that typically comes up when exploring altruism. Instead of treating altruism as giving up one's self to support another, it is treated as a widening of the self to include another. 

Your argument is not consistent. If you state that it is impossible to doubt that you are conscious at t, and later find it is reasonable to doubt that you are conscious at t, then either your logic is flawed or the assumptions are inconsistent. In this case, I think the issue is the transition from exploring states t - Δt and t + Δt and using those to make statements about the state at t. In reality, the statement "But I surely can legitimately doubt that I was conscious at any time t - Δt in the past from now, t." is only valid for Δt>0. Beyond that, there's plenty of skepticism to be had, but there is no straight forward mathematical inconsistency obliged in the argument. 

Your question is difficult to answer because you used the word "truth." Ironically, in a question which referenced the untranslatability of languages, that one word breeds quite a lot of difficulty in 5 short letters. I, personally, use several almost-but-not-quite fungible definitions when talking to different people. For example, science's most commonly used definition of "truth" is vanishing error bounds as N grows large; science accepts results which suggest that, as N goes to infinity, error goes to 0. Science doesn't get to ask a deity what the "truth" is, so it has to rely on its instruments, which are all imperfect. One key pattern that shows up from this approach to "truth" is the desire to remove the observer from the system. We are complicated fickle creatures which makes it hard to develop these vanishing error bounds if we're involved. This is very clear in physical sciences, where the experimental setups are designed to be exceedingly free of human interaction. Drawing from high school physics experiments, they like to see the behavior of materials quantified by balls rolling down an inclined plane, not the behavior of a ball rolled around by a human hand. Doing it that way makes it easier to demonstrate repeatability. As you get to more complicated systems, it becomes harder and harder to set up interesting experiments without involving human effects more and more. One particular human, the observer, becomes particularly hard to remove from the equation. Details like unconscious biases begin to have more of an effect, and it becomes harder to make the argument that the errors vanish for large N. Accordingly, you get a an ordering of scientific topics. A biologist rapidly accepts anything a physicist discovers. A physicist will accept the results of a biologist in his or her daily life, but will try not to let it pollute the "more pure" physics. However, when running short on interesting things to do, the physicist will look at the unexpected results of the biologist and say "maybe I can prove this," which slowly keeps the sciences in sync. XKCD did an amazing job of capturing this feel, in my opinion. 

One key challenge with building such categorizations is that the more specific of prediction you want, the more categories you need to have. On one extreme, "people do what they will do" is right 100% of the time using only one category. Another extreme, "people will always choose money over love" is right some percentage of the time, but still only calls for one category. Another extreme, correctly predicting the exact behavior of every individual for all time calls for a complete mapping of their brainstate... and even then is only possible if you believe in hard determinism. Any level of freewill causes that to get complicated. Which categorization is most useful to any given person is subjective, based on what they believe is the most important features to see in others' actions. 

Its a matter of definitions. Whether it is possible to be an atheist and not be a materialist/physicalist depends on how you define atheist and materialist. Generally speaking, they are different words because people have found them to not define the same thing. Your challenge as an athiestic substance dualist will be accounting for how your freewill affects other minds without a supreme being to tell you. As a non-exclusive list of examples of valid paths forward: 

There's a few tongue in cheek answers. The first is to point out that the question is moot: if an omniscient being was omniscient, it would know whether there was a way to prove their omniscience to a particular observer or not. And if they did know it was possible, they'd know how to do it. The other is to approach this as a radical skeptic and ask whether you can ever know anything. Is it plausible that the omniscient being cannot prove to you that they are omniscient, because nothing can be proven to you up to the standard of proof you are demanding. Beyond that, the question immediately points at the observer. Can the observer be convinced by anything. Is there anything at all that could convince the observer? A scientists might be convinced by a preponderance of evidence. A radically religious person might be convinced by a sign from divinity. Every individual person has their own personal set of approaches through which they may be "convinced by." This kind of issue occurs quite often in empiricism, which is the study of what we can known from our senses. If I see a glass of water on a table, how can I know that there's actually a glass of water there. Maybe I'm just having a stroke and hallucinating. This line of reasoning is well documented, and you can see opinions on both sides of the issue. Personally, I would resolve the situation by introducing the concept of "effectively omniscient," which is an entity which has provided sufficient evidence to the observer that the observer finds it reasonable to treat them as if they were omniscient (the general term for it is empirically adequate). Doing that lowers the bar on the proof to something which is accomplishable via empirical means without causing fundamental logical issues to arise. For example, it opens the door to using zero knowledge proofs which can reduce the chance of the omniscient being simply being "lucky" to any arbitrary amount or point out that the observer's understanding of the universe is flawed enough to make the zero knowledge proof ineffective. If their understanding of the universe is flawed enough, one may ponder whether they actually have the right concept of what "omniscient" means anyways.
