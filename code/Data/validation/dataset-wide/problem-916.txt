This could be a possible way of reading the second stanza. The desert scene so evocative of death could be the site of someone's grave; the "branches grow[ing o]ut of this stony rubbish" correspond to the sprouting of the corpse referenced later on. The "heap of broken images", under this interpretation, would be images of the dead person's life. It's said that you see images of your life flashing before you just before you die; and once you're dead, those images are all that's left of what used to be your life. The branches growing from the grave are probably something metaphysical, perhaps symbolising eternal life after death. The "[s]on of man" cannot say or guess anything about them, for we know only the mortal life, the "heap of broken images", and are blind to what comes after it. We, the mortal children of man, see only the barren desert scene and the remains of the dead person's life, not what is sprouting from their corpse in a different dimension. 

This is why Gale's personality is so important to the plot. Throughout most of the first half of Mockingjay, when Katniss is working firmly with the rebellion, she's doing so under Gale's influence. He's her closest friend in Thirteen, even if she does occasionally lambaste him for his obedience to Coin. When she takes off on her own mission to assassinate Snow, abandoning Coin's orders, it's after Peeta has rejoined her. And her final choice to kill Coin is motivated by the same event - Prim's death - as her choice to abandon Gale. We conclude that Gale is inextricably tied to District 13 and to hatred of the Capitol. While Katniss is firmly on the side of District 13, he remains her friend despite his dedication and willingness to kill for the cause of the war. When she comes to see that the District 13 leadership is as bad as the Capitol leadership, then surely by extension the District 13 soldiers are as bad as the Capitol ones? From this point of view, Gale is just like a Peacekeeper: not inherently bad, but committing murders in the service of a bad leader. It is perhaps symbolic that he ends up working in District 2, where many of the Peacekeepers came from. The differences between Gale and Coin But perhaps comparing Gale to a Peacekeeper is too harsh. He is Katniss's childhood friend, after all, and certainly has no ill-will towards her. Her break with him is less drastic than her break with Coin. What are the differences? Well, obviously, Coin is a leader and therefore responsible for a lot more than the more lowly Gale. But there's more to it than that. Consider the death of Prim - the main motivator for Katniss in turning against Coin and Thirteen. She's pretty much certain that Coin was behind it: the leader of the rebellion is ultimately responsible for actions such as the hovercraft bombing the children. The thing with Gale is that Katniss will never know whether or not he was indirectly involved in Prim's death. Even he doesn't know. He might have been, but all that's certain is that he was a willing participant in the organisation that orchestrated her death. Perhaps the message here is that by joining such an organisation, you might end up being implicated in atrocities without even knowing about it. I'm tempted to say that this uncertainty about Gale's level of involvement in Prim's death can be symbolically linked to uncertainty about whether he's sadistic or simply ruthless. But in truth, his character is never in question: it's absolutely certain that he wasn't knowingly involved in Prim's death. His motives are pure - to destroy the Capitol and liberate the people of the districts - and it's only his methods that are sometimes dubious. Sadistic or ruthless? Thus, I would conclude that Gale is not sadistic, merely ruthless. Both he and Peeta are at times doing the wrong thing for the right reason. When Peeta calls for a ceasefire, he's wrong to do so, but some of his reasoning is valid - as Beetee puts it (after the downfall of Snow), "[w]e have to stop viewing one another as enemies". When Gale advocates extreme measures against the people of District 2 and the Capitol, he's wrong to do so, but he's motivated by his hatred of their leadership and his grief over the fate of his home. To support this conclusion, let's look at the way he talks about bombing the Nut: 

It's deliberately left unclear, but maybe ~2020. Ms Haddix used to have the answer to this question published among the FAQ on her website (you can still see a snapshot of the page here using the Wayback Machine): 

The types of writing in Shakespeare's plays is usually split into three distinct types: rhyming verse, blank verse, and prose. As a general rule of thumb, blank verse is the standard, while rhyming verse is reserved for more flowery speeches or occasions when it's OK to sound a little unnatural, and prose is used for more down-to-earth talk, often between lower-class people. This excellent introductory article to prose and verse in Shakespeare covers not only the meanings and some examples of each of the three (you're probably already familiar with these terms) but also a nice summary of how each of them tends to be used in Shakespeare's plays specifically. Quoting this article with some added emphasis: 

How did I find all this? Using Google Scholar! It took a surprisingly short time to gather all the material presented here. The most time-consuming part was just to write up all of these references in a proper style and translate the German ones. Getting a list of them was pretty easy just from here and here. I only started using Google Scholar recently, but it's an invaluable tool for finding academic references in literature and other subjects. 

Blake's "The Blossom", part of his Songs of Innocence which you can read online, is a very short poem about a sparrow and a robin. The part about the robin reads as follows: 

What is his actual name? There are various references dropped through the story which might give us clues about it, but is there enough for us to deduce or at least guess at either of those "two words" which form his name? 

When Winston and Julia are arrested at the end of Part 2 of 1984, Winston speculates dully that they may have overslept in the room above Charrington's shop, and that it is now the morning instead of the evening: 

I've owned two copies of Michael Ende's The Neverending Story in my life - both English translations, one paperback with a blue cover, one hardback with a red cover inside the dustcover. Both of them clearly distinguished in the text between the parts of the story happening in the Outer World (Bastian in the school attic, etc.) and the parts happening in Fantastica. It's important to distinguish them, because sometimes the nipping back and forth is on the order of paragraphs rather than chapters. 

For What Pet Should I Get, the manuscript was only discovered after his death. As noted by Matt Thrower in a comment, Seuss himself never sent What Pet Should I Get to a publisher. It was rediscovered after his death in a box of old notes, together with projects he'd classified as failures. Apparently he'd thought it wasn't worth publishing: 

Was Edward FitzGerald the first to collect these poems together and publish them in a unified work, or had there been previous published volumes (in any language) of collected works of Omar Khayyám? I'd always assumed the Rubaiyat was the magnum opus of Khayyám himself, rather than being gathered together long after his death by someone else, but am I wrong? 

Presumably this V, in the context of the war, stands for Victory. My question is ... What is the point of this stanza about the old V as contrasted with the new V? What does it say about the 'skinhead' graffiti artist or the narrator's perception of him, or about the narrator himself? Why is it included, and what does it add to the poem? 

I'm struggling to find a good online summary of this book which is thorough enough to include all the details you mention. There's a Wikipedia page, a Wikia page, and a 'synopsis' on Feist's website, but none of these is particularly detailed. 

The point of all this is to make the reader hungry for more, and to leave the door open for Doyle to write as many stories as he wants to. By making clear how many hundreds of cases Holmes is involved in, Doyle is allowing himself to write as many stories as he wants without ever exceeding the quantitative limitations of his character. Making references to specific untold adventures is a way of cementing this fact in readers' heads: saying there are hundreds is one thing, but saying "there are hundreds, such as this and this and this" makes it all sound more plausible, and gives readers something concrete to remember, more than just a number, to support the idea that he has many off-stage adventures. Another purpose of the name-drops is to pique the reader's interest and curiosity. By making us feel as though we're being drop-fed little bits and pieces of a much larger collection of stories, Doyle is exciting and frustrating our desire for more. Even once the entire Sherlock Holmes canon (only 60 stories) is complete, we still know that there are more Holmes tales we haven't seen, some of which sound tantalisingly interesting. A Dutch steamship which nearly cost both Holmes and Watson their lives? A wound watch which was crucial in the solving of a case? A mad colonel, a tired captain, a canary-trainer? What's the story behind all these, and why can't we read them?! The enduring fascination of these occasional name-drops is shown in the amount of non-canonical Holmes stories they've inspired by other writers. Colonel Warburton's madness, the Tired Captain, the Trepoff murder, and probably most if not all of the others have inspired their own works of Holmes fan-fiction by non-Doylian authors. Explicitly giving your readers' imaginations some open possibilities to work with (fanfic being a way for these imaginations to express themselves, even if not one Doyle foresaw or encouraged) is a great way of keeping an engaged fanbase for your stories. 

As for your bonus question about the genre of this poem, I would say it's a classical nonsense rhyme. It should be noted, however, that there are two distinct kinds of nonsense poem: ones like this where the words make sense individually but become nonsensical when put together in the right way, and ones like Lewis Carroll's Jabberwocky which are full of nonsense words. Some would say that only the latter counts as a true nonsense rhyme: 

This is quite a change from the utterly cold, logical, even ruthless man we've seen in Holmes in all the other stories - the man who disdains any distraction from the pursuit of pure reason. 

This passage introduces the description of said ritual: waiting for the bus, dressed almost like a bride, gathering at the graveside, and so on. It's in these lines that the poem transitions from talking about forgetting to talking about communal forgetting. This is the contrast which the last two lines express: when the widow sits at home alone and ignores the past, the very furniture seems to reproach her for her forgetting; but when she takes her place together with the other widows, she receives validation and solidarity as they all sit and forget the past together. 

"Some few minutes later", we see the scene from the point of view of a group of cabmen at Haverstock Hill. By this time, all three parties involved in the chase are in cabs: first the anarchist in a great hurry, then the bacteriologist in hot pursuit, then his wife with his hat and coat pursuing him in turn. Thus, it must have been some time in those "few minutes" offstage that the bacteriologist gets in a cab. (Quote above taken from the story's full text available online.) 

It's up to you to decide whether their relationship is truly a loving one as the manservant claims, or something more sinister that needs to be ended. And that choice of interpretation is part of the game. 

It's intended to be ironic. In his preface to the second edition, Lermontov criticises the readers who - like you - took the title at face value and interpreted it to mean Pechorin was really being modelled as a hero: 

The former MI5 and MI6 agent David John Moore Cornwell used the name John le Carré on his numerous spy novels. Wikipedia explains why he had to write under a pseudonym: 

In Neil Gaiman's novel American Gods, many of the characters Shadow encounters turn out to be somehow part of the world of the gods, even those like Low-Key Lyesmith who'd seemed innocuous. Most of those who don't had either been part of his life before prison, such as Audrey, or were people he met in Lakeside, like Chad Mulligan. All of these characters, at some point in the story, help move the plot along; they have some connection with other characters, integrating them into the world. An exception, as far as I can tell, is Sam Black Crow. She turns up several times through the book, but each appearance feels like a one-off and not really connected to anything else in the story. She could be removed altogether and nothing important would change. What, then, is her purpose in the novel? What role does she play in the story, and why is she important enough to get so many scenes involving her?
