I feel bad asking this question because I've been doing bicycle maintenance for over 20 years and this seems like a noob question. I was unable to find a Shimano manual to answer this question. I just bought a Norco Threshold CX bike with Shimano Ultegra SL-RS685 brake/shift levers. I want to adjust the cable length for the front derailleur to fine-tune the derailleur position. The cable is routed inside the frame and there is no barrel adjuster to be found anywhere. I looked under the brake hood and did not see anything that appeared to be involved in adjusting the cable length. Obviously I could adjust the cable length at the derailleur, by loosening the bolt, moving the cable a tiny bit, and tightening the bolt again. But it seems difficult to do fine adjustment that way. In case you're wondering why I'm adjusting the derailleur on a brand new bike: The front derailleur wasn't shifting properly because the rear fender (installed by bike store) interfered with it. Before I figured that out, I thought the cable length needed adjusting, and I couldn't figure out how to do it. Techically I can leave the cable alone for now, but eventually it will need adjusting and I would like to know how to do that. 

If your bike is still under warranty, I don't think it is worth it. If it isn't, it will for sure put more stress on the frame but I don't think it will brake. This depends a lot of your weight and ride style, and keep in mind Cube says not to do it, so it is your entire responsibility. I wouldn't do it. I am pretty sure you can change your suspension between 80, 100 and 120mm of travel. Please check here. Rock Shox has really good manuals so you might even be able to do it yourself, otherwise take it to your bike shop. Changing a suspension is simple, if you have the patience and the time to learn, and you just need one or two allen tools for most of it. However, sometimes taking the bottom part of the headset from the old fork is a pain. Search on youtube for fork replacement. If you feel like it, I think you can try and if something goes wrong take it to a shop in pieces. They will figure it out :) Before buying, confirm with the seller the fork will fit the frame, specially if it is an used fork he might have shorten the part of it that goes into the headset and it's shorter size might not fit your frame or your favorite stem position. IMPORTANT: Please see @mikes comment below. 

I think the rust on the pad surfaces will go away on its own when you use the brakes. It's probably just a thin layer on the surface. I don't think it hurts the brake disks, since rusted metal is softer than the original metal before rusting. The rust on the backing material probably doesn't matter much either, since you were still able to remove the pads in their current rusty condition. By the way, brakes on cars also rust when they get wet and sit for a few days -- you can hear that they sound different the first time you use them after they got rusty. But that doesn't seem to hurt them -- they still last for tens of thousands of miles. I think the technology is similar to the disk brakes on your bike. 

I also have Shimano M038 shoes that have a recessed SPD cleat and are very good for walking around. The cleat doesn't touch the ground. 

If the shoes seem a little too big, try some insoles. Start with the inexpensive ones you can find in a drugstore for $10. That will keep your foot from moving around inside the shoe without having to tighten the straps/laces so much. And maybe the extra cushion provided by the insoles will make the shoes feel a little more comfortable. 

Adaptation greatly varies from person to person - are your core muscles strong, do you have good flexibility, problem in your column/shoulders, etc. It's har dto give you an answer. One think to take into account is that most road bikes force a a hard posture on the rider, on the pursuit on speed, mainly on your low back and neck. This is true for any ages. Given that you are 43 I would recommend at the very least an endurance bike, instead of a road one. They are very similar, but endurance bikes are designed to race on hard surfaces like cobalt, and have some compliance on the frame, slightly bigger tires and softer contact points with your body. Take a look here so you have an idea of what I am talking about. Another option is a cyclocross bike which might be even more comfortable, and its still a fast road bike. Keep in mind the best bike is not the lightest one or the more aerodynamic, is the one you feel better and have more fun in, so resist the temptation to get the cool think on the shop and get something that suits you the best. It doesn't really matter if you take 5 more minutes for the that 10 mile run. Whatever you choose, make an effort to maintain a good posture while riding and ask your shop to check your biometrics and adapt the bike for your body, and it's also a good idea to start slow, instead of going right away for a 60 km bike ride to test 'the ergonomics'. With the right bike and since you are a cyclist I am pretty sure you will adapt in 2 or 3 weeks. You should try to cycle more than once per week though, even if it's just small shopping trips. 

For many years, I used cheap Forte pedals (Performance Bicycle house brand) with a platform on one side and SPD on the other side. This was on a mountain bike. Shimano M-324 pedals look very similar ($45 at Amazon) I used these pedals for years for all kinds of riding, including singletrack. The dual-sided nature of the pedals made it a bit tricky to get started in difficult spots on the trail, but it would be very easy if you're riding on the road 

I have a Norco Threshold cyclocross bike ($URL$ . It has a PF30 bottom bracket and an FSA Energy Cross PF30 46/36T crank. The BB is making a lot of clicking and creaking noises, and if this cannot be fixed, I am thinking about replacing the bottom bracket with a Praxis Conversion BB ($URL$ That BB is designed to replace a PF30 BB. It is supposed to work with "Shimanoâ„¢ Hollowtech II steel spindle road cranks only". Praxis also offers variants of the same Conversion BB for Shimano Mountain, SRAM road/mountain, Campagnolo. I assume I can ignore the Campagnolo variant. I am trying to figure out if it will work with my existing FSA Energy Cross crank. I am unable to tell what the difference is between various types of cranks. A lot of websites talk about "24mm standard" but I have no idea what that means. Is it the same as Shimano Hollowtech 2 ? What characteristics must be the same for two cranks to be compatible ? Diameter, Length, something else ? This is the crank: $URL$ On the page, it says "BB30", but it also has a "PF30" logo. Does that mean it works with both types of bottom brackets ? 

It depends what kind of lock you have. If it took a thief a failed attempt I assume it's a good one, so take it to a locksmith or anyone with power tools, preferably with a proof of ownership of the bike. The harder it is to destroy, the more convinced you should be that you should buy the exact same lock again :) 

As @Slovakov said, these kind of protections are never seen in XC, the main reason being that XC is a low risk activity. You usually go at slower paces and you never put yourself in situations where there is a likely chance you can loose control and have a high speed crash in a dangerous zone (as you do in downhill or freeride, for example). Of course you can fall and hurt yourself, but you can fall and hurt yourself if you are trail running, you can twist an ankle if you are playing basketball, or hurt a tendon weightlifting. You have to understand physical activity isn't without a certain degree of risk. The only reason why helmets are highly recommended is because, even in the unlikely event of having a crash, an impact in your skull can have huge consequences for yourself - much more than any other part of your body. Also, if you are concerned with your safety, it is my belief training yourself and learning to ride a bike in a technical situation is a very valuable skill. Lower your saddle, move your ass right to the back, learn to control and feel your brakes, etc. Start with easy areas and progressively advance to places which are more rocky and have more inclination. Being comfortable around these situation plays a big part in your safety. With that said, if you still want knee protection, the most lightweight I know of are POC VDP Air Knee and Elbow Pads, Dainese Trail Skins or Race Face Charge Leg Guards. Six Six One also makes pads with various densities. You will easily find all of these with a Google search. Have fun and safe riding :) 

How do you get to Carnegie Hall? Practice, Practice, Practice. There is no magic bullet for dealing with this problem ( it's the same problem you'll have adjusting cones on a hub. ) Knowing just how loose to leave it so it's tightened correctly when you're done is something that comes with experience. This tweaking required to get it just right is one of the reasons threadless headsets were invented. They take far less labor and effort to install. One trick I've tried is to slightly overtighten and then use the lower wrench to tighten up against the locknut. Either way it helps if you keep pressure on both wrenches rather than trying to keep one still while tightening the other. 

A lot depends on what you mean by "trail/downhill" and by "work". It wasn't that long ago that a full squish 100mm fork bike was a full on downhill machine. However, the big drawback to that bike as a descender is the relatively steep head angles. Putting a bigger fork will help with that, but it won't help with the issue of how robust the parts are relative to the use. Lefty forks are meant for XC lightweight applications, not for landing 10 ft drops. Putting a slightly longer and more robust fork on that bike will help a lot with feeling in control on descents, but it's still an XC bike and has limitations in how hard you can ride it. It all depends how rugged your trails are and how hard you intend to ride. If you still want a mostly XC bike that handles descents more effortlessly then a fork upgrade makes sense. However, if you're looking to go beyond that then you really should consider getting a different bike. Having said all that, outside of a terrain park, I don't think there are many trails that couldn't be descended with that bike. It's just a question of how fast, how much fun and how much skill is required. 

I think the best option is to buy a digital torque wrench adapter (for example, this) and check if your wrench "clicks" when the adapter is showing the desired value. It's a bit pricey, but that's how it is, and you can use it many times. You can also send it to a specialized place that do that for you, such as this, but although I am not sure how much this costs, it should be (much more) pricier than buying the digital adapter, and you will have to do it again eventually. You can also do something like @Nik suggested, which is similar to what you can find here, but I think this is difficult to do right and worse, it's very error-prone. 

First, I think you made a good decision. Hydraulic disc brakes are the way to go, and the M355 are really nice for the price. Also, I assume brake pads/discs are not contaminated and caliper is straight in relation to the disc. These are indeed the cheapest brakes, and therefore there is not much place for adjustments. If without touching the lever the pads don't touch the disk, and when you apply they do, than I would say they are ok. Maybe you would like them to do have a tighter feel, but with this model there isn't much you can do apart from lever distance to handlebar (play with this a little to feel confortable). I don't think overbleeding helps. It shouldn't cause any harm, but the brakes were designed to work in a specific way, so it might affect behavior under heat, or might be causing the "instant brake" feel you are talking about, or might cause rubbing with new pads. Another thing to notice is that it is normal, even in good brakes, that the rear and front feels slightly different, because of expansion on the tube under braking (there is so much tube going to the rear, right?). And also, as the rider you are more sensible to brake forces in the front, and they affect more the dynamics of the bike. One thing I would recommend you to do is to bleed according to manufacturer's instructions and try to adapt. The change from pads or mechanical disc is huge in terms of the relation between lever force - braking force, and it is normal that as a rider you need some time to feel comfortable as you change muscle memory. For example, on my road bike I always pull the lever/pads with as much strength as I can to do an emergency brake, whereas in my mountain bike with hydraulics I have to re-teach myself that I must always modulate brake lever even in an emergency brake. The dynamics are very different. Of course there might be something wrong with them, but from your description I doubt it. If you can't take it out of your mind though, go to a shop, pretend you want to buy a bike with the same brakes as you have and ask for a small test-drive :) 

I had a persistent problem with squealing Shimano LX V-brakes years ago. Switching to XT V-brakes and trying 5 different kinds of brake pads didn't help. Toe in, toe out, no toe, mistletoe - nothing made any difference. Eventually I got a new fork with disk brake mounting tabs and installed an inexpensive mechanical disk brake (Avid) and never had to worry about any part of the brake ever again. It was easy to install and 100% trouble free for over 5 years. 

The only missing part is that we don't know if the initial setting (corresponding to the torque of the wrench's own weight) is accurate. You could find the center of the mass and measure its distance from the point where sockets are attached to the wrench, then calculate the torque from the weight and distance. 

Regarding Q2 -- I think both brakes should feel like your front brake -- when the pads contact the rotor, the lever feel should change instantly. If this is not the case for the rear brake, I assume it is due to (tiny) air bubbles somewhere in the rear brake system. It is strange that in spite of this, you observe that the front provides less braking power than the rear. Perhaps the front brake pads or disk are contaminated with brake fluid or some other liquid ? 

Before starting, your fork looks pretty nice. Are you sure you can't send it to FOX and rebuild it? Why do you say it is ruined? About the fork size, please check the cube FAQ: 

I think your best option is to change the crank. A 2015 Deore or a SLX crank are not only extremely good value for money but they also carry a lot of modern technologies (search the net for reviews, everybody loves them) comparing with your old 2002 product. A modern 2015 Deore (cheapest, entry level) works much better than a 2002 XTR because 13 years of development really make a big difference. Good luck and happy riding. 

I can't precisely tell you which one you need with a picture, and I didn't find a good one in the internet. The bottom bracket you need is either an OctaLink or a Square bottom bracket. You should be able to figure out just by looking at your bike. Before buying you need to check both the shell and the spindle lengths, as you can see here. It is really easy to remove and install a new one, but you will need to buy a crank extractor and a bottom bracket removal tool. These aren't tools you will use very much so just get the cheapest ones you can find. You will also need generic tools to unscrew the crank, but you can figure these ones out. You can find detailed instructions on how to do this here, or just search for a youtube video. Before installing the new one grease the hell out of those threads so it won't be a pain to remove next time, and because that part is very exposed to the elements. Stupid elements! 

A well built wheel should go years without needed truing. If you are truing the wheel every 2 months something is wrong with the build. There's no way to know via the internet, but my guess is that it's one of two things. 

This would never work due to fact that no force would be transmitted to the rear wheel until the derailleur cage was at maximum extension. The derailleur has to be below the chainstay to allow it to take up the slack in the chain. I suppose you could split the derailleur into to parts, one to keep the chain tension and the other to change gears, but that seems excessively complex. The real solution to the derailleur problem is an internally geared hub. 

Often while mountain biking a twig or rock will get stuck between the swing arms on your front derailleur. This effectively locks the derailleur in place until the rock/twig works itself out. If it happens again, stop and examine the derailleur. Generally you can't see the obstruction while you're riding. 

Two is the killer problem, take the crank and 11 speed chain and see if it getting caught between the rings is a real problem. If not, it's worth a shot. You won't break anything by trying it and you'll have to decide if you can live with the changes in shifting performance.
