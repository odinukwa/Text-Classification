Assuming that the decibel level is the same with and without headphones in, does headphone use damage my hearing? I have found several articles that talk about this, but they don't cite scientific studies. A lot of claims are made such as 

I read yesterday that a single egg contains 70% of my daily cholesterol. I will frequently cook myself an omlette for lunch with 2-3 eggs. Is this unhealthy if I do it more than once a week? 

Are MP3 players capable of these volumes, and if so, is an MP3 player at 120dB more dangerous than a rock concert at 120dB? Do ears have different levels of 'toughness'? 

This study suggests that there is a tendency for Indian men to have shorter penises than the 'International Standard'. 

Update Here's a larger report, collated from this data, which included whether it is measured or reported: 

A lot is written about The Pomodoro Technique on various productivity blogs, is there any hard evidence that it improves productivity compared to basic scheduling of work? 

Of the countries that were polled, which represent half of all Muslims worldwide, 15.66% of those Muslims admitted to pollsters that it is justified to use suicide bombs against civilians to defend Islam. These "radial Islamist" would account for 8.176% of all jihadists worldwide. The low figure of the range seems reasonable, but the chart above is missing some notable countries with large Muslim populations Nigeria (4.7%) and India (10.9%). Pew hasn't polled India to my knowledge, but Nigeria has and the results were wildly different for radical Islamists (8% 2013 and 34% 2010). 

If the WHO wants to use this study to say, "Passive Smoke Does Cause Lung Cancer - Don't Let Them Fool You," shouldn't they also mention it's preventative effect on children? (i.e. The press release should have said, "Passive Smoke Does Cause Lung Cancer, Unless You Are a Child?" 

NO WAY anyone knows. Although their are biological reasons like those noted in other answers, reliable estimates are not available to make a determination one way or the other. What was the Question? Todd Akin's comments were taken out of context. Here is the full text of what Todd Akin said about rape, and the (video link). 

source: Red Cross' Blog There are many complications associated with the Heimlich maneuver, some severe, which has led to many people detracting from the method. All sorts of things in the abdomen can rupture when under high pressure. Realize that it should be used as a final solution, with care, much like CPR (which can break ribs or kill victims, too), in the event that it is administered. Care should be taken, too, when forcibly slapping someone on the back when choking (which can also even lead to death). Concluding There is no doubt within the scientific community that the Heimlich maneuver can lead to complications, neither is there doubt that it has been administrated to people choking whom thereafter were not choking anymore. There is not enough evidence to support the alternative presented by the Red Cross, but neither is there enough evidence to detract from it. 

source: Soroudi A. et al., 2011 The US National Library of Medicine advocates using the technique after less dangerous methods have been exhausted. Their source for claiming so is Rosen's Emergency Medicine: Concepts and Clinical Practice. The maneuver is still taught in many classes. Reported Detractors The Red Cross has published guidelines in 2006 that do still show the Heimlich maneuver. The change is that first slaps on the back are recommended, and only then abdominal thrusts (Heimlich). This has been reported to be downgrading or detracting from the Heimlich maneuver. However: 

It appears that Brigitte Gabriel was speaking of jihadist, that are fighting a war to defend or spread their Muslim beliefs. With that definition, we can look at some of the polls by the Pew Research Center regarding support for suicide bombing. They have been performing this poll of Muslims in various countries since 2002, with some variation of the question below. 

What percentage of rapists say their primary motivation was sexual release? Note: This question is not about statutory rape. It is about forced sexual intercourse. 

No Treasury Direct shows that the Public Debt has increased every year (tables 2010-2000 and 1999-1990). 

At the NAACP, Attorney General Eric Holder said Tuesday he opposes a new photo ID requirement in Texas elections because: 

Senator John Cornyn is incorrect that this was an Executive Order, which has a very specific meaning. Congress may have (debatable) granted the Secretary of Homeland Security prosecutorial discretion to delay the deportation of children who have come to the USA illegally. His numbers and country of origin are accurate though. The vast majority are from Mexico, and the hundreds of thousands that have been granted deferred action may be encouraging the influx of thousands of illegal alien children. 

For a good overview of the history of Mozart Effect research, this paper, The Mozart effect: Tracking the evolution of a scientiﬁc legend - it looks like a good read. The Skeptic's Dictionary also has a good article on it. 

Some sports drinks, and even vegetables claim to be 'more hydrating than water'. What does this even mean? How is 'hydration' even measured? If I ate enough cucumbers could I survive without ever drinking anything at all? 

Having read this Guardian article it seems LSD is a much less harmful drug (both to the user and to others) than alcohol. I live in the UK, where alcohol is legal to buy from age 18 (and to drink from even younger), but LSD is a class A drug - the highest classification. What's the basis for this classification? Update: Amusingly, it seems LSD can actually help alcoholics kick the habit. 

No definitive study appears to have been carried out, but the Mozart effect has no effect on spatial awareness:

A journal article on the topic found a negligible (but non-zero) effect of carbonated waters on tooth enamel. The claim in the Daily Mail is clearly in dissonance with the results from this study. 

source: "Business Insider: Health Medical Dr. Heimlich Is Horrified By The Red Cross' Protocol For Saving Choking Victims" Heimlich himself at 96 did administer his eponymous technique to a woman in his retirement home with effective results, so he obviously still stands by his original claims. 

Their claim notes the source as "Census Bureau data by the Journal of Blacks in higher education", which I couldn't find a more specific resource for. Are these statements otherwise verified? I can imagine African immigrants having the highest immigration demands of any group, but the statements still seem counter-intuitive considering funding issues for academia in large parts of Africa. 

Source: Asian J Sports Med. Sep 2012; 3(3): 185–192. Therefore, it seems fair to assume a positive effect on IgA levels from morning sex. Based on the study by Hejazi and Hosseini, I'd advise the 'short drill' version to avoid an inadvertent negative effect stemming from endurance exercise. 

Similar findings are found in other studies. The fourth release of the National Incidence Study of Child Abuse and Neglect (NIS-4), 2004-2009 had similar findings. In the NIS-4 marital status is highly correlated with abuse. 

What is even more telling, is that the papers were only reporting as either endorsing, expressing on opinion, or rejecting AGW. They did not choose to report the level of endorsement which the peer-reviewed studies were classified. So, from this study it is impossible to know what percentage of study abstracts/respondent authors endorse the position the humans are the primary cause of recent global warming. There have been other studies that put that figure around 54% (+/-4%). Which interestingly enough, matches the public's perception on the matter. 

I still prefer my more humorous answer, but with the idea that it is better to keep it simple, I have added this answer as well. We will see which one people prefer. The Surgeon Generals key claim revolves around the fact that 69 chemicals in second-hand smoke are carcinogens, so there is no risk free exposure level. From the EPA's Toxicology Assesment: 

Source: New York Times article on Mosquitoes Cool Down during Blood Feeding to Avoid Overheating - Lahondère and Lazzari, Curr Biol. 2012 The pee is not the cause of the allergical 'itch'. The mosquito's saliva is the cause of that effect - it injects it to prevent coagulation in the blood. 

An article doing the rounds on my Facebook feed claims that African immigrants are the most successful group in the United States when it comes to academic achievement. African-born immigrants are more likely to be college educated than any other immigrant group, it says. 

In this United Nations Assistance Mission to Iraq (UNAMI) press release it is claimed that 1500 Yazidi and Christian persons may have been forced into sexual slavery by ISIS. The source for these statements is the Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General for Iraq Nickolay Mladenov and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict Zainab Hawa Bangura. Does their claim hold water? 

(Note: FBI statistics do not differentiate between accusers who lie, make an honest mistake. Neither does it preclude that a rape didn't take place, only that the person accused was innocent.) False accusations will clearly affect any estimates of legitimate rapes, which will in turn affect any study based upon unsubstantiated claims of rape by the "victim." Todd Akin clarified what he meant when he said "legitimate rape," but lets explore some other possible explanations for what is legally a rape, instead of resorting to believing that Todd Akin must have meant women who weren't asking for it, didn't fight hard enough, or were the victims of war crimes. These cases might not cause a biological response in the victim, because the aren't forcible rape. 

Your food isn't even safe. Bananas because of their high potassium content, contain more [radioactive Potassium] than other fruit. Eating 2 bananas a day for a year would expose you to more radiation than you would get from a single chest x-ray (about 10 mrem). Chinese oil cooking fumes, barbequed foods causing Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in the food or carcinogens from the wood smoke itself, there is no risk free exposure to anything. 

The Benefits Informally, many people have been reported to have survived after having been administered the Heimlich maneuver. Some people reportedly still breathing after the technique include Ronald Reagan, Elizabeth Taylor and Goldie Hawn. Usually, these reports describe people choking on solid food items. Apart from the study below, I have found no non other scientific sources that showed statistics (other than Heimlich's own reports). 

The article you link to quotes Debby Herbenick for this statement. There are studies showing the levels of Immunoglobulin A (IgA) are increased after morning exercise and studies that indicate increased levels of IgA correlated with sexual activity. IgA has been shown to be vital in mucosal immunity. 

Source: Mucosal Immunology (2008) Supporting the claim by Debby Herbenick, a study by Carl Charnetski and Francis Brennan showed a positive correlation between higher sexual activity and IgA levels in college students. Noting: 

Scope: My answer comprises sources that support efficacy for the Heimlich Maneuver to alleviate choking, and sources that show a lack of evidence for a comparison with other methods. I consider only the risks and benefits in healthy individuals between the ages of 1 and 65 of the maneuver for Foreign Body Airway Obstruction (FBAO). I interpret 'most appropriate' as 'the method with highest patient survival rate'. Out of scope: Drowning (which is not choking, and even Heimlich has retracted support there), infants, the elderly, the sick, Heimlich's son hating him, Heimlich's personal flaws and support of controversial AIDS cures. 

It does depend. In the USA, the Federal Trade Commission says that you can limit your liability for fraudulent electronic transactions that are reported within 60 days. 

Fill in the blank however you want, water, bananas, BBQ smoke, Chinese grills, or anything else. Living is full of risk, the only away to avoid all risk is to cease to exist. The Surgeon General's warning about there being no risk-free level of secondhand smoke exposure is misleading, and ignores hundreds of years of toxicology that show that all poisons have some minor exposure level that is not harmful. If brief exposure to secondhand smoke has you running scared, don't forget about thirdhand smoke. 

Using data from the (National Violence Against Women Survey) own Relative Standard Error chart, you will note that this gives an RSE of >30%, which means that Gottshall ignored the NVAWS recommendations about making statistical comparisons regarding subsets with such high RSE. In the politico article (linked above as the Update: secondary ref), Jonathan Gottschall even admits:
