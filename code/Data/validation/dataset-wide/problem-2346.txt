Know your woods. In addition to materials that fly away, which are obvious no-no's for safety reasons, the other source of burning cinders is wood that pops, throwing embers at you. As a very broad generalization, wood from evergreens tends to spit and pop quite a bit more than hardwoods. If you've got any choice at all in the matter, use evergreens to get your fire started, as they tend to catch pretty easily, but switch to hardwoods for fuel after that. Hardwoods will burn hotter, more evenly, and with less popping and sparking than pines, cedars, and so on. 

No question about it -- use a life vest. Make sure you're using a secure, tight-fitting jacket, though. The ones I've always used have several straps across the front so you can get a good, snug fit. If the jacket isn't fitted properly, you stand a good chance of the jacket popping up around your face when you go in the drink. A tight-fitting jacket also helps the people in the raft haul your sogginess back into the boat -- it's a lot safer and more reliable to grab your jacket to haul you in than to try to pull your arms out of their sockets. While you're at it, don't forget a lid. When you get sucked under the boat, you may go head-first into the rocks, and you'll be glad you're wearing a helmet. 

I am investigating the feasibility of a hike looping around Hofsjökull. Among the foreseen challenges are 17 crossings of named rivers (and many smaller ones). All rivers I need to cross have 4WD roads fording through downstream from where I will be hiking, sometimes quite far downstream after the confluence of several more rivers. From a driver's perspective, I have seen the recommendation, “if you wouldn't ford it on foot, don't ford it by car”. Logically, it should follow that if a 4WD road does ford a river, it should be fordable on foot (weather permitting). Is this accurate? Can I infer from the observation that a 4WD road has an unbridged river crossing downstream that it may be fordable on foot upstream? Edit: For the purpose of this question, please assume complete sterility. I am considering only fordability due to water depth and force. I am not interesting in dangers from carnivorous animals in the water. 

Treat your compass as a precision instrument and store it well away from your other electronic devices. Consider purchasing a compass cover that will offer some protection Don't trust your compass blindly. Develop the habit of checking your needle at the start of every trip and also checking that your bearings are consistent with what you're seeing on the ground while you're on the move. 

Is there really such a clear dichotomy between open tarps and enclosed tents? The OP implies that open tarps offer a qualitatively different and superior experience to enclosed tents. My response would be: not for everyone, and not in all conditions. In reality there's a continuum from cowboy-camping through many types of tarp, to tarps combined with a bivy or nest, through many types of tarp tent and on to conventional tents. As soon as a tarper adds a groundsheet and insect protection they're carrying the same components as a tarp-tent, so the whole distinction becomes pretty moot. For example I now use a tarp-tent that weighs less than my old tarp/nest setup. Are you really more "at one with nature" when imprisoned in a tiny bivy under a flat tarp in storm-pitch? And even with a conventional tent many people sleep with the doors open when conditions permit. The whole issue is quite ambiguous and nuanced. In practice the best choice is a balance between personal preference and local conditions I know people who flat-out hate the idea of tarping. They walk all day in nature but find that they sleep better with the psychological protection of an enclosed tent. And this is surely a perfectly valid choice? But even for minimalists the sensible choice will vary with conditions. In the New England woods tarping could be great for some. In an Icelandic dust-storm, not so much. Some ultralight tarpers will put up with almost any level of discomfort or inconvenience in pursuit of their ideal, but most of us are more pragmatic. Where tarping breaks down: a summer trek in the Scottish hills In the right conditions I love to cowboy-camp or tarp. But not on a multi-day in the Highlands... If I camp in a sheltered site I might be dealing with hellacious swarms of biting midges. If I choose a high and exposed site to avoid the beasties I may be hit by sudden 70mph winds and driving rain from unpredictable directions. I may have to camp on very boggy ground. And the ticks can carry Lyme's. I could cobble something together with a flat tarp and bivy. But it will be less practical, less safe and likely no lighter than a storm-worthy tarp tent with integrated insect net and bathtub groundsheet. The tent wins - I'm there to have fun, not to meet a Platonic ideal of purity. So in Scotland it's vanishingly rare to see a tarp in the hills (the exception is the TrailStar with nest, but that's a special case). You'll find the same in Scandinavia. In northern Europe tarping is generally restricted to the woodcraft crowd, and for good reason. I'm sure there are many other scenarios where tarping is a step too far for most. Pragmatism trumps dogmatism With ultralight tarpers you often find there's a whiff of "holier than thou" as though their experience is somehow more pure and more valid than everyone else's. But we all go to the hills for our own motives and enjoy wild land in different ways. So find the balance that works for you and your local conditions, and hike your own hike! 

Sirex & Rory have covered getting them out of the water pretty well, but given that getting them out of the water in the first place might be no small feat, you're right in understanding that you're far from out-of-the-woods, so to speak, even after they're out. Getting the victim warmed up is paramount, and their wet clothes are going to be a serious impediment. If there's any way to get them out of their wet clothes and into some dry clothes, that's pretty high on your list. Some possibilities: 

The whole idea of changing clothes is that your hiker will be lots more likely to be able to warm himself back up in dry clothes than in wet clothes, so you're looking for any reasonable option to help that happen. Next, you need to assess your status and consider getting the whole group to safety as soon as possible. If you've been able to get your soggy hiker into some dry clothes (fully or partially), you may be able to just continue your hike. You'll generate some body heat by moving, which will help some. If you have a short distance to travel in order to reach shelter / warmth, this is probably your best bet. If, however, it's cold enough that you're not going to warm up by hiking, or if you don't have dry clothes, or you had to borrow some clothes from someone (leaving two or more hikers under-dressed) I'd strongly consider getting a fire started in order to warm up and dry off. Some sort of reflective surface (tarp, rock wall, etc.) may help warm you a little more evenly. Dry out your clothes, but don't burn them! Keep an eye on time vs. your itinerary. If stopping to build a fire will cause you to not be off the trail by nightfall, you'll need to decide if you're staying put overnight or sending someone out for help. All the usual wilderness first-aid guidelines apply here -- don't send anyone anywhere alone, and a group of four is a great deal better than a group of two or three. If you don't have a large enough group to send a capable party for help, I'd be inclined to stay put and keep the group together. The whole idea here is to keep your head and use the resources of the group to avoid making the situation worse while you're trying to recover. 

I think you're going to have problems with camping. The age of responsibility in Italian law is 18 years. I've looked at the terms and conditions of a number of campsites, and they all say that each group must have at least one responsible adult. I suspect that this will vary from site to site depending on their insurance etc, but on a quick search I was unable to find a site that would accept you. And you can't bluff it, as they will ask to see your passport when you arrive. But it wasn't hard to find hostels who will take you, provided you have original written permission from your parents. Obviously, it would be sensible to contact them in advance to make sure there is no misunderstanding, so you don't have problems when you arrive. 

Personally the sleeping mat is one of the last things I would leave out of my pack. Inflatable mats with internal baffles like the top-of-the-range Thermarests and Expeds are much less bulky than closed-cell foam mats, and much warmer and more comfortable too. Perhaps I'm getting soft in my old age, but for me a good night's sleep is worth a lot on a long trip and a good sleeping pad more than earns its weight and volume. And in many situations there are clear environmental issues with improvising your own mattress. In emergencies, yes. But doing this routinely is hardly "leave-no-trace" unless you are in a very remote and lightly used area. As kids in the Scottish hills before the days of mats we generally relied on a good pile of heather. The springy structure seems to trap air well and retain some loft, yet it's flexible enough to remain quite soft. I remember being pretty comfortable even in snow and frost. If there's heather around where you are it should be the first thing you try, always provided it's legal and responsible to cut it. 

Within Parque Natural Sierra de Grazalema, is the Zona de Reserva, for which special permits are required: 

In May this year (6–8 May) I will have a workshop in Mammoth Lakes, California. I would like to do some hiking in addition to this workshop (roughly one week). I have never been to the United States, but I have considerably experience with trekking in the solitude of the tundra of northern Fennoscandinavia. I'm aiming for a solo wilderness hike with camping in the wild. At the end I should have some way of getting back to the beginning, as I will need to store away luggage somewhere. There appear to be many scenic areas near Mammoth Lakes. From sources such as topoquest, National Forest Locator Map, and wilderness.net I find a number of areas in the vicinity: John Muir Wilderness, Inyo National Forest, Sierra National Forest, Ansel Adams Wilderness, Kings Canyon National Park, Yosemite National Park, Hoover Wilderness, and others. More than enough choice. The main limiting factor: it's only May and I expect that the high mountain passes will be completely blocked by snow. Trails such as the John Muir Trail and the Pacific Crest Trail appear to reach rather high elevations. Up to what elevation should I normally expect passable terrain in May? Is it feasable to hike in the area I described above, or should I search for a more low-lying region? I will subsequently travel overland to the Mid-West, so it could also be in Nevada, Utah or Colorado. I realise this is a huge area, and I don't have a strong preference to a particular place. I can either hike or well-established trails, on little-known trails, or sections with no trail at all. 

No commercial interest here - just a happy user. Small companies with the courage to innovate deserve support, I feel. 

The industry showed no interest in a product that challenged their current offerings, so the inventor set up her own little business to produce them. The PacerPoles have a devoted following in the UK, where they are used by most of the best-known writers and reviewers such as Chris Townsend, but they are little known elsewhere. Now the process has gone full circle and people are using the PacerPoles for skiing. It's a very conservative market niche, and this is the only meaningful development I'm aware of in the field. But I would encourage people to think outside of the box and not to settle for an inherently flawed design. 

The well known trekker Andrew Skurka has been testing factory-applied clothing with guided groups in tough conditions in Alaska and has found it very effective. Anecdotal evidence from blogs and forums also suggests that it works well. Protecting your skin The options here are less clear. Permethrin isn't suitable, and while DEET is effective there are increasing safety concerns, and bans are being introduced in many jurisdictions. My own experience is that solutions that work for some don't work for others - the factors that attract biting insects are complex and seem to vary from person to person. So trial and error is required. The failsafe approach is to use netting and clothing as a barrier. You can even buy or make netting mits. Nets treated with permethrin are more effective, as insects will be killed before they can find any gaps in your protection. With DEET on the way out, the emerging alternative is Saltidin (also known as Icaridin) which was released by Bayer in 2001. It is regarded as less toxic, is more pleasant on the skin and doesn't attack plastics, but it's not quite as effective as DEET in high intensity situations. It's pretty popular in Scotland for countering the dreaded midges, though as always some people find it doesn't work for them. Another alternative popular in Europe is Wilmas Nordic Summer Insect Repellent based on Scandinavian folk remedies - no research that I'm aware of, but lots of anecdotal evidence that it works for some. Has a strange odour like a wood fire which is not entirely unpleasant. The final option popular in Scotland is, strangely, Avon's Skin So Soft body spray (blue bottle). It became widely used by the Royal Marines after their wives reported that it worked. There are rumours that the SAS and the US Special Forces are using it for jungle warfare. Some swear by it, while others find it useless. Another popular remedy is B-vitamin supplementation or patches, but this has been carefully studied and found to be ineffective. Taking garlic capsules has not been researched, so far as I can determine, but researchers are open minded that it might be somewhat effective. Finally you might want to keep an eye on the guys at Kite Products who raised over $500,000 through crowdfunding to develop what they claim, with some credibility, to be a breakthrough mosquito repellant. They should be launching their first products in 2016. Avoidance is the best cure - if not always possible! It hardly needs saying, but whenever possible try and avoid exposure: 

What you are looking for is a walkie-talkie / two-way radio / private mobile radio with voice control. Normally, to communicate with a walkie-talkie, you need to press a transmit button. Some models, however, have voice-control: they will automatically start transmitting based on voice input. My friend and I used the Midland G7 XTR, that includes this feature. We did not use the voice control, so I don't know how well it works. We were quite worried about battery lifetimes, and wanted to prevent our walkie-talkies from transmitting without need (there are other sounds in nature besides our voice). In principle, though, walkie-talkie with voice control should be exactly what you need. 

Omnimap seem to have all 1:50k maps with a delivery time of around two weeks. However, Omnimap are quite expensive (US$ 16.95 per sheet). By comparison, MapWorld New Zealand charges NZ$ 7.90 (US$ 6.50) per map. Land Information New Zealand have a (probably incomplete) list of international resellers. This list includes Omnimap. Probably some of the domestic resellers also sell to foreign customers, so they might be your best bet. 

That brings back memories - the Troll Whillans was the first modern harness on the UK market and I bought one when they came out around 1970. I think I still have it in the shed. Before that, we improvised a harness by wrapping tape around our waist and thighs. As befits the hippy '60s, this was called a Swami Belt. The Whillans was tied on by passing the rope through two upper loops, tying it off with a bowline, and passing the active end of the rope through a crab clipped into the loop on the crotch strap. 

Basic navigation skills: the AT is a well-marked trail, but you still need to develop a sound grounding in navigation with map and compass. You may never need it but if you do it can be a life-safer - just a few years back there was a fatality when a lady missed the trail and become hopelessly lost. Too many people these days rely solely on their cellphone GPS. I was recently on a thread with some of the most experience thru-hikers on the planet, and all agreed that this is a terrible idea - she should be carrying map and compass and know how to use them. I recommend Lyle Brotherton's excellent Ultimate Navigation Manual as a resource, or she could do a course. The ability to deal with wet-cold: the AT is prone to some truly terrible weather, particularly in the White Mountains. There have been many incidents where people suffer from exposure and get into serious trouble. There's a skill to walking safely in bad weather in terms of equipment selection, management of pace, judging the conditions, selecting escape routes, erecting your shelter in a storm etc etc. There's no substitute for experience - encourage your mum to get out in bad weather over the winter to test her setup and gain confidence in her judgement. Obviously, this should be done in safe situations where it's easy to bail out. If there's a local mountaineering club she could hook up with them and learn from the old-timers. Walking ergonomics: very few people think about this. But there is a real skill to walking efficiently and without injury, especially up and down steep hills. And the AT is pretty much all steep hills! I learned much of what I know from watching the old guides in the Alps, but also from research and experimentation. Experienced walkers can quickly spot other seasoned hikers on the trail because they tend to walk more efficiently. It's too big a topic to go into here, but encourage her to research it, or go on a forum like BackpackingLight.com and ask for advice. On such a long walk this can make the difference between success and failure. Also, most people who carry walking poles have little idea how to use them - there's a technique and she should learn it. This helps preserve the knees of those of us past the first flush of youth...
