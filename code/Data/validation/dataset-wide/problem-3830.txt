A recurring theme in set-theoretic topology is the extension of results about compact spaces to Lindelof $P$-spaces (that is, Lindelof spaces where $G_\delta$ sets are open). This is because Lindelof $P$-spaces share with compact spaces many of the properties that are usually lost in Lindelof spaces (finite productivity, normality, etc...). There are several results of this kind scattered in the literature, and I think that Juhasz, Soukup, Szentmiklossy and Weiss are working on a systematic study, at least as far as cardinal invariants on Lindelof $P$-spaces are concerned. Three questions in increasing order of strength 

There might be a simpler way of proving this, but I could only think of this off the top of my head. Proof: By a theorem of Nogura ("Tightness of compact Hausdorff spaces and normality of products", J. Math. Soc. Japan 28, No. 2, 1976), the tightness of a space $X$ does not exceed $\kappa$ if and only if $X \times \kappa^+$ is normal, where $\kappa^+$ is provided with its natural order topology. So we just need to prove that $\beta D(\kappa) \times \kappa^+$ is not normal. To that aim, note first that $(\kappa^++1) \times \kappa^+$ is not normal (you can prove this directly or just use Nogura's theorem cited above). Now $\kappa^++1 \subset 2^{\kappa^+}$ and this last space has density $\kappa$, by the Hewitt-Marczewski-Pondiczery theorem. Let $f$ be any (necessarily continuous) bijection from $D(\kappa)$ to a dense subset $D$ of $2^{\kappa^+}$ such that $|D|=\kappa$. By Corollary 3.6.6 of Engelking's "General Topology" book, $f$ can be extended to a (necessarily perfect) map $F$ from $\beta D(\kappa)$ onto $2^{\kappa^+}$. Since product of perfect maps is perfect we obtain a perfect map from $\beta D(\kappa) \times \kappa^+$ onto $2^{\kappa^+} \times \kappa^+$, but this last space is not normal, because it contains the closed non-normal subspace $(\kappa^++1) \times \kappa^+$. Since normality is preserved by perfect maps, we get that $\beta D(\kappa) \times \kappa^+$ is not normal. 

Assuming you want $U_x$ to be a neighbourhood of $x$, your condition on $S$ is equivalent to $S$ being closed discrete, whenever $X$ is a regular space. That's because $X$ is regular if and only if for every point $x \in X$ and every open neighbourhood $U$ of $x$ there is an open set $V$ such that $x \in V \subset \overline{V} \subset U$. Now, there are plenty of regular ccc spaces with uncountable closed discrete subspaces. For example, let $\kappa$ be any uncountable cardinal and $X=\{x \in 2^\kappa: (\exists \beta < \kappa)(x(\beta)=1 \wedge (\forall \gamma>\beta)(x(\gamma)=0)) \}$ with the topology induced from the usual topology on $2^\kappa$. $X$ has the ccc as a dense subspace of the ccc space $2^\kappa$. For $\alpha < \kappa$ define a point $x_\alpha \in X$ as follows: $x_\alpha(\beta)=1$ for $\beta \leq \alpha$ and $x_\alpha(\beta)=0$, for $\beta > \alpha$. Then $D=\{x_\alpha: \alpha < \kappa \}$ is a closed discrete subspace of $X$ of cardinality $\kappa$. To see that, note that $\{[\sigma] \cap X: \sigma \in Fn(\kappa,2)\}$ is a base for $X$, where $Fn(\kappa,2)$ denotes the set of all finite partial functions from $\kappa$ to $2$ and $[\sigma]:=\{x \in 2^\kappa: \sigma \subset x\}$. We have $[\{(\alpha,1), (\alpha+1,0)\}] \cap D=\{x_\alpha\}$ for every $\alpha < \kappa$ and hence $D$ is discrete. Moreover, $D$ is closed because if $x \in X \setminus D$, then there are ordinals $\alpha, \beta < \kappa$, $\alpha < \beta$ such that $x(\alpha)=0$ and $x(\beta)=1$ and hence $[\{(\alpha,0), (\beta,1)\}]\cap X$ is an open neighbourhood of $x$ which misses $D$.

The result you want, I think, is in Stationarity, Isotropy and Sphericity in $l_p^*$. It is behind a pay-wall, but the form of the distribution is stated in the abstract. 

If you are interested in constructive distributions that you can simulate from (as opposed to something simpler with a known expression for the density) you have a lot of flexibility in constructing positive semi-definite matrices "from scratch". One popular way to do this is to use a "factor decomposition" which sets $$S = BB^t + \Psi$$ where $B$ is a $p$-by-$k$ matrix for $0 < k \leq p$ and $\Psi$ is a diagonal matrix with positive elements. A distribution on $S$ is induced by a distribution over the elements of $b_{ij}$ of $B$ and $\psi_{ii}$ of $\Psi$. One could draw the columns of $B$ to be orthogonal if desired (from say the Bingham-von-Mises-Fisher distribution). The recipe would be to 1.) draw $k$ between 0 and $p$ with some probabilities, 2.) draw $k$ columns of $B$, 3.) draw the elements of $\Psi$ iid and 4.) construct $S$. In this setting it seems like it would be easy to avoid the concentration phenomenon you note simply by modulating the distribution over $k$ and $\Psi$ as $p$ grows. 

The quantile alone is insufficient to define a maximum entropy density. Intuitively this is because the quantile is a single point and is not enough to prescribe an entire density; you must specify additional moments. A related fact is that quantiles are not sufficient statistics for any distributions on $\mathbb{R}$, as noted here on page 17. 

The intersection between computability theory and statistics is pretty interesting. From this paper by Vovk (2009): "It is widely accepted that advances in computing have brought about deep changes in the theory and practice of statistics. However, the use of the theory of computing, and, in particular, of its core notion of computability, has been very limited in the classical areas of statistics, such as parameter estimation and hypothesis testing." Relatedly, Ackerman, et al. (2011) demonstrate a computable random variable $(X,Y)$ with non-computable conditional distribution $P(Y \mid X)$. Certainly this area is pretty "mathy"; it remains to be seen if it has implications for statistical practice. 

Frank Tall proved that under $MA+\neg CH$ there is a regular first-countable space with caliber $\omega_1$ which is not separable. (see Tall, Franklin D., First countable spaces with caliber $\aleph_1$ may or may not be separable, Set-theor. Topol., Vol. dedic. to M.K. Moore, 353-358 (1977). ZBL0382.54003.) Applying the Moore Machine to Tall's example you get what you're looking for. 

In a recent MO post it was noted that Uspenskij's old example of a Tychonoff ccc space with a $G_\delta$ diagonal and arbitrarily large cardinality is not normal. See: How could I see quickly that this space is not normal? That made me wonder: 

All spaces are assumed to be Hausdorff. Recall that a cellular family in the space $X$ is a family of pairwise disjoint non-empty open subspaces of $X$. The cellularity of $X$ ($c(X)$) is defined as the supremum of the cardinalities of the cellular families in $X$. CCC means that the cellularity is countable. We say that a topological space $X$ is cellular-Lindelof if for every cellular family $\mathcal{C}$ there is a Lindelof subspace $Y$ of $X$ such that $U \cap Y \neq \emptyset$, for every $U \in \mathcal{C}$. Clearly every Lindelof space is cellular-Lindelof and every CCC space is cellular-Lindelof. The cellular-Lindelof property was introduced in our paper with Bella $URL$ where we note that: 

Then $S(\kappa)$ holds if and only if $\kappa$ is a regular cardinal. But things become more complicated if we just consider subsets of $\kappa$ of a fixed cardinality smaller than $\kappa$. For example, let $C(\kappa)$ be the statement: 

The answer to the first half of your question is no, though, at least consistently. Let $\mathbb{N}^*=\beta \mathbb{N} \setminus \mathbb{N}$ be the remainder of the Stone-Cech compactification of the integers. Under the Continuum Hypothesis, the set of all $P$-points is a dense subset of $\mathbb{N}^*$. But $\mathbb{N}^*$ has no dense meager subset. Indeed, let $\{N_n: n \in \mathbb{N} \}$ be a sequence of nowhere dense sets. Construct a decreasing sequence of open sets $\{U_n: n \in \mathbb{N} \}$ such that $U_n \cap D_n =\emptyset$ and $\overline{U_{n+1}} \subset U_n$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$. The set $\bigcap_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \overline{U_n}=\bigcap_{n \in \mathbb{N}} U_n$ is non-empty because of compactness. Moreover, every countable intersection of open subsets of $\mathbb{N}^*$ has non-empty interior (see, for example, Jan van Mill's chapter on $\beta \mathbb{N}$ in the Handbook of Set-theoretic Topology). Thus $Int(\bigcap_{n \in \mathbb{N}} U_n)$ is a non-empty open set missing every $N_n$ and hence $\bigcup_{n\in\mathbb{N}} N_n$ is not dense. 

I suggest taking a look at the work of Ulf Grenander. His 1963 book laid out the basis for applying probability theory to groups (Chapter 4 is on stochastic Lie groups) and other algebraic structures. He continued to develop these ideas (see his later book) in the context of pattern recognition. There is definitely newer work in this area (some of which is mentioned in other answers), but Grenander has been investigating these ideas for 40+ years and is worth looking into. As an aside, Grenander's approach seems to be a bit more formal than a lot of contemporary machine learning research, which is a strength or weakness according to the reader's taste. 

Suppose I am dead-set on using Bayesian inference on independent and identically distributed data, but I'm lazy and insist on using a parametric likelihood function come what may. I'd be reassured to know that as long as I stick to a particular class of parametric densities I can be sure to recover the true quantiles. Is there a recipe to construct a parametric family given a vector $q \in (0, 1)^k$ such that the inferred quantiles at $q_1, \dots, q_k$ line up with the true quantiles at those points? Here's my stab at formalizing this. 

I would make the problem sharper if I could, but the reason I want examples is precisely to help focus my thinking. I find it intriguing that it is not enough to have a well defined condition and a well defined model, one must also justify (by way of interpretation) which limit to take! I anticipate there are many examples from physics of which I am unaware and perhaps some from the literature on finite elements for solving PDEs. (Apologies for the pay-wall links.) 

Both of the penalties can be thought of as arising from the linear regression setting in a Bayesian framework with predictor matrix $K$ and a Gaussian prior over the vector $\alpha$, centered at zero with prior variance $V$. In the ridge regression case $V = n^{-1}\lambda^{-1}I$ and in the other case $V = n^{-1}\lambda^{-1}K^{-1}$ (as a kernel matrix $K$ is symmetric and PSD; I'm also assuming it is invertible). This follows just by equating terms; the posterior mean has the form $(K^tK + V^{-1})^{-1}K^tY$. Plugging in $V = n^{-1}\lambda^{-1}K^{-1}$ gives $$(K^tK + n\lambda K)^{-1}K^tY = (K^t + n\lambda I)^{-1}K^{-1}K^tY = (K + n\lambda I)^{-1}Y.$$ Anyway, this is all just definitions, but the perspective might be intuition-boosting: the RKHS version stipulates explicitly that the prior over alpha has higher precision (more regularization) along directions of high variation as defined by the kernel function. 

Ramiro, regarding 2), the set of all points in $I^\kappa$ with at most countably many non-zero coordinates is even Frechet-Urysohn, for every $\kappa$. This is due to Noble (see also exercise 3.10.D in Engelking). Note: Frechet-Urysohn means that given a non-closed set $A$ and a point $x \in \overline{A} \setminus A $, there is a sequence inside $A$ converging to $x$. 

An open neighbourhood assignment for a topological space $(X, \tau)$ is a map $U: X \to \tau$ such that $x \in U(x)$, for every $x \in X$. A space $X$ is called a $D$-space if for every open neighbourhood assignment $U$ there is a closed discrete set $D \subset X$ such that $X=\bigcup \{U(x): x \in D \}$. The famous $D$-space problem of van Douwen asks whether every regular Lindelof space is a D-space. 

Let $\theta$ be a large enough regular cardinal and $M \prec H(\theta)$ be a countably closed elementary submodel of $H(\theta)$ of cardinality $\mathfrak{c}$ such that $\mathfrak{c} \subset M$ and $\{Y, \tau, \mathcal{F}, \mathfrak{c}\} \subset M$. We claim that $\mathcal{F} \subset M$. Suppose this is not the case and let $K \in \mathcal{F} \setminus M$. Using compactness and regularity of $Y$, we can write every closed $G_\delta$ set $F \subset Y$ in the form $F=\bigcap \{\overline{V_n(F)}: n < \omega \}$, for a suitable decreasing family of open neighbourhoods $\{V_n(F): n < \omega \}$ of $F$. If $F \in \mathcal{F} \cap M$, then the family $\{V_n(F): n < \omega \}$ may be fixed in $M$, but then we actually have $\{V_n(F): n < \omega \} \subset M$. Note now that for every $x \in \overline{Y \cap M}$, we can find $F \in \mathcal{F} \cap M$ such that $x \in F$. Indeed, let $x \in \overline{Y \cap M} \setminus Y \cap M$. Then there is $F \in \mathcal{F}$ such that $x \in F$. Let $x_n$ be any point of $U_n(F) \cap Y \cap M$. Using compactness of $F$ and the fact that $F=\bigcap \{\overline{U_n(F)}: n <\omega \}$ we can easily see that the sequence $\{x_n: n < \omega \}$ converges to $F$, in the sense that, every open neighbourhood of $F$ contains a final segment of $\{x_n: n < \omega \}$. Now by $\omega$-closedness of $M$, we have that $\{x_i: i \geq n \} \in M$, for every $n<\omega$ and hence the set: $$\mathcal{S}=\{K \in \mathcal{F}: \{x_n: n <\omega \} \rightarrow K \}$$ is an element of $M$ (the formula defining that set has all free variables in $M$). Note that since every compact Hausdorff space is normal, $F$ can be separated from a closed set disjoint from it by a pair of disjoint open sets. Therefore, we have that if $G \in \mathcal{S}$ then $G \cap F \neq \emptyset$. Hence $|\mathcal{S}| \leq 2^{\aleph_0}$ by assumption. But then we actually have that $\mathcal{S} \subset M$ and hence $F \in M$, as we wanted. For every $F \in \mathcal{F} \cap M$ we have $\{H \in \mathcal{F} : F \cap H \neq \emptyset \} \in M$, and, since $|\{H \in \mathcal{F} : F \cap H \neq \emptyset \}| \leq \mathfrak{c}$, we also have $\{H \in \mathcal{F} : F \cap H \neq \emptyset \} \subset M$. So, for every $F \in \mathcal{F} \cap M$, we have $F \cap K=\emptyset$. Now, by compactness of $K$, we can find for every $F \in \mathcal{F} \cap M$, an integer $n <\omega$ such that $\overline{U_n(F)} \cap K=\emptyset$. Thus for every $x \in \overline{Y \cap M}$, we can find an open neighbourhood $U_x \in M$ of $x$ such that $U_x \cap K=\emptyset$. Now $\mathcal{U}=\{U_x: x \in \overline{Y \cap M} \}$ is an open cover of the compact space $\overline{Y \cap M}$ such that $\mathcal{U} \subset M$. So there is a finite set $\mathcal{G} \subset \mathcal{U}$ such that $\overline{Y \cap M} \subset \bigcup \mathcal{G}$. This implies that $M \models Y \subset \bigcup \mathcal{G}$ and hence $H(\theta) \models Y \subset \bigcup \mathcal{G}$. But this contradicts $K \cap \bigcup \mathcal{G}=\emptyset$. So $\mathcal{F} \subset M$ and hence $|\mathcal{F}| \leq |M| \leq \mathfrak{c}$.
