It's anecdotal and a sample size of just one, but a good friend in high-school suffered from cystic fibrosis. He smoked from a stated firm belief that the smoke relieved the mucous build up. As he wasn't expected to live much past 30 anyways, lung cancer was the least of his concerns. As it was he lived to the ripe old age (for a CF sufferer) of 42. 

In contrast, few if any senior members of the new Liberal party thought or referred to themselves as Whigs. The name rapidly fell out of fashion in Great Britain though it continues in popular use in Canada to refer to the Federal Liberal Party. 

John D. Rockefeller Sr. was far and away the richest man in the world in 1937 at his death. But with the bulk of his wealth bequeathed to the Rockefeller (and other) foundations rather than to his son John D. Jr., that probably leaves Henry Ford the world's richest man in 1939. However Ford had suffered a number of strokes in the late 1930's, and when he resumed active direction of the company in 1943 after Edsel's death, gross mismanagement led to horrendous monthly losses and his ouster in 1945. As the largest customer of the Ford Motor Company during those years was undoubtedly the American military, one might almost say that despite his virulent and infamous anti-Semitism, Ford personally financed a more rapid defeat of Nazi Germany. There are numerous lists on the web listing the Wealthiest persons in history, all with slightly varying estimates of the order and composition, but all place Ford high on the list. The contemporaries who contested his position - Vanderbilt, Carnegie, Mellon, and Rockefeller - had all preceded him to the grave, bequeathing their vast fortunes to foundations. Here is the very first Forbes Rich List, from 1918, which lists the richest 30 Americans of that date. It is very likely that the wealthiest individuals up to the early 1950's can trace much of their wealth back to this list, due to the world-wide effect of the Great Depression and the accompanying deflation. 

The above suggests that Wikipedia might have reversed the exchange rates between the Swedish Reichstaler and the French Livre in their research. This source states the value as being 400,000 ecus per year, for five years: 

Although Euclid is renowned for his compilation of the axioms and theorems of plane geometry, most if not all of this material had been known for centuries. With these mathematical tools, and the use of strings and simple pedometers and protractors, remarkably accurate maps could be drawn by the ancients for territories that were relatively level and pace-able on foot. Even in land-locked territories, it seems likely that early mapmakers would have realized that the Earth is not flat from the observation that the angles of a triangle increase slowly and progressively beyond the 180 degrees predicted from planar geometry. (These simple tools, in an advanced form, remained in use by surveyors for thousands of years, as the surveyors chain and theodolite, until recently replaced by GPS and modern digital devices.) With the development of magnetic compasses (to determine North) and sextants and astrolabes (for measuring latitude) larger territories could be mapped. If you look at maps from the early Age of Exploration you will see many maps that in some ways look remarkably accurate, while simultaneously looking distorted to our modern eye. Part of this distortion results from the longitude problem that wasn't fully resolved until the mid-18th century with the final award of the Longitude Prize by the British Admiralty. In a nutshell, the problem was to determine with accuracy how far east or west one was from a known point (London for British sailors). While the sextant and astrolabe allowed one to determine one's latitude (degrees south or north of equator) with great accuracy, no equivalent method for determining longitude existed at that time. If one was on level land various techniques could be used to estimate a value, but onyly with the invention of the maritime chronometer could longitude be calculated accurately on land and sea. In the decades after this invention, probably sparked further both by William Smith's first geologic map of England and the Napoleonic Wars, many national governments began comprehensive topological mapping of their domains for military and civilian use. In the early decades of the 19th century, for example, Bavaria's Mad King Ludwig continued the mapping initiative begun by his father, of having all of Bavaria mapped at 1:50,000 scales, and all significant towns and villages mapped at 1:2000 1:2500 scale. As trains, planes, and automobiles enabled more people to easily journey further from regions they knew well, road- and trail-maps became increasingly popular and inexpensive, resulting in the great popularity of municipal air-photo maps in the 1960's, with every house marked by a small black rectangle. Update: Wikipedia has good articles on Cartographic Projections 

There isn't, and never has been, a French equivalent of the Victorian Era in the sense of moral rigidity and the dominance of the bourgeoisie. As evidence I submit the concept of the French Postcard (warning - adult content beyond link) which nearly every Victorian gentleman traveling on the Continent would send to his male friends for their amusement. The very concept of a Victorian Age in this sense is a Northern European, Puritanical, and very Anglo-Saxon concept essentially incompatible with Catholic Gallic culture. The distinction revolves around a fundamental difference between the theology and practice of the Roman Catholic church which historically pervades Gallic culture, and the Calvinist theology and practice which periodically has pervaded Anglo-Saxon culture. (Cromwell's time as Lord Protector and the latter part of Victoria's reign being two notable examples.) According to (Roman) Catholic theology, everyone sins; provided one confesses, performs the designated penance, and subsequently receives mass all is well, and one is welcome into the Kingdom of Heaven. This becomes so habitual historically that many perform it as a weekly ritual. According to Calvinist theology, where there is no concept of Free Will, one's right to salvation in the Kingdom of Heaven is pre-ordained in terms of who you are, not what you have or not done. This further requires that in order to maintain one's status as one of the chosen one must be perpetually observant, and as everyone is their brother's keeper everyone must also be perpetually observant that everyone else is also perpetually observant of the strictest moral precepts.

The given year identifies when the name was first applied, the species of course having been then identified as distinct, and the name is of the authority who made the identification and (usually) coined the name according to Binomial Nomenclature of Biological Classification. It is quite common for the modern Binomial Names for species to be derived from Latin and/or Greek roots, and this was adhered to even more strictly in the early 19th century than it is now. It is almost certain that the Genus name Sandracottus was chosen to honour Chandragupta; was there a beetle motif associated with Chandragupta perhaps, that Illiger might have been aware of?
