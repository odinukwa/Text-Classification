Actually no one knows what '666' stands for. There is no evidence that it has some connection to Roman numeral, but not, say, Greek (or Jewish) numeral. Thus there are dozens of guesses, but no single answer. Some examples to produce '666' are: 

Quite easy to recall the siege of Tunis, 1270 by Louis IX during 8th Crusade. Also 5th siege of Gibraltar in 1349-1350, where Alfonso XI died of that very same "black death". In both cases the besiegers heavily suffered of epidemies and had no success. 

Napoleon's initial objective was defeating Russian army in a border battle. Immediately after that he was planning to start negotiations and, among other things, to restore the alliance with Russia. Neither Moscow, nor St.Petersburg were of any use for him. On the other hand, Alexander I considered the possibility of losing both St.Petersburg and Moscow from the very beginning. And the plan would remain absolutely same. Still being in Smolensk Napoleon tried to start peace talks, but had no success. Then he must have realized that the things didn't go as planned, and Russia was ready for a long war of attrition. And even capturing, say, St.Petersburg would change nothing. So he took his chance in pursuing Russian army and forcing it into battle. Napoleon expected that public opinion wouldn't let Russian army to retreat forever. But, as we know, the battle of Borodino gave him nothing except abandoned city of Moscow. He tried to start peace talks several times, but had no answer at all. Thus going to St.Petersburg instead of Moscow in the beginning of the war would let Napoleon to retreat from Russia easily, that's true. But he sought for a chance to win, and capturing St.Petersburg was totally useless from this point of view. 

More specifically, a couple of passages from the book American Commando: Evans Carlson, His WWII Marine Raiders, and America's First Special Forces Mission by John F. Wukovits speak to the hesitation of the Marines to even allow him to re-enlist (p17): 

The last section is typical of the attitude of the Romans (and very similar to colonizing powers throughout history), as it portrays Rome itself as the source of civilization. Simply put, the closer to the influence of Roman culture, the more civilized the population. By further comparison to the comparative cultural merits of the Gauls and Germans, he notes in chapter 31 (my emphasis): 

I think you are forgetting that the inflation rate during WWI was staggering. The consumer price index at the end of the war was extremely high, and the deflation that you are referring to can be seen as more of a adjustment in pricing back toward pre-war levels. In fact the CPI was relatively flat through the 20s as a 10 year moving average: 

Such concern likely existed, and there is evidence of some cursory discussion to that effect during the proceedings of the Continental Congress. The rationale for creating a federal district with sole jurisdiction of the Congress was probably laid out best (among the surviving documents) by James Madison: 

That could be an option if the sides were not on the equal terms. Say, if you have to show your loyalty to the conditions of some peace treaty after an unsuccessful war, then sending such "a hostage" may save you a couple of fortresses. After all, girls need husbands. On the other hand, if you are on equal terms, then by this marriage you make another monarch to owe you. And this could be of much help, say, if you have both a daughter and a son. 

1917-1920 is the time of the Revolution and the Russian Civil War. It was the time of disorder, hunger and, among other things, collapse of public utilities. The population of Moscow almost halved then. As for residential heating, people certainly had to use woods, but if only they could get them. In 1920s Moscow started to grow at a very fast rate, and the utilities were constantly falling behind in development. So your situation could be very different depending on where exactly you live. Here is the poetical witness from 1935, the excerpt from the poem for children by Sergey Mikhalkov "And how's yours?" (it's about the children chatting about their families and housing issues): 

The following passage from Incidents of Travel in Central America, Chiapas and Yucatan would lend some credence to the first two explanations of remarkable discoveries of a fallen civilization: 

In 1774 James Cook gives a slightly different picture, noting that while he didn't see abundant surplus, it was attributable to the extent that crops were planted and the amount of labor involved. He also comments on the apparent lack of fishing as a food source given the low abundance in the coastal waters. What is conspicuously missing is any characterization of the population as undernourished. 

The Lexington had been taken prize by the British on September 19th, and was put up for repairs in Dover shortly before the loss of Reprisal, as noted in The Public Advertiser (London), 3 October 17772: 

The Hunt and Lipo Late Arrival Hypothesis You can get a little better understanding of the hypothesis put forward in the article linked to in the question in this Terry Hunt's 2006 paper in American Scientist3. Much of the hypothesis put forward in The Statues That Walked stems from the conclusion that Hunt puts forward in that paper - that the settlement of Easter Island occurred much later than previously claimed (this effects population growth estimates and rate of deforestation). This claim is rejected (with the requisite amount of academic politeness) by quite a few others in the field based on what they see as flaws in Hunt's methodology. Bahn and Flenley write in their broadside rebuttal of the book that; 

Talking specifically about Syria after Crassus death, Cassius had to take care of the province for about next two years. The new proconsul - well-known Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus who was consul in 59 B.C. together with Ceasar - was sent only in 51 B.C. But this should be considered as an absolutely critical situation (e.g. in 52 B.C. Pompeus Magnus was consul sine collega). Under normal circumstances the senate would find the new candidate much earlier. 

The most detailed map, I was able to find, is here. As you can see both "pockets" at the time of a surrender had area of only a few square kilometers. However, by the 25th January (the last day the 6th German army had a continuous front line) the area under German control was still upto 100 square kilometers. In the morning of the 26th January the Red army started the new wave of a massive offence along the whole front line, which not only resulted in the occupying of the Mamayev Kurgan and nearby territories (which effectively meant that the German XI corps wasn't longer connected to the rest of the army - "Northern pocket"), but also led to other significant advances, so the area under German control was almost halved at the end of the day. Nonetheless, the fierce fights were going for at least four days more - 27-30 January. "South" (Paulus) capitulated on the 31st January, while holding only few blocks in the city center. "North" (Strecker) still resisted, so it was set under heavy artillery fire until the surrender (2nd February). 

Image credit NASA Take a look at the topographical lines around Coats Land - the ascent to the Antarctic Plateau is more difficult from the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf than it is from the Ross Ice Shelf. It doesn't look that bad on the map, but there is roughly a 10,000ft (~3000m) elevation difference from the ice shelves to the Plateau. The second reason was that the Weddell Sea is extremely inhospitable compared to the relative calmness of the Ross Sea. To borrow Thomas R. Henry's quotation from Wikipedia: 

...it seems like this has been repeated in quite a few other secondary sources in a context of advocating genocide. I'll defer judgment of whether this was taken out of context to the reader. 

Much of the work he did on The History of Liberty has been published in various essays and collections, but his opus was never completed. 1 Boyd, Kelly. Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing, Volume 1, p. 1 2 Smith, George H. Lord Acton and the History of Liberty, Part 1, online 

To further complicate matters, archaeology isn't the only tool for tracking population movements. Bellwood offers linguistic changes in the region as another piece of evidence that supports incredibly rapid movement. 

There could be a few functioning ATMs somewhere between 1988 and 1991 (different sites point at different years without a proof), but significant numbers of ATMs appeared only after breakup of the USSR. Sberbank claims it has functioning ATMs in Moscow since 1993 - seems like the earliest date. 

Normally, there was no sense in adopting girls. There are only two known examples, and both took place under very specific circumstances. 

First of all, helots were "light infantries" only, at least until Brasidas' campaign. So spartan hoplits could defeat them in a direct clash: until Iphikrates light infantries had no tactic against heavy phalanx, no matter if helots outnumbered spartans as 7:1. But why they never tried to betray spartans in the battle seems really strange. Of course, some helots may hope to deserve a freedom, but there couldn't be too many of them. It seems that the most popular guess is that the helots of Laconia had some privileges over the helots of Messenia (kind of "home slaves" vs. "rustic slaves"), and only privileged helots could be soldiers in the army of Sparta. 

Nothing, in 1991 he was already 70 years old. He laid in the hospital. From the interview in Komsomolskaya Pravda, 2011 

According to the Wikipedia article on Trinity, the estimated yield of the device was between 18 and 20 kilotons from a 6.2 kg plutonium 239 core. Complete fission of Pu-239 yields 19 kilotons per kilogram, giving an efficiency of somewhere between 15% and 17%. 

Escape attempts at Elmira seemed to be fairly common from what I find. One account describes the punishment for prisoners caught in escape attempts, and implies that tunneling was a common way to wind up there.

Religion as a motivation for Armstrong's solo visit is very unlikely. Armstrong was actually the 2nd U.S. Astronaut that travelled to the Soviet Union - the first was Frank Borman, who arrived in Moscow on July 2nd, 1969 after being invited by the U.S.S.R. Institute for Soviet-American Relations.1 Borman was among the more religious of the Apollo astronauts, and the Soviets certainly can't have missed his reading of Genesis when Apollo 8 was orbiting the Moon on December 24, 1968. Like Borman, Armstrong was not invited by the Soviet government - his visit was arranged through the International Council of Scientific Unions' Committee on Space Research (COSPAR). Armstrong was part of a delegation of 32 American scientists and NASA officials2 and was ostensibly there to present a paper titled "Lunar Surface Exploration" at the 13th COSPAR conference in Leningrad May 20th through May 29th, 1970 (which he also subsequently presented at a conference in Berlin the next year).3 The official Soviet government response to his visit was a luke-warm, and it took 5 days after his arrival to get permission to visit the Kremlin.4 Most likely, Armstrong's visit was a natural result of the attempts of the heads of both the U.S. and Soviet scientific communities to develop a more cooperative relationship than had characterized the early space race. Several months prior to Armstrong's trip to Leningrad, Thomas O. Paine (Administer of NASA at the time) had sent his counterpart at the Soviet Academy of Sciences Mstislav Keldysh a copy of two reports on the possibility of creating a more cooperative relationship between the two agencies. 

I believe it's rather a Zeitgeist. Soviet writers in 1920s were quite ingenious in arms "development". Belyaev in "Master of the World" used powerful mental weapon, A.N.Tolstoy in "Engineer Garin's Hyperboloid" projected a kind of laser weapon and so on. "Electric revolvers" in Bulgakov's story are much more powerful than modern samples: a multi-charged pistol capable of "killing anything alive in the circle of 2 meter in diameter" would have become a "must have" tool in modern warfare. 

In reality the West still seriously depends for Titanium on Russia. The main reason is pure economics. Titanium has a very high cost price, so Boeing may take a bit, but you may be sure that GM would never want it (unless a cheap technological process of making Titanium is invented). So to establish Titanium production you have not only to invest a vast sum of money in a hi-tech factory, but also to convince a few big companies, such as Boeing or Airbus, that they should break existing contracts and buy your stuff. How much profit do you expect to make from this? Capitalism doesn't work like this, but Soviet Socialism did. So Soviet Union once made the largest Titanium production which still holds the biggest market share. 

Note that this does not use the Articles of Confederation as the legal basis of the decision - it uses arguments based on the Constitution. You can read the full decision of the court here - Wikipedia pulls a couple of quotations out of context. 

A couple modern authors note that his politics were a strain on his career, such as this passage from Fighting Elites: A History of U.S. Special Forces by John C. Fredriksen (p101): 

However, the preponderance of materials I could find gave his age at 15. Note that this is the youngest that I can find substantiating record of. The database at deathpenaltyusa.org lists an unnamed white male executed for arson in Suffolk County, Massachusetts in 1837 at the age of 13, but I can't find any source material that would corroborate that. EDIT: In response to the edited question, the youngest person (and certainly the youngest female) generally believed to have been legally executed in the United States is Hannah Ocuish, executed at age 12 in Connecticut in 1786. Note that the deathpenaltyusa.org site linked about records 2 other 12 year olds executed, both black slaves, a boy in Virginia by the name of Clem on 5/11/1787 and another boy named Bill on 7/30/1791. In the latter case, there seems to be a disagreement on the location. I'm guessing that the LA Times is the more accurate account.3 1 Radelet, Michael ed. Facing the Death Penalty: Essays on a Cruel and Unusual Punishment, p 52 2 Morning Examiner. (Bartlesville, Okla.), Vol. 15, No. 46, Ed. 1 Saturday, April 9, 1910, p 3 3 Los Angeles Times. Death for Juvenile Crimes : Execution, a Practice Dating to 1642, May Continue This Week, January 07, 1986 p online 

Definitely not. The situation on the southern front was highly dangerous, and such significant reinforcement potentially could make the difference. Again, in Soviet and Russian historiography there's a strong believe that the battle on the northern front, albeit unsuccessful, helped to hold the southern front. 

As the reasons of the latter they usually say of treason, incest and patricide. Yet note that the term "treason" (or, to say it right, "perduellio") was quite a special thing - it was a crime against the state and the order, not just "a treachery" in a modern sense. Livius I, 26 

Damn, that was a huge problem for all Soviet people - almost nothing worked on sundays. Seven days a week? Forget it. 

Here Livius says about early Republic hero Publius Horatius who killed his sister. As she was a free citizen, then public murdering without a lawful reason was considered as a crime against the Roman state itself! On the matter of "patricide" and the punishment for it called Poena cullei, it's better to read the corresponding article in Wiki, which is quite comprehensive: $URL$ 

That was UK vs. USSR athletics competition similar to ones USA vs. USSR. Not much info about it, as it was obviously cancelled. This is interview with Nina Ponomaryova published on 6th February, 2015 by Russian magazine "Sport-Express". When asked about that incident she said the following:
