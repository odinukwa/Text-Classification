That was a large part of the subject of my 1964 PhD thesis. While the motivation came from algebraic topology, the relevant algebra was published separately in the paper $URL$ It is very obvious from the case of abelian restricted Lie algebras with zero restriction what the minimal size of a $V(L)$-projective resolution of the ground field $k$ can be, where $L$ is a restricted Lie algebra with enveloping algebra $V(L)$. Section 6 of that paper constructs a resolution $X(L)$ of that minimal size for any $L$, using the theory of twisted tensor products. The serious part of the mathematics is to construct a coproduct on $X(L)$ suitable for computing $Ext_{V(L)}^*(k,k)$ as an algebra. In characteristic $2$, the coproduct is coassociative and very explicit, as explained in Remarks 10, op cit, and $X(L)$ embeds into the bar constuction via a map of differential coalgebras. In char $p>2$, the price one pays for minimal size is that the coproduct is defined inductively and is not coassociative. The embedding into the bar construction is then only compatible with coproducts up to homotopy. The paper also gives a spectral sequence for computing the restricted Lie algebra cohomology from the cohomology of the underlying Lie algebra; that eases calculations and minimizes the difficulty caused by the cited non-coassociativity. 

What category are you working in? Operads are definable in any symmetric monoidal category. They always have associated monads in that category such that the categories of algebras over the operad and monad are isomorphic. That relationship between operads and monads motivated my coining of the word "operad'', back in 1971. The original definition was for spaces, but Max Kelly and I understood the general situation right away. It is rare and special that the monad arising from an operad is cartesian, so it is not true that ``from every operad arises a cartesian monad''. Incidentally, it is not only true that different operads can have the same associated monad, it is also true that the same operad can have different associated monads in different categories. For example, an operad $\mathcal{C}$ in spaces with $\mathcal C(0)$ a point has a monad in unbased spaces and a quite different monad in based spaces with isomorphic categories of algebras. With my original definition of an operad, not every cartesian monad arises from an operad. For a perhaps esoteric example, consider the monad in the category of globular sets that defines strict $\omega$-categories. 

There are several different, provably equivalent, definitions. Construction 10 in $URL$ is one example. It is used to prove the uniqueness of a machine taking permutative categories to spectra. Therefore, any two reasonable constructions of $\Gamma$-categories from permutative categories give rise to equivalent spectra. Section 3 of Segal's original paper ``Categories and cohomology theories'' gives examples, but it is unclear whether you are asking for examples of permutative categories (plentiful since any small symmetric monoidal category is equivalent to a permutative category) or of examples of different constructions of the associated $\Gamma$-category. One different, more categorical construction, is given in Theorem 3.4 of $URL$ (I should apologize for referring to my old papers since there are many other sources; that is just quickest for me.) 

On page 21 of the cited paper of May, $\mathcal{T}$ is defined to be the category of nondegenerately based spaces, but he inconsiderately fails to say that that convention remains in place in Section 15. With that convention, as he also fails to say but is true, the right adjoint ($\Omega_*$ in the question, $S$ in May) takes values in May's category $\mathcal{S}^+\mathcal{T}$ of special proper simplicial based spaces and all is well. 

I suppose I should try to answer since the question of whether or not $BP$ is an $E_{\infty}$ ring spectrum was Problem 1 of "Problems in infinite loop space theory'', $URL$ written in 1974, two years after $E_{\infty}$ ring spectra were first defined. At the time, we were hoping for some good way of starting from the relevant group law and manufacturing $BP$ from it. The example "in nature'' that led to the definition of $E_{\infty}$ ring spectra was $MU$, so it was impossible not to be intrigued by the question. Some things proven since with $MU$ might be streamlined if we could start with $BP$, such as the construction of Morava $K$-theory. However, Basterra and Mandell proved that $BP$ is an $E_4$-spectrum, compatibly with $MU$, which is enough for such applications. I'm still intrigued by the question, although I admit to having no applications in mind. 

The Eilenberg-Moore spectral sequence can be understood as a parametrized K\"unneth theorem. There is a monograph (also a paper) by L. Smith giving this approach (Lectures on the EMSS, Springer LNM 134, 1970). Section 22.7 of $URL$ gives a new conceptual construction and a long list of relevant references. 

Let $I$ be the kernel of $\epsilon\colon A\to k$. Filter $A$ by the powers of $I$. If $A$ is a Hopf algebra, then the associated graded algebra $E^0A$ is a primitively generated Hopf algebra. If the characteristic of $k$ is zero, $E^0A$ is isomorphic to the universal enveloping algebra of its Lie algebra of primitive elements. By the Poincar\'e-Birkhof-Witt (PBW) theorem, the associated graded algebra of $E^0A$ with respect to its Lie filtration is isomorphic (when regraded by total degree) to the free commutative algebra on the primitive elements of $E^0A$, which is a polynomial algebra (assuming the $A$ you start out with is ungraded, or graded and concentrated in even degrees). Thus $A$ is two filtrations away from a polynomial algebra, which gives a significant restriction on the underlying vector space of $A$. If $k$ has positive characteristic $p$, the same argument applies with Lie algebra replaced by restricted Lie algebra, but of course the conclusion of the PBW theorem gives much less complete information, depending on the restriction ($p$th power operation). 

When I wrote the comment above, my memory was blanking. The connection between ring maps $MU\to R$ and complex orientations that Mark describes goes back to Quillen's original work relating $MU$ to formal group laws. (Lemma 4.6, page 52, in Adams Stable Homotopy and Generalized Cohomology characterizes ring maps $MU\to R$ in terms of complex orientations). A discussion of $E_{\infty}$ orientations $MU\to R$ that may help with the original question is given in Section 5 of ``What are $E_{\infty}$ ring spaces good for?'', which relates spectrum level orientations to $E_{\infty}$ orientations on the space level. Such orientations are equivalent to $E_{\infty}$ maps $BU \to B(U;R)$, where $B(U;R)$ classifies $R$-oriented $U$-bundles (in the classical sense of orientation). I apologize if the relevance is unclear. It's late. [Continued] Here is some more background. To understand the mathematics here, you must recognize that the unit space once called $F$ and now called $GL_1(S)$ plays two very different roles, one additive and one multiplicative. This is explained in the introduction to "What are $E_{\infty}$ ring spaces good for?" The space $BF$ classifies sectioned stable spherical fibrations, and its product classifies fiberwise smash products. You go from stable vector bundles to stable spherical fibrations by fiberwise one point compactification, and that takes Whitney sum of bundles to fiberwise smash product. Therefore we think of this as additive structure. The map $BU \rightarrow BF$ sees this on the represented functor level, and it is maps like this that you are thinking of as leading to Thom spectra (as they do by Gaunce Lewis's thesis, in "Equivariant stable homotopy theory" LMS 1213. There is also an infinite loop space $BU_{\otimes}$, which is the identity component of the space $GL_1(KU)$. There is no analogous $BF_{\otimes}$. As the unit space $GL_1(S)$, we think of the same space $F$ as multiplicative. For any commutative (ie $E_{\infty}$) ring spectrum $R$, we have the unit map $S\to R$, and on passage to zeroth spaces it induces an infinite loop map $GL_1(S) \rightarrow GL_1(R)$. There is a fibration sequence $B(U,R) \to BU \to BGL_1(R)$. The first map says ``forget the orientation''. The second is the obstruction to (universal) $R$-orientability of complex vector bundles. An $E_{\infty}$ $R$-orientation of complex bundle theory is an $E_{\infty}$ map $g\colon BU \to B(U,R)$ which sections $B(U,R) \to BU$. Such orientations $g$ correspond to maps $MU\to R$ of commutative ring spectra, as I explained in Section 5 opus cit. Of course, everything in this general theory works equally well for other kinds of bundles. The interplay of additive and multiplicative structure is the key to the splitting of $SF$ as $J\times Coker J$ at each prime $p$ (only an $E_{\infty}$ splitting when $p$ is odd). 

In that range of dimensions one can cheat, as I did in my 1964 thesis. That is available on MathSciNet, and the differentials are penciled in on page A.2 (near the end). It was an easy exercise then to deduce the differentials algebraically as the only ones consistent with Toda's calculations of the homotopy groups slightly beyond that range, from 1962. There is a nice fun contrast made between calculating Ext and calculating differentials in Adams' 1961 Berkeley lecture notes. As evidence that your question is not trivial, Adams had a mistake in the differentials, in the range of your question if my memory is correct, which I pointed out to him in the first of hundreds of letters between us. His answer was that he didn't have Toda's calculations in front of him when he wrote that. As far as I know, there are no systematic methods known to guarantee complete information. One uses the algebra structure to deduce differentials from known calculations wherever possible. One uses relations between Massey products and Toda brackets to deduce some differentials, and one uses relations between Steenrod operations and their homotopical analogues to deduce others. Some systematic discussion is in Bruner's contribution to "$H_{\infty}$ ring spectra and their applications'' and there are many more recent sources. 

Looks to me as if you have not used the product of your Hopf algebra, and it looks to me that you have written an example of a cotorsion product, as defined by Eilenberg and Moore in their paper Homology and fibrations I. Coalgebras, cotensor product and its derived functors. Comm. Math. Hel. 40(1965), 199--236, available here: $URL$ 

In view of the references to my Memoir, Classifying spaces and fibrations, in other answers, I guess I should answer too. The requested answer is implicit but not quite explicit there. Fix a grouplike topological monoid $G$. Maybe assume for simplicity that its identity element is a nondegenerate basepoint (no loss of generality by 9.3). Define a $G$-torsor to be a right $G$-space $X$ such that the $G$-map $G\longrightarrow X$ that sends $g$ to $xg$ is a weak equivalence for $x\in X$. Let $\mathcal{G}$ be the category of $G$-torsors and maps of $G$-spaces between them. The Memoir defines a $\mathcal{G}$-fibration in terms of the $\mathcal{G}$-CHP, which is equivalent to having a $\mathcal{G}$-lifting function. Cary asks whether that notion is equivalent to an a priori weaker notion. The answer depends on what ``equivalence'' means. The Memoir insists on $\mathcal{G}$-fibrations, but it defines an equivalence (6.1) to be a $\mathcal{G}$-map over the base space, where a $\mathcal{G}$-map only has to be a map of $G$-torsors on fibers. (More precisely, it takes the equivalence relation generated by such maps.) Using $\mathcal{G}$-fibrations allows one often to replace that notion of equivalence by the nicer one of $\mathcal{G}$-fiber homotopy equivalence. But with the equivalence relation as given, any $\mathcal{G}$-map that is a quasifibration is equivalent to a $\mathcal{G}$-fibration, by the $\Gamma$-construction in Section 5. Therefore the classification theorem remains true allowing all $\mathcal{G}$-spaces that are quasifibrations, which of course includes Cary's preferred notion of a $G$-fibration. 

Pages 75-81 of Appendix A of ``On the theory and applications of differential torsion products'', Memoirs AMS 142 (1974), by V.K.A.M. Gugenheim and myself, gives a detailed treatment of the $W$-construction for simplicial augmented algebras over a commutative ring $R$. Not the answer to your question, but if I remember rightly, it should lift to an answer when suitably specialized; more precisely, the chain homotopy of Lemma A.16 (up to signs coming from variant choices) should specialize to one coming from a contracting homotopy as desired. When $G$ is a group regarded as a constant simplicial group, Lemma A.15 lifts to give an isomorphism between $WG$ and the simplicial set $E_*G$ whose realization is $EG$. 

Tom's comment gives a generic answer that applies to $Top^\mathcal{J}$ for any small topological category $\mathcal{J}$. For the orbit category $\mathcal{O}_G$, where $G$ is any discrete group (not necessarily finite), something special and much nicer happens. We have the fixed point functor $\Phi$ from $G$-spaces to $\mathcal{O}_G$-spaces. It sends $X$ to the functor on the orbit category that sends $G/H$ to $X^H$. The functor $\Phi$ actually specifies an isomorphism from the category of $G$-cell complexes (or the category of $G$-CW complexes) to the category of cell diagrams or (CW diagrams) in the diagram category of $\mathcal{O}_G$-spaces. Modulo a few obvious typos, the easy proof is given on page 56 of Equivariant Homotopy and Cohomology Theory (by some of my friends and me), CBMS Regional Conference Series in Mathematics Number 91, AMS 1996. That book is posted on my web page ($URL$ The cofibrations are the retracts of the relative cell diagrams. 

I just noticed this question, so my apologies for a very belated answer. Proposition 20.5.5 of $URL$ states that a $k$-orientation of a spherical fibration $X$ over a base space $B$ specifies a $k$-trivialization of $X$. Here $k$ is any (homotopy) commutative ring spectrum, and the notion of a $k$-orientation is the standard one. However, a $k$-trivialization is an equivalence $k\wedge X\simeq k\wedge S^n_B$ of parametrized spectra over $B$. Intuitively, after smashing with $k$ over $B$, $X$ thinks that it is the trivial fibration $B \times S^n \to B$.The Thom isomorphism follows directly. 

I'm lousy at point-set topology, always was, but I don't see that $X$ is closed in $X\wedge I_+$. This is the sort of question a working algebraic topologist does not want to think about. Cofibrant approximation in the $h$-model structure on $\mathcal{U}_{*}$ takes $X$ to the whiskered space $X\vee I$ with new basepoint at $1$ if the basepoint of $I$ is taken to be $0$. If $X$ has a nasty degenerate basepoint, take the nasty thing away: I do not want to think about it.
