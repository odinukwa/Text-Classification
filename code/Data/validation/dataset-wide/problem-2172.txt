Roughly speaking, charging company $x/hr on a contract is the same as getting half that as an employee. Employees get statutory holidays paid (I think there are 14 a year in Quebec?), vacation of at least 4%, perhaps more, sick days, benefits, paid training, and are paid even when there's nothing to do. Contractors get none of that and may not even be paid for all the hours they work - if you tell someone a trailer is 10 hours work, you will almost certainly only be able to bill them 10 hours even if it ends up taking you 20 - especially if it's your mistake that causes the extra time. And you need to spend time doing accounting, preparing invoices, company tax returns, and so on. You need to kick in both parts of EI and CPP, or perhaps your hours spent on this won't count towards EI and CPP (you need professional advice on this, and you have to pay for that sort of thing out of your bill rate too.) So if your salary was $15 you would need to bill them a minimum of $30/hr to be equivalent. Do you want to be equivalent? Some people would think you need more than you used to make, to make it worth your while. I don't know what you'd be doing with your evenings and weekends if you weren't moonlighting for your old employer. Watching TV pays $0/hr. Drinking with your buddies pays a negative amount per hour, because you have to pay for your drinks. Will this work make you better? Will it make you better known? Could you end up a trailer-maker for all kinds of shops? Is that something you want? Is doing it a step forward? Will it jeopardize your "day job"? Will it cause tension in your home life? Will you spend more on takeout food or paying for services (taxis, cleaning service, dog walker) because you have less time? Only you can juggle all of that and figure out what you need to get to make this worth your while. The marvelous thing is, once you've found this number, life is good. Say it's $Y. If you ask for $Y + 10%, and they say ok, you are happy. They can even work you down a little. But if they can't get above $Y, if their limit is less, you can walk away without the slightest regret or upset. You know it's not worth it for you for that money. And if you get it, you get it. And you're doing something that's worth your while. 

Would you still be annoyed? Are you irritated that this person is not doing certain things, or that this person is treating you like a personal assistant and just handing you tasks? There are two ways things can change in the future - the director can stop assigning you tasks at all, or can assign them more politely, including with more information. It's possible that the latter might address issues with the tasks as well as with the tone, if it hadn't occurred to you that there were non-selfish non-lazy reasons for this behaviour. So, how to get these tasks assigned more politely? Do nothing in front of clients or people who report to either of you. But when alone, or with your mutual boss, consider replying (verbally) to one of these with: (least aggressive) 

Some companies are so large that they hire for many positions at once. They run all day interviews to answer multiple questions at once. The first two or three hours are for "should this person work here?" The next few hours are for "let's persuade this person they really want to work here" - this often includes lunch, a walk through the grounds, a tour of the facilities etc - and the final few hours are for specific managers to figure out if their team is a good fit for the candidate. If things are going well, the afternoon managers will later argue over who gets the candidate. One strange side effect of this is that the company can then gain a reputation for being "hard to be hired at" because of the length of the interview process. Then not only do new grads (who need to be sorted because they at first appear roughly interchangeable) get put through this process, but everybody does. This is usually justified as "once you join us, you join the whole company so the whole company needs a say" but I think it's more "those of us who joined right after graduation had to pass this hurdle, so you do too." Still, it's a good sign if your interview is still going on later in the day - it means they're pretty sure they want you and they're just establishing what team you will start in. 

I think it comes down to one thing: Do you want to be an assistant manager? If you quit because it turns out being an assistant manager is not for you, I wouldn't include it. But if you want to be an assistant manager, by all means show them someone else already decided you were qualified for that. 

A thanks like this has different meanings from a boss than from others, and more importantly when it is uttered. Compare: 

Your boss may then say "ok, I can see that" or more likely "you can't let it interfere with your work together" and you can take the advice. Let me suggest that before your boss notices, you take whatever steps you need to that would ensure your personal feelings don't interfere with your work. These might be any of: 

When I worked for a large company if we wanted to use our personal vehicles for company work, we had to have a minimum liability coverage and we were reimbursed so much a mile. If we didn't have that coverage then we could take cabs or whatever and be reimbursed what we spent. If it's a condition of employment that you provide the car, you can infer that having a valid drivers license and enough insurance are also conditions of employment. The cents-per-mile they are giving you should cover gas, maintenance, wear and tear and insurance for the vehicle. (My experience is that most mileage allowances more than cover all these costs.) If it doesn't, or if you are not given cents-per-mile, address that, but don't try not having enough insurance. That is a very scary path to be going down. 

So, what can you do specifically? First, you could get some sort of issue tracking system in place. TFS is free and I happen to know it, there are others I am sure, heck you could use a Sharepoint list or a spreadsheet. Whenever you become aware of a request, log it. (At this point, don't try to get anyone else in the company to use it. Just use it yourself to handle the requests people drop randomly on you.) See if you can get an idea of urgency. When it's solved, log that too, and if you can, log what the fix was. Over time, you can use your tracker to look for patterns and be in a position to make suggestions. Second, when you get a request and it's not urgent, you could try to see if you could figure out how to do it instead of passing it along. If it is urgent, instead of "Joe has forgotten his password and needs it reset" you could try "can you show me how to reset passwords so I can help Joe?" (Not when he's on vacation. Minimizing disruption to the vacationing person wins in that case.) If you start with "Joe needs a new password" he can just grunt and do it. If you start with "how do you change passwords?" you might get told how. Also, do this IN PERSON so if he just does it, you have half a chance of seeing what he did. If you email him, and hope he will email instructions to you, keep right on hoping. If you get pushback when you ask him to show you how to do it, here's where having a tracking system helps. You can say "this is the 5th request this month for that same thing; if I could do it, you could just leave those things with me and not get interrupted." In an ideal world he sighs, says "you might have a point, kid" and shows you how to do it. Third, in your free time you can write up some sort of process manual - how to do all the things you don't know how to do. This is basically an organized copy of the "results" section of your tracking system. At first it has no instructions in it, but as you learn some or all of how to handle something, you can add to it. You can monitor what requests come in and try to see what is different afterwards, or even ask him "when you have a minute, can you show me what you did to fix Steve's problem? I wouldn't have even known where to start on that one." The existence of this manual will be valuable to the company and make sure that you don't end up later being the guy who doesn't have time to explain all this to the new guy. Fourth, if you're able to talk to the person who hired you, try to find out whether it was your boss' idea to have you here. He might like feeling indispensable and not like you knowing his trade secrets of how to keep the company alive. In that case, you might be between a rock and a hard place. You are getting a little bit of feedback from your boss, even though it's hard to parse. Keep in mind that a question (how do I, what should I, where is) is not the same as telling (I'm going to try, Joe asked me to) and he might be fine with your announcing you are starting - that way he can stop you if it's something very hard or delicate. And if his positions are contradictory you are allowed to say "but yesterday you said XYZ" and let him either realize he's being unreasonable or (and this is crucial) clarify his positions for you so you see they are in fact consistent. It could happen. 

I would not have cc'ed my friend on the "no, I don't want that job" email. It detracts from the main focus. I typically do introductions two ways: 

I started a business, and I hired people to help me. When they were better than I was at a skill, I took their suggestions. But when I was better, we did things my way more often that not. If your boss has started a business doing something in which you have less experience, get used to letting that "double whammy" of "I have more experience" and "it's my company and I sign the cheques" settle most disagreements. 

To: A, B. Body: A, meet B, who is a [great person with such and such skills and experience.] B, meet A, who [is looking for a whatever.] I wanted you two to meet because [as many sentences as you like.] To: A. Body: I think you should know about B. Links to website, public resume, twitter handle, blog, careers.SE profile, etc etc. B would be a great fit for the opportunity we discussed today. [Sentence or two about things you know personally about B.]
