Avoiding hard math, which I'm not very good at, the simple answer is yes, provided there's enough distance. Pluto/Charon have 4 moons orbiting them a bit further away, all in relatively stable orbits. Source Here's distances to scale. - same source. Because the ratio of gravitational field strength to size is exponential (Power of 1.5), the apparent closeness of Pluto and Charon to the 4 small moons looks unusual, but it's perfectly acceptable for objects of that size. Lagrange point stability requires a mass ratio of about 26 to 1. (.0385 to 1 per source). The Earth has satellites in unstable Lagrange points, so it's certainly doable, it's just not technically "stable". The hardest part about getting a satellite to orbit Pluto is that Pluto's sufficiently small that any ship that approaches it would need to slow down significantly on it's own to get captured into a Pluto Orbit. That's why New Horizon was a flyby, not an orbit. 

A lot of these ideas are confusing. They're confusing to scientists too, especially when they were first discovered - so you're not alone. Dark matter was observed because galaxies were behaving strangely. The stars in the outer arms of the galaxy were observed to be moving much too fast and faster than the stars more towards the middle of the galaxy and that made no sense. The galaxies also weighed too much and the only way to explain this was extra mass in kind of a halo around the galaxy, but this extra mass, also, didn't interact with electromagnetic waves like the mass here on earth does - so they called this extra mass (and there's a lot of it, more than there is regular mass), but since it's invisible, they called it "dark matter" and it's not dark like dirt or coal, it's dark as in - invisible. It's completely transparent to light, but it has mass and they still don't know what it is. They have some OK theories, but nothing definite. Now, dark energy - think about the big bang and all matter flying apart - the galaxies twice as far are moving away twice as fast, BUT, as you said, because of gravity, we should see the galaxies that are twice as far moving away more than twice as fast, cause the nearer the galaxy, the more time it's had to slow down - aha, they thought, if we can compare the speed of the galaxies 4 billion light years away to the speed of the galaxies 2 billion light years away to the speed 1 billion light years - etc, etc and measure it all carefully, we can measure the rate at which gravity is slowing down the universe. - that makes sense right. And with careful measurement of Type 1A supernovas, which temporarily outshine entire galaxies - with remarkable consistency (what they call a standard candle - a very bright standard candle, but a standard candle all the same) - with that, they thought they could measure the gravitational slow down of expansion - exactly what you're talking about. The problem was, the measurements told them the opposite of what they expected to find. The measurements told them that the galaxies 2 billion light years away were traveling slightly more than half as fast as the galaxies 4 billion light years away, and so on. They checked this, cause it had to be wrong, then they re-checked it, and re-checked again and the only conclusion was, stuff out there is speeding up, not slowing down - cause that's what the telescopes tell us. Dark energy wasn't a hair-brained scheme that mad scientists thunk up. It was an observed reality that nobody expected (well, cept just maybe for Einstein and his cosmological constant, but that's another story). Dark energy's just a name anyway. They have to call it something, even if they're not sure what it is or how it works. 

This is probably best understood by picture. Comet Swift-Tuttle is both on a highly elliptical orbit, and a highly inclined orbit, though the inclination of the orbit doesn't matter to your specific question, but it helps with the overall picture. What really matters for Earth getting a meteor shower is that the two orbital paths intersect. 

Black holes are surprisingly good at shooting material back into space, strange as that may sound. Source. 

Diameter of Hershal, 139 km. Radius of Mimas, 198 km. Ratio, 70%. But there's an even bigger one. The South Poleâ€“Aitken basin on the moon. 

Expansion is best understood if objects aren't orbiting around each other. If the Moon was stationary and the Earth was stationary, and the only way to do that in our thought experiment is to give one of them a mass of zero so there's no orbit and no gravitational attraction. We're breaking almost every rule in the book with this thought experiment, but bear with me. If we take the measured expansion of space to be 74.3 km/s over 3 million light years. Source. Average lunar distance 384,400 km. And, 9.461 trillion km in 1 light year, so about 2.8 x 10^19 km in 3 million lightyears. Roughly 74 trillion lunar distances. which works out kind of neatly, 74.3 km/s divided by 74 trillion gives us one trillionth of a KM/s, 31.5 million seconds in a year gives us about .0000315 km/year expansion between a stationary, no gravitational attraction moon and Earth, which equals about 3.15 cm per year of expansion of space over 1 lunar distance, which is curiously not far off from 3.8 cm per year increase in distance due to tidal forces, but the similarity is purely coincidental as well as irrelevant. (too long?) 

The pressure at the bottom of the ocean is enormous, it would kill a person in a fraction of a second, but it's tiny compared to the pressure in the center of the earth, and that's tiny compared to the pressure in the center of Jupiter, and that's tiny compared to the pressure inside the sun, and the pressure inside of the sun is also, tiny-tiny-tiny compared to the pressure required to create a black hole. 

I think I understand the spirit of this question and I'll touch some of the basics. Space is, obviously, mostly, but not entirely empty. There's space dust and gas particles bouncing around in what we would call a near perfect vacuum on Earth, but there are still some particles out there, mostly hydrogen and helium, but a disburse scattering of other particles too. In "empty" space, those collisions would be pretty close to negligible over the short term. Bombarding an organic material with hydrogen (very very slowly) and the occasional helium or alpha particle would affect it gradually. I have no idea the time scale though. It might still look very much the same after 1,000 years. Stuff would break down in space very very slowly. Much slower than on Earth where we have wind, water and bacteria. Even if it was struck by a coronal mass ejection from the sun, the particles are disburse enough that it wouldn't make much visible difference, though charged hyrogen, alpha particles and electrons would make some chemical changes. It might grow somewhat carcinagenic, after being struck by a CME but the effects wouldn't be visible. The major effect would be from photons. An object in Earth's orbit, facing the sun would get quite hot, like the surface of the Moon. This heating is almost entirely from the Sun's light. It's temperature would depend on it's color and how much light was absorbed vs reflected. (look up albedo and black body temperature for more info) but a chicken in orbit around the Earth would cook, somewhat slowly, it might take a few hours or maybe the better part of a day, cause one side would be hot the other side cold. The rate of rotation would matter too. Ideally it would rotate very very slowly, so that the side facing the sun would have time to warm up. One rotation every 2-3 hours might work. If it rotates too fast it might never get enough heat to cook on the inside. It's also not a good method of cooking cause the UV rays would make some chemical changes and probably make it carcinogenic. In space, there's no conduction or convection (the primary methods of heat exchange on Earth). Any heating/cooking would come from light from a nearby star and enough light will cook a chicken. In deep space, far from any stars, it would freeze. You know how water feels colder then air when they are the same temperature - that's because of convection. Touching the water pulls heat out of you more effectively than air. Similarly, a chicken will cook faster in 212 degree water than 212 degree air. In space, there's no convection into empty space (if you ignore the unpleasant vacuum effect), it wouldn't feel as cold as very cold air, but your body would still lose heat by radiation and so it would freeze. As I pointed out above, any decay by cosmic rays, once frozen would be very very slow. Perhaps millions of years. That's the gist of it. I think that addresses the spirit of your question. These processes are well understood, so there would be little reason to study this in practice by releasing organic material into space. A related concern is that astronauts in space were hit by cosmic rays and long term exposure wouldn't be healthy for a living person. The space shuttle is largely shielded because it's inside Earth's magnetic field, but outside of that, radiation shielding becomes a problem that needs to be addressed.
