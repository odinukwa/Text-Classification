Yes. There's no harm in replying twice. And if you chose not to reply to the text, there's a very slight possibility that someone on the other end might be confused. Unless the message indicates otherwise, reply using the medium in which the request was sent. In this case, reply via text. 

The key phrase here is "if they want to". You need to convince the interviewer that you do really want to, and explain why that is. You probably need to convince the interviewer that you intend to stay in the position for the long-haul, and aren't just going to jump to a better job (for which you aren't overqualified) once one comes along. That is a common worry employers would have. You need to convince the interviewer that you aren't just planning to sit back, take it easy, and not work hard in this job which won't be a stretch for you. That's also another common worry in this situation. You probably need to convince the interviewer that you won't get bored and leave for a more interesting position. This could easily be a worry. 

Tread carefully here. Make sure that worrying about performance is something relevant to the role you would be performing. If your role in this company would be as a Performance Engineer and you would specifically be tasked with speeding up the system, you might try to see if the interviewer is open to discussing your observations. "While preparing for this interview, I took a look at your system. Would you like to talk about what I see?" Then watch the reaction carefully, and try to gauge how receptive the interview might be. For example, you might be talking to someone who has no knowledge of these libraries, and you would be wasting your time. Or this interviewer might be very interested in your findings. Let her/his reactions be your guide as to how deep you want to go. 

I've heard of companies rescinding offers completely when financing goes south unexpectedly, or there are surprise layoffs. But I've never heard of a paycut imposed before starting - without any explanation being offered. I suppose if the company instituted 10% across-the-board paycuts in the time between the offer and the start date, I could see this legitimately happening. But in that case the hiring manager (or HR) would have immediately provided this as the reason while communicating the paycut. It wouldn't be a "secret", right? I struggle to come up with a "genuine reason" other than greed or "just because we can get away with it", where they wouldn't be forthcoming with a reason as soon as they notified you of the reduced offer. You originally wrote: 

Viable? I don't believe lies are usually viable alternatives, but that is something your personal ethics will dictate. I can say that I never hire people who lie to me (assuming I find out before an offer is made). And finding out that an employee lied during an interview is grounds for firing in every company where I have ever worked. 

It certainly happens that people reneg on their word, and sometimes on signed employment contracts. However I don't think this is "usual". It's unusual in my part of the world, in my network at least. As far as "wrong" - clearly you thought it was wrong. I agree with your instincts. 

No. "Over-qualified" means that the experienced, perhaps well-paid, applicant is not a good fit for the specific position which happens to require less experience and offering less pay. As a hiring manager, I want both the position and the applicant to be a great fit for each other. In general, I want to hire someone who can grow in the position, who can be happy and enjoy themselves while contributing to the team, and who will likely be here for the long-haul. Usually that means someone who matches the position technically, and experience-wise, or can grow into that match quickly. I have hired folks who had more experience than the position required (and were "over-qualified" in at least some aspects). In each case, they were looking to make a change in their career path for a good reason. While interviewing, I made sure they weren't just looking to "take it easy" or weren't just "willing to accept less" for a short period of time. It's certainly possible to get hired when over-qualified. It's just important to convince the hiring manager that you won't become bored, won't suddenly start to feel underpaid, and will eagerly accept your new (lesser) position. 

Bring it up with your manager during your next 1-on-1 meeting. Instead of asking for a 1-month vacation now, just ask about the company policy for such vacations instead. As Monica Cellio points out, you could ask in an open-ended way -- not "I'd like to take next month off" but more like "sometime in the next {several months, year, whatever - but not immediate} I'd like to take a few weeks to visit my family in India; how do we handle longer leaves?" This is something anyone wishing to travel home for long periods of time will need to know. Any US company that regularly hires folks from India, China, etc. has already faced this sort of issue, and will likely already have a protocol in place. That is certainly the case for my company. We regularly arrange such lengthy vacations, although requesting one when you have been at the company for only two months wouldn't usually be acceptable in my company. Many companies would expect you to wait until you have actually accrued 4 weeks or so worth of vacation time. If that is the case at your company, HR would be able to tell you how your vacation accruals work, and at what point you will have accrued 4 weeks vacation. Some companies will permit you to "borrow" unaccrued vacation time. Again, HR could tell you. A few companies will not permit you to take more than a few weeks vacation at a time. As David K points out, you could also ask about the possibility of working remotely, if the job and the trip allow it. Answering emails and getting some work done could certainly ease having someone away for a month. It may depend on your role within the company, what is going on at the moment regarding projects, who can replace you for a month, etc. But in almost all circumstances, it will be necessary to work with your manager when requesting your vacation. Your manager will need to coordinate your schedule against your projects, and whoever will fill in for your work in your absence. In my company, most folks wishing to travel back to India save up their vacation time, and travel once every two years at most. On some occasions (emergencies) we allow folks to "borrow" vacation time. In some cases, folks bring a computer with them to work remotely. Your mileage may vary. 

No. You are entitled to be paid for all of your hours worked. Even if the project runs over the allotted time, even if your work is the reason why it went over, even if you feel bad - you should still be paid for your work. Keep the stakeholders informed as the project progresses, and warn them if you see problems coming up that might cause you to go over the estimation. And as you run out of allotted time ask them if they would like you to continue to fix bugs, or just to stop - it's their project, and their money, so they get to decide. If this becomes a chronic problem, and you cannot estimate better, or produce work with fewer bugs, your job might be in jeopardy. Still, if you work, you should be paid. 

Assuming you didn't request the transfer yourself, it's perfectly reasonable to ask for an increase due to the change in cost of living in the new location. 

Yes. Honesty is virtually always the best policy. And honesty spares you the embarrassment of having to explain why you were dishonest, should you be found out. You aren't required to include all of your jobs on your resume, but omitting it means that you either have a gap in your resume, or you are intentionally misleading a potential employer about the job before your current job. Both of these would be awkward to explain should you be questioned. You have explained your desire to leave in your question. Saying "it's become clear in the two months I've been here this isn't going to work out; he seems to expect things that I can't do this early on and seems very upset with me" is powerful, and certainly something that can be understood by recruiters and hiring managers. This is particularly true given that your background doesn't show a long list of short-term jobs. Be honest about it. Interviewers will appreciate your honesty and your ability to intelligently reflect on a gig that didn't go as planned (something that eventually happens to all of us). Your integrity and reputation will be intact. And you'll sleep better at night. 

As always - it depends. If I were doing your reference check, and I learned that the title you reported wasn't the title you held, I might categorize that as a "lie". I don't hire people who lie, so that would lose you the role. In other scenarios (perhaps other hiring managers or other companies), they might not consider this important, and that wouldn't cause you to lost the role. 

It's rather cheesy, but I've seen it and similar situations before. I've worked for one. At least in my part of the world, it's considered an acceptable practice. Have you approached management and asked if you could bring your own home-laundered fleece? Have you asked management if they would purchase a fleece for you and you would launder it yourself? 

Certainly. Everyone needs to understand changes to company practices, so it's reasonable to ask if you are seeing one. 

If you aren't typically co-located, then it makes sense to ask via a quick phone call or email for and set up a face-to-face meeting. 

Unless bankruptcy is imminent, there is simply no excuse for not paying the electrical bill. Someone doesn't know what they are doing. 

In your review, your boss if giving you the clear hint... Slow down! Spend more time on ensuring quality, even if it means you cannot agree to do everything for everyone. Fast is good. But correct is (almost always) more important. A presentation containing grammatical and syntactical errors can not only be embarrassing to you, but could cost your company (if it is presented externally). That simply shouldn't be happening repeatedly no matter what your workload might be. If you aren't capable of managing your own workload, you need to talk to your boss and together come up with a strategy to deal with it. That might mean a To Do List, where new requests are added to the bottom and you get to them in time. Or it might mean filtering requests through your boss. Or you might come up with a better solution. Don't wait yet another two years to address this problem. Fix it now. Reap the rewards in your next review. 

Then realize that "double standards" like this happen in every company. Everyone in a company is not equal. Maybe you'd be better off just letting this one go, and save your concern for more important matters. I work in a company with similar security rules. The rules may make sense for headquarters, but in my small office, they really don't. Lots of folks "tailgate" or knock to be buzzed in. It's just not that big of a deal. I simply won't damage my work relationship with others by being the "badge police". Nor will I accost someone who is walking around without visibly displaying their badge. 

It's terrible advice. When you graduate in December, you will have an advantage that few new graduates have. You will also have relevant experience. In addition, you will be looking during a time of year when there are fewer new graduates competing for the same positions. So it makes perfect sense to be looking for a job right now. But why would you quit your job? That part makes no sense. While your current job might not be the high-salaried position you desire, it does pay your bills. Thus, you won't feel as pressured to jump at the first offer as you would if you had no income. I always advise people to never leave their current job until they have accepted their next job. Start looking for a job right away. Don't wait until your graduation. But don't quit your current job until you find the job you really want. And tell your friend "Thanks anyway."
