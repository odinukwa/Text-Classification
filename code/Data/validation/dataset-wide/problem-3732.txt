Is there a structure theorem for such varieties? If X is a smooth and proper/projective variety whose canonical bundle $\omega_X$ has finite order in the Picard group, do we know anything about X? EDIT: As was pointed out in the comments, if $\omega_X^n = O_X$ then one can find a cycling covering of order n, $Y \to X$, with $\omega_Y = O_Y$. So the problem reduces to understanding varieties with trivial canonical bundle. I'll leave the question as is for a few days more, in case someone else wants to contribute. If nothing happens I will delete it. 

Given a(n $\infty$-)category, there is a process called "stabilitazion" which spits out a stable $\infty$-category (as one can read about in either Higher Algebra or the nlab). The famous example is Spectra, which is the stabilization of Top (and I guess the various enhancements of derived categories, out of categories of modules). If I start instead with the plain old category of pointed sets, what is its stabilization? And if I start with finite pointed sets? 

Context: this is a step to the proof of Claim 3.7 in this paper (if you have access to Comm Math Phys, the published version is here). In that paper, they used the "identity" $ \tan (\theta)\tan(\varphi)=\frac{1}{\Vert B \Vert^2},$ which I am pretty sure is false (you can choose $z$ to be in the most expanding direction, in which case we have $\varphi=0$ and so the LHS is $0$). 

I need to solve the following system of quasi-linear partial differential equations, where the unknowns $f(x,t), g(x,t)$ are smooth functions on $\mathbb R^2$, $$ \dfrac{\partial}{\partial t}f=\dfrac{\partial}{\partial x}((f^2+g)f),$$ $$ \dfrac{\partial}{\partial t} g=\dfrac{\partial}{\partial x}((f^2+g)g),$$ I think I am supposed to use the method of characteristics to find a characteristic surface, but I don't know how to do this. (I asked a more or less equivalent question on Math Stackexchange here, and got no answers) 

Motivation A topological vector space is a vector space over a (topological) field, K, that carries a topology such that addition and scalar multiplication are continuous maps, e.g., all normed vector spaces. Since $\mathbb{C} \approx \mathbb{R}^2$ as topological spaces (with their standard topologies), it's clear that the actual field cannot be detected by the topology alone. Also, cardinality considerations show that any topology on a finite field cannot be homeomorphic to a vector space over a field of characteristic $0$. But that still says nothing about whether there are some topologies, such that, for instance $\mathbb{Z}_p(t) \approx \mathbb{Q}$. I can't find any topological invariants that will distinguish just the fields (as vectors spaces of dimension 1). I suspect that if this problem is solvable, it will be just be topological group considerations, but I can't figure out how to do it. 

I asked the following question at Math Stackexchange a while ago here but did not get a correct answer. 

I understand that the KdV equation, $$u_t(x,t)=-u_{xxx}(x,t)-6u(x,t)u_x(x,t)$$ is a compatibility condition of the two equations $$\psi_{xx}(x,t)=-(u(x,t)+\lambda)\psi(x,t),$$ $$\psi_t(x,t)=u_x(x,t)\psi(x,t)+(4\lambda-2u(x,t))\psi_x(x,t).$$ In other words, if these two equations are true it implies the KdV equation. These calculations are straightforward and available in these lecture notes. My goal is to understand why the KdV equation is an isospectral evolution of the Schrödinger operator $$H(\psi)=\psi_{xx}+u\psi$$ I can see why the evolution given by the KdV equation preserves the eigenvalues of $H$. But 

I will comment that it is easy to show this is true if $f$ is assumed to be analytic, but it seems rather difficult if I don't have this assumption. Through some basic PDE tricks (method of characteristics, etc) it is possible to show a local version of this result: that for a fixed $x$, there is a small $\epsilon(x)$ such that $f(x,t)=0$ for all $0<t<\epsilon(x)$, but this is not good enough for my purposes. 

I am trying to understand Remark 11.3 in Huybrechts's amazing book on derived categories (FM transforms in AG). He starts with smooth projective varieties $j\colon Y \subset X$ and aims to describe the local ext groups $\underline{Ext}^i(j_*O_Y,j_*O_Y)$ in terms of $\wedge^i N$ where $N$ is the normal bundle of $Y$ in $X$. To describe this, he mentions a morphism $\wedge^k \underline{Ext}^1(j_*O_Y,j_*O_Y) \to \underline{Ext}^k(j_* O_Y, j_* O_Y)$ which he calls cup product (or composition). 

Maybe Asher Auel's thesis? But maybe it's still schemes, not sure! (but that thesis is still awesome) $URL$ 

This is somewhat sad, but I think (part of) what we've learned from the whole triangulated-vs-dg story is the following pseudo-statement: the bare category of functors Fun(D(X),D(Y)) is the wrong thing to take -- it should be replaced the category D(X x Y). There is a nice example, due to the usual Bondal-Orlov-Bridgeland people (Example 6.5 in Caldararu's notes), which illustrates this perfectly. Thus, if you find something weird happening in Fun(D(X),D(Y)) you shouldn't be discouraged -- it's not your fault. Of course, there are big names in the field (Canonaco and Stellari to name two) who might disagree with my initial pseudo-statement. It really depends on what you care about. 

I am concerned about the Schrödinger equation $-x''(t)+q(t)x(t)=Ex(t).$ Here, the potential $q$ is real and quasiperiodic with frequency vector $\omega$. That is, we let $T^d$ be the $d$-dimensional torus and $\omega=(\omega_1,\ldots, \omega_d)\in T^d$ with the $\{\omega_j\}$ rationally independent, and $q(t)=f(\omega_1t,\omega_2t,\ldots,\omega_d t)$ for some continuous $f:T^d\to\mathbb R$, Equivalently, we may formulate this equation as a matrix equation instead, $X'(t)=\begin{pmatrix} 0&1\\ q(t)-E& 0 \end{pmatrix}X(t)$, where $X(t)=\begin{pmatrix} x_1(t)& x_2(t)\\ x_1'(t)& x_2'(t) \end{pmatrix}.$ There are two equivalent descriptions of a Floquet-Bloch solution, which I am having difficulty reconciling. First, we say a solution of the form $x(t)=e^{kt}(p_1(t)+tp_2(t))$ is a Floquet-Bloch solution, where $k$ is a constant and $p_1, p_2$ are quasiperiodic functions with frequency vector $\omega$ or $\omega/2$. Second, we say $X(t)=Y(\omega t/2)e^{At}$ is a Floquet-Bloch solution, where $A\in SL(2,R)$ and $Y:T^d\to GL(2,R)$. I don't see why these two are the same thing? 

I hope this is well known, I just could not work it out myself. Say I have a variety X (smooth and projective over C is my usual setup) with a smooth subvariety Z. Let f: BL_Z(X) --> X be the blowup of X with centre Z and let E be the exceptional. 

I cannot seem to find stated the following fact, which is surely well known to experts. Let (S,L) be a polarized K3 surface. Then $M = L^{\otimes 3}$ is very ample and we can consider the embedding in the corresponding projective space $S \to P^N$. Question: is the image of $S$ in $P^N$ a complete intersection? I suspect the answer is no but I haven't seen it stated explicitly. (by the way, I am certainly allowing $S = H_1 \cap ... \cap H_k \cap D_1 \cap D_2$, where the $H_i$ are hyperplanes and $D_1, D_2$ or more interesting divisors. (information about other embeddings of S which are complete intersections, or statements about when one can know if S is a complete interesction would be highly appreciated as well) 

I am trying to understand this short paper and I am getting stuck right at the end. Let $V(x)$ be $C^\infty$ and 1-periodic (that is, $V(x)=V(x+1)$). We are considering the operator $$A=-\dfrac{d^2}{dx^2}+V$$ on $L^2([0,1],dx)$ where $A$ has periodic boundary condition $f'(1)=f'(0)$, $f(1)=f(0)$. Suppose that for some $n$ even, the $n+1$st eigenvalue of $A$ coincides with the $n$th eigenvalue of $A$. We call that eigenvalue $\hat E$. In other words, there is a multiplicity 2 eigenvalue of $A$ at $\hat E$. It is known that all solutions $u\in L^2 (\mathbb R, dx)$ to the Schrödinger equation $$-u''(x)+V(x)u(x)=\hat E u(x)$$ are periodic. Let $u_1(x)$ be the solution with initial conditions $u(0)=0, u'(0)=1$ and let $u_2(x)$ be the solution with initial conditions $u(0)=1, u'(0)=0$. It is easy to find a 1-periodic function $W(x)$ in $C^\infty$ that satisfies $$\int_0^1 W(x) u_1(x)^2 dx\neq \int_0^1 W(x) u_2(x)^2 dx.$$ Let $\lambda$ be a small constant. Supposedly, when we perturb $V$ by $\lambda W$ in the definition of $A$ (that is, replace $V$ with $V+\lambda W$) we can guarantee that for sufficiently small $\lambda$ the $n+1$st eigenvalue of $A$ no longer coincides with the $n$th eigenvalue. Why is that true? The paper cites Kato's Perturbation Theory for Linear Operators as justification, but I cannot find anything there that is directly relevant. 

Obviously, an answer to b) implies an answer for a). I'm not sure how much of my thinking I should put here. But I do know that if char K = p, then we get a homeomorphism of $V$ onto itself by translation for each $v \in V$, which each have finite order p. These are mapped to self-homeomorphisms of $W$ which also have order p, but a priori, they don't "see" any of the algebraic structure of $W$, so I'm not sure this is actually an obstruction. Any thoughts (or references) to proofs or counterexamples would be greatly appreciated. 

Let $\Bbb{R}^{+}\_{0}$ be the set of non-negative real numbers and $\Bbb{R}^{+}$be the set of positive reals. Let us say that a function $f \colon \Bbb{R}^{+}\_{0} \to \Bbb{R}^{+}\_{0}$ is eventually sublinear if $\ \forall r \in \Bbb{R}^{+} \ \exists x_0 \in \Bbb{R}^{+} \colon \forall x \geq x_0, f(x) < rx$. Let $S$ be the set of non-decreasing, eventually sublinear functions (we require no continuity). We define an equivalence relation on $S$: $f \sim g$ if and only if $f$ and $g$ are eventually boundedly close, i.e., $\exists K>0\ \exists x_0 \in \Bbb{R}^{+} \colon \forall x \geq x_0, |f(x)-g(x)| < K$. Denote the set of equivalence classes of $S$ under $\sim$ by $\ T$. Question 1: What is the cardinality of $\ T$? Question 2: Does this cardinality change if we drop the requirement that the functions are non-decreasing? What if the co-domain becomes $\Bbb{R}$? Looking at the set of pairwise non-equivalent sublinear functions $\{f(x) = r*ln(x) \mid r \in \Bbb{R}\}$ shows that $|T|$ must be at least as big as the cardinality of the reals, $\beth_1$. Also, $|T|$ can be no bigger than the cardinality of all functions from $\Bbb{R}$ to $\Bbb{R}$, which is $\beth_2$, the cardinality of the power set of the reals. So there seem to be three options: Option 1: ZFC proves $|T| = \beth_1$. Option 2: ZFC proves $|T| = \beth_2$. Option 3: This question is independent from ZFC (but perhaps not independent from ZFC + Generalized CH?). Different proof ideas involving explicit bounds or forcing are failing me. So does anyone know of an answer and a proof? Thanks.
