It features in Rocky therefore has all the associations related to that film. Egg yolks have lots of fat in, however egg whites are really just water and protein (about 90% water and 10% protein). They would be slightly cheaper than chicken if you don't mind eating 10 of them. Chicken however has a lot more protein as a percentage - 24% compared to 3%. It'd be cheaper and less labor-intensive to simply eat protein shakes or chicken. 

So the easiest way to immediately stop the stitch is to leave 1.5 - 2 hours after eating before running, and slow down to a speed where you don't get stitch. Usually it was the former though, and reducing how much I ate also helped (switching to a single pita, baked potato or cereal bar). If you want to relieve it while running, bending over forward with your hands towards the floor helps to relieve it, although you do look a bit stupid running down the road doing this. A simple breathing technique can help - breath in and hold your breath for 5 seconds, then as you exhale breath in as you're exhaling. It definitely gets easier if the two reasons I gave are the cause of the stitch. If the eating timing doesn't make any difference then a trip to the doctor or physio would be best. 

This is going to sound counterintuitive, but hear it out. If you want to get better at performing in the heat, train in the cold. First and foremost training in the cold is a more rigorous workout. Every aspect of improved performance depends on your body becoming more proficient and efficient. The more effective your body becomes at exertion, the less resources it needs to do the same effort. The way the body responds to heat and cold are not terribly different in terms of thermal dynamics. You want your body to be able to move heat, and the more heat it can move the better you are at withstanding heat or cold. Adding heat load increases risk, and does not work the same as adding weights to a bar. The thermal environment of a sauna versus a desert are too dissimilar to be effective. Indeed I'd surmise the result to be negative. Running in desert heat involves a lovely ballet of air currents you do not find in a sauna. The type of heat is dramatically different - no sun in the sauna. To improve your body's ability to handle heat, raise it through more strenuous effort. Sprints instead of hours long runs, for example. If possible, do these in colder temperatures, not warmer ones. In the long run, pun unintended, improving your body's native thermal transfer and heat dynamics such as breathing as well as decreasing the time and effort it takes to cross the same distance will serve you better, and without the added risk of heat stroke and decreased rebound and recovery capacity. If you still feel you must train in a hotter climate, wear layered clothing. Indeed in my experience wearing more clothing rather than less in the desert reduced water loss. While I don't fully understand it, the body does seem to sweat more when more skin is exposed. I suspect it is a dynamic local calculation in order to redirect heat to where it can be whisked away. You might be surprised to learn a lot of desert racers wear full length clothing during the race. Some use "space blankets" even. Drinking a smaller amount of water will not improve your ability to operate on lower amounts of water. The body needs the same amount of water for the same expenditure of effort. Water is also essential to recover, and going into a deficit will increase your recovery time, thus decreasing your overall training time and increasing the risk of overtraining. Indeed you want to drink often while training to develop the habit. Drink like you should in the desert, not less. How much you drink in the desert will be determined initially by your habit of drinking water. If you habitually drink less, you will automatically drink too little in the event and suffer for it. Learn to drink when it is less critical, not when your life is on the line. It is a matter of biochemistry, not practice. What you seek is to expend less effort, only in that way can you stand a chance at lower water requirements. Even then, the difference will be negligible. When it comes to sweating how much you sweat is up to your body. Some people are profuse sweaters and others are not. Generally the more effort is required, the higher the sweat level becomes. The phrase "without breaking a sweat" exists for a reason. You also need to learn what nutrients and electrolytes your body needs and when. How much do you plan to carry? How much will you decide you really need after the first hour? ;) These are questions you need to answer before the event. So why train in the cold? In addition to the increased effort, it stresses the body to transfer heat. In a hot climate the body is trying to push heat out into a hot environment. It has no options. In cold it is trying to move heat around the body to get where it needs to be. This thermal dynamic improves your ability to shed heat. When I was in the desert, those who came from hot climates always did worse than those from cold ones when it came to handling exertion in the heat. Sure, they didn't view the heat the same way, but they didn't handle it as well either. Maybe they didn't respect it, or maybe they were physiologically unprepared for it, I don't know. Just that they didn't handle it as well. All that said, your other preparation will be more important, and is often overlooked. Consider what you need to do to protect your body on the dunes. Heavy sunscreen. This includes clothing as well as pastes. Sand. Lots and lots of sand. Ever run with sand in your shoes? Know how to handle that? These will be greater impacts than you realize. Many think the heat is their greatest opponent in the desert. They are wrong. You need to learn to move and run while minimizing the entire environment. Direct sunlight is your opponent, sandy shoes are your opponent. I know it sounds crazy, but take it from someone who spent crazy amounts of time in deserts while ending to do high intensity activities. You won't be defeated because you didn't train in the heat. You'll be defeated because you didn't plan for the rest of the environment. Run in leggings, paste, full body protection, gaiters, sunglasses, gear on, etc. Do these things not because they might make you better, but to create the habit of wearing these items as extensions of your body. Cheers, and good luck. 

The Alexander Technique may be something to look into, it's used (at least by the NHS in the UK) for rehabilitation of spinal injury victims. However, it does concentrate on posture rather than muscle building exercises. 

$URL$ is the best of the others I've tried. It allows user data and has a decent user interface unlike the competition. It'd be nice if they could all get together and offer a single database instead of the 5-6 bad ones you get now. Another place to try is mysupermarket, for example an Apple 

The advice they give you at runner shops: 6 months (I wonder why?!). Obviously it depends on how many miles you run per week, but you will notice the difference if you change them at least once a year if you do a lot of treadmill running, which is like rubbing them down on sandpaper. 

You can't target the fat in your belly as everyone has pointed out, however you can do certain exercises that are best for fat burning. High impact aerobic exercise is better for fat burning than low impact - an example of low impact is swimming. A great high impact activity for fat burning is interval training. There's a 1001 variations on it, just Google "sprint training". Alternatively a sport like 5-aside football, tennis, basketball. You'll need to do those 2-3 times a week though to get any noticeable benefit. Here's a training routine from Men's Health a few years ago (which also re-iterated the paragraph above) 

I wouldn't worry about reducing my water intake during a run in hot weather. Just because your fellow runners don't drink anything doesn't mean it is a good idea for you (or them). Particularly under the conditions you are describing I would recommend you keep drinking water. It will help you perform better. As to the weight loss during the run: are you using a medical scale? If not, do no trust the numbers. If you want to track that, weigh several times. To give you an example of what a non-medical scale can do against you, I tracked my weight every morning when awaking for nearly a year. I found that often stepping off then on would vary by half to a full kilo, sometimes more. If I moved the scale a few inches I could get the same effect. I could weigh, go back to bed for twenty minutes, then weigh again and suddenly "gain" weight - to the tune of 2% or more of my bodyweight. Ultimately, the first barometer to use is how you feel. If you cut back on the water does your performance suffer? How does your recovery change, if at all? In every group I've been in (in and out of the military) where significant physical activity took place in hot conditions (dry or humid), those who hydrated performed and recovered better. I would go with recording your metrics, adding subjective such as how you felt during and after the run for a baseline of two weeks. Then increase by 50% and repeat for two weeks. Then go 50% below baseline for another two weeks. Then compare how each phase worked for or against you. From there make changes and track the results until you arrive at what seems to be optimal for you. 

I experienced quite bad stitch when I first started running, and after some casual research discovered my problem was coming from: 

It has various studies to back it up but from experience is a bit of a pain to clean - you have to buy baby milk bottle sterializer to clean them with. 

If you look at the nutrition value of the bar it looks like their claims are largely BS. The product has high amounts of sugar and seems to fit into the mid-to-high GI/GL bracket so won't be providing a slow intake of energy (low GI foods are associated with this). And the feeling full factor is likely to come from the 500ml of water you're drinking with it rather than the bar. 

The main problem with eating breakfast before a work out is you have to wait an hour or more for it to be digested. For jogging, a lot of people prefer to eat a carbohydrate rich meal before bed to avoid the wait in the morning. If you aren't doing anything intense, a low speed 30 minute jog for example, this probably isn't necessary. But for more intense work outs you will use your glycogen supplies quickly without carb-loading the night before. You'll then get tired and do less, and lose lean tissue. So the choice for running is a low intensity jog on a piece of fruit or drink, or mid-high intensity with a meal the night before. 

Because all other things are certainly not equal. The cow isn't a sphere, it is a cow. Testosterone is critical, absolutely. However, it is more of a limiting factor than a dominant directly causal one. The male and female hormone systems are different in more than just T levels, and these additional hormones such as HGH, IGF, and others play a significant role as well. Part of your question also stems from a societally induced belief that steroids simply make you big. They do not. Going above your body's natural growth limits may require steroids, but it will also require much more in terms of other bio-chemcial regimens and will have to be different for the sexes due to the underlying structural differences. Thus putting a man and a woman on the same regimen will not produce the same results. For that matter, you can put two "near identical" men on the exact same regimen and not get the same end result. Other factors such as microbiome, individual normal shifts, and even mental factors throw a monkey wrench in the basic premise. Finally, the changes necessary for the stronger muscles happen much earlier in life. Adding steroids or testosterone after physical maturity can not retroactively build the body for the higher load of activities such as powerlifting. Hypothetically it may be possible to produce a female with the same makeup by applying drastic hormone and strength training at a very early age but it would be a dubious proposal and certainly not one I'd expect to ever be done. All of this doesn't mean an individual woman can not be stronger than an individual man. It simply means that the strongest male powerlifter will be capable of lifting heavier than the strongest female powerlifter - even (or especially) with the same regimen. 

In my (limited) experience I would recommend using the Smart Coach to set yourself speed goals. The tool speeds you up gently over a 12-16 week period (or less amount of time if you're feeling like a challenge). It gives you an indurance run, a gentle run and speed training each week. I only use it for 10k running so I can't speak for half or full marathon running, but it really improved my pace a lot - down to about 46 mins from 50+ mins. 

Avoiding alcohol is the other obvious way to lose the belly fat. If you drink 2-3 pints of beer three times a week, being alcohol free for a week will lose you 0.25kg. 

Another exercise involves using the elbow to massage the back, with a fair amount of pressure - obviously you'll need a partner/friend/willing house mate to do it though, and it hurts. 

The advice I was given by a professional physiotherapist was to concentrate on stride length, and landing on the back of the foot/heel (I pronate though, so this was probably foot shape specific). It may have been very generic advice and not something an Olympic champion would care about, but it helped my pace/lap time quite a lot. Squats and glute exercises are worth considering too, especially if you are increasing your mileage fairly quickly, both help if you suffer from shin-splints. 

I wash in a low-water front loading washing machine every few days (1-2x per week). I also use a Tea Tree Oil liquid for the soap. I use a pre-wash cycle with the tee tree oil in both times and no other detergents. Once done they come out and go right in front of a fan to dry. I've been doing this for a year with my shoes as well as my two daughters' and we wear them all the time. I mean all day to work, around the house, yard work, and running - that kind of all day. When not near home to do that I'll go sit in a hot tub or swim in a pool for a while. The chlorine content will kill the bacteria off. In fact the first time I encountered the stink that is what we did as we were in a hotel in a different state. Worked beautifully. Wearing socks helps reduce the speed of the buildup, so if you can wear them try that in addition to cleaning them regularly. MY oldest daughter tried that and it did reduce it. She could get away with washing once a week or so. My youngest daughter and I can't stand them so we just wash twice a week. After over a year, lots of miles and washes, nary a day going by without being worn my Vibrams (Bikila LS) are still hanging strong with just some of the reflective tape peeling off. Another thing I've tried is isopropyl alcohol, 70% solution. Soak them for a few minutes in that, then let dry in front of a fan. Works well. The dry in front of a fan I have found to be crucial. Times when the fan wasn't available they would pick the smell back up quickly.
