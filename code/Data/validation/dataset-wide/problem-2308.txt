In practice however you have to deal with the resistance. A good approximatin is that pulleys (as a 180Â° redirect) are about 90% efficient, and carabiners about 50%. This means if you pull with one unit of tension on one side, the other side only experiences about 90% (or 50%). We can use the same method again and we can see that in practice you only expect about a 4.5:1 advantage: 

That means the (muzzle-) speed of the new arrow will be about 7% greater than the one of the old arrow. Using the "correct" formula In this case we get: 

If we swap the top pulley and the carabiner, we actually get a better MA of about 4.92:1 with the same gear (but we obviously lose the progress capturing). 

As you can see my rule of thumb is less than 10% off the "exact" formula if the new arrow is at least half as heavy and at most twice as heavy as the old one. But if you consider arrows with a weight difference of a factor two, then the initial assumption is probably get us a way bigger error. Example In your example we have 

In addition to @Mike's excellent answer I'd like to suggest replacing the barrel knots of the double fisherman's with blake hitches. If properly dressed and set this will prevent the loop from sliding back to full length when under load, whereas the double fishermans slides a lot quicker. 

If it doesn't need to be pretty, a cost effective option is spinnaker repair tape (nylon cloth tape, for example, see products on this page). It is designed for repairs to yacht sails so it is durable, weatherproof and should survive a machine wash (but it wont be breathable). Stick a piece over the hole on the front and back of the fabric. 

Instant ice packs, like this one, which are usually used for treating sprains and strains sound a bit like what you are looking for. They use a chemical reaction to cool, but, they are single use only. Such instant ice packs work by mixing ammonium nitrate with water. The hydration of ammonium nitrate is endothermic (absorbs heat). Perhaps unintuitively, you would need to apply more heat to dehydrate the ammonium nitrate and keep it separate from the moisture you are removing to be able to reuse. I guess this would be difficult to achieve in a simple reusable pack. Personally, I like using my buff dipped a stream or river and worn round my neck to cool down.

In addition to the other answer I'd like to add that ropes are way safer than webbing in a scenarion where it actually comes in contact with rock. This is the case in top rope anchors when you have to tie the rope back over the edge of a cliff. Ropes are designed with a protective layer (mantle) and a load bearing inner part, also when moving, they only touch the rock with s amall part and they can 'roll' over the rock while webbing under tension gets severed easily. Regarding knotting webbing: For nylon webbing this is ok and accepted quite everywhere, but dyneema is too slippery to be safely knoted. PS: These do not answer your question but provide intersting insights into using knots with webbing /slings: $URL$ $URL$ 

Using the rule of thumb: In this case and are not really that close, so this result might be a bit off compared to the other one: With the above values we have: 

I do not know any rule of thumbs but I do have some knowledge in physics and math, so lets see what we can do with that=) Let's assume the energy that is put into an arrow is independent of the weight of the arrow. If we would want to model this too, it would be highly dependent of construction of the bow, and not useful for any rule of thumb. And as long as the weight of the two arrows we want to consider is sufficiently similar, this assumption will still provide good enough results. Let's call the mass of the first arrow and the mass of the second one , similarly denotes the velocity of the first arrow, the velocity of the second one. As the kinetic energy stays constant we have the equation: 

When using lead climbing techniques the lead climber is belayed by his partner and as he climbs he places protection (e.g. camming devices). Once at the top of the pitch, the lead climber then belays his partner on the pitch. The second climber retrieves the protection as he climbs. 

The instructions I've always heard are unequivocal - always wear a life vest. By all means make sure it fits well and lose straps are tucked away to minimise entanglement, but, when in a sport where there is real risk of falling in water and being knocked unconscious definitely wear a life vest. 

Are your shoes laced too tightly? If they are too tight over the instep, movement in your foot as you walk will increase friction at the heal. Are your shoes laced too loosely? They should be tight enough so your feet do not slip up and cause friction as you walk (but not too tight per point 1). Wear two pairs of socks. A light pair of inner socks may alleviate the problem so the friction occurs between the layers of socks rather than on your skin. Avoid cotton socks. Cotton tends to stay damp once it is wet (either due to the weather or persperation) and wet socks will exacerbate any friction. Wear good quality socks designed for hiking. They will be made from material that dries easily and wicks away moisture. They should also be designed to minimise friction. 

The strength is dependent mainly on the angle between the two ropes form, on which the hammock is hung, and the weight you want the hammock to support. For a traditional hammock the angles of the ropes (measured to the horizontal) are about (just an estimate). Lets assume we want to design the system for a person weighing . Then we can derive a formula for the force ( acting on the ropes using trigonometry: 

(Note that the Force gets extremely high, the closer to horizontal the ropes are / the close is at ) With the assumptions from above we get , but this is just static loading, as soon as you "dynamically" sit down in it the forces can be higher. I'd go with a safety factor of about 5 to be on the absolute safe (that means 5 times the static weight it absolutely needs to support, consider that any knots weaken the rope, a knot can reduce the strength by up to ), so that results in about strength. I have no experience using parachord, but this site also suggests to use rope of at least . Another reference I just found is this online hammock anchor calculator. 

Now after I got some answers I'd like to post my own observations: The most 'efficient' method I found so far with out using foot ascenders is using two conventional ascenders/(or prussiks/tibloc etc) with each a footloop. (And both obviously also connected to your harness for safety.) That way you can use your leggs to push yourself up. But it still can be relatively tiring compare to using foot ascenders as you have balance your body such that you keep the feet directly under your body. So I think the crucial thing is keeping the rope close to your body. Comparision to rope access techs/ arborists Arborists who are using foot ascenders do this by having their friction device permanently on the rope. The special thing about their devices is that they can be used for ascending or decending on a tensioned rope, unlike the grigri/tubers/other belaying devices in climbing. Here images of foot ascenders and a typical "rope wrench system": Source Source You can also observe this idea in rope access. Rope access technicians do have full body harnesses that quite often a built in chest ascender, that is that way kept close to the body. 

Safety equipment for each sport is designed, tested and certified specifically for that sport. Different sports have different and often competing priorities for the type of protection and comfort required. An example of competing priorities might be that climbing helmets need to provide extra protection at the top of the head to defend against falling rock, whereas, cycling helmets are designed to provide additional ventilation for comfort. In short, climbing helmets are not suitable for cycling and cycling helmets are not suitable for climbing. Wear the correct safety equipment for the activity you are taking part in. 

As Cryptosporidium is passed in the faeces of animals, the more heavily the land is used by animals, the greater the risk of Cryptosporidium contamination in water sourced from that land. This article suggests some ways (quoted below) to avoid Giardia (which has a similar lifecycle to Cryptosporidium), conversely, if you are unable to source water following these guidlines the greater risk of Cryptosporidium contamination. 

The key advantage of a geodesic design is the pole configuration can support a greater static load. This means they are favoured for mountaineering expeditions because they can withstand a heavy snow fall (compared with a tunnel design that would sag with the weight of the snow between each pole). Tunnel tents are preferred for polar expeditions as they generally have a better weight to space ratio (the walls are more "vertical" than an equivalent geodesic design), they are simpler and quicker to pitch and as many regions of the Poles have little precipitation (some areas being classified as desert) the ability to withstand heavy snowfall is much less of a consideration. 

That would again mean the new arrow is about 7% faster than the old one. By the numbers you could guess that the approximation is about 3% off the "exact" value, as predicted. Bottom line Again looking at the graph above, we can conclude that if the weights are close enough, I suggest the rule of thumb the relative difference in velocity is going to be about half the relative difference in mass. What do I mean by that: If you have a weight difference of 10% (as long as the weights are close enough, it does not matter which one you consider as 100%) then the difference in velocity is going to be about 5%. Again checking with the "exact" formula (considering ) 

where denotes the square root. If this formula is not simple enough we can approximate further: If is close to then is close to (second order taylor approximation*), so we can simplify the formula to: 

One very easy method to determine the MA of a pulley system is the T-method: You assume that you pull with one unit of tension. Next you assume each contiguous section has the same amount of tension and you can easily determine them all step by step. (A more detailed explanation can be found here.) In this case this would look like so: 

CamelBak have a great answer in the help section of their website. Summarising their recommendations: Keep it clean and dry when not in use. If mould develops: 

I am assuming that, as you moved out of the snow field you were also descending, therefore, I think it is more likely you were experiencing altitude sickness and your symptoms reversed as you descended. The presence/absence of snow was purely coincidental. Dehydration contributes to altitude sickness through, 

If you're not having fun, figure out why and fix it for next time. As you gain experience things will become easier and you'll have more fun. 

If it's raining or very humid you are probably going to have to put up with some condensation, but to try and reduce it, look for ways to minimise water vapour and increase ventilation. The following may help, but obviously not all will be appropriate for the conditions you are camping in. Sources of water vapour: 

lower air density which increases respiration and, therefore, water loss, and lower air pressure which increases evaporation of moisture from the skin. 

The obvious thing to consider would be how loud the whistle is. The loudest I've found is the Lifesystems survival whistle which, at 122dB, claims to be "the world's most powerful whistle." I'm not sure I agree with choosing metal whistles, as in freezing temperatures they would be quite uncomfortable to use. As regards durability, the plastic whistle I bought about 20 years ago is still in good condition. 

Even this approximation of the coefficient is quite nonlinear so it is not possible to make a statement x grains equal y fps. In the following graph you can see the relationship between the ratio of the two velocities and the ratio of the masses. 

(First of all: I'm not used to the english words here.) I think tillering trees refere to the contraptiosn you do mount on walls / something standing upright, using a string and a pulley. But you can easily do the same with just a tillering stick which is quite easy to fabricate, I think following images say more than I can say in words. All you need is a little piece of lumber, at preferably longer than your draw length, and cut some notches in it. That way you can put the bow into the top notch and continuously pull the string back step by step, lean in on a wall, take some steps back in order to observe the shape. This is important as you usually cannot observe it that well when you're still having it in you hands. The procedure is exactly the same as when using a tillering tree. As far as I'm aware this is the standard tool. 

The loop allows the gloves to be hung, on a carabiner for example, such that the fingers point up preventing the gloves filling with rain or snow. For example, see the manufacturer's description of these gloves: 

Personally, I would use a wind chill chart, e.g this keyring compass includes a wind chill chart that would be easy to carry. It's still not going to be accurate, but it would provide a guide when you have nothing better. Take a look at the Wikipedia page on wind chill, the calculations look a bit "frightening" - not something I would like to do in my head. 

This article (*) gives a good summary of the efficiency of boiling as a method for making water safe for consumption. In particular, Table 2 provides a summary of the temperature and time required to kill various micro-organisms. A distinction should be drawn between killing all pathogens and making water safe to drink. Sterilisation of water (killing all living containments) is not necessary to make water safe to drink. For example, boiling may not be effective against bacterial spores such as Clostridium which can survive at 100Â°C (212Â°F), however, as Clostridium is not an enteric (intestinal) pathogen, ingestion will not cause infection. All enteric pathogens are quickly killed above 60Â°C (140Â°F), therefore, although boiling is not necessary to make the water safe to drink, the time taken to heat the water to boiling is usually sufficient to reduce pathogens to safe levels. Allowing the boiled water to cool slowly will also extend the exposure of enteric pathogens to lethal temperatures. Boiling also gives a simple visual indicator that a high enough temperature has been reached when a thermometer is not available. (*) Backer, H.
