Practice idea - find a large open flat concrete area with no traffic, and lay out some lines with pavement chalk. Try and jump them, and the chalk should show exactly how far you got. Practice. 

No - that'd be like putting a Toyota rally driver into a F1 car, on race day. You'll be able to ride, but you won't be used to the nuances, as david1024 says, BUMSTEER. Road bikes need at least a week to get used to, and I went 500 km of riding in a month, before becoming comfortable on a road bike after being on MTBs for years. And I still go downhills faster on the MTB than on the road bike. You can prep your existing ride by removing non-essential weight like mudguards and lights. Go for new tyres with mostly slick tread rather than knobblies, and go for the higher end of the safe working pressure in the tubes. Lock out any suspension if you can do so. Or if you're liking road riding, do consider buying a road bike. I know they're stupid prices new, but riding is still cheaper than other addictions like smoking and drinking :) A good used road bike could be more within your reach. Consider several months practice if you're moving to cleats or changing cleat systems too. Finally, remember cyclists want to own N+1 bikes.... 

If you do wound an animal to the point it can't get away but is still in pain, then "putting it out of its misery" may be a bad idea. Smart animals can fake it to draw you close, and then lash out. The dog's companions may use this as a distraction to attack you from the other side. Your top priority is you. 

Take the bike outside. If you have a leather saddle, remove it. If you have a bike computer then remove that too, as well as any bags or tools. Rinse the bike with a shower setting on your hose. Do not use any sort of jet. use biodegradable dishwash and warm water along with a car-cleaning cloth, or an old dish brush. Get the soapy water into every crevasse and cranny. There are a lot of them. An old toothbrush helps too. Then rinse the dirty soapy water off, and see the areas you missed. Repeat the soapy bit on those areas. Once the bike is rinsed off, dry it in the sunlight. Then you need to relubricate the chain using a suitable chain lube. 

This is how V Brakes should look when assembled. The rubber Boot will slide to the right, and you will see a hole in the noodle holder that holds the noodle. It should take a bit of squeezing on the Arms to get it all fitting through. Once its all assembled, you should be able to squeeze the brake lever up on the bars, and the two arms will lean-in at the same rate, and then pull off at the same rate and offset. Shouldn't have one arm moving a lot more than the other. This can be adjusted iteratively with the Spring Tension Screw on the bottom of both brake arms. 

You've given the cause in your first sentence. I've got a cheap new rear wheel. Cheap wheels tend to be not as good as better wheels. So the bearing surfaces are not quite as exact in their tolerances as a more refined hub. Is it possible that you have swapped the cones side-for-side ? At these scales, its impossible to see visually whether its the cup or the cone which is out. Lastly - did you change the bearings? Are they the right size? Are they all the same size? You might be better to simply replace all the bearings with new ones, that way they're the same batch and thus size. Rear wheel hubs should be 1/4" bearings (about 9), and front wheels are 3/16" (about 10) I'm guessing you have loose ones, rather than those in a retainer. Either is fine, loose ones are more fiddly but technically better. The bearings looking like they are on top of each other is probably happening as you unscrew the cone, not while its spinning. There is simply not room for a whole bearing to jump another one, even when its got a lot of play. 

Nice shopping list. You'll need a new chain too - theres no saving putting your existing used chain onto brand new everything else. Personally I'd go for the long cage because it allows more difference between smallest and largest cog in the cassette. As an all-purpose rider I want a 12~28 or 12-30 cassette with a triple on the front. However as a tri rider you might never do climbs, so flat-land speed would be better developed using a corncob cassette, where the tooth count changes by 1 between cogs - you could have 11-22 in steps of 1 tooth for optimum cadence. Finally, 105 is still good, so don't shelve it. You could consider putting it on a training bike, or passing it on to someone else. I still ride a 3x7 speed road bike! 

I have an old steel coffee-table leg screwed to the wall of my carport by the flanges at the top of the leg. It holds about 6 random rims normally, and sticks out slightly upwards To get more space and protect the nicer aluminium ones, I use a length of ribbon or soft rope like sash cord. This goes around the rim and is tied in a loop with ~100 mm of slack. Then the loop is hooked over the leg and left to hang. Works well for me. Advantage - soft cloth is in contact with the rim. Downside - its still hanging by the rim. 

That's a lot of work to cut off the old seat stays and weld in new ones. Plus you'd have to either cut them off an existing bike, or make the new seat stays up out of fresh steel. Getting it done by an experienced and qualified framebuilder would be safest, but I'd be surprised if it was cheaper than a whole new bike. The details of your suspension aren't obvious from your question - can you add a pic showing what you want to try? Do you have rim or disk brakes? With rim brakes, the bosses will have to line up correctly, and with disk brakes it depends if your rear caliper is mounted to the seat or chain stay. Doubt that you have caliper brakes. Remember, in 2003 a 2.1" tyre was huge. Noone anticipated tyres would become bigger-than-huge. Your final option might be to trim your tyres a bit - removing some of the knobs might help fit in the frame. Or simply return to 2.2" or 2.1" tyres. I'd strongly advise AGAINST trying to cold-set your frame with any sort of jack or puller - that is likely to crease the frame and decrease the structural strength required. 

I am a big guy at 100 KG, (was bigger 120 when I started biking) and we have one advantage while braking - which is ballast, or weight transferance. The most braking you can do is 100% on the front to the point where the rear wheel has almost zero weight. Any more braking and you're over the handlebars and/or the rear wheel is going some direction its not supposed to. So, get your backside off the seat, stretch out your arms, and stick your bum out. Hang it out the back like you're mooning someone behind you. Drop your shoulders as well, and brake hard on the front brake. If you feel yourself rotating forward, modulate your tension on the front brake lever. This is the most effective braking you can do on a bike, regardless of the brake type. Maximum duration should be about half a minute, the limiting factor here is the temperature of the rim/pads leads to brake fade on a long downhill. 

New ball bearings will cost less than a new wheel - the order of $5 for a bag. It may be that your bearings are okay just mal-adjusted so there may be no cost for parts. You'll need a cone spanner and a conventional spanner, some grease, and cleaning gear (rags/ solvent like petrol or whatever) Since its the rear wheel, you'll need the special tool to remove your cassette/freewheel as well. Even buying one of these its still cheaper than replacing the wheel. This is a good start: 

I've used a short length cut from a steel pipe in the past. As long as the Inner Diameter is barely more than the OD of the axle it will center well enough. The pipe's wall needs to be thick enough to not crumple under pressure. The only trick is to make sure your cut is parallel to the end, and that it is nicely de-burred and any raw steel is painted with zinc primer, or well greased to prevent rust. 

Wear trousers/pants. I have always worn full length trousers while riding, normally over padded shorts or bib shorts. This provides some abrasion protection in the event of a slide. If you're wearing workpants then the thorns etc won't hook in. Downside is heat - so wear a light colour to decrease the insolation and perhaps a thinner fabric for cooling. Bonus - I have pockets for my small stuff, and a belt on which to hang my leatherman. (and there's the advantage I can get off the bike and look vaguely normal, rather than scaring people with my.... cycling equipment.... ) 

If you still haven't got it working, give up and chuck it out. Instead, get the strava app and run that on your fancyphone. Not only will it log your ride, it'll let you compare your segments with others. You may need a handlebar mount for your phone, this is a downside. Plus my phone only gets 4hours life, so I need a power brick battery too. $URL$
