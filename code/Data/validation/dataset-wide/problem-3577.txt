What really helped me understand proper back arch without overextension was this Kelly Starrett / Mobility Workout of the Day video. The key idea is just this: squeeze your glutes (your butt). That's the big trick. Arch your back, tighten the abs and the spinal erectors and retract the shoulderblades, but squeeze your butt. This mostly prevents an over-arching lower back. 

If you run and do BJJ and want to increase your strength, particularly your explosive strength, by far your best bet is to start using external resistance tools: dumbbells, barbells, or kettlebells. The Olympic lifts (the snatch, clean, and jerk, with any of those tools) and their adjuncts (the squat, deadlift, press, push press, and so on) are the best tools for developing strength and explosiveness. Bodyweight methods for explosiveness include sprints, box jumps, leaps, and clapping push-ups. For general strength using bodyweight, your plan looks fine, though I'd add dips to the pull-ups, push-ups, planches, and handstands. 

When I split my workouts, I try to classify the exercises so that I don't over-do any one thing in the same session. For instance, doing both overhead and bench press is an enormous amount of pressing work and should probably be separated. Exercise Classifications 

If your goal is general fitness then you're doing plenty of running, walking, and swimming, but your deadlift is quite light. Sixteen reps is also a lot for the deadlift. If it's possible to use more weight but fewer reps per set, do that. 60kg to 100kg should be entirely doable for you within a few months. Other ways to get good use out of your limited weights are Turkish get-ups, overhead presses, and kettlebell swings and snatches. The swings are a good alternative if you don't have the equipment to deadlift heavy.

(Since I know nothing about the knee injury, I am considering your lower body out of the picture for working out.) Take this as an opportunity to work the hell out of your upper body. Do pull-ups, chin-ups, push-ups, Hindu push-ups, bench presses, overhead presses, handstands, handstand push-ups, dips. Buy or make a sandbag and practice throwing and heaving it around. If you specifically want "cardio", try making a circuit routine out of a few of these (for instance, alternating between a pushing and pulling exercises) and do a set number of rounds or a set amount of time. 

If doing a program similar to StrongLifts is important to you, consider buying the Starting Strength book and following its program. It is similar to StrongLifts, but more detailed and includes the power clean. Also consider following an Olympic-lifting-specific program, like something from Catalyst Athletics (see other resources from them) or the Glenn Pendlay beginner program. It's possible to lift more than 3 times a week. It's possible to do Olympic lifting as a focus or as a supplement to basic strength lifts. There's no need to restrict yourself. 

Disclaimer: I'm not an expert in bag work or boxing. The amount of rest you can take between sessions is entirely dependent on the intensity of your bag work, your recovery, and your conditioning. There's no overarching answer other than to start the first few sessions light and short before gradually building up to hard 20-minute workouts. The first few times you should stop before you feel wiped out and before you tweak something. Since bag work can be tough on a new person's joints in addition to the cardio aspect, be careful and don't try to hit the bag as hard as you can your first few times. Work technique and later, over several workouts, add power. Personally I'm on the lookout for joint pain across the entire upper body chain--wrist, elbow, shoulder. 

Dumbbells are an excellent choice for bench and overhead pressing. For deadlifts they're kind of not great, because it gets awkward as soon as it gets heavy. I'd do lots of Romanian dumbbell deadlifts, or dumbbell power cleans, instead. For squats, I'd do lunges with dumbbells before I'd do the Smith machine. That his is just not right. 

Do the original workout described above, heavy squats and pull-ups Five round circuit of 20 air squats, 15 sit-ups, and 10 push-ups 

Don't "Stretch" Doing static stretches before working out is not good. It cools you down and relaxes you, which is the opposite of what you want while you're exerting yourself. What's worse is that by stretching your muscles, you decrease the amount of force that your muscles can exert, and make yourself vulnerable to injuries like muscle pulls. Static stretches--where you put your muscle into a stretch and hold it there for several seconds or longer--is not a good idea before pull-ups. Warm Up Instead, do a thorough warm-up and some dynamic stretches. What I do before pull-ups is from Tom Kurz' Stretching Scientifically. Basically I briefly roll out my joints (wrists, elbows, shoulders, hips, ankles, neck), then move for five minutes. Sometimes I go for a jog, sometimes I jump rope, sometimes I shadowbox. Some people use a stationary bike--it doesn't matter what you do, as long as it's not too strenuous or explosive and it gets your blood pumping. Then I do three sets of arm circles both forward and backward, to make sure my shoulder joint is ready to be stressed. (If my workout includes lower body work, I do leg swings as well for my hips.) 

The gist is to get mobile and strong in the hips while simultaneously developing skill and balance for the one-legged squat. 

I squat and deadlift with a barbell regularly. I know how much I can lift with variants of those exercises on a given day. I'd like to use that knowledge to better understand how much I should expect to lift with a weighted lunge. What is the normative ratio between a lifter's squat and their lunge? We know these relationships, in broad strokes and with some caveats, between other lifts. The front squat and back squat, the squat and the deadlift, the deadlift and the power clean, and so on all have known relationships consisting of a range of ratios. For instance, a power clean between 40 and 60 percent of one's deadlift is to be expected, and most people's front squat is generally about 80% of their back squat. So: what lunge is to be expected if one can squat X? Any type of loaded squat and any type of loaded lunge is acceptable, but please be specific: e.g. "barbell back squat to forward-stepping lunge with a barbell across the shoulders" or "barbell front squat to rearward-stepping lunge with dumbbells in the hands". Anecdotes welcome but data welcome more. 

(This is somewhat harder. That might be a good thing.) In addition, coming to a complete stop and pause at the bottom helps me minimize swinging, as does pulling myself up slower (which makes them harder, which might be good or bad depending on circumstance). 

The StrongLifts report, page 48, says the 5x5-to-3x5 switch often occurs around a squat of 200 pounds: 

Stop squatting for a couple weeks. Go to a coach who knows the squat inside and out, and have them do an extensive form check. (This would entail a significant deload.) 

You can't get better at running by walking. If you can't run 2km then at least run for 30 seconds, then rest while walking, then run again, and so on. Look up "couch to 5k" schedules to see examples of regimented programs for this kind of thing. For the push-ups, do negative push-ups instead of knee push-ups. Lower yourself to the ground, rest for a moment, then get to the top any way you can. Try to get to 100 total sit-ups in as few sets as possible. Don't stop at 20. Be aware that this is quite a short period to go from your current abilities to the abilities the test requires. 

Testing the efficacy of conditioning workouts usually rests on measuring the output of the workout, i.e. X per time unit, where X can be watts, miles, punches thrown, whatever. More vague methods of tracking progress include feeling fresh at the end of a workout, or being able to complete a given workout more quickly, being able to shorten rest periods, or being able to complete more rounds. Of course these all depend on maintaining a constant work output. Resting heart rate is another possibility for longer-term tracking of conditioning capability. With your specific example of bag work, there's also the traditional method of testing boxing conditioning: spar a few rounds, or take a fight. There are more complex tests as well, which involve measuring heart rate or other indicators, or even looking at daily blood work. 

Briefly My deadlift is great and my squat sucks. I want to continue squatting 3x5 more and more weight while I keep my deadlift where it is. What's the best way to maintain my deadlift strength with a minimum of training time and recovery resources so I can focus efforts on my squat? Details I'm male, 5'10'' tall, and weigh approximately 170-175 pounds, though I'm working on moving up to 180 or 185. I keep pretty good food quality but occasionally under-eat at lunch. I recently PR'd my deadlift at 385x2, and can hit a hard set of 5 in the mid-300s. My front squat is primary: I am not currently working on my back squat because of form issues and because I think it's not necessary, but for background I can back squat 225 for reps, probably 240 or so for a max. My front squat has progressed nicely from ~165 to 215 by doing 3 sets of 5, increasing weight every other workout. Once or twice I've been forced to do a 3x3 workout before graduating to 3x5. Those misses were due to poor recovery combined with foolishly adding weight as scheduled. I lift two or three times a week, with two to four days a week of judo, moderate hiking and swimming, sprints, or Ultimate. Lifting sessions currently go as follows: 

Yes, the bar should land on the meaty part of your shoulders with the fingertips of your open hands literally just helping balance. Catching it with your hands prevents the use of heavy weights and increases the chance of injury (by elbowing your own thigh, by stressing the elbow or shoulder, or by off-balancing you forward causing stress on the back or a drop). The two biggest fixes that sound appropriate for you are 

Properly executed weight training will increase, not decrease, your flexibility and mobility. Use full-range-of-motion exercises such as dead-hang pull-ups, below-parallel barbell squats, and deadlifts. Lifting heavy and eating a lot of food will cause you to gain weight. Swimming and kickboxing will make that progress slower. How you structure your workouts--more kickboxing, less lifting, or vice versa--is an indicator of your goals. It sounds like you want to gain mass, but only lean mass. If that's your requirement, keep in mind that your progress will be even slower and even more difficult than a program designed for increasing strength and mass. You say you're eating 6 meals a day, but how big are they? How many calories are you getting in?
