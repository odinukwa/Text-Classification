Realistically everyone in general has intentionally or unintentionally done evil deeds, so it's best to develop those four things. 

I also believe that in the past I practiced mind-exercises in early pre-ancient Egypt a long long time ago, which unconsciously unknowingly I revived now in modern times. It seems that the earlier Egyptians were highly interested in mind-exercises and meditation, many from that time are now here during this time-period. Also sometimes I see spirits of deceased relatives, heavenly and hellish beings. Certainly this extreme form of enjoyment is the greatest gain, greatest pleasure, the only noteworthy goal in life. 

This is not true, The Buddha did not say that one only achieves nirvana (the highest happiness) after renouncing the world. Arahantship or enlightenment is caused by the ending of mental fermentations, defilements, pains, hankers, cankers (asavas), not from merely giving up worldly possessions (this is something repeated throughout the Pali canons). There were lots of people during The Buddha's time who gave up worldly possessions but did not achieve arahantship. When Siddartha Gautama did severe austerities (like starving) he found that it had no benefits and just made him weak. When he started eating again after regaining his strength he found it easier to concentrate, but his enlightenment came only after the ending of mental fermentations (asavas). The Buddha discovered the "Middle way" in between the extremes of austerities and the extremes of a worldly life. The rules for monks are there to help one achieve arahantship in this lifetime, but arahantship won't come until the ending of mental fermentations, defilements, pains, cankers, taints, hankers (asavas). When you go too much into the extremes of austerities it becomes difficult to end mental fermentations and when you go too much into the extremes of a worldly life it becomes difficult to end mental fermentations. So it's the "Middle way". In the Cula-dhammasamadana Sutta (MN 45) The Buddha describes: 

The Brahma worlds are full of pleasure and last for such an extremely extremely long time that it is often mistaken as eternal by many but eventually the Brahma worlds come to an end (it's a temporary heavenly world, so it's not a solution to ending suffering). Maha Brahma is extremely powerful so He is often mistaken as all-powerful, all-knowing, etc... Most likely Judaism, Christianity, and Islam (and other religions that speak of a Creator god that existed in the beginning of the universe) came from the Brahma worlds or beings influenced by the Brahma worlds. The reason why many morals in Judeo-Christian-Islamic religions resemble Buddhism is because they lead towards the Brahma worlds which is viewed as one of the best possible destinations, but still below the Pure Abodes and nibbana. In order to get into the Brahma worlds one has to be extremely virtuous and loving or enter higher meditative states (jhanas). Maha Brahma and other Brahma-beings are viewed as mostly good and closer in accordance to the dhamma than most. Maha Brahma and other extremely powerful beings in this universe-system are still influenced by the Evil One (Mara, Satan), and still experience sorrow, anger, etc...unlike arahants and Buddhas. There is a story in the Brahma-nimantanika Sutta (MN 49) where the Evil One possesses followers of Brahma to say something like "Don't defy Brahma otherwise you'll go to hell" just like many modern day followers do. The Evil One (Mara, Satan) prefers that people go to the temporary Brahma worlds rather than achieve arahantship knowing that it's temporary. The Buddha says to a Brahma-being "Thus I am not your mere equal in terms of direct knowing, so how could I be inferior? I am actually superior to you" (Brahma-nimantanika Sutta, MN 49). The Unborn / Nibbana: 

A simple exercise is to simply count. You can do this anytime your concentration isn't needed for another activity- while walking, riding the bus, etc. Some people recommend aligning your counting with the breath, but I often found, when I did that, I'd just lapse into a dull, rhythmic counting that didn't really help me learn to concentrate, just to go into a kind of droning stupor. But if you mentally count, a new number every few seconds, not rhythmically but a little bit randomly, then your mind stays alert and alive to your surroundings, while training your mind to not go off into daydreams or worries. Because you can always tell exactly when you lose the thread, it really helps build the "mindfulness" muscle, and helps train you to be attentive and resilient. It will set you up well if you want to study any other meditation techniques. Just one thing to keep in mind: the point isn't to learn how to count well :) If you lose track, it is OK: just start over again, with no judgment. 

I don't know your situation and haven't suffered anything like it, so any advice I have may mean nothing to you, but I will say these things: 

There are times when there's nothing to do but watch. Put aside the expectations for yourself gained by reading the Dhamma. Unwise attention, in this case, would include reading about arahants and then judging yourself for not being like them. Just focus on what is right here. Focus on the doubt itself, or on the body, and the feelings in the body created by the negative emotions - the constricted breath, the aches and tensions, the agitation, the rushing thoughts. Resolve to sit, but don't expect anything from the sitting- just put in the time. If chanting feels like a chore, just sit instead. Find some small, easy, thing to do that is useful, or is kind and helpful to someone else, and do that. Or just sit still and count to 100, if that's all you can manage. These are all wise and skillful actions and are Dhamma. If you just do your best to not nourish the already-arisen thoughts, then you are practicing Dhamma. You're experiencing an emotional flood, created by long-past circumstances. The flood is pulling away your energy and faith. Wise attention, in this case, is to let the flood wash through, watch your energy and faith fade away, and stay aware. Later, the energy and faith will return - it is inevitable- and you will have have strength again to nourish new, increased faith and energy, but for now, just do what you can. 

Don't try to force a classic meditation object while you're doing work (or relating to other people, generally). Do your work, and just practice coming back to your task every time your mind wanders. If you can slow down mind-wandering and ruminative thinking in your regular life, you will be well set-up to concentrate when you meditate formally. You'll never be able to make regular life the same as meditation. But the insights from calm and meditation will start to feed back into your regular life. When you start to feel spontaneous, uncaused, calm happiness and physical comfort while meditating, you are either near, or in, jhana. You may have already experienced this. People are often "better" at meditation than they think they are. Try not to feel bullied by intra-Buddhist arguments about what exactly jhana is, and accept these as signs that your practice is good, and as motivation to keep going. When you have firm confidence within yourself in your practice, then you can start to explore the details of exactly what jhana is. 

But with making an end to mental fermentations, why would you be concerned about managing another's anger? Happy, angerless, fearless, doubtless, sorrowless, becomes the one who's put an end to mental fermentations, such an extreme form of pleasure. 

Being attached to the end result makes it much harder to achieve your goal. If you really want to achieve your goal you should focus on achieving it without attachment, and in ways in accordance to the goal. Just imagine how extraordinarily easy achieving a goal like this would be for someone who really was an arahant. Thus you should train yourself towards achieving the final goal. 

I doubt the advice was for health purposes even if it may improve health. It was probably to improve self-discipline for monks and is stated as a sign of a monk's virtue: 

It is not clear if The Buddha died from eating pork or mushrooms (sukara-maddava). But it was obviously intentional or planned out (since according to the sutta no one else in the universe would be able to eat such a thing and entirely digest it). It is clear that The Buddha did not support vegetarianism. He opposed directly killing animals (hunting, fishing, etc...) but eating meat that wasn't directly killed by you or naturally died is allowed. He also opposed damaging plant and seed life. He also pointed out that ascetic practices (which includes avoiding eating meat, drinking alcohol, etc...) are painful in the present and yield pain in the future (MN 45), they lead to hell or lower destinations as explained because they simply torment one's body without causing one to achieve arahantship or higher states (jhanas). Vegetarianism fits into the category of an ascetic practice that by itself doesn't cause one to achieve arahantship or higher states (jhanas). A vegetarian who hasn't ended their mental fermentations is still a non-arahant. A vegetarian who does evil deeds is still an evil doer. Practices are only helpful if they lead towards arahantship (the ending of mental fermentations).

Rebirth is real and eventually will be proven, as is the afterlife (with heavenly and hellish worlds). As The Buddha explained: 

Certainly a variation of meditative techniques may be effective, but modern science has shown that massage therapy effectively reduces aggression (see $URL$ I've found that monitoring bodily feelings helps you trace the root of the negative thoughts. So try monitoring your negative bodily feelings then massaging that area, it seems to work well temporarily (not but permanently). I've attempted to trace where my negative bodily feelings come from (which causes me have negative thoughts, say negative things, and take negative actions) and I've traced it to early negative childhood experiences (from around age 5 or earlier). It seems that these early negative memories stay inside of us unconsciously, unknowingly until death unless we do something about it. In order to permanently end the pains you have to deal with the negative memories associated with those bodily feelings which is more complicated. 

Are you using a posture that is too strenuous for you? For example, trying to sit in a lotus position, when you have never done it before? If so, use an easier posture: 

Strictly speaking, Buddhism doesn't say "desire" is the cause of suffering, but that craving rooted in attachment is the cause of suffering. Sometimes scientific curiosity is rooted in attachment, but other times it's rooted in wholesome motives such as compassion. Often the motives are a combination of the two. So I think Buddhism is silent on this question. It's up to each inquirer to evaluate their motives, moment to moment. 

What you see, in this case, are visual thoughts- they're the same as verbal thoughts. They arise due to untraceable prior causes that are outside of your control, and they can't really be stopped. Mental and verbal thoughts are both "sankhara", conditioned formations. We are all VERY strongly conditioned in our lives to grasp on to these formations, to "believe" them, and turn them in to ideas and visions and further thoughts. When you focus on your breath (or any other meditation object), you're focusing on something real- something you "feel", like you said- but, unlike thoughts and visions, it's something that doesn't feed more grasping. Each time your attention goes to your object, you slowly loosen the grip that these conditioned formations have on your attention. So there's no need to place the attention of the "inner eye" anywhere. Acknowledge and accept that these visual images arise, then put them aside. Later on, you'll start to see how visual and verbal thoughts are both the product of the same movements of the mind. These movements mean nothing in themselves- they're just disturbances, like swirls of milk in a stirred-up cup of coffee- but our storehouse of memories and perceptions fill those swirls with powerful symbolism and apparent meaning. 

It is good to be consistent, but the most important factor is confidence that you're doing the right thing, regardless of which method you choose. Check out the "five hindrances"- the list of five tendencies that subside as you approach jhana. They are: 

I won't try to guess exactly what you're experiencing, but one thing that trips people up a lot is the expectation that meditation is a one-way road to greater and greater calm. In reality, there's an initial calming, followed by the emergence of various kinds of experiences at other layers of the mind, some of which are pleasant or orderly, some of which aren't. One thing that Buddhism teaches is that the mind is a sixth sense alongside vision, hearing, touch, taste, and smell. This means that thoughts and mental imagery are on the same level as sights and sounds- they are data that enters through "your" doors of perception from "outside". They don't belong to you and are largely out of your control. This is contrary to our usual Cartesian model of thinking that our Thoughts are the expression of our core Self, and it's also contrary to the common idea of meditation as the conscious quieting of all thoughts. I only have my own experience to go on, but I believe that the ability to achieve a complete stilling of the roiling, random soup of images in our minds is very very rare, if it exists at all, and not a requisite for good practice.
