That's 11 pounds of chocolate. Eleven pounds. "Carob is more nutritious and requires less sugar than chocolate." Well, taking some nutrition facts from some 15g of Sunspire unsweetened carob chips (presumably similar to what you'd replace chocolate with): 

I'll not delve into the whole "debate" between people who think significant amounts of weight loss can occur from other things than diet modification and exercise. Instead there's some simple proof on his own website that the picture isn't coming from his low-sleep "Paleo+" diet alone. Quote from his article discussing his 4500 Calorie diet comments section: 

So, does it? Well, I couldn't find a solid source evaluating sugar levels alone. The American Journal of Nursing has published recommendations that encourage giving constipated patients a lot of fruit juice (4 glasses per day of just about any juice). However, since fruit juice will introduce both sugar and water into your system, it's not conclusive. Maybe a better question to ask after reading that is: "Does sugar have an effect on hydration levels?" since hydration levels definitely have an effect on constipation, with some research suggesting even mild dehydration could exacerbate things. During periods of hypohydration, the body cannot properly lubricate itself, and it can easily progress to constiptaion. Does increasing your sugar intake affect your hydration levels? Only if you eat enough to result in high blood-sugar levels. Diabetics are more at risk, naturally. Do bananas gain a significant amount of sugar as they ripen? One study suggests... barely: 

So what does Chris Masterjohn (who is apparently a PhD student at the University of Connecticut) say? 

"Toxins" in the context of homeopathy/alternative medicine aren't real and are not harbored in the body. Therefore any "cure" is just as fake. Your colon does not accumulate detritus or poisons, and any blockage or accumulation is pathological. Chelating agents are used to bind heavy metals in vivo before they are excreted, and I'm not aware of any mechanism involving the common components of clay which would act in a similar fashion - though ingesting clay would certainly introduce heavy metals into your system if the clay contained them. If you are DEFICIENT in Zinc, consumption of Zinc can increase immune system effectiveness if it is part of the clay. Vitamin D promotes Calcium absorption. However, the clay may contain Calcium - introducing more to your overall intake. Clay does not enter your blood, where acidosis would take place. Positively charged ions might help if they found their way into the bloodstream (Calcium, Sodium, Potassium) if the clay contained them. From an article from the Royal Society of Medicine on Geophagia (eating dirt): 

Also very noteworthy is that the image on the right below, who is purported to be "Ann Dunham" - isn't actually in the magazine, which you can find high res images for via the link above. 

Yes, of course it's possible. It's one of the best ways to extract compounds in chemical workups via separating funnels: 

Well, after a quick search it seems that Stephen Colbert is probably correct. First, it's good to mention that according to the Department of Justice most Voter Fraud will fall under state jurisdiction and not Federal jurisdiction unless there are threats or discrimination based on race, religion, or national origin. There is a popular figure oft-cited by The Daily Show and other sources who make arguments against certain Voter ID laws, which is 10 cases of "in-person" Voter ID fraud over the last decade or so. This seems technically correct, according to this article by ABC: 

Human's can't hear that low in the first place. In case you didn't click any of the above, the range of the human ear is usually between 20Hz and 20kHz, but can be as low as 12Hz. You can't hear any of your Delta brainwaves. 

TL:DR - No. The answer to this question is basically going to be "Does more sugar contribute to constipation?" A brief explanation from Sciencebuddies.org: 

By itself? No. When paired with a workout regime? Yes. The purpose of Whey Protein (or indeed, any complete protein source) as a supplement is to be utilized in lean-tissue anabolism (growth). In order for muscle mass to increase, there must be three things present: 1) Significant stress on the muscles, either increased weight or increased length of activity. 2) Protein to build the new cellular structures. 3) An excess Caloric intake (lest your body simply deconstruct the new muscle for energy instead of retaining it). Whey Powder, or other sources of complete protein supplements, addresses #2. While Protein supplements do contain Calories, unless the workout is short, you will burn more energy than the supplement contains. A Placebo-controlled study has shown the following: 

(2*130) = Unpopped 260 Calories (13*15) = Popped 195 Calories So it is at least true that popcorn nutrition labels show a difference between popped and unpopped (here: 25% difference). If we're to take Micah's article, the average percentage of unpopped kernels after microwaving is between 4% and 47%, or 25.5%. So it fits very well with the data available. I'd say it's perfectly reasonable to think that the difference is due to the average number of unpopped kernels after cooking. 

Ethanol is the alcohol in all alcoholic beverages (not to be confused with methanol, which is very toxic), acetic acid is the main component of vinegar, and lactic acid is used in anaerobic respiration within your muscles while exercising. So as far as "carcinogens" - not from the fermentation product. That's not to say that cocoa/chocolate doesn't contain any carcinogens - there are dozens of compounds in almost everything we eat, but are there any in significant quantities in cocoa? Well, probably not: 

It's fake. Here's a screencap I took, and the arrows are pointing at the fishing line or piece of thread he's using to manipulate the objects. As for the Gamma waves... The best description I found was from "Epilepsy & Behavior" Vol. 13 Iss. 1: [Gamma brainwaves] have been studied in all sensory systems and are associated with selective attention, transient binding of cognitive features, and conscious perception of the external world. Which is to say, after spending 45 minutes on Google Scholar, it might be simple concentration that causes Gamma waves to spike. 

No doubt you noticed, though, that Stewart and other critics of Voter ID laws specifically mention cases that Voter ID laws would have prevented - although the total amount of Voter Fraud is higher. Is it enough to matter? Well according to Google's statistics the difference in votes between the candidates was 3,378,662. A much closer race is the infamous 2000 Elections, where the FEC's statistics show a difference of 350,428 between the Democrat and Republican candidates. It would have taken 7,009 cases of voter fraud per state in 2000 to make that gap, and over 67,500 cases of voter fraud per state to close the gap in 2012. I could not find a source for the total cases of voter fraud, but one of PolitiFact's articles attempts to address this: 

However, how much additional protein is necessary can be difficult to determine, as this study in the Journal of Applied Physiology takes the time to research: 

A similarly unspectacular result was also found in another study (direct-download PDF) where, after a day or two of reaching their ethylene peak, the production of sugars reached a plateu. So, the differences between ripe and overripe bananas is going to be minimal. Both will contain about 17g-18g of sugars when the banana is 8"-9" long, and have roughly similar Calorie counts. The sugar content differences are further nullified when you remember that humans can digest starches, so any conversion of starches into monomers by the fruit is only making the fruit quicker to digest (and explains why overripe bananas have a higher Glycemic index). It's removing a step the body takes anyways. Ultimately, no - the ripeness of a banana has no affect on constipation under normal hydration levels. If you're eating enough sugar to affect your hydration levels, switching to a less-ripe banana won't help you since the body will net similar amounts of total sugar once it converts the starch into glucose. 

They also go on to say that News21 found 307 cases of Voter Fraud (en totale, including Impersonation) in Georgia - which is 6x higher than Texas and over 10x higher than Pennsylvania (who News21 said had 29 cases). The Republican National Lawyer's Association challenged the analysis, saying Georgia had 375 cases. Given that I've no baseline or average to work from, but Georgia appears to be one of the more rampant offenders - every state in the nation would have to have eighteen times the amount of voter fraud that Georgia had in a single year to make up the gap in the 2000 elections. It would take over 9,000-fold Georgia's cases per state in 2012 alone to have made up the gap in the 2012 elections. Basically, even if all states had as much voter fraud as the RNLA said Georgia had per year (which they don't), it would still only represent .0155% of the total vote. I'd agree with Stephen Colbert and other pundits; for all intents and purposes, Voter Fraud is practically a non-issue. 

If you're still iffy, here's another comparison between the only character dressed like the mysterious woman above and Ann Dunham herself (taken at a US Embassy): 

TL;DR version: Yes, you could say carob is healthier than chocolate. However, I wouldn't call it a "health food" since the difference isn't large and carob isn't exactly a nutritional powerhouse. I'll try to address your concerns one by one, since you make a lot: "Cocoa is fermented and contains carcinogens" "The first stage of chocolate production consists of... fermentation." 

So, nutritionally speaking, carob does win out. It is ~10% less energy dense and has more Calcium, Sodium, and Dietary Fiber. Though, it's worth it to point out that the 15g of carob chips above only contribute 8% of your Calcium, 2% of your Sodium, and 8% of your Dietary Fiber according to FDA recommendations - making Carob/Cocoa/Chocolate a fairly minor contributor to the overall nutritional makeup of the foods you (ideally) eat.
