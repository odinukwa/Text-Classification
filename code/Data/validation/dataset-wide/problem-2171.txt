Bob is a leach. He wants you to do his project because he can't. If you help him out, he will get all the credit if it succeeds and you will get all the blame if it doesn't. You don't need to worry about whether you need to have a good relationship to Bob as it appears that most of the organization already knows he is failing. Where you have a an actual problem is your manager. He appears to be wishy washy and unable to set firm boundaries, expecting you to handle this issue on your own. You need to have a talk to him about this project. Tell him directly that you don't want to work with Bob if possible as he recommended. Ask him to put it in writing that you have other assignments and do not have the time available to work on Bob's project. At your level, you will just get the blame if you don't work for Bob unless your boss gives you a direct order not to. Also ask him to talk to Alice about your performance and contract to counteract specifically what Bob may have said. If you end up not being able to avoid working with Bob, then you need to clearly document what specific things you were asked to work on. (and pushback in writing including a copy to your boss if the things assigned are more than you can do in the time frame.) You need to be the one to demo those things and you need to do them to the best of your ability. Even if he gets the credit, not getting the blame is better for you than the blame you will get if things do not succeed. Use project management tools and commits to show that you did what you were assigned and met your deadlines. Prepare a document showing this and give it to your boss before each presentation. That gives him the ammunition he needs to support you to higher managers. 

Why on earth would they accept what you say without questioning? Having seen both sides of this particular fence, I know that many times people have claimed technical difficulties to avoid work they did not want to do. They have claimed limitations of the tool when the real reason was incompetence or a bug they would prefer to hide. Further, managers have responsibilities too. They a have a fiduciary responsibility to deliver the project at least cost. They are rewarded or punished for on-time completion. They are expected to explain any deadlines that are not met or features that are not implemented, often to people outside the organization such as the clients paying the bills. These meetings can get quite antagonistic as the people who are paying for the work are often unhappy when it is not going to meet their business deadline. They have to be able to soothe the people who are ultimately paying for the project and they must be able to explain in enough detail that they don't look like an idiot to the client. And clients sometimes have technical people representing them at these meetings. So of he goes in and tells them that such and such can't be done and the tech guy doesn't believe that, he is going to be closely cross-examined. So how do you know what to tell them when they ask? This is fairly individualized and it is something that is best asked of the manager who is asking for information. Just this week for instance I have basically told one manager that we messed up and broke something, it was complicated to fix and even more complicated to QA and on a different problem with a different project manager and sales team, I had to give all the gory details of exactly what the problem was, why it was a problem and how we needed to mitigate the problem for the client until the ultimate fix was put into place. My default when I don't know the person well is to err on the side of too much information and let them tell me what they didn't need. Being able to speak knowledgeably and off the cuff on detailed technical issues tends to give you credibility even when the person doesn't understand exactly what you are saying. If I feel it necessary, I can even point to some documentation of the problem. I also then tend to turn my explanation around to what this all actually means from a business perspective and how it impacts them. So now the person who doesn't know me well can tell that I understand their business needs as well as being clearly technically knowledgeable. By doing this early in a business relationship, you can get to the point where they trust you when you say, 'We messed up and broke something, it was complicated to fix and even more complicated to QA.' The one thing you don't want to do is appear to be avoiding answering their questions or hiding something. That only leads to much more detailed questioning. This is especially true if you give them the impression that you are annoyed at them for daring to question you. You have to think of senior managers sort of like IRS auditors. Yes it is annoying, but they have the right to the information and they need it to do their own jobs, so you have to put up with it as graciously as you can. 

I have to add a bit of a female perspective to this. If the co-worker who brings in the child is the mother, be aware that any jokes about how this will mean she is less able to do her job will not be funny or appreciated. A new mother is probably already a bit worried about how to handle all these responsibilities and making her feel as if her co-workers think she is less professional for having a baby is going to stress her further. If you happen to be someone who is trying to get pregnant and cannot, it is acceptable to avoid the baby as much as possible. If your co-worker who has the baby knows the situation, he or she is likely to understand. If not, you might consider telling that person (especially if it is your boss) privately so he or she understands why you avoided the baby. It is probably better if you can bring yourself to be happy for them and compliment the baby, but when something is hurtful already it may not be possible, so go easy on yourself. If you don't want to tell people about your fertility issues, then you are going to be expected to act like anyone else, so brush up on your acting skills, compliment the baby and then go to the ladies room and cry. 

If you are too ill to work at a programming job, you are too ill to be doing personal programming projects. So just stop it. If your employer found out you were doing this, they would rightly want to know why you can't return to work. Likely this attempting to work on the computer is delaying your own recovery. So stop it. Next, you have approved medical leave, don't let the project manager push you to work when you are not ready physically. You could seriously damage your health that way. Call HR and ask them to explain to your boss why you are not returning to work and why he should not be pressuring you to return before you are healthy. Your boss is creating a legal liability for your company by pressuring you. If you returned to work and then had a relapse because you were not strong enough to work, it would be the company's legal responsibility for pressuring you. It is not your responsibility to save the team by going back prematurely. Next, the PM is not going to have a choice about how you will need to return to work. If you need to work from home or work part time, that is what he will legally have to do for you if that is what the doctor tells you that you need to do. Get with your HR on a return to work plan after consulting with your doctor. The PM will have to do whatever they say he has to do. Personally from what you described, it sounds like looking into returning part time woudl be best for you. And it doesn't sound as if you even considered that as a possibility. And if you return part-time, DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, work on those personal programming projects until you are completely back to work full-time. 

This is tough situation. A lot of what you can do will depend on his attitude. First talk to the managers who moved him under you and find out clearly what they feel he did wrong and what they expect you do to do with him. You need a defined road map to success. Next talk to him about what went wrong from his perspective. See how far what the managers think needs to change is from what he thinks is the problem. Likely there will be a significant gap. It is up to you to help him understand that what the senior management want is relevant even if he doesn't agree with it. But in the first conversation just find out what he thinks went wrong and why. Try to get a feel for his attitude about being placed under you. Now after you know both sides, you need to come up with a plan. List what he needs to get from working for you and then figure out what tasks he needs to be given to get the kind of experience and knowledge he needs. Depending on how large a gap there is, you may want to start with him observing you and then with him being assigned to do the task. You may need to ask him to provide you with his plans before he tries to implement them so that you can critique. When you present the plan, point out to him that management would have fired him, if they didn't think he could learn to be a good manager. Let him know that you want to help him succeed because your own success depends on it as well. But also let him know that if he doesn't try to improve you will be willing to let him go through whatever process you have available (check with HR in advance to know exactly what you have to do to fire someone for poor performance, it will vary from country to country and company to company) to let him go. Tell him you will be measuring progress along the way and discussing it with him. Unless his own viewpoint of what went wrong was totally unbelievable, at least try to address some of the problems he spoke of and how those will be prevented this time. Show him you have listened to him. Now even if you do all this and he responds well, you still have a problem. The other people who report to you are going to resent it if you spend all this time helping him succeed without spending a similar amount of time helping them succeed. They may well see him as an unwelcome competitor who will harm their own chances for promotion by taking the most interesting and challenging tasks away from them. So you need to talk to them about where they want to go and create a plan for them as well. This situation is a real balancing act. Document everything. If he is one of those people who is incapable of believing he has to change, then he won't try. You need to have the evidence of what you tried to do and how he responded. If he ends up being a liability for your team, then you need to be able to to take the steps to fire him. Make sure to work closely with your HR on this issue. They need to see the evidence that he is improving or not improving and what you have done to help him improve (remember your own evaluation depends on this). A lot of poor perfomers stay in their organizations because people don't like being the bad guy who does the firing. Your own organization may be trying to see if you do have the courage to get rid of him if he doen't shape up. Be careful, he could undermine the rest of your team very easily through his words or actions. This is a situation you have to monitor fairly closely. 

Saying no is a task necessary to learn for all professions. The key is to be polite but crystal clear that you are saying no. People try all the time to avoid outright saying no but then they wonder why the other person thinks they might mean yes. Remember it is kinder to say no clearly right awy than let someonthink it might really be yes. So what to say. In this case I would simply say: "That's sound's like it would be interesting but I cannot help out due to my workload at school." Don't get into a long involved explanation of why you don't have time. If you don't want to you dont need to give an expllanation at all. Don't say I can't help at this time because then he may want to know when would be a better time. If you do want to help but want to be paid. Then @WesleyLong's comment below should work just fine: 

I have found in general that when you want to switch careers, it is often best to get some experience in your current field that is similar to what you want to do. In your case, most people I know who have made the switch started out as tech leads, then moved to the first line supervisory positions. That will give you experience dealing with non-developers and people type issues. Then from there, many places have what is called a technical project manager who is expected to understand the technical details of devlopment more than a straight project manager. That is the next natural step. People who have been tech leads can also sometimes move to the BA positions once they show some talent at translating tech speak to user speak. BAs often move up to the PM positons. To make the switch is easiest at a company where you currently work. So if your company doesn't have the bureaucracy to have TPMs and PMs and tech leads, it is time to move to one that does. Things you should focus on as a tech lead to get noticed for higher positions include showing that you think of things from a business and not just a dev standpoint. You should be able to have your team deliver on time and on budget. You should be able to explain technical information to nontechnical people, you should be an active participant in meetings and you should get to know the people in the positions you are intertested in (and their supervisiors) so that they will recommend you for any vacancies. A tech guy who can speaker "user" is a pricelss commodity. If you show that ability, they will want to move you up. 

Well I for one would rather have a pay raise than a bonus "Scheme". Management might like this idea because in the long run it is way to pay you less (a pay raise is forever, a bonus is once). Bonuses also are not figured into your eventual retirement income, so you are giving up a lot of potential income through your whole life by wanting to convert to a bonus structure. But if you wanted to convince managment, that could be an effective argument - that they would only have to pay more for extreme success (and not everyone would get one) and not guarantee the money all along. If they go to this idea though, don't be surprised to see annual pay raises dissappear. One thing to be aware of is that it is far easier to get this into the budget for the next fiscal year, so time your request when they are starting to build the budget for next year.
