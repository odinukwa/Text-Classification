This is not quite what you are asking, but I addressed time optimality in my paper "Time-optimal control of finite quantum systems", J. Math. Phys. 41 (2000), 5262â€“5269. We have results like: if any control function reaches a desired target then there is one which does so in minimal time; a target is reached by a unique trajectory at time $t$ if it is an extreme point of the set of reachable targets at time $t$; any target reachable at time $t$ is reachable by a bang-bang control. The important qualifiers are that we work in the Born approximation, so the results are only valid over small times or energies, and we require the Hilbert space to be finite dimensional. 

Nope. Let $X$ be the set $\{0\} \cup \{\frac{1}{n}: n \in \mathbb{N}\} \subset \mathbb{R}$ together with one additional point $e$. The distance between two points neither of which is $e$ is just their usual distance in $\mathbb{R}$. Also set $d(e,e) = 0$, $d(e,0) = 2$, and $d(e,\frac{1}{n}) = 1$ for all $n$. This is a "b-metric" with $s = 2$ by inspection, and it is complete (any Cauchy sequence is either eventually constant or converges to $0$). But $\frac{1}{n} \to 0$ in the topology generated by $d$, while $d(e,\frac{1}{n}) \not\to d(e,0)$. 

Is there a simple, direct proof that the open coloring axiom contradicts CH (straight from the definitions, no machinery allowed)? The separable metric spaces version of OCA, if that helps. Edit: probably it wasn't clear what I was asking. Let's say, hypothetically, that I'm writing a book on forcing that is meant to be as elementary and readable as possible. I've just introduced OCA and I have half a page to show the reader that it contradicts CH. Can I do this without quoting external theorems? 

I think the best way to answer this question is to direct you to an introductory textbook on the mathematics of quantum mechanics. One book I really like is Hilbert Space Operators in Quantum Physics by Blank, Exner, and Havlicek. It sounds like the issue you are dealing with is that the canonical commutation relations can't be satisfied by bounded operators. You need to go to unbounded self-adjoint operators, which means they are only defined on a dense subspace of the Hilbert space. That's just the nature of the beast. In the C*-algebra approach we focus attention on C*-algebras of bounded operators to which the unbounded observables are affiliated. Maybe part of your question is that if $P$ and $Q$ are only densely defined then $e^{itQ}$ and $e^{isP}$ can only be densely defined too? No, when you exponentiate an unbounded self-adjoint operator you get a bounded, and everywhere-defined, unitary operator. An easy way to do this is to use spectral theory to turn your self-adjoint operator into a multiplication operator, say multiplication by a possibly unbounded real-valued function $f$ on $L^2(X,\mu)$, and then define the exponential of this multiplication operator to be multiplication by the bounded function $e^{itf}$. Again, you need to read a good introductory textbook to learn about this. 

I don't think so, if "compact manifold" means "compact manifold with boundary" (as it seems to from your example) and "diffeomorphic" means "with diffeomorphic interiors". My previous example wasn't right, as Willie Wong pointed out, because after gluing the result wasn't Riemannian. But we can fix that problem by a simple modification: let $M$ be the unit disk minus the region $y > \sqrt{|x|}$, and let $f$ be the map that zips up the slit. That works, doesn't it? 

The answer to the first question is yes. If $f$ has roots $\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n$ and $g$ has roots $\beta_1, \ldots, \beta_n$, then $f$ and $g$ have a common interlacing if and only if for all $1 \leq i < n$ the intervals $[\alpha_i, \alpha_{i+1}]$ and $[\beta_i, \beta_{i+1}]$ intersect. But if this is true for any pair of polynomials in some family, then for each $i$ the intervals from the $i$th to the $(i+1)$st roots must all have a common intersection, by the trivial 1-dimensional case of Helly's theorem. So there is a common interlacing. 

Let $G$ and $H$ be graphs on the vertex set $\{1, \ldots, n\}$ and let $(e_i)$ be the standard basis of $\mathbb{R}^n$. For each edge $\{i,j\}$ define edge vectors $e_i - e_j$ and $e_j - e_i$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$. 

Anyone feeling they have lost their motivation might take a look at Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! In the chapter where he starts teaching at Cornell, just after the war, he talks about feeling burned out and incapable of producing anything valuable. His solution was to adopt an attitude of not caring about the value of his work and just approach it as something to have fun with (and this worked out pretty well for him). There is also this quote from Stephen Hawking that I have found personally inspiring: 

If you want $\tilde{\varphi}$ to be normal then this is false. But first let me point out that there is a sense in which the GNS construction is a functor. Note that $\varphi$ induces an isometric embedding of $H_{f\circ\varphi}$ into $H_f$ (the respective GNS Hilbert spaces). So define a morphism between two representations $\pi: A \to B(H)$ and $\rho: B \to B(K)$ to be a $*$-homomorphism $\varphi: A \to B$ together with an isometric embedding $V: H \to K$ such that $\pi = V^*(\rho\circ\varphi)V$. Then the GNS construction is functorial. Here is a counterexample to the hypothesis you give, assuming normality of $\tilde{\varphi}$. Let $A$ be the continuous functions on $[0,2]$ which are constant on $[1,2]$, acting by multiplication on $L^2[0,2]$. Let $B = B(L^2([0,2]))$. Let $\varphi: A \to B$ be the inclusion and let $f$ be the vector state given by the unit vector $1_{[0,1]}$. Then $H_{f\circ\varphi} = L^2[0,1]$ and $\pi_{f\circ\varphi}$ is the restriction of the given representation to $H_{f\circ\phi}$, whereas $H_f = L^2[0,2]$ and $\pi_f$ is the identity representation of $B$. So $\tilde{A} = L^\infty[0,1]$ and $\tilde{B} = B$, and if there were a normal homomorphism $\tilde{\varphi}$ of the desired type then it would restrict to $\varphi$ on $A$. But the functions $f_n(t) = \begin{cases}\cos(2\pi nt)&0 \leq t \leq 1\cr 1&1 \leq t \leq 2\end{cases}$ in $A$ converge weak* to $0$ in $\tilde{A}$ but they converge weak* to $1_{[1,2]}$ in $\tilde{B}$, contradicting normality of $\tilde{\varphi}$. 

What about this. Consider the set $S$ of all diagonal matrices ${\rm diag}(c_n)$ with the properties (1) $c_0 = 1$, (2) $0 \leq c_n \leq 1$ for all $n$ and (3) $c_n$ decreases to $0$ as $n \to \infty$. Order $S$ by setting ${\rm diag}(c_n) \preceq {\rm diag}(d_n)$ if $c_{n+1} - c_n \geq d_{n+1} - d_n$ for all $n$. So as we move up the partial order, the diagonal entries decrease more slowly. It seems to me that Arveson's theorem about every operator being approximated by something like block diagonal operators (from his Duke Math J. paper) would imply that the commutator with any operator would go to zero. 

If I'm reading it correctly, "countably decomposable" means that there is no uncountable family of mutually orthogonal nonzero projections. Such von Neumann algebras are now called "$\sigma$-finite". 

Having a subset of a set is "the same" as having a function from that set into $\{0,1\}$ (namely, the function which is $1$ on the subset and $0$ on its complement). If I have a function $f: X \to Y$ I can compose it with functions from $Y$ to $\{0,1\}$ and thereby turn subsets of $Y$ into subsets of $X$. I guess that's one explanation for why pre is natural in a way that post is not. 

Edit: we cannot find such an example. It would imply a negative solution to the KS${}_2$ conjecture which has now been proven by Marcus, Spielman, and Srivastava in this paper. In fact, their solution implies that there always exists $S$ such that any $f$ supported on $S$ (or $S^c$) satisfies $\|\frac{1}{2}\hat{f} - \hat{f}|_T\|_2 \leq O(\sqrt{\epsilon})\cdot\|\hat{f}\|_2$. 

Editing to note that I've posted a paper using this result on the arXiv. Those 200 points were well spent! 

You ask for a hint. Here is what I would try. Given any two nests $N_1$ and $N_2$, for each finite subsets $A \subseteq N_1$ and $B \subseteq N_2$ find a norm one operator in $Alg(A) \cap Alg(B)$. Then take a WOT cluster point. That is guaranteed to give you an operator in $Alg(N_1) \cap Alg(N_2)$. The interesting part is ensuring that it isn't a scalar; to do that you'll have to think about what kind of control you have over the operator in $Alg(A) \cap Alg(B)$. Most likely you either have sufficient control to easily ensure the limit operator isn't a scalar, or have so little control that you can see how to rig things so that the limit operator has to be a scalar, either of which would provide an answer. 

No, that's false. You didn't say that $f$ is a homomorphism, but the answer is still no if we require this. Let $G = {\bf Z} \times C_2 \times C_3 \times C_5 \times \cdots$ be the product of the infinite cyclic group and the cyclic groups of all prime orders. Let $H = C_2 \times C_3 \times C_5 \times \cdots$ and let $f: G \to H$ be the obvious homomorphism with kernel ${\bf Z}$. Let $Y$ be the subgroup of $G$ generated by the element $(1, 1, 1, \ldots)$. It is a discrete infinite cyclic subgroup, but its image in $H$ is not discrete (in fact, it is dense in $H$). 

This seems like more of a philosophy of math question than a proper math question. However, in the past Mathoverflow has often been tolerant of such questions. The basic concern is that the universe of all things there are surely cannot itself be a separate thing. Various responses have been given. On the iterative conception of sets, as it is usually expressed, there is no "completed" $V$, but rather an unending series of stages which are built up iteratively in a process which can never be completed. The obvious objection is that an abstract platonic object is not something which can be "built", nor can it appear in "stages" if it is timeless. One may then be told that the language about building in stages is merely metaphorical, which is not so satisfying. Russell considered $V$ to be "self-reproductive" in the sense that "we can never collect all of the terms having the said property into a whole, because, whenever we hope we have them all, the collection which we have immediately proceeds to generate a new term also having the said property". Of course the language about collecting into a whole and generation are still dubious, but Dummett reformulated the idea in terms of "indefinitely extensible" concepts where it is one's conception of $V$, not $V$ itself, which keeps changing. However, if you look at it carefully you discover that in order to make sense of the idea of indefinite extensibility you already have to understand the difference between sets and proper classes, which is what the idea was supposed to explain. I don't think there are settled answers to these questions. Joel Hamkins' work on the "set-theoretic multiverse" is a provocative recent approach which might appeal to you. My view on these matters is given in the last chapter of my book Truth & Assertibility --- in brief, my position is that there is a well-defined class of all sets, but there is no class of all classes because classes cannot be explicitly listed out, as sets (in principle) can. In other words, classes can only be presented indirectly by linguistic expressions, which creates the possibility of there being expressions whose status as representing a class cannot be decided. This means that reasoning about proper classes demands the use of intuitionistic logic and renders the concept "class of all classes" illegitimate. This view is worked out in detail in my book mentioned above. 

No, of course not. Even if $A$ is bounded, this would imply that $i_\omega A$ is self-adjoint. So you only have a chance if $A$ and $i_\omega$ commute.
