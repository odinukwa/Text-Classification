Looking very quickly, it seems like a frail code. Still, it works as expected. But I saw a few things to improve: 

It accepts anything that can be converted into a string, and expects the length of the substring to be found. The length must be withing a certain range and must be a valid number. It will be converted into a 32-bit signed integer later on. This will be part of a larger project, and just want to make sure it is as polished as it can be. 

Now you ask: Why? And the answer is because of shortcut evaluation. If is , it won't evaluate , because we know that it will be false as well. This won't save much, but you shave some comparisons. Which is really good! 

It is a pretty straightforward CSS, without many complications. But, remember that it suffered a rewrite. Replace your CSS with this: 

With the replacement as an empty string, you would remove the double-space in . Normalizing it to a single space will return instead of minifying into . 

I would move lot more closer to the area where it's modified, so it can be easily seen with eye, where the whole block is, and span over fewer branching points (which is always error prone, to keep correct stack across some branching). You can actually surround just few instructions with , not having any branching at all. 

Peter Cordes did leave you several review comments in the original SO question, so I will post the code-only here which is sort of adjusted by his advices (and my small modifications). Commands to compile: 

performance ideas (from comment): If you are already assuming ASCII alphabet-only word inputs, you may do direct , which will yield only values, and for vs it will produce the same values too (functioning as fake ). I also personally prefer non-else/non-nested variants (when they make sense), so I would do and the would go after that in the loop block. This is part of answer is level golfing advice, i.e. lowering readability and robustness of source for some hypothetical performance gain, not suitable for real world production code ;). 

There aren't many things wrong. And the code itself is surprisingly short. But this will be a really long review. The first thing that bothers me is that you talk about JSON, but you show an object. That's fine, but you should show how you decode the JSON into that object. But, within the scope of this review, I'll refer to it as an object, which is what was presented. Not to mention that all the links point to s. Now, lets tackle the code! Javascript: The indentation of that object is really off. Not to mention that you have mixed quote styles. 

Adding on Flambino's answer, I just have to say that your code breaks on IE9. Since you didn't specify which browsers you want to support and which versions, I will assume you want to support all modern browsers plus IE8. According to the MDN page about , this method is only supported on IE10+. Currently, Windows Vista SP2 is supported (until 11th April), which only supports IE9. IE9 can still be installed on Windows 7, and may be the default browser for some. Also, devices with Android 2.1 will throw errors, since this isn't supported. 

This will not compile, you should rather provide working source for review. By building it yourself before posting you will prevent some kind of accident, like cutting out more than you did want. Also I have no idea what is or , so no way to review it and put any advice on that. Except stop using cryptic short symbol names which can't be comprehended by reading like plain English. 

I found another bug in your source: will be always false. Unrelated to your bug, I have read an advice somewhere to always use only "<", "<=", "==" and "!=" in comparisons. It felt strange for few weeks, but once you get used to it, it really makes easier to read sources, as you know the values should only increase from left to right, if the expression is true. So I would write your expression as: . 

Why does the function end when is not equal to ? That should be mentioned in description, that must be to make it work. 

edit: When designing the algorithm, design also "memory". Where the data are stored, how much of them, why (purpose), when you want to create (temporary) copy, or when you want to use semantics, etc. I'm not suggesting to go after full "Data-Oriented Design" (unless you are designing some big-data processing application, where performance is main goal), but still some level of awareness how your data are flowing under the hood is good to have. Often by keeping data life cycle lean and without useless moving around, you will not only gain performance, but also simpler algorithm implementation and less code written = less bugs. 

But not everything is bad. You heard me about bad naming and missing whitespace. But now you have a new problem: too much whitespace! Look at this: 

The code is hard to read, in my opinion. You have stuff everywhere: Same line, next line, mixed up... Now, let's review the code: 

This should do it for you. It throws an if the imge is invalid or if it can't write to the location. 

As the title says, this batch script installs the XignCode Bypasser. Xigncode is a software bundled with games to analise running programs and prevent cheating. (Sometimes, it prevents the game to load at all on the newest Windows releases.) For this, a bypasser was created that disables this check, allowing players to run the game (if they couldn't), mod the game (One Click Tool, for example) and (if you want) cheat. Copying the files manually is a boring task that can lead to mistakes (copying from the wrong location, deleting the Bypasser by mistake, ....). For that, I've made the following batch script that does all the copying and extraction: 

(the exact value stored in is , encoded as 64 bit integer value) So you are just destroying precision bits of the original value, but the resulting value can still contain decimals with precision you don't expect. For some more information study how the floating point numbers are designed, maybe this may be of help: $URL$ 

View: I prefer to couple my views tightly with models, so the init/update methods take reference to actual model class (ie. View has to import Model). It's not storing the model reference, only using it's API to init/update it's current state and forgetting about it, so you can any time change the View to display current state of different instance of model. With the above model, and intent to have special effect for "level up" event, I would probably design API as: 

Hmm... ok, one bit of source just to make it look a bit less like "wall of text" (although I'm afraid it's too late for that :D ). 

Example implementation of those ideas in this post and comments: ped.7gods.org/WordLadder.zip Meanwhile, lured by the fun of figuring out algorithm, and writing the code, I completely went off the path of reviewing your code instead. Sorry Jonathan. And to make it even worse, my source is not as clean as to be proper example in every possible way, but I have it now for few days sitting on disc and can't get to cleaning it up more, so I'm releasing it at least for the sake of algorithm example, as is. 

The first thing I saw when I looked at your code was the obvious disregard to any kind of indentation! It is nearly unreadable! There's no excuse to have a code without any indentation. Throwing the code into any PHP online formatter should suffice. 

Notice something? The use of jQuery just to retrieve the value of an . Just remove the jQuery from there! has the same effect at a WAY HIGHER speed, without ANY bloat. You have it right a few lines below, and I give you credit for that. 

The characters , and will have a special meaning. They have to be replaced with their URL-codes. works on URL-encoded strings and leaving those characters unchanged would cause all sorts of bugs. The order of the elements in the array is VERY important. Here's how it works: 

I decided to stop there. You don't validate if is a number. What would happen if I run ? And ? It continues executing, without any validation what-so-ever. I expect it to throw an exception or or something. 

Usually when you can UnitTest all model API easily in pure JUnit (without mocking JApplet environment or providing fake UI/display), you are on the right track. There's sometimes need to provide some complex back-end functionality, like database, or server API, for model classes, but it should be still quite easy to mock only a bit of it, and having model exercised to do everything it should. Testing View classes is quite often much more difficult, or straight counter-productive, if you change the design a lot, so your tests would have to be updated often. Testing Controller code depends, usually needs some good instrumentation helper to simulate all kind of inputs/events, mock views (just verifying the is called at proper places), and often may work upon real model classes, making such tests more integration than unit. Why I'm talking about tests so much, while you didn't even ask. Because once you do the MVC properly, unit testing "model" part becomes so easy, that it's low hanging fruit and should be probably your next topic to try out, after you get more comfortable with MVC patterns. :) 

Created a few variables at the top, with needed information. Created a loop to go through all the elements Reduced the number of local variable to the bare minimum Removed global variables being declared inside the function 

Still, there is no validation of the data. And there's no way to pick 0.5â‚¬ (50 cents). You should look into that. 

This is nowhere perfect, but it is better than storing it in plain text. This is just a tad better than nothing. Still, it isn't safe. 

This will have the exact structure you wish. Simply use to access all values. And done! An alternative with 0 lines of code! 

Why do you have a at the end? As soon as the script finishes, it will just exit. No need to have the there. 

But I'm still not happy. The regex don't need the around every word. Or at all. Basically, you could write both as this: 

Shows that it still takes 4-5 milliseconds, on Google Chrome (on my pc), while @Kruga's ES6 answer is a lot faster (0.9-2 milliseconds). Here are some improvements I've made, without any regards to keep the programming style integrity: 

I was thinking whether searching for neighbours for new word can be optimized by searching only trough "neighbours of neighbours of first-found-neighbour", but after short tinkering with it I think this is not valid, this would maybe work for all 4-letter permutations forming complete graph, not for regular words when plenty of possible 4 letter permutations are not available. 

I also modified the code to be PIC (position independent code). This is first time ever I tried that with assembly, so I'm not 100% sure I did+linked it correctly, but the code works, in debugger I see relative addressing, and stripped binary has only about 6kiB, so looks OK to me ... and now I tried to run it multiple times in debugger, and the code address is randomized, so the ASLR works too. And fixed some of your comments. And I test return value, so now the code upon invalid input will simply output the current sum, and the program can be terminated early by entering non-integer, or Ctrl+D. 

Another edit: Couldn't resist from showing off, how the function can be further cleaned up for better performance (unrolling the loop for special case, getting rid of in loop). The real world benefit is of course useless, as the loop is done only N-times (vs permuting N size array inside, which is much more complex). So just for your fun ;). (BTW, OCD is evil thing, even partial ... hard to dismiss some things from head)
