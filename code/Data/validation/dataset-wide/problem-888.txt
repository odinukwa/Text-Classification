To be considered an element, they would have to have a positively charged nucleus. They don't. The neutron star is largely neutral. They would have to have a cloud of surrounding electrons. These electrons would have to share "orbitals" with other electrons around other, nearby neutron stars. That doesn't happen. Finally, at these scales, gravitational interaction predominates. Even if neutron stars did have some positive charge, and did have electrons orbiting them, interaction with other neutron stars would still depend a lot on gravity. Finally, even if a neutron star was charged, it's not clear whether electrons around them would actually fall into some kind of orbitals governed by quantum mechanics. QM tends to not happen at such a scale. In conclusion, no, they are completely unlike atoms and their nuclei. 

Yes, the vast majority of small telescopes made for visual observations (like most dobsonians and other newtonian-based architectures) have very limited back focus. In other words, with the focuser retracted all the way in, the focal plane of the primary mirror is sticking out only a short distance. A large back focus is not typically seen, nor is it desirable, in a visual scope. (However, most astrographs have a large back focus.) This is compounded by the fact that most DSLR have a flange distance (focus-flange distance) which is pretty large - over 45...50 mm in many cases. Furthermore, an additional distance is wasted by the classic T-ring adapters, which tend to push the camera way back from the focuser's shoulder. All these factors conspire in your case to prevent you from achieving focus. 

The universe is mostly black because there's not enough regular matter (stars, more specifically) in the observable universe to light it up fully. It's just a whole lot of empty space - hence dark. It is true that in the outer parts of the observable universe objects are so red shifted that it's hard to see them anymore. That's one thing. The other thing is - once objects are so far that they are moving away from us faster than light speed, it is 100% impossible for us to see them, forever. They are completely outside the observable universe. So, the night sky is dark because the observable universe is not infinite, and because it's mostly empty. This is the solution to Olbers' paradox. 

If the image in the center is fairly good, but you get "coma like" effects at the edge, then that is indeed coma (perhaps mixed with other aberrations). It is normal at focal ratios of f/5 ... f/4 or faster. If the focal ratio is around f/6 ... f/8 or slower, coma is not so easily visible, or not visible at all. 

You could also observe the Sun. Get a white light filter, the kind that fits on the top of your telescope, covering the whole aperture. Filters made from the Baader Solar Film are best, they are very good performers and tend to be cheap. Either buy the Baader foil and make the filter yourself, or purchase a complete filter. $URL$ $URL$ Just make sure the size of the filter fits the diameter of the OTA (the main tube) of your telescope - NOT the aperture size, but the external diameter of the OTA. This will allow you to see sunspots. You can also observe the transit of Mercury over the solar disk, which happens once every several years. I think the next one is in 2019. You can also observe solar eclipses this way. If you need to use the finderscope when observing the Sun, then make a small filter for it, too. I made some cute little solar filters for my finderscopes from Baader film and white plastic tubes used for sprinkler systems. Cheap, but effective. $URL$ Obviously, never point the scope at the Sun without the full aperture filter. And make sure the filter doesn't fall off. Or else all sorts of mayhem may ensue, up to and including someone losing an eye, or the house burns down, etc. Not kidding. Unfiltered, the solar energy coming out of the scope is like a plasma torch. 

The ideal shape for the mirror is round. It's the easiest to make. It's the best-behaved while in use. The hex tiles are already harder. The mirror is a revolution surface generated by a conic curve (circle, parabola, hyperbola, ellipse), which needs to be machined with a precision greater than 0.1 microns. That's extremely difficult already with a round mirror, where the surface can be easily distorted near the edge in the process of manufacturing. With the hex tiles, maintaining that precision near the corners is very hard - corners are like the edge but exponentially harder. Unless you take special precautions and unless you perform extra work, you're guaranteed to end up with surface errors near the corners (the surface is either too raised, or too low, or has a more complex distortion). Based on my experience making round mirrors, I would guess the surface near the corners would tend to be turned down (too low relative to the rest), which is a defect that's extremely hard to correct - one of the hardest, in fact. With a pie slice, all problems mentioned above increase greatly in magnitude. The blunt angle of the hex tile gives you some support in machining the surface, but the sharp angle of the pie slice gives you almost none. I can't even begin to imagine the difficulties one would encounter while making a high precision surface on a pie slice. The sharp end of the slice would be almost guaranteed to be worse quality than the rest. 

The magnetic field of a star is not entirely a result of the global spin of the star. The global spin is part of it, but there are other mechanisms as well. Within the star, there are convection zones, meridional flow, etc. $URL$ All these flows generate their own field components. The overall field is simply the sum of all little fields. Its general orientation might be close to the global spin, if the strongest components are aligned to it, but there are many smaller components with different orientations. Therefore, the total field of the star can be somewhat slanted. And then the star collapses into a neutron star, and its field is compressed. The collapse itself may be slightly asymmetrical, and may further deviate the magnetic field axis. As a result of all of the above, it's by no means unusual that the magnetic field of the neutron star is not aligned with the spin. 

Significant external factors can distort the shape of the event horizon. Two black holes merging will go through a process where spherical symmetry is lost temporarily: $URL$ Technically, anything near a BH would slightly distort the metric of spacetime, but in practice this would not be easily measurable unless the external factor is very large (another very massive object). So for most practical purposes, the metrics described above would apply. 

Please be aware that anything that gets out of our observable universe, be it regular matter, dark matter, or dark energy, is lost to us forever. The event horizon (outer limit) of the observable universe does not apply only to regular matter, it applies to everything. That being said, within the observable universe, we don't really know if the relative percentages of regular matter, dark matter, and dark energy are changing a whole lot. 

Here's an analogy. I know that this universe is 3D. But imagine for a moment that it's 2D instead. Imagine it's like an infinite sheet of paper, stretching out forever, but only in 2 dimensions. Now, a hand's width above that infinite sheet of paper place another infinite sheet. And a little higher another one. And so on. All these sheets of paper are infinite, yet they can coexist just fine. The trick is - they all exist in a 3D space. Similarly, you could have an infinity of 3D universes all coexisting in a higher dimensional multiverse. WARNING: This is not a "theory". It is just a hypothesis. We have no proof that the multiverse exists. Some scientists have hypothesized that this is the case because it would help explain certain features of this universe. But so far there is no proof. This is normal and it's how science works. This is not idle dreaming. Scientists encounter some strange phenomena. They put forth a hypothesis. Other scientists look for proof. If proof is not found, the hypothesis is scrapped. If proof is found, then it becomes a proper theory. The multiverse idea is currently in that stage before proof; we don't know yet how things will turn out. That is all. 

Sometimes you find super-cheap eyepieces there, too, like this one: $URL$ Also keep digging around that site, maybe you'll find various other parts necessary for building the refractor. Enormous care must be given to keeping the objective and the eyepiece collimated (aligned and centered). Even a tiny collimation error will greatly affect performance. This is not a trivial engineering problem. 

Planets do scintillate, just much less often - it takes much greater turbulence to make them twinkle. I've seen Venus twinkle quite a few times, especially when it was close to horizon. Light pollution makes no difference when observing the planets in the Solar System. They are far too bright to be affected by it. Saturn should be an off-white when observed with the naked eye. That being said however, if the planet is close to horizon and atmosphere is turbulent, it can cause some weird color effects. But then the color would appear to change rapidly. In any case, as someone else said in comments, no planet looks like a "ball" to the naked eye. They are all points of light just like the stars. Check this guide, it should tell you the best method to locate Saturn these days (use the image at the top of the article): $URL$ If the object you're looking at is in the right place with regard to Antares and the other things in Scorpio, then it's probably Saturn, no matter what color it seems to be. Color is very subjective and can be modified by the atmosphere in some cases. Position is not subjective. Don't worry too much about color. For comparison, Jupiter is a more pronounced shade of butter-yellow than Saturn, so that's less controversial, you don't see people argue about the color of Jupiter. But a lot of people see Saturn as plain white; I see it as off-white, the color of old PC cases. If you can borrow some good binoculars, you should see the ring. Lean the instrument (or your elbows) against something solid (like a table or wall), try and keep the binoculars very steady, and watch the object. Be patient and hold steady. You should see the ring as a tiny streak across the planet, kind of like the letter phi: Φ. Just regular binoculars should be enough to make this observation, and it's pretty awesome when you see it for the first time. In a bigger instrument the real shape of the ring becomes evident.
