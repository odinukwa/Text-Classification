They were not educated in the modern sense. They were not taught to read or write or philosophy. To become a Knight was a long and demanding task all by itself. It required years of training but that training was more practical. It was about horsemanship, archery, using a lance, a sword, a mace. How to take care of armor. How to walk, ride and fight in armor. Knighthoods were not bestowed. A young person, typically of nobel birth, would have started as a page, and then progressed as a squire. Young persons left their homes at early ages and entered into the service of great lords who could afford to train them. They would spend their lives in the service of their liege lord. So they had trained for years, even decades to learn what they needed to know to become knights and reading and writing were not among the requisite skills. 

Rome vs Macedonia I don't think the Macedonians had grown soft due to all the booty sent back by Alexander is a reasonable answer. The timeline doesn't support that, nor do the events which lead to the fall of Macedonia. Namely 4 separate Wars with Rome spanning five decades, 5 wars if you count the Seleucid War. Macedonia actually came away with a draw in the first war. All this happened 130 years after Alexander died and ended about 200 years after Alexander. 

It would have taken a lot more than Caltrops to save the Byzantine Empire. The Byzantine Empire fell to the Ottomans in 1453 when Europe was just entering the Renaissance, 1000 years after the Western Empire fell. When it fell it was just the capitol of Constantinople that was sacked. That was the culmination of 700 years of loosing ground to Islamic armies. During the rule of the Byzantium Emperor Justinian (527AD-565AD) the Byzantine Empire included most of the land surrounding the Mediterranean Sea including North Africa. By 700AD Byzantine had lost the entire middle east and North Africa. By 1373 Byzantium was economically shattered and relegated as a vassal to the Turks. When the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II sacked Constantinople the once vast empire was little more than a city state and the Byzantium Empire had been at war with the Muslims for 700 years.. (634 AD - 1458). At the end their population was exhausted, their wealth was spent, their economy was shattered and perhaps worst of all they were mostly alienated from Western Europe who had come to their aid in the previous centuries. A few competent rulers in a row would have helped them more than caltrops, maybe just a few competent diplomats. Source:

Iran had tried to hit the site itself prior to Israel but were unsuccessful. This was the first of ongoing discussions leading up to the attack. source: wikipedia 

Yes, when you hear about the Underground Railroad being a dangerous path to freedom, all of that danger was in the North. The Underground Railroad did not exist in the south. It only existed in the north to help slaves after they reached the north. Only a small number of people in the north helped escaped slaves and with the exception of short periods escaped slaves could still be captured and sent south even from the northern states. Most of those associated with the underground railway were free blacks or escaped slaves. The famous conductor Harriet Tubman was an escaped slave. Myths of the Underground Railroad Typically, For much of the time of slavery in the United States, there were shades of freedom for escaped slaves in the North. The Fugitive Slave Act of 1793, guaranteed a right of a slaveholders to recover an escaped slave even in the North. Sometimes State Laws in Free States still enforced slavery: In 1804, Ohio passed a law prohibiting runaway slaves from entering the state. It wasn't until 1840 that Ohio had the concept of slaves entering their state would become free, and only then based upon how long they stayed. It was not immediate. In 1850 as part of a larger compromise the federal government would take away enforcement of slave laws from the states. In 1850 as part of the Missouri Compromise the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 required the return of fugitive slaves even if they reached Northern Free States. Any black--even free blacks--could be sent south solely on the affidavit of anyone claiming to be his or her owner. . This effectively meant that no state in the Union was a free state, because any local authorities could be coerced into sending any African American, free or slave south on the flimsiest of justifications. Also Slave holders were legally able to bring their slaves north when they traveled without fear of an escape supported by local authorities. This was a big factor in the North's radicalization and ultimate creation and support for the Abolitionist Republican Party in the elections of 1856 and 1860. Northerners who did not assist escaped slaves when Slavery was mostly prevalent in the South, Now were opposing it because they legally had no recourse but to accept it. It was as much a reaction against the South. Northern Reaction to the Fugitive Slave Laws. 

So even while the Governments didn't get along at times, the people did even when tensions where high. This fostered and fueled a strong economy relationship which transcended government policy. WWI is a demonstration of this transcending economic relationship and explains the US siding with the British, as it was a consortium of US banks(2000) organized by J.P. Morgan; which first supported the British and France financially(*). Morgan had taken over his families investment Banking business (House of Morgan) in 1913 when his father died and now was in control of the bi continental banking empire. His banks branches were in New York, London, and Paris and he made multiple loans in the hundreds of millions of dollars scale to Britain and France. Likewise the US maintained Neutrality during the early stages of that war. The US Steel and Manufacturing, and agricultural industries were all up significantly supplying goods to Britain and France. The outstanding loans alone would make the US entry into WWI on the side of Germany unimaginable, and the US entry on the side of Britain a forgone conclusion when the war languished on and the Allies began to receive unsecured loans from US banks. (see business considerations) The US British relationship is today a governmental one. Britain is a five eye's ally of the United States which puts in on a special tier beyond other close allies. But historically the US/British relationship is based upon economics which start with the populations of both countries, and not the governments. (*) A Private Bank at War: J.P.

There is some conflicting depictions of the Persian (Achaemenid) Empire. History does not really record them as being blood thirsty savages as some modern Hollywood offerings do. They were militarily accomplished, they had a huge empire, and they invaded Greece which tend to support the depiction of savage, ruthless nemesis of the birth place of democracy. But they also ended the first diaspora (exile and slavery of the Jews) releasing Jews taken by the Asyrians from slavery to return home to the lands of Judea. The Achaemenid's paid for the great temple in Jerusalem to be rebuilt (destroyed when Judea fell to the Babylonian Nebuchadnezzar ). Achaemenid rulers appointed prophets who taught at the Temple on the Mount and wrote books which are still included in the old Testament. One of the Achaemenid Rulers (Cyrus) was such a great spirit he is the only gentile(non jew) to be referred too as Messiah in the Old Testament. He is represented in those pages as both speaking with and for God in the old testament, doing God's work on earth. Cyrus the Great also had multiple experiences where he took over rival kindoms in bloodless conflicts, (Babylon and Ecbatana) where so great was Cyrus's reputation in treatment of his captives and enemies, that when he showed up, the people opened their gates to him and welcomed his rule.
