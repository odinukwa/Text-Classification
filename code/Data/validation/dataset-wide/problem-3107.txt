I wouldn't call it "unique," but Hitler adopted the "Keynesian" prescription of "pump-priming" a depressed economy through government spending. Even if it was for military spending (which to Hitler, was a form of "investment.") This started in 1933-34, and pre-dated Keynes' 1936 tome, "A General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money." This gave Nazi Germany an economic "head start" of several years over the Allies: France, England, and America. 

Triglav, Slovenia, was a part of the former Yugoslavia. During World War I, it was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which fought against Italy (one of the "Allies"), among others. There was fighting around there in World War II as well, but by Yugoslav guerrillas that didn't have artillery. It was a critical point on the Italian and Austrian borders near where it intersects the borders with Switzerland. It was a mountainous area, that connected the plains containing Austria's Vienna and Italy's Venice. The mountains protected both of these key cities from the enemy, unless said enemy dominated the whole plateau. Essentially the whole of the Austro-Italian fighting took place in this general area, between 1915-1917. The Germans and Austrians got the better of the Italians at the battle of Capretto, threatening Venice, and nearly knocking Italy out of the war. The Italians hoped that it would be the other way, with an advance on Vienna. Mountain artillery is a special "breed." It has to be heavy enough to do the job, but light enough to carry up mountains, which is to say that it can be "disaasembled," and then reassembled at the top. Even so, carrying the pieces up mountains is no easy task. The guns on Triglav were likely 65 and 70 caliber Italian and Austrian artillery of World War I vintage. 

Japan had a disadvantage in heavy equipment, especially artillery and ships artillery. Many Japanese soldiers were killed in heavy bombardments. After the early battles (e.g. Guadalcanal), Japan seldom bombarded or bombed American soldiers. Artillery fire is the deadliest in combat, more so than "small arms" fire because it is heavier; deadlier than say, bombs, because it's closer to the ground. In some ways, the Japanese casualty rate was not that much higher than that of the Americans. If you take casualties as "killed and wounded," the Japanese to American casualty rate was less than 2 to 1, and sometimes as low as 1 to 1. What is true is that the Japanese ratio of killed was much higher. The reason was that essentially all Japanese casualties were "killed" while most American casualties were wounded. Okinawa is a case in point. Wikipedia lists American casualties (to the nearest thousand) as 20,000 dead, 55,000 wounded, 26,000 psychiatric, that is 75,000 physical casualties, 101,000 in all. Japanese casualties were estimated at 77,000-110,000 dead, 7,000 known be captured, approximating the American toll. One disadvantage the Japanese had was that they were trapped on Pacific islands. American "wounded" were usually evacuated and nursed back to health; Japanese wounded were wounded repeatedly until dead, or they killed themselves. Few surrendered (the 7,000 at Okinawa was "high" in this regard). 

As late as the 18th century, India had a cotton industry that was at least as advanced as the European textile industry. But when England conquered most of the country, she felt that it was too competitive with her woolens industry. So England taxed India's cotton industry and otherwise prevented it from developing. Same with a number of other industries in the country. Instead, under "mercantilism," India was made to produce raw, not finished goods. So colonization appears to be the culprit. 

Nearly all countries grew quickly in the 1950s and 1960s for pretty much the same reasons. That applies to the United States, Britain, Germany, Japan, most of the rest of Europe, major parts of Asia, certain (but not all) parts of Africa. World War II ravaged the industrial and production base of most of its participants (except those in North and South America), while killing a large number of people. At the same time, the "hot house" atmosphere of the war spurred a lot of technological innovation. So you had a large base of intellectual capital (numerator) applied to an artificially low base of physical capital and people (denominator). The combination of a large numerator and a small denominator made for a high growth rate. It was a great tragedy for those who were killed. But the survivors (and their Baby Boom children) did very well after the war. 

The rise of the U.S. to world power took place in several phases: 1) Settled a Continental sized area. During the course of the 19th century, occupied a continental-sized land area that was the fourth largest in the world. There were only three larger countries. Canada was slightly larger but much colder. Russia was MUCH larger but also much colder. China was slightly larger, but with a larger proportion of mountains and deserts. In terms of land mass, no other countries except Brazil and Australia (smaller populations) could approach the U.S. The U.S. has a larger population than today's Russia, and is exceeded only by China and India (the latter is much smaller in land area). 2) Also, in the 19th century, the U.S. rose to the most advanced level of development, which at the time, was in Europe. This gave it technological advantages over China, an Asian country, and Russia, a semi-Asian country. 3) European powers fought themselves to exhaustion in World War I and World War II. Because U.S. interests were threatened, the U.S. "had" to get involved, and was able to "pick up the pieces." 4) Basically, an equality of technology (with advanced European countries) plus a larger land mass and population caused the U.S. to take the leading world role. 5) If China and India can equalize with the U.S. in technology, their larger populations might enable one or both to surpass the U.S. in power. Smaller, but still viable challengers are Russia and Brazil. It is this fact that make them the "BRIC" nations. 

The Axis envisioned a world divided between a German dominated Europe, a Japanese dominated Asia, and the English speaking countries. America would be flanked on both sides by hostile groupings, each with comparable power, and initially be the "odd man out" in a three-cornered fight. Her main saving grace would be the possibility of choosing the lesser of two evils if and when the Germans and Japanese turned on each other. The Allies could not safely stop until Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan were deconstructed as such, and set upon the course of democracy enjoyed by most of the rest of the western world. That's why "unconditional surrender" was necessary. 

According to "Marching Orders", Enigma had a decisive impact on the (Second) Battle of El Alamein. Montgomery's first attacks were thrown back with heavy loss. Under different circumstances, he (or another commander) might have broken off the attack (as General US Grant did at Cold Harbor, in the Civil War). But Enigma alerted Montgomery to the fact that Rommel's losses were just as heavy in absolute terms, and twice as heavy in proportional terms (Montgomery outnumbered Rommel by at least two to one), and that Rommel was in "truly terrible shape." So Montgomery continued the assault and destroyed Rommel's army by attrition. Enigma played a part in later campaigns, in Italy, Normandy, etc., but never as decisively as at El Alamein. 

Norway shares the so-called "Scandinavian" peninsula with Sweden, and the two are contiguous. Therefore, the latter country was eager to make sure that it was in "friendly" hands. Apart from that, Sweden had an "eastern" (e.g. Baltic), facing strategy, unlike Denmark, which was more west-facing. As such, Iceland (and Greenland) to the west were not of particularly great interest to Sweden, but were of interest to Denmark. Norway could form an important part of Sweden's "east-facing" strategy, because the northern part goes to the Barents Sea, and from there, Archangel, Russia. Also to the (formerly) Finnish nickel mines in Petsamo.
