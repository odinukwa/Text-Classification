That entry corresponds with my ssh-key-based login event. SSH is listening to default port - 22. What is the role of logged port 51150 and does it mean I cannot use restrictive iptables settings that blocks all traffic incoming to ports other than ones that I have previously specified (like 20,21,25,80,443,143...) 

(obviously, we are speaking of publicly reachable server). Am I on the right trail - could rooted server be recognized by this approach and how? 

(Beware, , is critically important since it tells Postfix not to accept messages with recipients at domains that are not hosted locally. Without this line, your server would be an open relay.) 

Apache has built-in default limit of 8190 for LimitRequestLine Directive, which regulates maximum length of HTTP GET request. As mentioned, see if altering this parameter does your job. Regarding apache going down every hour or more often: I would be surprised that this is related to rejecting too long GET request. Apache is carefully crafted to drop irregular requests with minimum effort, precisely in order to avoid denial of service and resource exhaustion. From what you posted, this sounds like it may be related to type of Multi-Processing Modules (MPMs) you are using, relation of minimum/maximum forked processes and available system resources and of course, processing power your successful request are using on the back-end (PHP). 

It only took me an hour or so of Googling and trial n error to get a fully functioning ADITO solution running. Another couple hrs to write my own user modules. For 10 or so users, it's ideal. Free. 

Essentially, you want to run RDP over a VPN. So establish a vpn to the box by whatever means (hamachi/open vpn etc.) and then run an RDP client to connect to the box. For my purposes I use a web gateway to establish the vpn (Adito) and then run an RDP app that I have published inside the gateway. While powershell is an excellent tool for the Windows admin, it still needs a secure connection, and installing software strictly by means of Powershell (without the gui desktop) would be unnecessarily difficult. 

Rather than figuring out the perfect permissions, you could launch the update process using the "runas" utility 

You could set up a jet-direct and then packet-sniff the output to the printer. Personally, I'd copy all the fonts (.ttf or whatever) from the working machine to the misbehaving machine. Finally, check on your Wordpad settings. A lot of "general" printing output done in the Windows shell is by default routed through Wordpad. 

In order to use socket you need to specify: to also, you need to change settings in Postfix consequently: in add: 

Needless to say, you shouldn't hope for positive answer from any blacklist vendor unless you made sure that all standard conditions they may request from you are fulfilled: 

It is not problem at all if you send mail from main server / 11.11.11.111 that is not signed with DKIM , unless you have DMARC policy defined. All that is going to happen is emails not being signed with DKIM, which is not such big deal if SPF set correctly, which is not the case in your given example. SPF is almost completely useless if "hard fail" is not designated ( at the end of SPF TXT record entry). Hard fail tells receiving MTA's around the world that only designated hosts/ip are allowed to send emails for domain and no others (thus, hard fail - reject policy). In order to establish and maintain proper SPF, try to utilize online generators (example: SPF Wizard) , and of course, monitor results - send to tools that will confirm whether record is ok or not. 

If you have xp_cmdshell enabled it's pretty simple. Just use xp_cmdshell to launch the DOS "cluster" command. 

try using a fully qualified username: psexec \192.168.0.4 -u {targetmachinename}\Administrator -p adminPass ipconfig That'll tell the machine what context to use for that username. BTW, the "Administrator" account is enabled on that machine, right? Can you manually login using that account? 

Yes. You want option B, so that the OS is referencing 2 different disk files. One DB can be optimized for writing, the other for reading. Or you could accomplish the same in a single db, if you split your tables into separate filegroups/separate files. 

I'd do the whole thing inside Powershell. I wrote a script a while back to do some poor man's load balancing. It called some CLI code to return the state of a VM and acted accordingly. You'll do the same: Have the Powershell call a CLI statement (Using getstate) to get the state of your various guest VM's. If any of them are down, fire an SMTP email or use CLI to start the vm or whatever. Launch the Powershell by scheduled task on whatever interval you choose. Ought to work like a charm. 

After changing an IP address of email server (Postfix stack) I've found host that denies email message with: 

We know how to reject executables and other potentially dangerous file extensions via mime_header_checks directive: 

SPF and DKIM must not be seen as panacea for email deliverability problems. Period. Depending on many factors (vendor, software & others...), they may increase chances for good outcome, or decrease chances of messages being bounced at SMTP handshake level, provide sender integrity or cause email servers to bounce spammers pretending to come from your domain name, and that's it. It is also important to know that there are senders with long-established good reputation that don't use this two techniques at all (although not using SPF is really weird in 2017). I'd say your problem is well-known - Why Does hotmail still reject my emails? . With the details you have provided, I'd suspect that content of messages does have some significance to antispam software they are using - maybe try to alter content and see the results. 

You may use Monit. This program regularly checks (on adjustable time interval - 2mins, 5mins...) number of vital system parameters, and is I think even on by default. When parameter () goes out of the adjustable threshold default is to send to you notification email. If this is favourable, you may login via ssh and do and other standard tools in order to gain quick and rough insight about what is happening. Second option would be to configure Monit's custom script execution instead of (or together with) sending of notification email. This custom script may do simple and you would have good starting point to investigate high load averages. 

Honestly can't say WHY you're getting the error without being able to dig around. I would try removing and re-adding all rights/permissions on your My Documents folder, to make sure you don't have some wierd sub-permission set on it. As a work-around you might also try something like Unlocker. It may actually be that some kind of process has the file locked.... $URL$ 

I can't speak to "5-6 TB of data", but I currently have 1700 full time fat-client users (Application built in .NET) hammering against a 1.5 TB database using SQL 64bit Itanium. It performs fine. I think the scaling question is not so much the size of the DB, as it is the number of users and transactions per second. Oracle can do clustering to expand capacity as far as transactions/second (in certain circumstances) but I wouldn't necessarily prefer either one regarding raw DB size. 

IF the SQL Agent job is actually finishing. (And that's a big 'if') then the last step of the job could use xpcmdshell to fire psservice (from the PSTOOLS suite) and tell the SQL Server service to restart. It's real bad kludge-ey. But it could be done. 

Keep in mind that you do have unofficial, of-the-record and very, very, very important limits in sending emails to ESP giants like Google, Microsoft and Yahoo, and probably more. While you are limited only by hardware performance and your ISP's network infrastructure (and possibly policy) in terms of sending emails with Postfix (to extend Simon Greenwood's answer) "giant ESPs" and some spam protection software can induce you more trouble than you asked for if you do not keep your server from sending at some reasonable rate. I suggest you read awesome Postfix rate limiting â€“ Politeness goes a long way article to get some usable info. 

EDIT (12.12.2017) This is a component of some email security software, not sure what kind exactly, and does not operate by (or, at least not solely by) local settings. So, this software has some kind of centralized black list and contacting administrator of other email server, although may solve specific case by manual whitelisting IP address is not good enough option. Now, the question is, how to get out of this list? 

On your local machine, (The "admin" box that has the external hd plugged in) share a folder on the external hd with "everyone", full rights. On the remote server, start:run, type \adminbox\newsharename Once you can browse that unc from your rdp session on the remote db server, you'll be able to back up to it using sql studio. 

It sounds like your email sending function is outside the loop, and is followed by either an exit statement or the end of the script. Can you just put the email sending function within the loop? You'll probably need to add a counter that will establish a time or repetition-based hold so that it doesn't immediately get in a loop of re-emailing you, but that's not too hard. If you do that, then the script won't exit the loop at all: it'll send and email and go back to checking for the file. 

I use PolyMon to monitor these kinds of things. You can define various "alert" conditions about which you'd like to receive notification, so I get notified if one of my servers is having a problem. But it also stores all these results in a long term database, so I can look back at the memory usage of server "X" and see it's memory usage trends over the last N days/weeks/months/years. $URL$ 

This configuration should limit 4 emails per 2 minutes, thus 120 per hour - but I'm not sure if it works. 

In order to diagnose why emails are not being sent, in your situation (full control over the system), it is especially important to distinguish whether this is at application or system/email level. You gave us very little details about your issue. Consider: 

You might be looking for nice command in Linux/UNIX. Basically, what it does is running a command with a modified scheduling priority. PHP might not help if running task is heavy by itself - without repeating. 

Since no one answered: Clearswift Secure Email Gateway is an email security software and they are in charge of their internal blacklist and the 'world outside' does not know on basis of what criteria this blacklist is established and maintained. So, if you got new IP address which gets rejected with error message posted above you have option to contact and ask them to remove your IP address from their blacklist. 

I'm not after services that could provide me with fancy fine-grained control like , I don't need per user/domain control, I only want to: 

I'm going to venture outside the "standard" reply and guess that what you need may be less a "centralized infrastructure" (single domain) and more of a centralized management tool. You might have a look at something like Italc. $URL$ It provides you a central command/control console, a singular view of your PC fleet. You'll still have to treat each PC individually, but you can do it all from one place both in the geographical and logical sense. And it's free... 

If you're truly asking, "can users run an interactive program without being logged into Windows" then the answer is "No." But if you mean, "Can users run an interactive program without having to know or enter their Windows credentials" then the answer is yes: you simply set up an auto-login process, and as soon as the PC boots, the user is ready to run an interactive session. You can set particular programs up to autorun, so that the user doesn't even need to launch them. 

My personal approach would be to buy a $400-500 notebook, and throw 3 or 4 gb or ram in it. In my view, you can get a lot of machine for that money. But I personally just bought an ASUS 8.9" netbook because I'm REALLY cheep. The tiny keyboard takes a little getting used to, but for sub $200, I'm very pleased.
