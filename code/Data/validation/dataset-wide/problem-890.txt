That is also the only point on Earth where an observer on the surface would see the Sun "directly overhead", at the very top of the apparent dome of the sky. So even if you stripped away the Earth's atmosphere, only at this point on the Earth would the power reaching a square meter of the surface be equal to the solar constant, the average power per square meter over the entire illuminated half of the Earth's surface would be less than the solar constant since most of the surface is at an angle relative to incoming rays. Incidentally, the angle of the surface relative to incoming rays is also the main reason why at Northern latitudes, it's warmer in the summer (when the surface at a Northern latitude is closer to being perpendicular to oncoming rays) than in the winter (when the surface is at a more inclined angle relative to incoming rays), as illustrated in a diagram from this page: 

After doing research it said that nebulas are made of gas and dust. Are they actually gases and solids, or are they plasma? 

In a way. Light particles (photons) take eight minutes to travel from the sun to the Earth. Because it takes these particle eight minutes to reach us, we see the sun as it appeared eight minutes ago. Another example in the Andromeda Galaxy, in which it takes 2.5 million years for light to reach Earth. That's basically what a light year is, the distance at which how long i takes the light to reach Earth. So we are seeing the Andromeda Galaxy as it was 2.5 million years ago. In conclusion, in measuring distance in light years, light hours, light days etc., we are seeing how long ago it appeared as far away as it currently is. From Earth. Like I said, the sun is 8 light minutes away from Earth, so we are seeing it as it appeared eight minutes ago. 

The most probable banana-shaped region stretches from Crux to the Large Magellanic cloud. Comparing the image with a constellation map, there are several small constellations that may have hosted the event. Those are Mensa, Chamaeleon, Musca and Crux. 

Yes, GW has Doppler shift too, as they are travelling at a finite speed, but no, there are no emission or absorption lines we can detect it from. In EM radiation those are caused by the fact that light is quantized, such that certain wavelengths can be absorbed or emitted by atoms. As far as we know, gravity is not quantized, or the effect is too small to be measured. Any irregularity in the signal is then going to be continuous, and not wavelength specific. Detecting a spectra in gravitational waves is unlikely, but would strengthen the theories of quantum gravity and the graviton. 

The moon will never spiral away. In case you did not know, the moon is moving away from Earth a tiny bit each year due to tidal effects and when Earth always has one side facing the moon, the moon will stop moving away. When they are tidally locked (always have one side facing each other) the will rotate at nearly the same speed. 

Yes, that is what it means. Pretty much each star in the Milky Way that does not orbit another star or object revolves around the SMBH. All planetary systems (solar systems) in our galaxy revolve around that point. It'a likely that most galaxies have supermassive black holes at their centers, so usually each system orbits the SMBH(s) at the center. There actually may be more than one at the center, and in that case, the the stars and other objects will revolve around that system of supermassive black holes. But however, the SMBH isn't enough to keep the galaxy together. It also needs some of the gravity from the stars, nebulae, planets etc. that make it up. 

The Earth is a very smooth sphere, and the Sun even more so, with only minor fluctuations. I am wondering: are larger stars even rounder? Intuitively, that seems self evident, but I am not so sure. For instance, the hydrostatic equilibrium causes larger stars to be much less dense than red dwarfs. So what is the most important factor for how round a star is, a higher mass, or less activity? The most prominent cause of irregularities is of course the rotation rate of the star, which is pretty much independent of size. Ignoring that, do larger stars have smaller a deviations from the ellipsoid relative to their size? Edit As it seems like the "other than rotation rate" criterion is not really meaningfull, I now terminate it. 

The solar constant is defined to be the power you get on such a surface of unit area if it's not being obstructed by atmospheric particles, and if it's oriented perpendicular to incoming rays so that it receives the maximum possible power at that location. One aspect of the orientation issue that's important to understand is that if you orient your solar collector so that it's parallel to the ground (so that it would be lying flat if it was actually at ground level), then it will only receive the maximum power if the surface of the Earth is itself perpendicular to incoming rays from the Sun at that point, which is not true in the above diagram. It would only be true at the point on Earth that's the dead "center" of the Earth as seen by an observer looking at it from the Sun's position, or the point where the gray line connecting the centers of Earth and Sun intersects with surface of the Earth on this diagram: 

Before the nuclear fusion in the core starts, the heat of the star comes from the contraction of the original nebula. When the matter comes closer together, the potential energy of it decreases, just like when you drop a rock. Energy is however constant, so it has to go somewhere. That "somewhere" is the heat in the newborn star. 

The data is indeed very uncertain. As for GW150914, LIGO posted this image of the probable area of the sky: 

Yes, there are electrons inside stars, they have not gone anywhere. I must say your new theory of electromagnetic force does not make any sense to me, but there are actually a few cases where electrons "disappears" from a star: First off, the nuclear fusion of 4 hydrogen atoms into one helium atom actually consumes electrons. Let us count the particles before and after: Before: 

But again, this bound should be the upper limit on the entropy of a given region, not necessarily the actual entropy in that region, so this type of holographic bound shouldn't imply that when we increase the entropy of the universe, the universe needs to grow. This paper specifically discusses how most matter-containing regions in cosmology apart from black holes would fail to "saturate" the covariant entropy bound, meaning that the actual entropy in the region is smaller than the maximum possible according to the bound. 

So apparently the "covariant entropy bound" (also known as Bousso's holographic bound) is the thing to look into when considering the maximum entropy of the universe (and I assume you just mean the observable universe here rather than whatever may lie beyond it). This set of lecture slides by Raphael Bousso, the physicist who originally proposed the covariant entropy bound, says that this bound is "conjectured to hold in arbitrary spacetimes, including cosmology." But it also says "If correct, origin must lie in quantum gravity", probably meaning one can't derive this fact in a non-conjectural way from basic laws of physics without having a complete theory of quantum gravity. For an introduction to this stuff, I recommend this Scientific American article that discusses various holographic bonds, including the Bekenstein bound along with Bousso's conjectured more general bound (the article was written by Bekenstein himself). Though it is from 2003 so I'm not sure what kind of theoretical progress has been made since then. Anyway, here's what it says about Buosso's entropy bound: 

That's a really good question. I'll explain as best as I can, there are about a number of ways this can happen. 

This may sound a little bit confusing, but I will try to explain. (I have done research on this topic already) I have looked at the temperatures of planets and I was wondering, is there a point where a planet is at perigee and it's temperature cannot reach any higher? Let's just say the planet is tidally locked, and is currently at perigee. Would the planet be at a point where it's temperature can no longer be increased at the current distance from its star? 

Usually, when a star dies, it will usually form a planetary nebula or supernova and most of this matter will reach the interstellar medium. When it collapses due to some disturbance, a protoplanetary disk forms, it will cool off eventually. Once it is low enough temperature to form compounds, usually molecular hydrogen (H2) will form first. Here is something that may help you: No, H2O cannot exist in stars, but H and O separately can. Hydrogen is the basic building material of the universe, created in the Big Bang. Oxygen is created by nuclear reactions in stars. If you put H and O together in the cold of space, you get H2O. There are enormous amounts of water in space. In fact, nearly all of the oxygen in space is in the form of water or carbon monoxide. Similarly, most the carbon and nitrogen in space are also in their most hydrogenated forms: methane (CH4) and ammonia (NH3). (Source) Since water is H2O, it is likely to form because nebulae contain so much hydrogen and some oxygen. The Earth was most likely hit by comets and asteroids that contained water, and when our planet cooled off, we got our oceans. 

It's true that since the Earth is not a point, an observer in the upper atmosphere directly above that point on the surface would not be at exactly the same radius from the Sun as the radius of Earth's orbit (defined in terms of the position of the center of the Earth), but if you actually do the calculation of the solar constant at the radius of Earth's center vs. the radius of the point on the surface that's closest to the Sun, the difference is very small so it can be ignored if you're only stating the solar constant to nearest Watt/meter^2 or even the nearest tenth of a Watt/meter^2. The nominal solar luminosity is defined to be $3.828 \times 10^{26}$ and 1 AU is defined as 149597870700 meters, and if you use the formula you mentioned to calculate the solar flux at 1 AU it works out to 1361.1664654 watts per square meter. The radius of the Earth at the equator is about 6378 meters, so at an equinox when the Sun is directly overhead at the equator, an observer seeing the Sun directly overhead should be at a distance of 149597870700 - 6378 = 149597864322 meters, if you use the same formula to calculate the solar flux at this radius you get 1361.1665815, so it only makes a different if you want precision beyond the second decimal place. 

Distance is an ambiguous term that can mean both centre-centre and surface-surface depending on the context it is used. 

Is the Earth spinning? That depends, you can always choose a frame of reference that suits you. However, only one of them are non-rotating, the Inertial frame. In all the others we have fictitious forces acting, like centrifugal or Coriolis forces. We can test if the Earth rotates by watching a pendulum throughout a day. The pendulum would then seem to slowly rotate during this period of time, meaning some fictitious "force" is acting on it. That means that we are located in a rotating frame of reference, and thus the Earth rotates. 

You would not actually be able to see that much, the sunlight is less than 4% of the strength at Earth's distance to the Sun. That is still enough to see though (Much brighter than Moon light at night in fact). The problem is the transparency of the atmosphere; we can not look in, you can not look out. You would only see a weak brown or red glow below the cloud cover. However, there is plenty of lightning! Strong winds and thunder exist too.
