How is universal, necessary knowledge possible? What makes a sentence like true? What explains why different objects are members of the same kind? 

I've never heard one, but "encapsulation" seems like as good a term to use as any. I think you'd probably have to define it if you wanted to use it in a paper, but it seems like a useful concept. 

A helpful introductory sort of book is David Albert's, Quantum Mechanics and Experience. Lawrence Sklar's Philosophy of Physics is a bit older, but might be useful if you're looking for a broader introduction to the general philosophy of physics. There's also a collection of papers edited by Lawrence Sklar, Physical Theory: Method and Interpretation that might be of interest. Finally, a more advanced book, that attempts to defend the relevance of metaphysical theory to the practice of physics is Tim Maudlin's The Metaphysics Within Physics. 

These are different substantive positions on the free will issue. Each different metaphysical problem (what are laws of nature? what are numbers? how do dispositions work?) will have a variety of different substantive positions like this, and I don't see any common features those answers share that would allow us to categorize them any more specifically. 

(2 isn’t important for this discussion) Utilitarians and others who view morality as involving maximizing argue for 1 on the grounds that it is just part of the nature of reasoning about action that if x is better than y, then we should choose x over y. Think of an example: $1000 can buy all the same goods and services that $100 can buy, plus more. Therefore it is better to have $1000 than $100. If, therefore, I can choose between receiving $1000 and $100, all other things being equal, the only reasonable choice is $1000, because that is the choice that maximizes my benefit. Moral theories that deny 1 above, are committed to saying there are some reasons to choose $100 over $1000, other things being equal. And this, utilitarians say, is absurd. But utilitarians also have to distinguish their views from another position called egoism. Like utilitarians, egoists say morality is about maximizing, however egoists think I should always act to maximizes my own benefit. Utilitarians disagree. According to Utilitarians, our maximizing calculations should be “agent-neutral”, i.e. no particular person’s happiness is weighted more than another’s. And that is just what 1 above says. For these two reasons, utilitarians have to endorse 1. If they argued that what maters is average happiness, they would have to admit that there could be good reasons to choose $100 over $1000, other things being equal, which would then give them no reason to say moral theories based on exceptionless rules, like Kant’s, are wrong. Further, utilitarians have to make their conception of maximization agent neutral to keep their views from devolving into egoism. There is an additional complication here caused by two different ways of conceiving what one is trying to maximize (whether one is maximizing the utility caused by a specific action [Act utilitarianism] or whether one is trying to maximize the utility caused by society adopting a specific rule [rule utilitarianism]). But we need not go into that because even rule utilitarians have to agree with 1 and therefore can’t adopt a principle of increasing average utility. 

Just to throw my $0.02 in here. I think Aaronson is really poorly informed about the majority of with the field of professional philosophy as it is practiced today. Here's some examples: 

I'm not sure I understand the question fully, so let me see if I can sharpen it up a little bit. Is your question: Is there a set of possible answers that could in principle be given to any given philosophical question? If that's your question the answer is No. Different kinds of problems are going to have different kinds of possible answers that could be given to them. The space of possible answers is probably smallest in logic. One kind of question that comes up in logic is: Can one create a formal system with property P? And there the answer is either yes or no. But it also often happens that there is a question like Does claim p follow from axioms a, b, and c in system s? and there there are three possible answers that might be given: provably yes *provably no* or undecidable. In metaphysics it gets much more complicated. Take the question of free will and determinism that you mention. Some people might want to say there's not really a question worth trying to figure here. There are two different ways to make an argument like that: 

On the correspondence view, it seems most plausible to think truth is utterly unconnected with belief. Since the world is the way it is independent of our beliefs about it, therefore sentences about the world are either true or false, regardless of whether we exist or not. On the coherence view truth definitely would require belief because for a sentence to be true is, as it were, for that sentence to be connected to other sentences we take to be true. Coherence theorists must reject the idea that there could be truths which nobody ever in principle could know. On the pragmatist view of truth, its harder to tell. Some pragmatists, such as Susan Haack and Cheryl Misak (I think) want to suggest that the pragmatist view of truth turns out to be very similar to the correspondence theory in point of fact. So, I take it that these pragmatists also wouldn't necessarily have a problem with saying that a sentence could be true even if nobody in fact (at the present time) believes it. However, like correspondence theorists, they would want to reject the idea that there could be a truth that nobody knows. Now the curious thing about the literature on truth is that there aren't really good arguments for each of these views. The main argument for the correspondence view is just that it seems very plausible and intuitive and fits with our pretheoretical judgment that truths about the world are discovered rather than made. (I think something like that must be what Neil deGrasse Tyson means in the quote above.) Further, the correspondence view seems to avoid important problems the other views have. The coherence theory, for instance, seems to let too many things count as true. Imagine a really nice, consistent fictional world present in a novel. If coherence theory of truth is right, then a sentence is true if and only if it coheres with other sentences, so if the fictional story is coherent, it's literally true. In other words, if the Lord of the Rings is a highly consistent set of sentences, then there are such things as Dragons, Elves, Orcs and so on. This looks like an important difficulty for the coherence theory. Another difficulty, which the coherence theory shares with the pragmatist theory is that it seems to require that there simply couldn't be such a thing as an unknowable truth. (Note that it's an unknownable truth. Everyone wants to say there are truths that aren't in fact known; the question is whether there are truths that nobody could know.) There's an important paradox called Fitch's Paradox that is supposed to show that actually if you hold that all truths can in principle be known, then all truths must be actually known. This is a surprising result! (Unless you take the pragmatist theory of truth to provide an argument for the existence of an omniscient God.) But furthermore, the pragmatist theory of truth faces the difficulty that there are some problems in logic and mathematics that are provably undecidable. That means that it can be proven that there cannot be a proof of certain questions one way or another. Yet, these are question in logic, so it seems like they should have answers and that their answers should be not only true, but necessarily true. Of course, the correspondence theory faces it's own challenges. The primary challenge is to make sense of the notion of "correspondence" and to say what the correspondence between the world and the sentence is supposed to consist in.
