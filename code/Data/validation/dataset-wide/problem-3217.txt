Performing first a search for all occurrences of "German" and then of "civiliz" in The Gallic Wars suggests that the most relevant passage is from Chapter 24 from Book 6 (my emphasis): 

Vichy Terms: Under terms of the surrender, the Vichy government was only allowed to maintain an internal army of 95,000 (all ranks) plus a gendarmerie of 60,000 and an anti-aircraft force of 10,000. There were an additional 145,000 or so Vichy forces in Algeria, Morocco and the Levant, making a total force under arms of barely 300,000. Since some 2,000,000 soldiers had been captured by the Germans in the spring 1940 campaign and retained under the treaty terms as forced labour, it is difficult to see how the Vichy forces were ever even comparable to the forces fielded by France in 1940. 

Understanding this development first requires a discussion of various sailing rigs. Further, to understand the consequences of various sail plan decisions, one must need understand the points of sail, from close-hauled, through beam reach, to running. When running-before-the-wind a sailing vessel is very comfortable, with the deck flat, hull stable in the water, and wave action minimal. However you can only go downwind, and never even as fast as the wind itself. If the breeze is only 3 knots, then 2 or 2.5 is as fast as the vessel can go. Square-rigged vessels are ideal for this point of sail, with the rig itself stable on top of the beneficial attributes mentioned above. To minimize drag, and thus maximize speed, the sail(s) must be centred about the boat. Viking longships typify this type of vessel. Over time, sailors realized that by using sheets (ie ropes, not sails as the uninitiated might think) to angle the sail and supporting spar into the wind, plus a rear-mounted rudder, points of sail several degrees off of straight downwind could be achieved. Even more remarkable, the boat was now capable of sailing faster than the wind itself. The slight heel and increased wave action of the vessel was a very minor inconvenience by comparison. For square-rigged vessels, the limit of this gain is obtained at a beam reach or a very slight close reach. Although the vessels could make headway while pointed to within about 60 degrees of the wind, the leeway encountered ensured that the velocity made good to windward was minimal at best. In any sort of unfavourable wave action, VMG would be negative, and the vessel was better to anchor and wait for more favourable conditions. This is why one will so often hear of square-rigged vessels being stuck, either in or outside of a port, waiting on a favourable wind. The large tidal range of Southern England allowed the squadrons of Hawkins and Drake to make sea despite the mildly unfavourable wind conditions when the Armada was spotted! In order to sail upwind at all a vessel requires a fore-and-aft-rig, with either gaff or lateen sails. These rigs generate substantial aerodynamic lift from the sails which, when the vessel also gains hydrodynamic lift from a well designed keel, can enable efficient sailing to within 45 degrees (30 degrees for some very high-tech modern vessels) of the wind. Top speed relative to wind speed steadily decreases from its peak at beam reach, but if the leeway is managed by a well designed keel the VMG upwind obtained by tacking on the wind shifts can be considerable. The ship is heeled well over at this point of sail, is trickier to steer, and suffers more from wave action, but need not wait on the wind. So with all that our of the way, why three-masted vessels? Because it allowed a single ship to combine multiple rigs. Theoretically a single massive mast is most efficient, but that only works for carbon-fibre masts with small crews. A wooden ship with wooden masts achieves an even larger sail area with multiple masts, for the cost of additional crew. By pushing the fore-mast and bow-sprit further forward on the vessel, balanced by sails on the mizzen mast to keep the bow from digging into the water, even a square-rigger can make some headway upwind. 

This additional term to Ampere's Law is discussed in the Wikipedia article on Maxwell's Equations. So yes, the consolidation of the four separate laws discovered by Gauss, Faraday and Ampere very much is a contribution unique to Maxwell, though individual laws still carry the names of their original discoverers, and are taught in that way in elementary physics curricula. 

For British nobility (as opposed to royalty above) it is traditional for the heir of a peer to hold a courtesy title selected from the lesser titles held by the peer. In the case of a Duke this is most often a title of marquess, but may be earl or viscount depending on the lesser titles available. The heir of an heir in turn may be granted a courtesy title (from those available) at least one step down from his parent, and so on, until only Lord is available. Note that while holding only a courtesy title, such an heir would be eligible to sit in the House of Commons, not (yet) being a Peer eligible to sit in the House of Lords. For German nobility it was common for a nobles heir to prefix his parent's title with "Erb", as in "Erbgraf". William Addams Reitwiesner writes: 

The technology to determine the narrowest point in northern England is as nothing compared to that necessary for supplying Roman towns with running water and baths, as with the Nimes Aqueduct in Southern France, shown here at the Pont du Gard crossing of Gardon River. 

As there is no category in either the Lieber Code or the current Geneva Convention that would qualify the "Japanese Americans forced into concentration camps during WWII " as POW's, it is simply a gross misuse of the language to claim otherwise. 

These three maps clearly outline, in varying level of detail, the portions of Czechoslovakia that were annexed by Nazi Germany in 1938. As the definition of "Sudetenland" has almost no meaning apart from this annexation, they comprise a de facto meaning of the term. As illustrated below, the city of Plzen was just outside the boundaries of Sudetenland as defined above. 

The available Calendars are listed below with their respective representation of today, March 1, 2014: 

The implication seems to be that other forms of torture, such as the boot and the rack, were far more effective at obtaining confessions and witness testimony than branding irons. 

There was very intentionally no national character to be associated with the ensign. Update In particular, the A pennant already had the meaning: 

The Soviet state would crumble; Serious civilian discontent with Nazi occupation would cease; Only a minimal garrison of occupied Russia and Ukraine would be necessary to maintain order; and No continuance of war from the Urals would be contemplated by the rump Soviet government or its successors. 

Later he recaps the manner in which initial investigation of homicides was performed, and the subsequent proceedings. (pp 422) 

One must be very careful when reading the ancients to not impose modern interpretation, laden as it is with understanding acquired with the aid of the microscope, on ancient texts. Words like atom and element are bandied about, but their meaning is significantly different than today's, aided as it is by chemical understanding wholly obtained in the 19th century. For instance, in The Nature of Things Lucretius uses the word atom both in places where a modern understanding would require molecule as well as in places where the modern word atom is accurate. Likewise his use of the word element is frequently used in places to denote what we would now call a pure compound. Our modern access to observation through optical and electronic microscopes gives us a much richer base of observations upon which to reason. Therefore as blood would be regarded by Lucretius as the wettest humour of the body, it would be inconceivable to him to infer a wetness for the body in excess of that of blood. And without the aid of a microscope the highest reasonable wetness that could be inferred for blood would be the 55% plasma content observable by allowing blood to settle at cool temperatures. (A centrifuge speeds this process but is not essential.) Note that much of the body's water content, more than a third, is wholly contained within the cells of the body and is thus not observable with the naked eye. On page 117 of Watson's translation of Lucretius mist and water are noted as being different substances, though noting that they are one and the same is actually a naked-eye observation that, with care, could be made. Therefore it is inconceivable to me that any ancient could have logically inferred a water content for the body in excess of about 55%. 

According to Churchill in Their Finest Hour, chapter 3, on May 22 and 23 the B.E.F. and French forces were attempting to break out of the encirclement by attacking S.W. from Arras and vicinity. Again in chapter 4, Churchill reports that a German message was intercepted in clear at 11:42 a.m. on May 24, halting the Panzers on the line Dunkirk-Hazebrouck-Meyville. Finally, Churchill has General Gort, on the evening of the 25th of May, ordering an abandonment of the attempt to break out of the pocket, a consolidation of the perimeter centred around Dunkirk, and a march to the sea. The motivation for this change of plan is given as the realization that the Belgian forces holding the northern flank of the perimeter were about to be overrun by German infantry. It is certain that no evacuation would have started prior to these events having played out, there being as yet no forces on the beaches of Dunkirk to evacuate. 

Details are very fragmentary here - all I recall is that for several weeks Rob and my Dad were passed by the Resistance north towards Appledorn and then Staphorst. For a couple of weeks they were put up separately in Staphorst with two farming families. In 1969 my parents, brother and I had an opportunity to visit, and personally thank, the family that my father stayed with in Staphorst. Several weeks on they were then moved west and finally south again to Schiedam. 

By this logic, as the extreme lead pollution of Mexico City is inescapable by its poor citizens, acknowledging the consequent measured loss of IQ (estimated to be 20 points last I read) by their children is racism. 

Thanks to @bof for reminding me of Pocahontas as well, who was kidnapped and held for ransom by the colonists of Jamestown and subsequently married John Rolfe. She was a daughter of Powhatan, the paramount chief of an alliance of Algonquian tribes in what is now coastal Virginia. 

And this is just to ensure that (and which, as Berthier was causing the marshals to perform much retrograde marching until Napoleon's arrival in Bavaria) orders were received and correctly implemented. It is very possible that the first full concept of an after action report originates at this time, as Napoleon originated the "Chief of Staff" concept with Berthier. (Note that at this time the designation "Major General" is a position, specifically that of Chief of Staff, and not a rank. Berthier was a General de Division (rank) and Marshal of France (properly a title, though often treated by its holders as a rank) like any other senior French Commander of the time. The Prussian General Staff formation and army reorganization that was occurring at this same time would formalize the structure beyond Napoleon's "proof of concept". 

and through to the Geneva Convention (III) relative to the Treatment of Prisoner of War, 12 August 1949: 

From the above, and reading between the lines, it is soon obvious why French kings were so eager to supply mercenaries to various English factions during the *Wars of the Roses. It immediately resulted in various trouble-making bodies relocating offshore, who when dismissed half-paid would then pillage the English countryside until apprehended or re-hired elsewhere. In that circumstance, if I were the French king I think I would lend money to various English factions to get them started on transporting my unwanted mercenaries to England. Oh! Wait! Isn't that exactly what various French kings actually did? 

Note item (6) - New Harbour Entrance on your map. This entrance was constructed in 147 B.C. (the third year of the siege) simultaneous with item (7) - Scipio's Mole blocking the original entrance. During the siege the Carthaginians were able to continue trading overseas, albeit with limited success because of Rome's influence. The Siege was prosecuted incompetently for the first two years. Only with the election as Consul of Scipio Aemilianus for 147 B.C. were the Romans finally successful in prosecuting the siege. Scipio arranged to construct the eponymous Mole and finally restored morale to the Roman troops enabling them to breach the walls and begin the house-to-house elimination of the garrison and conquest of the city. Also, as shown here modern Tunis averages 45 cm of rainfall annually, and is very near the site of Carthage. This is roughly what both Aruba and Bonaire receive annually and seems adequate to refresh cisterns for quite some time if provision exists for capturing it as is done on those two islands.
