So my question is, which one gives a better result for the effective rate of return of an invesment and why? Thanks very much in advance. 

My book says the way we calculate real GDP in a given year is by adding the quantities of all goods and services produced in that year multiplied by their prices in some base year. There are actually two things I can't quite get: 

What I did was take the partial derivative of $Q$ with respect to $Y$, wich is equal to $2$, and multiply this result by $100$ to get the resulting change in $Q=200$. However, according to the answer provided in the book, a $\$100$ increase in income causes the quantity demanded to increase by $0.2$ million kg per year. So, what am I missing out on here? Thanks in advance. 

How do we account for goods and services that exist now but weren't around in the base year? I mean, especially today, with things such as the market for apps, startups, and the increasing number of new products that get released on an almost daily basis, wouldn't the real GPD calculated that way become dated really fast? This might turn out to be a really silly question, but how do we take into account quantities of services that are provided in a given year, such as lawyer services, marketing services etc.? All examples I've seen of calculating real GDP were of the sort "consider an economy that produces only apples an orange...". 

I've just started studying Macroeconomics and I have a quick doubt about the following problem from Mankiw's Macroeconomics 7th edition, page 81: 

My book states that one factor defining a perfectly competitive market is its participants having full information about prices and product characteristics. I can understand how having perfect information about prices promotes price taking behaviour (you can't charge me a higher price for your product if I know I can buy it cheaper from other producers). However, why exactly is having full information about product characteristics important for characterizing perfect competition? Thanks in advance. 

Where $P$ is the initial value invested, $N$ is the nominal interest rate and $I$ is the inflation rate. However, I've seen an alternative formula for calculating the same thing, which is 

According to the solution manual, the answer is that "real GDP falls because Disney does not produce any services while it is closed". However, I wonder if it's not possible that real GDP remains constant in that scenario, for instance, if people decides to spend whatever they were going to spend at Disney on other goods and services? Then, if the fall in Disney's production were fully offset by the increased production of substitutes for Disney's services, could real GDP remain unchanged? Is my reasoning correct? Thanks. 

Can a univariate model like ARIMA represent a rational expectations equilibrium? Not really. Most economics theory employ rational expectations that lead to a nonlinear system of equations (in multiple variables) that describe the model's dynamics. Often, these are approximated (e.g., log-linear approximation), so that they can be solved and estimated using something like a linear state space model---but many still require multiple variables (here, arranged in a vector) to describe the full dimensionality of the model. For an example of one particular model that uses rational expectations, see p. 30 of "Recursive Models of Dynamic Linear Economics" by Hansen and Sargent. 

How should I understand the sample points $\omega \in \Omega$ and the transformation $\mathbb S$ in this construction? (Could $\omega$ be something like a sequence of shocks in certain cases?) For more concreteness, how would I write these two processes in this notation? Process 1: $$ X_{t+1} = \rho X_t + \varepsilon_{t+1} \tag{1} $$ where $X_0 = 0$. Process 2: $$ X_{t+1} = \varepsilon_{t+1} \tag{2} $$ 

An important detail that is missing is a discussion of the theorem's significance. The Hansen-Jagannathan (H-J) bound gives us a type of mean-variance frontier. But what is importance/significance (in theoretical and empirical work) of the H-J bound over the classic mean-variance efficient frontier? (The two are different but related. What's the main insight from the H-J bound?) 

(Sufficient when (1) also adds that the good is so inferior that the income effect is greater than the substitution effect.) A Giffen good does not generate utility directly through its price. Contrast this to a Veblen good where there the user actually derives utility directly from the price. See this link for some info about empirical evidence. 

Here's a little discussion that might help. The population version has a solution because it is assumed to have a solution. You can see that this is the case from assumptions 3.1 (linearity), 3.3 (orthogonality conditions), and 3.4 (rank condition for identification). You can see the derivation of this fact from equations (3.3.3) and (3.3.4). Now, you'll notice the population version having a solution implies that $$ \text{rank}\left( \Sigma_{xz} \right ) = \text{rank}\left(\left [\Sigma_{xz} \mid \sigma_{xy} \right ]\right ), $$ as discussed in exercise 5 of section 3.3. In the hint they note that the population version has a solution when $$ \left [\Sigma_{xz} \mid \sigma_{xy} \right ] $$ is of rank $L$. If it has rank $L+1$, it will not have a solution. In the hint, they say that this is a set of "equality conditions." This is referring to the fact that one of the columns must be a linear combination of the remaining columns. This is a very hard condition to satisfy. In many models, this condition will hold with probability zero. This is because the data has to come out so that the equality condition holds perfectly. On the other hand, the condition that the sample version $S_{xy}$ of $\sum_{xz}$ be of full column rank is a set of "inequality" conditions on the matrix. Because they are inequality conditions on the matrix, they are much easier to satisfy by chance. In conclusion, $S_{xy}$ will have full column rank for sufficiently large $n$ because the conditions are inequality conditions which occur with probability larger than zero. However, to have a solution we need $\left [S_{xz} \mid s_{xy} \right ]$ to have rank $L$. But because this is an equality condition on the matrix, it only occurs with probability zero.

I've read a title in the news proposing a zero corporate tax. Thinking about it I couldn't figure a good reason against. Why couldn't a country just set the corporate tax rate for firms to zero and then tax any gain obtained via negotiating shares or receiving dividends? Tracking the latters seems way easier (via a digital national registry of ownership and trades and mandating disclosure of dividends ) than burdening firms with complicated tax codes and the state with the burden of chasing them. I am sure I am missing some theoretical and real world complications, so please, enlighten me. 

You seem to think of a game where objects are obtained at a fixed rate by farming. Fix supply of work for a certain object (bc. Only a few people know where to find things to farm or are high enough level or have the right profession) and increase demand (new players coming in or more players buying in game currency for real money) then prices for the object will soar over time, people producing the object will find it easier to sell it, so much so that they will increase the price until people stop buying it. This will inflate the price of the object. Whether this will last over longer period of time then depends on many factors : ability of supply to adjust (e.g. How much are player willing to switch to farming that object?), rate of new player characters coming in, their propensity to buy the object etc. There are many other ways. One example I could think of: as a player on a WoW private server with moderate population I would routinely buy all objects from the auction house that I thought of as undervalued and put them back in auction at higher prices. This allowed me to gain arbitrage profit from less careful players and also to craft and sell the same object at higher prices. 

It depends on the definition you want to use. You can define a regressive tax as the wiki says, in which case a sale tax would not match. But the goal of definition of different class of taxation is to assess the impact on person being taxed. Without considering income the above definition becomes moot. Sure the tax is proportional (fixed share of tax on any price) but it's effect on those who pay it is different. The first definition is derived , I believe, in the context of income taxes in which the income is being taxed and the definition matches it's intuitive notion. Some taxation system are subject to the requirement that the system as a whole should be progressive, I.e the total tax burden should increase with income. In this context is natural to think that sale taxes are regressive, while they don't match the formal definition. 

This is meant to add to @BKay's answer. Here are some examples that might help to see what's happening when a bank makes a loan. A bank's balance sheet The image below is text taken from Greg Mankiw's textbook Macroeconomics (7th edition, p. 555). This is a simplified version of a typical bank's balance sheet. Notice that reserves, loans, and securities are considered assets and that deposits, debt, and equity are considered liabilities. 

(How would I formalize this concept?) EDIT: Also, in Financial Asset Pricing Theory by Munk (chapter 10, p.371) it says 

Theory about the minimum wage Also, it's worth pointing out that besides empirical studies (like Card and Krueger), there are in fact theoretical reasons why a minimum wage might be welfare improving---see Lee and Saez (2012). (I'm just saying they exists, not commenting on the strength of the results.) In the Handbook of Public Economics, chapter 7, "Optimal Labor Income Taxation", they say this about that paper: 

gives us (in TeXForm for clarity) $$ \begin{align*} \left\{\left\{f(a,t)\to \\ \text{f0}(a-t) \cdot \\ \exp \left(\int_1^a -d(K[1],K[1]-a+t) \, dK[1]-\int_1^{a-t} -d(K[1],K[1]-a+t) \, dK[1]\right)\right\}\right\} \end{align*} $$ 

The fact that you ask about "safety" implies that you believe that some result is in jeopardy. This answer can be improved if you can specify a result that you might have in mind. Otherwise, take as an example the first and second welfare theorems. They do not rely on decreasing marginal utility. If you're concerned about results about preferences over uncertainty (ideas about risk aversion, etc.) then recall that although a standard utility function representation of preferences without uncertainty is unique up to a positive monotonic transformation, a Von Neumann-Morgenstern utility function representation of preferences over uncertainty is unique only up to positive affine transformations. EDIT: Extra Notes. The definition of a utility function is given as follows (from Advanced Microeconomic Theory by Jehle and Reny, 2011): 

This is a partial answer (see section 5.1, p. 79 of Cochrane's book, "Asset Pricing"). Suppose you wanted to treat the size of the firm as a factor. Stocks of smaller firms typically have higher average returns. You could then form a "large" holding company comprised of smaller firms. The new, large company would then have returns like a smaller company but would in fact be large and "the managers could enjoy the difference." 

I know how to solve for the optimal trading strategy using the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman approach, but I would like to learn how to do this using the Malliavin calculus and the Clark-Ocone theorem. Duffie's book does not give directions on how to do this. Does anyone know (or can reproduce here) the way in which we would derive the optimal trading strategy this way? (For an easy, clean demonstration, it would be nice to assume, say, $U(c) = E \int_0^\infty \frac{C^{1 - \gamma}}{1 - \gamma}$.)
