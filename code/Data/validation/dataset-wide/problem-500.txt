I'm considering the purchase of a fat bike with a Rock Shox Bluto Fork. This fork takes a 150x50mm Maxle Light and 150mm hub. However, since winter is coming and I'll likely be riding in slop and sub-freezing temps which may affect shock performance and increase the amount of maintenance required, I would like to possibly run a rigid fork during the winter. Are there any rigid forks (steel, aluminum, or carbon) on the market that will accept the 150mm hub standard or would I need to build a totally new front wheel? 

I feel like this is poor design. I have two wheelsets that are less than a year old which have damaged freehub bodys due to cogs digging in to the splines on the freehub. It's so bad that I can't remove the cassette spacer without filing down the splines. I had to use pliers and chain whip to remove the cogs that were embedded in the freehub when trying to remove the cassette. Most of the damage is on the center of the cassette as the largest 3 cogs are held together by carrier. I'm using a shimano 105 cassette and Novatec disc hub and Velocity ATB convertible disc hubs (which were somewhat damaged in the same fashion, but not as bad as the novatec). I'm using this bike for cyclocross, offroad exploring, light singletrack use, Rail trails and some road riding. How can I prevent this damage to the freehub from happening? 

I often find a huge deal of variation due to the tire itself. I've had the same size tires from different brands behave very differently. Sometimes they will become easier to remove and re-install after they are worn in a bit. Sometimes I have to use tire levers to lift the last bit of tire over the lip of the rim, this isn't usually recommended, but sometimes neccesary for extra stubborn tires. If you do resort to this method, then be careful not to pinch the intertube with the levers and be sure that it's not pinched between the rim and the tire when you are done. 

What iOS / iphone app can provide turn by turn navigation of a pre-planned (mostly on road) route (stored in GPX or TCX file)? Voice features are nice, but not mandatory. I've found many apps that will track my ride, or display a route and my position, but none that will direct me when to turn to follow the planned route. This would be very useful when training for an event where gpx files have been provided, or exploring new routes that I plan to ride in unfamiliar territory. I'm ideally looking for something like the android cue sheet app. 

Get a Rain Cape (basically a poncho) if you want to keep drier on the legs without overheating as much. The design diverts water away from your legs and has more ventilation than a standard jacket since it has the open bottom. If you've got fenders to keep the splashing to a minimum, a rain cape, and cheap water resistant pants (for days with heavy rain), then you'll stay pretty dry on your commute. 

Garmin now has a lower cost touring gps that is more suited to navigation than than training. It comes with maps and runs about $250 USD. It's called Garmin Edge Touring. There is a more expensive model which supports a heart rate monitor for about $50 more. I'm guessing this would work well with software like ridewithgps or garmin connect to plan out routes and upload them to the device. Here's a link to the product page: $URL$ Alternatively, if you prefer to use a smartphone and may not be able to charge your phone frequently. I recommend a battery bank charger like the verbatim power bank charger, a dynamo powered usb charger, or solar usb charger (which may work better to charge a battery pack and charge your device from that as needed). Be careful when selecting something like this, since some of these may or may not support the iphone. The new iphone 5s has a special co-processor to handle navigation tasks. This should lead to decreased battery usage over older iphone models. This might be a consideration if your plan is up and were planning on upgrading phones. Keep in mind, you may not always have a data connection with a cell phone in remote areas, so you may need to consider apps that can cache maps offline. 

Unless you're using clipless pedals, you really don't need much in terms of special shoes for cycling. However, there are plenty of advantages to using clipless pedals, so many people choose to use them. The big categories of clipless shoes are: Road shoes tend to have the cleat exposed and you walk on it any time you step. This is really bad for regular wear off the bike. These shoes are meant to be lite and used on the bike. Mountain Bike Shoes tend to allow you to walk around a bit. Some models resemble athletic shoes and some are more firm and the stiff soles make it hard to walk normally. However, you can usually get buy walking a bit in these. I wouldn't want to wear them for extended periods of time off the bike if possible. Urban Shoes (like Chrome and DZR) tend to look like sneakers and feel a lot more like regular shoes. They still contain a cleat mount, but these shoes are designed to blend in like normal shoes and walk a bit better than most other cycling shoes. I've worn Chrome and DZR shoes with SPD cleats around all day and didn't really notice much. The soles are still stiff, so they are a bit different feeling than wakling around in regular shoes. If you pick up a pair of clipless shoes, you'll still probably want to swap them out for regular shoes at the office if you're going to be there for a few hours or more. Regular shoes are going to be more comfortable and your cycling shoes might be a bit sweaty. If you're not planning to pick up clipless shoes, then look for a pair of athletic shoes that doesn't have a lot of flex in the sole when you try to bend the toe downward. A flatter type of tread on the bottom of the shoe will probably help keep you from sliding on the pedals as much too. Skateboard shoes and Adidas Sambas are generally pretty good choices, but pick what works for you. If your commute is short, you can always try your regular office shoes. They may not be 'optimal' for cycling, but you don't always have to have specialized gear to ride a bike. Do what works and what you're comfortable with. 

I purchased a dynamo hub, rim, and spokes for a wheel build. Unknown to me at the time of purchase, I discovered that the spokes all have blue thread locker compound pre-applied to the threads. The spokes are DT Swiss Competition. 1) Do I need to use any other thread-locker or spoke prep? 2) Do I need to lace and tension the wheel all at once, or can I lace it one day, set the nipples to a set start position (with a nipple driver) and then tension it later? 

I've seen security skewers for quick release wheels such as pitlock or pinhead which provide some level of additional security for wheels without carrying bulky locks for wheels (Still wise to use a lock on your frame). With new bike technology and expensive lightweight hub/wheel builds, it seems like it's difficult to find solutions to secure these wheels a bit better than quick release thru axles. Thru axles are commonplace on mountain bikes and becoming more common on road/cross/adventure bikes. Though I have seen options for bolt on thru axles, which at least require an Allen key, I have not really seen the same variety of security skewers that use a specialized tool or key to open. What are my options for skewer based security on thru axle bikes? (May need to consider regular mtb hub spacing, boost, fat bike axle sizes)
