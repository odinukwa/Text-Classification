Hi everyone, I've got a question about explicitly lifting regular sequences. Let $I$ be an ideal in a polynomial ring $S$ with some term order. We'll denote the initial ideal by $in(I)$. It is false in general that a regular sequence on $S/in(I)$ is regular on $S/I$. For example consider $I=(x+y)$, with $x>y$ Then $x+y$ is a regular element on $S/in(I)$ but is not regular on $S/I$. However, $3x-y$ IS a regular element mod $I$. My question is: Can we can do this in general? i.e. Given a regular sequence on $S/in(I)$, can we obtain a regular sequence on $S/I$ by just replacing all the coefficients in all the elements with generic coefficients? We know that the depth of $S/in(I)$ is at most the depth of $S/I$, but I haven't actually seen too many proofs of this written down. The ones I've seen first show a bound on Betti numbers and then use the Auslander-Buchsbaum formula. I was wondering if one could prove this fact by answering the question above, and if anyone has a reference. I think one might be able to use a flat family argument. In general it would be nice to have an explicit way of going back and form between regular sequences on $I$ and $in(I)$. Any reference or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks so much for your help! -Adam 

The study of the renormalization procedure in QFT led to the discovery of the Hopf algebra of rooted trees. Details are given in this paper. 

The fundamental issue here is that mathematics took the wrong direction way back in the mid 1800s when it started to formalize intuitive notions of a continuum using set theory. A lot of work was done to get to a mathematically consistent framework that culminated in modern set theory. From a modern physics point of view, it makes more sense to work within a finitist framework. The formalism of quantum field theory (QFT) involves computing a path integral over all possible field configurations, but this has to be regularized such that it only involves a finite number of degrees of freedom. At the end of the calculations the continuum limit is taken. One can e.g. put the fields on a lattice and then imagine that we exist on such a large scale that we cannot see the lattice spacing. To me this suggests that if QFT (and particularly the way it is used in statistical physics where we start with an underlying discrete model that then leads to a field theory) had been invented a century earlier, mathematics would have taken a different turn. While the intricate details have never been worked out, it's clear that in practice when doing calculus, this would amount to having to take more elaborate limits (e.g. a replacement for continuous functions from $\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$ will have to involve a coarse graining procedure to get to smooth functions in the continuum limit). This may look more complicated, but it's more natural from a physics point of view. 

Let $f:X \to Y$ be a smooth morphism between projective varieties. Suppose $Y$ is a homogeneous space. Under what additional condition on $f$, can we conclude that every fibers of $f$ are isomorphic? 

Fix an integer $N$, $X$ a (smooth) complete intersection subvariety in $\mathbb{P}^N$. Denote by $P$ the Hilbert polynomial of $X$ (as a subvariety in $\mathbb{P}^N$). Consider the Hilbert scheme $\mbox{Hilb}_P$, parametrizing all subscheme in $\mathbb{P}^N$ with Hilbert polynomial $P$. Let $H$ be an irreducible component of $\mbox{Hilb}_P$ containing the point corresponding to $X$. Then, 1) Do all closed points in $H$ correspond to complete intersection subschemes in $\mathbb{P}^N$ with Hilbert polynomial $P$? 2) If a general element of $H$ correspond to a complete intersection subscheme in $\mathbb{P}^N$ with Hilbert polynomial $P$, then is there a positive answer to question $1$? 

Let $X$ be a smooth, projective variety and $D, E$ two effective divisors of $X$ which correspond to distinct elements on the cohomology group $H^2(X,\mathbb{Q})$. Denote by $H$ a very ample divisor on $X$. Is it then true that $H.D$ and $H.E$ correspond to distinct elements of $H^4(X,\mathbb{Q})$? If not true in general, is there any known condition on $X$ under which this holds true? EDIT: Assume that the underlying field is algebraically closed of characteristic zero and $\dim X \ge 3$. 

Let $X$ be an irreducible, reduced, projective curve over an algebraically closed field, with at worst nodes as singularities. Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a trivial vector bundle on $X$ of rank $r$. Consider a short exact sequence of the form $$0 \to \mathcal{F}' \to \mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{F}'' \to 0,$$ where $\mathcal{F}'$ and $\mathcal{F}''$ are coherent, torsion-free sheaves. What is the formula for $\chi(\mathcal{H}om(\mathcal{F}',\mathcal{F}''))$? Is there any reference for this? I know the answer to the question in the case $X$ is smooth. 

One has to note that in many countries there is a ministry that combines art and science. Clearly, society has decided that pure science research should be funded using taxpayer's money for similar reasons why art is funded. But funding research is only one way of promoting it. Another task of the government is to make sure that the public is educated well enough to be able to enjoy and benefit from the results of the research. Here most countries treat science and art differently. The educational program is quite minimalistic as far as science and math is concerned, you only learn what you need to know to get a job. If you want to learn more you need to study at university. We don't take this attitude when it comes to art or literature. This difference in attitude toward art and science explains why the beauty of math isn't as easily accessible to the wider public compared to the beauty of literature. But beyond not being able to appreciate the beauty of the subject, this has negative consequences for society. How can a democratic society choose what it should do to curb climate change if most people don't have enough scientific skills to separate expert opinion from nonsense? So, perhaps we are now paying the price of not having taken math as serious as other subjects.
