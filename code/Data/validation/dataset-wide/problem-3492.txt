EDIT: I just read in the Dynare user manual, that a first order taylor approximation of a DSGE model has "certainty equivalence", because future shocks drop out when you take the expectation operator. Yet current shocks do not drop out, as we can see in the following equation: 

The production set has a simple meaning: It is the set of all production vectors that are feasible to a firm. The production function also has a simple meaning: It gives the output quantity for a given vector of input quantities (for a firm that produces only one output. ) But what is the production transformation function? It is defined as the function $F(y)$ such that the production set is $\{y: F(y)\leq 0 \}$. Essentially, it is a way to encode the production set. But is there also a meaningful interpretation of this function itself, rather than merely as a mathematical device to define the production set in a way that's analytically tractable? 

In order for a DSGE model to have a unique solution, it is required to satisfy the Blanchard Kahn conditions. However, these conditions seem very abstract to me. Is there an intuition behind the blanchard kahn conditions? Why does a DSGE model have a unique solution iff the number of unstable eigenvalues at the linearized steady state is equal to the number of control variables? 

How do we solve for the initial consumption level in the Ramsey model? Assume we have the Euler equation $$\frac {\dot c_t}{c_t}=r_t-\rho$$ Then $$c_t=c_0e^{R_t-\rho t}$$ Putting this into the lifetime budget constraint: $$\int_0^\infty e^{-R_t}(w_t-c_t)dt=k_0$$ gives $$\int_0^\infty e^{-R_t}w_t dt-\frac {c_0} {\rho}=-k_0$$ Therefore $$c_0=\rho\left(\int_0^\infty e^{-R_t}w_t dt+k_0\right)$$ Where we know that $w_t=f(k_t)-k_t r_t$ and that $r_t=f'(k_t)$. However, the problem is that the initial amount of consumption will influence the path of $k_t$, because $\dot k_t=f(k)-c_t$, and therefore of $w_t$ and $r_t$ as well. Therefore it seems to me that solving for $c_0$ is almost impossible here. So let's say we would have a computer that could help us solve this, how would we do it? e.g. how does Dynare do it? 

So if this is a "certainty equivalent model", but we still have an exogenous shock, then what does certainty equivalence mean? Apparently it doesn't mean "the absence of uncertainty" since there is still an exogenous shock. 

The consumption elasticity of substitution (ES) is the ES between different consumption goods. The production ES is the ES between factors of production. My question is: are there any serious empirical studies of the numerical values of these elasticities, and if so, where can I find them? 

Afriat's theorem states that a set of price-consumption observations that satisfies GARP, can be rationalized by a concave increasing utility function. However, does this mean that GARP precludes being rationalized by a convex increasing utility function? Surely such observations can also be rationalized by a convex one? 

Suppose we have the following production function: $$F(L,K)=\max_{L_K}H(L,L_K,K)=\max_{L_K}\left[(L-L_K+1)^\alpha(L_K+K)^{1-\alpha}\right]=(L-L_K^*+1)^\alpha(L_K^*+K)^{1-\alpha}$$ With the constraint $L_K\in[0,L]$. We know that $$\frac {dH}{dL_K}=\alpha(L-L_K+1)^{-1}H+(1-\alpha)(L_K+K)^{-1}H=0$$ Hence the value for $L_K$ at which the derivative is zero is $L_K^0=\frac {(1-\alpha)(L+1)+\alpha K}{1-2\alpha}$. And the optimal value $L_K^*$ is: $$ L_K^*=\begin{cases} L_K^0 &\text{ if } &0<L_K<L &(1)\\ L&\text { if } &L<L_K^0&(2)\\ 0 &\text { if } &L_K^0<0 &(3) \end{cases} $$ It is clear that if $L_K^*\in(0,L)$, (case $(1)$ ), then the envelope theorem holds: $$\frac d {dL} F(L,K)=\frac \partial {\partial L}H(L,L_K^*,K)=\alpha(L-L_K^*+1)^{-1}\cdot F(L,K)$$ Moreover, in the third case (3), it is also clear to me that the envelope theorem holds. However, I am not so sure about the second case (2). I would say that the envelope theorem does not hold in this case, because if we substitute $L_K^*$ back into the original production function, we get $$F(L,K)=1^\alpha(L+K)^{1-\alpha}$$ And the derivative with respect to $L$ in this case is $$ (1-\alpha)(L+K)^{-1}\cdot F(L,K)$$ For the envelope theorem to hold in case 3, this would require $\alpha= (1-\alpha)(L+K)^{-1}$, which Almost-Always doesn't hold. 

Standard production functions are Cobb-Douglas, CES, Leontief. The most exotic production function I have seen is the Ethier production function. I am wondering whether there is a book/list of other exotic production functions. i.e. production functions with heterogeneous capital, integrals, etc. I could not find it doing a google scholar search. 

I have read technical books about the (baseline) RBC and New Keynesian models. However, these books tend not to explain very intuitively the propagation mechanisms of shocks between the two models, or the difference between them. I am referring to the mechanisms by which a shock to one variable affects the other variables. Since the baseline NK model does not contain any endogenous persistence, I'm primarily interested in how these effects play out within one time period. That is: what are all the mechanisms through which a shock propagates through the system and determines a new equilibrium $E^*$ (as opposed to the equilibrium $E$ that would have happened in that time period without the shock.) So I'm looking for an intuitive paper/article on the internal (propagation) mechanisms in RBC and New Keynesian models. Note again, that I am interested in a primarily intuitive/economic explanation of these mechanisms, rather than an overly mathematical one since the latter I have already found in textbooks. 

Intuitively, one might make a naive first guess that the production function of the economy, or of a firm, should be a "leontief" production function: "for example, you need both a factory and a worker to produce cars. A worker by himself, without the help of furnaces, and so forth, cannot construct a car, and the furnace by itself cannot do so either" Obviously, this argument does not mean that the production function has to be leontief, but intuitively this might be what one expects. I am looking for something written, that goes into great detail, on what the processes are behind the form of the production function (both firm-level and aggregate). Why would we expect a certain form of production function and not another? E.g. why would we expect a CES production function? why would the elasticity parameter be close to negative infinity, or to 0, or to 1? I hope that someone has written something that answers these questions on the basis of a micro level account (whether mathematical, or narrative). 

(GARP specifically assumes $p$ are price vectors and $x$ are consumption bundles, whereas the other two axioms apply to any type of choice structure.) 

At set intervals (or continuously) $t$ (which is the time duration after the creation of the option) during the lifetime of the derivative, the holder of the it is paid (or has to pay) an amount $x_t$ which depends on the value of the stock $S_t$ compared to a base-line value $S_0$. That is, for example $x_t=\ln(\frac {S_t} {S_0})$. (If something exists without this specific form that is fine too). The holder of the derivative/option can at any time that he wants, terminate it. 

I am looking for an analysis of the following exotic derivative: It is a kind of like a call option on a particular individual stock but with an extra element: 

Does an analysis of anything like this exist? I don't care whether it exists in reality, merely whether it has been analysed theoretically and maybe has a name. 

I know how to derive the transversality condition in simple models like the Ramsey model. However, I am looking to develop a deeper understanding of transversality conditions in more complex models. However most macroeconomics books I've seen only have about 1 page about the transversality condition, namely its simplest form. Is there a good book that shows how to deal with more complex trannversality conditions than the one in the ramsey model? e.g. if the utility function contains a term for assets? 

I keep reading about certainty equivalence in the context of DSGE models. I understand that it has something to do with "Getting rid of the expectation operator", but I'm not entirely sure? What exactly is "certainty equivalence" in the context of DSGE models? Do we have certainty equivalence if the solution to a stochastic model $M_S$ is the same as the solution to the non-stochastic model $M_N$, if $M_N$ is obtained by taking the equations of $M_S$ and simply removing the expectation operator and the random shocks? 

in the ramsey model, we use the no ponzi condition $$\lim_{t\to\infty}e^{-R_t}a_t\geq 0$$ for assets $a_t$ that a household holds at time $t$. I understand intuitively what the reasoning behind this is: the present value of the level of assets one holds in the "final period" (which goes to infinity), cannot be negative, because if it was, lenders would not be willing to borrow. However, I have ever only encountered this argument in vague terms like that. I have never seen a rigorous argument that the condition has exactly this form (rather than some other form such as $\lim_{t \to \infty}a_t\geq 0$, or $\lim_{t \to \infty}e^{-f(t)}a_t\geq 0$ for some other function $f$). In the Ramsey model, we have of course the equation of motion for capital, and while we can integrate this, and find something that looks like the no ponzi condition, we cannot actually derive the condition from it. It also seems to me that the no-ponzi condition is a bit ad-hoc, since we don't explicitly model lending and borrowing at all in the ramsey model. So is there a rigorous argument from first principles, based on the assumptions of the Ramsey model, that this is the condition we need, that doesn't rely on simply vaguely stating that "otherwise the household could borrow indefinitely"?
