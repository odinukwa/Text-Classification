I am an information security professional, my first thought at reading your story is: the data loss needs to be reported! Depending on what was on the USB stick (passwords, login credentials, confidential / classified documents, etc) your security department may need to take steps to correct the loss and prevent further damage to the company. For this reason, it's always best to report a data loss as soon as possible, ideally within a couple hours before hackers have a change to use the passwords, in the worst case. From a security perspective, not reporting the loss is actually the worst thing you can do, both for yourself, and for the company. 

If you will be going back to school in the fall, then you are highly unlikely to get offered a full time position. It just doesn't make any sense to hire you as a salaried employee (as opposed to being on a contract) when you'll be leaving in a few months. Even graduate students with 1+ degrees in programming still only get internships if it's temporary. What makes you think that an internship is any less 'real' than a 'standard employee'? In software, it takes 4 - 6 months for a new hire to get used to the codebase, that company's dev cycle, etc. For the first 4 - 6 months you're gonna be on a learning curve - and treated as such - whether you choose to call that an internship, or something else, doesn't change the experience. Rather than asking yourself "Do I have the knowledge to pass an interview test?", you should really be asking "Am I more skilled / have more experiences than other people who are applying?" You will likely be applying against people with college degrees / years of work experience, many of whom are happy to start with an internship. Is there a reason that you're a better candidate than them? 

If it were for a longer amount of time, say a few months, I'd include it. As it is, I'd leave it off, and then explain it at the interview ("Actually, no, Foocorp was not most recent job. I did a two week stint with BazInc after that. It ended so quickly that I felt it would be misleading to list them.") Past that, you try to be as honest as possible while emphasizing any positive aspects, the same as anything else in your job history. 

There is a potential downside to it, particularly if you put your resume out on a job site or farm it out into recruiters. Much like listing your phone number or email address, it gives people (possibly people well removed from those you originally submitted this to) the ability to contact you at will, and ties your name to that address, often in databases that will last a long time. That said, there are upsides to it. Although, as I commented to @jwenting above, I've never received anything via mail from a company until the offer the letter, and generally not even that these days, there probably are still companies out there that do such things. And, as jwenting points out, it does establish where you live, which may influence hiring decisions. Lastly, you may just run into anal-retentive HR people who insist that there must be an address and reject any resume that doesn't have one. Overall, I'd say it's a wash. The benefits are minor. The downsides are minor. 

I disagree with the answers saying it is a mistake to ask. I have sat on both sides of hiring panels, and my experience is that if you have an important question, it is usually much better to ask. Far from showing weakness, it shows confidence. Timid interviewees don't ask questions (perhaps out of fear of appearing weak?), which means that they sometimes don't know how to answer, may answer the wrong question, or even panic as their minds race and come up dry (I've seen it happen). It stunts the conversation and makes them appear less capable. Or, overconfident people also fail to ask questions, making themselves seem closed off to input and unteachable. Confident (but not overconfident) interviewees ask clarifying questions because they are comfortable in their own skin, and want to give the best answers possible. It starts a more satisfying conversation, and gives good (usually positive) insight. In fact, at the end of the interview, when they interviewer asks, "so, do you have any questions for us?," I always say, "yes," even if I don't. If nothing more, I just ask, "aside from what we've already talked about, what else can you tell me about the company / job / team / [whatever]?" And then I listen attentively and say it all sounds great. It builds a positive connection, makes you stand out, and gives them a chance to talk about something that's important to them. Also, it reveals things about the company you're considering working for. Your question is a good one. I would ask. 

That probably bears the caveat that you'll want to time your letter so that it shows up by your day of resignation and, if you're trying to avoid being removed from your job too early, you'll want to avoid them opening it too early. 

Within the United States, I'm pretty sure that there's no legal aspect to it. I have gotten bitten a few times by applying to a job which a recruiter had submitted me for (in one case, it was two different recruiters and in another, I knew the name of the company because I had the website up, but had no record of the recruiter contacting me, although I found an oblique email indicating that he had, alluding to a phone conversation). Most of the time, it's a mild embarrassment, like claiming to be pivotal on a project when talking to the guy who really headed it, but in one case, I missed out on a job because the owner of the company felt that my actions were unethical. Ultimately, it's largely a courtesy thing. The companies don't want to turn off recruiters from recruiting for them, but it's pretty much a matter of a job-by-job thing. Your safest route is to mention that Recruiter A from Company X had submitted you over two years ago for a different job, but that you found this one on your own. That way, if the company wants to avoid trouble, they can contact that recruiter. But honestly, over two years ago, and for a different job, especially if it's different divisions, there's really no conflict at all. I actually received my latest job that way. The former recruiter was bummed that they hadn't found the opportunity on their own, but accepted that it happened because they hadn't properly been on the ball. 

This example is wrong because you are apologizing first -- before you have even told them what you are apologizing for. It makes you look small and more worried about protecting your image than fixing the problem. Wrong message to send. Example (Right Way) 

I don't understand this power-struggle. You are proposing a large change to the workflow of your organization, but for some reason you are adopting this strange passive-aggressive stance where you refuse to help your colleague, and want your manager to brow-beat him into doing it your way, without any assistance from you, before you have even tried it. Sorry, I don't get this. 

Pivot the question from a weakness to a strength. "Because I finish what I start. I was very young when I started on my degree, and I took some breaks to travel, and to work and gain world experience. However over time I was determined to finish what I started. My course of study was very difficult, and has a very high drop out rate Nevertheless, I was determined to finish, and I am very proud that notwithstanding the difficulty of returning to study after an absence, I did and I excelled. "Additionally, my breaks to work bring a lot of value to potential employers. I bring maturity and work experience that other recent graduates do not have. I have learned the value of hard work, and have been exposed to several different work environments and management styles, and have learned how to work well with people from many backgrounds. "Also, my travels are a huge bonus. I used my travel time wisely to become fluent in several important languages. This gives me insight and skills that most recent graduates simply do not have. I know how to get along with people from many places, and can communicate with people from all over the region. "In short, I know that my breadth of work, travel and school experience bring an unusual amount of value to potential employers for a recent graduate, and I am excited to buckle down and work hard in this new chapter of my life." 

Since it doesn't seem to have been covered yet in the current answers, There is the possibility of the supervisor that you hand it to simply refusing to take it, or discarding it. If you think there's any risk of them "losing" your letter, you may want to take a second copy to Human Resources at your company, with an excuse of that you "thought they might want a copy too". Alternately, as Gnasher suggested in the comments: 

I don't see it as any more of an issue than the logos that staffing companies sometimes add to the top of your resume when they reformat it into their style. 

It's been said that it never hurts to ask. Of course, as with all absolute statements (including this one), there are exceptions. One of the first things to do is to check your paperwork. Did you sign a contract? Did the contract include a date by which you would begin work? If so, check for what stipulations there are for if such a date is not accomplished. Some contract boilerplate includes verbiage on what happens if the start date is pushed out or moved forward and some do not. If you feel it seems logical, ask the company. Perhaps they can start you on your training materials, or have you work on a concept necessary to the project on your own. If they balk, it may be worthy gently indicating that, if they are not willing to stand up to their side of the contract, there is nothing preventing you from pursuing other opportunities. Either way, a contract is a contract, and it applies to both sides. Unfortunately, this may result in having to bring in a lawyer if it's serious enough. If you haven't signed a contract, well, you might be able to argue a verbal contract, but your chances are bad. In that case, congratulations, you are a free agent. You have no obligation to begin work with them, so you can start interviewing again, and I'd honestly recommend that you do so, just in case you can't come to an agreement with them.
