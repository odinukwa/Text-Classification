Background Let $a,b,c,d$ be nonnegative constants and consider the map $T\colon [0,1]\times[0,1] \rightarrow [0,1]\times[0,1]$ defined by $$ T(x,y) := \left( \frac{1}{1 + ax + by}, \frac{1}{1 + cx + dy} \right), \quad (x,y) \in [0,1] \times [0,1]. $$ I'm interested in this map (and other similar ones) in the context of monotone dynamical systems. They come up, for instance, as the input to output characteristic of controlled dynamical systems with outputs modeling simple biochemical networks. Question By Brower Fixed Point Theorem, $T^2:= T \circ T$ has a fixed point. Now is this fixed point unique? If it is not unique, is there a counterexample? Are there reasonable hypotheses on $a,b,c,d$ which would guarantee that to be true? Of course I'm also interested in the general finite-dimensional case $$ T(x_1, \ldots, x_n) := \left( \frac{1}{1 + a_{11}x_1 + \cdots + a_{1n}x_n}, \ldots, \frac{1}{1 + a_{n1}x_1 + \cdots + a_{nn}x_n} \right), $$ as well as replacing the $1$'s in the numerator and denominator by general constants. But I'm hoping to find something conceptual in the simplest case which could then be applied in the general scenario. Progress (1) Computer simulations with randomly generated coefficients $a,b,c,d$ seem to indicate that this is true in arbitrary finite dimensions, with any nonnegative $a,b,c,d$. (2) If $a + c < 1$ and $b + d < 1$, then $T$ is a contraction (with respect to the sum-norm $|(x,y)| := |x| + |y|$. In particular, it has no period-2 points, and so $T^2$ has a unique equilibrium. But these hypotheses seem too restrictive. In fact, taking into consideration where $a,b,c,d$ come from, this is not always true. (3) This is also true if $b = c$ and $a = d = 0$. This makes me wonder whether there could be some sort of diagonalisation argument. Though I have no idea what to do with the nonlinearity. (4) I'm also attempting to approach this as a global optimization problem. More precisely, I'm looking at the map $$ (x,y) \longmapsto \|T^2(x,y) - (x,y)\|^2 $$ and tried to compute the Hessian using Maple but haven't gotten anywhere so far. 

$f(t, \cdot)$ is locally Lipschitz for every $t \geqslant 0$, for every compact $K \subseteq {\mathbb R}^n$ and every $b > a \geqslant 0$, $$ \int_a^b \|f(t,\cdot)\|_K\,dt < \infty\,, $$ where $$ \|f(t,\cdot)\|_K := \sup_{x \in K} |f(t,x)| + \sup_{\substack{x,y \in K \\ x \neq y}} \frac{|f(x) - f(y)|}{|x - y|}\,, $$ and there exist locally integrable $\alpha, \beta: [0, \infty) \rightarrow [0, \infty)$ such that $$|f(t,x)| \leqslant \alpha(t)|x| + \beta(t)$$ for every $(t,x) \in [0,\infty) \times {\mathbb R}^n$. 

Background Let $f: [0, \infty) \times {\mathbb R}^n \rightarrow {\mathbb R}^n$ be a jointly measurable function satisfying, 

We know that, under these hypotheses, the ordinary differential equation $$ x' = f(t,x) $$ generates a unique global flow $$ \varphi: [0,\infty) \times {\mathbb R}^n \rightarrow {\mathbb R}^n\,. $$ Question I'm wondering whether there is a canonical way of realizing $\varphi$ as the limit of globally defined maps $$ \varphi_k: [0,\infty) \times {\mathbb R}^n \rightarrow {\mathbb R}^n\,, \quad k \in {\mathbb N}\,. $$ Progress 

One may assume without loss of generality that $f(t,\cdot)$ is compactly supported uniformly in $t$; that is, there exists a compact $K \subseteq {\mathbb R}^n$ such that $f(t,x) = 0$ whenever $x \notin K$. Setting $\varphi_0(t,x) := x$, then $$ \varphi_k(t,x) := x + \int_0^t f(s, \varphi_{k-1}(s,x))\,ds\,, \quad k = 1, 2, 3, \ldots\,, $$ recursively, as in the standard proof of existence, doesn't seem to work. Euler's proof of existence seems to almost work. But the construction is not "canonical" in the sense that the subsequence along which convergence occurs via Arzela-Ascoli will depend on $f$. I would like to have a sequence $(\varphi_k)_{k \in {\mathbb N}}$ which could be defined by a procedure independent of $f$. This is because I'm ultimately interested in the flow of parametrized differential equations, and I don't want to have to choose a different subsequence for each parameter. 

I've been using the representation result below, from Krasnosel'skij/Lifshits/Sobolev; Positive Linear Systems---The Method of Positive Linear Operators. Heldermann Verlag, 1989. Theorem. Let $E$ be a real Banach space partially ordered by a solid, normal and minihedral cone $E_+$. Then there exist a compact Hausdorff space $Q$ and a linear homeomorphism $\Phi: E \rightarrow C(Q)$ such that $\Phi(E_+) = C_+(Q)$. In this statement, $C(Q)$ stands for the space of continuous, real-valued functions on $Q$, while $C_+(Q)$ consists of the nonnegative ones. This is stated as Theorem 6.6 on page 64 in the book. I'm wondering if anybody knows of a better presentation of this result. It's not the first time that I've been having problems with this book, which has many mistakes. The original paper of Kakutani from 1941 doesn't seem much easier to read, and Google searches haven't yielded much on that direction. Thanks! 

I think I got it! I turned out to be mistaken about item 2 in my Progress Notes. Lemma 1. Suppose $f \colon {\mathbb R}_{\geqslant 0} \rightarrow {\mathbb R}_{\geqslant 0}$ is locally integrable, and let $F\colon {\mathbb R}_{\geqslant 0} \rightarrow {\mathbb R}_{\geqslant 0}$ be the primitive given by $$ F(t) := \int_0^t f(s)\,ds\,, \quad t \geqslant 0\,. $$ For any positive integer $m$, set $f\colon {\mathbb R}_{\geqslant 0}^m \rightarrow {\mathbb R}_{\geqslant 0}$ by $$ f_m(t) := \prod_{i = 1}^m f(t_j)\,, \quad t = (t_1,\ldots,t_m) \in {\mathbb R}_{\geqslant 0}^m\,, $$ and set $$ S_m(T) := \{t \in {\mathbb R}_{\geqslant 0}^m\,;\ 0 \leqslant t_1 \leqslant \cdots \leqslant t_m \leqslant T\}\,, \quad T \geqslant 0\,. $$ Then $$ \int_{S_m(T)} f_m(t)\,dt = \frac{[F(T)]^m}{m!}\,, \quad \forall T \geqslant 0\,, \quad \forall m = 1, 2, 3, \ldots\,. $$ Proof. Follows by Fubini and integration by substitution. (Details/clarification upon request.) Assuming that $f(t,\cdot)$ is compactly supported uniformly in $t$ as described in item 1 of my Progress Notes, we may apply Lemma 1 to show that $(\varphi_k(\cdot,x))_{k \geqslant 0}$ is a Cauchy sequence on $[0,T]$ for each $T \geqslant 0$. Thus $$ \varphi(t,x) = \lim_{k \to \infty} \varphi_k(t,x)\,, \quad \forall (t,x) \in {\mathbb R}_{\geqslant 0} \times {\mathbb R}^n\,. $$ 

The motivation of your interest in finding the proof of the general first incompleteness theorem which does not 'naturally' (whatever you mean by that) imply the non-existence of finitely axiomatizable extensions of PA is unclear to me. For I would not overestimate the significance of the later (as long as you do not restrict yourself to the language of PA only, which seems unnecessarily restrictive to me). For if just one new unary predicate symbol is added to the language of PA, then the finitely axiomatized conservative extension of PA can already be constructed. This follows from the general result of Craig and Vaught extended from the one of Kleene. You can find the details and references here. 

Hi! Let G(N) be the number of graphs with vertices {1, 2, ..., N} and GN(F) be the number of those of them which satisfy graph property F. There is a beautiful result by Glebskii and Fagin that limit of GN(F)/G(N) can be only 0 or 1 for any first order graph property F. The proof essentialy uses compactness and Vaught's test. So, any first order property is either infinitely likely or infinitely unlikely for large graphs. Moreover, there is an algorithm which, given any first order graph property F as input, decides which of this possibilities holds for F (infinitely likely properties can be axiomatized by complete recursive first order theory). Questions. What about second order properties? More specificaly, what possibilities can be for probability of second order graph properties? Can we construct for any x from [0, 1] SO property with limit probability exactly x? What is the limit probability for connectedness of graph? Thanks for any answers and comments. 

Works by Montague show that natural language is not SO MUCH different from formal languages, its syntax and semantics has strong structure. You may say that they are semiformal. That is why we may apply all the techniques and results from mathematical logic, in which specificaly mathematical languages are formalized and deeply studied. As a result we have a field of formal theory of natural language and its aspects (grammar, semantics, development and so on). You may see the broad range of topics presented on this conference: $URL$ This opens the way for doing philosophy of language by formalizing the problems and answer them by mathematical proof. The work of Hilary Putnam presents attempts to tackle the problems of philosophy of mind and philosophy of language by comparing with formal models. To quote from his "Models and reality" paper: "In this paper I want to take up Skolem's arguments, not with the aim of refuting them, but with the aim of extending them in somewhat the direction he seemed to be indicating. It is not my claim that the "Lowenheim-Skolem paradox" is an antinomy in formal logic; but I shall argue that it is an antinomy, or something close to it, in philosophy of language. Moreover, I shall argue that the resolution of the antinomy - the only resolution that I myself can see as making sense - has profound implications for the greate metaphysical dispute about realism which has always been the central dispute in the philosophy of language." See his collected papers. Edward Zalta in his Principia Metaphysica has formalization of general notions of abstract and concrete objects. In mathematics (today) the most basic objects are sets. In Leibniz' Monadology (which is pure philosophical theory) they are monads. Zalta formalizes the monads and does Monadology formally. As well as Plato's theory of forms, theory of meinongian objects, theory of situations, the theory of worlds, theory of times. Moreover, Zalta claims that his formalization enables to obtain new useful abstract notions (objects) automaticaly by mechanized theorem proving. See his home page." 

Lindstrom's theorem states that any extension of FOL more expressible than FOL fails to have either compactness or Lowenheim-Skolem. When I first read Lindstrom's theorem my first reaction was: "Does it mean incompleteness of any more expressible extension of FOL? And why this obviously important question isn't discussed in standard logic texts?" Standard extensions (such as second order logic) in fact are incomplete. After some attempts of proving incompleteness I found reference to Vaught's paper in which he proves completeness of extension of FOL by adding quantifier Qx = "there are uncountably many x such that..." It would be very interesting (at least for me) to understand complete extensions in general. Such an extensions may be of great importance, for instance, for computer science, because FOL isn't enough expressive for its purposes. So, my questions are: 1) Do you know some other examples of complete FOL extensions? 2) Are there some results concerning characterization of complete FOL extensions? 2) Do you know any peoples, papers, books... studying general properties of FOL extensions? Thanks in advance. 

I am interested in different contexts in which Gödel's incompleteness theorems arise. Besides traditional Gödelian proof via arithmetization and formalization of liar paradox it may also be obtained from undecidability results of Turing and Church. In the context of complexity theory, it is not hard to see that Gödel's theorem (as well as Turing's result) follows from the following Chaitin's result: there exists some natural number N such that for any program P of size more than N it is impossible to prove (say, in ZFC) that it is the smallest (in the sense of size, i. e. number of bits) of those programs which have the same inputs-outputs as P has. The number N depends on particular axiomatic system (say, ZFC) and is not very large so that it actually can be calculated. If You know other ways towards Gödel's incompleteness theorems, please, present them. Particularly, can Goedel's theorem be obtained without use of self-referential ideas?
