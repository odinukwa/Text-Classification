I am not sure if this will answer your question, but it may at least point you in the right direction (or at least some direction). Let me start with some classical background. Let $C$ be a category with a class of weak equivalences $W$. Dwyer and Kan showed that this data presents an (∞,1)-category $C[W^{-1}]$, called the hammock localization. Like the classical Gabriel-Zisman localization, its 1-morphisms are equivalence classes of zig-zags of morphisms of $C$, but it also encodes the data of homotopies between these morphisms. From this perspective, the data of a model structure on $C$, with class of weak equivalences $W$, can be viewed as a computational tool whose purpose is to ensure that the mapping spaces of the hammock localization have a much more tractable description via taking resolutions in the Reedy model structure on simplicial objects in $C$ (at least under combinatorial and properness assumptions). Barwick and Kan have built on the work of Dwyer-Kan to show that the (∞,1)-category of pairs $(C,W)$, called relative categories, is in fact equivalent to the (∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-categories. Further, they have developed a model for (∞,n)-categories called relative n-categories. In the case n=2, if I understand correctly, a 2-relative category is the data of a tuple $(C, W, V_1, V_2)$, where $W$, $V_1$ and $V_2$ are subcategories of the category $Arr(C)$ of morphisms of $C$, subject to various axioms. This data should be thought of as two relative categories $(V_1, W)$, $(V_2, W)$, with an ambient category $Arr(C)$ encoding relations between them. See [C. Barwick, D. M. Kan, n-relative categories: a model for the homotopy theory of n-fold homotopy theories, pdf]. Now to your question. Since 2-relative categories present (∞,2)-categories, there is a mapping (∞,1)-category (instead of just a mapping (∞,0)-category = space) between any two objects. The story of relative categories and model categories suggests that there should be a notion of 2-model category, which is some additional structure on a 2-relative category, giving a simpler description of these mapping (∞,1)-categories. Presumably, this structure would be something like compatible model structures on the relative categories $(C,W)$, $(V_1,W)$ and $(V_2,W)$. In other words, I think it is reasonable that, in order for a given model category to be enriched over (∞,1)-categories, one should not ask for some property, but rather for some additional structure on it, along the lines of a 2-model structure. 

and was generalized to finite dimensional noetherian schemes in the same paper of Thomason. In the following paper the above results are extended to finite dimensional quasi-compact quasi-separated schemes. 

Yes. This is well-known and can be deduced, for example, from the general statements in the last section of this paper of Barwick. Take $V$ to be the symmetric monoidal model category of simplicial sets. Note that it is tractable because every object is cofibrant. By Corollary 3.33, the projective model structure on simplicial presheaves in $C$ is symmetric monoidal. Then by Theorem 3.36 the Cech-local projective model structure is simplicial, and by Theorem 3.38 it is symmetric monoidal. 

I have also wondered about this question and recently came across some papers that seem to answer it. First of all, the paper 

This gives a homotopy fibre sequence of connective spectra $K(X \text{ on } Z) \to K(X) \to K(U)$ where $Z \subset X$ is the closed complement of an open subscheme $U \subset X$. I am not sure in exactly what generality this proof works. The significance of working with infinity-categories is that the presheaf of infinity-categories $U \mapsto \mathrm{Perf}(U)$ satisfies descent, unlike its triangulated shadow. Etale descent Finally, let me mention that the question of etale descent is closely related to the Lichtenbaum-Quillen conjecture. This is now a theorem of Rost and Voevodsky and it implies that K-theory does satisfy etale descent in sufficient large degrees. The theorem of Trobaugh that Steven Landsburg mentioned, about etale descent for mod-$\ell$ Bousfield-localized K-theory, is in 

Toen proved that $RHom$ provides the internal hom in the homotopy category of dg-categories. For what you want to be true, you need something more than this: you need to know that $RHom$ is actually the right-derived functor of the strict internal hom $DG$. Apparently, this was proved in arXiv:1202.3359 (Prop. 5.2). On the other hand, if you are willing to work up to derived Morita equivalence instead of quasi-equivalence, then there is the paper [G. Tabuada, Homotopy theory of dg categories via localizing pairs and Drinfeld’s DG quotient, HHA, 12 (2010), no. 1, p. 187-219]. Tabuada constructs a model category of localization pairs, which is Quillen equivalent to the Morita model structure on dg-categories, and shows that it admits a right-derived internal hom functor which agrees with Toen's construction. 

The orbit category of an additive category $A$ with respect to an auto-equivalence $T : A \to A$ is the category whose objects are the same and whose morphism groups are given by $$ \mathrm{Hom}(X, Y) = \bigoplus_{i \in \mathbf{Z}} \mathrm{Hom}_A(X, F^i(Y)). $$ It is typically denoted $A/T$. The second reference discusses the symmetric monoidal case and will be more interesting for you. Since you mentioned something about it (though I am not sure I understand what you wrote), let me also mention that the projection functor $\pi : A \to A/T$ admits a right adjoint $\tau : A/T \to A$ which sends an object $X$ to the sum of all the $F^i(X)$ (assuming that $A$ admits infinite direct sums). 

Let $DGCat_k$ denote the $\infty$-category obtained by localizing the category of dg-categories at Morita equivalences. This is presented by the Morita model structure on the category of dg-categories. Recall that the fibrant objects are the idempotent complete dg-categories, or equivalently dg-categories for which the canonical functor $T \hookrightarrow D^c(T)$, into the dg-category of compact dg-modules, is an equivalence. Its dualizable objects are precisely the saturated dg-categories (Cisinski-Tabuada, Theorem 5.8). These correspond to schemes over $k$ which are smooth and proper. Let $A$ and $B$ be small dg-categories and consider To\"en's formula $$Fun_k(A,B) = D_{rqr}(A^{op} \otimes B)$$ for the internal hom in the $\infty$-category of dg-categories, where $D_{rqr}$ is the dg-category of right quasi-representable bimodules. If $A$ and $B$ are saturated, this reduces to an equivalence of dg-categories $$Fun_k(A,B) = D_c(A^{op} \otimes B)$$ where $D_c$ is the dg-category of compact dg-modules. If $A$ and $B$ are idempotent complete, and $A$ has the property of self-duality, then this gives an equivalence of dg-categories $$ Fun_k(A, B) = A \otimes B. $$ It is clear that this recovers the integral transform formula for perfect complexes, in the case of smooth proper $k$-schemes. This is only the small version of your question. In the presentable case all I can say at the moment is the following. If $A$ and $B$ are locally presentable dg-categories, compactly generated with $A_c$ and $B_c$ the full subcategories of compact objects, then $$ Fun^L_k(A,B) = Fun^L_k(\hat{A_c}, \hat{B_c}) = (A_c^{op} \otimes B_c)^{\wedge} = (A_c \otimes B_c)^{\wedge} $$ where the second equivalences uses Corollary 7.6 in To\"en's "Derived Morita theory". Here $(-)^\wedge$ denotes the free cocompletion, and I am assuming self-duality for $A$ again. This seems to recover the integral transform formula in the case of schemes, using $Perf(X \times_k Y) = Perf(X) \otimes Perf(Y)$. (It has been a while since I looked at this stuff, so let me know if I'm making a mistake somewhere.) 

or various other preprints of Alexander Rosenberg. Interestingly, the work of Rosenberg predates the above "no-go" results by about a decade. 

It makes sense to consider larger versions of the (unstable and stable) motivic homotopy categories built out of the site $Sch_S$ of all schemes over $S$ (say of finite type to avoid dealing with size issues). Denote the stable variant by $\underline{SH}(S)$; there is a fully faithful functor $SH(S) \hookrightarrow \underline{SH}(S)$ which identifies the usual motivic homotopy category as a right localization of the larger variant. One of the main pleasant features of the categories $SH(S)$ is that they satisfy the localization property (a theorem of Morel and Voevodsky) which means that for any closed immersion $i : Z \to S$ with open complement $j : U \to S$, the diagram $$ SH(Z) \xrightarrow{i_*} SH(X) \xrightarrow{j^*} SH(U) $$ is an "exact sequence" in the sense that $i_*$ is fully faithful and its essential image coincides with kernel of $j^*$. This property gives rise to the usual long exact localization sequences in motivic cohomology, algebraic cobordism, and so on. Further, the localization property is one of the main inputs into the existence of the formalism of Grothendieck's six operations on the categories $SH(S)$ (constructed by Voevodsky and Ayoub). For example, part of the formalism of six operations are the proper base change and projection formulas, and the localization property demonstrates these in the case of closed immersions. However, the larger categories $\underline{SH}(S)$ fail to satisfy the localization property. The problem is that when you work with the site $Sch_S$, you "automatically" get a functor $i_\sharp$, left adjoint to $i^*$, which satisfies base change against the operation $f^*$. By adjunction this means that $i^*$ satisfies base change against $f_*$. Using this, it is easy to see that the localization property cannot hold for $\underline{SH}(S)$ (see Remark 2.4.4 here). This failure can be interpreted as saying that the functor $j_*$ on $\underline{SH}(S)$ is "wrong" (that is, it does not agree with the usual $j_*$ under the embeddings $SH(S) \hookrightarrow \underline{SH}(S)$). One reason the construction $\underline{SH}(S)$ is interesting is that it can be used to define a cdh-local version of $SH$ (which cannot be done using the smooth site $Sm_S$, since you need non-smooth schemes to make sense of the cdh topology). Namely, let $\underline{SH}_{cdh}(S)$ denote the version of $\underline{SH}(S)$ formed with the cdh-topology instead of the Nisnevich topology; then let $SH_{cdh}(S)$ denote the full subcategory generated under colimits by (cdh-localizations of) smooth $S$-schemes. One can then prove that the canonical functor $SH(S) \to SH_{cdh}(S)$ is an equivalence ("motivic spectra have cdh-descent"). 

Your proof works in the derived case as well. That is, assume smoothness so that $D^bCoh$ is identified with the full subcategory of compact objects (in general the argument will apply to the subcategory of perfect complexes). Then every object $\mathcal{G}$ of $DQCoh$ can be written as a filtered homotopy colimit $colim \mathcal{G}_\alpha$ of objects of $D^bCoh$, as there is an equivalence of infinity-categories $DQCoh(X) = Ind(D^bCoh(X))$. If $F(G) = colim F(\mathcal{G}_\alpha)$ is compact, then you get $F(G) = F(G_\beta)$ for some $\beta$, and use conservativity of $F$ to conclude. 

This answer is an elaboration on Dylan's comments. 1) Let us define a homotopy theory to be a pair $(C, W)$, where $C$ is a category and $W$ is some class of morphisms called weak equivalences. (Let's say that $W$ satisfies some reasonable properties, e.g. it contains isomorphisms and is closed under composition.) Of course, the archetypal example is given by topological spaces with the class of weak homotopy equivalences, which are continuous maps that induce isomorphisms on homotopy groups. This is the homotopy theory that has been studied classically by algebraic topologists. Similarly we may consider the category of simplicial sets, again with the class of weak homotopy equivalences. Another classical example of a different flavour is given by the category of chain complexes of $R$-modules, for a commutative ring $R$, together with the class of quasi-isomorphisms (morphisms which induce isomorphisms on homology groups). This homotopy theory is also known as homological algebra. 2) Now, we would somehow like to express the idea that the homotopy theories of topological spaces and simplicial sets are equivalent, even though the categories themselves are far from being equivalent. That is, we would like to equip the category of homotopy theories itself with a class of weak equivalences (I'm going to ignore size issues here). One idea is to consider Gabriel-Zisman localization: given any homotopy theory $(C, W)$, there is a canonical construction $C[W^{-1}]$ which universally inverts all morphisms in $W$. Thus we could say that an equivalence of homotopy theories is an equivalence of the associated Gabriel-Zisman localizations. The homotopy theories of topological spaces and simplicial sets will then be equivalent in this sense, according to a theorem of Milnor. The downside of this definition is that any homotopy theory $(C,W)$ will be indistinguishable from the homotopy theory $(C[W^{-1}], isos)$ (where we take weak equivalences to be isomorphisms). Experience has taught us that is not what we want: the construction $C[W^{-1}]$ is poorly behaved from the homotopical point of view, as it is not even possible for instance to recover homotopy (co)limits from $C[W^{-1}]$, while ideally we would expect that any homotopy theory should have an internal notion of homotopy (co)limits. Instead, one should use a much more refined version of the construction $C[W^{-1}]$, namely the $(\infty,1)$-categorical localization; it can be modelled for example by the Dwyer-Kan localization of simplicially enriched categories. This gives a good notion of weak equivalence of homotopy theories. We then have a striking theorem of Clark Barwick and Dan Kan that can be paraphrased as follows: 

See section 4.2, where he proves that for a pre-triangulated dg-category, its dg-nerve is a stable $\infty$-category. Here dg-nerve means either the construction you described (applying Dold-Kan and then the simplicial nerve) or a construction from Lurie's Higher algebra that associates directly an $\infty$-category to a dg-category; the above paper shows that both constructions are equivalent. The author does not address explicitly the converse statement, that if the dg-nerve is stable then the dg-category is pre-triangulated, but I would expect it to be true as well. 

Nisnevich descent for perfect complexes, as a prestack of stable infinity-categories $X \mapsto Perf(X)$. Compact generation of $D(X)$ by the perfect complexes, and also for the version "with support" on a closed subscheme $Z \subset X$, i.e. for the full subcategory $D_Z(X)$ of complexes that vanish on $X-Z$.

Abstract: Derived categories of singularities measure how far is an algebraic variety from being smooth. They appear on the algebraic side of the Homological Mirror Symmetry (HMS) for the Landau-Ginzburg models. The talk will be dedicated to the case when the superpotential is given by the so called invertible polynomial. In the case of small dimensions, I will give the description of mentioned categories in terms of full strongly exceptional collections of good kind. I will also recall several conjectures concerning HMS for the current case and will show how the constructed collections help to assert 

and is also generalized in the paper of Rosenschon and Ostvær. [Edit] Sketch of a proof, part 2 Let me give more details on the proof, now that I understand the details a little better. The main ingredients are 

The functor $\Sigma$ admits an ind-adjoint if and only if it is left exact (SGA 4, Exp. I, 8.11.4). Every short exact sequence in a semisimple abelian category splits, and $\Sigma$ commutes with finite direct sums (since it is by assumption $F$-linear), so the conclusion follows. 

Let $sSet$ be the category of simplicial sets with the Quillen model structure. Define a homotopy monomorphism in $sSet$ to be a morphism whose homotopy fibres are empty or weakly contractible. In a model category $C$, define a homotopy monomorphism $f : x \to y$ to be a morphism such that $f_* : Map(z,x) \to Map(z,y)$ is a homotopy monomorphism in $sSet$ for each object $z$. Then it is easy to show that $f : x \to y$ is a homotopy monomorphism if and only if the diagonal $x \to x \times^h_y x$ is a weak equivalence. Indeed one reduces to the case $C = sSet$ easily. Then one can assume that $f$ is a Kan fibration between Kan complexes, so that this homotopy fibred product can be replaced by the ordinary fibred product $x \times_y x$. Similarly the homotopy fibres of $f$ can be replaced by ordinary fibres. Then the claim is clear. Finally note that the above definition of homotopy monomorphism in $sSet$ is equivalent to the definition you wrote using homotopy groups: this follows directly by looking at the long exact sequence on homotopy groups.
