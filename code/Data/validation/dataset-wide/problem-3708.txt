Dehydration has a negative effect on metabolic rate in skeletal muscular metabolism in that it hinders metabolic efficiency with strain and heat. See this link for the full article. And this one for a research publication. 

Conclusion: Bone minerilaztion/density increases with any stress placed on the bone including working out. Human Growth Hormone (HGH) and other hormones will help to facilitate this as long as there is simulation by mechanotransduction. Osteocytes are the cells responsible for this and have an average lifespan of 30 years so bone minerilaztion will decrease with age. Bone size can and will increase as well. This is heavily dependent on Human Growth Hormone levels that increase with high intensity and anaerobic workouts. Overall, HGH decreases with age without HGH treatment. In women post menopause, bone density nor size will not increase due to reduction of various hormone levels, however, this too can be mitigated by HGH treatment and hormone therapy but with possible side effects. 

In short, YES! The goals you mention of building muscle and burning fat are not mutually exclusive, biologically speaking if that is what you are asking. So in short yes your workout schedule can be effective but it may be a better strategy to prevent injury and maximize gains by having a rest period between weight days. Example: Mon: HIIT Tue: Weights Wed: Rest Thurs: HIIT Fri: Weights You know your schedule better that anyone but HIIT can also serve as a rest day for weight training so you could do HIIT on Wednesday and weights on Thursday. Just make sure that if your still very sore from your last wight day that you at least change up the workouts a bit to prevent injury. Also, just how effective it is depends on a number of factors: - Diet - Intensity & Sets/Reps - Rest - Defining HIIT The part that may be somewhat exclusive is the type of diet you adopt to target your specific goals. Diet: As far as fat loss is concerned, diet play a very important role. Speaking generally, you'll need a diet that is lower in carbohydrates than the standard 65-75% macros that the USDA and WHO recommend (1,2) Recent studies have shown greater success with low carb vs low fat diets for reducing body fat and improving overall health. (3,4) How low you go on your carb intake depends on how much weight you want to lose and whether that or muscle gains are more important to you at the moment. Lowering carb intake will lead to better/easier results in fat loss but the tradeoff is that it will may negatively affect performance. In low carb diets protein synthesis can still work just as efficiently but maximum effort may be compromised. As such many people employ different strategies such as carb-cycling (5) to keep body fat as low as possible and performance high. Others have achieved slower but steady gains with diets such as the ketogenic diet. You'll have to find what works best for you but overall I'd suggest that you moderate your carb intake to achieve the best mix of muscle growth and fit appearance. In either case, you will also want to increase your protein intake too, assuming you haven't already. The DRI (Dietary Reference Intake) is 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight, or 0.36 grams per pound. (6) While this meager amount is enough for a coma patient to prevent short term deficiency, most nutritionists advocate for at least .07 - 1 gram of protein per pound of lean mass for moderately to very active individuals. (7) Personally, I don't advocate for protein supplementation when you can get all the protein nutrients you need plus other nutrients from healthy and nutrient dense foods like fish, eggs, and, my favorite, steak. However, there is some research indicating that BCAA's can really help improve muscle recovery. Intensity & Sets/Reps: Strength and HIIT are great to use in conjunction to lower fat and increase strength. For anaerobic workouts the intensity of the lift is relative to one's skeletal muscular strength. This is why it is measured by lifting retaliative to x% of one's one Repetition Maximum (1RM). The higher the percentage, the higher the microtears to muscle and the greater the gains. Generally this is at 70-90% of 1RM. High percentage puts an extreme amount of strain and pressure on one's body. This chart may vary for some but it gets you in the ballpark. 

Most gyms have personal trainers for hire. They'll know the lay of the land and what equipment you can use to achieve your goals. Typically they want you to sign up for a contract of several (6-12) sessions, but you can usually make it clear you just want someone to set-up a routine for you and not be your new workout buddy. 

The challenge of measuring "fitness" is that is a vague concept. If you want to take specific measurements, you need specific goals. As an example of vague to specific: 

I tried method #1 when I first started climbing and saw some modest improvements. Then I read some books on technique (Internet resources on climbing we're as plentiful then) and hung out with a guy who'd been climbing for a few years. My technique improved a touch and suddenly I was able to last a lot longer. 

Flat, non-compressible soles work best for weight-lifting. Chuck Taylors are better than any running shoe. If that isn't trendy enough for you, something like the Vibram FiveFingers or other "free" running shoe will work. As for what the other people in the gym are doing, that's a terrible gauge for proper behavior. It'd be like learning to drive by watching cab drivers. 

Yes, but depending on your goals (i.e. strength gains versus endurance) it may make more sense to add extra weight. Edit: If your goal is to burn a specific number of calories, increasing weight or reps won't provide any benefit. If the goal is increase strength, size, power, or endurance doing more work than normal will get you closer to overload where the micro trauma occurs that allows for muscle growth (assuming your diet and rest periods will accommodate the growth). The proper balance of weight versus reps depends on which type of muscle fibers (i.e. slow twitch, fast twitch A, or fast twitch B) you want to encourage. 

Pick up your weight just a few inches off the ground and pause for a few seconds. This will have the effect of forcing your body to be in the right position and help strengthen your supporting muscles (the Synergists and Fixators) and thereby help you maintain proper form as you progress in weight, but don't do these with a lot of weight. Lastly, if you increase the strength and flexibility hamstrings, along with the all the other muscles involved, this will improve your control over your form. See Deadlift anatomy illistration: [ Also the antagonist muscles are helpful in controlling the weight as you come back down. If you struggle with maintaining proper form and controlling the weight coming down then also consider strengthening the antagonists. More on proper lifting techniques: $URL$ 

In short, for the question of preventing injury, it's entirely relative to one's current fitness, nutrition, age, and current physical status. There is never a guarantee that stretching and warming up will prevent injury. The point of warming up is to limit the likelihood. For example: if one in relatively good shape and is relatively young and have no physical limitation such as a leg cramp, then in the cases you mentioned the risk of injury, in exercising with out warm-up, is relatively low. Conversely, in the other extreme, if one is relatively old, over weight, never works out, eats unhealthy, and currently has a leg cramp, then injury would be highly likely to occur. In both cases, however, injury is neither guaranteed to occur or not occur. Sorry the answer is not definite but in this case one cannot speak in absolutes. That said, Yes, it would be helpful in preventing injury to increase your fitness in a given activity in spontaneous things like running short distances before engaging in them to better condition your body. Spontaneous efforts will, at first, engage the fast twitch muscles so you'll also want to add a strength training regiment. Strength training will benefit you most for explosive efforts. If your ultimate goal is simply to do it with less hard breathing and sweating then cardio/pulmonary workouts [i.e. exercises that strengthen the lungs and heart] can increase lung and heart efficiency. Strength training is great for your heart but does little for lung endurance. This is where HIIT may become useful. As for sweating though, arguably, if you have to exert less efforts to receive same benefit then your body will need to sweat less but, at the same time, the more fit you are, the more easily you will sweat. See this article.. Other factors come into play as well such as ambient temperature, hydration, etc. For the issue of sweating, you can wear clothes that well breathe well and dissipate the sweat. HIIT is great for the lungs and heart but it is not a replacement for strength training and will not produce the same results in the short term or even long term. HIIT is the perfect method for losing fat while retaining muscle mass. It is also a good way to train for spontaneous activities especially if you also desire to burn calories. Some people define HIIT differently, so I'll add this qualifier Weight training being -i.e. weighted squats, leg press, calf extensions, lunges, etc. and HIT being non-weighted High Intensity Workouts. Some HIIT techniques involve weighted exercise but they're applied with a different methodology. The focus with HIIT is to burn calories not to build muscle strength. One of the drawbacks of HIIT is that many of it's activities may put you at risk of injury. If you're concerned about injury or have had a recent injury, I wouldn't recommend HIIT. More on why HIIT is not a replacement for strength training: 

The bullet point list of items you are asking for are at odds with one another and you need to recognize this and adjust either your goals or what you're willing to take on in order to achieve them. Example: You want to continue your current diet AND lose enough body fat to be able to see your abdominals AND work out less than 90 minutes/day. If you are currently 180lbs with a gut, you are most likely genetically predispositioned to carry fat around your abdomin so you'll need to hit single digits in body fat percentage. That doesn't come without serious dieting, extreme amounts of time working out, or both. 

It is important to note that in and of itself lifting weights will not cause you to gain weight. You gain weight by eating more than you need. Exercise will change your body composition (fat->muscle). It sounds like you have both going on. 

Among other things, sleep deprevation will effect metabolism, glucose response, and hormone production. If you have severely reduced sleep (less than 4 hours per night) your hormones will be insufficient to recover from stressful weight training and your stored glucose levels will be too low for significant endurance training (>60 minutes). You can train under these conditions, but you will need to seriously restrict your activities to avoid doing more harm than good. Aim for maintenance rather than improvement in body composition and keep sessions short (30 minutes). I work with first time fathers through the hospital and exercise is the third thing that drops off after baby comes (sex is first, night out with the guys is the second). I usually recommend that both parents find a social sport they can participate in once or twice a week (tennis, basketball, softball) as a way of retaining some balance. I don't present on infant sleep or parenting technique so I'll keep my opinions to myself there. 

Most likely if you're able to do 300 a day then the answer is YES, probably, but NOT significantly, it isn't build any significant mass. If your able to do 300 push ups then, for your body weight / strength ratio, it's more than likely below 15% of your 1RM in say bench press. Therefore, this activity is best described as an aerobic or endurance training without adding much in strength or mass. When you go beyond >15% of your 1RM then there is little measurable increase. With the traditional Push up, you're lifting around 65% of your body weight. I assume that if you're doing 300 that you're probably doing 50-75+ in each set. There has bee considerable amount of research on this subject. This article explains it very well. In order to build mass you need to be lifting at a higher weight / lower rep ratio. With extreme of the bulk building exercise philosophy, typically this means lifting weights that are around 85%-95% of your 1RM with a lot of sets resting around 2-3 min between and targeting around a maximum of 6 in each set. You could adjust it to as low as 50% of your 1RM, though there may be some, there wouldn't be much of an increase in mass. 

Lactic Acid: The burning soreness that people refer to is caused by lactic acid buildup as a byproduct of ATP energy breakdown in the muscle cells. The circulatory system cleans the acid out as quickly as it can but just because lactic acid is no longer present, it doesn't necessarily mean that the muscle has recovered. Strength or Anaerobic: Soreness can also be caused by micro tears in the muscle fiber, affectionately referred to as ripping by body builders. These micro tears are also called Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS). For people accustomed to lifting, they might not notice this as much as others by the time the lactic acid has been cleared out. For people who are new to exercise, on the other hand, they may find it hard to tell the difference between lactic acid, muscle tears, or even crams and spasms. Age is also a factor to consider with DOMS and muscle recovery. Quote From this article: 

Cooking (whether baking, frying, grilling, or using a microwave) has a nominal effect on the nutritional value of foods. Using the uncooked data for calculating the post frying impact is fine. 

The Nike Free 5.0 was one of the first running shoes designed to simulate barefoot running. The "5.0" was supposed to indicate that it was half way between running with a traditional shoe (10.0) and running barefoot (0.0). You might find the 3.0 to be good for regular running. There are lots of minimalist running shoes you just need to decide what it is that you really want. 

Heart rate monitors are almost always more accurate than the readings on cardio machines. Even cardio machines that can pick-up your heart rate don't usually have enough information (e.g. resting heart rate) to do the proper calculations. 

Your hands are doing very little during a push-up. So while you might feel some force there, don't be concerned by it. Many chest exercises (except the previously mentioned fly) use a combination of chest and tricep muscles. If all you want is a large chest, the bench press is one of the best exercises you can do. Shoot for 1.5x your body weight. If, however, you're developing your chest for strength in a particular activity, find an exercise that mimicks the activity and use it as your basis. 

Aside from the already mentioned Crossfit, I'd recommend reading up with my personal favorite Home Workout Bible. It has good exercises and routines for a variety of goals and differing available equipment. Cooking as a student is hard. You might want to look at something like Zonya's which focuses on healthy, quick to prepare meals. Most are scaled for four people, but you can get some down to one or two portions. She also includes useful nutrional information so you can use it to make plans about what you should be eating, not just what sounds good.
