So are you wanting to imply that when you use your graphic design skills the company will think of this as free labor? Seriously? You get paid a wage and part of that is to bring whatever skills you have that the company can use. Do you think many places would let you specify getting paid $x/hour for administrative tasks, $y/hour for programming tasks, and $z/hour for graphic design tasks? I don't know of many places that would work that way as then wouldn't the administrative stuff get the lowest pay since anyone could do that stuff like e-mail and phone calls and regular meetings that aren't using any technical skills? Some developers wear many hats. I know when I was in my early years of development, I did some technical support, system administration, database administration, network administration in addition to building new systems. This is part of the job, that you'll have the opportunity to do this and that. If you want something more specialized then consider finding companies where your work is sliced so thinly that you only get to do one part of things which would tend to be the bigger companies where the processes are mature and each person takes on a specific role. 

Feel not only comfortable talking about projects you've worked on but exhibit a bit of passion for it. We've all seen where you start talking to someone about something they are interested in and there is a bit of a spark. Have projects you are working on outside an academic setting. It might be open source software or Arduino or Raspberry Pi or whatever... have a technical hobby project you are working on. There is nothing wrong with not knowing something, but know and be able to explain how you'd learn about it. Be friendly and polite. It should not require being stated, but there have been so many interviews where this was not the case... so many... 

With this said, being self-taught in tools puts you above your peers in your graduation class that didn't better themselves similarly (most of them for sure). Being self taught is certainly a strength as it shows you want to go above and beyond the minimum. This in itself demonstrates three of the key differentiators I listed above. 

My suggestion would be to consider answering in a way that gives flow to a conversation. Thus, if you answer, "Yes, next question please," that may be a way to move things along rather than just saying, "Yes," which may be seen as part of an answer rather than the full answer. While you may answer the question, you don't want to be ending the conversation with your answer, do you? That could be where this is perceived as they may not see this as the full answer that you do, particularly if this is on the phone. There is also the potential for something else be updated or answers written down that may take a little time, so do consider the idea of what is the other person doing at that point which could mean you asking a question or two here. 

No, I disagree here strongly. When I was in university, I changed programs from Co-op to regular, changed my majors to being a double of Combinatorics & Optimization and Computer Science instead of just Computer Science, and changed which 4th year courses I took more than a few times so that while I could speculate what I'd take in my first and second year, the reality turned out differently so my resume did change as I went through the program. I'd only put down courses after I had taken them as I didn't see great value in putting on my resume that I'd take a course in Algorithm Design and Analysis 3 years from now. There is something to be said for the differences that can happen as one goes through a program as I entered the University of Waterloo wanting to have a Co-op Honors Bachelor of Mathematics with major in Computer Science and ended up with a Combined Double Honors Bachelor of Mathematics with majors in Combinatorics & Optimization and Computer Science. 

Be eager and proactive in asking what additional work duties you can take on Do not get idle. If you are not given tasks to replace the ones you automate, find ones that benefit the company and yourself (in that order). 

Never make yourself indispensable. Doing so means it is isn't possible to move up or onto something different. If you can automate much of your job, you should. You can almost never have too many people that make things more reliable and lessen maintenance. These people pay for themselves over and over. Automating tedious parts of your job leave you available for more interesting tasks. Automating work saves the company money year over year for a one time expenditure. Obviously, there is a variable return on the investment, but in general, it's better to automate. People that take initiative in solving their work problems are not that common. Most people follow the motions and work within set parameters. These people are easily replaced and add minimal value. 

Unless your desired job is in HR, I question the useful of this approach. If you want to work in the IT department for example, the chances of an HR recommendation being useful could well be quite low as a development manager may think, "What the heck does HR know about what we really do here?" Consider what would be the point of that referral or e-mail going to HR. Is it to get the meeting you could get otherwise? Is it to find out if the company is hiring? The reason I have the qualifier there is that if you do work in HR then it may well be worthwhile to have connections in the desired department you want to work. 

My suggestion here would be to have a consultation meeting where you'll ask for a problem and then provide various suggestions as an example of your skills. Now, this may not always be practical but it could be a way to start a relationship so that someone gets a taste of your work and knows what it looks like. So, this may mean that the first meeting is where you get some information and schedule a follow-up to show some results and see what you have. At other times, there may be ideas during the meeting you can give if you think fast enough. 

Now I know that many of the problems I have stated here are borderline assumptions( Although I have talked to various people in the firm and done my own research before forming my own opinions). And I very well maybe in for a surprise and absolutely love it there. That is a possibility and I will join the place with an open mind, BUT I do want to go into the work environment prepared for the kind of problems I most probably face, and make sure that my time spent there is productive. I know many people who would suggest against joining a company I am not very fond of, but this is a compromise that I am making, for the financial well being of my family, and a choice that I am making independently and with a certain degree of comfort. So my main questions regarding the same are: 

How do I make the most of a job working with slightly aged technologies? How do I make a place for myself, and prove myself to be useful (or even make myself standout) at an organization having thousands of employees? How do I make sure that I learn a lot and advance my career even if the scope of the same might be limited? How do I attain a certain degree of job satisfaction despite the job-profile not being the one I had hoped for? 

The "other candidates" mentioned likely fell through and they couldn't retain them. This is a very common occurrence. If there is nothing else that caused you concerns, I would not worry too much. However, two full days of interviewing seems questionable. 

Check any company handbooks or anything you've signed to see if you might be violating a contract by leaving for a competitor. Even if it is a violation, it is not commonly pursued and less commonly upheld depending on your locale. Get a written offer from the other company Accept other offer and provide the appropriate start date based on traditional notice periods (2 weeks is common in the U.S.) Create a resignation notice and provide it to your employer Since you seem to like and respect the manager, make sure you let them know before they hear it from someone else. Make sure you let them know it isn't personal and it is simply a great opportunity. Keep it positive and if the broken promise of management is brought up, simply say that was one of the things that attracted you to that position. 

Could you consider what kind of job title would you want to have in 5 years? Could you consider what specialties would you have in 5 years? For example, would you want to get more into mobile development? Back-end web services? Building better interfaces for various big data systems? The key here is to consider how well could you give an idea of where you want to be going that aligns with where you could fit into what the company would need down the road as part of the point of the question is to consider what kind of future do you see, how do you feel about it and how would you make it work. Also, consider if you'd want to be mentoring junior developers, writing standards, getting into architecture, etc. as other parts of what you may or may not want to be doing in future roles here as something else to consider. 

Second, with this set of criteria you can now go and interview various places and I'd be tempted to point out that while there may not be any opportunities right now that are a fit, you want to communicate what you want and to be kept in mind if something comes up. This could be interesting to see who would meet and discuss things as you may run into something like, "That's not how we do things here," which would be a way to weed out those places that aren't necessarily after the long-term beneficial relationship. There will likely be some issues to resolve as well as more than some time spent making sure you know what you want here. 

You should not provide your username and password and reply back explaining that the security policy prevents you from providing that information and this sounds like a phishing email; CC an internal security team or IT team to make them aware of the email going around. If it's a legit request and they press the issue further, approach them in-person to discuss and explain why you shouldn't. If they still insist, provide it in-person and not over email. 

Contracts ending are normal in software development. I see many resumes each week with a bunch of three to twelve month employment stints; perfectly normal if the person was a contractor. So, I don't think you should worry about the "only nine months long and not a long-term engagement" part. If asked about the contract, focus on the technology. If they ask about the project in non-technical terms, tell them there were some challenges, what the challenges were (without being too critical), how you/the team overcame them, what you learned, and explain how it made you better at your job. Do not speak ill of the employer or the other employees. It just makes you look bad.
