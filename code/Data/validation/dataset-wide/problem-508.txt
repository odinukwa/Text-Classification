The linked article is a bit more of a rant than anything scientific. High end $5000 bikes, especially road bikes, are not built to last - they are built light to go fast and trade durability to do so. A frame does not make a bike - in fact on a $5000 bike, a new frame will cost maybe $1000 - hurts and expensive, yes, far from a write off. Buyers of $5000 bikes understand this. Mid-range bikes are less likely to suffer the same problems as people tend to keep them longer and expect them to last. These bikes are mass produced in high volumes - so plenty of spare parts are manufactured, and held in stock. One way to save money as a manufacturer is not hold spare parts, so cheap bikes tend to have parts problems as well but these bikes are rarely worth the labour cost for a repair anyway. Parts compatibility and vendor lock-in are not a problem in the cycling world, it was an effective monopoly for so long, and is still a duopoly, all parts are relatively interchangeable. The main mounting points etc on frames are all standardized (there is often more than one standard, so getting the right parts is important). If you search other posts asking similar questions you will see my personal opinion is that upgrading a bike over time is a very expensive proposition and never gives a good bike for the outlay. Parts are expensive to the extent that it is no uncommon to buy a new donor bike to upgrade a frame, rather than buy individual parts - purely because it is much cheaper. Best option is buy the bike you can afford today, and live with it till you can buy a better one. Buy a better quality used bike, of even better, last years model on 50% discount (The main difference is usually colour) rather than pay sticker price for this years model. To alleviate your fears about parts availability, stick to big brands, stay away from chain stores, and consider a bike is a collection of distinct, easily replaced parts - unlike say a car. 

Unlike car disk brakes, there is not a lot of spare "meat" on bicycle rotors. "Machining" the rotors is not really feasible. If they are worn to the point grooves are causing performance issues, the rotors should be replaced. Sanding them down evenly (without expensive machining tools) will be next to impossible to remove scoring and maintain a uniform rotor thickness. It is likely to cause pulsating or even the brakes to grab or lock up. A light sanding probably will not hurt, but is unlikely to make any significant difference. 

On high humidity days, the air has less mass due to the more H2O, which is lighter than typical O2, CO2 and N2 weights. On high pressure days there is more mass for you to push aside. Air temperature also plays a part - hot air is less dense than cold air. Therefore a hot, low pressure, high humidity day requires less mass to be pushed aside. These make a measurable difference to aircraft, however I have no idea if a cyclist travels fast enough for it to be measurable. I believe its more likely imperceptible wind and your own well being (or lack there of) 

If the brake lever is integrated with the shiftier, you will need a new shifter. Cable run for Hydraulic will be continuous, and you wont have C-Clip mounts. You will need to use zip ties to hold the cable to the frame. Functionally there is no problem with this, how you feel about this depends entirely on if you prefer form or function. MTB Caliper mounts have been standard for 15 years or so (Road has a different standard introduced by shimano in 2010 ). In most cases you will be able to unbolt the mechanical calipers and bolt on the new ones, however some calipers are aimed as a different minimum rotor size. This means you may need a new adapter depending what you have and what you get. As long as the new caliper minimum rotor size is not larger than the rotor you have, you can get an adapter to fit. I would think about installing new rotors (although $$ is a consideration). The old brakes were not expensive, so the rotor won't be the best quality, new rotor would keep everything matching. It may make no difference but might help with longevity and reliability (e.g. if they are warped). 

The bike was built as a racer and it looks you are trying to make it into a hybrid/Commuter and get a more relaxed riding position. This wont work as the geometry is wrong for that. Have you tried with the seat more horizontal. As it is, it will push you forward. Its also as far forward as it will go - slide if back on its rails. At the same time raise the seat height and/or lower the handlebars - normally a road bike the seat is higher than the bars. If this does not work drop bars might help as would a longer stem. 

There are many factors that influence choices. - terrain you ride, sunlight intensity, shade effects etc, and personal preference. A quick internet search will give you technical answers on what colors do look here . For me personally, I mostly Mountain Bike, I live in New Zealand, which has extremely high UV light levels. Therefore I do not venture out for more than an hour without some protection. I will use different glasses for different rides, but only because I have them. For use while riding, the all rounder is Yellow, for other things as well, I would head towards amber. If correct color perception is important, then you will struggle to get glass that work as well as Yellows/Amber's - especially in low light. The advantage of the blue filters (blue blockers) is they lift depth perception and contrast - maybe roadies don't need it, but off road MTB it is a definite advantage. Clear - I use these where protection from things other than sunlight is desirable (insects, sticks, dust etc), and maximum use of available light essential - mostly night riding. Yellow - I use these a majority of my riding. Do a great job at smoothing the transition from shade to full sunlight (i.e. I can see into dark forest from bright sunlight). On bright days, let too much light in for comfort (But still protect from damaging UV). Mine are specific sports style - not really a fashion accessory.... Amber - Similar to yellow, but filter more light, making the shade a bit darker. Probably my most versatile sun glasses - use them when the yellows will look dorky -rides with family, beached etc. Blue/polarised - Better color perception so I use the driving, fishing and general wear. Mine are pretty much towards the "fashion" end of the style range, not good for riding - too dark for forests. 

Looking at the component specs, its an entry level MTB, one better than a BSO. 80% of mountain biking is about the rider and his skills, not the bike. Shops won't tell you this, as telling you your riding skills matter most does not end in a sale of a newer season/more expensive bike. Cashed up middle aged execs won't either - many just want you to see how much money they have to spend on toys and cannot ride to save themselves - a lighter/faster/more forgiving bike hides the lack of skill. Competitive riders care what they ride - they have expensive bikes because 1/2 a second here and there makes a difference to them. Where it will let you down is weight (Makes it harder to accelerate and not as fast up hills), front forks (Likely to have poor rebound control and bounce a lot - pogo sticks) and gear shifts will not be fast and crisp. Picking the right gears early will be critical to having fun, as will picking good lines in corners. The forks mean you will not have room for cornering mistakes and will probably have to enter corners slower than other. Being a hard tail, you will need better skills to ride fast, as they are less forgiving of mistakes than a softtail. It will also need more maintenance and tuning than a better bike, and probably wear out faster. As far as trails you can ride - if the trail requires air time, the bike is not great. It would be OK on trail that can be ridden without having to do jumps, but is better suited to XC style trails rather than all mountain or down hill. In the end, you won't break it any quicker than a better bike, so go out and have as much fun as you can on it. 

To all practical purposes, neither person is right. Even if cross chaining wears out drive lines (highly debated), 1x11 cannot cross as much as 3x8. A correctly choose chain ring on a 1x11 means you will normally be in a mid rear cog, so in normal riding, very little cross chaining would occur. If you ride extremely hilly country, and often sit in very high or very low gears, then you will probably still have a similar chain angle to a 3x setup most of the time. Chain wear and lifetime of drive chain comes down to a combination of regular maintenance, how much and in what way a bike is used. Within measurable parameters, a 1x11 will not wear out faster or slower than a 3x8. Over a large number of samples there might (although I have doubts) be a very small but statistically significant difference. Why are you worried about wear. A 3x8 speed drive train is much cheaper than a 1x11, so replacement is cheaper. There are valid reasons to go 1x11, and valid reasons not to, but wear is not one of them. 

I am going to be presumptuous enough to ask what I believe is the question behind the OPs question, then answer that... The problem is that you have to inflate the tires more often than you like. The question then is what can I do to ensure my tires remain inflated for as long as possible. The answers Tubes - these keep the air molecules in. Thicker is better, as is better material. Dump the super thin light weight race tubes and get the thickest one you can find, I would even suggest giving cheap chain store tubes ago. Tires - Bigger tires can carry the same weight at lower pressures. Put in bigger tires and run at lower pressure. This has two effects - lower pressure leaks molecules slower, and more volume means those leaked molecules are noticed less. Exotics Look at the no-tubes and 'no puncture' slime solutions - these seal the holes the air molecules are escaping from. As previously suggested - invest in a decent pump. If you don't have room or desire for a floor pump by the door, get a pump that uses CO canisters (and wear the cost of canisters). If it is still a pain to pump up your tires - discard the plastic valve caps, and get rims/tubes with presta valves - it will take less than 30 seconds to top up two tires. You might have guessed all these solutions add weight and move away from the best of the best in terms of performance- well, that is expected, nothing is free and super light weight fast racing tires leak air, after all, as long as they stay inflated for the stage - up to 8 Hours, that's all that is needed and any longer is excess weight.
