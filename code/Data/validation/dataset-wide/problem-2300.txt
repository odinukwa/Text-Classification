Diving is first and foremost a PRACTICAL skill so the best way to practise is to do it. Yes you can read through the books to refresh your theory, but this will not refresh your ability to dive. But it can be helpful in reminding you about small things you may have forgotten. Practising hand signals can be good, but these we always confirm before dives as different divers from different places and different organizations might do dive signs a bit different. My suggestion is that you go for your first dive with a Divemaster/Instructor or very experienced diver on a nice easy shallow dive so you can just work through setting up gear, getting used to the feel of the gear as you swim (achieving Neutral buoyancy), breathing slowly and deeply in and out without holding your breath. Also remember to practise things like mask clearing, regulator recovery and clearing as these are things that happen more often and should be easy and effortless to do. If you been out of diving for a long time with very few dives it is worthwhile to do a whole refresher course with a qualified instructor to refresh all the skills you learned. This should be done in a pool (or very clear, calm, shallow ocean) followed up by a nice easy ocean dive. On the theory side I would recommend going through those adventure dives that you might be interested in doing and that have a bit more to them to think about: DEEP, NIGHT, WRECK, etc. 

Wet suit thickness is a very personal thing. I for instance dive in a 3mm shorty in 15C and higher and 3mm one piece for temperatures under 15C and above 6C Remember that you can also layer. So I would say a Dry Suit with thick under garment or a 7mm wet suit with a 3mm chicken vest underneath. Some nice thick gloves and hood and if you really cold then wear a 2nd layer of 5mm over the top. Here are some good guidelines. "Shorty wetsuits and dive skins are generally used in warm tropical waters with temperatures of 75°F- 85°F (24°C- 30°C) and above, depending on personal preference. Dive skins do not provide thermal protection, but do provide protection from accidental stinging by sea lice, fire coral and other small marine hazards. Shorty wetsuits provide a modest amount of thermal protection for core body areas. 2mm - 3mm (1/8 in.) wetsuits are generally used in warmer waters with temperatures of 70°F- 80°F (21°C- 27°C) and above, depending on personal preference. During cooler weather, additional warmth can be achieved through the use of a 3mm hood, addition of a 3mm hooded vest under the wetsuit and/or use of a 2-piece 3mm wetsuit. 4mm - 5mm (3/16 in.) wetsuits are generally used in cool waters with temperatures of 60°F- 70°F (16°C- 21°C) and above, depending on personal preference. During cooler weather, additional warmth can be achieved through the use of a 3mm-5mm hood and gloves, addition of a 3mm-5mm hooded vest under the wetsuit and/or use of a 2-piece 5mm wetsuit. 6mm - 7mm (1/4 in.) wetsuits are generally used in cooler waters with temperatures of 50°F- 60°F (10°C- 16°C) and above, depending on personal preference. During cooler weather, additional warmth can be achieved through the use of a 5mm-7mm hood and gloves, addition of a 5mm-7mm hooded vest under the wetsuit and/or use of a 2-piece 7mm wetsuit or semi-dry 7mm wetsuit. Semi-dry wetsuits have Neck seals, wrist seals and ankle seals that adhere to your skin to minimize water entry." Wet Suits for Temperatures More Wet Suit Thickness Tips 

You field dress the deer as soon as possible while maintaining your own safety. That really means that as soon as the deer is down, I go take care of it, except if I have shot it during the last few minutes of shooting light and I can't safely track the deer and do the work in the dark. Often I can do it in the dark if I have tracked it with enough light, but I once pushed this a little too far and had a really bad night and an extra 20 mile hike to get out. I won't do that again. Outside of your personal safety, you should get the chest cavity cleaned out and the animal started cooling as soon as possible. If you do shoot it in the evening and are going to let it cool overnight, try to prop it up on some logs so air can get underneath especially at the hind quarters, and tie the legs out so it is on its back with the chest cavity wide-open for good air circulation. Hope that a bear or coyote doesn't discover your deer in the night. Fur is a great insulator, so you need to maximize the air getting to the un-furred places on the deer. If you are hunting in warmer weather, you may have to work quickly to get the animal to ice, but since the answer is "as quick as possible", that means you are just going to have to do what you can as quickly as possible. You can't convince a deer that bolted and fell down a cliff that he should really have died in a better location for the haul out so you just do the best you can to be as quick as possible. :) If the night time temps are 40 deg F, you can let it cool at night and haul it out during the day. One trick is to take an old sleeping bag and let the deer cool overnight, then wrap in the sleeping bag to keep it cool for the drive home, or if your buddies are still hunting, using the bag to keep it cool during the day can let you hang it for three or four days while they finish up. Make sure you have a thermometer to monitor the meat temp. It should be less than 45 deg F all day. I hang mine in the shed with a remote thermometer I can watch from the house. If the temp gets up too high because of the weather, I go take the skin off and hang it in game bags in the fridge, rotating and moving it around 2-3 times a day. 

In most ways, it looks like porcupine to me. The scratch marks going perpendicular to the tree trunk make it less likely to be bear, deer, or elk. Bear will strip a tree like this if it is rotten and there are lots of bugs underneath the bark, but generally you see this in the fall, not this far into winter, and it is more often stumps and rotten trees. This tree looks healthy. Deer or elk generally don't strip it down to the ground so completely, and the shavings are much bigger, with the scratch marks going vertically. The only thing that is slightly different than my experience with porcupines is the amount of the tree that was stripped. Porcupines often take of a band around the tree about two feet tall about 7 or 8 feet up and it doesn't always go all the way around. That said, I still think it is porcupine as all the other details match. Did you notice any smell? On a deer/elk rub this size, I would stick my nose right up close to the ground and sniff. If you think you are at the State Fair animal barn, it is elk. If it smells faintly like animal, it might be deer. If it smells like nothing, it might be bear or porcupine. See this link "ASK A MASTER GARDENER: Porcupines likely culprits in stripping bark from maple trees" for a similar looking tree. 

For scuba diving this practice has no use. as you will be under water for a while and will be breathing compressed air from your cylinder. In the old days people used this for free diving / skin diving /snorkeling to be able to hold breath for longer. I do not want to go into long discussions why this works, but in layman's terms it suppresses the bodies urge to breath by lowering the Carbon dioxide in the blood, which is the main trigger for breathing. Hyperventilation is no longer considered safe even for free divers. 

Black silicon blocks out all light except that which comes in through the lenses of the mask, leading to less light from peripheral. Spear fishermen, technical divers, free divers tend to prefer this. Clear silicon tends to discolour especially when stored with black rubber. But as far as true visibility goes the black or clear silicon does not make a difference. Visibility can be improved by getting as low profile mask as can comfortably fit you. This will mean less air space in mask that needs to be equalized and greater visibility arc. 

There are different ways depending on how you swim, take photo/film, etc. A head mounted approach is easiest and shows people your POV (point of view), bubbles can be an issue depending on your reg and swimming position. But greater risk in losing it of your head. Some people hard mount it on a plastic type helmet (cycle/caving/construction) and then attach the helmet over their hood. Some people like chest mounted straps as this is more secure, but you need to swim less streamlined else you only see the ground below you, which can be great depending on where you diving. The other more versatile option is to place it on your wrist and then you swim with wrist pointing at what you want to film, also easy to remove and put on a stick if you want to get close-ups. Each method will need some practice to aim correctly, but best is to try all three and find the method that gives you the best results. 

Your breathing rate is not affected, although experienced divers always try and breath slow, deep and continuous, to conserve air and keep airways open. The higher partial pressure of gasses does however have many other effect on the body, including gas narcosis, oxygen poisoning and increased risk of dysbarism. (Just on a side note the pressure in your blood does not increase, but the amount of dissolved gasses does.) 

Batteries lasts at least 25% - 50% longer than your average dive time It uses standard batteries (AA, C or D) and rechargeable versions of standard batteries It uses LED lights (less power usage for more lumen and light tends to be white rather than yellow) Adjustable Strength - some dive lights have 2 or 3 settings so you can increase/decrease power as you need it Narrow beam, better to focus on what you are looking at
