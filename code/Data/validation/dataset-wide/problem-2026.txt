We have had lots of women go on maternity leave and come back successfully. In general we were very glad to have to them back. Companies are very different in how they treat this. So don't take one bad experience and think it is how you will be treated everywhere. In interviewing, I would look at larger companies as they can absorb the work during the maternity leave more easily. I would also look at the average age of the employees. You would be happier in a place with middle-aged (you understand middle age starts at 30, right?) people who are married. They will understand your needs better than a place filled with 20-something single guys. You want to look for a place that already has a flexible work-from-home program if you want to do that especially if you want to come back part-time. Do a lot of women appear to work there? In general, professional women tend to end up in places that are more supportive of women's needs. Ask to see the HR manual when you get the job offer and look for place that has a policy for paternity leave. It's not a killer if they don't, but any place that does allow it is likelier to be more understanding of parental issues. But the key is to ask about the conditions you want. If they turn you down because you asked about maternity leave, then you probably would not be happy working there. From your earlier questions, I think you are in software development. In that case stay away from start-ups and game companies. They will expect you to routinely work 60+ hours a week which is a bad thing for a new mother. Programming to support a company's main business may not be as cool, but it is a whole lot more supportive of women's needs because they generally have women in other fields as well. And a company that has a large portion of women in their main business is very used to dealing with maternity leave. Look at the health care, financial, defense business sectors or government work (just few to get you started thinking that way) instead of businesses that only do application development. 

Whether you want to or not, you need to come clean about what happened. You need to discuss this with your CEO, your HR and possibly your company lawyer. You need legal advice so that you don't open your company to a lawsuit particularly if he is in fact the most qualified candidate and not one of the most qualified. Even if they choose to hire him, there may be reason to make sure you are not in a reporting relationship. 

You need to talk to your local HR about what options you as a manager have to deal with this. Policies will vary from company to company. When I worked for the federal government if you were late, you took an hour of vacation time. That will solve the issue very quickly for most people but it depends on your local labor laws and HR policies if this is an option. In HR terms usually you start with a written warning. Then escalte through various steps. You need to be careful about giving your good worker leeway that the others don't get. If you want to fire someone else for being consistently late, you can have a legal problem if you allowed someone else to be consistently late. If you don't want to bring up this particular person's performance to HR's attention, then go talk to them in general terms about what you need to know as a supervisor about how to handle varous employee problems so you can be prepared when they come up. 

Both sides miss out on a lot of the body language, so it far easier to misinterpret. As an interviewer, you miss out on the chance to check with others about their perception of the interviewee. In an in person interview how an interviewee treats people he casually run into is often taken into account. They are looking for fit and people who are rude to the receptionist are often eliminated for that alone. You miss out on evaluating the person's hygiene. Yes that sounds silly but I once had someone show up for an interview for a client-facing position wearing no shoes and very visible dirt up to her knees (well that was as far as I could see). So it really is a factor. She would have appeared fine in a video interview where we only saw her face. It is also easier for a remote interviewee to have someone else in the room feeding them the answers to technical questions. So many interviewers are likely to be primed to be more impressed with the answers they get from people in person. And people do relate better to people they have actually met. There probably is even an unconcious bias in favor of the people they met in person in many cases. I bring that up because the interviewee would have to work harder to impress on a video interview because there is a bias to overcome in many cases. From the interviewee side, you miss a chance to independently evaluate the work conditions, how the people in the office appear to relate to each other (If you have have ever walked into an office where everyone hates everyone, it is appranet within seconds from the tension in the body language and the tone of voice people use to each other). You miss out on seeing if the noise level is such that you can live with it, you miss out on meeting people who are not the interviewers (and sometimes you run into someone who knows you who will give you a good reference). Does the place seem regimented or relaxed? Interviewers will often make a place sound better than it actually is (and to be fair, they aren't necessarily deliberately lying-one man's quiet, relaxed place can be another man's noisy, tense place), you can better evaluate the place with a chance to walk through the offices yourself and observe for yourself. Does this mean you should never video interview? No, sometimes it is the best option if the person is in another country and you don't want to spend the money to bring them in. Just that both sides of the table may have to work harder at it to get the information they need to move forward in the hiring process. As na interviewer, I likely would not want to consider it for a client-facing postion (sales, account management, consultants, etc.) where you really really need to knwo how the person relates to other people in general. As an interviewee, I would not want to do it all if there are any other options avaiable because you are at a disadvantage in comparison with people they interviewed in person and you don't get a chance to evaluate them as well as you might want. 

You do need to push back,. This is simply unacceptable. However, don't just say you need 5 weeks, give him and his boss a breakdown of the tasks and the time to do them to prove it takes five weeks. In your breakdown of tasks make sure to include time to support QA, time to respond to the inevitable changes, time for communication (reading and responding to emails, project meetings, etc.), time for writing unit test and for performing testing and debugging. Tell them what features can be removed to meet the deadline. (Do not suggest getting rid of QA - the worst project I ever worked on eliminated QA before the production launch to meet a deadline, it took a year and half to clean up the mess (and at least 4 managers involved in the debacle got fired) and make the client happy) Do not agree to work the extra hours to get the job done unless you get paid or get some other reward. Working extra hours generally lengthens the amount of time it takes to do the project because exhasuted people work slower and make far more mistakes. If he pushes back on the hours let him read this: $URL$ 

I am of the disposition that has found that keeping such things secret can be much more harmful than discussing it openly. That is my personal bias. However, you have to judge what is the norm in your workplace, the personality of your boss, and the potential for the event to impact your performance. For instance, I have relatives I have not seen or spoken to in years. If one of them were to die, I would be sad but it would be something I could easily compartmentalize and not have it affect work. So no need to discuss. That certainly was not the case when my beloved died after 26 years together. I cried at work every day for a year, so it was impossible to hide. Even the worst boss is also a human being. Almost everyone will understand why the death of a child or a spouse would drastically affect you. Further, If you have brought such things up, you can get bereavement leave and you are more likely to get allowances for any immediate performance problems. People will likely ease your workload for at least the first couple of months. (Incidentally if your boss is one would would not be understanding of such things, that is a huge red flag that this is a very bad place to work, everyone has personal problems eventually.) Most bosses prefer to know if there is a potential problem, so they can rearrange task assignments, deadlines or whatever might be affected. It is pretty much essential if you are going to take bereavement leave or use your personal vacation time to deal with a situation. It is the professional thing to do to tell them. You can (and should if you value your privacy) ask them not to tell anyone else about it except possibly others like HR would might need to know if there is an accommodation to make. Ask him to talk to you before he talks to any of these other parties. A benefit of telling such information is that people will reach out to support you in any decent workplace. Co-workers will offer to help with your work load, people will tell you about how they coped through similar times, people may organize food for you or offer to drive you to places you need to go to etc. The only time I have seen it generate bad feelings when someone told us about a personal issue was when the person was in control of when the thing happened and chose the worst possible time. (She chose to leave her husband the week before a huge deadline and left us stranded with her work undone. And well, frankly, she wasn't well liked either because she was having an affair with the CEO which led to the divorce.) But when people let us know the issue, people tended to rally round and help. Sometimes people don't tell and then use it as an excuse after they are reprimanded for poor performance. That, too, does not go over well. If you are going to have performance issues or see that you have started to have performance issues, talk to your boss as soon as you can. People can;t make accommodations when they don't know they need to. Also be aware that no business can accommodate forever. You have to try to get yourself together as soon as you can. There are also some things you probably do not want to tell or at least don't want to make a big deal out of. People have been fired for having some diseases like AIDS. Drug abuse is also something that is likely not going to be looked on as a good thing. Expecting performance accommodations for your hangovers is another. A breakup is less likely to get an accommodation than the death of a child. You might be able to take a day or two off, but no one is going to let you mope for weeks and have that not affect your performance evaluation. No one cares that your pet fish died or you have a flat tire. Telling all the minor things that have gone wrong and treating them like they are major is not a good thing for your career. It makes you look like someone who can't handle ordinary life. People will see you as someone trying to get out of work if you think your flat tire should give you a pass that day for concentrating once you get to work. (Yes this is a real-life example.) You also ask if there is an appropriate way to tell someone. If the death or event happened when you were not at work and you need to take the next work day off, then use the same channels you would to call in sick. In today's world that is often an email. If, however you are at work when you find out and co-located with your boss, then go tell them in person. If your boss in in another physical location then use the phone by preference and email as second choice. Telling coworkers is another consideration. If they are going to be asked to take up the slack for you, it is probably best to tell them in general terms. You can just say you are having a personal problem or that you have been diagnosed with a medical issue but do not want to discuss the details. Or you can ask your boss to tell them what you want them told. As a minimum, they need to know you are dealing with a personal problem if it is going to affect there workload. If you want to keeps things fairly quiet, you can tell people who you consider to be friends if you think they will maintain your secret.
