Finally, hereâ€™s a set of graphs I made of normalized temperature, density and pressure for an $n=3$ loaded polytrope and an $n=3$ normal polytrope. While both temperature profiles are quite similar, there is a sharp difference in density and pressure near the core. 

Could a massive planet amass large quantities of nitrogen and oxygen? Could these gases be the main ones the planet is composed of? 

Use Hexamethylene triperoxide diamine (or another organic peroxide)! Hexamethylene triperoxide diamine is an organic peroxide, which can be formed when hydrogen peroxide and hexamine (obtainable via the combination of formaldehyde and ammonia). Certain catalysts must be used, but they are obtainable by organisms. Hydrogen peroxide itself is explosive, but is inorganic. You would need a source of it for the creatures to use. Acetone peroxide could be used instead of hexamethylene triperoxide diamine, but it, too, needs to be made using hydrogen peroxide, and it is more unstable. Other organic chemicals that can apparently explode/ignite/cause something fiery: 

In the year 21--, a crew of 100 sets out from Earth on the good ship Tenzing Norgay, bound for Epsilon Eridani. The journey is estimated to take . . . well, quite some time, given that it was calculated that the time spent to engineer a significantly faster propulsion system (compared to the technology of the day) would negate the benefits of going at the faster speed, and would end up costing too much more.1 This means that the crew is stuck with using a ship outfitted with the Rockaway Plastopedic ThrustomaticTM 2 engines, making the trip take at least 250 years - far more than twice the lifespan of a normal human. It was also decided, to the crew's dismay, to not pursue suspended animation technology, thanks to budget cuts. The one thing that the make of the ship did foresee was that a future generation might not be too happy about having to live and die in a ship, without ever stepping foot on a planet or doing anything besides get ready to reproduce and die. There is a very real threat of a person (or a group of people) hijacking the ship some day, and moving it to some nearby system. The computers are always on autopilot, but there's always a way to hack them. The government decides to go with a foolproof method: using genetics to make sure that future generations on the ship will not rebel, using in vitro fertilization onboard via automatic systems. This is all very well and good, but I, the creator of the story, need to come up with a plausible explanation. I can imagine a few ideas, but they're not too good; they all boil down to neural modifications - changing genes to influence the brain. I'm no neurologist, but this doesn't sound feasible. How can genetics be used to quell a rebellion before it begins? 

To overcome the first problem, I turned to Henneberger (2009), courtesy of Kyle Kanos in chat. It's taken me about ---48--- 75+ hours to digest, and I can hopefully post something of a starting point for an analysis tomorrow. In part, I have to compensate for the fact that some of its calculations are based off of "slab geometry", unlike our cylinder. I will also include some helpful information from Jauho and Kamenev (2004), regarding Green's functions and the Keldysh formalism. I'd like to note that the results are the most important part, though understanding the derivation is helpful. That said, I haven't been able to follow all of the derivation, so the analysis should be interesting. . . The energy flow from an object not in thermal equilibrium is $$s=-\frac{i}{2q_0}(n^<\mathfrak{P}^>-n^>\mathfrak{P}^<)$$ Explaining the variables: 

Is whoever's going to consume this actually going to benefit from more science? That is, will they understand the world better if you add this much detail? Will the device or situation become more plausible? Is it necessary? Consider Chekhov's gun. If you describe in detail how someone manipulates strings, it must be essential for the plot. Same goes for any spaceship engine, weapon, piece of technology, etc. 

Schedules suck. I mean it. They ostensibly bring order and design into our lives, but they end up creating unnecessary rigidity. There are a few of us who have, for better or for worse, decided to go against using schedules. A good example is a newborn baby. Mom and Dad might want to tuck in around ten o'clock and wake up at six-ish, but the baby will decided when and where it wants to wake up, nap, relieve itself, etc. It does things when it wants to. In this sense, the baby may be smarter than its parents. Why should I get up at six in the morning and go to school if I'm overly tired, or leave around three because that's when we get kicked out of the building? On these days, I could just as easily go wake up at eight, get in by ten and be out by five. I would function really well. The baby may not know this, but it acts accordingly subconsciously. If society behaved like this, then at first there would be issues. Continuing the school example, some students might want to wake up at five, and some might want to wake up at eleven. That clearly creates a problem, one of synchronization, which we have to get rid of here. But why is this a problem? It's that we have to interact with other people, for better or for worse. According to the rules we set down, I have to walk into a room at X time, where I will then be greeted by an overly perky person with a cheery smile. We do this because we have to work together, even though in many cases this will clearly turn out worse for one of us (me, in most cases. I'm not a morning person!). The society would behave like the baby, acting on what I'll call the Principle of Selfish Convenience, which we can view as a short-sighted member of society trying to reach Cournot equilibrium. Without a natural cycle, there is no need for them to do things that are not important at the moment. Instead, they look for short-term needs. Each person has to do Y things to keep living, and they'll each do them according to when it benefits them. Without some method of keeping time, they'll have to develop a mentality seemingly alien to us. If we were to create some sort of an algorithm to describe this, it would run accordingly: 

Interesting models have been made of T Tauri stars, pre-main sequence stars that can have strong magnetic fields (though clearly not as strong as those of magnetars). Data is given in Johns-Krull (2007). The effects of this magnetic field on interactions between the star and its surrounding disk were modeled in (among others) Kuker et al. (2003). Angular momentum is transferred between the star and the disk. The torque generated by the magnetic field on the star is $$T=2\pi r^2 \int_0^\pi (\mathbf{t\cdot r})\sin \theta d\theta $$ where $\mathbf{t}$ is $$\mathbf{t}=\frac{r\sin\theta B_{\phi}}{4\pi}\mathbf{B}$$ and $\mathbf{\cdot}$ denotes the dot product (vectors are represented in $\mathbf{bold}$ type). The authors primarily use spherical coordinates. In this model, angular momentum is transferred from the star to the disk. However, in a situation with one or more orbiting bodies, there remains the possibility that some angular momentum could be transferred to one or more of the bodies, thereby changing its orbit. 

That said . . . I don't see any of these being problems at the depths you give, for the simple reason that your sharks won't be living in deep water at all. 

I think we've established that this monstrous object is going to have to be pretty darn big. You suggested that it could be 500 kilometers in diameter; let's do the calculations to figure out just what the effects would be. From Wikipedia, the median velocity of an oncoming object hitting Earth is about 22.5 km/s. From here, we can assume hat the asteroid (because this thing is going to have to be big) has a density of about 2 grams per cubic centimeter. Let's also say that this thing hits the Earth perpendicularly - i.e. it is a direct hit. We know that the plates are about 100 kilometers thick; therefore, we need the crater to be that deep if we want to throw everything into total chaos. Using this handy-dandy calculator, we find that an impact with those parameters would create a crater 529 kilometers deep and 2,115 kilometers wide. Now that is what I call big. Earth's average radius is about 6,370 kilometers, so while this might not split the planet in two, it would give it a devastating blow. We can adjust the values of the body to accommodate the results you want. If the crater will be about 100 km deep, we only need an asteroid 80 km wide, creating a crater with a diameter of about 407 km. The material ejected by the impact would be spread out over 874 kilometers, creating a sizable dent in a continent. That's all just accounting for the crater. I suspect you would need a larger asteroid to do the kind of geological damage you're suggesting. But an asteroid even only 80 km wide would most likely throw the Earth into an impact winter longer than it has ever seen before. The object that killed the dinosaurs was probably only about 10 km in diameter. I'm a bit scared about what could happen if an asteroid 80 km wide hit Earth. Most likely, as you hypothesized, all life would be wiped away.
