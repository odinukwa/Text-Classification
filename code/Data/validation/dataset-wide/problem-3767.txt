Consider the category $FdVect_k$ of finite dimensional $k$-vector spaces, for some given field. It is abelian, semisimple, in that each object is a finite sum of simple objects (of which there is only one up to isomorphism), and also compact closed with simple tensor unit which is a progenerator. Can we characterise $FdVect_k$ as a category of vector spaces purely by properties of the category such as above? I don't mean to demand for instance that $End(I)$ is a field, for instance, and I suspect that this may stop any such characterisation. But this I don't mind, seeing as if rings which are 'nice enough' cannot be distinguished from fields in this way, then so be it. I should point out that if someone says 'but what about Morita equivalence?', then I'm not sure that's right answer, since I'm looking for equivalence as a compact closed semisimple abelian ... category, not just as a bare category - but I may be wrong on this point.

I don't know if I have a favourite either, but here's another one: crossed modules in $Grp$ are strict 2-groups aka group objects in $Cat$ aka category objects in $Grp$. 

I imagine that there are sets of naturals in $Z_2$ that cannot be proved to exist in $PA2$, but where is the boundary? From the Wikipedia page I see that $ACA_0$, a subsystem of $Z_2$ with restricted induction, is a conservative extension of $PA$ (and equiconsistent with $PA$), and I infer that $ACA$, the same subsystem plus unrestricted induction, would be a conservative extension of $PA_2$. 

Colin McLarty has made a study of what it takes to define derived functor cohomology (with sheaf cohomology as a special case given a topos of sheaves). He finds that finite-order arithmetic (the union of $Z_n$ for $n=1,2,\ldots$) suffices 

Short answer: you don't want to consider group cohomology as defined for finite groups for Lie groups like $U(1)$, or indeed topological groups in general. There are other cohomology theories (not Stasheff's) that are the 'right' cohomology groups, in that there are the right isomorphisms in low dimensions with various other things. Long answer: Group cohology, as one comes across it in e.g. Ken Brown's book (or see these notes), is all about discrete groups. The definition of group cocycles in $H^n(G,A)$, for $A$ and abelian group, can be seen to be the same as maps of simplicial sets $N\mathbf{B}G \to \mathbf{K}(A,n)$, where $\mathbf{B}G$ is the groupoid with one object and arrow set $G$, $N$ denotes its nerve and $\mathbf{K}(A,n)$ is the simplicial set corresponding (under the Dold-Kan correspondence) to the chain complex $\ldots \to 1 \to A \to 1 \to \ldots$, where $A$ is in position $n$, and all other groups are trivial. Coboundaries between cocycles are just homotopies between maps of simplicial spaces. The relation between $N\mathbf{B}G$ and $K(G,1)$ is that the latter is the geometric realisation of the former, and the geometric realisation of $\mathbf{K}(A,n)$ is an Eilenberg-MacLane space $K(A,n)$, which represents ordinary cohomology ($H^n(X,A) \simeq [X,K(A,n)]$, where $[-,-]$ denotes homotopy classes of maps). This boils down to the fact that simplicial sets and topological spaces encode the same homotopical information. It helps that $N\mathbf{B}G$ is a Kan complex, and so the naive homotopy classes are the right homotopy classes, and so we have $$sSet(N\mathbf{B}G,\mathbf{K}(A,n))/homotopy \simeq Top(BG,K(A,n))/homotopy = [BG,K(A,n)]$$ In fact this isomorphism is a homotopy equivalence of the full hom-spaces, not just up to homotopy. If we write down the same definition of cocycles with a topological group $G$, then this gives the 'wrong' cohomology. In particular, we should have the interpretation of $H^2(G,A)$ as isomorphic to the set of (equivalence classes of) extensions of $G$ by $A$, as for discrete groups. However, we only get semi-direct products of topological groups this way, whereas there are extensions of topological groups which are not semi-direct products - they are non-trivial principal bundles as well as being group extensions. Consider for example $\mathbb{Z}/2 \to SU(2) \to SO(3)$. The reason for this is that when dealing with maps between simplicial spaces, as $N\mathbf{B}G$ and $\mathbf{K}(A,n)$ become when dealing with topological groups, it is not enough to just consider maps of simplicial spaces; one must localise the category of simplicial spaces, that is add formal inverses of certain maps. This is because ordinary maps of simplicial spaces are not enough to calculate the space of maps as before. We still have $BG$ as the geometric realisation of the nerve of $\mathbf{B}G$, and so one definition of the cohomology of the topological group $G$ with values in the discrete group $A$ is to consider the ordinary cohomology $H^n(BG,A) = [BG,K(A,n)]$. However, if $A$ is also a non-discrete topological group, this is not really enough, because to define cohomology of a space with values in a non-discrete group, you should be looking at sheaf cohomology, where the values are taken in the sheaf of groups associated to $A$. For discrete groups $A$ this gives the same result as cohomology defined in the 'usual way' (say by using Eilenberg-MacLane spaces). So the story is a little more complicated than you supposed. The 'proper ' way to define cohomology for topological groups, with values in an abelian topological group (at least with some mild niceness assumptions on our groups) was given by Segal in 

If $M$ is paracompact, or more generally $P$ is trivialised over a numerable open cover, this map is indeed the classifying map for $P\to M$. Note that the universal bundle $EG \to BG$ is given by the geometric realisation of $G\rtimes G \to \ast \rtimes G$, since you are assuming $G$ well-pointed (so that $|N (\ast \rtimes G)| \simeq BG$). So to show that $M\to BG$ as you give is the classifying map, it is enough to show that $P\times_M N \simeq c^\ast EG$, where $N:= |N(P\rtimes G)|$ and $c\colon N\to BG$. Since $M$ is paracompact, $N\to M$ is shrinkable, and hence a homotopy equivalence. Thus given a section, pulling $P\times_M N$ back along this section gives a bundle isomorphic to $P$, as pullback along homotopic maps (in case the identity, and pulling up then back down) gives isomorphic bundles, which gives the result that $M\to BG$ classifies $P$. Now assuming that we use the k-space product, or that all the spaces involved are locally compact weak Hausdorff, then geometric realisation of simplicial spaces preserves pullbacks. Thus $c^\ast EG$ is given by the geometric realisation of the nerve of $(P\rtimes G) \times_{(\ast\rtimes G)} (G\rtimes G)$, and $P\times_M N$ by the geometric realisation of the nerve of $\underline{P}\times_\underline{M}(P\rtimes G)$. Thus we only need to show that there is an isomorphism of groupoids $$ (P\rtimes G) \times_{(\ast\rtimes G)} (G\rtimes G) \simeq (P\times G) \rtimes G \to \underline{P}\times_\underline{M}(P\rtimes G) \simeq (P\times_M P) \rtimes G, $$ where the action in $(P\times G) \rtimes G$ is diagonal, and the action in $(P\times_M P) \rtimes G$ is on the right factor of $P$ only. The map on the level of objects is just $$ P\times G \to P\times_M P, $$ sending $(p,g) \mapsto (p,pg)$, and by principality of the action this is an isomorphism. The map on the level of arrows is $$ P\times G \times G \to P\times_M P \times G $$ sending $(p,g_1,g_2) \mapsto (p,pg_1,g_2)$, again an isomorphism. It is not too difficult to see that this is funtorial, and so we get an isomorphism of geometric realisations as desired. As far as a reference is concerned, Segal's paper Classifying spaces and spectral sequences, Publications Mathématiques de l'IHÉS, 34 (1968), p. 105-112 (Numdam) is probably the best, though he doesn't give the direct argument from above, using instead cocycles for an open cover (if you think of the space P as a cover over which the bundle P trivialises, then his argument can be applied to recover the above). 

(answering my own question - who would have thought?) There is a paper by G Allaud (Arch. Math 1968) which describes a counterexample as sought by the question. Let $E$ be the subspace of the plane $\mathbb{R}^2$ consisting of the non-negative integer points $(n,0)$ on the $x$-axis together with $(0,1)$ and a line connecting it each point on the $x$-axis. Let $B$ be the subspace of the plane consisting of the origin and the points $(1/n,0)$ on the $x$-axis for positive $n$ together with $(0,1)$ and a line connecting it to each point $(1/n,0)$ and $(0,0)$. The map $E \to B$ is given by sending $(0,0)$ to itself, $(n,0)$ to $(1/n,0)$ and the obvious map on the line segments. This is then (according to Allaud) a Serre fibration which is not a Dold fibration. 

Let $\kappa$ be an inaccessible cardinal, and let $G$ be a group with $|G| \geq \kappa$. For any cardinal $\lambda \le \kappa$ (regular, say, but not necessary), say $G$ is $\lambda$-simple if for all normal subgroups $N \lt G$ we have $|N| \lt \lambda$. Clearly a group is simple iff it is $2$-simple. Can we force (or even construct without forcing) a $\lambda$-simple group $G$? 

A Serre fibration is clearly defined with motivation from homotopy theory, but we can consider smooth versions $f\colon M\to N$ in the category of (finite-dimensional, paracompact etc) smooth manifolds, namely any smooth homotopy $H\colon I^n\times I \to N$ and smooth map $I^n\times\lbrace0\rbrace \to M$ lifting $H(-,0)$, there is a smooth lift of $H$ to $M$. For $N$ connected and $M$ non-empty, it is necessarily surjective. Clearly smooth fibre bundles are Serre fibrations, but arbitrary surjective submersions are not (for example: $[0,\frac{2}{3})\coprod (\frac{1}{3},1] \to [0,1]$). However, I have reasons to consider fibrations with connected fibre. I have a rough sketch of a proof in my head that smooth Serre fibrations are not far off being submersions, but that may just be the result of an overactive imagination. I'd like to know what's the ugliest that a smooth Serre fibration with connected fibres can be. Single examples are welcome, as are characterisation theorem. Secondly, what sort of fibres do we get? (Clearly they just might not be manifolds) Conversely, what nice properties are smooth Serre fibrations with connected fibres guaranteed to have? 

Here is an expansion of my comment, by request. The 2-category of Lie groupoids $\mathrm{LieGpd}$ admits the category of manifolds $\mathrm{Mfld}$ as a full sub-2-category (i.e. $\mathrm{Mfld} \to \mathrm{LieGpd}$ induces an iso on hom-groupoids), but the category of Lie groups $\mathrm{LieGrp}$ only has a functor $\mathrm{LieGrp} \to \mathrm{LieGpd}$, not full on 2-arrows, sending a group to the coresponding one-object groupoid. I think this is one reason why Lie groupoids are not best seen as a generalisation of Lie groups. Given a group $G$ acting on $M$, there is a groupoid $M//G$ with objects $M$, morphisms $M\times G$ with source and target given by projection and action, respectively. This includes the boring case where $M=*$, but the mix of potentially positive dimensional orbit space $M/G$, interesting orbits $mG$ nontrivial stabilisers $G_m$ is more typical of what is happening in the Lie groupoid case. Nice Lie groupoids, for instance proper Lie groupoids $X$, where $(s,t)\colon X_1\to X_0\times X_0$ is a proper map, locally look like group actions (times a codiscrete groupoid $U\times U \rightrightarrows U$), so this is sometimes a lot of what you need to consider anyway. Functors are just equivariant maps, where you can be equivariant with respect to a homomorphism $G\to H$. Generalising from this to general Lie groupoids you need to forget the fact that the source map has identical fibres, and that there isn't some global group containing all the stabilisers. 

This procedure cannot continue for more than $\gamma$ steps, so $\alpha \le \gamma$. In fact we can probably take $\alpha \leq cof(\Gamma)$, where the latter is defined as the smallest ordinal mapping to a cofinal sequence in $\Gamma$, and replace $\phi$ by the function witnessing this. However, what if $\Gamma$ is a proper class, with a class ordering $\leq$ (EDIT: and is 'set-like', in that initial segments are all sets)? Firstly, is it possible to get a cofinal, order-preserving class function $Ord \to \Gamma$ in ZFC? (EDIT: No; see Joel's answer) How about if I have a given class function $Ord \to \Gamma$ with cofinal image, but not assumed to preserve orderings? If I can, it would seem I could get something like (this is my main aim) $$\Gamma = \bigcup_{\alpha \in Ord'} \downarrow c(\alpha),$$ where $Ord' \subset Ord$ is some cofinal subclass and all the $\downarrow c(\alpha)$ are sets, all in ZFC (EDIT: or NBG+GC..). Is this correct?
