9.17 (a) in the baseball rulebook covers wins for pitchers, and it explicitly mentions that the pitcher can be awarded a win even if removed before the team gains the lead. 

I don't hear it much outside this specific context, but would generally assume that an at-bat for a team (instead of an individual) covers the portion of a single inning that a team is on offense. This ESPN story confirms that usage for this statistic. 

There are a few other rules that then determine what happens next. If most of the game has been played and one team is ahead, the game can be called (ended) and a winner declared. In other circumstances the game can be postponed and resumed later or replayed from the beginning. If possible, umpires would prefer to stop between innings, but weather or equipment failure may not make that possible. Time is not normally a factor in MLB games (they can be played quite late), but it can happen. A 1984 game between the Brewers and White Sox was still tied after 18 innings. The game was suspended at that point and resumed the next day and completed in the 25th. 

The ball is foul and the play is dead. The rulebook reference defines a fair ball (Definitions section, page 142 in linked version): 

No, the batter cannot run. The ball is "live" for the purposes of the defense and any runners already on base, but it doesn't allow the batter to leave, and the batter is not in jeopardy of being put out. This situation (foul tip on strike two) does not fit any of the criteria of 5.05, and therefore does not entitle the batter to become a runner. 

Even without any intent on the attacker, touching the puck in the zone appears to be sufficient to call the offside. 

So even though other pitchers may have performed worse or the team scored some runs after the fact, because Tanaka allowed the other team to take the lead and that lead was never relinquished, he is credited with the loss. 

Phillip Kendall's comment about this being a fielder's choice situation is correct. Batter 2 (Rosales) reaches on a single, so is Tanaka's run on base. After the pitching change, batter 3 (Davis) reaches on a fielder's choice. The ruling is basically that without Tanaka's runner (Rosales) on base, Davis would have been out and no runners on. So Davis continues to be charged as Tanaka's baserunner under 9.16(g). Batter 4 (Joyce) walks and is credited to Clippard. Batter 5 (Lowrie) singles. This drives in Davis. The earned run is credited to Tanaka. As this run put Houston in the lead, Tanaka is then on the hook for the loss until the game becomes tied or the Yankees retake the lead (which did not happen). 

I don't have access to a rulebook of that era, but I've not heard of this before. Baseball Almanac has a page listing major rule changes over the years. As this seems quite "major" to me, I'd expect it to appear there. I see several mentions of changes to the save rule, but not for wins and losses. A copy of a relevant rulebook would be best, but short of that I'm leaning to "no, there doesn't seem to have been a change in this rule since the '60s" 

Conditions for awarding wins and losses in MLB are listed in the Official Baseball Rules. This is covered by Rule 9 (specifically 9.17(d)) which directs the official scorer. 

Besides the number on a racer's jersey, professional races often require numbers to be attached to the bicycle frame as well. 

A fielder would never be expected to be between third base and the batter, so the situation depends only on where the runner is standing. If the runner is in fair territory, it would be an out. If the runner is not in fair territory, then it is just a foul ball. Because of this, all runners on third would be expected to make sure they stay outside fair territory when taking a lead. That way they are not at risk of being out on a drive that they fail to avoid. 

I think you are seeing them stop, not start the stopwatch. They are timing how long it takes from the back line to the first hog line. This time can be compared to previous throws to see if the rock will be heavy or light. If the time is long (rock is underthrown), they can get on the brooms immediately and try to stretch it. 

If the play does not result in a forced third out, then the game ends when the winning run scores. Given the play description, it's almost certain that the force at third base happens before the run scores. It's unlikely but not impossible that the run scores before the force at second base. So the most likely finish is 1-0 with two outs, but it depends on the order things happen. 

I can't see anything in the rules that suggest that the offense (team A) would not be able to accept the penalty and retry. There are specific rules that apply when both teams foul and there is a change of possession (11-3-3-6). Therefore, I presume that the rules for when only the defense (team B) fouls will apply in cases where there is and is not a change of possession. From 11-3-3-4 (NFL Rulebook) 

They did in fact finish with the same time in this stage. If you take a look at the full classification for stage 6, you will see that this was a sprint finish, so most of the riders finished together in a large bunch at the finish. To avoid having riders trying to bump each other in large finishes, timing results in bunch finishes are aggregated. If there is no "gap" between you and riders in front of you (it appears that you cannot go faster in your line without interacting with riders ahead), then you will be given the same finishing time as the first rider in your bunch. In stage 6, this bunch was large and the first 120 riders to cross were all given identical finish times of 5:05:34. The next rider was scored as having a gap and was given a different time. So for this stage, Chris Froome (who finished 56th) and all the leaders finished with identical times and there was no change in their relative positions in the general classification. Besides the official finish time, a rider may receive either bonus or penalty time. The first 3 finishers received a bonus, one rider received a penalty. But none of them were in the top GC list. This bunch finish is an expected occurence for sprint stages, with most of the movement between GC leaders happening only on mountain and time trial stages. Stage 6 finish times are found on the Tour de France page. Click the "stage" button to flip it to times for the stage rather than total GC time. 

If the runner missed third base, then they are not entitled to score and are not in a safe position until and unless they return to third. (Sounds like this was happening). If the runner is tagged with the ball before returning to third base, it's an out. Touching or not touching home plate doesn't matter much here. The runner shouldn't be automatically out for doing so. Although as a little league game, there may be some additional rules that differ from mlb. 

An "ask the umpire" piece on MLB notes what could happen for cases that are not covered by the rules (such as an animal removing the ball from play). 

Most Olympic sports are competed by individuals, or by teams that are are assembled from individuals in a selection or trial process. But curling (at least in the US) selects existing teams to represent in the mens and womens events. (Even after reading the US curling site, I'm still not clear on how the mixed event is selected) Are there any other sports where existing teams of players compete for selection instead of individuals? A team should be larger than 2 people for the purposes of this question, so not counting any pairs events. 

The rationale here is that when the defense stops the ball carrier, it is preferable that they do not get any benefit from holding the carrier up (so the play would remain live) and just pushing them backward a huge distance instead of tackling. This concept is in the rule book as "forward progress" 

Curling and maybe rowing. I couldn't find anything official, and I didn't understand all the information I found on rowing. I went down the list of Olympic sports and made my own list of sports that seemed to involve team competition. Most are pretty obvious, but several I wasn't certain of. Sailing in particular appears to only have events with one or two sailors at a time, so not a team event for this question. My list: 

The high points: If a player is sent to the minors for more than 20 days in a season, that is an "option"able assignment. Teams are normally permitted to do this up to 3 times (years) for a player. So a player that goes up and down his first 3 years in the league will be "out of options". If the team doesn't need the player on the major league roster, and the player doesn't have a remaining option, they would have to release him, trade him, or allow other teams to acquire him (place him on waivers). There is no limit to the number of times a player can sent back and forth in a season that their option is exercised, but they normally have to remain on the minor-league roster for 10 days once sent down. After 5 years in the league, the player has the right to refuse option assignments (even if options remain). There are several other infrequent cases possible. I don't know of any official MLB public page that shows all of the exact rules. This Cubs page has a good description of how this works and has a lot more detail. 

My interpretation is that the fake psychic character is using this as a situation to show his knowledge (or psychic ability) by predicting the play that the offense was about to run. It looks to me that he says "out round" not to the other players, but to his partner, and then celebrates the result of the play as if his prediction were correct. Now, what would "out round" mean here? As Ram commented, it's similar enough to "out pattern" that it sounds like a route for a receiver to run. Unless someone knows of a specific meaning for the phrase, my suspicion is that it is simply a throwaway line that didn't mean anything in particular, but sounds like a plausible NFL play. 

I've never heard of an animal removing a ball from play entirely before. The PBUC Umpire Manual does suggest what should happen in the slightly more likely case of striking an animal. 

This is covered in section in rule 12, section V of the NBA Rule Book (page 46 for the linked edition). Although commonly called the "Bonus", the rules refer to this as the "penalty" or the "free throw penalty situation". In a regulation quarter, you get 4 common fouls without penalty, while in an overtime period you get only 3. During the final 2 minutes of a period, you have a maximum of one more foul without penalty (even if you have committed zero fouls to that point). So 2 fouls in the final minute would guarantee penalty throws. 

NBA used to be 2-3-2, but has moved back to 2-2-1-1-1 since 2014. Note that the leagues using it (NHL/NBA) don't normally schedule back-to-back games during the playoffs. So the impact of the travel day is reduced. Baseball tends to prefer several games in a row. 4 travel days between 7 games would be an unusual pace. 

Those are the only two. The two mentioned, plus L.A. Coliseum as currently used by the Rams. The end zones at Metlife can be (somewhat) easily removed so the team logo for the playing team is displayed. But the time and effort to do the same on the center is prohibitive. For the Panthers, it was apparently such a big deal for Carolina to get the franchise that the owner Jerry Richardson put it there as a way of thanking the NFL. The placement of the shield seems to be his personal decision. In an ESPN Story, he's quoted: 

Sporting News record book suggests: 867 by Washington in 1886 (122 games) If you only want after 1900 then 425 by Detroit in 1901 (136 games) According to baseball-reference.com, since 2000, the leagues (with 30 teams) have never recorded more than 3500 errors. Between 1901 and 1917 the leagues (with only 16 teams) never recorded less than 3500 errors. For more information, root around on baseball-reference.com. I don't know of a perfect summary, but you can see team fielding stats for every individual year. As an example, to see team stats for 2014, go to $URL$ 

So given your conditions of the team retaining the lead for the remainder of the game, the starting pitcher is credited with the win. 

I'm wondering what level of baseball you were watching. The regulations could be different for different leagues. A timer like you describe is usually for the benefit of broadcasters to have a specific amount of time to break for commercials. The extra five seconds would let them rejoin after two minutes and not be in the middle of the first pitch. The umpire will hold the game to not start before the time is up. Once done, the ump should control the pace of game as at any other point in an inning. If the players aren't ready, he'll go and try to move them along. There's no automatic penalty for not being ready. Now if the ump feels that someone is trying to delay the game intentionally, he can force things to happen, but that isn't usually necessary. In MLB, 5.07(c) specifies that when there are no runners on base, the pitcher should be delivering the pitch within 12 seconds of having the ball and being notified that it is in play. This rule is rarely invoked in the majors.
