I'm not entirely sure what you're looking for in an answer, but maybe I'll flesh out my comment. It looks like what you're describing is equivalent to the homotopy category associated to the model structure on Cat where the weak equivalences are equivalences of categories. (I can say "the" because there is only one such, as pointed out in the comments. The cofibrations are functors injective on objects, and the fibrations are "isofibrations".) I would say that in this context your category has been much studied. In particular, it is interesting to ask questions about homotopy limits and colimits in this category because many useful constructions arise in this way. (Homotopy (co)limits with this model structure are the same as "2-(co)limits" which is the name appearing in most of the literature, especially older literature.) An example application of this language is the following theorem: The subcategory of presentable (resp. accessible) categories is closed under homotopy limits. Using this one can prove that most of your favorite things are presentable (resp. accessible). For example, the category of modules over a monad arises via a homotopy limit construction, and this takes care of most things of interest. Here's a neat application of this (which is the ordinary category version of a result that can be found, for example, in Lurie's HTT, 5.5.4.16.). Say you want to localize a category $\mathcal{C}$ with respect to some collection of morphisms, $S$. Usually $S$ will not be given as a set, but if $\mathcal{C}$ is presentable you're usually okay if $S$ is generated by a set. Well, it turns out that if $F: \mathcal{C} \rightarrow \mathcal{D}$ is a colimit preserving functor between presentable categories, and $S$ is a (strongly saturated) collection of morphisms in $\mathcal{D}$ that is generated by a set, then $f^{-1}S$ is a (strongly saturated) collection of morphisms generated by a set. The argument goes by way of showing that the subcategory of the category of morphisms generated by $f^{-1}S$ is presentable, using a homotopy pullback square. Adapting this to the model category or $\infty$-category setting, one sees immediately that localizing with respect to homology theories is totally okay and follows formally from this type of argument. (Basically, after fiddling around with cells to prove the category of spectra is presentable, you don't have to fiddle any more to get localizations. This is in contrast to the usual argument found in Bousfield's paper. You've moved the cardinality bookkeeping into a general argument about homotopy limits of presentable categories.) Anyway, apologies for the very idiosyncratic application of this language; these things have been on my mind recently. I'm sure there are much more elementary reasons why one would care about using the model category structure on Cat. 

I'm sure there's some highly general proposition in HTT where Lurie proves something where this result is a special case, but I couldn't seem to find such a thing so I've written down some words that I think constitute a (rather messy) proof... I think a lot of what I say is probably unnecessary, so I'll try to clean it up a bit later: write up (also- it'd be really nice if I could actually just post documents here since I don't really have a webpage, I just sort of made one up on some site that I'm not even sure everyone can see...? Is there a way to do this?) 

Well perhaps Adams did things a little out of order, but this should work: We know that $h \circ i_0 = f \circ j$ where $j: A \rightarrow X$ is the inclusion map. Now choose representatives of the compositions, $k$ and $k'$, so that $k = k'$ on some cofinal spectrum in $A$. Next choose representatives for $h, f, i_0,$ and $j$ on some other cofinal spectra in $X, A$, and $Y$. It must be the case that $h \circ i_0$ agrees with $k$ on the intersection of the cofinal spectra you chose and similarly for $f \circ j$ and $k'$, so replace the cofinal spectra you chose with their intersection (on $A$), and you should be good. Of course, probably the better way around all of this is to replace Adams' treatment of CW-spectra with something like Mays' (you don't need all the fancy machinery, but at least define a CW-spectrum using pushouts of stuff with cones on sphere spectra.) Then you can just copy the usual proof of this fact from the unstable case. 

Poincare' and Algebraic Topology: Poincare's (basically) single-handed invention of homology and homotopy theory in 1900 really changed everything. He sowed the seeds for a great deal in differential geometry, analysis, homotopy theory, homological algebra, category theory, and algebraic geometry with the 'simple' concept of a functor (though it certainly wasn't called that) from spaces to groups. It tied spacial reasoning to algebraic reasoning in a way that, as I said, changed everything. 

Lurie proves a version of straightening/unstraightening which produces, for a scaled simplicial set $X$, a Quillen equivalence between a certain model structure on $\left(\mathrm{Set}^{+}_{\Delta}\right)_{/X}$ and a certain model structure on $\mathrm{Fun}(\mathscr{C}^{sc}(X), \mathrm{Set}_{\Delta}^{+})$ (where $\mathscr{C}^{sc}$ is a scaled version of $\mathfrak{C}$). Passing to a scaled version of the nerve, if $X$ is fibrant, produces a map of $(\infty,2)$-categories $X \to \mathsf{Cat}_{\infty}$. The first condition for fibrancy here is that we have an inner fibration on the underlying simplicial sets. I'll skip saying anything about this... you could draw some pictures for $\Lambda^2_1 \subset \Delta^2$ and convince yourself that if the definition of $(\infty,2)$-category says you can 'compose' 2-morphisms in an essentially unique way then you'll be ok. And it does! The next condition for fibrancy is that the marked edges coincide with the locally $p$-cocartesian edges. Intuitively, suppose we have a morphism $(X,Y) \to (X', Y')$ and we've chosen a lift $X \to Y$ of the object $(X,Y)$. Then a morphism covering the given one is the data of a 1-morphism and a 2-morphism from that to the composite $X' \to X \to Y \to Y'$. The universal choice of such is to take "the actual" composite and have the 2-morphism be the "identity". Of course, we're in a weak world, so to do this for real I'd have to tell you more about the definition of an $(\infty,2)$-category. Finally, we need to know that $p$ restricts to a cocartesian fibration along any thin 2-simplex. To check it, you need to know that composing locally cocartesian lifts of each leg gives you a locally cocartesian lift of the 'composite'. Using the characterization of locally cocartesian lifts from before, and the assumption that you're covering a thin 2-simplex, this becomes the statement that 'thin 2-simplices compose to thin 2-simplices' i.e. that 2-equivalences are closed under composition. (Again, really you check some filling condition and so on...). 

Now, for various reasons, coming from manifold theory (if you're Sullivan) or just trying to understand some elements in the stable homotopy groups of spheres (if you're Adams), people got interested in understanding the cohomology theory you get by taking the 'fixed points' of $\psi^m$. That is, they wanted to understand the cohomology theory $J$ that has a natural transformation $J \rightarrow K_p$ and such that, for any space $X$, you get a long exact sequence $$J^n(X)\rightarrow K^n_p(X) \stackrel{\psi^m -1}{\longrightarrow} K^n_p(X) \rightarrow J^{n+1}(X) \rightarrow \cdots$$ When you choose $m$ correctly (I'll say how in a second), this cohomology theory deserves the name $S_{K(1)}$ which stands for '$K(1)$-local sphere' because it sees a very special sector of the rainbow that makes up the sphere (or more accurately, the 'stable' phenomena of the sphere). It is this object which we will now raise to the "1/2 th" power, and maps out of this will constitute elements of $\pi_{1/2}$. The key is to notice the following: 

Lurie characterizes the symmetric monoidal structure on $\mathsf{Sp}$ by a universal property (HA.4.8.2.19): it is uniquely determined up to a contractible space of choices by the property that $S^0$ is the unit and $\wedge$ commutes with homotopy colimits in both variables. I think on first glance this sounds like one of those formal things that doesn't help you 'compute' anything, but I claim that (i) you can get all the computational mileage out of this that you usually get from model categories of spectra and (ii) if you like, you can easily show that your favorite symmetric monoidal model category of spectra models this symmetric monoidal structure. We'll start with (ii) since that's what you asked about, and it's easier. Suppose you have a model category $\mathbf{M}$ which models spectra (which is something else that can be checked easily from universal properties by its relationship to some model for $\mathsf{Spaces}$, for example). Suppose further that it's a symmetric monoidal model category. Then the underlying $\infty$-category $\mathsf{M}[W^{-1}] \cong \mathsf{Sp}$ inherits a symmetric monoidal structure. To compare it with the 'universal' one, one needs to check that the tensor product commutes with homotopy colimits and that the unit is weakly equivalent to the sphere spectrum. The unit requirement is just always satisfied (otherwise what sort of spectra are you using??) and the homotopy colimit requirement is also always satisfied, because part of the definition of being a symmetric monoidal model category is that $\otimes$ be a left Quillen bifunctor- and that forces the tensor product to commute with homotopy colimits in both variables. Now let's talk about (i). What does it even mean to 'understand' the smash product of spectra? Well, usually the way a spectrum is handed to us is as a sequence of (say, pointed) spaces $(X_k)$ and maps $\Sigma X_k \to X_{k+1}$. Every model ever includes at least that much data, often with all sorts of extra requirements and structure. But in any case, this data presents a spectrum $X = \mathrm{hocolim}_k \Sigma^{-k}\Sigma^{\infty}X_k$. So, from the universal property we learn that $$ X \wedge Y = \underset{j,k}{\mathrm{hocolim}}\, \Sigma^{-j-k}\left( \Sigma^{\infty}X_j \wedge \Sigma^{\infty}Y_k\right). $$ So now we'd better figure out how to compute $\Sigma^{\infty}A \wedge \Sigma^{\infty} B$ for pointed spaces $A$ and $B$. It's possible to argue very abstractly that $\Sigma^{\infty}$ must be symmetric monoidal, using the methods in HA.4.8.2, but you can also argue as follows: first reduce to the unpointed case, so we want to compute $\Sigma^{\infty}_+A \wedge \Sigma^{\infty}_+B$. But $A$ and $B$ are homotopy colimits of constant diagrams shaped like $A$ and $B$, respectively. And $\Sigma^{\infty}_+$ commutes with homotopy colimits. A little string of equivalences and the fact that $\Sigma^{\infty}_+(*) = S^0$ is the unit gives the result. Excellent, so just from nonsense we learn that $\Sigma^{\infty}$ is symmetric monoidal. Moving back to our original formula we learn that a 'concrete' computation for the smash product is: $$X \wedge Y = \underset{j,k}{\mathrm{hocolim}}\, \Sigma^{-j-k}\left( \Sigma^{\infty}X_j \wedge \Sigma^{\infty}Y_k\right) = \underset{j,k}{\mathrm{hocolim}}\, \Sigma^{-j-k}\left( \Sigma^{\infty}(X_j \wedge Y_k)\right).\quad (1)$$ If you like, then at this point you could pick your favorite cofinal copy of $\mathbb{N}$ inside $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ and present this smash product as a sequence of spaces with maps from the suspension of one to the next. This way of thinking about the smash product is the very original one, going back to Boardman and Adams. Of course they ran into all sorts of technical issues verifying all the properties they wanted out of a symmetric monoidal structure. What happened to those? Well, when dealing with a symmetric monoidal structure one would like (a) properties and (b) the ability to 'compute' what the thing does. The original approach was to begin with (b) and then work hard to verify (a). In the present situation, one begins with (a) using various levels of sophistication and then deduces (b). Of course, lots of technical work went into producing the symmetric monoidal $\infty$-category $\mathsf{Sp}$! But the work pays off: you get a much stronger theorem and a more flexible theory.
