▻ THE PERVASIVENESS AND INEVITABILITY OF DECAY 'For everything that has come into being there is decay'. This is a perfectly general statement about the physical world, held by Plato to apply well beyond the psuche and the polis. It is taken to be true of everything that does not belong to the transcendental world of Forms. ▻ PLATO IS NOT OFFERING A PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY The important point to realise is that Plato is not offering a philosophy of history. It is not clear that the kallipolis, the ideal polis, outlined in the Republic is taken by Plato to be realisable. This doubt is clear from Rep. V.471c-472e. It is an ideal pattern or 'pure case'. If there were an ideal city, this is what it would be like. Plato does not claim unambiguously that the ideal pattern can be implemented. ▻ THE IDEAL POLIS (KALLIPOLIS) AS A MORAL METRIC What the account of decline in Rep. VIII-IX does is to show the relative imperfections of four kinds of defective polis as measured against the ideal city. Plato never says that he is offering an account of the actual course of history. The progression of decline is a classification of degrees of defectiveness by the standards of Plato's ideals, not a prediction of how events will go when the ideal polis (which might not ever exist) begins to decay. Timarchy, oligarchy, democracy, and tyranny are each in turn further from the virtues of the kallipolis, the ideal polis. Tyranny is the most distant and the most seriously imperfect of the four; democracy is bad but not quite so bad as tyranny; oligopoly is bad but not so bad as democracy; and timarchy is bad but not so bad as oligopoly. Timarchy is imperfect but is the least imperfect of the four kinds of state; it represents the least decline from the kallipolis. ▻ TYRANNY - NO EXIT Plato does not need to find a way out from tyranny because his aim is not to predict the occurrence of this kind of polis and the terrible predicament it will land us in. Rather, his aim is only to show that tyranny is the polar opposite of the kallipolis. ▻ ARISTOTLE'S MISUNDERSTANDINGS In what Trevor Saunders describes as one of Aristotle's 'puzzlingly unsympathetic criticisms of Plato' (Aristotle, 'The Politics', London : Penguin, 1992, p.351), Plato is taken to task by Aristotle for the historical implausibility of his account of constitutional change, of the political decline described in the 'Republic'. Just how completely this misses the point is made clear in a classic article by A.E. Taylor : 

Oh, but you do deserve a mark even if your question and my reply disturb the moral pieties. If ethical egoism is a coherent moral theory - and it is among the options standardly discussed (if usually rejected) in ethics tertbooks - then human conduct should be based solely on self-interest. 'Self-interest' is likely to provoke a volley of shots here, so let's say that ethical egoism is the view that everybody ought to look out for her- or himself alone, or that everyone ought to concern him- or herself only with their own welfare (as conceived by them). As an ethical egoist you could defend, 'No, because I need to be paid', with complete moral propriety and consistency. There would be a cost to ethical egoism if you value love, friendship, comradeship, but there is no logical need to include these values in your idea of your own welfare. Ethical egoism is rejected by Kantians, most utilitarians, human rights theorists but how strong are their theories ? Aren't the journals, and questions on Philosophy Stack Exchange, standing proof that none of the relevant theories is free from objections just as strong as any that they pitch at ethical egoism? But if one plumps for utilitarianism, ethical egoism and utililtarian can be squared on two assumption. (1) If we accept Jeremy Betham's dictum that each person is the best judge of their own interests, the maximisation of interests is more likely to be satisfied if each person aims purely for their own interest. After all, they (rather than some well-meaning other agent) best knows what it is. (2) Interests, even best judged, may of course conflict but this is an empirical and contingent point. Conditions are imaginable in which they do not. If they do not, and if each person is the best judge of their own interests, interests are likely, more likely than not, to be maximised by ethical egoism. References : P. Facione, D. Scherer & T.

The basic idea is that if all our actions were determined by our own natures, and to no extent by external causes, then in this sense we would be free. Nothing could conflict with or thwart our wants and preferences, or desires and aversions. In a harmonious world in which all were free in this sense there would be no hindrances or frustrations in experience to generate the contrasting ideas of good and evil. Freedom requires more than that all our actions are determined by our natures. There is an inescapable role for rationality. This will be explored in the next section. ▻ REASON AND EVIL We are not born free. We do have ideas of good and evil. Thus Spinoza can say : 'A free man never acts deceitfully, but always in good faith' : Homo liber nunquam dolo malo, sed semper cum fide agit. (Ethics, IV, Proposition 72; Parkinson, 279.) What supports this statement ? If we have adequate ideas, ideas of which our own natures or essences are the complete cause, then it is clear to the intellect, or reason, what is in our interest. What will then be clear is that 'if men are led by a clear-sighted view of their own interest, they will naturally tend to live on peaceful terms with one another, and to help each other' (R.J. Delahunty, Spinoza, London : Routledge, 1985, 271. This makes sense but it is hard to extract from Spinoza ! The closest Spinoza seems to come to such an argument is at Ethics, IV, Proposition 35, Corollary 2 : 

CRITERIA OF NARCISSISM I'd say self-confidence tips over into narcissism (which we nearly all display at least at times and in areas of our lives) when self-confidence transforms itself into : 

3.Therefore all dogs have teeth It doesn't matter if any or all of these sentences are false. The sentences have been set out in an argument in which 3. (the conclusion) cannot be false if 1. and 2. (the premises) are true. The argument is valid regardless of the truth or falsity of 1. and 2. This is an example of logic. In the reasoning example it mattered quite a lot whether your beliefs and assumptions were true. If you were wrong about the climbability of the tree, you'd break your neck. In logic the actual truth or falsity of the sentences is irrelevant - at least it involves no such catastrophic risks. Situation 3. I've taken an example of practical reasoning but reasoning differs from logic even if we select theoretical reasoning - reasoning about the facts. A laptop has been stolen. You know you didn't steal it. Did your flatmate ? Possibly but s/he had no reason you can think of for doing so - not short of money, has own laptop, &c. There is a new tenant but it is unlikely they could have got access to the laptop. But there was a mystery caller to the house just before the laptop disappeared. Most likely they had a skeleton-key, nipped in and abstracted the laptop. This is sound and sensible reasoning but it is not logic. All your assumptions (premises) could be warranted and rational but the conclusion false. In the event it was the property-owner who stole the laptop. ▻ Step back now and theorise the differences a little. Reasoning is psychological. It is about working out means towards ends, applying rules to cases, deciding which of two or more incompatible beliefs is better evidenced, puzzling out who stole the laptop, whether X will make a good partner. It centres on belief (formation and revision) and inference. ▻ Logic by contrast is not psychological. At all. It centres on the correctness or validity of arguments. It is not concerned at all with whether the premises are true or false or whether the conclusion is true or false. Its sole focus is whether the conclusion must be true if (IF) the premises are true. If the conclusion must be true if the premises are true, then the argument is valid. The argument itself cannot be true or false; it can only be valid or invalid. ▻ Logic and reason are not totally unconnected. One can reason logically. Suppose I reason as follows : I believe that p is the case; I also believe that if p is the case then q is, must be, the case; so I believe that q is the case. I might mentally chug through this. (I believe that x is red; I believe that if x is red then x is coloured; so I conclude that x is coloured.) Rather a simple example but it makes the point - that my reasoning is logical in the sense that it can be represented in logical form as modus ponens : p; p → q : q. ▻ The catch comes - and reason and logic part company - when we adopt a certain type of logic. I don't know how much logic you know but certain forms of 'truth-table' logic can validate implications that make no sense for reasoning of the sorts we've looked at. In certain forms of logic, a conditional is true if the antecedent ('p') is false and the consequent ('q) is true. 'If the moon is made of green cheese (p) then 2 + 3 = 5 (q)'. Truth-table logic of this kind is capable of perfectly sound defence but that defence does not include its agreement with reasoning of the everyday kind considered here.
