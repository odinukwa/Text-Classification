It would be interesting to make a list of principal ancient texts and how each of them reached us. And make a statistics. (Perhaps someone knows such a list?) Many of the texts that I know exist in both Arabic and Greek medieval versions. Before this list is made, I want to express my doubts about Tyler Durden answer. He only gives examples of literary work (Tacitus, Virgil etc.) But another principal component of ancient heritage is science. The role of Muslim world in preservation (and spread!) of ancient science is very large. And the reason is that science was actually practiced in the Islamic world. (Unlike the West and the Byzantine empire). They not only preserved the ancient books but added lot of the results of their own research. Apparently Islam was more tolerable to the ancient science, and people were not only allowed to practice it but were supported by the rulers. Some scientific books were also copied in Byzantia, it is true. True but very strange. Just imagine this job: copying a book which you do not understand:-) 

In Germany, the people were brought to the leaders' bidding by first: creating jobs, improving the economy, breaking the Treaty of Versailles and reinstating the sense of National pride. Targetting Jews and Gipsies was, in a way, self-evident: they could be the scape-goat and play the role of the enemy that has already infiltrated the country. They were seen as the ones that stole the wealth of the German people. People are worryingly gullible when it comes to things like this as American schoolteacher Jane Elliott's infamous experiment has demonstrated time and time again. Here's a clip There have been many experiments like this, and all of them seem to come to the same conclusion: When people are put in a situation where they feel they have the right to exercise power over another group, violence ensues, and is even seen as justifiable. Ironically, a more recent example of this can be seen in Israel, and the way people treat muslim refugees. They aren't even referred to as refugees, but "Infiltrators", in the same way the Jews were seen as the enemy that lived within back in WWII Germany... 

I am afraid this question cannot be answered, because the fate of the library is not known. It is unlikely that it still existed at the time of Theon. For the first time it was burned by Ceasar in 48 BC. It is not known how much remained after this first burning and whether it continued to function as a library. Another possibility is that it (or what remained of it) was destroyed by Aurelian (200s AD). In 391 AD pagan worship was abolished by Theodosius, and pagan temples were closed. The library was a part of the temple of Serapis, so certainly it did not exist as a library after that time. This was during Theon's lifetime. He was 12 years old. 

Disclaimer: As I was made aware of this by Drux' comments: my answer may lead some people to believe that I am in some way justifying people not intervening, or even actively participating in the Holocaust. If read the comments below, I hope it is self-evident that this is not the case. Just to be clear: I absolutely and unequivocally condemn any action that discriminates on the basis of religion and or race, be it in the past, present or future. My main interest, as far as history is concerned, is 20th century geo-politics. The question of how could this happen is one that we all ask about every genocide. What I tend to do (and attempted to do in my answer) is to shift that question to could this happen (again) today or is it happening again. Of course, when attempting to apply this very sensitive subject (WWII genocide) to modern-day politics, I recognize the fact that bad choice of words or phrasing can lead to misunderstandings. It also stands to reason that a 1-on-1 "projection" of past events onto the present is, by definition false/flawed. But the cliché of history repeating itself is, IMHO, not all together absurd. Anyway, it is not my intention to hurt people, I am not trying to negate or minimize any of the atrocities that were committed. My only goal is to communicate what I believe are genuine similarities between the rise of Nazi Germany and today's political tendencies/evolutions. And to avoid any further misunderstandings, let's not beat around the bush: I have no sympathies towards anything even remotely resembling fascism or (neo-)Nazism whatsoever. So if you are a neo-Nazi looking to recruit: try your luck at the local asylum, or try reading a book, instead of using it as a hammer. If the contents of my answer below offends anyone for any reason, do not hesitate to leave a comment, and I'll be happy to clarify whatever needs clarification, or edit my answer in accordingly. 

This is a meaningless question unless you focus on some period in history. Racism is a relatively modern invention. Almost any person before 16 century would have a clean record in this respect by modern standards. 

The main work which lays the foundation of Marxism is not the Communist Manifesto. It is the many-volume theoretic work which is called Capital (Das Kapital) by Marx alone. The Manifesto is just a short pamphlet, stating the main conclusions. In the Capital Marx, developed an economic theory, from which he concluded the inevitability of the development of the society towards communism. Many later socialists recognize the analysis given in Capital, though not all subscribe to the statements in the Communist manifesto. 

When you speak of WWII and the Holocaust in particular, it stands to reason that the same "rule" applies: the people aren't actively asking for pogroms. But Göring continues: 

From the off: The phrase "Wir haben es nicht gewusst" is a lie. Many Germans have later admitted that the deportation and mass killing of Jews, Gipsies and political prisoners was a public secret. At first, it could well be that not everybody was equally aware, and yes, the German economy was headed in the right direction, and yes the Nazi regime did manage to create jobs, and instill on the people a lost sense of pride. So it's not unlikely that, at first, people were willing to subject themselves and others to the nasty sides of the regime. By the time the ghastly things that were going on had become this public secret, the Nazi apparatus had managed to infiltrate every aspect of daily life, though. There are recorded accounts of children that got sent home from school, and were expressly prohibited to attend classes until they joined the Hitler Jugend. Though this does not serve as justification, with the rise of fascism, there grew a sense of terror among the population, too: if they didn't contribute, that was seen as a sign of rebellion, and thus they, too, could fall victim. But that's just one of many reasons why the Nazi's could keep on doing what they did, and does not answer your question. For that, we need to go back to the end of WWI. Germany had capitulated, and was heavily punished (Treaty of Versailles). WWI was in part caused by the Germans wanting a part of the colonial pie that the rest of Europe were having (among other things of course) as you may know. While the Treaty of Versailles was said to be about making amends and repaying war damage to those countries involved, it also prohibited Germany to expand its borders (ie: no colonies). Do not underestimate the social trauma a nation can sustain when, already having had to admit defeat, being forced to forego the perks (colonies back then were seen as a nations right) other countries so happily grant themselves. A nation is a mass of people, and a mass behaves irrational and emotional (like a toddler). Tell a 3 year old it's done wrong, punish it and then tell it, it has to watch while other toddlers are eating its sweets, it'll cry, kick and scream. So there was a genuine feeling of betrayal and disgruntlement in Germany. There had also been a long tradition of antisemitism in Europe. Couple that to the rise of Communism (Russian revolution happened during WWI) and you have: Anger, Fear (of Communism) and a not-well-liked minority. That's an explosive mix, no matter how you look at it. All you need is a spark: a charismatic leader, preferable one that also manages to restore some of the national pride that the country in question seems to have lost. An interesting read in this respect is "The Nuremberg Diary". Gustave Gilber, an American psychologist interviewed Hermann Göring and wrote their conversation down: 

Napoleon's career as a national hero started after his military victories during the "revolutionary wars" in France (Toulon) and Italy. His next adventure was expedition to Egypt which ended with a humiliating defeat, but somehow this was not clear to most in France, and they made him a dictator with strong popular support. The later spectacular victories of the French army very much increased his popularity. He was able to ride on the wave of patriotism. I understand this seems weird to some people, but one has probably to take into account almost a century of previous continuous British-French wars. Probably it seemed to many people that he is able to finally win this competition. 

Leaders are indeed the ones that make out the policies, both domestic and foreign. It is they who stand to gain from conflict. Economic and geopolitical factors come into play, and quickly overtake humanitarian considerations. As far as the leaders of a country are concerned, human casualties become statistics, and are seen as part of the cost vs benefits analysis. Basically, it's as Joseph Stalin (allegedly) stated: 

Back to Göring, though, Gilbert points out a possible flaw in Göring's logic: the fact that a democratic society couldn't possibly elect a gouvernament that institutionalizes the prosecution of certain groups of people: 

Slavery certainly did not "grow out of feudalism". Slavery is a much older and much more global institution than feudalism. Those who started transporting slaves from Africa to North America did not do anything new. Long before that, slaves were transported from Africa to Spanich and Portuguese colonies in Caribbean and to South America. Slavery in Africa itself existed since pre-historic times, and a large scale export of African slaves was performed by the Muslim traders since the establishment of the first Caliphate. Historians estimate the total volume of East African slave trade (performed mostly by the Muslims) as approximately equal to to the volume of the West African trade (performed by the Christians). But Islamic slave trade lasted much longer (from 7th to 19th century). Africa was not the only major source. Another major source was Eastern Europe. And not only Muslims were involved in Eastern Europe. For example, the state which later become known as Rus (on the territories of modern Ukraine and Russia) was established by the pagans from North Europe whose main business was slave trade. This business was discontinued when the Rus became Christians, but later a massive slave trade from Eastern Europe as continued by the Muslims. They sold these Slav slaves everywhere, including Western Europe, until slavery was prohibited in Western Europe. Both Christian and Muslim religions in principle ban or restrict slavery of people of the same religion. So after the antiquity slavery slowly declined in Europe, and in some Muslim countries. But this did not prevent from performing it "abroad". Some sources: P. Frankopan, The silk roads, Bloomsbury, 2016, M. White, The great big book of horrible things, Northon and Co, NY, London, 2011. А. П. Толочко, Очерки начальной Руси, Киев, 2015. 

Even more worrying, though: this phenomenon is so inherent to human nature, we don't even notice it's going on all around us: After 9/11, Bill Mahr caught some slack for saying the suicide attackers were not cowards. At the same time, Howard Stern stated that America should choose "any Arab country, they're all harbouring terrorists, and just nuke 'em". Bill Mahr was fired, Howerd Stern wasn't. Look at the people who have used the quote: "You're either with us, or against us" in various forms here: Lenin (Communist), Mussolini (Fascist), George W Bush (US president), Hillary Clinton (US Foreign Secretary) and Vic Toews (Canadian public safety minister). Since the Communist and Fascist dictators, the phrase has always been used in a context of threads to national security, mainly terrorism. This threat is also used to justify mass surveillance, invasive searches in airport security, The patriot act (Christ, patriotism and (extreme) nationalism is in the name), active prosecution of whistle-blowers like Edward Snowden, and racial profiling. Now think about these things, and read the quote by Göring a second time:
