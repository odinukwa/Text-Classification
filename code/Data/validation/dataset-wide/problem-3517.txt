Short answer It doesn't seem like you've tried very hard to find estimation using Dynare (google results of "Dynare estimation"). Dynare is in fact capable of doing estimation and typically people use some sort of data to estimate the parameters that govern their model. Longer Answer What is a DSGE model? A DSGE model is a series of equations (and variables and parameters) that describe a "model" economy. Once you write everything down and take into consideration the optimizing decisions made by the agents, it is simply a system of stochastic difference (differential) equation that you can imagine writing in some form along the lines of: $$ E_t F(y_{t+1}, y_t, y_{t-1}, u_t) = 0$$ What does Dynare do? The majority of introductory examples only use Dynare to solve the model and run some simple simulations. In addition to being able to solve the model, Dynare is also capable of doing Bayesian estimation of the parameters that make up the model by feeding in data. Solves and simulates the Model Dynare takes this system of equations (and the given parameter values) and solves them using perturbation methods. One of the outputs of the solution is a law of motion for all of the variables in the economy -- i.e. one can write something along the lines of $$y_{t+1} = F(y_t, u_{t+1})$$ This law of motion allows you to generate model analogues of the data that you are interested in -- i.e. capital, labor, consumption etc... Estimates the model Once Dynare has a law of motion and has obtained simulated moments, it can compare the output of the model to data that you have provided. Dynare uses Bayesian estimation (though it is possible it does other types, but I'm not familiar with it) to estimate parameters which means that you need to provide it with a prior for each variable that you would like to estimate. It then uses a simple Metropolis Hastings algorithm to obtain estimates for the distribution over parameter values. References I would recommend you read both of the following references. 

It doesn't in general. It did in this specific case because the Nikkei and Topix had earlier priced in the possibility that the Bank of Japan would do something other than leaving rates unchanged this time. Now that that possibility has gone, the market no longer needs to price in the possibility, and so has corrected. That's not just specific to this case: that's true of all market responses when an unknown event becomes known. 

If mortgage payments are included in the basket of goods that are used to calculate inflation, then rising interest rates will increase mortgage payments, causing an increase in inflation in the short term. This happens before any of the disinflationary effects show up in the data. 

You are not going to be able to forecast oil and gas prices with any useful accuracy at all. Lots of people try, and as far as we know, every one of them has failed. If anyone has ever succeeded, then they've become extremely rich through it, and they're not telling anyone the secret. If you did succeed, then your energy economics model would be completely irrelevant to you, as you'd be too busy trading the oil market, and eyeing up which tropical island you should buy next. The best you can hope for is consistency in your model. And then sensitivity-test your model based on a broad range of assumptions. For example, my usual 95% credible range for the price of a barrel of oil in 2030 is USD(2016)Â 5-500. So, what do you look for, for consistency? Demand and supply. Have short-run and long-run curves for both. If you're forecasting more than five years ahead, you must have some kind of uptake model for substitutes too, as well as short-run and long-run supply curves for them. Depending on how complex your model is, you might want to model storage too, particularly if modelling in less than 5-year time steps. 

As you stated, transitivity is that overall $x \succeq y$ and $y \succeq z$ implies $x \succeq z$. I will show an example where majority rule isn't transitive and hopefully it will answer your question. Imagine that we live in a world with three people: Person 1, Person 2, and Person 3. Each of these people have preferences over three outcomes $x$, $y$, and $z$. Every decision in this world is made according to majority rules, i.e. The outcome chosen is the one preferred by at least two of the individuals. Now imagine that the three people have preferences according to: 

Unfortunately (or fortunately depending on how you look at it), we don't know what $x$ and $y$ look like in this equation. Instead we are given $(x' x)$, $(x' y)$, and $(y' y)$. Using your comment about what RSS actually is -- Namely, that $$\text{RSS} = (y_{\text{observed}} - y_{\text{estimated}})' (y_{\text{observed}} - y_{\text{estimated}})$$ First notice that $y_{\text{estimated}}$ is simply $x \beta$. Then replacing this in the previous formula gives us \begin{align*} \text{RSS} &= (y_{\text{observed}} - y_{\text{estimated}})' (y_{\text{observed}} - y_{\text{estimated}}) \\ &= (y_{\text{observed}} - x \beta)' (y_{\text{observed}} - x \beta) \\ &= y'y - 2y'x\beta + x \beta \beta' x' \end{align*} Now this is almost what we want. We want things to ultimately be in terms of $(y'y)$, $(x'x)$, $(x' y)$, and $\beta$. The first term is exactly $y'y$, but other terms look like they have pieces we want and we just have to find a way to get them. Now, notice that each of the elements in our equation above is simply a scalar (aka sizes are such that they are $1 \times 1$). The determinant of a scalar is itself, then by using properties of determinants we can say: \begin{align*} 2y'x \beta &= \det(2y'x\beta) = \det(2 \beta' x' y) \\ x \beta \beta' x' &= \det(x \beta \beta' x') = \det(\beta' x' x \beta) \end{align*} I will leave the linear algebra itself as an exercise. 

It's not hard to see the transition to clean energy being one in which energy's role in the global economy diminishes, as externalities get priced in, and as energy efficiency consequently becomes much more cost-competitive. Furthermore, a very large proportion of clean energy (hydro, wind, PV) has very low operating costs; whereas dirty energy has much much higher operating costs. 

In general, an LCoE forecast for a year, is the unit cost of electricity for generators that come online in that particular year. Whereas, for a given year's (e.g. 2030) forecast of the cost of electricity, the average unit cost of electricity is a volume-weighted arithmetic average of the levelised costs of all the generators that have been built previously, that are operating in the forecast year. Typically, those generators will have been built in the previous 20 years. That's not the only challenge: 

In addition to the solutions that FooBar presented in his answer, one of the ways that people are able to get rid of multiple equilibria is incomplete information. I can't find the papers that are most relevant to your example at the moment, but the "canonical" example that I think of is Morris Shin 1998. Essentially what happens is the following: Their model is a model of a "currency attack." There is a state of the world that determines whether a currency attack is worthwhile or not and to successfully attack a currency a certain number of investors (which depends on the state) must participate in the attack. Under complete information multiple equilibria can be supported, but with even a very small amount of noise in their signal about the underlying state of the world the equilibrium becomes unique. One relevant paper could be "Coordinating Business Cycles." I don't remember most of the details in this paper, but it essentially has the same type of result in a more fully developed model.

A pigouvian tax is on goods or services that are known to have negative externalities, and for which some estimation of the economic value of those negative externalities can be made, and is there to correct the market failure. Its goal is to improve economic efficiency. A sin tax is on goods or services judged to be morally negative. Its goal is to reduce consumption and/or appease the moralists and/or raise revenue in a way that is less likely to be successfully opposed. 

It all depends on what you mean by inflation and by money supply. Technical questions and answers need specific definitions, otherwise everyone ends up talking at cross-purposes. Is it possible to have an increase in general price levels without any changes to the amount of money in circulation? Yes: if the velocity of circulation of money increases, and the amount of goods and services available to buy does not increase by as much. Is it possible to have an increase in general price levels without any changes to the amount of money in circulation or the velocity of circulation? Yes: if the amount of goods and services available to buy, decreases, so that there's more money chasing fewer goods. Is it possible to have an increase in general price levels without any changes to the amount of money in circulation or the velocity of circulation, and with no decrease in the amount of goods and services available to buy? Yes, if the demand curve changes so that the same amount of money is now used to buy a smaller quantity of stuff at higher prices. Is it possible to have an increase in general price levels without any changes to the amount of money in circulation or the velocity of circulation, and with no change in the amount of goods and services bought? No, because the velocity of circulation is by definition total transaction value divided by the amount of money in circulation, so if velocity, quantity and money supply are constant, then prices must be too, because total transaction value equals prices times quantity. 

Additional Comment: The two cases you present are more or less covered by the guess $V(k) = A + B \frac{k^{1-\sigma}}{1 - \sigma}$ since this reduces to logs as $\sigma \rightarrow 1$. The guesses are certainly tied to the particular form of the return function as the value function is related to the one period return (reward) function repeatedly obtained throughout an infinite history (if consumption were constant then it would reduce to a geometric sum). 

In a previous version of my answer, I wasn't careful in how I thought about and explained these ideas and I have clarified a few ideas in my head since then which hopefully translates to a clarified answer. Now to answer your question: We have an urn with 60 balls. We are uncertain about the number of black balls and yellow balls in this urn. Imagine we present this urn with the above specified lotteries to an individual (with a monotonic utility function $u$) and ask them to choose between $L_{A'}$ and $L_{B'}$. Without loss of generality, imagine they choose to take $L_{A'}$. This tells us by revealed preference $L_{A'} \succ L_{B'}$ which then implies $$u(30) > u(B)$$ where $B$ is the number of black balls that are believed to be in the urn (no probabilities here, this is some number the decision maker arrived at and at this point we don't know how). This implies $$B < 30$$ Now imagine that you give the agent the choice between $L_{C'}$ and $L_{D'}$ and the agent chooses to face lottery $D'$. Then $$u(60) > u(30 + (60-B))$$ where $(60-B)$ is the number of yellow balls that the agent must think are in the urn. This implies $$60 > 30 + (60-B) \Rightarrow B > 30$$ This means that an agent cannot prefer $L_{A'}$ to $L_{B'}$ and prefer $L_{C'}$ to $L_{D'}$ because that would imply $B > 30$ and $B < 30$. It is difficult to talk about where $B$ comes from because it is a hard concept to think about when we are used to working in expected value terms, this agent cannot compute any type of expectation over the sets of values that he thinks $B$ lies in. As an example of this, let me use a max-min approach. Imagine that when he is presented the urn and lotteries that he is told that the number of black balls is either 15 or 45, but the agent doesn't know with what probability it is 15 and what probability it is 45. 

Your first quote makes it clear that "thymology" is a wilfully abstruse word for psychology (though it's unclear why only male psychology is considered). And psychology has been part of economics for as long as economics has been discussed. You can find psychology in Adam Smith and Aristotle. There was something of a barren period within the twentieth century when some economists disregarded psychology, but taking a historical perspective of the study of economics, that was a temporary aberration. 

The average cost is the cost on average: total costs (C) divided by total number of units of production (q). Just as the equation you gave, says The marginal cost is the cost at the margin: the additional cost of one extra unit of production, just as the equation you gave, says. Most goods and services come in discrete units: in those cases, it is not about infinitesimals, it is about the last unit of production, the unit that was produced to meet demand, the unit that would not have been produced had demand been one unit lower. In cases of continuous supply, the marginal cost is the gradient of the curve of total cost plotted with respect to total supply. In pretty much all real-world circumstances, marginal cost is generally greater than average cost: that's guaranteed by a strictly monotonically increasing supply curve (with the trivial exception of the first unit of production, where average cost is by definition equal to marginal cost). 

thus he chooses lottery $A'$. Now consider $L_{C'}$ and $L_{D'}$. He thinks these lotteries will pay 

thus he would choose lottery $D'$. This is one example of how uncertainty can be treated in a problem like this, but by no means is the only. Note: Earlier I thought had a piece of my answer that talked about priors over the value of $B$, but this wasn't carefully thought through. You can have multiple values that you might imagine $B$ takes, but as soon as you assign a probability distribution to any of these values then you have left the realm of uncertainty and moved to the realm of risk. 

This is a result of firm maximization. Consider a problem that a profit maximizing firm faces --it must rent capital, $k$, at rate $r$ and hires labor, $l$, at wage $w$ to produce goods ($F(k, l)$) for which we can sell at a normalized price of 1. $$ \max_{k, l} F(k, l) - w l - r k $$ Then if we just think about the firm's maximization, we can take derivatives w.r.t $k$ and $l$ to get: $$ F_k(k, l) - r = 0 $$ $$ F_k(k, l) = r $$ and $$ F_l(k, l) - w = 0 $$ $$ F_l(k, l) = w $$ Notice that by definition $MPL_K = F_k(k, l)$ and $MP_L = F_l(k, l)$. If we take the ratio of the two equations then we get what you initially introduced --that is: $$ \frac{F_l(k, l)}{F_k(k, l)} = \frac{MP_L}{MP_K} = \frac{w}{r} $$ Edit: As mentioned in another answer, this is imposing some assumptions on the behavior of $F(k, l)$. These assumptions are $\frac{\partial F}{\partial k} > 0$, $\frac{\partial F}{\partial l} > 0$ and $\frac{\partial^2 F}{\partial k^2} < 0$ $\frac{\partial^2 F}{\partial l^2} < 0$ 

Here's an example from the Business Case Development Manual used for evaluating costs and benefits for transport schemes in Greater London, page E-10, showing a penalty just for the interchange itself of 3.5 minutes of travel time. That's in addition to valuing the waiting and walking time at the interchange: 

You've identified the first-order effect: the supply of local currency has increased, so its price (and from the perspective of other currencies, that's its exchange rate) decreases. That's assuming that the move wasn't already (fully) priced-in by the market. There are lots of other effects. There will be a change in domestic interest rates. The particular rates affected, depend on which debt has been bought. And there will be knock-on effects in those markets. This may affect inward investment in those markets. QE in itself sends a couple of signals to the market. Firstly, that the Bank sees deflationary pressures a year or two ahead (assuming its mandate is an inflation-rate target); and secondly, that it intends to apply inflationary pressure to deal with it. The market will react to those signals, depending on how far they diverge from what the market had already anticipated. Those reactions might include increased optimism or pessimism about future domestic demand, and / or about the health of domestic industries, and that can have an affect on exchange rates. In short, the central bank is pressing levers that touch on much of the macro-economic picture, so there are lots of second-order effects. The nature and direction of these effects will depend on expectations before and after the announcement, as well as what's actually going on in the economy.
