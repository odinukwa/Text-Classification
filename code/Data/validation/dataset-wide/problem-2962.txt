To say the opposite of something, we need a base to stand on. And to say the opposite of that base, again we need another base to stand on. And also there must be something that is different from the base. For instance let's take 'hot' and 'cold'. Both these words are adjectives and are used for comparing temperatures. Since these two are of the same category and is also possible to say a word that differentiates some properties, we can say one word is the opposite of the other. But this is not the case of consciousness. Consciousness is the base of everything. Only those who realized the Ultimate truth know that consciousness is pure, unique and undivided. But usually our ego creates boundaries and we live safely in it believing that there are myriads of consciousnesses. Since consciousness is the base of everything it (my consciousness) has no opposite. P.S. [Since there is a higher level of understanding, from a lower level we can say 'consciousness is the base'. To understand anything consciousness is a must. But from a higher level many great men have realized that 'there is nothing beyond/other than consciousness'. So they didn't even need to use the word 'base'. I think there is no difficulty in believing that consciousness is pure. The difficulty occurs in the next two words only...i.e. "it is unique and undivided". If one can believe that consciousness is pure, he can also say it has no opposite. If there is a thing that is absolutely pure, it won't have an opposite...In other words, the word we found out must have moved from its level. But to realize that purity, one must 'go' beyond the imagination of particles. You may try to find out the opposite of 'Pure consciousness'. People may say its opposite is 'Impure consciousness'. But to become impure it must move from its level. That means these two have no common base to confirm that one is the opposite of the other. But one can argue linguistically.] See this reference Vivekananda also gave importance to consciousness: 

The authority to stop such issues are also responsible for these. Then whose behavior would you blame/name first? Here we can see at least three persons: 

Sometimes knowing the truth at improper time will create problems. But on some occasions one should know the truth as early as possible. So we would be able to act only after understanding the real situation. We should try to maintain the relationship with good people. (Only if you are quite sure you know the truth) On certain occasions if we are good we (or if I am good I) should relinquish the relationship for the wellbeing of the other person. Later, when the other person realizes the truth, that relationship will/may become purer than before. On some occasions we would feel not to keep on the relationship for the wellbeing of both persons. In such cases also, we will have to relinquish the relationship. Usually, the answer to this question depends on the need and strength of the relationship, the seriousness of the truth and the characters of both persons. So, one specific answer would create problems to both persons. That is, in some cases you would be compelled to keep silent even though it is unsuitable there. But relationship with bad people should be avoided. So, in such cases you need not remain silent. You can speak the truth directly or indirectly without fearing anything. If the speaker's (friend's) side is wrong, with a few words one can divert his thoughts to another direction to help him think better and avoid making the relationship unpleasant. So, silence is not the only option here. 

You didn't mention what is meant by the term-- 'improving myself'. Different people have different aims according to their philosophy. But those who could understand the potentialities of human have clearly mentioned about it. The inquiry of human will not stop until he realizes himself clearly. Then only one can understand clearly what that term means. If one could realize himself he would explain that term in a different way. I don't wish to mention it...please 'listen' to Vivekananda. Swami Vivekanada says: 

You may ask them about any fact/truth (which all the three men are familiar with) according to the situation. But the questions must be the same and the right answers must be "Yes/No" only. Approach each man and ask pointing to the other two about both of their replies if he asked them whether they are policemen?" Since this question is about two persons, he must get two answers from each person. But Mr Y will be compelled to reply to one part only. See the table given below Conclusion (for a verification): He who says "Not sure" (about one person), is Mr X. He who keeps mum in the case of one person, is Mr Y. He who says "Yes" and/or "No" only, is Mr Z. For analysis, let us consider this question (to each man). "would you tell me both of their replies if I asked them whether they are policemen?" Suppose this question has two right answers--Yes/No. Then each man will quote the possible responses of the other two men. So, response of the speaker about himself is not applicable. [See the table.] 

.........says Ramana Maharshi. That means, prayer is not necessary even to realize the Self. But certainly prayer helps to pacify the mind and makes the process easier. 

Almost all of us solve many problems we face in our life according to some philosophies. If your question is not in a broad sense, in most people's case it is a waste of time; but not in the case of born philosophers. Some people have only good capacity for work rather than thinking capacity. This also has a great importance in each individual's development as well as the development of humanity. Heating up brain unnecessarily is not a good tendency. (Sri Ramakrishna discouraged excessive use of philosophy.) If one can use philosophy wisely for eliminating his ego, it can be used as a ladder for reaching or attaining Self realization. See teachings of Ramana Maharshi: $URL$ 

If you wish to cease to be you, this question is a twisted form about self realization. There is no such change. Since you have already explained yourself, I need not explain it further. That changeless 'thing' (not a nothingness) is you. You need not (actually you can't) cease to be you; since it (the very thing you mentioned) is not moving. Also it has not a beginning. The process is a kind of unveiling. I would say, "It is the releasing of our 'inflated ego'." The things that cease are your mind and the Ego. 

Reincarnation is applicable not to selected persons only. It is applicable to each and every creature. But this fact becomes evident very rarely. Refer : Reincarnation [Please note: Reincarnation is not the Ultimate Truth] Almost all people don't like to / can't "look into" themselves to know exactly who they are. Many factors distort their path. Actually the person who says truly, that he had a past life, is from self-evidence. 

Keeping silent, speaking the truth and telling a lie, all these three actions can make bad effects if you don't use your power of discrimination wisely according to the situation. I shall instance for a confusing idea only: When we take a person to hospital after a serious injury or a snakebite, we often lie to the victim to reduce his anxiety, pulse rate etc. Here we must tell a lie to save him. In this case truth or silence can't save him. Doctors also do this on many occasions. Mishap (death) happened to a beloved person is not often informed 'directly'. In courts some witnesses tell lies to save the accused. I need not explain why this is wrong. We shouldn't forget that even while keeping silent, we can convey approval or disapproval with different facial expressions. 

As mentioned in one of the comments, you should first search for 'different' Gods on different websites and select each God and verify whether there is anything irrational in all those Gods. After that, you could choose one 'Rational God' and ask this question. Otherwise it'd become a beat around the bush. If you choose one or more things as the idea or concept of God, you will have to regard all the other things as the idea or concept of another God. [We can't rule out the possibility of another God or gods (since there are many similar creations or concepts in this world)]. Which God would you choose then for this question? If you choose one particular idea, concept, category or religion only as the concept of God, that would also become a folly....since the supplement for that concept and the complement of that concept must be of another God's. Then also there must be another God or gods. So, when we think of an (external) creator of ideas or concepts (God), some contradictions pop up. We perceive this world through our senses. Knowingly or unknowingly we admit only the things perceived through our 5 sense organs (Some forms of lights, sounds, smells etc that we can't perceive with our sense organs are amplified or transformed in another form. But they also are for helping these senses only.) The senses, brain etc create a feeling that there is creation here. Five is a small number. What about the situation if the number of our sense organs were below or above five? Then, would our understanding be like this...? Actually, we can't even imagine such a situation. If you can imagine these senses, brain etc as somebody's creations, ideas or concepts, you will have to search their bases also. This is not possible with your senses. The things, ideas and concepts that we understand with our mortal sense organs and brain are never the Ultimate Truth. So, if you believe (this logic) or not, you will have to assume that there is no creation. When you realize yourself you will understand whether there is any real creation here. Then you wouldn't need to ask this question. 

Without investigating the whereabouts we usually help the victims who are hospitalized after serious injuries. Giving first aid is certainly humane. I consider this act as one such thing. I mean accommodating refugees is ethical. But the unethical side (Since generosity is an additional quality, here I would like to treat it as non-ethical) I could find is on the free housing and substantial financial pay which regular citizens don't get. My opinion is, since there are many thousands of homeless starving people in your country, the Government. should conduct a referendum before giving such financial help. But I am not against the immediate financial help they were given for their survival. If there were few homeless starving people in your country I would consider it as a great act. 

Any knowledge, if it is not transformed as wisdom, has a great deal of disadvantages. Scientific mind is one such thing. If you are not using your scientific mind to imagine your fellow beings' feelings, most often it would not be helpful to your mental development. If your scientific mind is up to a certain level only, you may ask like this: "I can't see others' mind. There is no such thing. Scientists also can't discover any such thing. So why should I care for it? Why should I care for others' feelings?" If you are affected by 'scientific mania' a great deal, you won't be ready to venture into any kind of risk. Since there is no proof before you, you can't believe most ideas others say. You might have noticed that those who don't give much importance to scientific mind living happily while those who give, unhappily. Again, if you rely on your scientific mind only.... 

Before asking about connections, you could ask this question to yourself: "For the growth and development of brains do the things needed for it have any connection?" If not possible, again my humble reply is about self realization. Or you may google and find what great Non-dualists who realized the truth have said about it. 

Sometimes. One person's moral philosophy and another person's moral philosophy may be different. And when these philosophies begin to fight each other because of some campaign, what you regarded as moral, will disappear. So one can discuss your beliefs with other persons. But when it (the discussion) turns into a campaign, its approach also changes. For instance, you may think of the approaches of religions. What will happen if each believer (or all the believers) begins to campaign vigorously to establish/convince their own beliefs? So I would say it depends on the seriousness of the issue and your ability. Your belief may be wrong and it would create problems to you also if you insisted someone of doing a mistake. You may verify what Lord Krishna said after revealing even the greatest secret of life. See chapter 18. Verse 63. If the problem is serious and you are unable to campaign you should find some means to overcome your inability. The following answer is suitable to this particular problem only. It is the duty of the Govt. to launch programs, take stern decisions etc. for the common good. Only if you are a divergent thinker (I mean, a good philosopher), inform the government about all the possible pros and cons of that program and also mention which one is better and make a request for a clarification to them if it is against your opinions. If you are sure that that clarification is irrational, YOU ARE OBLIGED to convince others depending on its seriousness especially if it will badly affect the security of the nation, coming generation etc. It is the duty of a citizen to save the nation from any kind of latent menace if he knows one such. If it is apparent, you need not worry. The people will do it for the country. [I don't wish to use the word--'morally', because in any way you are obliged to do so.] Here a good govt. also have a duty to convince the people of their present opinion about the program mentioning all the possible doubts of the people. A referendum should be conducted only after giving clarification by the government. Since wise people are less there would be a great chance of taking wrong decision by the Govt and it will become a smoldering problem in the country. 'Your' Govt might not have done this properly. This might be the reason why you thought of a campaign. You may read the following verses from the Bhagavad Gita (Chapter 18) and think whether there is any touch of morality in doing the activity you mentioned in your question. verse 59 verse 60 verse 61 

You are right. It will kill the self image that you misunderstood that it is strictly related to your body as in a delusion. But you need not fear of some great loss. Please listen to Sri Ramana Maharshi's parable of salt doll. 

$URL$ This means, the subject itself is the foundation of philosophy. When each subject ends, its philosophy begins. 

2. If this question is about conventional truth, it is not always useful. But it depends on your character, aim of life etc. How would you feel if you could see people in their 'real form' -- as an embodiment of organisms, blood, feces, urine etc.? Truth realization will change your character and will feel as if a new person were born again (without physical death). If you are not ready to change your character even a little and if you don't wish to 'know' your real nature, it won't be useful. But if you ask "Really useful?" I would say, "Yes". [If I am asked again--"Really?", I would keep mum because the Ultimate Reality is beyond usefulness and uselessness. Since this answer (the last one) is useful to a few people only, a truth-seeker must ignore this. Refer this quote (given in the following link)--“There is neither creation nor destruction, neither destiny nor free will, neither path nor achievement.This is the final truth.”] If you are not 'mature' (used in another sense) to face the truth, that will create problems. That was why I said so--'not always'. You will get an idea about where to focus from these words of Ramana Maharshi. Truth cannot be quantified. But we can 'view' truth from different levels; with reference to another (relatively).[i.e.,considering another one is true.] 

We all know about the use of fishing hook. And it is used only by humans. I am saying about this just for reminding you of cheating by showing or giving a bait. It is some people's habit to cheat others for gaining something. Certainly, some animals also cheat; but only for their food. So it is very important to know the danger behind every action and act accordingly. Otherwise you would be cheated. But humans, since they have five powerful sense organs, it is very easy to get trapped if they don't use their intelligence/power of discrimination. We need not use this (our power of discrimination) much if we consider immediate pleasure only. So majority of people consider immediate pleasure irrational. All the developments we see now are because humans most often abstain from this type of things and activities. You may think over it. And this has great significance especially if one's aim is finding out the truth of something/truth realization. Even though you have no such aims you may think how all humans would behave if all are pursuing immediate pleasure only. Though useful, sense organs are sometimes deceptive.
