It would in theory combine some of the characteristics of both, while permitting a cheaper bike than straight carbon. The aluminum could be thinner, providing only modest strength but serving as a mandrel to support the carbon, and the carbon would produce a stiffer bike than straight aluminum. Or it could just be hype. Or the "carbon wrap" could be used to conceal crummy joining of the aluminum tubes. 

You can ride all day with, say, Shimano SPD mountain pedals and medium-priced compatible shoes. It is true, though, that, towards the end of that day, you will experience some discomfort from the narrow pedal and the way it effectively traps your foot in the shoe (leading to a "hot foot" sensation), vs the wider platform of a road pedal. Probably stiffer shoes will moderate this somewhat, but at the expense of being less "walkable". Still, for me "mountain" pedals are the way to go - inexpensive, double-sided (easy to clip into), walkable shoes, et al. But I'm nowhere near a competitive rider, and have no desire to be. 

There are others I'm not thinking of at the moment. And this question is likely a dupe and there are other threads with more info. 

Note that gearing is often described in "gear inches". This odd term is a little hard to explain unless you understand that it originates from the old "penny-farthing" bicycles with the small rear wheel and the big front wheel, with the pedals directly attached to the front wheel. With such a bike, the larger the front wheel diameter, the faster you traveled for a given pedaling "cadence" (but the harder it was to pedal). So the front wheel diameter determined the "gear ratio". With a modern chain-driven bike a given combination of front and rear sprockets combined with the diameter of the rear (drive) wheel will produce a gear ratio that is expressed in "gear inches". Basically, that "gear inch" number is the same as the diameter of the penny-farthing front wheel that would travel the same distance with one turn of the pedals. (And the larger the "gear inch" number the faster you go at a given pedal cadence, but the harder it is to pedal.) 

Clean them. I'd avoid using any sort of solvent, as it would be bad for the pads and might simply make things worse. First undo the noodle so you can access the face of the pads, then wipe pads and rims thoroughly. Scrub pads and rims with a dab of detergent on a rag, then hose down to remove the detergent. Reattach noodle. (I always forget that part.) The brakes will likely still be a bit "slippery", but riding with the brakes partially engaged for a minute or two should bring things back to normal. 

One point that seemed to be missed in the answers so far (though I'll admit I didn't read every word) is that indexed shifters are only a small part of indexed shifting. It used to be that you needed friction shifters because, in order to shift to a larger sprocket, you had to "over-shift" substantially -- push the lever beyond the point where it would eventually end up, then move it back once the chain had begun to move. Because of this, indexed shifting was essentially impossible, even though it was no doubt a sought-after goal of many inventors. What changed was the chain and sprockets, with carefully-engineered profiles that would cause the chain to "climb" the sprocket if it was pushed ever so slightly in that direction. This invention made indexed shifting possible, and largely eliminated shifting as a major roadblock in the way of a "mass market" for bikes. But, rather incidentally, the change to chain and sprocket profiles made possible shifting under load, something that was largely impossible before. While many of us would willingly give up indexed shifting (I miss the sensation of the lever that allowed me to inherently know what gear I is in), how many would be happy to give up being able to shift under load? 

For degreasing I don't think it's that important to use a bicycle-specific product -- any reputable "parts degreaser" from a hardware store or auto parts place should suffice. I would recommend avoiding "do all" cleaner/degreasers that claim to wash your dishes and do your laundry as well. Stick to a "parts degreaser" or something of that ilk. And, of course, thoroughly wipe dry the chain after cleaning, and relube with an appropriate chain lube. Here using a bike-specific product is somewhat more critical. 

You can buy the seat-post-mounted mini-racks from a number of sources, and, once you have one of those, any small bag can be attached with bungies. Another option is a bag that straps to the rails under the seat. Most often these are used for tools, but some of larger ones (such as this Ortleib bag) may suit your needs. 

Yep, that tire needs to be replaced. (It appears that either it's been run underinflated or you've been using your foot on the side of the tire to brake a lot.) 

Unless the frame is unusually valuable, it is almost never "worth it" to buy new major parts, such as a new rear wheel (with cluster, et al). A new rear wheel, once you've got the sprockets and tire on it, will cost in excess of $100, and could run $200-300 if you're determined to find "equivalent" parts. Likewise for a bike missing a fork, a crank assembly, etc. You can, however, get a pretty good deal using salvaged parts, either salvaging them yourself (from other scrapped bikes) or buying them from bike shops that are into this sort of thing. I spent this afternoon helping to turn 4 broken bikes into 2 good ones, for the local school system. 

What is your "cadence" (number of pedal revolutions per minute)? A healthy young cyclist should be able to "cruise" at 80-90 rpm, and that would be considered your top speed. If at 80 rpm you're only getting 18kmph (11mph) in your fastest gear then your bike gearing is quite low and you probably need to change something. But many novice cyclists simply pedal too slowly. With a multi-speed bike you should focus first on getting a "reasonable" cadence (maybe 60 rpm when "taking it easy", 80-90 when trying to go fast). "Gear down" into an easier gear until you learn to maintain cadence, then slowly increase gear difficulty to gain strength and stamina. 

Note that it may be that some countries, particularly in Europe, have subsidized prices for bicycles, or, at the very least, artificially low import tariffs. (I don't personally know of any, however.) 

How many days do you have for the tour? Just about anyone (including my polio self) can do 60 miles (100 km) in a day, so long as there aren't too many hills and there isn't a bad headwind. Rain will slow you down (and can make the ride miserable) but won't stop you unless it's very heavy or the weather is especially cold. (Hail, on the other hand, can stop you.) 100 miles a day (160 km) is reasonable for someone who is fairly well trained, if the weather and hills cooperate. And most people who aren't quite so well trained can do that distance "unreasonably" if pressed. Hydration isn't necessarily a big deal. You should have at least two 16 oz water bottles (readily accessible), which you fill several times a day. You don't need more unless you'll be far from civilization or riding in unusually hot conditions. Drink before you're thirsty. Get in the habit of taking a swig every 10 minutes or so. For maintenance you need mainly tire repair tools and a multi-purpose tool made for bikes. For first aid a few Band-Aids, some antibiotic ointment, maybe some gauze and tape. And your water bottle (for washing off wounds). Your likely injuries are minor cuts from sharp edges of the bike plus "road rash". Also have sun lotion and bug spray. And some hydrocortisone ointment is nice to have for bug bites and "butt burn". Precautions: Wear a helmet!!! Nothing wrong with that bike, for such a short trip. Just keep the tires inflated to the max sidewall pressure. If you were biking across the US you might want something different. 

Hot asphalt can be in the neighborhood of 200F, and contains some fairly volatile oils. It's probably safe to ride a few hundred feet on the stuff, but I'd avoid anything longer, especially with lightweight tires. 

Some (many) tubes are made to fit too wide a range of tire sizes and will tend to be a bit on the long side inside some tires. One should make a point to only inflate the tube enough to fill it out before installing (so as not to stretch it further), then make sure during installation that it's not buckled or doubled on itself at any point inside the tire. If the tube is buckled/doubled anywhere not only will you have a "lump" while riding, you'll also have a flat tire in a few dozen miles of riding. 

There are unfortunately a dozen different things that can go wrong. First on the list, as mentioned, is over-tightened cones. But beyond that it's easy to get a spacer in the wrong place to that, eg, the freehub rubs against the hub body, or you can simply get a foreign object (eg a washer) jammed in between components somewhere. 

The difference is in the lubricant. Ball bearings need to be lubricated with a sort of grease. This grease is in your wheel hubs and also in your pedal bearings. The grease is gooey. Gooeyness means that some very small amount of energy is consumed as the stuff moves around. You don't notice this energy loss on a wheel because wheels have a lot of momentum, so that overrides the tiny amount of energy lost in the grease. But pedals are often incredibly light, and, lacking much momentum, it does not take much drag from the grease to make them stop spinning. The lighter the pedal (and good quality pedals tend to be lighter), the greater the effect -- the pedal slows down from spinning faster. There is also the point that better quality pedals contain bearings with closer tolerances, and the lubricant effect is stronger with tighter tolerances. (And, truth be told, some cheap pedals are not lubricated from the factory, other than perhaps a squirt of oil.) But lest one be concerned about this minuscule energy loss, know that, as you pedal, the grease warms up and softens up significantly, reducing the loss even further. 

Well, probably the first thing to ask yourself is whether this is a "utilitarian" purchase, or this is your "muscle car" -- intended as much for show as for use. There's nothing wrong with either, if you have the money and are clear on your motives, but the difference will definitely affect your choices. Eg, for "utilitarian" purposes (ie, you actually intend to ride the bike frequently for long rides at high speeds) the Craig's List bike (if you can find a suitable one) is ideal, but for a "muscle car" you want a bike that is, if not new, at least spotless and "showy". For "utilitarian" you don't need carbon frame or fancy wheels, but for "muscle car" those are "show points". Added From your update it would appear that you're not (necessarily) interested in a "showy" bike but more the utilitarian one. If you're going to be doing 100 mile rides you need some comfort and durability. You probably don't want a bike that you must treat with kid gloves. Fit, comfort, and durability should be your priorities. (Any quality road bike will be light enough that the weight doesn't matter.) 

Obviously, the simpler the better, and a triple is a little, er, "crankier" to maintain and use than a double. But on most bikes it will mean that you have both a slightly larger large gear and a significantly smaller small gear, in addition to having closer "jumps" between gears. Exactly how this all will work out depends on the manufacturer's choice of sprockets, of course (or on your choice of after-market replacements). Though bicycle snobs may turn up their noses at triples, there's very little wrong with them and a lot that's "right". The only two negatives are a slight increase in difficulty shifting the front derailer (minimized with properly adjusted indexed shifters) and the negligible additional weight. 

In general, you won't see kickstands on more expensive bikes. The primary reason is that a standard kickstand that mounts to the chain stays just behind the BB simply won't fit. Beyond that, the standard kickstand will often not reliably support a bike, and it's better to lay down a bike than have it fall down. There's also the problem that the standard kickstand often interferes with pedaling. There are better-designed kickstands (2-3 different designs) that mount differently and which more reliably support the bike. You will occasionally see these on touring bikes. But they're quite hard to find (and of course would not work on fiber and probably AL bikes). 

It's been my experience, rehabbing bikes for "Christmas Anonymous" and other charities, that steel wheels do not maintain "true" as well as aluminum wheels. (I've no ideas why this is the case, but I've definitely seen it.) Beyond that, steel does not brake as well with rim brakes. And, of course, aluminum is apt to be "siphoned off" for separate recycling as a higher value metal. 

Clean and oil the chain regularly. A "chain washer" (about $30) is good for cleaning while making minimal mess. Since you have to store your bike outside, use "wet" chain lube (at least in rainy season). Buy yourself an inexpensive "chain wear indicator" for about $10. Replace the chain when it's stretched to about 0.8, and, when you replace it, check your cogs to see how worn they are. (The Park Tool site likely gives some hints as to how to check for cog wear.) Visually check your brake blocks every now and then (assuming rim brakes), and replace before the metal part comes close to touching the rim. Occasionally inspect your cables for fraying or excessive rust, and replace if indicated. As the bike is stored outside, occasionally put a few drops of lube on the cables where the inner cables slide into the outer housings. Occasionally inspect your tires for wear, and for cracks in the sidewalls that indicate they are "drying out". (And, of course, get a good "floor pump" with built-in gauge and check your tire pressure at least weekly.)
