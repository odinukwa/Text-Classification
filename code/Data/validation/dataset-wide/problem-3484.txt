There is no such thing as the "Coasian bargaining solution". This is a simple principle according to which parties find an agreement somewhere on the Pareto frontier when they bargain, which means that the outcome of the bargaining process is socially efficient (abstracting from equity issues). The Nash bargaining solution refines our predictions by specifying where the solution is likely to be located on the Pareto frontier. In some sense, it is a subset of the Coasian bargaining outcome, which can be anywhere on the Pareto frontier. In contrast to the Coase principle, it is a theorem that rests on an axiomatic characterization. 

Here is a proof by induction on $n$, for any $(n,m) \in \mathbb{N}^2$. We will need the following preliminary result, which strengthens the assumption on $\succeq$: Lemma \begin{equation*} \forall x,y,z \in \mathbb{R}, x \succ y \Rightarrow x+z \succ y + z \end{equation*} Proof Suppose that $x+z \preceq y+z$. By your assumption on $\succeq$, we can add $-z$ to both sides of this inequality (since $-z \in X=\mathbb{R}$) and obtain \begin{equation*} x+z+(-z) \preceq y+z+(-z) \end{equation*} i.e. $x \preceq y$. This proves the lemma (by contrapositive). Now, let us prove the main result. 

You are right, total is a synonym for complete, it simply means that two elements can always be compared. Regarding your other point, I don't think that your definitions of strict order and weak order are common but they make perfect sense. Notice, however, that they differ from some definitions used by mathematicians and therefore you have to specify what you are talking about to avoid possible confusions (you can check for instance "strict weak ordering"). 

I am interested in the debate about affirmative action in college admissions and I would be happy to read some theoretical economic investigations of the effects of these policies. I would be glad if someone could point out a good and recent survey of this literature, or some papers addressing this issue. The following two questions are of particular interest to me: 

Confirmation bias is somewhat different to the behavior you are describing. This expression describes the attitude of a researcher who interprets ambiguous data as confirming his initial hypothesis. For instance, researchers who believe that death penalty has a deterrent effect on crime would interpret any additional dataset as confirming this theory, whereas researchers who believe the opposite would interpret the same evidence as indicating that the effect is null. The behavior that you describe might be called "post hoc analysis" or "post hoc theorizing". Scientific standards in experimental economics have been improving recently to mitigate this bias (among other mistakes/misbehavior). For instance, many researchers who do randomized controlled trials in development economics now pre-register their analysis plan (and even sometimes a theory with its predictions) before collecting the data: by doing so, they commit to a list of statistical tests that they will run, which prevents them from changing their theory/hypotheses (and even the question of interest) after looking at the data. Of course, as @denesp mentions, this cannot generally be done with observational data, except maybe in situations where the researchers need to go through an approval procedure to get access to the data, in which case a pre-registration of the analysis plan might be imposed as part of the application. 

Because $x$ is not a constant, and therefore multiplying $U(x,y)$ by $x$ does not necessarily preserve the ordering between bundles. For instance, consider the function $U(x,y)=x+y$, and the bundles $(x_0,y_0)=(2,0)$ and $(x_1,y_1)=(1,2)$. We have \begin{equation*} U(x_0,y_0)=2 < U(x_1,y_1)=3 \end{equation*} but \begin{equation*} x_0 U(x_0,y_0) = 4 > x_1 U(x_1,y_1) = 3 \end{equation*} Hence multiplying $U$ by $x$ changes the preferences, therefore is not a monotonic transformation. As a side note, multiplying the utility function by a constant provides a monotonic transformation if the constant is positive, and not only nonnegative as you assumed (if the constant is zero the orderings are obviously not preserved). 

The first-order condition would be satisfied under the assumption $c=G(l)$ if $U'(0)=0$. But this latter requirement is incompatible with the assumptions: indeed, $U'$ is nonincreasing (by the concavity of $U$) which yields $U'(x) \leq 0$ for any $x \geq 0$, which contradicts the fact that $U$ is increasing. If $U'(x)>0$ for all $x$, the only possibility to meet the first-order condition is indeed $\dfrac{dc}{dl}=G'(l)$. 

The MRS is a function of $x$ and $y$. The fact that $y$ doesn't appear in the formula simply means that this function is constant in $y$. The linearity does not imply indifference. It means that an additional value of $y$ is valued equally by the agent irrespective of his baseline consumption. In your example, this contrasts with the marginal utility of consuming $x$ which is decreasing with the baseline consumption since the function $u$ is concave in $x$. 

This expression is used for the arguments of the utility function, that is, for the objects the agent "cares about". In the canonical model, the only carrier of utility is wealth, but in behavioral economics a lot of things can be considered (beliefs, wealth compared to a reference point, ...). For instance, saying that the carrier of utility for John is the difference between John's wealth and Lisa's wealth means that the utility function of John is of the form $u(x-y)$ where $x$ is John's wealth and $y$ is Lisa's wealth. It is another way of saying that the only thing that matters to John is his relative wealth compared to Lisa, and not his absolute wealth. 

As Dave Harris' points out in his comment, I assume that your question deals with events that do not compromise the individual's ability to work, which would prevent her from taking on debt. Let's take the example of a fire which happens with probability $\pi \in [0,1]$. The damage of a fire equals $D$ dollars, i.e. it costs $D$ dollars to repair the house. If the individual buys full insurance at a price $p$ she ends up with a final wealth equal to $w-p$ in all contingencies since the insurance company covers the damages. Suppose now that she does not buy any insurance but contracts a loan to cover the damages. In order to repair the house she has to borrow $D$ dollars. This loan costs her $D'$ dollars over her lifetime, taking into account the interest and her time preferences (discounting). She then ends up with final wealth equal to 

I use the usual notation $(\succeq,\succ,\sim)$ instead of $R$. I assume that $X_{\sim}$ in your question is the set of equivalence classes of $\sim$ on $X$. Suppose that the cardinality of $X_{\sim}$ is equal to $n \geq 1$. There exist $x_1\cdots,x_n$ such that $x_1 \prec \cdots \prec x_n$. Define $v(x_1)=1,v(x_2)=2,\cdots,v (x_n)=n$. Since $\sim$ has $n$ equivalence classes, for any $y \notin \{x_1,\cdots,x_n\}$ there exists a unique $x \in \{x_1,\cdots,x_n\}$ such that $y \sim x$. Define $v (y)=v(x)$. The function $v$ defined on $X$ takes values in $\mathbb{N}$. I leave it to you to check that $v$ is a utility representation of $\succeq $. 

Fix indeed the payment $w$. The problem can be written \begin{equation*} \max_{w'}{u(x'-w')p(a')} \end{equation*} given the constraints \begin{align*} & w'p(a') \geq 1 - w[1-p(a')] \\ & w'[p(a')-p(a)] \geq 1+w[p(a')-p(a)] \end{align*} It is clear that the principal has interest to set the lowest possible value for $w'$ given this set of constraint, since the objective function is decreasing in $w'$. Therefore he will set \begin{equation} w' = \max\{\frac{1-w[1-p(a')]}{p(a')},\frac{1+w[p(a')-p(a)]}{p(a')-p(a)}\} \end{equation} As @Alecos_Papadopoulos did, it makes sense to assume that the agent is protected by limited liability, i.e. that his payments are nonnegative. Otherwise the problem does not necessarily have a solution: the principal could always benefit from decreasing $w$ and increasing $w'$ so as to keep the individual rationality constraint satisfied. But the contract $(w=-\infty,w'=+\infty)$ is obviously not a satisfactory solution. Therefore I restrict attention to the case where $w \geq 0$ and $w' \geq 0$. The condition $w \geq 0$ implies \begin{equation*} \dfrac{1+w[p(a')-p(a)]}{p(a')-p(a)} \geq \dfrac{1-w[1-p(a')]}{p(a')} \end{equation*} and therefore \begin{equation*} w' = \dfrac{1+w[p(a')-p(a)]}{p(a')-p(a)} \end{equation*} Plugging this equation into the objective function, the principal's problem becomes \begin{equation*} \max_{w \geq 0}{u(x'-\frac{1}{p(a')-p(a)}-w)p(a')+u(x-w)(1-p(a'))} \end{equation*} This objective function is decreasing in $w$. Therefore he simply sets $w=0$ and $w'=\dfrac{1}{p(a')-p(a)}$. As a conclusion, the equality $x'-w'=x-w$ has no reason to be satisfied unless one assumes that $x'-x=\dfrac{1}{p(a')-p(a)}$, i.e. that \begin{equation*} p(a') x' + (1-p(a'))x -1= p(a)x' + (1-p(a))x \end{equation*} This latter equation means that the social surplus resulting from $a'$ equals the surplus resulting from $a$: it is a very particular case where the cost of effort for the agent is exactly compensated by the increase in expected output for the principal. In all other cases, we have $x'-w' \ne x-w$. I think the reason why the agent does not take on all the risk is because his actions are not observable, and therefore not contractible upon. This property would be true in a risk-sharing economy with unconstrained allocations. But the allocation is here distorted by the need to incentivize the agent to exert a high effort. 

You can separate your function in three terms by writing \begin{align} & v(c_{t+\Delta},u_{t+\Delta},t+\Delta)-v(c_t,u_t,t) = \\ & v(c_{t+\Delta},u_{t+\Delta},t+\Delta)-v(c_t,u_{t+\Delta},t+\Delta) \\ + & v(c_{t},u_{t+\Delta},t+\Delta)-v(c_t,u_t,t+\Delta) \\ + & v(c_t,u_t,t+\Delta)-v(c_t,u_t,t) \end{align} When you divide by $\Delta$ and take the limit $\Delta \rightarrow 0$, the first expression converges to $\dfrac{\partial v}{\partial c} \dfrac{dc}{dt}$, the second expression to $\dfrac{\partial v}{\partial u} \dfrac{du}{dt}$, and the third expression to $\dfrac{\partial v}{\partial t}$. Therefore your total derivative equals \begin{equation} \dfrac{\partial v}{\partial c} \dfrac{dc}{dt} + \dfrac{\partial v}{\partial u} \dfrac{du}{dt} + \dfrac{\partial v}{\partial t} \end{equation} 

The value of $h(g(f(u(x,y))$ is not necessarily positive but the transformation $u \rightarrow h \circ g \circ f \circ u$ is indeed a positive monotone transformation. To see this, take any $(x,y,z,w)$. We have the following chain of equivalences: \begin{align} u(x,y) \geq u(z,w) & \Leftrightarrow f(u(x,y)) \geq f(u(z,w)) \text{ since } f \text{ is increasing} \\ & \Leftrightarrow g(f(u(x,y)) \geq g(f(u(z,w)) \text{ since } g \text{ is increasing} \\ & \Leftrightarrow h(g(f(u(x,y))) \geq h(g(f(u(z,w))) \text{ since } h \text{ is increasing} \end{align} Thus, the transformation $u \rightarrow h \circ g \circ f \circ u$ preserves the ordering, i.e. it is a positive monotone transformation. Another way to see it is to assume that all functions are differentiable and notice that \begin{equation*} \frac{d (h \circ g \circ f )(x)}{dx}= f'(x) g'(f(x)) h'(g(f(x)) \end{equation*} which is positive since $f'>0,g'>0,h'>0$. 

Your reasoning that $L_1=L_2^{1/3}$ is valid for any $K$. Indeed if this equality does not hold you can lower the cost by reducing the excess input of either skilled or unskilled labor. Thus you can rewrite the cost minimization problem in two dimensions instead of three \begin{equation} \min_{K,L_1}{200 K + 5 L_1 + 6 L_1^3} \end{equation} subject to \begin{equation} K^2 L_1 = q \end{equation} From the constraint you can replace $L_1$ by $q/K^2$ in the objective function, which becomes a minimization problem with one variable $K$ and a parameter $q$. Solving it will give you the cost function as the value function of the problem. 

Your reasoning is not entirely rigorous, Even for a rational agent there can be a small gap between WTA and WTP due to the wealth effect. However, empirically this effect accounts for a very small fraction of the WTA/WTP gap, which is why other explanations are generally preferred. 

It is difficult to provide a list of behavioral economists, because many researchers use behavioral insights in their own field (development, labor, ...). And restricting attention to scholars who focus exclusively on behavioral economics does not help much: it would be akin to trying to provide a list of macroeconomists, or of game theorists, there are simply too many of them. Regarding behavioral environmental economics, I suggest you have a look at the paper "Behavioral environmental economics: promises and challenges" by Rachel Croson and Nicolas Treich, which reviews and discusses this field. 

First, consider the preference relation $\succeq$ defined by \begin{equation*} x \succeq y \text{ if } x_1 + \cdots + x_n \geq y_1+\cdots+y_n \end{equation*} This preference relation satisfies your assumptions. Indeed, suppose that $x \succ y \succ z$. You can check that $y \sim \lambda x + (1-\lambda) z$ for a unique $\lambda$ defined by \begin{equation*} \lambda = \dfrac{y_1+\cdots+y_n-(z_1+\cdots+z_n)}{x_1+\cdots+x_n-(z_1+\cdots+z_n)} \end{equation*} And these preferences obviously admit the utility representation $u(x)=x_1+\cdots+x_n$. Now, consider the lexicographic preference relation $\succeq$ defined (I take $n=2$ for simplicity) by \begin{equation*} x \succ y \text{ if } (x_1>y_1) \text{ or } (x_1=y_1,x_2>y_2) \end{equation*} Lexicographic preferences have two important properties: 

First, let me state that this is a beautiful problem! Here is a proof that $n=4$. To prove that $n \leq 4$, consider the following example: 

The notation is a bit confusing but what the author is computing is the expected utility of the investment, not the utility of the expected outcome. Since the investment results in a wealth of \$120 with probability 0.5 and a wealth of \$90 with probability 0.5, the expected utility equals \begin{align*} \mathbb{E}U & = 0.5 \times (-\dfrac{10^6}{90^3}) + 0.5 \times (-\dfrac{10^6}{120^3}) \\ & \sim -0.98 \end{align*} Notice that this value is lower than the utility of the expected outcome, which is approximately equal to $-0.86$ as you wrote. This is because the agent is risk-averse and must therefore be compensated for the risk. 

A closed set does not need to be bounded. For instance, the set $[0,\infty)$ is closed but unbounded. Formally, a set is closed if it contains all its limit points. You can easily verify that it is the case for your $C$. Take a sequence of elements $x^m=(x_1^m,\cdots,x_n^m) \in C$ that converges to a vector $x^{*}=(x_1^{*},\cdots,x_n^{*})$ under any appropriate topology. The $j$-th coordinate of $x^{*}$, $x_j^{*}$, is the limit of the sequence $x_j^{m}$. Since all $x_j^{m}$ are nonnegative real numbers, so is the case for the limit $x_j^{*}$. Since this is true for all $j$, $x^{*}$ also belongs to $C$. 

Your notation is a bit misleading: it would be better to write $\mathbb{E}u(p)$ or $U(p)$ for the expected-utility associated with $p$ instead of $u(p)$, and $u(\mathbb{E}p)$ for the utility of the expected value of $p$. Formally $u$ is defined on $X$ and not on $\Delta(X)$. Regarding your proof, it seems to me that: $(i)$ you don't explain how to find $s$; $(ii)$ you don't find a certainty equivalent, because $s$ is a lottery. What you want to find is a sure monetary prize, i.e. a degenerate lottery, that the decision-maker values equally as the lottery $p$. For instance, you can notice that, by the monotonicity of $u$, \begin{equation} u(x_{*})\leq \int_{X}{u(x)p(x)dx} \leq u(x^{*}) \end{equation} In addition, the function $u:x \rightarrow u(x)$ is continuous. Therefore, by the intermediate value theorem, there exists $CE_p \in [x_{*},x^{*}]$ such that $u(CE_p) = \int_{X}{u(x)p(x)dx}$. For the uniqueness, imagine that $CE'_p$ is another certainty equivalent of $p$, i.e. that $u(CE'_p)=u(CE_p)$. Since $u$ is strictly increasing (which can be seen as a consequence of the monotonicity with respect to first-order stochastic dominance), we obtain $CE'_p=CE_p$. Notice that you don't need risk aversion to prove the result, but further implies that $CE_p \leq \mathbb{E}p$. 

Are the $\hat{u}_t^2$ independent? If yes, the result is indeed a version of the law of large numbers due to Kolmogorov, and that deals with independent (but not necessarily identically distributed) processes. Here is the formal statement. Suppose that $\{u_t\}_{t=1}^{\infty}$ is a sequence of independent real-valued random variables that satisfies \begin{equation*} \sum_{t=1}^{\infty}{\dfrac{Var(u_t)}{t^2}}<\infty \end{equation*} Then the random variable \begin{equation*} \dfrac{1}{n} \sum_{t=1}^{n}{[u_t-\mathbb{E}(u_t)]} \end{equation*} converges to 0 almost surely. Edit: the assumption of independence seems stronger than needed, and the following result (an adapted version of the law of large numbers for non-independent processes) might be useful. If $\sigma_{n,m}=Cov(u_n,u_m)$ exists, and if there is $0< \alpha <1$ and $M \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $\sigma_{n,m} < M \alpha^{|n-m|}$ for all $(n,m)$, then \begin{equation*} \mathbb{P}(|\dfrac{1}{n}\sum_{t=1}^{n}u_t- \dfrac{1}{n}\sum_{t=1}^{n}\mathbb{E}(u_t)|>\epsilon] < \dfrac{M}{n \epsilon^2} \end{equation*} for any $\epsilon$. 

Thus, the two distributions that she faces are different under these two solutions. If she buys insurance, she completely eliminates the risk of having to pay for the damages. By contrast, if she contracts a loan ex post she still has a large downside risk of $w-D'$ in case of a fire. Under the standard conditions of insurance theory (e.g. risk aversion, actuarially fair insurance prices) it is clear that buying insurance would be strictly preferable. 

You are right, these preferences are separable. A way to see it is to notice that \begin{equation*} U(c,n) \geq U(c',n) \Rightarrow U(c,n') \geq U(c',n') \end{equation*} for any $n,n'$, and \begin{equation*} U(c,n) \geq U(c,n') \Rightarrow U(c',n) \geq U(c',n') \end{equation*} for any $c,c'$. They are even additively separable, as your log-transformation shows. 

Let us fix $m,n \in \mathbb{N}^2$ and suppose that $\dfrac{m}{2^n}x \succeq 0$. Let us show that $\dfrac{m}{2^{n+1}}x \succeq 0$. To this end, we proceed by contradiction and we assume, otherwise, that $\dfrac{m}{2^{n+1}}x \prec 0$. Our lemma yields \begin{equation*} \dfrac{m}{2^{n+1}}x + \dfrac{m}{2^{n+1}}x \prec 0 + \dfrac{m}{2^{n+1}}x \end{equation*} and therefore (computing each side of the inequality) \begin{equation*} \dfrac{m}{2^{n}}x \prec \dfrac{m}{2^{n+1}}x \end{equation*} By assumption $\dfrac{m}{2^{n+1}}x \prec 0$, and we just showed that $\dfrac{m}{2^{n}}x \prec \dfrac{m}{2^{n+1}}x$. By transitivity we obtain $\dfrac{m}{2^{n}}x \prec 0$. This is a contradiction, since the result was supposed to hold for $n$.
