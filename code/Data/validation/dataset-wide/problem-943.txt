SEG-Y files are a general purpose archival format. So they can be "anything". 2D seismic, 3D seismic, raw, processed, unstacked or even derivatives (seismic attributes). How to get information about your data in the SEG-Y file: SEG-Y contain 3 types of headers that describe the data. 

Conoco Philips made the Poseidon data available including 3D seismic data and well logs. $URL$ All data is made available under the terms of the Creative Commons “Attribution 3.0 Australia” licence, be sure to treat it accordingly. 

A seismic measurement, listens really close to the reflection from the subsurface. However, it's a little noisy. "Stacking" is recording the same place over and over, then adding it up to cancel out random noise and enhance coherent signal. However, just doing it in the same area would be very inefficient, therefore we change the acquisition over the point we illuminate, in the picture you see that we have a nice fan of ray geometries going to the same point in the middle, the Common MidPoint CMP. This leads some interesting behaviour. Normal Moveout this is the formulation to calculate how a record from a different angle can be shifted to be in line with another record for the aforementioned stacking. As you can imagine the records that have longer ray paths take longer, depending on the velocity of the rock they travel through. This shift down-ward is namen Normal MoveOut (NMO). The equation above is an approximation, but it's good enough for this explanation, check out the book for more info on this. Post-Stack vs. Pre-Stack A seismic acquisition over a 2D area is named 3D seismic, because X-Y-T (recording time). The data, repeated over the same point in X-Y as mentioned above will have several record with the same T and a different "offset" between the source and the receiver. That means, 3D seismic data coming fresh out of the field will be four-dimensional. This is called pre-stack. Once we do a lot of data preconditioning and filtering and a smarter version of the CMP stacking above, we get 3D seismic that is actually three-dimensional. Stacking versus Migration Stacked data will have all kinds of weird wave effects in it. Usually geologists will work on "migrated" data. A migration aims to find the "true" location of a reflector, reversing wave effects. I suspect you might get this one. Time versus Dpeth You may have wondered from before about X-Y-T. T stands for time not depth, that is because our data is measured in recording time and most geophysicists will work in time. Most likely the migration even is done in time and you get a X-Y-T cube. However, depth-conversion does happen, but it depends on a accurate time-depth relationship. People tend not to trust these too much. Caveat: A depth migration does not have to result in a X-Y-Z cube that you get. Practical Advice As a practical guide, you may want to start at the EBCDIC header. Was your data processed? Stacked? Migrated? Do you have a T-cube or Z-cube? Familiarize yourself with the binary header and a couple trace headers. What are the extents of your data? Etc. Machine Learning Most machine learning is done in proprietary code. The only open source code I know of in seismic deep learning is MalenoV. However, loading a full 3D seismic into RAM will not always be possible. Loading it into the GPU RAM will seldomly be possible. This is the first place, where you are free to come up with a smart solution. Bonus Here is a list of Free Geophysics Software and an awesome list of open geoscience. These aren't exhaustive, but a good start. 

I've found that there may possibly be many meanings of "objectively analyzed" and "objective analysis" in modeling and data assimilation. What are some of the accepted meanings? 

I got in touch with the author of the dataset with my remaining concerns, who responded surprisingly quickly. Here is the essence of everything I learned from people I talked to, including kwinkunks, Simon W, and the author of the dataset, and is intended to augment the existing answers. For both the grid registration and the cell registration, the dataset provides 3 pieces of info: Item #1: lat for each blue dot, Item #2: lon for each blue dot, Item #3: data (elevation/depth) at each blue dot. In addition, for both registrations, each blue dot is at the center of a cell area, and the blue dot represents the average elevation/depth of that cell area. The difference between the two registrations is solely a question of where the outer boundaries (demarcated by the red lines) lie. The cell registered version was created because it was more appropriate for creating maps and images. The grid-registered version presents difficulties for plotting near the poles, which "rolls over" to the other side. As my application is wave modeling and only a subset of the dataset is required, the grid-registered version, being the authoritative and non-flattened version, is the most appropriate for me. I am grateful for everyone who helped. 

You can stop the gif at any time (drag it with your mouse) and all wavefronts will be concentric. You can also see this, when you look at the wave equation. Changes in time equal the velocity times changes in space. If the velocity is constant, a change in time will cause a equal change of wave propagation in any available direction. While often, we work in (x,y,z)-coordinates, here it's easiest to assume that our wave source is at $(0,0,0)$ and if our propagation is equal in all directions, our vector pointing to these points in space is the radius of a perfect sphere. Of course, if we're looking at a half-space like we do in seismics, we have a half-sphere and if we scale back to 2D we have a semi-circle surrounding our source. So if we dig up a huge patch of subsurface and place receivers all around our source, those equally distant from the source should respond at the same time after igniting the source. Ellipsis In Fig. 13 you see the semi-circle. There are several important things to note in this image. The first would be the receiver. The receiver is off-center, but all those receivers in the semi-circle example are too. What makes this different, is that instead of several receivers recording the wave simultaneously, here, it's one singular receiver. Additionally, before our source was nice and centric, now it's off-center. Unfortunately, this is not enough to make sense of Fig. 13. Firstly, for the semi-circle we were looking at direct waves. In Fig. 13 we see reflected waves. Now, they assume constant velocity again, which means there clearly must be a density change to make a reflection happen. This brings us to a simple theoretical question: "I have a measurement with the traveltime $T$. Which locations in the subsurface would have to have a density change to explain my measurement of $T$?" So essentially, you are constructing a plane where the ray path from the source toward the plane, added to the ray path from that incident point on the plane to the receiver is always of the length $T$. Luckily, this is exactly how a half ellipse is formed. You can actually try this with a string. Take a string of the length $T$, fix one end on the source location, one at the receiver location and then put a pen in the sling and trace the outmost location you can reach with the pen in the sling. You have created a surface below your acquisition, which could all have caused a response at your receiver at the time $T$. Fun fact: If you put the source and the receiver back to location $x=0$, your ellipsis becomes a circle again. It's not the semi-circle from before, as before we had a direct wave, now we're looking at a surface of equal reflection traveltime. You can see this in the following figure CC-BY-SA Ag2gaeh: 

The continents formed quite early, between 2.5 and 3 billion years ago. The silicate rock that form most of the granite that makes up both the continents and the continental plates was present at the formation of the Earth. Heat and plate tectonics likely helped form the continents. Life and photosynthesis may have added to them over time, but most of the continental material was present at Earth's formation. Precisely how sea levels change, other than by formation of glaciers or the forming of filling of valleys on land is (to my knowledge) not well understood though the shape of the ocean basin (noted above) plays a key role. The continents are roughly some 35 miles thick in silicate rock, but that far below the Earth's surface, silicate rock can melt and mix with basalt in the upper mantle. We know this because lava can be either basalt rich or silicate rich. Wikipedia mentions sediment and groundwater likely also play roles. Over long enough periods of time, the rock cycle likely returns sediment that erodes of land into the ocean, back to the land. Likewise, life can lead to the formation of limestone and other carbonate rock, but that's probably a small percentage of total land and a small factor, not a major factor. The internal heat of the Earth (I would guess) play a bigger role. A hotter earth, the upper mantle is a little closer to the surface and the granite continents and continental plates are less thick, so they float less high on the basalt, leading to a corresponding higher sea level, but that's just speculation on my part. As Earth cools over hundreds of millions of years, the granite may become thicker and the sea level could drop in relation to the rising land. This fits with the studies that sea level was generally higher in the past, but, again, this is speculation on my part. 

The EBCDIC header is a 40 by 80 character sheet that is a remnant from the times of punchhole cards (I'm not joking). Usually it contains info about the state of the seismic. Processing workflow, acquisition geometries etc. The binary header has some more fixed data about the data set. The trace headers contrain every separate data set from the acquisition. Nice blog by Agile Scientific here. You can read about the details of seismic processing and conventions in the open access book "Seismic Data Analysis". It used to be several hundred dollars and has been cited in every seismic lecture I have ever attended. However, I'll give you some answers now. Common Midpoints CMP stacking, weighted CMP and NMO are highly entangled. 

Hyperbola Figure 14 will again take us a step closer to migration. Before, you looked at One source off-center and one receiver off-center. Now we switch gears again. Let's look at the easiest case here, $x=0$. Here the source and the receiver are at the same location, so the travel time $T_0$ to the imaging point I is equal in length before and after reflection from the subsurface point. But from before we know that this place I could be anywhere on a semi-circle in the subsurface (which would be an ellipse, if it wasn't for the fact the $S=R$, as we saw before). So we need something to convince our math, that instead of placing our image point I "anywhere on a semi-circle", we want the exact location. Here, we have several ways to look at it. If the image point $I$ in the subsurface is actually a point, we call it diffractions. The special property of diffractions is, that they will always reflect your wave right back at you (they diffract the wave, so they scatter the wave in all directions, hence, also back at you). So if you place your source and your receiver at location x=1 in this image, we can construct a triangle between the points $I$, $x=0$ and $x=1$. That means our traveltime T_1 can be calculated with good ol' Pythagoras ($a^2 + b^2 = c^2$): $$1^2 + (T_0/2)^2 = (T_1/2)^2,$$ and we can do this for every point so that: $$T_N = 2 * \sqrt(N^2 + T_0^2/4)$$ and then: $$T_N = T_0 * \sqrt((2N/T_0)^2 + 1)$$ This coincidentally describes the eccentricity of a hyperbola. This is one way to go about finding diffraction hyperbolae, there are several others, but I tried to stick with the provided figures. 

In a cyclone, the pressure gradient force (PGF) and the Coriolis force sustain the spinning motion and causes the direction of spin (counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere). Are there vortices in the atmosphere which are sustained only by the pressure gradient force? 

Let $t_0$ be the time instant of interest, $t_{-1}$ be some time before $t_0$, and $t_1$ be some instant in time after $t_0$. Now there is no confusion with forecast - if the present time is $t_0$, a forecast at $t_1$, for example, uses a model that assimilates observations at $t_0$, and then step forward in time to make the forecast at $t_1$. Suppose now the present time is $t_1$. I'm confused as to what a hindcast at time $t_0$ means. Do we start up the model at $t_1$, then go backward in time to compute the hindcast at $t_0$, or do we start up the model at $t_{-1}$, then run the model forward to get to $t_0$? 

I have heard the term mentioned many times in seminars, and in papers on remote sensing. What does it mean? References would be helpful if available. 

The Maylaysian jetliner that went missing has yet to be found. There are many remote sensing satellites, equipped with radars, currently in service. Together, they provide good coverage of the entire Earth. Why is it their data could not be used effectively in tracking down the path of an airplane? If the airplane lands on the ocean, shouldn't we be able to tell from satellite data? 

Using this chart as a guideline, the next glaciation is more tricky to predict. Perhaps in 60,000 years. These predictions are hard to make though because ice ages are self sustaining. So, short answer, perhaps the best answer. Nobody knows. The Milankovich cycles aren't lining up in the right way to make this prediction easy. We may be set for an unusually long inter-glacial period. As for how catastrophic would it be. Well, for one, we'd see it coming and stopping an ice age would probably be easier than stopping ice from melting. Releasing CO2 and CH4 into the air for example. For a longer answer, how catastrophic would it be is a world-building question. 

The primary drivers are the milankovich cycle, which leads to the ice-age cycle and feedback mechanisms. Colder oceans absorb more CO2, warmer oceans release CO2. CO2 and global temperature have an effect on each other, each driving the other forward or backward depending on how much ice-cover the Earth has. This is a well understood feedback mechanism that in no way contradicts climate change theory, in fact, they go hand in hand. 

This is more Astronomy than Earth Science, but the Young Earth, while forming, would have had a hard time retaining Hydrogen. There's two reasons for this. One is the Frost Line which means there was relatively little hydrogen and relatively little water and other gases present when the Earth formed. And the other is Atmospheric Escape. The Earth doesn't have enough gravity to retain Hydrogen. In fact, the Earth is still losing Hydrogen, by this estimate, about 95,000 tons per year.
