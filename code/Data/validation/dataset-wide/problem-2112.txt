At this point, I accepted. In this entire time, I spoke with the hiring manager twice to make sure that the job duties are what I think they are, and he was available on short notice. I also talked to a finance rep of the company about the RSUs and other aspects of the job offer. This is all to say that it seemed like they were genuinely trying to make everything happen so that I will join. This is a company that is one of the "unicorn" start-ups. I asked for very small increase and was met with a lot of push back until I could produce another offer. Note that: 

How can one better use an offer in hand to negotiate without risking a rescind? I see some obvious negotiation tactics here like asking me to get on the phone, saying that the lower of what I'm asking for is "higher" than they can provide etc. What other negotiation tactics do HR use and how can they be side stepped? 

I suggest you sell yourself (your work) as expensive as you can. But keep in mind that employers have to keep all employees satisfied. In some organizations there are clear rules who gets how much depending on their education (which documents can they provide) the position and the time they are working in that organization. Everybody knows their position in that pecking order and they (have to) accept it. Such an organization is normally not attractive for better than average people. But even in more flexible companies the management has to make sure they keep everybody reasonably happy. Let's say they would give you 50% more salary then others because they think you are very good. And lets say you do a very good job and they would give you even more because they know you are good. Consider what will happen when other people find out that you get so much more than they get. Some will understand that you are better and you earn more. But there will be others who won't like it at all when you get more. Especially if these people think you are not so much better and if they are longer in the company then you. What will the boss do if these people complain? Obviously he can tell them accept it and that's it. But this will be bad for their motivation. So the boss needs to balance what he does. If he is too good to you the others won't like it. If he is not good enough to you then you won't work there. Maybe the boss would be willing to give you more but he can't handle problems with the others. Maybe you can make a deal that you get a "normal" salary and a big bonus which the others don't have to know about. But depending on the company it may be difficult to hide such a deal. Edit: After all the comments I like to add: What I describe here is not the way I think things should be but the way they are. Personally, I negotiated often enough the payment I wanted (mostly freelance work). I work mostly for small companies and I talk directly with the boss and that is confidential between him and me. But in bigger companies other people will know and sometimes this information canâ€™t be kept secret. And then, if the lower paid people find out and get upset, this can be a huge problem for the whole company. Smart bosses avoid getting in this kind of trouble. What the lower paid people do is human nature. I cannot change it. 

A team member and I recently worked on a small part of a pretty big (and high profile) issue. This person looked up relevant details on the prod website and I looked up relevant details on the database. We each only have portion of the access. I came up with most of the theories on what is happening and why. Database is not well developed yet so we don't have full visibility into what is happening. After we were done, I said "Hey when you meet with the dev team, let me know. I'd love to join." and the response was "Yeah sure. I was going to fwd the invite to you anyway". There was a meeting the next day and I was not invited, nor was I CC'ed in any of the emails that were exchanged between the person and the team. I don't expect there to be any follow up meetings regarding this. I have worked in this company for a month. This person has been with the company for many years. They changed the team less than a month back and I imagine that they can contribute to this a little less than I can because background isn't security. The dev team and this person have no previous established relationship. Other than this one task, I have not worked with this person before so I don't know this person's work style. I don't want to come across as paranoid and insecure but I also don't want to be left out of important meetings this early in my time with the company. Should I be concerned that I am intentionally being left out? Or just assume ignorance until proven otherwise because this is the first time? Edit: I have been invited to meetings where future project requirements are being discussed. I take the role of sitting in a corner, being confused and making notes of questions to look up or ask later. This would be the first time I might've made a contribution because I worked on the issue being discussed. 

You are not this person Stretch. If people want to talk with you or about you they should use your real name or a nickname of your choice. People who like or respect you should change their behavior. And the people who just follow what everybody else is doing should also get the message (maybe a little later) 

And then I guess take basically the first job you can get to prove that you can work full time. If you have that job for some time and do good full time work then that is a good position to look for a better job (if you want another job). 

Maybe you should discuss with first with "the team" (who turn and look at you). Ask them how often they look at these screens. Maybe try to agree with them that if this work would be truly shared between the people in the team then it wouldn't be much work for each individual. And if they say they can't see the screens suggest that they should be moved to another place where more people can see them. Maybe you won't be able to share the work with them (initially) but you should be able to involve them in the problem. The point it this is your team's problem and not your problem. And maybe in the next meeting with the boss someone in your team will point out to the boss that you are basically the only person who does that in the moment and this distracts you from your other work. Edit: Independent from above I just had the following idea: Maybe the monitoring system can be improved with audio signals. Silence if all is fine and maybe a beep if there is a small problem and noise if there is a big problem. Then nobody has to watch all the time. If the acoustic signals are good all of you will hear and recognize them. 

The other company is also fantastic and is always mentioned in every employee satisfaction survey. Even that was a major step-up from my current situation. The offer of (x+5),000 is a strong offer. I'm not being low balled. 

I'd also ask you to think about what you're really asking. This is 2x your current salary, so it is very unlikely that your salary will double. You could insert something about how you aren't asking for $70,000, but something closer to 10% - 20% raise of your current salary, depending on how he responds. I wouldn't open with that, simply because you're only asking for average market value. Option-2: I'd also start interviewing elsewhere just to test out the market. If you can go to your manager with data to back up the argument, even better. That conversation can look like this: 

Meanwhile, I was talking to the other two companies to speed up their offers. Both the companies made an offer when I told them that I need to decide. One of the companies offered (x+15),000 above what the original company was offering. Next day (Wednesday): 

If they know already they want to fire you why would they need a meeting for this. A letter would be sufficient. But maybe they think about that maybe they want to fire you and this meeting is about evaluating you before they make a decision. So make sure you are well prepared. 

It sounds like a good question to check your knowledge and attitude at the same time. Let's look at possible answers: 

I suggest you create a sample of what you have in mind maybe on your private notebook (not on a company server and not on an internet server). Then show this sample to the relevant people in your office and show them why this is better than the available options. If your manager/boss likes it then maybe you can to what you want. If for whatever reason they don't want that you do it they will still see that you are actively looking for a good solution for a work related problem. I guess they will see this in a positive light. Be careful that you do this not in your normal work-time and don't use confidential company data on your private notebook. The sample should show your ideas, it does not have to contain real data. 

Over that week, I tried to drag the conversation out as much as I possibly could, talking about other perks, RSUs, etc. to allow other companies to come back with their offers. Few days later, (Monday of next week): 

This does not answer your question of doing damage control, but this answers what you can do during next interview. I think there are two things you should do: 

As Richard mentioned in the previous answer, train with someone you trust. I'd take this one step forward and suggest you train with someone who understands you, and can give suggestions to help you from an outside perspective. If you went to a university, they may have outplacement centers for alum. These people are really good, and will be able to give you some great help. You have the right idea with mentioning it upfront. I'd go a little different route than suggested by Richard. One thought is to address the problem you have like so: 

A lot will depend on which job you want and how much money you want to earn. Maybe a couple of years ago you were happy to take almost any job to get started. And maybe now you want a job doing this and that under those conditions. That is obviously more difficult. Make sure you match your expectations with reality. I.e. if you want a job which requires lots of experience in a certain field make sure you have that experience - otherwise there is not much point to apply for that job. Make also sure to look at more than just your "technical" qualifications. I.e. some people know a lot about technology and they think because they know more than others they should get i.e. the team leader job. But that job requires a lot more than just technical knowledge. Make sure you don't overlook these "other" requirements when you look for a job. 

If I were you, I'd not ask for the raise. I'd just quietly look elsewhere for jobs. But I'm risk averse to a fault. The ideal way to handle this is to decide on a priority list. Do you see yourself working here long term? What do you think about working for a start-up vs a big company? What are the prospects of this start-up? I'll answer the rest of the question with the assumption that you want to continue working here long term. Option-1: Print out the research you've done and bring it to your manager. Decide ahead of time what you are going to ask for, how you propose to earn it. So something like this would be the summary of what you want him to know: 

On Tuesday, he sends an email and insists on doing this over the phone rather than email. My first mistake was answering that call. I read this here: $URL$ 

Yes, sure, I know about this bug xyz which was published on the abc website Yes, sure, I published this bug xyz on the abc website I recently discovered xyz, but probably you know about that already I don't know anything you don't know Yes, I know many things you wouldn't know I know you have a lot of experience, I can't think of anything you wouldn't know. 

If you like contact your old company and offer them your service for x amount of money for y amount of time. Maybe make a deal that you will answer phone calls and/or email for a certain amount of time. It seems they need your knowledge and probably it will be good for their business if you help them out for some time. It's business, you don't have to be shy to ask to get paid for the work you do. Deals like this are not unusual. And normally people who do this kind of consulting work get paid well - more per hour then before when they worked full time.
