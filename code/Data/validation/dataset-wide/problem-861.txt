Magnetic fields are generated by currents - i.e. by the motion of charged particles. As you say, the Sun is full of freely moving charged particles, and these generate currents which in turn generate magnetic fields. No metals required. Most of the magnetic field generation is thought to occur at the interface between the radiative interior of the Sun and an outer convective envelope. This region, called the tachocline, is subject to large shearing motions which are able to take small magnetic fields and amplify them. The stronger magnetic fields are then buoyant, because magnetic fields in a plasma exert a pressure. They therefore emerge at the solar surface in the form of loops of magnetic field. These loops are strongly coupled to the plasma in the Sun. As the plasma moves around turbulently, driven by convective motions and differential rotation on the Sun's surface, the footpoints of the loops are sheared and twisted. There comes a point where the loop will snap back into a configuration with lower magnetic potential energy through a process called reconnection. The reconnection process has a side effect of accelerating particles within the magnetic loops. These relativistic particles smash into the photosphere (actually, they are mainly stopped in the chromosphere which sits above the photosphere), where they release their energy, heating plasma to millions of degrees, which evaporates into the corona. This is a solar flare. 

What determines the Earth's orbital separation from the Sun is the total mass of the Sun and Earth, as described by Kepler's third law. The orbital radius of the Earth is increasing because the Sun is gradually losing mass both by emitting radiation and through the solar wind at a rate of around 5 million tonnes per second (e.g. Noerdlinger 2008). Any gain of mass through the accretion of dust or asteroids (by the Earth or Sun) is negligible by comparison. This mass loss rate is only sufficient to widen the Earth's orbit by about 1.5 cm per year. 

A further issue to consider is that the brown dwarf surface will be far cooler than the Sun and also changes (cools) with time. This means that the radiation received from the planet will push further and further into the infrared as the brown dwarfs gets older and hardly any of the received radiation will be in the visible part of the spectrum. 

The Paschen series absorption requires a population of H atoms in the $n=3$ level and a radiation field containing infrared photons $\leq 1875$ nm, that can boost them in to the $=4,5,6...$ levels. If hydrogen gas is at 25,000K, you can use the Saha equation to work out the fractional ionisation. This depends on both the temperature and density of the gas. For the temperature you have been given, the ratio of ionised to netutral hydrogen is $1.7\times 10^{25}/n_e$, where $n_e$ is the electron number density in m$^{-3}$, The typical particle number densities of an interstellar gas cloud are much, much less (many orders of magnitude) than $10^{25}$ m$^{-3}$, so the gas is totally ionised. If that is the case then there can be no Paschen absorption and no Balmer absorption due to the cloud since there are no atoms in the $n=2,3$ states. There may be small amounts of Paschen and Balmer emission from the cloud via recombination. Thus what you basically see is the spectrum of the star and since you aren't told what kind of star it is, then it's impossible to rule out the presence of emission lines or absorption lines of any kind. It is thus a dreadful and unanswerable question. 

Two questions are asked here. Sean Lake addresses the first - there is nothing unusual about sunlight; it's spectrum contains many dark absorption lines due to various chemical elements. You just need a reasonably high spectral resolution (high dispersion) in order to see them. The light from the Sun comes from the photosphere. We do not see what is going on in the centre with light. Light that is emitted at the centre of the Sun is re-absorbed almost immediately. It is when photons have a reasonable chance of escaping that defines where the visible surface is. In other words, the photosphere marks the point where (moving inwards) the opacity to light increases rapidly. This opacity is not the same at all wavelengths. Where there is a spectral line, due to an electron transition in an atom, it is higher. At these wavelengths, photons can only escape if they are emitted higher in the photosphere, at cooler temperatures. Such light is less intense than at other wavelengths, hence we see an "absorption line". Outside of absorption lines the photospheric opacity must be lower, but non-zero. The main opacity here is caused by bound-free transitions involving the H$^{-}$ ion. Electrons have a continuum of free states they can occupy outside of ions and atoms, so such processes occur over a continuous range of wavelengths. The reverse of these absorption processes (i.e. free-bound emission) is what provides a continuum emission spectrum. The Sun's spectrum is therefore due to material at a variety of temperatures (that is why it isn't a blackbody). Photons in absorption lines (they are not black, just faint) are emitted at maybe 4500K, whilst photons in the continuum come from hotter regions at perhaps a bit more than 6000K. If it were not for the H$^{-}$ ion, the Sun would appear slightly smaller, hotter and with deeper absorption lines. But there would still be other bound-free or free-free processes occurring in the deeper, hotter layers of the Sun that would provide sources of continuous absorption and emission. 

This is such a complex issue that I'm not going to try to be comprehensive. One major thing you are missing is that stars tend not to form in isolation, especially massive stars, but in groups and clusters. The basic unit in star formation is the Jeans mass. $$ M_J \propto T^{3/2} \rho^{-1/2}$$ where $T$ is the temperature, $\rho$ is the density and $M_J$ is the minimum mass for a cloud to gravitationally collapse. So from this point of view, a higher temperature cloud must be more massive in order to collapse in the first place. But as the cloud collapses, the density goes up and the Jeans mass decreases - and the cloud fragments into smaller sub-units and ultimately into a cluster of stars. Exactly how this pans out in practice is basically the whole research field of star formation. It depends not only on relatively simple things like the temperature of the gas, its density, the equation of state; but also on much more complicated ideas like magnetic field support, competitive accretion between stars, feedback from newly-formed stars and protostellar outflows and the rate at which turbulence is generated and then dissipated. There almost certainly is no simple relationship as you propose. In fact the outcome of star formation seems to produce a mass function (number of star per unit mass) that is only weakly dependent on the initial conditions, but may differ a bit in low density and high density environments. 

Your understanding is correct. The doppler shift observed from a galaxy is the sum of its peculiar velocity with respect to the "Hubble flow" and the redshift due to the Hubble flow, which is caused by the expansion of the universe. There is no direct way from a spectrum to separate these two components - they have the same qualitative result. In principle, the expansion of the universe (or a change in the peculiar velocity) could be directly measured by looking for a change in redshift with time, which would depend on the cosmological parameters. This is an extremely small effect and is confused by the peculiar motions of individual galaxies. Nevertheless, measuring this redshift drift is one of the prime goals of the Codex Instrument on the E-ELT (see Pasquini et al. 2010, $URL$ ) using Lyman alpha absorption systems towards distant quasars. This experiment is also planned for the Square Kilometre Array, using the 21cm line (Kloeckner et al. 2015 $URL$ ). In both cases, to overcome the experimental uncertainties (eg at 21 cm, it amounts to line drifts of 0.1 Hz over a decade), then observations of millions of galaxies must be combined. There is no prospect of measuring this effect in an individual galaxy, furthermore I fear your understanding of cosmological redshift is flawed. The dependence on distance is a statistical average, not an absolute dependence. Individual galaxies are moving in individual gravitational potentials from objects around them. This gives them their peculiar velocities with respect to the flow. This velocity could increase or decrease as a galaxy got further away, but is never expected to be large enough to be detectable on human timescales for any individual galaxy. In addition, any change in peculiar velocity should average to zero when looking at millions of galaxies, leaving the redshift drift due to the expansion. 

Referring only to the image you present, the radio part of the image (I think this is a stacked optical and radio image) shows something called the Magellanic stream. Despite what the wikipedia page says, I believe it was discovered by Dieter (1971) using 21 cm observations of neutral hydrogen atoms. The radio emission in the case of the picture you show arises from the so-called "spin flip" transition associated with changes in the relative spin of the proton and electron in a hydrogen atom. A configuration where the spins are anti-parallel has a lower energy than where they are parallel. (Quantum mechanics only allows these two possibilities). The energy difference is small - only $5.87 \times 10^{-6}$ eV. In hydrogen gas in space it is possible for the atom to make a transition from the higher level state to the lower level, in the course of which it emits radiation with a wavelength of 21 cm (i.e. radio waves). This is not seen in terrestrial laboratory samples because the gas is collisionally de-excited before it has the chance to emit radiation. Hence 21cm radiation is an example of a forbidden line, with a long radiative lifetime and which is only observed from the rarefied neutral hydrogen gas found in the interstellar medium. The intrinsic width of the emitted spectral line is very narrow. This means that the observed wavelength of this 21 cm line is an excellent probe of the motion of the emitting gas, since the observed radio waves will be doppler shifted from the 21 cm wavelength at which they were emitted according to the line-of-sight velocity of the gas. The gas in question here has been stripped from the two satellite galaxies of the Milky Way, known as the Magellanic clouds. Although the picture also shows copious 21 cm radiation arising from neutral hydrogen gas in the plane of our Milky Way. There are many other ways that gas can be a source of radio emission. In addition to atomic and molecular transitions that give radio emission at discrete wavelengths (including the radio equivalent of lasers, called masers), there can be continuum emission caused by the acceleration of electrons in the electric fields of partially and completely ionised ions - so called bremsstrahlung or free-free emission. There is also recombination radiation (free-bound) radiation and continuum radiation emitted by electrons that are accelerated in electromagnetic fields - cyclotron radiation; synchrotron radiation (if the electrons are relativistic); curvature radiation (a variety of synchrotron radiation) or even just the Rayleigh-Jeans tail from cold blackbody emission (e.g. in the cosmic microwave background). A decent introductory summary can be found here. 

Gyrochronology uses the rotation periods of stars, caused by rotational modulation by starspots to estimate a stellar age. In the absence of differential rotation, the rotation axis inclination has no effect on this measurement. The doppler broadening of spectral lines plays no role in gyrochronology. The rotation period of a star is just that. It is the period that is measured from the light curve. So it is some sort of emission-weighted average rotation period that depends on the distribution of starspot latitudes, the stellar inclination and the limb darkening. Sometimes there is evidence of differential rotation because the rotation period of the star changes from epoch to epoch. This can be used to calibrate the uncertainty in an individual rotation period measurement. Differential rotation is a source of uncertainty in gyrochronology, however its effect is limited because (i) at least on the Sun, and maybe other stars too, spots are confined to relatively low latitudes; (ii) spots occur at a range of latitudes over this latitude range. It is likely that younger, faster rotating stars do have spots at higher latitudes, but these stars also appear to have much weaker differential rotation than the Sun ($\Delta P/P =0.05 P^{0.3}$ according to Donahue et al. 1996, where $\Delta P$ characterises the range of measured periods for a typical star of period $P$). The effect of differential rotation on gyrochronology is discussed at length by Epstein & Pinsonneault (2014) and rather more concisely by Jeffries (2014). It appears that differential rotation probably does set the precision limit of a measured period to be around 10 per cent (though I would argue that it is smaller for younger stars). Because the rotation rate of a star roughly follows the Skumanich-type spin-down law $\Omega \propto t^{-1/2}$, then this leads to an age uncertainty of around 20% in older stars. For younger stars it is the initial spreads in rotation rates which are more important than differential rotation as a source of error. 

To a first approximation when we calculate how fast an object is orbiting around some mass distribution we can assume that the gravitational attraction it experiences is only that due to the mass interior to its orbit. This approximation, known as the shell theorem should only be applied when the mass distribution is spherically symmetric, or most of the mass is concentrated well inside the orbit of the object. The bulge of our Galaxy can be considered roughly spherically symmetric, and it appears that the mass distribution is strongly concentrated towards the centre. Hence we can say that the centripetal force on an orbiting object is provided by the gravitational force due to the mass interior to its (again, I am assuming a circular orbit for the sake of argument, but this doesn't greatly matter) orbit is $$ m\frac{v^{2}}{r} = Gm \frac{M(r)}{r^2},$$ where $m$ is the mass of the object (which cancels out) and $M(r)$ is the mass inside radius $r$. Thus the orbital speed $v$ is given by $\sqrt{GM(r)/r}$. Thus by observing orbital speeds we can calculate roughly what mass exists interior to the orbit. In the case of stars near the centre of our Galaxy, that turns out to be 4 million solar masses, packed into a space that is extremely small. The reason it is thought to be a black hole is not because of the mass, but because it is mass that is (i) densely packed and (ii) cannot be seen. Even if it were a bunch of massive stars shrouded in dust, so that you could not see it in visible light, you can easily calculate that the heated dust should be kicking off huge amounts of infrared radiation; and that is not seen. In the case of the Sun, well, the mass interior to the Earth's orbit is much larger than 4 million solar masses, it is many billions of solar masses. The contribution of the black hole at the centre is completely swamped by all the other mass in our Galaxy, so we are not directly influenced by the central black hole. If you removed the central black hole, the stars that were near it would be orbiting way to fast for the new $M(r)$ that they experience. They would fly off and assume highly elliptical orbits with much larger semi-major axes, though I think they would still be part of the Galactic bulge. Stars further out, including our Sun would have their orbits changed imperceptibly, because $M(r)$ will hardly have changed for them. 

The galaxy that is receding away from us fastest is whichever galaxy currently holds the record for the highest measured redshift. This galaxy obviously changes as more and more discoveries are made. This web page that describes redshift, may keep an up-to-date record of this. It lists UDFy-38135539, discovered in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field, as a previous record holder (see below), with a spectroscopically confirmed redshift of $z=8.5549 \pm 0.0002$. That is, lines in the spectrum appear at wavelengths that are a factor of $(1+z)=9.55$ times longer (redder). But there is apparent controversy over the claimed detection of spectral features in this galaxy. (e.g. Bunker et al. 2013). Bramnmer et al. (2013) report the "tentative detection" of a possible Lyman alpha emission line at $z=12.12$ for UDFj-39546284, another ultra deep field galaxy. Either way it seems only a matter of time before $z>9$ galaxies are confirmed, since there are many candidates that have so far been selected only by virtue of their peculiar colours (Lyman break galaxies at near infrared wavelengths, including MACS0647-JD mentioned in comments to other posts). e.g. Bouwens et al. (2014). Update Oesch et al. (2016) report HST grism spectroscopy of a high redshift galaxy candidate, GN-z11, identified in the CANDELS/GOODS survey. They confirm the presence of a Lyman break indicating a spectroscopic redshift of 11.1. This appears to be the current record holder. The reasons that these galaxies are receding from us is simply the expansion of the universe. Galaxies that are further away appear to recede faster. The galaxies discussed above must be $>13$ billion light years away according to the current "concordance" cosmological model. Translating a redshift to a recession velocity requires knowledge of the cosmological parameters. Fig.2 of Davis & Lineweaver (2004) shows the relationship. For our current best estimates of cosmological parameters, a redshift of 11 corresponds to a recession velocity of 2.3c. That is, this galaxy is currently receding from us at 2.3 times the speed of light.
