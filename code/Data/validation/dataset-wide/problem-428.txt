Sound waves are propagated through a medium, wherever there is a medium, there will be sound. However if you can create some kind of phenomena on the planet that generates a sound noise level high enough so any practical communication would be impossible, it would work. If the planet produces white noise at around 100dB or produces a single sound frequency at the max atmospheric pressure, that would hinder the use of sound to communicate. The explanation for the latter proposal is that in order for the waves to be called sound, they need to oscillate, just like an AC wave. If there is already a one frequency that touches the minimum pressure, any other higher frequency would need to go to a negative pressure in order to manifest as sound, which is impossible. Imagine creating a wave that touches the top of an aquarium, and the lower part touches the bottom part of the aquarium, if you wanted to add a smaller wave within that big wave, you would need the water to go above and below the aquarium walls. In fact, water can go higher and over the open aquarium, just like pressure, but a vacuum is the lowest pressure you can obtain. However, I am not sure what that would do to humans, since we know that prolonged exposure to loud sounds is very unhealthy, and I am pretty sure sound at the maximum atmospheric pressure would be similar to periodically generating shockwaves, which would kill any living organism caught in it. 

They cannot change their sex. Their shape-shifted age is always proportional to their actual age (adult to adult animal). They have no other abilities: they don't have telepathy, can't talk as an animal, and are not immune to bullets. 

What would be some interesting/ideal jobs for a character that can turn into any animal? (Edit: This is a world in which the character is the one that actually reveals the supernatural to the world, unintentionally. Setting is "10 minutes in the future", for all the character knows they are the only one of their kind.) The only limitations to the character's shape-shifting being that: 

A patient in the ER, who was admitted for poisoning, turned into an animal (and back again) right in front of people (and presumably on CCTV). How might doctors proceed with this complication? 

The main benefit of a humanoid appearance is bipedalism (walking on two legs). This means that the species while bipedal can: engage in log distance jogging (arguably the first method of hunting in which the prey is worn down over time), and elevated head (in which more can be seen further) and the arms freed for tool use and social expression. Lastly, speech is always a added benefit of a humanoid form, but assuming that the various species has had always had the ability to change between the two, I assume some form of communication that can be used in either form has been created. The benefits of the animal form would be increased mobility (primarily speed and climbing), greater resistance to environmental conditions (weather, cold, heat etc), and increased senses; particularly senses of smell and hearing. Additionally, if there are also normal human beings in your setting, being able to assume a completely-animal form would allow your species's to disguise their true nature. 

This is a bit of a stretch, but it is hard to define "medieval technology". A lot of principles we know today were known in the medieval era, but no one practiced them, either caused by a lack of interest (i.e. A merchant would be able to earn money and not starve, but physicist that creates useless rolling ball would starve) or a lack of resources (literacy rates were very very low). If people had the time and energy, really the cities wouldn't be that different from now, since humans created very large and complex architecture since a long time BC (i.e. pyramids, stonehenge, cathedrals, Colosseum, etc). One of the factors preventing or rather inhibiting the medieval times from building skyscrapers were the lack of population. Why build higher when you can easily build further? So basically, anything is possible, except structures based on modern technology (plastics, aluminium, reinforced steel, tempered glass, carbon composites, etc) 

My first thought would be that everyone else went away. Perhaps we live in a relatively bad area of the universe and all the life forms that could do so left. Think about what humans are doing. We want to get to Mars, because that's the next "great leap for mankind," but after that, are we really going to stay in our little corner of the galaxy, poking around on every little planet out there as our home world deteriorates? Absolutely not! We'll be on the first ship out, once we have a ship to take us. Our technological boom is powered by the destruction of our planet, to the point that we might never be able to save it, so once a viable escape option becomes a realistic and nearly certain option, the odds are good that we'll damn what's left of the planet to finish our ship and then be off to the best planet we can reach. That probably won't be the nearest one, or the occupied one. It will be far away and it will have the kinds of elements we deem desirable in a home-world. It seems to me that most intelligent (the use of 'intelligent' to describe species that wreck their planets may be a stretch, but you know what I mean) species would probably do the same thing we humans are doing, and as you said, technology advances so quickly that once the first breakthrough in this technology is made, the rapid expedition of life from a planet is not far behind. This creates a natural separation of those-with-awesome-tech from those-without-awesome-tech, and if we assume that our planet (or whatever planet you may be writing from) is in a district of space that no one wants to live in once they know there's an alternative, it's quite reasonable to assume that the only life-forms we would have contact with in our pre-overpowering-technology stage would be other species in pre-overpowering-technology stage. It's not because that's the only age of life there is, it's just that that's the only age of life that hasn't left yet. Along this same vein, you could work in that some life-forms built up to near-overpowering-tech levels, then crashed their societies, either through destruction of resources or overpopulation or what-have-you, and now are either primitive once more, barren wasteland planets, or maybe some kind of steam-punk blend of futuristic lost technology in a less-advanced society. You could also make some kind of historical event that allowed for the evolution of life at a specific time. Like, maybe there was some kind of massive super-nova/black-hole/worm-hole/antimatter something-or-other that created a wave of magnetism or some such that allowed for the evolution of life from the elements. This wave would travel out, and as it passed over a certain area in space, it would spark life on every 1 in 100 star systems. Because life started at about the same time in the same neighborhoods of space, the life on those planets would be about the same age. As you went farther from your home-world, you'd find life that increasingly differed in age from your own species. 

The really big implication of this would be losing randomness in such universe. Everything would be perfectly predicable, down to the subatomic level. (Assuming by Newtonian universe you also mean quantum mechanics do not exist.) There would be no transistors and all computers would be based on some other sort of method to compute numbers (whether digital or analogue). If people in such universe would be able to build a supercomputer that can approximate the universe, they would find out that they lack free will and consciousness, since everything will be predictable and everything in the past would be known, just by running a simulation. See $URL$ and $URL$ both principles are fundamental to how our universe work. Basically it is very hard to say if everything would change, as you removed a huge chunk of the physics in our universe. We can only hypothesize, and we can't even know if such universe would exist or stay stable. 

Here's the pitch: A character gets outed as a supernatural creature. This person grew up around normal humans, grew up into adulthood (without anyone finding out what they are), and even has normal human siblings and parents. They only found out their otherness around puberty (what can I say, I love that trope). They have a human lifespan, and whatever can kill a human will most likely kill them as well.The character had a few interviews, assured the public that they meant no harm, and participated in some minimally invasive experiments. It has been days, then weeks, then months, and eventually a year, yet no-other supernatural creature has made its presence known. My question is: How would this effect someone mentally if they were that supernatural creature? 

What would happen if the following happened in a hospital. (Assume that this is the real world, where magic shouldn't exist.) 

Seems quite reasonable. I would recommend a few changes/additions, both in keeping with tradition and to improve the model. Firstly, on coat color. I agree that the human hair and the horse hair should match, but skin tone really doesn't need to. My cat has black hair and white skin, so if she were bald from the ribs up, she'd be mismatched too, but its perfectly normal. Most animals don't have stripes or spots on their skin, despite have striped or spotted coats, so a centaur might have brown hair and white skin, or even white hair and black skin, although it would probably be more visually pleasing to keep the two colors similar. Additionally, I would think that the human's hair would extend farther down his spine, like the mane of a horse. Maybe not all the way to the second shoulders, but at least down past the first shoulders. Secondly on internal organs- Digestion: As mentioned in some of the comments, a centaur really can't survive on human-sized organs, so I recommend horse guts in the horse part. Big lungs, big heart, big stomach, but only one stomach. If a centaur is really a mix of human and horse, it should have a human-esque stomach, capable of processing meat. Classical centaurs are archers, presumably not shooting at grass and berries, so give them big, horse-sized human stomachs. This also solves the problem of low-nutrition grass. If centaurs were only eating berries and leaves, they would be too busy grazing to get anything done, like teaching Achilles and Jason to fight. Side note, if Chiron had spent a little less time foraging and a little more time teaching, Achilles might have known to wear boots into battle instead of sandals. Heart: Definitely a big horse heart in the horse chest, but I think a smaller, back-up heart should be in the human chest. Most mythological creatures are pretty hard to kill, so it makes sense that if you spear the centaur's horse-heart, a secondary, emergency heart could take over. Of course, this heart couldn't keep the centaur up and active, but it might be enough to keep him alive for a while in a comma-like state. It would eventually give out, but if he got a horse-heart transplant or something, he might pull through. With that in mind, a second, smaller set of lungs should be in the human half as well. If nothing else, it would increase the oxygen uptake and blood flow of the centaur. Brains: Of course, centaurs are assumed to have human intelligence, suggesting a human brain, but brains do a lot more than just support consciousness. People say humans only use 10% of our brains, which only accounts for conscious use. 100% of the brain is used, just not for thinking. A lot of it is devoted to little things like telling the heart to beat, the stomach to churn, and the lungs to fill. Not to mention processing nerve signals, handling balance, and regulating temperature. A mouse and a rabbit have similar conscious brains, but a rabbit still needs more gray matter because the rabbit has more body to manage. A horse is less intellectual than a man, but the horse still needs a bigger noggin because the horse is much bigger, so I advise a secondary brain at the juncture of human and horse. The lower brain should handle basic functions, the higher brain should handle consciousness and personality. Another way to do this might be to extend the brain down the spine, eliminating the troublesome second brain. Some animals already have brain extending down their brain stems (that's why, if you do it right, you can cut the head off a chicken and he'll still run around) so it's not an impossible idea.
