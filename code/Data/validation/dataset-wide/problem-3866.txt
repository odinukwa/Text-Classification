I'm fine with 1. I'm not sure about 2 - where is the argument taking place, in $V$ or in $M$, or both? For 3, it appears the underlying argument is this: $V \vDash \forall E \subset C\ (E$ directed and $|E| < \kappa \Rightarrow \bigcup E \in C)$ and so $M \vDash \forall E \subset j(C)\ (E$ directed and $|E| < j(\kappa) \Rightarrow \bigcup \in j(C))$ I can accept this assuming that 2 means "$D \in M$ and $M \vDash |D| < j(\kappa )$." I'm having trouble with 4 as well - I believe that $j[\lambda] \subseteq \bigcup D$, but why does the reverse inclusion hold, i.e. why is it that $x \in C, \beta \in j(x) \Rightarrow \beta \in j[\lambda]$? 

If you can prove $\phi$, then you can prove $\psi \rightarrow \phi$. Also, you can always prove $\phi \rightarrow (\psi \rightarrow \phi)$. Thus there's no difference between the two situations you mentioned since they're always possible (no matter what $\phi$ and $\psi$ are). Looking at your comments to Joel's answer, what you meant to ask was the relationship between items 2 and 3 in the list below: 

For the reverse implication, suppose "weak weak $(\omega ,\omega )$-distributivity" holds, and for contradiction let $u \neq 0$ be the Boolean value of the sentence "there exists a dominating real," and let $\dot{g}$ be a name witnessing this, i.e. the sentence "$\dot{g}$ is a dominating real" has Boolean value $u$. Define $u _{m,k} = || \dot{g} (m) = k ||$. Now if $G$ is any $\mathbb{B}$-generic filter containing $u$, noting that the left side of the distributivity identity is (at least) $u$, we know that the right side belongs to $G$. It's then not hard to see that: 

For concreteness, let $A = \{\aleph_n : n < \omega\}$. We know $\max \mathrm{pcf}(A) \in [\aleph_{\omega+1},\Pi A]$. My question is, if $\Pi A$ is big (say, $\aleph_{\omega_1+1}$), then which cardinals in that interval can $\max \mathrm{pcf}(A)$ really be? My second question, which motivates the first, is: Let $E = \{\aleph_{2n} : n < \omega\}$ and $O = \{\aleph_{2n+1} : n < \omega \}$; then is it possible for $\max \mathrm{pcf}(A) = \max \mathrm{pcf}(E) \gg \max \mathrm{pcf}(O)$ (where $\gg$ means "much larger than" in any way you care to make precise)? If the answer to the first question is that $\max \mathrm{pcf}(A)$ can never really be that big, then the second question doesn't matter. But if it can be big, and the answer to the second question is that the even alephs and the odd alephs can have very different $\max\mathrm{pcf}$'s, I would find that somewhat disturbing. 

Main Question: Does anyone know of a reference that can tell me which axioms of ZFC Quine's New Foundations prove, disprove, and leave undecided? Secondary Question: I've read that diagonal arguments don't go through in NF and thus can't be used to prove that the reals are uncountable. Does NF manage to prove the uncountability of the reals by some other means or does that fact (normally rendered as "$P _1(\mathbb{N}) < P(\mathbb{N})$" in order to make sense in NF) turn out to be undecidable in NF? 

Note that since $\kappa$ is measurable, $\aleph _{\kappa} = \kappa$. Okay, now we know that a normal measure extends the club filter, and the set of cardinals below $\kappa$ is club in $\kappa$, hence it makes sense in the hint to define $f(\aleph _{\alpha}) = \aleph _{\alpha + \beta}$ without specifying how $f$ acts on non-cardinals. Following my comment, let $g(\aleph _{\alpha}) = 2^{\aleph _{\alpha}}$. Then $g \leq f$ almost everywhere, and so: 

This probably isn't the kind of thing anyone just knows off hand, so anyone who's going to answer the question is just going to look at a list of large cardinal axioms and their definitions, and try to see which ones are satisfied by $\aleph _0$ and which aren't. You could've probably done this just as well as I could have, but I decided I'd do it just for the heck of it. First of all, this doesn't cover all large cardinal axioms. Second, many large cardinal axioms have different formulations which end up being equivalent for uncountable cardinals, or perhaps inaccessible cardinals, but may end up inequivalent in the context of $\aleph _0$. So even for the large cardinals that I'll look at, I might not look at all possible formulations. 

(Rooted serial directed graph) $\bar{V}(\bar{s}) \wedge \forall x \bar{V}(x) \rightarrow [\neg \bar{E}(x,x) \wedge \exists y (\bar{V}(y) \wedge \bar{E}(x,y))]$ (Schema for what goes in $N$) As $\phi(x_1, \dots ,x_n)$ varies over $\mathcal{R}^+$: $\forall \vec{x} \exists Y \forall x \left (\phi(\vec{x}) \rightarrow \left[ \bar{N}(Y) \wedge \bigwedge _i (x_i \bar{\epsilon} Y) \wedge \left (x \bar{\epsilon} Y \rightarrow \bigvee _i (x = x_i)\right )\right ]\right )$ (Schema for what stays out of $N$) As $\phi(x_1, \dots ,x_n)$ varies over $\mathcal{R}^-$: $\forall \vec{x} \forall Y \exists x \left (\phi(\vec{x}) \rightarrow \neg \left[ \bar{N}(Y) \wedge \bigwedge _i (x_i \bar{\epsilon} Y) \wedge \left (x \bar{\epsilon} Y \rightarrow \bigvee _i (x = x_i)\right )\right ]\right )$ 

Furthermore, I've shown that given $X \subset \mathcal{P}(\kappa)$ which is a DLO under inclusion (and $\cup X = \kappa$, and $|X| > \kappa$), it can be modified to give $X' \subset \mathcal{P}(\kappa)$ which is also a DLO under inclusion, has the same size as $X$, and has a dense subset of size $\kappa$: First, obtain $X_0$ from $X$ by removing, for each $\alpha < \kappa$, the greatest lower bound in X (if it exists) of the collection $\{x \in X : \alpha \in x\}$; Next obtain $X'$ from $X_0$ by adding, for each $\alpha < \kappa$, the set $x _{\alpha} = \cup \{x \in X_0 : \alpha \notin x\}$. So an equivalent reformulation of the question is: Is it consistent that for some $\kappa$, there is no $X \subset \mathcal{P}(\kappa)$ of size $2^{\kappa}$ which forms a DLO under inclusion? 

weakly inaccessible - yes, obviously inaccessible - yes, obviously Mahlo - no, since the only finite "inaccessibles" are 0, 1, and 2 as noted by Michael Hardy in the comments, and the only stationary subsets of $\omega$ are the cofinite ones weakly compact: 

The answer to this is no, for example the Cohen forcing that adds more than continuum-many reals is ccc but has size greater than continuum. So what about: 

Therefore, if we replace $\kappa = \omega$ with $\kappa = \omega_1$ in Pouzet's theorem, we can't apply the same proof. However I've been told (by Todorcevic) that the following is in fact true: 

A conjecture of Galvin's is that the following is possible (which I take to mean that the consistency of the following can be proven relative to the consistency of something like ZFC, or ZFC plus some large cardinal): 

(I overhauled my original answer to better tailor it to your question). First off, although the general satisfaction relation (for both classes and sets) is not formalizable in ZFC, the satisfaction relation for set models is formalizable. That is, there is an $\mathcal{L}$-formula $\mathrm{Sat}$ such that $\mathrm{Sat}(M,E,\ulcorner \varphi \urcorner,x_1,\dots ,x_n) \leftrightarrow (M,E)\vDash \varphi (x_1, \dots , x_n)$. Just as you could unpack the definition of what it means for a real function to be continuous at a point and express it in ZFC, you can unpack the definition of what it means for a set model to satisfy a formula. That said, this would typically be quite tedious to write down, and so in particular you probably wouldn't want to prove the $L_{\alpha+1}$ exist by applying Separation to the power set of $L_{\alpha}$, although you could. Rather, the typical approach is to find an alternative yet provably equivalent way of characterizing $\mathrm{Def}(L_{\alpha}) = L_{\alpha+1}$ in terms of something other than definable subsets, and then prove that the thing satisfying this other characterization exists. The approach you'll see in Jech uses the notion of Godel operations, cf. Corollary 13.8 and the preceding lemmas and theorems. Kunen also presents an alternative approach which also has to do with closing off under certain operations, and I feel his approach is better motivated, so I recommend checking out Chapter VI, Section 1 in Kunen's "Set Theory: An Introduction to Independence Proofs." Let me add parenthetically that yes, you can deal with the $\exists a_1, \dots a_n \in L_{\alpha}$ so that you do get a formula of ZFC. One way is to say 

$D$ is a directed subset of $j(C)$. $D$ has size $|C| \leq \lambda ^{< \kappa} < j(\kappa )$. Therefore $\bigcup D \in j(C)$. $\bigcup D = j[\lambda ]$ 

When it comes to set theory specifically, if you get a response like, "so you're trying to describe ultimate reality," you have to spend a bunch of time convincing them that current set theory isn't really about anything that they already know or familiar with. If you manage to do this, then you'll be faced with the following question, "then what's the point?" This is where some historical motivation becomes necessary I think. So you could explain that Cantor started the study of sets almost 150 years ago because people were starting to study the real numbers, and functions on them, in more and more sophisticated ways and talking about infinity in more and more sophisticated ways, and so this "required" a more sophisticated, rigorous framework for talking about these things. This naturally led to asking more precise questions about infinity. Thinking about the real line as set of points and not just a geometric line, and thinking about functions as objects that act on points, was quite a novel idea at the time. You can try to explain the importance of bijections to the notion of size and counting, and then state and vaguely explain that $\mathbb{N}$, $\mathbb{Z}$, and $\mathbb{Q}$ have the same size, but $\mathbb{R}$ is strictly bigger. Emphasize that $\mathbb{Q}$ only seems bigger than $\mathbb{N}$ because the way it's arranged not because it actually has more things. Then introduce Cantor's Problem - is there a subset of the reals that's a bigger infinity than the naturals but a smaller infinity than the whole set of reals? Then I'd talk about Hilbert and his famous problems, the first two of his problems being about putting math on a rigorous logical foundation. Talk about how truth and provability can be formalized, what it would mean for a formula to be true (in some model) but unprovable (from some axioms), and then talk about Godel's groundbreaking results on incompleteness. I would then come back to set theory, mentioning that a great variety of questions had come up in set theory, a good deal of them had turned out to be undecidable, including Cantor's Problem. 

(Not an answer, but too long for a comment) One way to look at what you're asking for is a theory in some appropriate language which axiomatizes that we have a serial directed rooted graph, and a collection of subsets of the graph which behaves like $N(\mathcal{G},s)$, where the part of the axiomatization that dictates the behaviour of $N(\mathcal{G},s)$ doesn't say anything about the graph relation on $\mathcal{G}$. I'll give an axiomatization where the part that talks about $N(\mathcal{G},s)$ does mention the graph relation, and I'll set it up in such a way that it'll seem unlikely that it can be redone without mentioning the graph relation. I'm not sure about this, it's just an idea, but it's too long for a comment. The Language Consider the language $(\bar{V}, \bar{N}, \bar{E}, \bar{s}, \bar{\epsilon})$ - two unary relation symbols, one binary relation symbol, one constant symbol, and another binary relation symbol, respectively. I'm going to set up a theory whose finite models will be precisely (sort of) those in which $(\bar{V}, \bar{E})$ is interpreted as a directed serial graph $\mathcal{G}$, $\bar{s}$ gets interpreted as a member $s$ of $\bar{V}$, $\bar{N}$ gets interpreted as $N(\mathcal{G},s)$, and $\bar{\epsilon}$ gets interpreted as the membership relation, a subset of $\bar{V} \times \bar{N}$. Setting up the right theory is easy, the only part that will require a little explanation is how we ensure $\bar{N}$ gets interpreted correctly. Axiomatizing $N(\mathcal{G},s)$ when we're allowed to mention the edge relation Consider a formula like: $$x_1 = \bar{s} \wedge x_1 \neq x_2 \wedge x_1 \neq x_3 \wedge x_2 \neq x_3$$ $$\wedge \bar{E}(x_1,x_2) \wedge \bar{E}(x_2,x_1) \wedge \neg \bar{E}(x_1,x_3) \wedge \neg \bar{E}(x_3,x_1) \wedge \neg \bar{E}(x_2,x_3) \wedge \neg \bar{E}(x_3,x_2)$$ It "says" we have three distinct $x_i$, the first one is $s$, and it tells you exactly which pairs stand in edge relation to one another and which don't. You can also tell by looking at it that it defines a set $\{ x_1, x_2, x_3\}$ which contains an infinite path starting at $s$, namely $x_1, x_2, x_1, x_2, \dots$. Let's define $\mathcal{R}$ to be the set of formulas in the language $(\bar{s}, \bar{E})$ of the form $\phi(x_1, \dots , x_n)$ which say that the $x_i$ are distinct, and which tell you precisely which pairs of the $x_i$ stand in $\bar{E}$ relation to one another, and which don't. Define $\mathcal{R}^+$ to be those formulas $\phi \in \mathcal{R}$ such that for any rooted directed graph $((V,E),s)$, we have that: $(V,s,E)\vDash \phi(v_1, \dots , v_n) \rightarrow \{v_1, \dots , v_n\} \in N((V,E),s)$. $\mathcal{R}^-$ will be those $\phi$ such that: $(V,s,E)\vDash \phi(v_1, \dots , v_n) \rightarrow \{v_1, \dots , v_n\} \not\in N((V,E),s)$. Alright, now here's our theory:
