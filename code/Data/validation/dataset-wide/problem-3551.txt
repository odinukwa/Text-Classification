The basic equation for losing fat is to burn more calories per day than you take in. The anecdote that they give trainers is that to lose 1 pound of pure fat per week, you need to burn 500 more calories than you take in per day. So if you are eating an otherwise normal 2000 calorie diet, you need to burn 2500 calories per day. So, the #1 thing to do is to get your diet in order. It sounds like you are already well on the way to doing that. The top priority for any diet that has sustainable weight loss as a goal is to get rid of as much artificial and processed food as you can. This includes soda and other such things. Basically, if you look at a food and can't identify which plant or animal it came from, you probably shouldn't be eating it. Beyond that, you are going to want to make sure you have a good intake of fruits and vegetables on a daily basis. The USDA says 5 a day...and really, that's about the bare minimum. You would be much better served by eating 10 servings of fresh fruits and vegetables per day. These dietary notes are all very broad and general. If you're serious about getting rid of this weight for good, I would encourage you to find a personal trainer at a local gym and figure out some specifics based on your unique situation. I think this is particularly true for you for two main reasons. 

This procedure relaxes away any minor aches and pains that could theoretically linger, then feeds my body with exactly what it needs to repair and react to the pressures I've put on it. It also feels great to be worn out, relaxed, and fed. 

Spend 15 minutes outside every sunny day. Read a book and enjoy the sunlight. You don't have to start with any particular exercises. Just stroll through the park, around the block, sit on a bench or your lawn and read. This will start to break your sedentary pattern and provide some (probably much-needed) vitamin D to start activating your body. You will also start to associate this time with leisure and fun - which is what your exercise should be in the first place. Do it on your break from work if you want. Turn those 15 minutes into a brisk walk. Don't push yourself or try to break a sweat. Just walk a little faster than you normally would and breathe deep. This will start to establish the exercise routine. As you get more comfortable, extend that 15 minutes into 30-45, whatever's comfortable. This provides the basis for the exercise period you'll work into. You may have to move your time slot to make it fit. Start exploring (more questions here would be great) on what sorts of exercises are out there, and what sort of exercises interest you. Exercise for the sake of exercise is not sustainable for most people. Most people need to exercise for the sake of fun. Ask around for input until you hear something that makes you say, 'hey, that sounds fun!' Then work that into your normal workout. You will want to start with cardio exercises since those tend to be easiest and provide the biggest mental boost. Start learning how to work toward weight and strength goals. Again, more questions here would be great, as would be help from fitness professionals. Learn a structure for stabilizing, isolating, and strengthening muscles so you can fulfill needs when you see them. This will really empower your routine and make you feel like you're absolutely in control of your body. 

I have never heard this called the 'Hay diet', but I am familiar with the concepts involved here. From my learning, it's simply called 'food matching', and simply talk about which foods should be eaten with which. The basics, as I've learned them, go like this and are pretty simple: 

As far as who to trust, honestly any answer someone gives to that question is going to instantly be met with harsh criticism if the environment is right. If you say the government, people can (rightly) point to the often dubious links between the FDA and the companies it regulates. If you say someone like the Weston A Price foundation (a leading advocate for nutrition therapy), people will (rightly) point out that W.A.P is an advocacy group and is biased by its basic charter. And I scarcely need to mention the problems with trusting corporations or their spin-offs. The only place I have found that almost all reasonable people agree is reliable is the Cochrane Collaboration. They are an international, non-profit group that has a charter dedicated to providing the best in evidence-based medical research. They are a public charity formed under the laws of the United Kingdom, their funding is open for everyone to see, and it passes muster in the opinions of almost everyone I've met. As far as who to trust in your life, I would strongly recommend you build a working relationship with people who deal in nutrition and fitness every day - personal trainers, nutritionists, etc. I personally went to 6 different gyms and rather blatantly interviewed the trainers and nutritionists to probe their current and continued learning before settling on a gym I like. None of the people I 'interviewed' ever got angry at me, because I was paying club dues at the time - it's your right as a member/customer to know who you are working with! The payoff to this is that as the years go on, your body changes, and our knowledge of the human body changes, you will have resources you know you can rely on to tell you the truth in their professional opinions. 

Creatine is like any other supplement; taking a megadose at once will give you progressively worse absorption, so mixing it with other things is useful to help you get more. It doesn't have to be juice. It can be milk or any other liquid you enjoy. I've known some people who put it in their tea. I personally think the texture of that is pretty vile, but whatever, works for them. As for when to take it, before and after is the generally accepted wisdom, because those are the times your body will be making good use of the nutrition you're providing it. Taking it when you don't need it just makes it more likely that it will get passed with your urine. Someone else will have to handle the cycling question; I have only my own experience to draw upon there and I consider that way too little to make a statement on. 

The real problem here is your diet at large, not the snacks. Joshua gives you some really good 'small meal' ideas that can substitute as snacks, but if you do not have an overall satisfying diet, you are going to continue to revert back to old habits. You are working for your diet right now. Your diet should instead work for you. The first thing to note is that you don't necessarily have to count calories. If you are not actively attempting to eliminate fat or build muscle, I would go so far as to say counting calories is pointless overhead. As long as you don't notice your weight fluctuating under a new diet that's all you need. Your small meal <-> large meal cycle sounds like you are attempting to limit yourself to meals that lack the nutrition your body requires to thrive. They might be too small, they might be the wrong foods, they might simply not have enough nutrients in them. I don't know for sure because I haven't seen your diet. However, here are a few things you can bear in mind when reviewing your diet. 

Once you've gotten to the point where you mostly know what to do in order to make yourself feel and look better and stronger, and your exercise is in the context of being fun leisure time, you will eagerly look forward to your workouts and feel annoyed when you have to skip them. At this point you have a very sustainable situation where you no longer have to put forth effort to exercise; you'll just do it automatically. These goals should be hit and surpassed as you feel comfortable. Breaking yourself of fast food may take 1-2 weeks, and that's perfectly fine. You may want to completely master the kitchen before you touch your workout. You may want to tackle both simultaneously. It may take a year or more to really change everything. There's no good pace or bad pace, fast or slow. It's all up to you, it's the destination that matters. The journey is all yours. Hoping to see you around here more often (and with a permanent account) so we can help you work out the particulars when the times come!
