This formula can also be used for track events by setting and . Implementation For any developers I have created a PHP library to calculate points. You might also be interested to inspect the source even if you have to do this in another programming language. 

This is a question only about the statistical representation of power plays. When looking at team statistics (example), there are numbers that describe teams efficiency in power plays and penalty killing. In the linked example Denmark had an advantage 29 times and scored 10 goals thus having 34.48% powerplay efficiency. But how do they get the "29"? It is clearly not the amount of penalties as in the penalty killing table Canada has had 29 disadvantages while actually having earned 35 penalties. It is obvious that a 5-man team playing 2 minutes against team that has one player sent off on a minor penalty is a powerplay, but I am concerned about some trickier cases: 

And all the smarts are within knowing the coefficients. But let's start with something simpler to understand what's going on. Track events In track events the result is measured against a reference time. Your improvement with respect to the reference is then squared and multiplied by a certain factor that converts squared seconds to points. Example Let's consider 100m in outdoor for men. The reference time for this event is 17 seconds in the 2017 edition. Suppose John ran the distance in 11.78 seconds. That is 5.22 seconds better than the reference time. John's result is thus equivalent to 24.63 * 5.22^2 = 952 points (just drop the digits following the decimal point at the end). The 24.63 is a coefficient specific to this event. The formula for track events can be expressed like this: 

The unmatched bets are given by the prices 1.01 in and 1000.0 in . So, 988.15/784.54=1.2595278..., and Betfair uses decimal odds, and also includes the stake (so add 1), and so this becomes the 2.56 given as the far price. There is more information at the Betfair FAQ's and the Betfair Developer Program. I can't see how they get to the near price, I think it considers bets placed on the Exchange that are not placed at an offered SP but on the final SP. EDIT I've just double-checked the figures, and they're not quite right! But the method seems sound enough, so I'll leave my post intact for the moment. 

The rate of change of acceleration is the differential of the acceleration function (the secondary acceleration). This is a fairly subtle concept, but important to understanding how your body distributes its energies efficiently. I found a paper that covers the concept of optimal pacing in running at the of American Association of Physics Teachers: Optimal pacing for running 400- and 800-m track races which covers (obviously) 400m and 800m, but I imagine the strategies are similar for 100m and 200m. Note that the world record for 100m is faster for the 150m race where we measure from 50m to the finish. This is because the first 50m allows the athlete to build momentum, and therefore not having to start from 'cold' and not having spent all their energy, they can travel the next 100m quicker. Usain Bolt ran 100m in 8.72 seconds this way (5.64s at 50m, 14.36s at 150m): Usain Bolt 150m Manchester 2009 

I am not an expert, merely a viewer. But as far as I understand - as soon as the replacement player touches the ice, he is "in" and the other player is "out" even if he still touches the ice. When the replacement player jumps on, the leaving player may not touch the puck or otherwise participate in the game as this will be called "too many men on ice" and will be penalized. That is why I believe he is counted out of the game immediately as the replacement is on ice and thus the replacement would get counted in statistics for time on ice and +/-. 

Edit As this question is pretty much a duplicate, I will specify that I am interested to find the interpretation that is used by IIHF as in the linked example. The IIHF rulebook defines some of the statistics, but does not define this one. I initially asked without specifying IIHF rules because I expected that there would be a common and accepted understanding of the statistic. I was aware of the NCAA rulebook, I just don't really believe that IIHF tournaments and different national leagues follow the NCAA definitions and there should be either the accepted or at least the IIHF definition of counting advantageous/disadvantageous situations. 

General formula The other events have one more event-dependant coefficient. But first, the result is shifted by a number (similar to comparing with reference in track events). The shifted result is then squared and multiplied by a factor. And this is then shited by another number. The formula can be expressed like this: 

Betfair's odds system is somewhat different to the more conventional bookmakers. They allow punters to bet against each other. A punter has two choices, one is to back an event for a win, the other is to back the event not to happen. The latter is called a lay bet. Punters can set their own odds, stake and bet type, and then wait for another punter to match this bet. This punter (the matcher) agrees to payout if the punter is right. If the punter is wrong, the matcher wins the punters stake. Betfair then use the information from the matched betting process to determine the starting price (SP). The starting price is used for a different betting system, called the Exchange, and offers fixed odds, namely the starting price. Until the market is actually closed, the starting price can only be estimated, and Betfair have two methods for this, the far price and the near price. The far price is calculated using the unmatched bets, as the matched bets are between punters who have agreed a mutually acceptable price, and therefore can be considered as separate bets from unmatched bets. Using the data: 

In a Doubles match you must serve between the Short Service Line and the Doubles Long Service Line, and in a Singles match, you must serve between the Service Line and the Singles Long Service Line, also known as the Back Boundary Line. There is an exception however, for Para-badminton wheelchair Classes singles, the Doubles Long Service Line is used, with the Doubles Sideline and only half the court.
