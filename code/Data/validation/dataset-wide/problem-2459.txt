It's not something physical that is transferred. It's information. You don't have to take out the harddisk from one computer and place it in another to use Skype there. You just need to copy the Skype software and your previous history onto it. The new physical computer is completely different from the old one. But it's only the software that gets transferred. When you start it, the Skype appears as real as the previous one, and with the previous state too. But it's still not permanent, and is the result of the interaction between many processes. The idea that thinking about New York takes about as much time as thinking about Singapore or heavan, is found in Milindapanha 3.7.4. 

Exactly! For the very same reason, the Buddha said "Enough, headman, put that aside. Don't ask me that" and refused to answer the question the first time. An actor shouldn't be put off or judged as being a bad person in public. This will take them away from the dhamma. After all, acting by itself is not bad. It's about intentions. 

It appears that the simplest way to identify unskillful thoughts and actions, is whether they are imbued with the three poisons or not. And for skillful thoughts and actions, it's the opposite. In the Vitakkasanthana Sutta, we find that unskillful thoughts imbued with desire/ greed, aversion/ hatred, or delusion have to be removed. In the Vina Sutta: 

You used to desire stuff from the world before you understood the Dhamma. After you understood the Dhamma, you can and will still desire stuff from the world. The only difference is you do it in accordance with the Middle Way, the Noble Eightfold Path, the five precepts and principles of virtue (sila). You don't suddenly stop desiring all stuff because they are impermanent. Rather, when you desire stuff, you do so with an understanding that they are all impermanent and suffering. What is worth desiring? This understanding. 

On the other hand, excessive exercise either for vanity or as an addiction (see here and here for the case of running addiction), are not considered skillful. In case you are afflicted with exercise addiction, the Buddha has a remedy in the Sukhamala Sutta: 

So, it is inaccurate to say that the Buddha taught to stop thinking altogether (when you're not meditating). He only taught to remove unskillful thoughts. Constantly ensuring that you don't have unskillful thoughts, is considered a practice of heedfulness (or appamada). Please see this question for details. 

While this answer focuses on mindfulness-based medical therapies that are derived from Buddhist meditation techniques, it does not directly promote original Buddhist meditation practices, for medical therapy. This Feb 2015 article from Huffington Post reports that: 

You can read on in the same section, the story of Faxian, and how he obtained the story of the Buddha's almsbowl from an Indian monk. Monius writes further on pages 96 - 97: 

I think the conviction follower and faith follower refers to the same thing. The faith follower also has faith and conviction in the impermanence of various phenomena, according to SN25: 

What you describe here is basically known as a householder or the head of a household in old times, and maybe even today. The Sigalovada Sutta has plenty of good advice: 

Also, we can assume that adult men and women who no longer stay under the care of their parents and become independent, would no longer fall under the category of being protected by their parents. And vice versa. So, while the definition of sexual misconduct has not become obsolete, it has become "updated", so to speak.

This is where having a good living teacher nearby is helpful and you must ask them questions. In the Alagaddupama Sutta, the Buddha says: 

To answer the question of "why are they significant to some Buddhists but not others?", I would say that some Buddhists are not interested in the psychological and metaphorical interpretations of the six realms, because they take the six realms to be real places that beings are reborn into. And why do these Buddhists assume the six realms are literally existent places? They assume so because the Buddha said so. In the Janussonin Sutta, Janussonin asks the Buddha whether deceased relatives would receive the gifts (I guess food) offered to them? The Buddha says that deceased relatives would not receive the gifts offered to them, if they were reborn in non-hungry-shade realms. To quote an example: 

According to the Acintita Sutta, the precise working out of the result of karma is not to be conjectured about, otherwise it will bring madness and vexation to anyone who conjectured about it. 

This question is answered in Ven. Yuttadhammo's booklet "How To Meditate" in "Chapter One: What Is Meditation" referenced below. The additional foundations of mindfulness after body, are feeling, thoughts and dhammas (mental objects). Concerning feelings, if you feel happy or calm, acknowledge it as "happy, happy" or "calm, calm". Concerning thoughts, when your mind drifts away, usually pondering about the past or future, as soon as you recognize it, acknowledge it as "thinking, thinking". The idea here is to detach from them and not cause you to react to them. For e.g. if you remember some past unpleasant event, it will make you feel unhappy. But through mindfulness, you just acknowledge and let it go. As soon as you realize that you are thinking and acknowledge it, the thinking might stop. Concerning mental objects, the example given in the excerpt is only the five hindrances. But there are also others. For more information on the Foundations of Mindfulness, please read this essay entitled "The Way of Mindfulness" by Ven. Soma Thera. 

If you don't have a pull factor (natural inclination), then you need a push factor. These are the two factors of motivation. Suppose your doctor tells you that you have early stage of lung cancer. He tells you not to worry because it can be easily treated due to early detection, but you must give up smoking for good. So, what do you do? Give up smoking of course. You tried before and failed, but now you have a push factor. 

In "Ministering to the Sick and the Terminally Ill", Lily de Silva quotes the Buddha as exhorting monks to care for and look after other monks: 

Also from Cetana Sutta (SN 12.38) below, we see that intention (cetana) provides a landing point for the continuation of karmic consciousness. 

Please see this answer on karma, rebirth and effects of karma on this life and future lives. From the Nibbedhika Sutta: 

The Kusita-Arambhavatthu Sutta (AN8.80) provides eight grounds for the arousal of energy. In the original Pali version, it appears that the word used is "viriya". 

When one obtains the Dhamma eye, and attains stream-entry, he would only have at most, seven remaining lifetimes. The Dhamma eye is explained as the ability to see firsthand and experientially, the impermanence of the five aggregates and dependent origination. This is obviously an example in the Pali Canon that at least some thoughts or knowledge could cross over into the next life. In this case, it is the strong and irrevocable inclination towards the Dhamma in future lives, due to the opening of the Dhamma eye. Also see this question and this answer. Some say that child prodigies bring with them the strong inclinations of the immediate previous life, but I think that cannot be found in the scripture, and the Buddha would not bother to answer this (parable of the poisoned arrow, parable of the simsapa leaves, etc.). 

All compounded and/ or conditioned things are impermanent or changing. This applies to the five aggregates, physical objects, matter, energy, physical space, time, most mental concepts and ideas etc. All matter can be broken down to energy. Energy can be converted to matter. That we know from Einstein's E=mc2. Matter can convert into different forms and so can energy. Physical space and time can be warped by matter. This we know from Einstein's Theory of General Relativity. Nibbana is not impermanent. The Buddha's Dhamma (teachings) is also not impermanent. These things are not conditioned or compounded. They do not depend on anything else. However, all things including Nibbana, Buddha's teachings, matter, physical space, time, thoughts, concepts are not self. There is no permanent, standalone, independent thing called self, just as you cannot find a thing called music when you breakdown a musical instrument into its constituent parts. Please also see this answer. 

The goal in Buddhism is the end of suffering. But why do you want to reach the end of suffering? The reason is to attain the only permanent happiness, which is Nibbana. So, the mission in Buddhism is really the pursuit of happiness. The Buddha discovered that both over-indulgence and over-asceticism are not conducive to the path to the end of suffering. So, he prescribed the middle way through the Noble Eightfold Path. If you follow the middle way, you can have long term, medium term and short term goals of happiness. The long term goal associated with this mission is attaining Nibbana (permanent happiness). It might take multiple births, maybe even aeons to achieve this. The medium term goal would be to try to achieve: at least stream entry for Theravada and strong cultivation of Bodhicitta for Mahayana. You can also get more info on stream entry in this YouTube video talk. The short term goal would be to try to achieve and maintain "materialistic" happiness in this life and future lives (which includes avoiding unfortunate rebirths). At the very minimum, you need to keep the five precepts with heedfulness (appamada). Going a little further, you need to practise more of virtue (sila) with heedfulness (appamada). This short term goal is described in the Ittha Sutta: 

Your fear is based on his wrong view that on achieving nirvana, you would cease to exist, or as you wrote, "I am afraid of never being able to come back." Ven. Sariputta corrected Yamaka and Yamaka now understood: 

From Bhikkhu Bodhi's discussion on the first precept, we find some comments on the varying gravity of the kamma of killing: 

Here are some advice given by Ajaan Fuang, and recorded by his student, Thanissaro Bhikku. These should be relevant to your case. Basically, don't get attached to any experiences caused by meditation. Just observe them, learn from them, then let go and go beyond. 

If someone insults you and you don't take it in personally, then it "goes back" to that person. Similarly, any kind of ill-will from others should not be taken personally. From the Akkosa Sutta: 

So, from the Buddha's perspective, not many would be qualified to truly understand the dhamma when he first taught it. This would explain why it does not become wildly popular in his time. Like some other religions, Buddhism got adopted by the masses due to being endorsed by the rulers who have accepted it. 

If every person on one side of the Earth jumps at the same time, it will not change the rotation of the Earth. Similarly, the electrical and/or electromagnetic energy in or of your brain, while perceptible using EEG or other such instruments, does not make any noticeable difference in the physical world, in or out of meditation. It's relatively weak. 

We should not underestimate how "natural" it is for the masses to indulge in sensual pleasures. From the Magandiya Sutta: 

From this, it is widely assumed that to end suffering, we must end craving and that's it. However, according to SN45.179 and SN45.180, it is not just craving that must be ended, but also the ten fetters, through the Noble Eightfold Path. 

In the Theravada tradition, the orthodox doctrine based on the Abhidhamma states that there is no intermediate state between births, that rebirth-linking consciousness instantaneously results in a new birth without any gaps. However, the above sutta implies that it is possible to have an intermediate state that is sustained by craving. So, my question is: does SN44.9 imply an intermediate state between births, or is there an alternative interpretation for it? 

The Buddha himself did not cease having thoughts, although he was fully enlightened. Please see this question for details. In this answer, there is a quote from the Ayacana Sutta, where it says: 

The Theravada school teaches the thirty one planes of existence. These 31 planes are separated into three major categories: 

You can use the dhamma or the teachings, as a guide, and then you can discover for yourself. If you explore on your own without leveraging on the teachings, you might not make much progress. But using the teachings as a guide, you can deepen your knowledge, enhance your practice and make more progress. If possible, get a teacher. According to the Attadiipaa Sutta: 

After reading the answer from @Samadhi, I think I have a better idea of what Luminous Mind, or Luminous Consciousness is. One interesting story is of Chuang Tzu. He dreamt one day of being a butterfly flying through a garden. When he awoke, he wasn't sure whether he was dreaming that he is the butterfly or whether the butterfly is dreaming that it is him. But what is common between the two experiences? Both had different identities, but the same base consciousness or awareness of itself. It is said that this is the same for all beings. So much so, that it is often conjectured in some other religions or philosophies, that this is permanent in the universe, or is a universal consciousness. This might also be the meaning of the Vedic statement "prajñānam brahma" or "Brahman is Consciousness". The luminous mind may be similar to the Hindu concept of prajñā. However, from the suttas, the Buddha denies that there is such a permanent or universal consciousness, by defining the concept of "eye consciousness", "ear consciousness" (see here) etc. In other words, the "luminous mind", while being common for all, is not permanent or universal, because it arises and falls according to dependent origination. But it is the base consciousness or mind of all beings, which is not defiled by anything. The base consciousness, just like the sense of sight, is common for all of us, but it arises and falls, just like sight, based on dependent origination. It is a common experience, but it is not permanent and it is not all linked together in the universe. This may be the Buddhist perspective, as opposed to the Hindu perspective. 

As long as one craves for life and existence, one is subject to endless birth, death, rebirth, experiencing endless ups and downs of pleasure and pain, gaining and losing loved ones, having unfulfilled desires etc. Nothing that is joyful lasts forever. Nothing that is sorrowful can be avoided forever. Just imagine undergoing these for eternity without rest. Not just as a human, but also as an animal, ghost, angel (deva) etc. This is the entirety of suffering (dukkha). Not just the part that relates to pain and sorrow. Such suffering should motivate you to get rid of it, just as the good prince was motivated to leave his comfortable life in search of the end of suffering.
