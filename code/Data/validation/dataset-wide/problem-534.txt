As an aside, what makes you think the BMX stuff will be better? BMX stuff is usually designed to be robust rather than the absolute best. Your V-brakes are almost certainly good enough. 

I'm assuming this is your bike and you really mean that you've removed the fork from the bike as disassembling the fork isn't really something you do by mistake. The specs I found say that you've got a threadless stem and sealed bearing headset. This is easy to reattach. There are 3 or 4 bolts you need to be concerned with. One right at the top, that goes through a metal disc about an inch and a half wide. This is the preload bolt . Also, on your stem there will be either 2 or 3 that clamp the stem to the top of your forks. To reassemble, find the following bits: 

To keep the chainline as central as possible, it might be best to go with a tripple crank and use the center position for your chain ring and the outer for a bash guard. A single speed crank has a wider chainline and is biased towards the outside/smallest cog in the casette. That said, I've just built a 1x9 with Stylo 1.1 cranks and SRAM X0 casette / derailler. No dropped chains yet, with just the bash guard, and it's very smooth. 

Works fine. Not as secure as a clutch, but secure enough to not be a pain. With a plain ring, I'd drop the chain at least once a lap of XC racing. Narrow-wide made it a once in every few weeks, and I don't think I've ever dropped a chain with a cutch. 

The throw will be controlled by the total gap between pads and disc. For a short throw, a small gap, pads screwed a long way in, for a longer throw pads further apart, pads screwed out. 

I've just had a quick read of the BB7 / 5 service manual. The only reference to not using barrel adjusters is for pad wear on page 11. Mechanical disc brakes have a pad wear adjustment, usually on the outboard side of the calliper. This should be used to account for pad wear and not the barrel adjuster. 

As far as I'm aware, at these pressures, there'll be no difference in performance. A bigger issue might be the rim. The value hole will be either Shrader or Presta sized and will either not fit a Shrader or be hard work to seal with a Presta. 

I do trail riding with some technical elements, and I have decided to upgrade my normal helmet to some sort of a full-face helmet. I have seen some sturdy-looking helmets, which resemble the motorcycle ones (example). However, their ventilation looks bad, so I don't want these. I am interested in the lighter variant, which looks like a normal helmet with a chin guard attached to it (example) - chin guard may or may not actually be removable. So, if I get the latter type of helmet, do I get significantly better protection, comparing to non-full-face helmets? Specifically, will it protect me from a direct face-plant? Is there a significant risk of the chin guard snapping and hurting me? Does it matter if the chin guard is made of metal or plastic? 

I am practicing the technique of cornering, where one must lean the bicycle into the turn, while keeping the body more or less vertical. A (possibly exaggerated) picture I found on Google: 

My problem is, when I am riding, they sometimes slip down, reducing protection of my knees. This mostly happens because of vibration, while I am riding down (it's when I need them the most), but sometimes also when I am pedaling up. If I fall down when my guards have slipped, it's as if I had no protection at all. I noticed that on some days I get lucky with my straps and they sort of "stick" to my legs and don't move, while on other days I constantly readjust them, and they slip all the time. How can I fix this problem? I am willing to buy a different type of guards if that would solve my problem (however, I don't want soft/flexible guards - plastic has better protection). 

There is that cool maneuver that lets you do a very sharp turn (90° or even 180°) in very tight situations, like descending two flights of staircases (in town) or narrow and very steep winding trails (in nature). It involves pressing the front brake so the front wheel locks, and the rear wheel rises into the air. You would then place the rear wheel back down wherever you want, disengage the front brake, and continue riding in the new direction. I saw an owner of a bike shop do this once, but have seen it only in online videos since then. So, how is this maneuver called? I saw names like "endo" or "stoppie", but "endo" seems to refer to accidents, and "stoppie" seems to mean a "trick", only done for the cool look. Does there exist a name that implies doing this in a mundane way, like when one's commute route just appears to have an angled staircase in it? 

You're mixing up two different concepts. The damper, which is what slows things down. The spring, which is what holds the weight and absorbs shocks. The damper is usually hydraulic, oil being forced through a small hole. The spring is either a coil or pressurised air. Without a damper, you'll have a very bouncy ride and without a spring, you'll have a very stiff ride. The 2 work together to provide a nice ride. Also, those 2 bikes target different styles of riding. The Slash is an Enduro bike and the Voltage a Freeride bike. 

The length of the cage on the bottom of your derailleur that holds the two small cogs is what decides the size of cassette you can use on your bike. There are 2 numbers that matter, the max size and tooth capacity. Max size is is the largest cog the derailleur is designed to clear and the capacity is the largest difference between the small-small and big-big gear ratios that it can take up the slack in. -- Since your bike came stock with a 11-26, I'm going to guess it has a short cage derailleur, the largest cog this can accept is 28. SRAM road derailleurs come in short and medium cage, and have a max cog size of 28 & 32 and a max capacity of 33 & 37 respectively. You may also need to change your chain, not a bad idea anyway with a new cassette. 

Yes, it will affect you, but I doubt you'll notice the difference. Some people do feel fait afterwards, but I believe this is related to blood pressure rather than red blood cell count and your body can replace the fluid relatively quickly, so have a cup of tea and a chat before you leave and you should be ok. When I was giving regularly, they asked if you were going to be operating heavy machinery later that day. If you tick that they'll ask you about it and give you better advice than someone anonymous on the internet... 

The British Cycling Technical Regulations make no mention of limiting in section 3.3 Gear Restrictions. However BC themselves give instructions on using the limit screws in this explanatory leaflet. I suspect it's up to your charm and the mood of the commissaire. 

A Twist Resist will let you hold the spoke and resist the twisting. They're designed for holing spokes to prevent windup and spinning on straight pulls. The internet says you can use a cable holder in a pinch, or even some smooth jawed pliers. I'd be tempted to try thread lock on the hub end as a quick and dirty solution. 

I would suggest double checking the lock ring on your cassette and the cones on your rear hub. You may also check if your rear derailleur hangar is bent. And if it's replaceable it could be loose - if so, remove it, clean the screws and threads, and use loctite on reinstall. Check your quick release. Bent frame? With regard to your point about pawls, I actually experience an interesting issue with my freehub (Novatec) where it can "pop" after freewheeling. I don't know what causes it, but I think it has something to do with a ring of some sort that holds the pawls in place (and being a cheap hub.) Have you tried removing the cassette and free hub to inspect the pawls? You said everything is new - what about derailleur cables and housings? Are housings seated properly in the cable stops? Does your problem only tend to occur on shifting to a higher gear, suggesting that the cable may not be able to glide smoothly in the housing, keeping the derailleur indexed lower so that the chain is "riding up on the sprockets"? Chain slip seems unlikely with new cassette and chain. Riding up on a chainring seems unlikely too - you'd probably hear the chain rubbing on the rings all the time, but double check for a bent ring and any bent teeth that could catch the chain. Can the rear derailleur pulleys rotate freely? If they stick it would cause the derailleur to put tension on the chain until the sticky pulley is overcome by force. On a similar topic, take your rear wheel out and spin it in your hands (holding it by the cones) to check your hub bearings. This is just a brain dump from my own experience, your note about moderate load does lead me to rear derailleur and hanger issues though. One more thing: I assume there's three chain rings, does this happen when you're in the small ring and smallest cog, middle ring and largest or smallest cog, or big ring and largest cog? 

As others have suggested, bike fit, padded shorts, anatomical saddle, etc. When it comes to bike fit, consider the tilt of the saddle: try tilting the nose of the saddle down. If it's above level, or even level, you'll exacerbate nerve compression with the small surface area of the nose. Don't tilt it too far down or as you slip forward you'll constantly be pushing yourself backward on the saddle. Further, examine the position of the saddle relative to the BB. If the saddle is too far back, you'll be sitting on the nose - try moving the saddle forward such that your bum is resting on the wider section of the saddle. Note that saddle position and tilt can affect the saddle height. So write down your saddle height before messing around and readjust afterward if necessary. Also consider your body position. Are you resting your upper body on your handle bars, or are you supporting it with your core? This will affect hip rotation. The former causes you to roll your hips forward putting more pressure on your perineum. The latter will rotate your hips back relieving pressure on your perineum and resting more on your ischium (I think that's the bone you'd be sitting on.) You can work on your position by keeping your elbows rotated down, relieving weight from your hands, making a conscious effort to use your core, and a conscious effort to feel the effect of hips rotated forward and backward (as far as I can tell, rotating your hips back is done more with your lower abs, similar to thrusting your pelvis forward.) All this considered, I still get numbness. I compete, I ride a bazillion km/year, I've got padded shorts and an anatomical saddle. Whatever. Likely because I don't support my upper body with my core and roll my hips forward. It's an aggressive position that I like, so I mitigate the issue by occasionally standing - if I'm on flats I switch to a high gear and turn over a low cadence, or I'll just rest my thigh on my saddle and coast (I do this a lot riding in traffic approaching red lights and stop signs.) 

I have accidentally removed the suspension fork from my bicycle (Trek Remedy 8). I was trying to take off just the handlebar, but was distracted for a moment and unscrewed the wrong bolt. How safe would it be to assemble it back without going to my LBS (it will probably take them some much time, and I would not like to miss riding on my weekend)? I have no experience in suspension fork servicing; my idea is just to use common sense to screw parts back in. It doesn't seem that the fork has any ball bearings. 

Sometimes I want to ascend a steep (say, 50%) slope, where is impossible to ride and awkward to push/pull the bike. I tried various ways of carrying the bike: 

Increase the pressure in your tires (this was mentioned in comments). This will make it less comfortable, but will decrease rolling resistance. Also, try to optimize your route from a commuter's point of view: use smooth roads where possible. And if there are significant changes in height on your route, try to optimize them too. 

I might need to replace my rims soon. I've had frequent problems with breakage of spokes, so it's a good opportunity to buy stronger rims and/or spokes. What characteristics should I look for if I want to fix this problem? Should I pay attention more to the spokes or to the rim? Some details: I don't do racing, so weight is not an issue. I do trail riding, including jumps. I have disk brakes. 

I have experienced a strange failure of my brake. I was descending a steep smooth road, using only my front brake (my rear brake was broken; it was an unplanned bail from a route). I tried keeping the speed low, so i could jump off the bike at any moment. After going this way for maybe 2 minutes, I stopped briefly to let some car pass (so released the brake for a few seconds). As I continued to descend, I pressed the brake, and surprisingly, its handle went all the way to the handlebar without doing any braking! So I immediately jumped off. I didn't believe at first the bad luck I had, but then I pressed again and again on the brake (not while riding now), and gradually it returned to normal; after 1 minute it would give full braking force again. So I wonder, is this an expected way a brake would fail while overheating? I heard that it would start to stink really bad before it became dangerous to ride, so I didn't worry about overheating. The model of my brake is Hayes Nine.
