I have just read about the "real intertemporal" model of a macroeconomy in Macroeconomics by Stephen Williamson. I am concerned about how it says any increase in government spending, even if it is equal to an increase in taxes, increases the output of the economy. This is because taxes don't reduce private consumption spending as much as government spending increases demand. But, if I extend this idea to the extreme, where government involvement is exceedingly high, I don't understand why people will carry on spending more than they earn, with high taxes and no way to pay off their debt. It seems like the autonomous component of private spending is problematic when thinking about tax (as opposed to an equilibrium), because this theoretically causes people to overspend in comparison to their income. The deduction is that, with any positive multiplier (not just one greater than 1 as mentioned in the textbook), the more the government intervenes in the economy, the higher the GDP will be, ad infinitum, so that this model encourages higher and higher government involvement. In reality, socialist countries such as Russia have had lower output than free-market countries such as the United States, and it is well known that government bureaucracies are more inefficient than the private sector. What I'm checking here is where the theory leads. I assume this must be a Keynesian-type model, because it encourages government involvement, and that other models give a different story (neoclassical perhaps?). As a public administration student as well, I don't like it how government spending is treated so differently to private spending, and this separation here seems to be problematic (as assuming that government departments are efficient in comparison to the private sector). 

which you can see has transitivity since the curves do not intersect, convexity, and completeness (excluding the line $y=0$) as $U$ can take on any real number. The 'more-is-better' property follows from Mick's comment that as $x$ or $y$ increases, $U$ unequivocally increases. 

However, due to the firm's variable costs, output is always greater than that at the turning point of the marginal cost curve. 

Because the money market is the basis of the LM relation, this shifts the LM curve upwards as the interest rate increases (shown as the increase from $LM_1$ to $LM_2$). Higher interest rates lead to lower real investment (i.e. investment in capital, land, labour and enterprise), government spending and consumption. This is equivalent to a movement upwards along the IS curve. The IS relation shows equilibrium in the goods market, which is given by $Y=C+I+G$. $I(i)$ is a (decreasing) function of the interest rate, and the interest rate increasing is what causes real investment to drop. It is a negative relationship because higher interest rates make it harder to borrow money to finance investments. In our situation, government spending decreases because the cost of credit for them increases, but rising Treasury bond interest rates also raises other interest rates throughout the economy due to competition, which then reduces private investment. The result is a decrease in the growth rate of output. The drop in output actually dampens the increase in the demand for money, because income decreases. So, the hike in interest rates is attenuated as output growth slows down. This can be reflected in the money market as a downwards shift in the demand for money curve from $D_{M_2}$ to $D_{M_3}$. Another thing I want to check is if it is fine to think of there being only one interest rate in the graph on the left, due to the way central bank interest rate and other financial instrument interest rates rise due to arbitrage. The interest rate on Treasury bills is obviously what is affected, so is it fine to think of the demand for 'money' (is that demand for all the money in the entire economy?) as interacting with that interest rate? I presume that reduced investor confidence is a fairly standard problem to model, yet I'm not so sure about how I've done it. 

Your interpretation of the coefficient on Var1 or Var2 is the effect that variable has on Y if the person is in the base category. I.e., if all the categorical variable dummies were 0. You are not looking at variation within each category. You are assuming that two observations within the same category but different villages are independent, unlike what you assume for two observations within the same village. The categorical dummies are there to hold them constant as you look at the other variables. 

The demand curve is a function that shows the relationship between price and quantity demanded. This curve is made up of an infinite number of points, with each point corresponding to two pieces of information: a price and the quantity that would be demanded at that price. If you consider a different price, you only need to then consider a different point on this curve - so there would be a movement along the curve if the price changes. We say that price is endogenous to the model. When the demand curve was constructed, some other factors were assumed to be constant. These are the factors that do not appear directly on the graph (like price), but are behind the scenes. So, for example, if you want to consider how government expenditure affects a demand curve, you would need to draw a different demand curve based on the different level of G, because G is assumed to be constant for any one particular demand curve. We say that these other factors are exogenous to the model. The reason why taxes on production shift the supply curve upwards is because they increase the cost of production. Those costs need to be added onto the price of the product, so the price increases for any particular quantity. 

Assume that the United States decided to hold more yuan in the federal reserve. Which processes does that involve? I assume there is some sort of electronic exchange between the two central banks where dollars are exchanged for yuan. What happens physically? I assume that the Fed will only need to hold a portion (say, 10%) of the reserves as currency, and the other 90% will be just based on the credibility of the bank. Does that mean that the currency worth 10% of the exchange needs to be loaded in a special plane and flown from China to the US and vice versa? How often do those sorts of plane trips happen? 

The tangent lines are drawn because they are trying to get you to think about the magnitude of the slope at each point on the production function. The marginal product of labour is the derivative of the production function, and will look like a decreasing function when drawn graphically, starting off with high values for low levels of labour, then decreasing to low values for high levels of labour. This corresponds to how the slope of the production function starts off steep and then gets flatter. Because the gradient decreases, this is called 'diminishing' returns. We assume capital is constant when looking at this graph. 

There is a school of thought that says that people unconsciously use cost-benefit analyses in their relationships with other people. In this idea, people show kindness only because they anticipate getting rewarded for those acts, so it is in their own self-interest to do so. Monetizing small tasks takes time, and then collecting money for tasks done takes more time. So people do this mentally instead, moreso by feelings than rational calculation. At the level of an interpersonal relationship, words and feelings matter whereas in a business relationship, only tasks and services or goods rendered matter. Thus, monetizing the countless miniscule interactions that take place in a personal relationship would be impossible and there needs to be some degree of trust to replace that. At the level of a firm, an employment contract stipulates generally what somebody is being paid for. It is more efficient for the company to let individuals decide what to do in a day, or to instruct them to undertake certain tasks (depending on the organizational structure of the firm) than to spend time haggling for a price at which they should be paid in order to carry out various parts of their jobs. As other users have commented, when a firm gets too large, there are diseconomies of scale as it becomes too difficult to control a large number of workers. Then work tends to be contracted out to other firms and the use of money comes in. However, token economies work well in situations such as mental asylums, to encourage those people to undertake tasks and follow rules. 

I think the best way for an individual citizen to improve their country's economic development is to raise their productivity, while also following ethical standards. "Raising productivity" is a very traditional economic viewpoint, and it basically requires one to move away from rural or subsistence living and towards activities that contribute to society, as measured by the income that you generate. But, I think there also needs to be a focus on long-term developmental outcomes, which may not necessarily be tied to economic profit because of negative externalities. I haven't done a lot of research into the lives of poor people, but after reading some chapters from Banerjee and Duflo's Poor Economics, I would say that the economy loses out when people are not persistent, motivated, or when they make economically irrational decisions. For example, poor people in India do not use the most cost-effective treatment for diarrhea (rehydration liquid with salt and sugar) because they do not trust and are not accustomed to Western medicine. Another example is that poor people in Morocco who can't afford food buy televisions, but I understand the reason for this. The reason is that poor people cannot be expected to cut out all luxuries in their lives, because they also need things that make their life bearable and pleasurable. If poor people didn't buy expensive food and other luxury items, the generations below them might rise out of poverty sooner, but such a process takes a long time. Income-earners would not want to forego a better life for themselves just so that their children's children will not live in poverty. All in all, I advise you to become a change agent in your community. Strive to motivate others to do work. Technology will help, so you will need to try to find out what the most technologically advanced way of doing your work is. That knowledge comes with education, which may be difficult to access in your situation, but nevertheless try to find it. Lastly, public participation in governance is important for economic development, so try to actively participate in your country's governance. 

I am doing an essay on how a sovereign debt rating downgrade to junk status affects the economy. I wanted to use a theoretical framework to think about it, and seeing as an increase in the interest rate is involved, I decided to use the IS-LM model. Please tell me if the following is correct or not. I think it's a bit unconventional to shift the LM curve when money demands shifts, but the reason why I do that is because output was not the driving force of the shift in money demand. As I understand it, if output increases, that increases money demand, which is a movement along the LM curve. However, in this case, investor confidence affects the interest rate directly, without an initial effect on output. That is why I have shifted the LM curve upwards. I presented the model as follows. Investor confidence drops with the news of a rating downgrade, so financial investors sell their bonds, which increases the demand for money, and decreases the prices of bonds. Because the prices of bonds decrease, interest rates on those bonds increase. Also, new bonds will have higher interest rates because they are seen as more risky. This is shown graphically in the money market model below as the first increase in money demand from $D_{M_1}$ to $D_{M_2}$. (I find it a bit confusing to think about foreign investors demanding more money (like M1), because I think they would want to sell the rand in exchange for their own currency, but I think this is true for the domestic economy.) 

Supply will increase, as more money becomes available for the government to lend out to borrowers. This is the opposite of the crowding out effect, as mathtastic says, because investment increases. 

Here is a so-called thought experiment. Suppose the inflation rate is negative, the nominal interest rate slightly negative, and the real interest rate positive (call it $r$). I think people would rationally make the same savings decisions as if they were in an economy with a real interest rate of $r$, but positive inflation. But, the liquidity trap is about the nominal interest rate. It says that the nominal interest rate can't drop below zero. I'm trying to understand why, and I think the question can be framed in terms of what banks will decide to do with bonds they own. When the real interest rate is positive, banks will continue to create money and buy bonds, no matter what the long run nominal interest rate is. If the real interest rate were negative, banks would not buy any more bonds, would get less money when selling their current bonds, and they would start to run out of liquidity (no matter what the nominal interest rate is). 

Your work for 1 and 2 is correct. For 3, look at each segment individually. There are two points which have an elasticity of $-1$, one on each segment. 

I think one can answer this question by looking at what affects saving rates. Age According to the life-cycle model of household savings*, young and old people save less than middle-aged people. Young people who are starting a new family have many expenses and a lower income due to lack of work experience. Thus, young people save less and value money more in the present (a high reservation intertemporal discount rate). Middle-aged people have a higher income and save towards their retirement (a low reservation intertemporal discount rate). Old-aged people retire and live off their savings, so they have a high reservation intertemporal discount rate. Dependants If you support more dependants, you will be shorter of money and will have a high reservation intertemporal discount rate. Investment Opportunities Better quality investments and financial institutions will improve the interest rate at which money can be saved, which increases the intertemporal discount rate at the intersection of the budget constraint line and the indifference curve of the individual. Income One would think that saving increases with income, but high-income countries actually save less than middle-income countries, but moreso than low-income countries (World Bank, data on Gross Domestic Savings (% of GDP)). So there is no obvious relationship with the level of income, but if the anticipated future level of income goes up, then people will save less (and consume more in the present) giving a higher intertemporal discount rate. *Alberto Aldo and Franco Modigliani, "The Life-Cycle Hypothesis of Saving: Aggregate Implications and Tests," American Economic Review 53, no. 1, (March 1963), 55-84.
