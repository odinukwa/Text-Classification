Getting the ball first has minimal relevance as to whether a foul has occurred. There is no reference to making contact with the ball in the section relating to Fouls and Misconduct in the Laws of the Game, but it may be considered by the referee in deciding whether contact was careless, reckless or excessively forceful. There are six offences in which contact is made with an opponent that cause a direct free kick to be awarded: 

This is probably correct, provided the defender has done so without carelessly tripping or careless challenging (e.g. with studs raised towards) the attacker. 

It is obvious that a player cannot be sent-off more than once in a match. The Laws do not explicitly state this, but it is implied in Laws 3 and 12. Law 12 - Fouls and Misconduct, Section 3 - Disciplinary Action: 

This is simply a tradition, so you will be unlikely to find an explicit reference for it. As mentioned in the other answers, ensuring the player and all other participants know who the caution or send-off signal is intended for is important, as is ensuring any player on the ground is not injured. What has not been mentioned is that for cautions, it is desirable to elicit a change in player behaviour, since they will usually be remaining on the field of play after the caution. When a player is cautioned, the referee can save themselves a potential sending-off for a second caution by trying to calm a player down and outlining to a player that they are on their final chance. Being cautioned with a (usually menacingly tall - most elite-level football referees are well over six feet tall) referee standing over you can be an intimidating and humiliating experience, and is unlikely to elicit a positive response in which the player listens to the referee. Therefore, the player is asked to stand - or the referee may offer them a hand up, so they are on equal footing with the referee and so that the interaction is respectful. The referee then explains what the caution is for, and if they feel that the player is potentially in an agitated or irrational state and likely to reoffend, reminds them that if another offence of a similar nature occurs, they will have no choice but to send them off and that they would much rather that the player stays on the field. If required by the competition rules, the referee may also ask the player's name during this stage - in most competitions, the number suffices and the name is taken from the match sheet. Such an interaction is not possible if the referee rushes in, stands over a downed player and flashes the card. Even in heated situations, a referee can at least sprint to the location of the downed player, with the card in hand without showing it. This way, other players know that punishment is coming and they should not retaliate, yet the referee still has the opportunity to attempt to improve the player's future conduct. 

In all of the above examples, the red player has committed the offence of playing in a dangerous manner. As counterexamples, here are two incidents that are not playing in a dangerous manner, but are often incorrectly called as such: 

This is not a save, since the ball is not going into the goal or very close to the goal. Since this is not a save, but is still a deliberate play of the ball, the attacker is now free to play the ball without being penalised for offside. 

If a player left the field and didn't come back, and I had no idea what for (as in the question), I believe it would be pretty safe to assume that it fit into one of the above categories. Of course, in all of these situations, if the player attempted to re-enter the field without permission, they would be cautioned - a player suddenly appearing on the field unmarked when their team has possession, or coming on to apply immediate pressure to the opposition is unfair to the opposition and must be dealt with accordingly. There are only three instances where I wouldn't implicitly grant permission for a player to leave the field without permission and would caution them, ie. when a player: 

The accepted answer is completely correct as to what action the referee should take against the goalkeeper. Furthermore, if there is now a hole in the field which is large enough to make it difficult to take a penalty kick, in addition to cautioning the goalkeeper, the referee should suspend the game and not allow the penalty kick until ground staff or someone from the home team repairs the hole (depending on the level of competition). This is not only a fairness concern for the team taking the penalty kick, but also a safety concern for players from both teams. The referee's power to suspend matches due to player infringements and for other interference is granted on p. 25 of the 2015/16 FIFA Laws of the Game: 

No, it is highly unlikely that any prominent football teams use a pitch that is close to square in shape. On page 7 of the 2015/16 FIFA Laws of the Game it states: 

This is done to avoid unnecessary collisions between attackers and defenders (particularly the goalkeeper), and large delays in having to bring the ball back to where the attacker was positioned when the ball was played for the free kick when it's completely obvious an offside offence is about to occur. 

I'm assuming by the hash, you mean the penalty mark (ie. the place from where the penalty kick is taken). You won't find any law against it because it is completely legal. It is a bit of a stretch see how this could be a problem. Any controversy here would most likely arise from the goalkeeper placing the ball on an uneven section of turf in order to impair the kicker. If this was to happen, the kicker is then within their rights to place the ball however they like (ie. on a flatter part of the penalty mark), provided it is still on the penalty mark and any readjustment is done in a timely manner. What would be illegal here, would be the goalkeeper delaying the restart of play or dissenting the decision by throwing the ball away, refusing to return to his goal line for the kick to be taken, or entering into protracted disputes over the placement of the ball. If this occurred, the referee would either verbally warn, or caution the goalkeeper for dissent or delaying the restart of play. 

This is nothing more than a poor tactic. Neither of these players can really do anything of significance until the ball has been deliberately played (other than a deliberate save) by an opponent or goes out of play. Until this happens, they're effectively leaving their team short by two players. IFAB Laws of the Game, 121.2 Offside Offence: 

Historically, the goalkeeper could be charged when holding the ball, as long as they had passed outside their goal area. However, since the great rewrite of the Laws of the Game that occurred in 1997, this is no longer the case. From Law 12 of the 1993 FIFA Laws of the Game. 

Yes, there is a safety hazard. As most players' torsos are just under 1.5m off the ground, there is a risk of damage to vital organs if a player was to fall on top of the flag, especially with great force.
