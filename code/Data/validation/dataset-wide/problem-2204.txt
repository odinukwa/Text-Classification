This let is called if the shuttle tumbles over the net and then gets caught in the net. In this situation, the shuttle has passed over the net - albeit not at speed, but tumbling, typically after striking the net cord. It happens much more often if the net is either very fine, or has holes in it. 

Yes, it is legal to change the racket during play. From the Recommendation to Technical Officials (RTTO) ยง3.5.4.2: 

Therefore, the first contact of any part of the shuttle with the floor is the one that counts. Here is a forum post from somebody who contacted the Badminton World Federation (BWF), which confirmed as much. As you mention, HawkEye's video presentation (which shows a large circle) is for the entertainment of the spectators - they probably show a circle instead of the very small point of contact because the latter would not be visible. In the first years of HawkEye's use it was not even automated; the circle was positioned by a HawkEye employee, whereas an umpire (on so-called IRS duty) decided whether the shuttle was in or out. 

Yes, but it is possible that the sport federation's olympic rules (determined in cooperation with the IOC) amend or modify this (for instance, prohibiting advertisements). 

As of writing, Saina Nehwal has 54720 points in the BWF ranking, which would comfortably give her the first in the Indian ranking on its own with 5472 Indian ranking points, easily before Anura Prabhudesai with 3247 points. However, it seems these BWF points are not included on the Badminton India ranking website. Most likely, the additional points are only counted for entering and seeding in the national championships. 

The last two/three serve variations aim to win the point outright. Just like gambits or early attacks in chess, these can be effective at lower levels, but are rare among high-level players. In contrast to chess openings, where each opening has a lot of variations one can specialize on, in badminton the difference in skill shows in the execution of each variant. Another important difference is that a badminton serve depends not only on the receiver's skill, but also (a lot) on the receiver's position, grip, and racket handling. In general, the aim in badminton is to hit the shuttle from above (especially in doubles and mixed; in singles it's not as advantageous), and conversely, to force your opponent to play an upwards shot. The serve is no exception. This is the reason why in high-level doubles almost all serves are short and descending from the moment they pass the net. A loose serve is almost certainly leading to an immediate loss of the rally. Fortunately, while there is of course always room for improvement, the short backhand serve is by far the easiest shot in the game, since it only requires minimal and simple arm/hand movement and no footwork or body coordination. The serve is understood as a neutral shot; when players have to choose whether to serve or receive at the beginning of a match, both options are popular. Any good player has a decent serve, but (especially in singles) an excellent serve is only a slight advantage, and unlikely to end the rally immediately. 

First of all, you should be aware that at professional levels, the (jump) smash is the shot to end a rally (or to prepare a kill shot). Especially in doubles, but also high-level (Men's) singles, players fight for the chance to smash downwards, i.e. try to avoid lifting as much as possible. Sometimes, the easiest way to defend against smashes is not lifting in the first place, and rather playing flat or short. This may necessitate taking shots earlier at the net then you currently are. Another aspect to watch is the distance and angle of your lift. Analyze (e.g. via video or having a friend record) where the smash started. Smashes from the midcourt or even forecort are nearly impossible to defend against. In Men's singles/doubles, if your lift did not reach the doubles service line, then it is far too short. Additionally, look at the angle of the lift: A flat shot is both easier to hit and already has more energy. If possible, your lift should come down vertically. The defensive technique begins with the proper footwork. On your forehand side, one step should be enough for sufficiently tall players. On your backhand side, you have two options: Either a small step with your non-racket-arm foot, or stepping over (i.e. body moved away from the net) with your racket-arm foot. For smashes toward the very line, you need the latter unless you are extremely tall. You have three basic options for your shot: Short, flat, and high. Unless the shot is going far to your racket-arm side, defensive shots are easier with the backhand. In singles it is usually a good idea to play a short shot, in order to gain the attack yourself, so that you can be the one smashing. However, beware of your opponent storming to the net in order to kill your defense. It is not a trick per se, but you should be able to hit longline as well as cross-court shots. The latter force your opponent to cover a great distance, and are thus usually best if you can consistently hit them. In doubles, a short defense must be quite good in order to evade the partner of the smasher. Oftentimes, it is better to counter with a flat and fast defense that goes around the front player. If your defense is angled really flat, there's a good chance that you'll end up in a neutral or even attacking situation. To train your defense, there are multiple options, depending on your level of play (and the level of skills of your coach): 

YONEX offers 8 different plastic shuttlecock products, although availability may differ depending on what region/country you're in. Depending on the market, some products may also not be available in white and yellow. Despite the picture on the YONEX homepage, the 2000 is available in yellow. The pricing and marketing suggests that the higher the number the better (= closer to feather shuttles) the flight path is. Mavis 10 to Mavis 370 look very similar. In contrast, Mavis 2000 are visibly different, more so than it you can see in the official promotion pictures. (I have never handled 500 or 600.) In my personal experience and opinion, Mavis 10, 350 and 370 feel quite similar. Anecdotally, the 10 breaks easier than the other ones, but I don't have enough data on that. Mavis 2000 feels quite different than the other ones. I feel that you get more control at the net and there's a slightly larger range of distance (i.e. you can hit it out a little bit easier, but also play it quite slow), although that may be partially a placebo effect. The Mavis 2000 breaks a little bit earlier than the 350/370, but it's still on the scale of a plastic shuttle; you can easily play multiple hours with a single shuttle. Nevertheless, the difference between a Mavis 370 and 2000 is still less than between a Mavis 2000 and a feather shuttle. If you want to stick to YONEX plastic shuttles and value good flight characteristics, the Mavis 2000 is certainly a good idea. If you want the plastic shuttle to fly like every other decent plastic shuttle, go for one of the other ones, e.g. a 350.
