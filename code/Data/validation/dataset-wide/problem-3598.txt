Just to expand a bit on another point of view. I'd agree that doing a whole body static stretching routine before/after a workout is probably not the best way to use your time, however stretching & foam rolling definitely have their uses. Obviously most professional athletes you'd expect do some amount of stretching and muscle therapy. Just a couple quick examples: 

Now we're probably not trying to get into the NFL or be the worlds strongest man so take that w/ a grain of salt. Stretching may not instantly improve performance but increased flexibility and range of motion is beneficial. If you're horribly tight, have bad posture, or poor range of motion that will definitely hinder your ideal performance. So if you need to improve it stretching, rolling, and strengthening are pretty much your only options. Some quick reads to give pros and cons to stretching and foam rolling. 

Now for planks, this is a type of static or isometric exercise that is definitely great to do as all of us could use a stronger more stable core. But when talking about overloading I understand your confusion as usually it's in reference to non-isometric exercises. If you wanted specifically to use progressive overload techniques with planks you could simply gradually increase the volume (add weight to your back), intensity (less rest between sets), frequency (more sets), or time (most obvious one). So based on all this it'd stand to reason that planks can build both these factors. I'm not super sure if your goal is to increase your plank endurance but I assume you are more leaning towards the muscle growth. There's a lot of going on in this question and you could literally write a Ph.D. thesis on these subjects. While planks are great, if you're looking to build muscle you'll also want to incorporate some more full range of motion exercises. 

I think we should start with what building muscular endurance and/or inducing hypertrophy means. They are not mutually exclusive and are different in their objective. Muscular Endurance 

So stretch/roll after or only when you feel sore? Neither or either, it really depends on what you need. I'd say most important is evaluate what you need in regards to your specific workout and overall goals. If your workout would benefit from a increased range of motion. For example you're doing Olympic or power style lifting, things like snatches, squats, dead lifts, and cleans will definitely benefit from shoulder, ankle, wrist, hip, etc. mobility. So regular rolling targeting areas and increasing your range of motion will defiantly help. If you have any areas that are overly tight or imbalanced. This may unrelated to your workout but rather something you may determine you'd benefit from. For example if your hunched over a desk all day your hips, back and shoulders likely could benefit from daily stretching and rolling. Or if a lack of mobility is preventing you from properly doing some exercises then definitely using any tool possible should be part of your daily training rather then an afterthought. Personally I used to always have one side of my back flair up when doing dead lifts or high volume on squats. This seemed to mainly be caused by my poor ankle mobility on one side and very tight hips. I've been doing daily hip opening stretches, rolling for the past 6 months and have not had any issues for the past few. It's a big topic. I'm no expert and mainly coming from a power lifting focus so keep that in mind. While I never see people doing a classic middle school stretching routine before or after a workout (usually bar or no weight warm ups and a dynamic movement routine), all the strongest most athletic guys I know do some sort mobility and maintenance routine outside of their workouts. So yeah if you're sore, tight or need some more flexibility go ahead roll it out, do some stretches before/after/both or don't see what works for you and what you can benefit from. 

You can't. Spot reduction of fat from any area of your body is not possible. You can, however, lose your overall body fat and that will surely slim down your thighs. 

Carbohydrates are the most common macronutrient that is present in our food. For the best case scenario, decrease it and not the fats and proteins. Again, how much fat, carbs or protein doesn't matter as long as you have a calorie deficit. If you wanna' lose weight and keep it off, the thing you need to keep in mind is moderation. No single food can be categorized as healthy or unhealthy. Just feed your body as you find convenient and comfortable. Eating 'healthy' 9 out of 10 times is enough for living a healthy lifestyle. 

It's not really necessary to do intermittent fasting to lose weight. If you are comfortable with it, it's fine. Just keep in mind that in the initial days, you'll feel hungry, a lot. Your body will adjust with time. 

The main factor for muscle hypertrophy is volume. It doesn't matter which order you use in your workouts while training as long as your muscles are getting sufficient stimulus for growth. As @mjb in comments as said, you there is no method which is 'better' here. I'd like to repeat the same thing. However, the option 2 is the better split for someone who wants to optimize their workout since it will allow the muscle to relax a bit before you pound it with another exercise after your first one. The issue, however with the option 2 is that you will not get a big pump, but as long as the volume remains the same, it won't matter. 

This is because you are not eating in a sustained calorie deficit. It's the only thing you need to lose weight. Calorie in vs Calorie out. This means you can eat fried chicken at your local KFC every day and still lose weight. That is of course if you are in a calorie deficit. Of course, this is not a healthy approach to losing weight since you'll not fill the nutritional needs your body has in regards to the macro and micro-nutrients. 

That's pretty much the reason for the asymmetry in your body. In fact, most people have these kinds of issues when they train. Simply because our dominant hand tries to compensate for the weaker hand. You can fix this by balancing the amount of work according to how much the difference there is between your muscles. For e.g., in the bench press, use dumbbells instead of barbells and end your session with a few sets (1-2) with your weaker side. Repeat this until you feel symmetry in your body. 

As I mentioned above, the best approach for you is to sustain a calorie deficit in your diet for a prolonged period to see any substantial results. Track your calories for a few weeks. Use a calorie tracking app called MyFitnessPal which is available in the Play Store and iTunes. Also, you don't need to track calories all your life. Do it for a few weeks and then you can just eyeball the quantities of food you need. In terms of visuals, you won't see much change in your body in just a few weeks. Also, if you want to prolong your healthy lifestyle, don't obsess over the food. Once in a while, you should eat something that is considered traditionally 'unhealthy'. Take pictures, and track your body weight. If you are extremely serious, you should ideally also track the inches in your waist and whatever body part you are most conscious about. 

You haven't mentioned how long have you been doing your endurance running, though. Weight loss is a long-term process. Depending on how extra body fat you have, it might take a long long time for you to reach your goal weight. Any sort of physical exercise is not necessary for the weight loss. Again, it's calorie in vs calorie out. However, if you lie in your bed or simply sit on a chair for the whole day, your BMR will be very low. You don't want that. This is because, with low BMR, your calorie needs per day will also be low. Eating less food will make keep you hungry for a longer time. 

(only a rough estimate, just to give you an idea). This is not considering that other foods contain proteins, too. EDIT: 2 g per kg bodyweight seems to be too much. See this article. 

They are comparable only to a certain extent anyway, and you can't equate 14 kg dumbbell curls to 28 kg barbell curls. Assuming you mean performing the exercise asymetrically (one arm at a time) vs. symetrically (both arms at the same time), I would not use the total weight, but the weight per arm. Anyway, this is quite subjective and I don't think that there is the "correct" way of doing this, this is rather a matter of taste. The correct way of doing it is the one that works for you. Anyway, it may be advisable to stick with a scheme, because you are likely to get confused if you don't. 

Reduce your rep count. As a ballpark up to six reps per set is rather strength regimen, above is hypertrophy (size). Above 12 you are rather in endurance range, but I'd guess, that there is still some extent of hypertrophy. Furthermore you'll need a considerate amount of protein to grow, think 1-2 g per kg bodyweight per day, which would be at least 90 g protein for you. Gaining heavily will be virtually impossible if you stay well below that, which should not be that hard if you don't eat much meat. 

Yes and no. Doing weight lifting will set the stimulus your body needs to grow (gain muscle mass), but lifting alone will be of no use. Imagine that your caloric intake was 1000 kcal per day (extreme value, just to make the point) while lifting. If your caloric intake would not suffice to supply you basic functionality (movements, keeping temperature, etc.), how should you gain any mass? How many calories should I eat then? While I think that in former times way larger values have been promoted, state-of-the-art seems to be a caloric surplus of around 500 kcal on training days (depending on the source in the 300-600 kcal range). Getting your macros right Another important factor is the macros. If you are mostly eating fats and (especially) carbs/sugars you will have a hard time gaining muscle mass (you will most likely gain fat if you are on a surplus). You'll have to intake protein to a certain extent. There is much ado about the exact ratios of protein/fats/carbs and I will not make a recommendation here, but it won't be too hard to find ballpark figures online. Anyway, make sure to avoid unprocessed foods as far as possible. Don't be too dogmatic, but processed foods are (often) packed with minor quality nutrients that might be detrimental to your progress. Strength ≠ Mass I've talked about how to gain mass. Now let's see how to avoid it. First thing to note is that strength and muscles are not the same. You can get way stronger without bulking. The effect of the reps Besides what you eat, another important factor is the number of repetitions per set. To gain strength without gaining mass, you should stick to a lower rep count. Strength regimen is (depending on the exercise) around 4 to 6 repetitions, while classic mass regimen is around 8 to 12 repetitions. 

The person eating fast food will mostly gain fat, not muscles and therefor maybe look bigger, but this is not due to more muscles. Having said that, eating healthy and gaining are not mutual exclusive, but you have to consider the following 

The YAYOG app lets you define your custom workouts. They have multiple exercise types, including Tabatas, which are HIIT intervals with 20 s load and 10 s rest. You could - for example - create a Tabata workout with 10 rounds (3 min) of push ups and 10 rounds of squats. 

TL/DR: Fast food should not be considered for bulking, there are better alternatives. You have an issue with the categories you are thinking in. It's not only healthy vegetables vs. unhealthy fast-food. First of all I'd doubt that fast-food will have any beneficial effect on the body. Of course, when working out, it's possible to gain some muscles when eating fast-food, but this is not because, but despite the fast food.
