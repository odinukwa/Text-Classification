Sometimes you have to play hardball with people. You have tried getting him in involved from the beginning and he didn't have any input but has done nothing but complain and not use the systems since. This has clearly gone on for weeks since yo said that was how long ti took others to get up to speed. Insubordinate actions have consequences, he needs to realize that. The new system decisions have been made, he is either on board or he is gone. I would go to a private space with him and tell him that the new system is in place, the time for complaining about it is past and he will either use it from now on or you will be discussing the issue with his line boss. I would make it clear that failure to use the system from now on would mean he would either have the task assigned to someone else with a note in his personnel folder about his failure to cooperate or he would be put on a Performance improvement plan with possible firing if transferring the task to someone else is not possible. If he doesn't start using it then, I would immediately go to his line boss and insist that he be formally reprimanded for insubordination. 

What you should do is escalate before the issue is fixed when they are reacting too slowly. However when you do a negative report after, then when the manager says to you "Hey what's the problem, the issues is fixed" then you should remind him that you are not asked to give feedback before the issue is completed and that the escalation was automatic from the system. Then you tell him you want to see it fixed for the next person who has a problem and describe what things you think he needs to fix as their manager. You are providing feedback to help the system get better and he is telling you it doesn't need to be better. You need to explain to him that yes this one individual problem is fixed, but I have these issues every single time I deal with your employees. Frankly, it often helps to involve a senior manager in fixing this sort of problem. People will ignore worker level people who complain and then take action when a senior person complains. 

It is preferable if the employee or a relative can come in and take away his personal stuff if he is going to be off for a long period of time. Unfortunately due to the nature of this type of leave, it is not always possible. There certainly should be no expectation that the desk will not be turned over to a different person (such as a temp replacement) or even that the office will still be in the same location when this person returns. When you are out for an extended period, the company may need to use the space. We had one person who was out for six months for an illness whose possessions got moved 6 separate times in that time period as we hired many new people and tried to find the space to put them in. The critical thing is that the supervisor take care to make sure the personal possessions are not lost. But remember, this is not an employee's desk, it is a company desk. The company can do what it like with it. The person's computer may also get reassigned as it too is company property. After all if I hire a temp to do your job while you are out on six months of leave, I am not likely to buy a new computer for that person. This is one reason why it is almost never a good idea to store much personal stuff on your work computer. People get attached to their space. But remember, you don't own the desk, you don't own the computer, so don't leave anything there that you would not want others to see or that it would pain you to lose. Most companies will try hard not to lose your physical stuff if they need to take the space for someone else, but if the time period is long enough, it is easy to lose stuff. 

Since you are a new manager, this is how I would proceed. First I would determine for myself if the music is too loud and/or if the other person talks loudly. You need to know if one or both or neither complaints are valid. Go spend some time casually in their work space and make note of how it seems to be to you Don't be obviously looking at this. Go by for other reasons, but pay attention when you are there. Further, observe how these people work with each other. There is a strong likelihood that neither the loud talking or the radio is the real issue. These kinds of things tend to come up when two people don't like or respect each other. So watch their interactions for a couple of days. Next evaluate which of the two people is your better employee. It is likely that you may have to take an action that makes one of these two unhappy; know in advance which person is the one you most want to support especially if the both complaints have some validity. This does not mean the better employee gets a free pass on his behavior if he is in the wrong. It is one factor of many that you can consider. It really only comes into play when someone is significantly better, the job is critical, and especially if the position is hard to fill at that level of performance. Next discuss the whole issue with HR. As a new manager, you may not be used to consulting with HR about personnel issues. However, they can help you a good bit in knowing what the options are and what process you need to follow. Don't start out telling them the actual issue and people involved. First talk to them abuot what the copmany policies for conflict resolution are. Once you know how much freedom you have to decide what happens, then you have a better idea of what you can do. I am suspecting you will find that both people are contributing to the problem. You will have to watch whatever solution you have to make sure these two don't escalate into new issues espcially if one person feels he has won over the other. Of the options avaiable, if it is possible to move these people so they don't interfere with each other, that is probably the best move. It is the least likely to generate further complaints. Neither person will feel as if he is the winner as long as one does not end up with a significantly better location than the other. It will seem the most fair solution to most people. But it may not be possible. I don't know how closely these two people need to work. Or if they both need to work with the same equipment. If you have to come down on one side or the other, consider other people who work in the same area. When I worked in an office where the radio was played, majority ruled on whether it was played and what station it was on. Taking this route makes it a group decsion. Of course this doesn't help if the group consists of only these two people. Whichever side you come down is bound to make someone unhappy. Consider in your solution if you can find some other thing to give the person who loses this discussion as a sweetener and to show that you are not just favoring one person. 

There are plenty of sample tests available on the Internet. Get the ones for Java and practice until you can nail them. Every time you don't pass a sample test, figure out what you did wrong. Then figure out what you should have done instead. Then take the test again. More importantly, learn to retain that information so that the next time you are faced with a similar test, you can do it. 

If he is drinking at work, the probability of errors in his work is substantially increased. The more you drink, the more logical processing ability you lose. I have worked with alcoholics and in every case, there was a measurable decrease in the quality of the work (In this case, it may well be why he is on a performance improvement plan). When I worked as an analyst, I could even see the exact place in the calculations where the person moved from not drunk to drunk when doing QC checks. If it seriously affects someone's ability to do simple addition and multiplication (this was back in the olden days before PCs when all math calulations were done manually), how much more do you think it is going to affect something more complex like programming? In every case I have been witness to, a person found to be drinking at work got fired. I have even seen government employees (who are notoriously difficult to get fired) be fired for this. So if you report it and the investigation bears out your complaint, likely the guy will get fired. You have to judge for yourself if this is a good or bad thing or something that you can live with yourself for being partially a cause of (well he is mostly the cause of this, but it still feels like you caused it if it happens). It also can have a negative effect on your relationships with other employees if it becomes known that you did this. If you don't want to report it, at least be aware that you need to check over any code he has written pretty carefully when you have reason to touch it or to code review it. Also rather than report his drinking, you can bring up any code quality issues you find. Particularly if they are seriously impacting the project getting done. This is something that is provable unlike, "I think I smelled alcohol on his breath."
