I think (and I broadly agree here with Eckart Förster, whose book The Twenty-Five Years of Philosophy will be quoted here for reference) that Hegel roughly follows Kant's understanding of science. Therefore, clarifying what Kant wrote about science may help to elucidate how this intertwines with the idea of a single principle. Kant himself on science Kant thought that science is, as opposed to a modern understanding, a set of constructible, certain sentences. Certain, however, they can only be if the way they are obtained itself is certain, which for him means by and from principles that are themselves certain. Förster draws on these two main aspects: 

But how influential was he?! Well, this may, as always, be subject to discussions. But the Dutch researchers write: 

As the Oxford Handbooks are always a good start, I would go with it. Aside: Kant on this distinction Kant introduces a clear distinction (as also stated by Virmaior) in his Metaphysics of Morals: 

The source for his last sentence here is "Joseph Needham, Science and Civilisation in China, 4 vols. (Cambridge: Cambride University Press, 1956), II, 497" The great influence Confucius had in Leibniz' times is noted by Hegel in his lectures on the history of philosophy: 

Kant goes through our three faculties of knowledge (Sensuousness, Understanding, Reason) in the Transcendental Aesthetics, Analytics and Dialectics. In every faculty he is searching for perceptions a priori and their relation to objects. So space and time are a priori knowledge from our Sensuousness (its form !), the categories from our Understanding. The transcendental ideas are the perceptions a priori from Reason, but they are problematic because of their lack of an object in experience, although able to be thought without contradiction (definition A254|B310). Space, time and the categories have objects in experience (i.e. every sensual intuition) and are therefore knowledge. A priori concepts they are in the same sense as they are necessary conditions of our relationality to objects (question from his letter to Herz from 1773). They are not thought "before" any experience in a sense of time, but in a sense of inference. Regarding the relation between space and time on the one hand and the categories on the other hand there is another aspect already established in his dissertation and repeated in the Transcendental Deduction: Time and space as forms of intuition are used for the conclusion that sensual intuitions are mere appearances. What is new in CPR is that Categories as the most abstract concepts of our relation to sensual objects (which for us is only possible in form of intuitions!) can only be applied to intuitions, therefore are underlying the form of space and time, too. I suggest reading Eckart Förster's The 25 Years of Philosophy for a quite good presentation of the overarching argument. 

TL;DR Kant's answer is that if it helps you, you may use all versions as they are objectively the same. But strictly speaking, there is only one single categorical imperative and applying this is always the "best" (most rational) way to judge morality. 

The truthfulness of early translations Again referring to the Dutch paper, it obviously was not that much of Confucius in these translations: 

He clarifies this point later and I wholeheartedly agree with him, adding the Anthropology to the list: 

=> This also corresponds with the strong kantian tradition in Germany, because the human dignity as inviolable, absolute value is a kantian concept first expressed in his Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals (1785), Ak. 435. The very first formulation of dignity in this sense is by Samuel von Pufendorf more than 100 years earlier in De iure naturae et gentium libri octo (1672) as a reaction to Hobbes' Leviathan, so that v. Pufendorf can be considered the ancestor of dignity and public international law [Völkerrecht] in the modern sense. Regarding the ethical principles and consequences So the philosophical point behind this reasoning (and the three probably most influential formulations of human rights of the last 70 years) is that while other fundamental/human/basic rights (whatever they are called) can be relativised, the one that constitutes humanity as such, human dignity, must not. And this is in the end a thought that emerged in the era of Enlightenment, embodied by kantian moral philosophy. Yes, there may be consequences that some individuals hold to be unintentional and undiserable. It will have negative consequences for the welfare of individuals that seem injust. But this is the framework of values we have given ourselves and made them constitutional for our society exactly because it is thought (with Kant) to be the best for human society as a whole. In fact, injustice will be done either way, because the causing acts are injust. This is why we need law (this is the standard thought e.g. of Kant, Fichte and Hegel in their philosophy of law). Books on that topic Regarding Kant's own reasons for and conceptions of human dignity: Sensen, Oliver: Kant on Human Dignity Regarding the kantian understanding of human rights and the relations between these frameworks: Follesdal, Andreas and Maliks, Reidar (eds.): Kantian Theory and Human Rights Appendix regarding the German constitution in particular The only way to change this in Germany is making a new constitution, because article 1 and 20 cannot be changed and are eternal as long as this constitution is in effect (Article 79, sentence 3 Grundgesetz). This includes the human dignity as highest, absolute (i.e. not to be relativised) value (article 1) and the main rules for the government: Federal structure, rule of law, democracy, representative government, sociality and the right to resist against anyone who actively tries to change any of these (article 20). Perhaps you can now conceive how important it was for the men that formulated the Grundgesetz not to open dignity for ethical calculus, especially after the cruelties and terror of WWII that showed how important the absoluteness of dignity is. If you are interested to learn more about the structure and values of the German Grundgesetz (basically, the first 17 articles represent the valuation of basic rights according to their order), there is an official translation available (also in PDF) here. 

Grundsein consist of "Grund" = ground, basis, foundation,cause, reason and "sein" = being. I hold "reason" to be the best translation, as it seems to point at a relation of inference and not a material connection. Now, as we are speaking about ontology and a criticism of German Idealism (and neo-kantianism in particular), I think that what I translated as "nonentity" can be held to mean "negativity". "Nichts" is nothing else than the absence of everything, pure negativity. So if we have a reason to state something that we can only define negativly, do we really have reason to state anything meaningful? I think Heidegger here insists that we do not. This is supported by the fact that "Nichtigkeit" in a literal common meaning could be described as "something that has no importance whatsoever" with a prejorative connotation. I do not know about the native connotations of "nothingness", so I do not know if the first approximation is a good one here. Having said this, a second step could be a reformulation:
