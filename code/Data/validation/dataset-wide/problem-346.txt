From the way the question is worded, I assume the upper city was built first, with the lower city retrofitted beneath. The first priority in structural engineering is to transfer loads downward. The upper city is built on something, typically a layer of bedrock, so you have to preserve that support while you dig the space and install the load-bearing members. The deeper you go, the more weight you add to the total, because those members also support their own weight. More plausible might be a dome over your lower city. A dome distributes weight to the edges while leaving the center open. Several small domes would be even better. On the other hand, you could have one tall parabolic opening. Once you build this city, though, you run into infrastructure concerns. Where do you get food, water, fresh air, power, light? What do you do with garbage, sewage, smoke? How do you travel to and from the surface? What are the psychological effects of living in a hole? A more plausible scenario might be to build the lower city upside down and share infrastructure with the upper city. 

Since you asked for a reality check... this is not possible. We currently have civilian small arms that can put a round through steel plates and concrete blocks. (To say nothing of military small arms that are classified as anti-materiel weapons, which are designed for use and against, and are effective against "light" armored vehicles.) You are simply not going to be able to create a light fabric that can sustain an impact with that much kinetic energy. And even if you could, you'd just succeed in changing what type of projectiles are fired from guns. Currently, firearms generally rely on propelling a blunt projectile at high speeds to apply crushing force trauma to their intended target. Kevlar and similar materials are good at dissipating and defeating this type of force, but even so they have their limits - most armor piercing rounds work on the same fundamental principle (high speed crushing force trauma), just using harder materials and higher velocities. Of particular importance, though, is that these materials only hold up well against crushing force impacts, not, for example, sharp force impacts. You want to kill someone through a Kevlar vest, you can do that easily with a bow and arrow, for example. So even if you manage to somehow create a fabric that blocks all crushing force trauma, rendering current bullet designs ineffective, you have the problem of dealing with sharp-force trauma. It would not be difficult to design projectiles to be razor-sharp at the tips, which would shred your fabric. More problematic is that simple crushing force or sharp force impact is hardly the end of the line for projectile weapons. We have incendiary rounds and explosive rounds for various small arms, and even have specialized small arms that can deliver chemical agents into a target. (Not firearms in the traditional sense, but there's no reason we couldn't do that, if some miracle fabric arrived on the scene that made it beneficial to put a chemical payload into a bullet.) So bottom line, you can't do what you're proposing, realistically, and even if you could, you'd just succeed in changing what type of bullets are fired from guns. Ranged combat is just too much of advantage to give up. (There's even a theory that we humans owe our status as apex predators to our preference for ranged weaponry - other predators risk injury and death when engaging prey in melee combat, but our use of ranged weapons has largely eliminated that risk, at least as it relates to the food chain, so that behavior is so vastly beneficial, it's just not going to change.) 

One possible solution is to control the technology that contains the beasts. Since the container is keyed to the owner's DNA, it provides a way to limit, or at least trace, how the beast is used. Add a transmitter and a verification system to the container, so that the user has to state a reason for releasing the beast (something like a flight plan for an aircraft). Or add a cross-check mechanism so that the container can only be opened inside certain facilities, where there are barriers to keep the beasts in check. Somewhere inside the facility is a device, like the chip in a credit card, so that both must be present for the system to work. The cross-check operates on a specific radio frequency, so unauthorized use can be quickly detected. The other side of the coin is the beast's DNA. Whatever triggers a beast's metamorphosis to a stronger form, it must be inhibited until the owner has the training and license to control that new form. If the owner can't or won't follow the regulations, the upgrade doesn't happen. Put off too long, the upgrade may produce feedback in the beast's metabolism and destroy it, which is exactly the result you want for an unlicensed engine of destruction. 

No, it can't. The two are completely separate things. One, the industrial revolution, was focused on mass production of goods by unskilled laborers, which displaced the previous "cottage industries" and skilled workers who produced the same goods at smaller scales. This really has no direct connection to sanitation. Furthermore, we have at least one very famous counter-point to this idea - the Roman empire. They had public baths, plumbing, running water and were very hygienic compared to Europeans even a thousand years later. Yet, we know the industrial revolution happened in Europe over a thousand years after the fall of the Roman empire. 

I'm pretty sure Hollywood style voodoo dolls can't be destroyed without inflicting damage on the target, and since you're unable to have the creator unmake it, I don't see a safe way to destroy it, unless you want to expend a lot of time and energy learning enough voodoo to magically unenchant it yourself. If that's not an option, the best approach is to give the voodoo doll to the target, and make its safekeeping their problem. "Let's bury the hatchet... by the way, you probably want to keep this someplace safe, and not accidentally light it on fire, or anything like that." 

Magic is all about patterns. You chant a spell, you wave a wand, you throw eye of newt, and poof! You have to do all three things together, one or two won't work. The magician is looking for correspondences. "As above, so below" was the basis of astrology, but it led to astronomy. Alchemy was magic, but it led to chemistry. According to our science, then, magic is looking in the right places but asking the wrong questions. In your world, however, magic works. The magician understands that patterns have power, even if there's no logical explanation. The scientist understands that, if it works, there's logic in there somewhere, it's just that nobody's found it yet. The scientist can analyze the spell, the wand, and the eye but not understand the gestalt that happens by combining them. By seeing it work, though, you can work backwards from what you do understand. To put it another way, lightning is like magic. It happens, we see it, but until recently we didn't know what it was or why it happened. With science you can ask the right questions, play around with things, and discover how to generate your own lightning in a bottle. We might not have electricity without the idea of lightning to guide us. Science is supremely rational. Magic is supremely irrational. They have to work in the same universe. They operate on the same fundamental forces, so they have common ground somewhere, they're just coming at it from different directions. Perhaps there is something like quantum physics, a more sophisticated model of the universe, that would make sense to both sides once they worked it out. 

It probably depends. It might be possible for some types of fusion reactors, but you're really focusing on the wrong problem. Getting tritium or deuterium or whatever fusion fuel you have hot enough to initiate fusion is not hard. Sustaining the reaction and extracting energy from it is the hard part. As observed in other answers, and basically the same question on the Physics Stack, the limitation of a lens is that it cannot heat anything beyond the temperature of the body it's focusing light from, and the surface of a star is not hot enough for a sustained fusion reaction. Having said that, one type of fusion we humans have explored (and are still exploring, to my knowledge) is called inertial confinement fusion, and basically uses lasers to generate shockwaves in a fuel pellet, compressing and heating it enough to generate a (brief) fusion reaction. 

He wasn't talking about storing information on all the atoms in a human body, but it sure looks to me like it applies here as well. 

Small, impossible to reproduce, irrefutable proof of identity? You want a crystal ball (or similar artifact) through which the Goddess can communicate. It seems magical, but only in the Clarke's Third Law sense, i.e. sufficiently advanced technology. A specific phrase activates the item, for example, "We beseech thee, O Goddess, share with us thy wisdom." The Big Bad doesn't know about the item, otherwise he'd take steps to get it or block the connection. On the other hand, he may know, and the bearer is in great (greater?) danger. It's a mental connection, so the Big Bad doesn't notice when She's "talking" through it--or She has implanted electronic gear so that She can subvocally speak and hear. The Goddess can answer questions, give orders, and preach to Her followers. Nobody could fake that, not at that technology level, and nobody could mistake that it came from anyone else. An alternate version might contain an AI that reacts the way She would. 

Deep in the Valley of Silicon, the slumbering being known as Yog-Sothoth twitched. Tendrils of eldritch messages flung themselves along channels prepared in ancient times. The stars had made their sigil in the heavens and foretold the reappearance of another Old One. Yog-Sothoth sent segments of itself to conjure arcane applets of foul code from terminals that glowed dimly in the recesses of Intel HQ. Those monstrous routines writhed across the world, using shadowy protocols unknown to mortals and flinging our insignificant data into the outer darkness. Everywhere the dedicated sysadmins of humanity labored, their processors flickered with an abominable purple nimbus, and their once-placid visages became fiendish masks of hellish glee. A Cyclopean miasma of energy formed around the Facebook building in Seattle. Cthulhu pushed against the barrier, but it held. It held! 

To be a bit pedantic, the simplest thought I can come up with is the number 1. It takes a single bit to store that thought, so there's your answer - one bit. Anything beyond that, though, and you bump into how fundamentally unanswerable this question is. It's like asking how long a book is. Well, it entirely depends on the book. The world's longest book contains almost 2 million words long, and the shortest books in the world literally contain no text (if you don't like that, you can find any number of children's books that contain dozens of words). So it is with thoughts. It's possible to conceive of a thought that takes only a single bit to store, and it's possible to conceive of a rambling stream of consciousness that would require vast arrays of storage media to completely record. 

This is actually a solved problem. As most of the other answers have pointed out, you can't really make a phone untraceable, as it needs to uniquely identify itself to connect to the network(s) that make it usable. It is possible to spoof or clone the unique identifiers on the phone, but the standard solution to this problem is to make it so that the phone can't be linked to the person using it. For most people, this means "burner phones". Cheap, disposable pay-as-you go phones bought with cash and thrown away after a short period of use. With the resources available to wealthy CEO, rather than buying cheap flip phones to use as burners, you'd be able to buy smartphones with security-centric OSes, but the principle is the same. You can't make the phone untraceable, so you prevent it being attributed to the person using it, who is really the target of the tracking in the first place. 

One simple answer is to make your bullets from ice. Keep them in a cooler until ready to use. If they hit something hard, they shatter. As long as the temperature is above freezing, they'll melt. Best of all, even if one is recovered, there's no way to trace it. 

The reason for heads is to give the eyes a swiveling perch at the top. If you put the eyes on stalks, you could get away with putting nose, mouth, etc., in the torso. If the setting is a "new world" of some kind, you might include an assortment of other creatures with the same configuration, to explain how they evolved. 

One model to follow might be the American Indian. They had a very stable society, developed over centuries. They didn't have high technology, but they didn't need it. Your society will start out with more toys. They see the benefit of proceeding with caution. They understand, better than those in our world, that greed is the root of all evil. They understand the need to put common goals ahead of individual goals. Yes, they will progress more slowly, not because they have fewer resources but because they choose to weigh their options carefully, stay in harmony with nature, maintain a sustainable economy, progress ethically, and avoid rapid shifts in infrastructure and supplies. Their communities will be smaller but more numerous. Their politics will tend towards preventing problems rather than exacerbating them. They will revere the elderly for their wisdom. They will treasure the things they have rather than covet the things they don't. Sounds boring, though, from a writer's point of view. Where's the conflict? Who are the villains? One answer is in your question. Someone decides pumping oil out of the ground is a great idea. It's gooey, it's explosive, it's poisonous, but it's a easy source of power. There's your conflict. Someone wants power, and they're willing to upset the established order to get it. The best way to solve an addiction to petroleum is to never get hooked in the first place. 

I would go with "electric wind", which is what's currently being cited as the cause of Venus's desiccation. In essence, strongly charged electrical wind in the upper atmosphere performed an electrolytic separation of atmospheric water, and drove the ionized oxygen and hydrogen off into space. On Earth, you could imagine this process interrupting the hydrological cycle, preventing or drastically curtailing rainfall. It's not realistic to truly desiccate a planet on non-geological time scales, but if you prevent rain from falling, you'd effectively kill off any land-based plant life. If you wanted, you could say it was kicked off by a massive solar storm (CME) hitting Earth and charging the atmosphere, which you could also use for your bonus objective of burning those in direct sunlight - this one had enough UV radiation to decimate the ozone layer, and the electric wind phenomenon that it started keeps new ozone from forming in the upper atmosphere, so now people get sunburns and eventually develop skin cancers from prolonged epxosure to direct sunlight. CMEs are not actually deadly to people as you seem to think, based on the comment in your question, and we have historical records of being hit by some pretty big ones, most notably in 1859. People did fine, electrical equipment, however, did not. 

Can we agree, as SF writers, to stop extrapolating this way? What possible reason is there to think that, during the centuries we develop FTL cruise ships, we won't make a single breakthrough in computer technology? Unless your ships run on diesel engines, your computers shouldn't use today's ideas either. We already have some of the equipment and techniques we need to make quantum computers. Do some research. Design a computer that fits into your setting. If it's necessary to your plot for a stasis pod to fail, find a convincing way to make it fail in context. Somebody sabotaged it. An employee at the factory got fired while assembling it and "lost" a wrench. One of the kids pressed a few buttons and accidentally started the self-destruct sequence. During the ejection process, one corner nicked a loose girder, so the stasis field didn't enclose the pod completely. A reader who doesn't understand how computers work won't understand how a CPU overload affects an escape capsule.
