The cogito 'I think therefore I am', is when you think about it, not quite what it means. Consider a fox, one rather suspects that it has some inner consciousness that it is, and this without enunciating to itself the cogito (what is the private language of a fox, for it assuredly has not a public one, at least one not reducible to a language of signs and gestures, which in its width is no longer a language in the usual sense; and Wittgenstein assures us that there can be no private language with a public counterpart). In this direction, one can reduce this statement to 'I am'; or just 'am'. So, what then, Descartes cogito? It has the form of an axiom, a la Euclid; but the similarity is spurious as the ambit of Euclid - plane geometry - is tightly controlled, with specific and formal rules of organisation. One should see it as an 'inspiration'; and thus it is neither an axiom, in the mathematical sense, and thus nor a proof. In mathematics one does not prove obvious things; if one does it is usually in terms of a larger project. For example, the natural numbers were axiomatised only in the early twentieth century. Given that plane geometry was axiomatised, why then the long wait to axiomatise the natural numbers? This is simply because they were seen as obvious (hence natural); and therefore not in need of any kind of formal machinery - that it was done was due to the emergence of a larger programme - to reduce mathematics to logic; hence the neccessity to find a formalisation that would fit into this framework. Descartes axiomatic way of considering philosophy inspired Spinozas 'geometrisation' of neo-Platonism, and Wittgensteins 'logical' method of reducing facts (statements about the world) to propositions (logical statements) and also Leibniz Monadology which applied the same systematic approach to a synthesis of Greek philosophy (atoms and substance) to Christian theology. What this then brings us to is a consciousness of what it means to prove; and this should, as it does, mean to convince someone who is aware of the larger aims of that area of knowledge; hence one finds differing kinds of arguments in differing domains of knowledge that are taken as valid. To put this in context, one often hears that in principle one can prove the notions in physics - for example that fibre bundles naturally interpret physical theories in a geometric manner. This is a platitude, as it would take on average six years of serious study to be able to do this. It is not as simple as showing that 1 and 1 is 2, which is a monents work; and because it's a moments work is probably not seen as worthwhile; that it is is due to the presence of a tradition. Proof in mathematics, in one sense, means that someone can prove it, and usually not yourself; that we are convinced by these proofs is more often than not due to other factors: the presence of tradition, and therefore of authority; it's utility, and therefore the presence of practical knowledge. It's after these factors that has driven the mass education of mathematical thinking. Still, there are a few, and they are usually only a few, who do appreciate mathematics as a subject, for what it is. All this doesn't answer your question 'what are the fundamental truths of philosophy'; and this because it is too wide and too broad to admit any easy answer, or even a difficult and long one; which doesn't mean that it isn't an important one. One might say the fundamental truth of philosophy is the verb in Descartes axiom: to think. 

Parmenides wrote in his poem, that he was brought before a goddess at the gates of Night and Day, in the abode of the Sun; and by steeds and chariot; and she told him there: 

What is the simplest modification of this scheme when introducing quantifiers? ie All(∀) and Exists(∃)? The SEP suggests that for SQML that one introduces the axiom: 

Aristotle, who wrote a book which was later called metaphysics; and which then meant after the Physics, another book of his; said that this discipline explores the first principles of things. Physics in his sense is wider than the notion we have today; and its important that that this study comes after and not before; being more difficult, more abstract and much more uncertain; and this comes through in his discussion of the positions of different philosophers, as well as his own commentary on them. Hume, who is often seen as the most severe of sceptics, defends in an Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding, the more difficult and profound study - Metaphysics against the friends of the 'easy philosophy' who are apt to pour scorn on it. Easy here, isn't a pejorative label - in fact Hume says the easy philosophy enjoys its fame for good reason; and nor should it be seen as easy, it too can be difficult in a different way. 

The 'Copernican principle' wasn't a means by which Modern Science was constructed; if one takes account of its entire history; it's a summation of some general principles that have been discovered; there's a speculative character to Physics which isn't generally noted - though it should - when one gets beyond what can be directly tested for; the main metaphysical principle is Occams Razor in one of its many forms: here, physical laws that are known now are pushed back (Smolin for example suggested that it might be useful to explore if laws change in the distant past; though of course one can ask whether the laws that underlie this are immutable; but that would be a philosophic metaphysic; whereas Smolins is an actual move in the edifice of physics). But the point of Big-Bang cosmology is that proceeds on a long-established science, much longer than physics itself: astronomy; I hadn't realised just how relatively recently it became consensual. Interestingly, The Belgian priest Lemaitre who theorised it called it the 'primeval atom'; which is another sense of atom; it also, interestingly, tracks Hegels 'History of Philosophy'; where he drew out the phenomenal Democritean atoms from the immutable Parmenidian atom; according to this article - he was also interested in the philosophic issues it raised - which were many; but unfortunately it doesn't go into it. 

It's by reaching out to reality that Wittgenstein establishes the truth and falsity of propositions; recall analytic propositions are true by virtue of their form; and then note TLP 2.224 which has 

Is Nagarjuna by affirming the Sunyata of being, that is nothingness, commenting on the lack of object essences, that this sofa that I'm sitting on has no essence in and of itself; thus it's being is interdependent on other beings. (I shouldn't use the word being here at all, but I cannot think of the appropriate terminology - it cetainly isn't svabhava). That is if being is interdependent it makes no sense to to talk of the essence of a part of it one must talk of the essence of all of it. That is only the whole of being, or being qua being, has svabhava. But then the whole of being thus becomes an object to us, and if we follow his dictum, it must also have no essence. But we have argued that it must have an essence. Does this mean, if we are not prepared to entertain contradiction, that the whole of being is not an object to us? 

If it was painful or destructive, in a proper sense, then it would be a species of Horror; and this would jar against the good humour of comedy. That which provokes our pity (one could say here, the pitiful; but one shouldn't because its sense is no longer consonant with that which provokes pity; but like the word pathetic, which was originally meant that which had pathos; now both are close to meaning that which deserves our contempt; this movement in emotional value is of significance itself; but I digress) according to Aristotle, is the emotion proper to tragedy; hence he says: 

Marx was a theorist of Capitalism which he considered the dominant form of economic activity on this era; to be distinguished from earlier ones - such as the mercantile city states and feudalism; or much earlier systems of barter say; as Rosa Luxembourg explained he was focused on formulating the economic laws of motion of Capitalism; and this needs to be distinguished from his work as a critic of capitalism which in a way many people were in mitigating the brutalities of a new system of economic production that hadn't been domesticated yet: the latter part of the first volume of Das Kapital displays his dismay to the 'bare life' (vita laborans or vita zoe) that some working men were reduced to - this part of the book is a kind of study in what today might be called social anthropology. As Marx was after a scientific explanation of economics he couldn't allow his personal sympathies distort his thinking on the subject; the force of gravity operates no matter how I may feel about plane crashes. Communism in one way of thinking is the economic order that comes after Capitalism; in another way of thinking its a specific political programme to force this change; and in another it describes regimes that were named as such as a bloc against the West during the long Cold War. 

Rouse Ball is indulging in analogical thinking: First potential, which is literally not sensible, ie I can't sense it; for example I cannot see or feel gravitational potential. This becomes real when it becomes kinetic which is sensible: I can feel the force of a stone thrown at me, or I can see it moving. Thus potential activates itself in the world by moving a stone. This represents the scientific analogy or correspondance to Kants a priori forms of cognition (which include time, space, number); they themselves aren't sensible to us - I cannot see time, or space or number; they become real when synthesised with sensory intuition: I see things move, ie the hand of a clock or a car move; thus inferring time; I walk in space or kick a ball in about; thus experiencing space; I pick up one or two bottles. This sensory input; or intuition in Kants phrasing is essential to grounding the mind; thus this is why sensory deprivation is either disorientating (in controlled experiments) or induces states of mind not dis-similar to psychosis (in long-term solitary confinement say in prisons). 

They can't remain at rest in the unknown; they make a thing out of the unknown and worship it. Actually, here N uses the term 'unintelligible' - which has a specific meaning: it cannot, due to its own nature, be understood by the human intelligence, or perhaps any kind of intelligence - which should be distinguished from the mere unknown, which is a question of knowledge: it is unknown, it may become more known; and then, perhaps, completely known. In contemporary accounts this might be called a form of mysticism; of which there are differing accounts: genuine mystics, such as Al-Ghazali or Meister Eckhart, say; or new-age, ersatz mysticism - a kind of pastiche. So - it seems here, he is against mystics; more subtlety, he may be against various forms of negative theology. 

Rawls, A theory of justice, provides a Kantian inspired piece of reasoning for such an axiom. This is his 'veil of ignorance'. Say before you were born, a god asked you what would you wish as the law of the world that you were to be into, given that you do not know to whom you will be born, and nor your social position. Rawls argues under such a presupposition, one should argue that the law should treat everyone equally.
