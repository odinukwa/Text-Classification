MR is the marginal revenue. The best way to calculate most variables in economics, which has the word "marginal" in it is to take the derivative of the part of the word besides "marginal". In this case you need to take the derivative of revenue with respect to quantity. For marginal cost, in case you don't have it given like here, you would take the derivative of the cost function with respect to quantity. In your problem you first you need to find the revenue. Revenue is quantity times price, so in your case $R= 60Q - 2Q^2 $. The derivative of that is $R' = 60 - 4Q = MR$. Setting $MR=MC$ will give you the solution for Q (the optimal quantity. Inserting that solution for Q into the price equation, which is here $P=60 - 2Q$ will give you the optimal price. 

Cobb-Douglas: $X=(\alpha/(α+β)) M/2p$ Perfect compliments (min): $X=αm/(βp1 + αp2)$ Perfect Substitutes: $X=M/p$; where X is demand for some good, M is the budget, p the price(of good 1 or 2) and α and β are just utility parameters. 

There is theoretical work on the matter in general. In fact, many standard models of optimal consumption taxation will typically yield a distortion that is increasing and convex in the rate of taxation. This means that increasing a tax on a good from 5% to 6% results in higher distortion than increasing it from 2% to 3%. Following this logic, it is better to tax many goods at a low rate than to tax few goods at a high rate, as the distortion would be smaller. This means that removing the exemptions (taxing goods with a currently lower rate of taxation than the rest) is better than increasing the tax rate on previously taxed goods (since they have a currently higher rate than the exempt goods). To conclude, it means that the distortion from taxing exempt goods, which would mean going from 0% to e.g. 20% (assumed current VAT in Australia) is lower than going from 20% (current tax rate on non-exempt goods) to 40%, or so. For a reference, see for example slide 30 (and a few before) in this slide set I found online. Its from Mankiw's Microeconomic Principles. This however does not take into account any "fairness" considerations or welfare implications for the case of households not being able to afford enough food as a result. So the standard theory may not apply in cases where taxing food at all may lead to starvation, as starvation is not considered. However this is likely not the case anyway for such a rich economy as Australia that has other means of providing welfare (incl. food) to the needy. 

If supply is perfectly elastic (horizontal supply curve), then an increase in demand does not increase the price. It's highly unlikely that supply of petrol here is perfectly elastic. This could be the case under perfect competition with constant marginal costs of petrol. However, typically petrol has increasing marginal costs. Alternatively, it could be the case with constant marginal costs and Bertrand competition (price competition, with few firms) meaning they also set prices equal to marginal costs as in perfect competition. There may be costs to increasing the price. So-called menu costs make prices sticky and therefore changes are not as often as we expect. E.g. if you're a restaurant and want to increase prices, you have to reprint all menus, which may not be worth it for a temporary demand increase. However, this is probably not tbe case in your example. When setting the price before the shortage was announced, the increase in demand was expected and the price already set accordingly high. Was there an increase in the price (shortly) before the announcement? If not then the next explanation is the only possibility. Government regulation of the price. 

You can't create something from nothing. When the government prints money, that's really just colored paper. Printed money, in case production has not increased, will make money lose value. When the government raises taxes, it is taxing goods and services, i.e. getting real ressources from people (in the form of money, yes, but real ressources nonetheless). If money were printed without real ressources behind it, it would lose value. The value of money is basically determined just like the value of anything else - supply and demand. So if you print a lot of money (supply increases) its value will go down. That's the reason the government doesn't just print a lot of money and give it to everyone, because that money would lose value, i.e. it would lead to inflation (rising prices). The "Quantity Theory of Money" tells us that the purchasing power of money is related to production, i.e. the real ressources in the economy. That's because all money must be able to buy all goods in an economy by definition. So if you have 2 pieces of bread and a dollar in the world, that dollar is worth 2 pieces of bread. Say now, you printed another dollar, but bread has stayed the same. Now each dollar is worth only 1 piece of bread. So in total, nothing has been achieved, besides making money less valuable (which translates to rising prices. Before a pies of bread cost half a dollar, now it costs 1 dollar). Furthermore, once you create inflation this way through priniting money, besides achieving nothing, it has cotst on the real economy, through for example menu-costs or shoe-leather costs. That means people need to adjust not, menus need to be printed anew for restaurants and that's costly etc. Also savers and people on fixed income lose money through inflation. Also you might send the economy into an inflationary spiral. Often high inflation leads to even more inflation, which eventually can collapse the whole economy and currency. See episodes of hyperinflation for this. 

Basically, look at all the assumptions required for the result that the market is efficient. See where those assumptions fail and voila you have found a form of market failure. Note that not all goods produce externalities as you might think. Further note that yes, very often the market fails. Hence a great amount of markets are actually regulated. For whatever business you open you'll need to register it get a permit, etc. However very often we don't need a lot of regulation. Often the debates are not about whether to have any regulation or not, but rather the necessary extent of regulation. This is because regulation is costly and we don't want to use it if the benefits to it are too small compared to its cost. 

You are correct. Trade deficits are not unfair, although it is hard to define unfair in an economic sense. No one is forced to trade and trade represents a consensual agreement. The strongest economic argument for considering trade deficits unfair is so-called dumping, which is a form of unfair competition. That is when firms sell goods abroad at below a normal price in order to drive out the local competition in the long run. As the foreign businesses would make losses doing so, it only works if the foreign governments subsidize those firms. That is why subsidies leading to unfair competition are banned according to the World Trade Organization rules. In the case of the steel tariffs imposed by the U.S., dumping by China was used as an argument, although there was no evidence of China conducting steel dumping and China isn't even one of the main exporters of steel to the U.S. Another reason is that a trade deficit means that foreign firms are doing better than domestic ones, thereby threatening the jobs of domestic workers. However, for this to happen consumers must be voluntarily buying those foreign products. if foreign firms offer a much better and/or cheaper product, then a trade deficit is great for consumers, but bad for domestic workers who produce those goods. In this case, trade still represents an overall net increase in welfare, but there are winners and losers. If the winners (consumers) would compensate the wokrers who lost their jobs, everything would be fine. If they do not it could be considered unfair, although it is not the foreign country being unfair in this case. From my experience, there may also be illogical reasons that people consider trade unfair, which I discuss below. When a country runs a trade deficit that means that it is consuming more than it produces. The country consumes at least as much as it produced and then a bit from what other countries produced too. When that happens, a country is essentially borrowing money from the rest of the world, because consuming more than you have is like spending more money than you have. That is what people mean when they say the U.S. owes a lot of money to China. In this sense many people who take out a loan with a bank to buy something think it is unfair that they have to pay it back. That could be one way in which deficits are considered unfair. Another way in which deficits are considered unfair is by comparing a country to a business, which is wrong and leads to wrong policy. A business wants to maximize profits, so it would like to sell more goodst than it buys. The business fails otherwise. In this sense, a business seeing other business succeeding where it fails might think it is being treated unfairly. As discussed, however, a trade surplus just means that you are lending money to the rest of the world. That may be good for some time, but only if you eventually get it back, i.e. eventually run a deficit. So for a business, perpetually making profits is a good thing. For a country, a perpetual surplus forever is not welfare enhancing.
