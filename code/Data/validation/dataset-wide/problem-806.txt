So does the word "sequence" in this case now mean just a particular ordering, and not a progression over time that any one star makes? Is the main sequence just some kind of plateau in stellar evolution where stars spend a significant duration? 

The moon must be within about 28.6 degrees north or south of that equatorial arc. The 28.6 figure adds the Earth's axial tilt - the famous angle between Earth's spin and orbit, 23.437 degrees - to the angle between the Moon and Earth's orbits, 5.145 degrees. So imagine a 57.2 degree band across your sky (28.6 doubled), along the celestial equator. The sun is confined to a similar 46.9 degree band. Here's a visual for this kind of segment of your celestial sphere. 

No, the Main Sequence is more like a starting line. Most stars spend a long time on one point of it (10 billion years for the sun) while they fuse hydrogen into helium. Then they wander off it. In this diagram the black line is the Main Sequence. The colored lines show temporal sequences. This progress through time of an individual star is called its evolutionary track. 

The Gary Seronik website that you cite is a good one - it's not leading you astray! There are a couple of important things to look at: 

You said "The thing that I am really puzzled about is that through the lens the image did not look like either of these pictures" - please could you clarify what you meant by lens here; were you talking about using the scope, Barlow and a separate eyepiece, or were you using scope, Barlow and DSLR with live preview lens? It is much more common for people to image the planets using a video stacked approach. The idea behind this is that they are very bright (so exposure times can be very short) and the limiting factor is random blurring caused by atmospheric seeing. If you take a video file of say 1000 frames at 20fps then there is software available that can combine these into good shots (e.g. AutoStakkert, Registax). What DSLR are you using? For what it's worth, the human eye is very good at picking details and resolving out the seeing on bright objects, so my first photo attempts were dreadful compared to what I could see in the eyepiece. I'd recommend you try reading up on this approach for inspiration. Some (but not all) DSLRs do allow video recording modes, so it might be worth a try. Saturn is definitely a tricky object to go for - at the time of writing Jupiter isn't in a good Northern Hemisphere space (I'd normally suggest trying it out as a somewhat easier target). Have you tried practising by imaging parts of the Moon - it's a much easier target to build confidence and practical experience? Please don't be disheartened ... it took me a couple of years to get semi-decent pictures of Saturn 

The Moon can appear in only about 48% of the sky* of a stationary Earth observer. The moon must be at least 61.4 degrees away from the celestial poles, such as the one near the North Star. 

Stars plotted by luminosity and surface temperature fit into patterns in a Hertzsprung–Russell diagram. A rough diagonal subset of this plot is called the main sequence. Is this in any sense a temporal sequence? There's a clue in the stellar physics section of the wikipedia article that the answer is no, but that it once was thought so: 

In this figure which I also just stole off the interwebs, the sphere does not represent Earth, it represents your sky, without the Earth in the way. O is you, call it the Observer, and the angle between the red lines is 57.2 degrees. And you need to imagine this tilted to the same extent as the equator in your sky. This shows that at latitudes higher than 61.4 degrees (90 minus 28.6), the moon could appear anywhere on your horizon. *48% is the sine of 28.6 degrees. That surprisingly simple calculation is the portion of the sky taken up by an equatorial band, based on the area of a spherical segment, $2\pi R h$ divided by the area of a hemisphere $2 \pi R^2$, which is $h / R$ or the sine of the angle. That's for a pole observer, but whether at the pole, the equator, or anywhere in between, you can see about half the band and half the sky. 

It certainly makes sense to me! Edit 13/09/2017 : as Dave points out in the comments, there are other motions, including the motion of the solar system around the galaxy, which is circa 514,000 mph. (See the Wikipedia Galactic Year article). And the motion of galaxies isn't neat and tidy either. 

I'm a "relativist", but I'm not on that page. Because of the CMBR. Google on CMBR reference frame and check out the CMBR dipole anisotropy. It isn't an absolute frame in the strict sense of the word. But you can use it to gauge your speed through the universe. And the universe is as absolute as it gets. 

By measuring the CMBR. There isn't much radiation compared to other stuff. The universe review dark energy article says radiation comprises only about 0.005% of the mass-energy of the universe. * Whilst conservation of p=mv momentum means there was an effect on the Earth, it's very slight. The KE=½mv² kinetic energy is not shared equally because the Earth didn't move in any detectable fashion. 

That's right, it uses gravity to "explain" gravity, so it isn't ideal. However there is a way to understand it, and IMHO it's simpler than you think. 

This is a really good question - and quite subtle. TL;DR; Earliest opportunity might be that inter-month changes in the stellar parallax of the Sun might lead the observer to conclude that either i) the Moon is a single, very large, rotating body or ii) it is part of a multi-body co-rotating system. However i) would seem to be inconsistent with a near and strongly curved horizon. If not then, certainly when we develop a quantitative model of orbital mechanics involving mass and gravity 

I don't think stellar parallax would directly help us as it (in the modern day) just tells us that we are in orbit around the sun and little about the Earth-Moon system itself. Let's look at how a Ptolemy equivalent on the Moon (call him Moon-Ptolemy) might see it. He would have no way of distinguishing the Earth-Moon system from his assumption that he is just sitting on a solid object at the center of creation. Of course he wouldn't see a "moon" in orbit around him, but he would see the Sun, stars and major planets. Stellar parallax (to him, the Sun "moving through the Zodiac) would just tell him that Sun is rotating around his Moon, as are the planets. The existence of planetary epicycles would be a curiosity required to make his model work - but it does work and he has no notion of the Earth Moon-Galileo might (or might not) be able to develop the heliocentric model - he misses out on one key insight that Earth-Galileo had: that the Earth wasn't special because other planets also had moons. Moon-Galileo would find the orbital system of Jupiter interesting but not a key insight, so he might not develop the new model. Even so, someone else would. Nevertheless, in a qualitative scientific world, there would still be nothing to help the Moon observer deduce the existence of the Earth behind the horizon. I suspect the truth would become unavoidable when orbital mechanics developed sufficiently to incorporate mass and gravity into calculation. It might have been around the time of Moon-Kepler. I'm not sure I agree with the comments looking at observations of the planets - I don't see how they help distinguish between an Earth-Moon system as opposed to a simple, very large, rotating Moon body with no co-orbiter (which would be a natural assumption to make). Even the monthly changes in parallax caused by the rotation of the Moon around the Earth might be waved away by suggesting the simple rotation of a much larger Moon body - though our hero might certainly question the compatibility of this with the apparent curvature and distance to their Moon horizon. 

I suppose we don't actually know for sure. But I can't think of any process whereby a stationary spherical body can emit regular pulses of radiation. 

See what I said above. Big bang cosmology doesn't actually say everything was condensed to point singularity. 

As to why this isn't common knowledge, I don't know. There's this myth that Einstein gave up on a varying speed of light in 1911, but he didn't, see this Wikipedia article and this example from 1914. I don't know why the reason matter falls down isn't common knowledge either. You know about pair production and electron diffraction and the wave nature of matter, just think of an electron as a wave going round a closed path, then simplify it to a square path, like this: 

Because it would otherwise end up falling faster than the speed of light. Sounds strange I know, but take a look at the Shapiro delay: "the speed of a light wave depends on the strength of the gravitational potential along its path". Or see Professor Ned Wright's Deflection and Delay of Light: "in a very real sense, the delay experienced by light passing a massive object is responsible for the deflection of the light": 

Don't worry about only having one support rather than four. The key will be to identify your centre dot (you can just see it on Seronik's webpage, first picture ) and to see how it is centred when you look through the collimation cap onto the secondary. Maybe read this article: $URL$ Or search for Newtonian Collimation on Youtube? 

Firstly, if you're planet spotting, don't worry too much about light pollution. The planets are some of the brightest objects in the sky and some (especially Jupiter) can easily be observed even with a full Moon - the full Moon (along with the Sun!) is the biggest contributor to light pollution! Take a look at the list of brightest stars ( $URL$ ), which also contains estimates for the brightness of the Sun, Moon and major planets. There aren't typically any stars brighter from Earth than Venus, Jupiter, Mars and Mercury and precious few brighter than Saturn. I'm going to suggest you probably have seen many of the planets - but just didn't recognise them. +1 for Stellarium ( $URL$ ). It's free, intuitive and very visual to use. You can put in your local viewing location and it gives you a view for any time of the night, future or past. At the time of writing (23 July 2017), Saturn and Jupiter should be looking good for the Southern Hemisphere. This rotates throughout the year, and Stellarium will help with this. Do a web search for "the sky at night in the southern hemisphere" and you'll find a number of examples of websites with highlights to look for when you get out. Couple of final suggestions: 

Nothing. I know this is hard to imagine, but try to. Space is expanding, and there is no space beyond it. So there is no beyond it. As to whether this means you end up coming back round full circle or the universe is some "hall of mirrors" or something else, I don't know. 

I wouldn't say it's stupid. But I would say it's presenting hypothesis as some kind of fact. For all we know our universe does have a centre and an edge. 

I'm afraid it isn't. Check out Is The Speed of Light Everywhere the Same? on the PhysicsFAQ website: "Does the speed of light change in air or water? Yes. Light is slowed down in transparent media such as air, water and glass." "These gyroscopes send light around a closed loop, and if the loop rotates, an observer riding on the loop will measure light to travel more slowly when it traverses the loop in one direction than when it traverses the loop in the opposite direction." "In this passage, Einstein is not talking about a freely falling frame, but rather about a frame at rest relative to a source of gravity. In such a frame, the not-quite-well-defined "speed" of light can differ from c, basically because of the effect of gravity (spacetime curvature) on clocks and rulers." The answer is no. The speed of light is not everywhere the same. But you measure the local speed of light to be the same because you define our seconds and your metres using light. So when you use them to measure the speed of that light, you always get the same answer. See Comments on "Note on varying speed of light theories" by Joao Magueijo and John Moffat. 

This is a slightly tricky one. For a conventional Newtonian reflector, shining a laser collimator back over the secondary to the primary should present a small dot on the primary - the task then is to adjust the secondary to center the dot on the primary - there is hopefully a mark on the primary. This is a reasonable general primer: $URL$ HOWEVER, the 114 is special, having a Barlow lens embedded in the bottom of the focuser. This would have the effect of spreading the laser light back into the telescope, leading to a projected shape (a disk or oval) on the primary. It's not really possible to conclude whether the collimator is collimated from this. Reading the manual ( $URL$ ), the manufacturer recommends a simple sight test: remove the eyepiece, and look down the focuser, adjusting the primary to center your eye (hence not worrying about the secondary alignment). Alternatively, you should be able to remove the Barlow lens by racking the focus tube all the way out and unscrewing it (do remember which way around it is mounted ...), which would allow the use of the laser. Simplest solution would be to use a low tech Cheshire collimator, I think. These forum discussions might give useful background: $URL$ $URL$ 

No, one might not. Because the universe doesn't expand for nothing. It expands because space has a kind of innate "pressure", as per the energy-pressure diagonal in the stress-energy-momentum tensor. And if the universe was infinite, the pressure would be counterbalanced at all locations. An infinite universe could not expand. 

No, and no. At least as far as I know. But most of what I know came from Frozen Star by George Greenstein. The first half of the book is all about neutron stars. It dates from 1984 and it could be a little out of date. But as far as I know there's not much wrong with it, and it's a good read regardless. Note that you can buy a second hand copy fairly cheaply. 

Because of the infinite gravitational time dilation. The thing to understand is that temperature is a measure of motion. A hot gas is one where the molecules are, on average, moving faster than in a cold gas. See the Wikipedia temperature article and note this: "The coldest theoretical temperature is absolute zero, at which the thermal motion of all fundamental particles in matter reaches a minimum". Gravitational time dilation means things are moving slower. When the gravitational time dilation is infinite, things aren't moving at all. This is why the black hole was originally known as the frozen star. Stephen Hawking wrote a paper in 1972 with Brandon Carter and Jim Bardeen where they said "It should however be emphasized that κ/8π and A are distinct from the temperature and entropy of the black hole. In fact the effective temperature of a black hole is absolute zero”. Robert Wald said much the same in black hole physics. On page 69 he said in classical black hole physics “κ has nothing whatever to do with the physical temperature of a black hole, which is absolute zero by any reasonable criteria”. The black hole is said to have an effective temperature by virtue of Hawking radiation, but as Fraser Cain said, it's very low. And as Mark said, "under GR alone, BHs are utterly black and don't have a temperature at all". More importantly, Hawking radiation is said to be emitted from outside the event horizon. So it isn't actually the temperature of the black hole. Just as "the accretion disk that surrounds a BH can be very hot indeed" but it isn't actually the temperature of the black hole.
