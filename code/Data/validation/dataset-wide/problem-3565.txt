Interestingly enough, there is a large difference between how power lifters train and how body builders train. Most body builders do splits of some sort, it's more common among power lifters to do whole body sessions every time. There aren't really very many good scientific studies, boths ways definitely work well. Personally, I just started a 3-split (push+abs, pull, legs+lower back) where I start with the heavy compound lifts and end with isolation exercises. My experience is that it's easier both mentally and in terms of energy to focus on one group at each session. Doing squats+deadlifts+bench press in the same session is too much. 

Afaik, the whole "exercise stunts growth" idea is a myth, as long as you eat enough, lifting weights will not interfere with your growth. Some people do weight lifting with explosiveness focus to get faster, but that should be done with a professional. 

There is no workout of any kind that will reduce fat on your stomach area specifically. Fat is the regulator your body uses to make sure you have enough energy every day, even if you don't eat as much energy as you use. So the only way to lose fat is to eat less than you use, this can be achieved by eating less or by exercising more. That way, a net loss of fat mass will occur. If by "fat cutter" you mean some kind of supplement, at least where I'm from, there are no legal supplements that will increase fat loss. There are illegal and dangerous supplements that can have a small effect, but you'll still need to have a net calorie deficiency to lose fat. Also, 15 days is no where near enough time to make any change. The smallest amount of time that can give you any visual change is something like 3 months of intelligent, effortfull exercise and a good diet. By then you'll start seeing some changes. 

Absolutely not necessary, deadlifts are great but still overrated. You can replace the deadlift with other exercises if you want to. You should give it a serious try though. 

If using something like mass gainer (mostly dexstrose) is the only way you're able to maintain a high calorie intake, then you will lose mass if you stop taking it. I don't think this is the case though, just eat more food generally and you will maintain your muscle weight. Creatine gives you a performance boost that can make you gain more muscle since you work harder in the gym, when you stop taking it, you will perform worse and that will decrease the signal that increase muscle mass. 

Personally, I think doing many reps of squats is so tough on your general endurance that the endurance will be the limiting factor, not muscle strength in the muscles I want to target, it will also make you much more tired during the rest of the workout, which is bad if it's part of a whole-body workout. Also, deadlifts, and to some extent, squats, are so critical to get right form-wise that many people keep the reps low to be able to get push themselves strength wise while maintaining good form and not injure themselves. Third, programs like starting strength that mimic powerlifting are "in" right now. People want functional strength, not those body building muscles that obviously aren't functional at all... ;) 

Sorry if this is a bit off-topic but I'd just like to share something as a heavy, flat-footed person. I'm 216 pounds at 5'10 and pretty much completely flat-footed, needless to say, running with regular shoes just doesn't work, I'll get some really intense pain in my lower legs after just a few km. Although very skeptical about the shoe business and their claims, I eventually bought a pair of running shoes with plenty of support and also insoles with high arch for flatfooted people, and it actually worked very well, I finished a 10 km race without too much pain. I know about the "you should strengthen your feet to overcome it" argument, but I just don't think that always works, there are limits to what the body can overcome and if you are heavy like me, those limits aren't as generous. 

I ran before lunch today, same breakfast and same lunch-size as always, I also lifted weights yesterday so it seems like I should be hungrier than usual. But I was too full to eat the dessert I bought with my lunch (I usually don't buy one.) On regular days, I could easily eat a desert after lunch if I had one. So my hypothesis is that cardio can actually decrease your appetite, has there been any studies to confirm this? Does anyone share my experience? How would this work biologically? 

Barbells lets you use significantly more weight than dumbbells because you don't have to use as much balance, very few people use dumbbells half as heavy as their barbells, personally, I can add about 25% of the weight I'd use with dumbbells in total. This means you can put a heavier load on your triceps, pecs and shoulders (maybe), which in turn means more mass building. 

Can't you use something else instead? Keep something heavy in your arms or put on a backpack an fill it with heavy stuff. When you can do at most 12 reps*3 sets you are working out at a level where you will be adding muscle mass efficiently. More than that and you're mostly gaining endurance. There are also harder versions of body weight squats you can do, like pistol squats, jump squats and box jumps. High rep squats will not make your butt smaller, why would it? 

It's not that important to eat after workouts, the most important factor is your total protein intake during the day. What kind of workout do you do? If it's just weight lifting you definitely do not need carbs after workouts. An average body can store 2000 kcal of glycogen (carbs), if you are a marathon runner or professional athlete, you'll have a hard time filling that store up, but it not a problem even with a high intensity weight lifting workout. So skip the carbs, drink a protein shake if you want to. 2 hours might be too much for optimal growth, depending on how you spend your time. 

Dropping 1 kg och fat while adding 4 kg of muscle in "a couple of months" is impossible for most people Adding 4 kg of pure muscle in a year is something that can pretty much only be achieved if you're completely new to lifting, if you work out perfectly and if you eat perfectly. You should aim for as large gains as possible though, and to achieve that, I would recommend that you first lose the fat and then go for a modest bulking phase, aim for 2 grams of protein per kg of body mass. There isn't really any evidence for larger gains with more protein than that. Wether you get your protein from meat or protein drinks doesn't make a huge difference. You might want to get some creatine if you eat low amounts of meat though. 

I think a well used caliper is what you're looking for, it might not tell you the exact fat% number, but the skin folds WILL decrease as you lose fat, meaning you can measure changes quite accurately. 

Soreness does not mean that you had a good workout (or vice versa), it means you had a workout you weren't used to. I've been lifting for a few years and I never feel sore, except for when I've had a long time off. 

It's true that it differs, some sources include, some do not, my experience is that the wast majority of sources include RMR-burned calories. There's a similar situation with BMR calculators, these tend to use formulas that exaggerate BMR, like harris & benedict. The reason is probably that people are happier to see that they walked one hour for 250 kcal instead of 150 kcal. 

Ok let's do some math. One pound of fat is about 3500 kcal, and is about 45 cl or 15 fluid ounces in volume. You don't mention your weight or your diet, but let's say you've lost 1000 kcal/day, which is a very high rate of calorie loss, in two weeks, that's 4 pounds, or 60 fl. oz./180 cl. This might sound like a lot, but considering the fact that your burn fat from all of your body, it's not a lot of fat. On the other hand, whenever you eat less, you will lose a lot weight in solids and fluids, this will also fluctuate a lot, you can assume that the error margin at your weigh ins are somewhere around 2% of your body weight, so having days of increased weight is perfectly normal. Regarding muscle building, as others have said, it's a lot harder to put on a pounds of muscle than it is to lose a pound of fat. If you stay the same weight over a year, 10 pounds of added muscle weight is a very good result if you're completely new to lifting, if you're a man, and if you rest and lift well. That's less than a pounds per month! If you lose weight, it's even harder. 

You don't mention your activity level, but assuming it's very low (add extra cals for any exercise), your daily requirement for keeping the same weight is 1857 kcal. If you aim for 1 pounds of weight loss per week, you should eat 1357 kcal/day. If you actually eat according to what you wrote, you should be losing weight. Are you sure you're being honest with yourself? It's very very easy to fool yourself more or less intentionally (I do it all the time...) If you're sure about your numbers, your next step should be to make sure you weigh yourself every morning before breakfast and after going to the restroom. Even if you do this, you will have days or even series of days where you don't seem to lose weight, that's why it's important to weigh yourself every day, it shows which weigh ins are relatively high in comparison to the trend. There's also something called the whoosh effect, not sure if it's scientifically observed, but basically what happens is that your fat cells take in water while they leave fat, making the weight seems similar, then suddenly, often after a night of heavy eating, whoosh, the water is expelled and a sharp weigh loss occurs. 

Practically speaking there won't be a difference for such a low amount as 100 grams, but if it's 1000 grams instead, I think it will be better to consume it over a week. 100 grams of chocolate will give some satiety and thus decrease your calory intake more in total than having 1000 grams in one sitting. If you assume your calorie intake is fixed and isn't affected like this though, eating 1000 grams in one sitting is still worse. The liver tends to store more visceral fat when overloaded, i.e. there is a threshold. Basically, if the liver is capable of taking 30 grams and using it for muscle glycogen and other things, that would mean that 1000-30 = 970 grams will hit your liver in one case, and 6*(1000/6 - 30) = 820 grams in the other case. That's pretty speculative though. I would also like to add that you can't really say that "all other factors remain equal", since your dietary intake affects many of the other factors, like energy usage. 

I like standing diagonally, because you have balance in all directions, you won't have to compensate with the curvature of your back as much to avoid falling over. Also, keep your core tight while pressing. 

Not breathing at all seems like a bad idea, especially at high reps. When you bench press, you should inhale as you lower the bar and exhale as you lift it. So I would try inhaling as lower yourself and so on, but I would also try the other way around and see what feels best. If it feels good and you perform well, it's the right way. 

Weight lifting will not affect your general growth, including height, as long as you don't starve yourself. If you want broader shoulders and a slimmer waist, do shoulder exercises and lose fat. 

Deadlifts and squats are both quite technical and should not be done if you're not very confident you have the right technique, but are very effective if you do. I prefer these exercises since you save time by training multiple muscles at once (rows: back + biceps) and because you'll be training a movement that you might actually use in real life. 

Start by doing what dieting people are doing: Count your calories, eat more. Drinking your calories might help, but avoid sodas. Milk or even beer is better in that case. Drink a gallon of milk each day and you will add weight. 

There are no distinct body types and they are for the most part not connected to personality, with the exception of eating habits. People with high apetite will have an easier time putting on both fat and muscle. So one could say that endomorphs tend to like food more than ectomorphs I guess, assuming that the higher body weight is caused to a larger degree by apetite than by any difference in metabolism. In fact, thin people typically overestimate the amount of calories they eat, while large people underestimate it, leading to the wide-spread myth of high or low metabolism being common. As I said above, there are no distinct body types, but there are body types! Some people are born shot putters and some are born marathon runners. Genes do have an impact, but they don't make people cluster around these three types. 

Do these five for 3 sets of 10 or 5 sets of 5 (it's important to not do too many reps if you're looking for strength) or for as long as you can, every other day and you will get stronger. It's absolutely not necessary to have access to a gym to get stronger. You can easily get better results with this if you are consistent focused and a bit creative in challenging yourself, than someone who goes to the gym 2 times a week and mostly dicks around. 

A 1200 pound deadlift would be a world record in any category (raw/equipped etc), so yeah he's lying. There doesn't seem to be a world record in standing military press, but the highest numbers I'm finding is around 500 pounds. 

As long as you're able to recover afterwards. It won't be your best workout but it will be better than no workout. 

Only the squats are heavily focused on your glutes, the others are more focused on quads, which would explain your gains on legs but not glutes. How come you have to get the bar above your head to do squats? No squat rack or such? I'd recommend squats or lunges with dumbbells to increase weight if you don't have a squat rack. There are also exercises that isolate the glutes that you could use, like standing hip extensions. 

Do you have a large (60+ liters) backpack? If so, fill it up with water (or better: sand) bottles and you can reach about 70-100 kg of weight. Put that on your back and do squats, lunges and other leg exercises. Ankle weights will not give you strong legs, they are far, far too light. 

To get visible abs, you need a combination of strong abs and low bodyfat. Saying that weight lifting or diet affects burns fat is like saying a high salary or low costs leads to wealth accumulation. If your calorie balance is below 0, you are burning fat, it's that simple, it applies to all diets. So if you want to know if you're making steps forward, use a scale. Fat loss almost always come with weight loss. If you're not losing weight, you're probably not losing fat either. Regarding ab size, it works exactly like other muscles, do ab exercises you can barely do for 10-12 reps, 3 sets. If you only want visible abs, isolation exercises are the most effective, if you want other qualities as well, do other exercises. Squats and deadlifts will hit your core, but not as intensely as pure ab exercises. Yoga might work, if it's hard and you are pushing your ab muscles toward their limit strength-wise. If not, it will not be very efficient. 

I had exactly this pain, unfortunately I can't recap the explaination I got from my physical therapist, but essentially it was an inbalance issue. Try this, keep your arms straight, hands facing eachother, about 20 cm appart, as low as possible, i.e. below your waist, then raise them slowly in front of you, arms straight, until hey are directly above your head. Any pain? If so, do the same thing, but hold a rope or something stretchy between your hands, palms still facing eachother and keep the rope stretched out, then do the same movement. If this is pain-free and the former wasn't you have an issue with keeping your shoulders down in certain movements. The exercises I got to do was external and internal rotations like here: $URL$ And the same rope-movement, 2 sets of 15, each day, with enough "pull" to make you tired in 15 reps, ideally you have something stretchy because it'll activate your muscles more. 

Healthy is a fuzzy term. It probably doesn't matter much if you eat trans fats, big macs and protein bars or salads, quinoa and turkey, assuming that the macro nutrient amounts are equal. What does matter is the amount of protein. Also, eating healthy, if it really is healthy, will make you live better and longer.
