The determinant formula for $\det (1/(x_i+y_j)^2)_{i,j}$ is due to Borchardt, see Krattenthaler's article given in Steve's answer, which contains a $(q)$-deformation of it as well. I want to mention, that Emmanuel Preissmann conjectured also a formula for the generalized Cauchy determinant identity $$\det \left(\frac{1}{(x_i+y_j)^k}\right)_{i,j}$$ for every $k\ge 1$, see $URL$ Further generalizations of Cauchy's determinant identity are given in Okada's paper $URL$ where $(1.6)$ is again Borchardt's identity. 

In the context of the "divisor problem for arithmetical progressions", there is the following article by Fouvry, Iwaniec and Katz, on "The divisor function over arithmetic progressions": $URL$ The authors use Fourier series techniques and Weil’s estimate for Kloosterman sums to obtain $$ S(x,m,k)-D(x,m)=\sum_{n\le x, n\equiv k(m)}d(n)-\frac{1}{\phi(m)}\sum_{n\le x,(n,m)=1}d(n)=O((m^{1/2}+x^{1/3})x^{\epsilon}). $$ We have the estimate $$ \phi(m)D(x,m)=\sum_{n\le x,(n,m)=1}d(n)=xP(\log x)+O(x^{1/2}m^{\epsilon}), $$ with $P(\log x)=\frac{\phi(m)^2}{m^2}(\log x+\gamma-1)+2\frac{\phi(m)}{m}\sum_{d\mid m}\frac{\mu(d)\log d}{d}$. Werner Georg Nowak proved in $1984$ that for any given natural numbers $m$ and $k$, $$ S(x,m,k)=\alpha x(\log x+2\gamma -1)+\beta x+ O(x^{35/108+\epsilon}), $$ for constants $\alpha$ and $\beta$ depending only on $m$ and $k$. 

Heisenberg groups over a finite field $\mathbb{F_q}$ with $q=2^m$ are abelian and its representations are all one-dimentional, i.e., characters. The classification of irreducible representations is given (among other references) in section $3$ of the article The Representations of the Heisenberg Group over a Finite Field by M. Misaghian. See section $2$ for the definition of the Heisenberg groups, also in characteristic $2$. 

This is not an answer, but just an observation, which Martin had probably in mind. By Fermat we know that $n=x^2+y^2$ is the sum of two squares iff the primes $p$ dividing $n$ with $p\equiv 3$ mod $4$ occur with even exponent. Suppose that $n=777\cdots 7$ has $k$ digits, and is the sum of two squares, $n=x^2+y^2$. Now we just study the first primes $p\equiv 3$ mod $4$ which possibly divide $n$. The prime $7$ is exceptional, because $7\mid n$ without any assumtion. We have $$ 6\mid k \Rightarrow 7^2\mid n,\quad 7\cdot 6\mid k \Rightarrow 7^3\mid n, \quad 7^2\cdot 6\mid k \Rightarrow 7^4\mid n,\ldots $$ $$ 2\mid k \Rightarrow 11 \mid n,\quad 2\cdot 11\mid k\Rightarrow 11^2\mid n,\quad 2\cdot 11^2\mid k \Rightarrow 11^3\mid n,\ldots $$ There is enough data for the factorization of $n$ here, multiplying $111\cdots 1$ there with $7$. If we do this with several such primes, we can say at least something on $k$, the number of digits of $n$: If $6\nmid k$, then $7^1$ is the exact power of $7$ dividing $n$; i.e., $7^1\mid\mid n$. This contradicts Fermat's result. Hence we can conclude that $6\mid k$. It implies $3\mid k$, so that $9\mid k$, because otherwise $3^1\mid\mid n$, which is impossible. Also $2\mid k$, so that $11\mid n$. This implies $198=11\cdot2\cdot 3^2\mid k$, because otherwise $11^1\mid \mid n$, which is impossible. This is what Martin already had. We may continue now that in particular $33\mid k$, i.e., $67\mid n$. Since if not $3\cdot 11\cdot 67\mid k$ then $67^1\mid \mid n$, we arrive at $13266=2\cdot 3^2\cdot 11\cdot 67\mid k$, etc. I have no idea whether this will continue, or whether we will finally find a possible $k$. 

Given the factorization of $n$, $\sigma(n)$ can be computed in polynomial time. (This follows immediately from the formula for $\sigma(n)$, given a prime factorization of $n$). Given $\sigma(n)$, we can produce the factorization of $n$ in random polynomial time. (This has been proved by Bach, Miller, Shallit 1986). 

This Lie algebra also arises in the classification of $3$-dimensional simple Lie algebras as follows: Theorem: let $L$ be a simple, $3$-dimensional Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field of characteristic $2$. Then $L\simeq W(2)$. If $e,f,h$ is a basis, then $[e,f]=h, [h,e]=e, [h,f]=f$. The Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ in characteristic $2$ is isomorphic to the Heisenberg Lie algebra, so no longer simple. In a sense the replacement for it here is $W(2)=W(1;2)^{(1)}$. 

There is a lot of research lately on so-called Hom-Lie algebras. A Hom-Lie Algebra is a vector space $L$ together with a bilinear skew-symmetric bracket, and a linear map $f:L \rightarrow L$ satisfying the Hom-Jacobi identity $$ [f(x),[y,z]]+[f(y),[z,x]]+[f(z),[x,y]]=0 $$ With $f=id+\epsilon g$, one obtains a Lie algebra for $\epsilon \to 0$. 

The article of Scott and Awyong, "INEQUALITIES FOR CONVEX SETS" containes several inequalities relating the area, perimeter, width, diameter, inradius and circumradius of planar convex sets. I tried to obtain the desired inequality (all of them have precise references given). Denote by $A$ the area, and by $d$ the diameter. At least, in the case $p\ge 3d$ (and I hope this will help) we obtain $$ A \ge \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}d(p-2d)\ge \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} d^2. $$ I did not check if we can obtain the inequality in another way. Some references claim that the inequality has been proved by Behrend (the german article), others relate it to Kubota. 

In the paper Derivation Double Lie Algebras the following result is proved: Theorem $3.2$: Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a simple Lie algebra of rank $r\ge 2$ over an algebraically closed field $K$ of characteristic zero, and $z\in \mathfrak{g}$. Suppose that $R={\rm ad}(z)$ is a classical $R$-matrix. Then $z=0$ and $R=0$. The proof uses the Jordan-Chevalley decomposition for $z=n+s$, the Jacobson-Morozov theorem, arguments concerning roots and algebraic group actions etc. This gives $s=0$ and ${\rm ad}(z)^3=0$, and finally $z=0$. For the case of rank $1$ we have the following result: Proposition $3.1$: Let $\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{C})$. Then $R={\rm ad}(z)$ is a classical $R$-matrix for all $z\in \mathfrak{g}$. The Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}_R$ is isomorphic to $\mathfrak{r}_{3,1}(\mathbb{C})$ for all $z\neq 0$. Here $\mathfrak{r}_{3,1}(\mathbb{C})$ is the $3$-dimensional solvable Lie algebra given by $[e_1,e_2]=e_2$ and $[e_1,e_3]=e_3$, and $\mathfrak{g}_R$ has bracket $[x,y]_R=[z,[x,y]]$. 

Here is another comment, which is not really an answer, but too long for a comment. If we have a plane algebraic curve $C$, given by, say $F(x,y)=0$, then we are interested in the set $C(\mathbb{Z})$ of integral points on $C$. This set by itself does not have any useful additional structure, but we might embed the curve $C $ into another object $J$, which is not a curve, but a surface. This can be constructed for any curve and is called the Jacobian variety $J$ of the curve. The point is, that $J$ is a group. Now Weil has proved in $1928$ the following: If $J$ is the Jacobian variety of a curve, then the abelian group $J(\mathbb{Z})$ is finitely generated. This means that we can (in principle) get an explicit description of the group $J(\mathbb{Z})$ in terms of generators and relations. If we have that, we may be able to use the group structure and the geometry in some way to describe the elements of $J(\mathbb{Z})$ which are in the image of $C$ - these are exactly the integral points on $C$. For details see the article of Bugeaud, Y.; Mignotte, M.; Siksek, S.; Stoll, M.; Tengely, Sz.: Integral points on hyperelliptic curves. They succesfully treat the equation $$ n(n+1)=\frac{m!}{60(m-5)!} $$ In fact, it follows that $m\in \lbrace{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 15, 19\rbrace}$. Of course, this does not mean we can treat $n(n+1)=m!$ this way, but at least there is hope for equations of type $\binom{n}{\ell}=\binom{m}{k}$. 

For the special case that $G=(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^n$, this is true. Then we have $d(G)=n$ and $Aut (G)=GL(n,p)$. In the article of A. Patterson, "The minimal number of generators for $p$-subgroups of $GL(n, p)$" of $1974$ it is shown that any $p$-subgroup of $\text{GL}(n,p)$, where $p$ is an odd prime, can be generated by ${\textstyle\frac 1{4}}n^2$ elements. So the bound is $\frac{1}{4}d(G)^2$ in this case. 

Grothendieck expected the moduli spaces $\mathcal{M}_{g,n}$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ to be the basic examples of anabelian varieties (besides hyperbolic curves, which was proved by Mochizuki, even over number fields, or more generally over sub-$p$-adic fields). The first non-trivial case is $(g,n)=(0,4)$, where we have $\mathcal{M}_{0,4}=\mathbb{P}^1_{\mathbb{Q}}\setminus \{0,1,\infty\}$. The only other moduli space of dimension $1$ is $\mathcal{M}_{1,1}$, the moduli space of elliptic curves. The geometry of these spaces has been described explicitly by cutting them into cells, enumerated by "fatgraphs" (equivalent to dessins d'enfants), and they are conjectured to be anabelian (I don't know further results, but I am not in this field. Certainly the question is very ambitious). 

Vergne's conjecture is still open. It says that there is no complex $n$-dimensional nilpotent Lie algebra which is rigid in the variety $\mathcal{L}_n(\mathbb{C})$ of all $n$-dimensional complex Lie algebras. The Grunewald and O’Halloran conjecture, which implies Vergne's conjecture, states that every complex nilpotent Lie algebra is the proper degeneration of another Lie algebra of the same dimension. The Heisenberg Lie algebra, with $[x,y]=z$ is rigid in $\mathcal{N}_3(\mathbb{C})$, but not in $\mathcal{L}_3(\mathbb{C})$, since it is a proper degeneration of $sl_2(\mathbb{C})$. R. Carles gives a necessary condition for a nilpotent Lie algebra $L$ to be rigid in $\mathcal{L}_n(\mathbb{C})$: it must be characteristically nilpotent, such that every ideal of codimension $1$ in $L$ is again characteristically nilpotent. It is not clear, whether Carles condition is also sufficient. Certainly the condition to be characteristically nilpotent is not sufficient. It is easy to construct characteristically nilpotent Lie algebras, which are not rigid. But even for the stronger condition of Carles, I found filiform nilpotent Lie algebras of dimension $n\ge 13$, which are characteristically nilpotent, and every ideal of codimension $1$ also being characteristically nilpotent. Unfortunately I do not know whether these algebras are rigid or not (there is a claim in the literature that no filiform nilpotent Lie algebra can be rigid in $\mathcal{L}_n(\mathbb{C})$, but I could not verify this, and did not find a valid proof). 

In answer to the comment, it is possible to compute a Groebner basis for the given example in a very short time, and from here one finds several solutions, e.g., a= 0, b= 0, c= (2260*h)/783, e= (863*h)/348, i= 0, f=( - sqrt(6016000*sqrt(852564769045) - 9064098136321))/(253200*sqrt(113)), j=( - sqrt(1050472*sqrt(852564769045) - 741915647113))/(63300*sqrt(226)), h=( - 783)/(100*sqrt(113)), d=( - sqrt(852564769045) + 212440)/715290. 

The question is also related to the so called cancellation problem for (not necessarily abelian) groups: If $G\times A\cong G\times B$, when does it follow that $A\cong B$ ? Perhaps it is worth to note that there is a positive answer for finite groups, and in some other related cases (if $G$ is to-Hom finite, and $A$ and $B$ are finite). Examples of to-Hom groups are quasicyclic groups and torsion-free groups. It is not true in general, of course, with the counterexample given in the above answer, where $A$ is a nontrivial group and $G$ the countable direct product of $A$ with itself. Then $G\times A \cong G \times \lbrace e \rbrace$, but $A\neq \lbrace e \rbrace$. 

A. L. Onishchik has classified decompositions $G=G_1G_2$ of redcutive Lie groups (e.g., see his article "Decompositions of reductive Lie groups" in Math. USSR-Sbornik, Vol. 9 (1969), No. 4). We have $G=G_1G_2$ with proper Lie subgroups $G_1,G_2$ if and only if $G_1$ is transitive on the homogeneous space $G/G_2$, or vice versa. This is equivalent to the fact that the corresponding Lie algebras satisfy $g=g_1+g_2$, as a sum of vector spaces, not necessarily a direct sum. For example, if the groups and Lie algebras are simple, one of the examples is $A_{2n-1}=A_{2n-2}+C_n$ for all $n\ge 2$, where the sum is not direct ($A_n$ is $sl (n+1)$ etc.). This is typical. For the groups it means, that we cannot deduce that the intersection $G_1\cap G_2$ is trivial. The classification shows, I believe, that this also applies to your case. 

Presentations for the Siegel modular groups $Sp(2g,\mathbb{Z})$ are closely related to presentations of the surface mapping class group.In general, the braid group $B_{2g+2}$ acts on the free group $F_{2g}$, inducing a homomorphism from $B_{2g+2}$ into $Sp(2g,\mathbb{Z})$. For $g=2$, Kassel has shown that the latter homomorphism is surjective and has determined its kernel (thus obtaining a braid-type presentation of $Sp(4,\mathbb{Z})$). The article discusses how exactly Behr's presentation and Bender's slightly shortened presentation can be interpreted this way. The link is:arxiv.org/pdf/1204.2377, and there Theorem $4.3$ and its proof. I hope this helps. 

It is well known that $\sum_{k\le x} \phi(k)=\frac{3}{\pi^2}x^2+O(x\log(x))$. In a similar way we obtain $$ \sum_{k\le x} \frac{\phi(k)}{k}=\frac{6}{\pi^2}x+O(\log(x)), $$ by using the Moebius function, i.e., $\sum_{k\le x} \frac{\phi(k)}{k}=\sum_{k\le x}\sum_{d\mid k}\frac{\mu(d)}{d}=\sum_{d\le x}\frac{\mu(d)}{d}\lfloor \frac{x}{d}\rfloor$. Then $$ \sum_{k\le x} \frac{\phi(k)}{k}=x\sum_{d\le x}\frac{\mu(d)}{d^2}-\sum_{d\le x}\frac{\mu(d)}{d}((x/d))=\frac{6}{\pi^2}x+O(\log(x)). $$ Edit: The term $O(1)$ (which I hade before from the paper of Carella) is not correct, please see the valuable comment of Peter. The value $6/\pi^2$ is reasonably good for the question posed, if $n$ is large. 

Classical groups are really a classical topic and have been studied a lot. It is therefore not easy to find some interesting topics which are still accessible. Certainly there are some aspects of unitary representations of classical groups, which are interesting but also not too technical. Also, studying Clifford algebras and classical groups is an accessible topic. An active field is also the geometry and algebra of classical groups over finite fields - but you wanted real or complex numbers. Finally, I agree with the comments that there should be advice for you from your supervisors, which certainly know much better than me what topics are suitable. 

A converse of Whitehead's first and second lemma has been recently studied by P. Zusmanovich, e.g., see here. One of the results is as follows: Theorem 0.2 (A converse to the Second Whitehead Lemma). A finite-dimensional Lie algebra over a field of characteristic zero such that its second cohomology with coefficients in any finite-dimensional module vanishes, is one of the following: (i) an one-dimensional algebra; (ii) a semisimple algebra; (iii) the direct sum of a semisimple algebra and an one-dimensional algebra. If you only require that $H^2$ vanishes for the trivial representation, we have much less, of course. By Dixmier's result, such a Lie algebra cannot be nilpotent. It might be solvable, however, e.g., a solvable, non-nilpotentent strongly rigid Lie algebra. More details are in Zusmanovich's paper.
