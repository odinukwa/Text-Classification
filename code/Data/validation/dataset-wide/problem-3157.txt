I'd say nothing related to population, climate or geography. It was a problem of timing. In fact, if you shift places, changing Germany by Gaul for example, Caesar would have conquerer Germany in the same way he did with Gaul. Rome greatness was due its institutions, once they fell, Rome declined as well. After the fall of the Republic, Rome grew only when efficient emperors stayed in power for enough time, like the Antonines, after that civil wars consumed the energy of the Empire. The only thing related to population might be the lack of citizens in the army, because with time the army was composed by mercenaries working for its general, instead of former army composed by citizens working for its city. 

I'll add some metallurgy information to complement the answers. There are several different kinds of steel. The basic one, which is iron and carbon, has different behaviors depending of the % of carbon in the alloy. Few carbon and you have mostly iron, which is soft and malleable, while a lot of carbon means that the steel will be hard but fragile. Since is difficult to achieve the correct amount of carbon in an steel alloy, or to remove all carbon to have pure iron, not always the steel is better than bronze. Therefore, depending of the quality of the smith, bronze would be still competitive against a bad iron/steel. 

If you have a single line, it means that a man fights until exhaustion or death. While when you have several lines, you can rotate them to let them rest and keep fresh men fighting. In real battles men don't die while fighting in the line, most casualties occur when the line breaks and disbands, because when the line opens each man loose the protection of his neighbors. Therefore, in ancient battles the purpose of the fight was to hold the line more time than your enemy and prevent an attack from behind or the sides. Finally, when you have several lines, you have a reserve to cover gaps or prevent a side attack. I strongly recommend a nice historial novel which describes the live of Scipio, wrote by Santiago Posteguillo. He describes the battle of Zama and Magnesia, with all changes in the lines while the men fight. 

Are there any maps still surviving that were made in the Byzantine Empire? There are plenty of maps from Western Europe during this time period, but I haven't heard of any surviving from the eastern empire. 

The way he actually got home is as absurd as the expedition itself. After nearly a year in the desolate and uninhabited Franz Josef Land, an unexplored archipelago the size of Serbia, the two men just happened to bump into someone -- and it was even someone Nansen knew personally, Frederick Jackson leading an unrelated expedition. They got a ride back on Jackson's supply ship. 

Is there a single, unified place where one can look up cuneiform signs for Sumerian words? Unicode now supports cuneiform, but every source I've found has only transliterations, not actual cuneiform. For example, I'd like to find this: 

I've heard many times that the Commerce Clause of the US Constitution was (in part) designed to end tariffs between the thirteen states. Now that I'm trying to learn about those tariffs, I'm having a very hard time finding any information about them at all. 

The US military uses a scale of alert readiness called DEFCON, with DEFCON 5 being the lowest alert level and DEFCON 1 being the highest, preparing for imminent nuclear war. At least once during the Cold War, readiness was pushed all the way to DEFCON 2. When DEFCON levels were raised, how secret was this? Did the Soviet Union know when DEFCON levels changed? 

The American Revolution isn't the kind of thing I'm thinking of; everyone knew where the faultlines ran before the revolution began. Benedict Arnold, on the other hand, would be closer to what I'm thinking of; he was a trusted American officer who betrayed his own side, but unsuccessfully. 

Since we are talking of two different sources, we do not know whether their interpretation is the same, specially regarding to wounded men. Light wounds might not be counted in the Royal Navy in the same way that US Navy. Another potential explanation is that UK had more deaths in the beginning of the war, while US had them later, when medical attention was better. If we check total data from all service branchs we might see the following from wikipedia: UK deaths: 383,700 UK wounded: 376,239 US deaths: 407,300 US wounded: 671,801 As we can see, the ratio is different for both countries, hence we can't say that the difference was only in the naval branches, US had always more wounded. Hence the ships are not related to the statistics. 

First I'll suggest to read the books Age of Capital and Age of Empire of Eric Hobsbawm. Now a small list of factors: 1. Industrialization. Because you need new markets and access to resources. 2. Population grow. Industrialization improves agricultural yield thanks to machines and canalization works, that increases the population and the pressure to find new lands. 3. Technology and sanitation. I put both things together because the improvement of knowledge on medicine helped to prevent diseases. This is particularly important in the case of Africa, where europeans died of malaria in great numbers. Besides, the weapons given by the industry gave to the european countries a huge advantage over the nations they subdued. Now, why England was more successful than other countries? Basically because their industrialization was earlier, therefore they had the urge to search for new markets before anyone else. Besides, the recent independence of United States removed from the map the most important overseas market for England, that's why the had to go for new colonies. Finally, they were the most important naval power, which is required to launch military raids and invasions in other lands. Each country searchs for colonies and new markets when they reach industrialization and they have a surplus. 

According to the Treaty of New Echota, ratified by the US Senate in 1836, the US government was supposed to pay the Cherokee Nation $5 million for their lands in and around Georgia. In exchange, the Cherokee would leave that region and settle across the Mississippi. Did the government actually pay the $5 million? I know there was a division among the Cherokee of whether to accept the treaty or not, and most of them chose to remain on their land, then being forcibly removed (which is a different sad story). But the removal of the Cherokee was done under the auspices of the Treaty of New Echota, so was the payment required by the treaty ever made? 

They're described in the article as clay cylinders, which is quite different from all the types of beehives I've ever seen. 

There's a place in Alberta called Fort Assiniboine. Today it's a small village, but in the days of the fur trade, it was a fort and trading post for the Hudson's Bay Company. The Assiniboine people are an American Indian / First Nations tribe from the Great Plains, but all the maps I've seen of their territory don't come anywhere near Fort Assiniboine. 

(For context, I'm reading about the Panic of 1819, which arose in the context of American grain being sold to Europe. The economic panic had large effects on banking in America.) 

During Robert Scott's British Antarctic Expedition (1910-1913), they used ponies in many cases to haul supplies across the ice. What exactly did the ponies eat? I've found many references to the fact that their food had to be carried along by the expedition, but I haven't been able to find out what exactly that food was. Normally, horses eat a mix of roughage (like grass or hay) along with something more nutritious, like corn or oats. 

Economic Progress and Globalization: Since WW2, most countries have been so busy in rebuilding their Economies or sustaining Growth and Development, that war never got a priority that it once used to get (like during the 1800-1900 era). Especially since the 1990s when Globalization and Liberalization has taken speed, any country will have a lot more to loose (in terms of market establishment and decline in growth) by going to war (particularly for the super-powers who actually have that potential). Nuclear Deterrent: America's demonstration of almost instant annihilation by dropping atom bombs at Japan in 1945 has since acted as a major deterrent for any other country to start a war-like scenario. For the first time, people knew that such great destruction could be caused within seconds of timescale that entire cities could be annihilated. The result: Each country started racing towards building more and more sophisticated nuclear weapons (America's total defense budget is more than a small country's entire economy's worth!). But no super-power will ever use it today, because due to sophisticated radar technologies, the enemy country will know even before the weapon has entered their borders, and their nuclear weapons would be instantly triggered causing absolute annihilation to both sides. The United States: Since WW2, the USA has emerged as the single largest super-power in the world. Since it demonstrated its power by dropping the atom bombs in Japan, USA has since acted as a by keeping other smaller countries in check. USA has had its way wherever it wanted, and this has discouraged many other countries from going to war. For instance, think about the Iraq invasion of Kuwait in 1991. What would have happened if USA hadn't intervened by means of ? Iraq would have turned into a bully by invading more Kuwaits and the whole of middle-east would have plunged into a world-war! (Its a different matter that USA had its own interests in that war - , but the result has been an aversion of a major war.) 

Sure, it's possible. Many things are possible. Likely, however, is another question. The link you posted describes a vague story of sailing west into the Atlantic, finding an island, trading with the locals, and returning home. Could the island be in the New World? It could, but it could just as easily be one of the islands in the Atlantic. For me to consider the story at all plausible, I'd want to see an account of the journey that describes something you'd only find in the Americas and was definitely written before 1492. To move it from plausible to probable, I'd want to see physical evidence of the contact. 

The Ohio Company was formed in 1748 to bring English settlement to the Ohio Country. At that time, the Ohio Country was largely uninhabited, as the Iroquois had driven out or exterminated the tribes previously inhabiting the area. Then, in 1754, the French and Indian War started; control of the Ohio Country being one of the disputes between the major powers. Were there any European/American settlements in the Ohio Country established before the war that survived after the war was over? 

What was the main food source in California during the Spanish and Mexican periods? I'm expecting it was either corn or wheat, but I don't know which. 

Reading an interesting article in Forbes, I was dumbfounded by the idea that Ted Kennedy might have sought out Yuri Andropov's help to run for president against Ronald Reagan in 1984. A relevant summary from the article: 

In the 1600s, the nature of the moon was a matter of debate. Papers arguing for the modern concept of the moon were being printed, such as The Discovery of a World in the Moone, 1638. The phrase a world in the moon referred to the idea that the moon was a solid, round body on which people could walk about, like our own earth. Today this is completely uncontroversial, which raises my question: In the 1600s, what was the opposing position? If you didn't believe that there was a world in the moon, what did you believe? For example, the authors of the text cited above argued a number of points about the moon: that it was solid, that it was opaque, that it reflected the light of the sun, and (as a separate point) that there was a world in the moon. What did people believe about the moon before such papers convinced them otherwise?
