If the goal is simply to produce electricity, then yes. You produce electricity without metal all the time in the form of static discharge. Rubbing two pieces of fur together or a piece of amber and a piece of fur together produce fairly impressive amounts of static electricity. As a matter of fact, peoples in the classical period observed electrostatic effects by rubbing cats with amber rods. In the 1600's when a chemist named William Gilbert first gave a scientific name to the phenomena he coined the term "electricus" which is Latin for "like amber" or "from amber," based on the greek term "elektron" which simply meant amber. However, I get the feeling you are more looking for some sort of civilization that has harnessed electricity for useful purposes. I am sorry but there is no way to do so without possessing a firm grasp of metallurgy and metalworking. 

Thinking too far Ahead You are basically trying to invent a better flashlight battery before light bulbs were invented. Look into early wireless telegraph transmitters. 

Anabolic steroids cause more long term damage to the body's ability to regulate it's own hormones than the value gained in muscle growth. When on steroids your body ceases producing those hormones all together, the longer you are on them the longer it takes your body to begin producing those hormones on its own again. After long enough use your body's ability to regulate its hormone levels can be permanantly damaged. Anabolic steroids also cause damage to major organs like the liver, heart, and kidneys. To put it simply, steroids to combat micro gravity muscle atrophy is like drinking to cure depression. 

Experiences From a Modern Battlefield Frankly, hearing is of pretty limited use in modern combat. When you have multiple automatic weapons firing, explosions, screaming, vehicles, aircraft coming in low and hot, more explosions, and more gunfire it becomes apocalyptically loud. I remember my gunny grabbing me by my helmet, yanking my head down and screaming in my ear that we needed to call in medieval and being totally unable to hear him, he ended up just having to shove a radio and a 9-line evac template card into my hands so I could understand what he was saying. We had to move the radio back from the engagement area by a few hundred yards to be heard by battalion over the noise. An no point during 2 combat tours totaling 18 months in total duration between the two was my hearing ever a factor in locating an enemy beyond "oh crap, machine gun fire from over there!". When both parties have high powered modern weaponry they tend to not get very close to each-other to engage. The idea that combatants are stalking around silently straining their ears to hear a nearby hidden enemy makes for good drama but it just doesn't really happen. If the enemy were ever within 200 meters of us it was essentially a point blank engagement and things got very loud and very messy very quickly. The worst part of combat concerning hearing wasn't that I wished I could hear better, but that I could somehow have hearing protection that would filter out what I didn't need while still allowing me to communicate to my squad. In movies everybody had neat little radio headsets, in reality there's two radios for the whole squad, and a headset is less that useless because now you are carrying around about 20 pounds of batteries to power something that isn't even useful once you actually need it. I did do a "non-combat" deployment into Ramadi where our squad was attached to a Navy SEAL team to "instruct" local Iraqi army recruits how to fight, in reality we just raided ISIS explosives caches and obtained intel for airstrikes. The SEALS had this neat headset thing that amplified sound when you were wearing it but would shut off amplification when things got loud, and it had a radio built into it that also boosts radio chatter volume when it detected high noise. The SEALs had them because well, they're SEALs, They get the best gear without question. At $2500 a pop the military doesn't see fit to hand said headsets out to everybody because contrary to popular belief, main battle fighting groups are issued the most economical gear, not the latest gear. I have no way how you would obtain this functionality from genetic modification, that's really not my area of expertise. All I can say is what requirement I would have liked to have on my battlefield and that a technological solution exists already, its just not included in the regular Infantry's general gear issue yet. 

If it is a medieval or close equivalent in culture and technology then yes, they will always have enemies. However, one of the fun perks of being the wealthy merchant class means that you don't have to fight your own battles, you can hire mercenaries for that. They can use that large river to send trade barges down to the major human settlements and trade hubs guarded by hired human warriors. Also, they can maintain security diplomatically as well. The human societies profit greatly from the resale value of the technological items they purchase from the gnomes, and anything that threatens their access to such trade threatens the economic well being of the kingdom. Several kingdoms might be pledged to agreements of mutual support guaranteeing that if anyone attacks the gnomes its a given that they also must fight at least one other major kingdom as well, if not a confederation of them. Perhaps, instead of mercenaries the kingdoms that the gnomes trade with donate a certain amount of manpower towards defending the gnomish city. In exchange for healthy paychecks and favorable trade discounts with the kingdoms that pledge the men the gnomes gain a standing army securing their holdings. 

A 2 Dimensional Being Cant Comprehend the 3rd Dimension.... To a 2 dimensional being you will only ever be a line segment with width corresponding to the amount of material in which your body bisects his plane of perception. To a 2 dimensional being a sphere would simply be a growing and shrinking circle as it passed through his plane of perception. There is no way he could ever possibly perceive or understand what more than 2 dimensions were without himself becoming a 3 dimensional being. ...So we Will have to Translate Things to His Perceptions As far as setting up a computer interface for him to both read and access data it would need to be translated from out spatial perceptions into his. I'm thinking a laser projected keyboard would need to be adapted into 2 dimensional symbols that he could decipher as letters of our alphabet. 

Organise an order of guardians who are carefully selected for their unique abilities and strength. Their ultimate goal is to confront the big bad, but in the meantime they are guardians of society who are sent out to hone their skills and establish a heroic tradition against all the various little bad guys running around out there. They become an order that passes on it's traditions and knowledge to succeeding generations of guardians perfecting their tactics and knowledge towards to goal of being able to confront the long prophesied return of the big-bad. Maybe society forgets about the big bad and begins to claim he's just a metaphoric legend and never actually literally existed. They view the order of guardians as archaic, backwards, and somewhat odd, but they have a real track record of dealing with other hazards so they are still looked up to. But the guardians never forgot their purpose, and as the time draws nigh for the big bad's rebirth they put everything they have learned and all the power and wealth they have accumulated over a thousand years to the task of preparing. They establish secret groups of lesser believers who didn't make the cut for full guardian status but are still useful lead by one or two full members. They establish these resistance cells anywhere they can so that when the big bad awakens they will be spread out and ready to wage a protracted campaign of resistance against the dark lord of evilness. That way your order of heroes doesn't get outright obliterated as soon as big-nasty awakens, and are able to slowly and carefully engage him on their own terms until the opportune moment arises to attack him in full force. They are basically spending a thousand years planning every opportunity to get in lord badness's way with minimal risk to themselves until the moment to defeat or banish him arises.
