In addition to the answer above (and I realize this is an old question and perhaps better for world building), but what we know about climate, some subtle changes can have pretty big effects. If you increase the axial tilt a few degrees that would make the variation in sunlight winter to summer greater and would make colder winters and warmer summers, but the effect of warmer summers is that glaciers would have a harder time growing. You could also increase the planet's greenhouse gas. You could also create more ocean surface area and less land. Oceans are good temperature stabilizers and with strong ocean currents, you might get a year-round warm water flow towards the continent on the pole, leading to a warming of the land on the pole, much the same way Europe is warmer than similar latitudes in other places on earth, due to the warm mid Atlantic current. More ocean surface area and a strong oceanic conveyor might be the simplest explanation, creating a regular stream of warm air that blows onto your continent on the pole. Or you could give the planet a slower rotation and longer days (colder nights), but during the summer, snow would melt during the longer day - also preventing glacial buildup. For your scenario, glaciers on Mountains is fine, but you don't want glaciers spreading across land like we have in Greenland and Antarctica. For a warmer pole continent, you need some combination of effects that would prevent glacial growth. Glacial growth on land and a decline in oceanic circulation is thought to be the cause of the ice age period that began about 2.6 million years ago. Similarly, land over the pole is thought to be what lead to the Karoo ice age. You'd need a mechanism to make your land on the pole warmer (like some of the mechanisms above). On river runoff: River water usually (but not always) requires snow melt. If you have a lot of snow that melts over the year (like the Himalayas), that would create a lot of large rivers but I don't think those rivers would warm the land very effectively. Rivers respond to land temperature and snow/ice melt and weather patterns, more than they control them. Other methods like more greenhouse gas, a bigger ocean with a strong conveyor or some orbital changes are the best methods I can think of for your scenario. 

Silicon. Silicon is usually oxidized, SiO2. It doesn’t have to have that ratio. Other silicon compounds are possible, eg carborundum SiC, and perryite Fe5Si2 which is stable in acid water, silicon nitride Si3N4, silicon phosphide SiP2 etc . Siloxanes can have ratio Si:O of 1:1. Low molecular weight siloxanes are produced by modern anaerobic biogas fermenters, though it could possibly be eukaryotes producing them. There is potentially a tremendous amount of SiO2 available to release oxygen, although only a little of it is soluble at any one time. 

H2 SO3 -> S + H2O + O2. Sulfur can be oxidized -- SO3. Or it can replace Oxygen as an oxidizer -- H2O -> H2S etc. So by changing states it could affect free O2. And solid sulfur could wind up on the ocean bottom where it would be subducted. 

If we take that averaged 6.5°C per km, that explains pretty close to the surface temperature variation on the Earth at sea level. (Antarctica, being mostly more than a mile in elevation, you need to adjust the temperature -6.5°C per km in altitude for surface temperature). The troposphere being an average of 8 km higher at the equator, corresponds to 52°c variation using that -6.5 degree estimate, or about 32 degrees (equator) to minus 20 (pole), which is very much in the ballpark. Also, as noted in the wikipedia article 

I can list the cycles and possible cycles that I know of. You mentioned the Milankovich cycles, 26,000 (or 21,000), 41,000 and about 100,000 (with some fluctuation), are pretty much like clockwork and are timed pretty well with historical ice ages, so those are confirmed cycles, but they also occur very slowly. The Sahara desert may cycle from lush rain forest to desert back to rain forest every 26,000 years. That said, the orbital changes are not thought to be a big factor today. We're likely in the middle of a warm period between ice ages, perhaps in a gradual cooling. Solar Minimums The sun cycles between high and low sunspot periods on roughly an 11 year cycle. High sunspot activity does give the Earth slightly more energy but the effect of this is pretty small, maybe 1/4 of 1 degree C maximum to minimum, less than the 1 degree plus that the CO2 has already warmed the earth. Still 1/4 of 1 degree can have an effect if the sun enters an extended minimum. This may be the cause of the little ice age. Maunder Minimum and Little Ice age A recent study suggested that the sun might enter a new long term (Maunder like) minimum and that it may happen every few hundred years, but the cooling from this is likely smaller than the warming already experienced from CO2. (I have a link, need to track it down) Ocean currents This is very complex and difficult to predict. We know that El Ninos and La Nina's tend to roughly alternate. El Nino's are associated with a warmer ocean current on the surface that warms teh air (and has numerous other global weather effects) and La Nina is a cooler ocean current on the surface that warms the air less/cools it more and there are also predictible weather effects all over the planet. La Nina and El Nino aren't exactly on a cycle any more than heavy snow fall winters and light snow fall winters are on a cycle, they're more like chance, for lack of a better word, though they must be caused by something but as far as I know there's no good predictive methods beyond a few months ahead of time. I think it's unlikely that La Nina and El Nino play key roles in global climate change though, but there's no definitive evidence. Longer term ocean currents are often used by climate change skeptics, like 30 year ocean cycles, because, if you squint just right, they can argue that the global temperature has risen and fallen on a 30 year cycle. (They really haven't), but it looks like there could be some truth to that. See chart here (for some reason I couldn't embed) $URL$ Source: $URL$ Now it looks like the Earth cooled 1880-1910, warmed 1910-early 1940s, cooled a little / stayed about flat 1940-1975 and warmed 1975 to present. It sounds like a good argument but 2 periods is much too short a time period to draw any good conclusions, especially if the argument is largely circumstantial without a clear cause and effect, and lets not forget, the warming since the 1970s has blown out of the water any measured 30 year period before then, so the current warming doesn't fit the model. Volcanoes While not really a "cycle" volcanoes can have measurable effects on climate, but only very large ones, so this happens maybe 1-2 times a century. The last cooling volcano happened in 1991 and may have cooled the earth about 1/2 of 1 degree, which is actually a lot, but it's also, quite temporary. A few years after the Volcano the Earth was setting heat records again and by 1998 with the large El Nino, global temperatures blew the previous records out of the water. Liars see chart here: $URL$ Roy Spencer suggests that during the medieval warm period it was 1 or 2 degrees hotter than today. I think he's basically lying because he's the only person producing charts like this. There's another scientist (I forget his name) who only studies the Greenland ice sheet which can be prone to local variations and not give a good picture of global temperatures. Locally there can be fairly significant temperature variation but, and this is important, there's a difference between natural variation and cycles. Cycles by definition have causes. Natural variation tends to be more local than global, though there are global variations year to year, where the biggest drivers are probably El Nino/La Nina and the occasional once in a century volcanic eruption. Other smaller effects like cloud cover and snow cover/reflection probably play roles too. But in a certain sense, all this is just movement of temperature and (OK clouds and snow can reflect solar energy away directly) but oceans, the primary cause used for cycles don't change the total heat in the system so much as they move it around. The sun, another commonly misused cause for cycles, doesn't vary enough to explain the current warming, so it's likely that most of the people saying "it's a cycle" are simply wrong. Though it's possible that part of the warming is riding a so far unexplained cycle, it's very unlikely that most of it is. The simplest way to look at climate change is energy in and energy out. $URL$ This is grossly over simplified but 29% of the suns energy is reflected directly back into space, 23% warms the atmosphere and 48% warms the surface. The earth, when in equilibrium, gives back the same amount of energy that it receives, of that 71%, only 12% radiates from the surface of the earth and 59% radiates into space from the atmosphere. Small changes in radiation away from the earth (which is how greenhouse gas works) gradually increase the total heat of the earth, and most of this heat goes into the oceans, some melts ice and only about 3% stays in the atmosphere, which slowly warms the atmosphere, the current estimate is about 2 degrees C every 100 years (and the ocean warming, likely even slower than that, maybe 1 degree on the surface every 100 years or more and even more gradual warming in the middle and deeper oceans. All that is very one-dimensional as it doesn't take into account evaporation and cloud formation, changes in plant transporation, changes in desert vs green land cover, changes in ice cover, humidity etc. It's a hugely complicated system, BUT, there is very good evidence that the atmosphere is trapping heat and the earth is taking in more energy from the sun than it is currently returning to space and that's the single most important bit of evidence. So called 30 year ocean cycles are very much worth studying but likely not causing and unlikely to prevent man made climate change. Solar cycles are worth studying and may even exist over every few centuries, but they are probably too small to prevent the greenhouse gas warming. Other "undiscovered" cycles, well, sounds good, but without a testable theory, that's not real science. That was probably too long, but there it is. 

Or bacteria could have metabolized silicic acid into insoluble compounds that had less oxygen. This is entirely hypothetical since only a little carborundum has been discovered, and the rest would have had to be subducted. Banded iron formations do though have layers of amorphous quartz. Silicon dioxide was being removed from the water. Perhaps it was alternately iron being removed while soluble siloxanes accumulated in water, and then the siloxanes were converted to silica and removed while iron accumulated in water. It was a complicated web of reactions. Photosynthesis provided the energy to create energy-rich chemicals. Meanwhile every organism that was not photosynthetic was busy finding its best mix of catalyzing chemical reactions that provided energy, versus creating the molecules needed to grow and reproduce. Strange things happened. 

The 2nd part, the change in salinity is (to my knowledge, and I invite correction from anyone who studies this professionally), but from what I've read, it's much more complicated to model than LHF. It's certainly something that researchers are aware of, both the warming arctic and changes in salinity might effect ocean currents. Unlike air, where temperature drives density and that leads to low and high pressure and updrafts and basically, weather, oceans have two factors that can effect water density - temperature and salinity. Warm water is lighter than cold water, but lower salinity water is also lighter than warmer, more salty water. Small changes in salinity in ocean surface water doesn't have any real effect on temperature directly, but the effect on ocean currents is worth studying because changes in ocean currents can effect temperature significantly, certainly on a local scale, and globally too. Modelling this, like modeling the rate of future glacial melt, may be close to impossible and when it's written about, it can sound more alarmist than science, so it's a subject that has 2 key problems, difficult to predict (even in the hard to predict climate change models the effect of salinity changes on ocean currents are especially tricky), and it's the kind of thing that might invite shouts from the other side, like Wiesław Masłowski's infamous study that suggested the arctic might be ice-free by 2013. He was a graduate student, not a climate scientist and his was a good study and preliminary. It should have been subject to peer review, instead, (in part because Al Gore used his study in a speech), it became a famous example to alarmism and was subject to much ridicule that persists to this day. Scientists are certainly aware of the possible effects of salinity changes and the effect that might have on ocean currents, but it's very difficult to model and mostly written about observed effects in the present, and mostly not written regarding future forecasts. Predictions like "the Atlantic current could shut down" may be based in science, but low probability predictions like that tend to invite criticism. Fresh water/ice melt is discussed in Wikipedia here and here's an article where the opposite is happening. As arctic sea ice recedes, the lighter, less salty water on top isn't present as much as it used to be and the arctic-ocean stratification is going away. Article on that here. It's also worth noting that glacier fed rivers will affect the ecosystem down-river, putting less or more water into the environment leading to less or more greening and less or more water evaporating off the river into the atmosphere. It's more common for rivers to be fed by snow melt than glacial melt, but the glacial melt should be studied too. Changes in greening down-river and in atmospheric water vapor also effect climate, so, as someone said in the comments, there are a lot of moving parts to the climate picture. Generally speaking, scientists are aware of all of this and as much as possible, study it and include it in models. 

The question There's a lot of free oxygen now. This oxygen did not suddenly come from underground or from space. So it used to be attached to something. The question is, what was it attached to, and what happened to what it was attached to? 

2 NO2 + 4 H+ = N2 + O2 + 2 H2O Perhaps there was a time when the atmosphere had only 75% as much N2 as it does now, and no O2. This reaction would imply the oceans used to be more acidic than they are now. But there could be other reactions that would counteract that, and there were lots of other buffers. 

TLDR, but here goes: There's a few factors to consider regarding the relatively tiny 2 degrees C and I'm not sure how to explain this without being long, but obviously you're correct, we hardly notice a 2 degree change ourselves. But if you look at the total energy of Earth you can get a slightly better picture. The numbers below are only approximations but should be close enough to give an idea of how the trapped heat plays in the Earth's atmosphere and oceans. The sun shines on the Earth about 1.8*10^17 Joules per second, or about 5.6*10^24 joules per year. Source. Remember that number, I'll reference it a few times. The rough division is about 48% of that hits the surface, 23% is absorbed in the atmosphere, 29% is reflected back into space. Source. Now, because the Earth is in largely in a stable equilibrium where energy in roughly equals energy out, the Earth radiates about the equivalent of 71% of that 5.6*10^24 joules per year that the sun shines on it, the other 29% being reflected. This will be obvious to some but I'll mention it anyway. Global warming has nothing to do with the sun giving the Earth more energy. It has to do with the Earth radiating less energy into space, at least until the Earth warms enough for a new equilibrium to re-stabilize the energy in = energy out. Raising the concentration of greenhouse gas changes the equilibrium of heat transfer. It's the same principal as putting on a sweater. Using the same link as above, 59 of that 71% radiates from Earth's upper atmosphere and the remaining 12% from the surface. For greenhouse gas driven climate change to work, the only way that can work is that the 59% needs to drop (OK, not the only way, you can also play with albedo). But heat is trapped in the lower atmosphere, the upper atmosphere cools and the 59% drops a little lower. Cloud cover and changes in Albedo such as snow cover, ocean cover and green vs desert are factors too, (the 29% mentioned above), but that gets enormously complicated, and beyond the scope of anything I can try to explain, so I'm going to ignore that for now and just look at the 59% of the 5.6*10^24 joules per year. Thermal radiation increases at roughly the 4th power of the temperature, so if we use the average temperature on Earth at about 288 Kelvin and add 2 degrees to that, the radiation difference between 288 Kelvin and 290 Kelvin using the 4th power rule is a 2.8% increase, or an increase from 12% to 12.34% of the 5.6*10^24. To keep the energy balance consistent, when a new equilibrium is reached, the 59% drops to 58.66% with 0.34% being "new heat" due to the additional greenhouse gas. This change presumably has already happened. In fact, today, the heat balance is out of equilibrium which is why the Earth is warming. The Earth is taking in more heat than it's giving back into space. 0.34% of 5.6*10^24 = 1.9*10^22 joules. By comparison, the combined energy use of all man-kind is about 1/40th of that, or about 5*10^20th Joules. Source. So, from a human perspective it's an enormous amount of energy but to the something the size of the Earth it's quite small. Needless to say, the 0.34% estimate is pretty rough, so take the numbers below with some flexibility, but they're also, at least somewhat in the range. Second, we have to consider where the heat is going. By most estimates, more than 90% of this goes into the oceans and about 90% or a bit more of the heat is going into the oceans with some melting ice, some going into the ground and melting tundra and only a small percentage going into the atmosphere where surface temperatures are calculated. Source, Source and Source (The first mentions a very specific 93.4% into the oceans and 2.3 into the Atmosphere. The last 2 mention "more than 90%" and "about 90%", so there might be some uncertainty on the precise ratio and I'm going to round up to 3%. Feel free to re-run the numbers with 2.3%, 4%, whatever you like. 3% of 1.9*10^22 = 5.8*10^20 (not a typo, it's actually 1.93) So the atmosphere, by rough estimates, adds about 5.8*10^20 joules of energy as a result of the increase in CO2. So, to estimate the expected warming from that amount of energy: The mass of the Atmosphere is about 5.1*10^21 grams. Source. About 4.2 joules can heat 1 gram of water 1 degree C. Source, and the specific heat of the atmosphere is about 1/4.1 that of water, Source. Of ocean water, slightly lower, I'm going to estimate 1/4.0 so, doing the maths: (4.0/4.2)*(5.1*10^21/5.8*10^20), my roughest of calculations says that we'd need about 9 years of trapped heat to warm the atmosphere 1 degree C. If we use skeptical sciences 2.3% number, that ups it to about 11.5 years, and both estimates are obviously too aggressive. The observed surface temperature warming is closer to 1 degree every 40-50 years, give or take, though the warming on land is faster than the warming over water. But my estimate can't help but be quite rough. It excludes albedo and cloud formation entirely, which is important, but trying to calculate is hugely complex and far above my pay-grade. It's difficult to calculate the effects of clouds on global warming even with super-computers. Now, obviously ocean currents, dictate varying amounts of heat exchanged between the ocean and the atmosphere, so one year to the next can vary by significantly more than 1/9th of 1 degree, but that's movement of heat, not new heat added to the system. Now if I calculate how long it would take to heat the oceans, and as I understand it, the deep oceans aren't warming, but the surface and sometimes called "mid-oceans" or mid-depth are warming, (articles here and here Using the numbers above, for 1 mile deep using with the estimate of about 33 times the heat going into the oceans than into the atmosphere, reapplying the specific heat of water to atmosphere ratio of 4 to 1 and estimating the mass of 1 mile of ocean water equivalent to about 160 atmospheres, adjusting for 71% of surface cover, it comes to a rough estimate of 124 years for my very rough heat trapping estimate to warm 1 mile of oceans about 1 degree C. I couldn't find any precise warming in the oceans, but 1 degree of warming, 1 mile deep in 124 years sounds roughly in the neighborhood of what the experts expect. (I think). So, long story short, while local temperature can change significantly over different parts of the day, global average temperature isn't nearly so easily changed. On a single day (using numbers above), the Earth gets 71% of 5.6*10^24/365 or about 1.1*10^22 joules, and an amount quite close to that radiates away from the earth every day too. Based on my very rough estimate, the difference between heat the Earth takes in and heat the Earth radiates is about 0.3%. On individual days you might get a fair bit bigger than a 0.3% difference, but there's still not enough heat added by 1 day of sunlight to significantly change the Earth's global average temperature. Now, obviously, the Earth's surface warms measurably under daylight but that's because 48% of the suns energy reaches the surface directly and the heat is localized, and while 1/2 of the Earth's surface warms the other half cools, so it tends to average out. There's insufficient energy in sunlight to make much change to global average temperature over a short period of time. With that in mind, the 2 degrees that the IPCC discusses, which includes ocean heat trapping, is quite significant. It more likely works out to about 3 degrees on land, 1.5 degrees over water, with rising oceans due to both thermal expansion and melting ice. Warmer oceans means bigger hurricanes. It's easy to say "2 degrees won't matter", but the models say it actually might. It's a pretty significant variation. It also takes quite a bit of time for the 40% increase in CO2 to create that much warming, which is why the projections of 2 degrees warming go out to about 2100. Another way to point out lack of global temperature variation is to look at the charts for global average temperature. while, I couldn't find any charts for daily variation of average global temperatures, I found some monthly variation charts here. Source. Assuming the monthly averages have gotten more accurate in recent decades, The average global temperature change month to month is about 0.13 degrees C over land and about 0.095 degrees C over oceans since 1980, with the largest month to month variation about 0.47 degrees C over land 0.36 over oceans. There's probably some rounding errors in there, but there's clearly a degree of consistency to global average surface temperature and even more consistancy to surface temperature over the oceans, and that's exactly what we should expect, having looked at the heat in and heat out. Local affects are driven by circulation, but circulation is simply the moving of heat from one place to another. Circulation isn't the creation of heat but the behavior of heat and differences in air pressures and it doesn't measurably add any heat to the system. Corrections to my too long answer welcome. 

Background First off, there's every reason to think that bacteria already did oxidative phosporylation before there was any free oxygen. It does not require free oxygen, it requires an electron acceptor. O2 provides the most energy, but many other reactants provide some energy, and the bacterial kingdom uses a bewildering variety of them. To use a different electron acceptor requires only one different enzyme -- the rest of the pathway can be the same. So before there was free oxygen, prokaryotes did arbitrage -- they evolved to use the best electron donor/electron acceptor pair they could find under whatever conditions they faced at the moment. And everything they used for that had to be created in a cycle. Anything which they used up that was not replaced, would quickly be gone. Before there was free oxygen, photosynthesis still got done. Some bacteria used H2S as an electron donor, creating S which could later be reduced for energy. Some created H2. Some could reduce CO2 so that they could use the carbon and oxygen to make structures they needed. Some could not, but could still get energy from light. One way to do that was almost the same as oxidative phosphorylation, it used the absorbed light energy for electron transport instead of using redox energy, in practically the same pathway. Cycles. Every reaction must be undone, or its products will increase to the point that the reaction gets very slow. The exception is products that change state. A solid or gas product won't inhibit the reaction much. So, a bewildering variety of electron donors and acceptors. Photosynthesis creates energetic pairs of molecules or ions. Then redox creates less-energetic pairs of molecules or ions. What was it that was bound to oxygen in the old days, that was not bound later? 

It's difficult but not impossible to model the Earth, Moon and Sun, but the scale is a bit tricky to get right if you try to build or draw it. If we call the Moon's diameter = 1 moon unit, then, Earth's diameter is about 4 moon units. Distance between Earth and Moon, about 110 units, Sun's diameter, about 400 units, and the big one, the Sun's distance to the earth, about 43,000 moon diameter units. So if the Moon is big enough to see, but still very small, say 1 mm, then the sun needs to be 40 cm in diameter (about 33% larger than a basketball) and 43 meters away. 

Heavy metals + sulfur. Maybe there was a lot of iron and nickel etc dissolved in the ancient ocean, along with a lot of sulfur. Iron sulfate is fairly soluble at room temperature, nearly 300 grams/liter. Provided it is not alkaline. But iron sulfide is not soluble. Lots of other heavy metals behave similarly. 

Hydrogen. One form of photosynthesis creates H2. Maybe, at some times a whole lot of H2 was created which was lost to space. Just as much O and less H leaves room for O2 left over. Sulfur. Maybe most of the sulfur in the oceans was stored as SO3.
