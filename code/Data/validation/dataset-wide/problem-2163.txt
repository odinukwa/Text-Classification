So we have a situation where the customer wants an update but the vendor doesn't want to do it, and asking politely hasn't worked. Yelling at tier 1 won't accomplish anything. You need to convince the company that they want to do it. How you do that depends on how much contract muscle you have with them. If your service contract entitles you to this kind of service, then wave it at them. Begin with "This call is being recorded." Yes, they are likely recording their end but this puts the agent on notice that you have a copy too. Get someone to formally decline to make the change, then tell them your company's lawyers will be in touch and they might want to get the going-to-court suit cleaned. I once made a government agency go away, permanently, with this technique. Send recordings of the calls to your boss. If you do not have any contract leverage, you have to make them want to push out an update. Since your boss said "any means necessary", get everyone else in the company to call the vendor's support desk and complain about the bug. Then call again. This will involve a lot of waiting on hold but that's what speaker phones are for. And don't worry about putting their agent on hold while you take your own calls. Remember who's paying whom here, and remind the vendor of that as well. Frequently, as they have apparently forgotten. The winner here will be the one with the greater phone resources and/or patience. Make sure everyone tracks their time and send a frequent report to your boss. I have generally found that being rather firm with T1 support, followed by "I would be happy to take this up with your supervisor / T2" results in a quick transfer to the next level up, but I do not accept voicemail. Their boss is paid more to handle these things, so they can handle it. If the vendor's office is in the same city, pay them a visit (remember, Boss said "any means necessary"). The next step, open warfare, depends heavily on which country you and the vendor are in. Get your boss to approve a budget and schedule in advance. 

That's quite a sense of entitlement. Unless your boss agreed to pay you $15 / hour and withheld $7 for questionable reasons you get nothing "back" as it was not yours to begin with. Your employer offered you a job at a certain rate, you accepted. That this rate was below market is your failure for not researching what that job normally paid for a person with your qualifications. Again, you don't compare yourself to a trained chocolatier, you would be looking at the entry-level zero-experience wage, and I'll bet that's right around the minimum you received. 

There are two possibilities here: a) this is how the office works on a daily basis b) it's a subtle test to see how well you handle interruptions Either way, if you want the job your only option is take it in stride. If you don't work well that way maybe now is a good time to withdraw your application. When I first read the question I thought it was the interviewER not liking the interruptions. If you make it to the HR department your options can then extend to a sign on the door and "GTFO" to anyone who doesn't read it. Pointing weapons at the intruder is, unfortunately, usually discouraged in today's workplace. 

I work as a Data Analyst for my current company and have been tasked with a lot of development work as of late. Most recent was a request for me to build a dynamic QA web app for the entire company (Call Centers, 1700 employees, ~65 clients). The requirements are: 

Is this a battle I shouldn't even try fighting? If not, what should I do to deal with this? Should I go out and buy business-casual wear, be hot and uncomfortable, just to sit where no one sees me and program? I would rather be comfortable and focus on my work, than be uncomfortable and focus on when I can get home and become comfortable. I don't have the social elegance or manipulation skills that my boss has, and am unable to effectively communicate with her on points she is set on. How can I effectively communicate the reasoning of why I should be able to wear whatever I find comfortable within company clothing policy? 

To start, I work as a Data Analyst/Web Developer in a callcenter. I sit in the corner of the building, on the call center floor. Company culture and policy describes a very lax dress code, where wearing casual and comfortable clothes is actively encouraged over more formal wear. My superiors and coworkers often wear street clothes to work, a few of them regularly wear shorts as the building can get a bit hot sometimes due to a lack of thermostat control. My new boss, a lady late in her career, who has been very motivational and helpful. Told our new team that she expects us to properly present ourselves. Which means no casual clothing, we need to wear pants and a collared shirt. The reason is that we will periodically be in meetings with company executives and other high-level leadership, that she expects her team to stand out and be presentable. During this meeting, I said that I would be more than willing to wear business casual clothing when in the executive offices or when attending scheduled meetings with executives. But that I get hot easily in the company buildings, and would much rather work while comfortable than not. She effectively shot me down and the meeting ended. Today, we had a 1x1, and she said that she considered my comment on her clothing policy insubordination, that I was being selfish, and need to stop thinking about just my own wants. Along with how I'm being selfish to ask for a double-wide desk because I can't fit my work equipment on the 2.5ft wide cubicle I currently am at... I was unable to eloquently describe why I don't want to wear business casual clothing while sitting in a back corner programming all day, she was very effective at turning what I was saying back around at me. In the end I almost felt like a petulant child with how I was being treated. 

The management where I work almost completely turned over 1.5 months ago. My new boss (let's call him John) came in, and I walked him through our tools, processes, and reports. I also provided with with a documentation sheet that covers every tool, report, and data dump we have and how they are used. Fast forward a week, John pushes for a new process that directly conflicts with an existing tool, process, and report (all documented and previously described). Reinventing the wheel, and in such a way that it's less productive than it was before. Myself and several other affected brought this up and our concerns were discarded for the reason that he knows what he is doing. The next week, the same thing happens again, except on a much larger scale. Breaking several working tools and processes, increasing the time it takes to record, view, and retrieve certain information on the floor by nearly ten fold. We approached him again, received the same response, that he knows what he is doing, that he has done this before and it works. I was later confronted by him, asking why I am going off and making these things without permission. Why I am creating conflicting tools or processes. I explained that these have existed for almost a year now, and have been constantly evolving to be as efficient as possible. John asked for documentation that I was told to create these tools and processes, documentation that they were needed. I could not provide this as my previous (4) bosses essentially gave me the reigns to go about process improvement as needed. I was transferred to a new boss (Let's call her Jane) a couple weeks ago, a new hire that is to be the Director of Client Analytics. The best way to describe my experience is that I was put on a leash. Any time I would mention an idea, provide input or feedback to a process, or spend some time learning something new to increase my productivity I was met with what equates to a tug on my leash. Told that I need to not worry about that, that I just need to focus on the task at hand (there is no work to do right now, I'm browsing stackoverflow all day), that I need to take things one step at a time and not worry about the big picture. I was recently told by Jane, that she was informed that I go off and create things without guidance, permission, or planning, and without analyzing the need of the tool or process. That I am not focused on what needs to be done. The thing is though, I have not created a single tool, process, or report since any of the new management started. I have just been maintaining what we have. Previously, I was given free reign to do what needed to be done to improve productivity and meet the business needs, which I did, and completely automated. 

If you have some creative skills which enable you to produce new and valuable things, you have a wonderful opportunity to list them on your resume/CV, or even display them. It is much easier to prove you have creative skills than to say you are generally creative. Whether a recruiter or hiring manager thinks you are have general creative ability is up to how much they read into your presentation of your creative skills. jmac's example of Chris Spurlock's resume is a perfect example of how you can prove you have creative skills. If your creative skills are in the scope of or symbiotic with the type of work you are seeking, then you absolutely should use your resume/CV as an opportunity to prove this. Spurlock's resume proved his ability to create attractive graphical material, as well as competency with the web; both of these were directly related to his desired work. Using myself as any example: I am by no means an artist (I am a software developer by trade), but I feel that I have an eye for good graphical presentation, and I can use some Adobe products, such as InDesign, with competency. Thus, I made my resume in InDesign and included some (basic) graphics to guide the eyes to the main sections of my resume. The atypical layout I used has caught some eyes which I really hoped would notice my resume; plus, when I list Photoshop and InDesign as supplementary skills, I have already provided some evidence of that. Whether or not a recruiter reads into the relative uniqueness of my resume as indicating that I am "creative" is moot, since it really does depend on the person reading the resume. 

"Other people break the rules!" is not a valid excuse for breaking the rules, unfair as it seems. Just get in the queue. And get in there early, so you never have to worry about not fitting in the bus. Oh, and you probably should report the incident, as well as make a request that the company do something about the fact that the bus does not have enough capacity for everyone. 

I've often heard it recommended that you dress one "level" above what you would wear to work. When you are not given instructions on what to wear, you can follow this. The goal is to give the impression that you are taking the interview seriously and you are well-kept and professional, but you also fit into the "culture." This helps the interviewer(s) feel comfortable. I'll just give some blanket suggestions on a few examples, but it's up to you to decide based on your best judgment and personal style. 

This is setting off alarms in my head. Should I respond? What should I say? I realize that I am likely blacklisted, but if my response could determine whether or not that would be the case, I'd like to avoid it, obviously; even then, I'd like to be as kind and professional as possible. 

Ok, I would suggest you get to know and trust these 11 very well. Once you do that, ask them what they would like to see changed about their workplace, their responsibilities, etc. Ask them for feedback on your performance as manager as well. I firmly believe that "management is not your friend" but managers and employees have a symbiotic relationship and should be motivated to help each other out. Earning your subordinates' trust will help you reach that goal. Once you are doing that with your immediate subordinates, you'll probably be able to get them to do that with theirs, and so on down the chain of command. It'll take time, but it's your absolute best bet for addressing the problem of demotivation over time. Hell, just feeling like management cares about you is a motivator for lots of people. 

Good to note: This company has very low average wages, and is in the U.S. TL:DR: New project that I'm being put under a lot of pressure to do. I'm asked to perform full-stack developer duties as a low-paid data analyst. I feel abused at my current benefit level with the stress I'm under. It's not acceptable to ask about wage increases at this company, I need a way to effectively negotiate for a merit increase. 

Asking about pay at this company is usually considered a faux-pas, how can I ask for a wage increase, and make an effective case? I don't think it's fair to be put under so much pressure to develop this stuff when I'm not even considered a developer and am getting the pay of a floor supervisor with much more responsibilities, stress, and skill requirements. I don't expect to meet avg. junior developer wages here, but having the ability to not constantly worry about my financial stability on top of my work stress would be nice. 

I work as a Data Analyst & Developer at a call center. TL:DR: New boss did not pay attention to existing tools or processes, went off and pushed new processes that replaced existing ones, in an inefficient manner without communicating the need for those changes to the floor or myself (who implemented the existing processes and tools). I was transferred to a new hire, a director, and was immediately put on a leash, and treated as if I've just been wasting company time going off and doing my own thing. Later being told that she (new boss) was told I have an issue with going off and doing random stuff without permission, need, or planning. However, I have not created a single new tool or process since any of the new management has been hired. How can I deal with this? 

Short historical summary: I've been programming at my current job for ~ 10 months now, I've setup QA, scheduling, adherence tracking, roster, and data pulling/warehousing/reporting for anything else that we needed in a callcenter environment. However, I've always been a "Team Lead" by title, while my superiors expect me to perform programming/data analyst duties. I will even get regular requests pull data from a new vendor and generate reports, or to add features to some tools to meet the needs of a different group. I was even offered the position, which was then rescinded due to it not being in the budget. This came with the difficulties of getting access to tools/data/sites that I need, which often required intervention from my boss's boss as I was just a Team Lead to anyone that I had not met before. For me this was a means to an end and I need to experience so I've went along with it. Meat of the issue: Recently, more and more sites have been blocked due to the restrictive firewall any call center would be expected to have. I've put in tickets to unblock necessary sites that house documentation on the tools/languages I am using. All of my tickets were recently denied. The majority of documentation for the tools and languages I am using as well as other resources such as stackoverflow have been blocked by the firewall. The decision was handed down by individuals very much disconnected from the program, or from the problems I run into when I cannot access developer documentation. The reason I recieved from them was: "This is not quite the direction that we want from your role within the program". I feel like I'm fighting to do the job I'm simultaneously expected to do. My work greatly benefits the colleagues, supervisors, and program managers in my center. It does very little for high-level management outside of the center as it's hard to quantify money saved through less wasted time on a monthly or quarterly report. How can I move forward with this? Do I continue fighting harder and harder to keep things running, or just stop and let it fall apart and hope for the best? I'm still getting requests for features, changes, and new reports from people who us them. Edit: I want to clarify: I don't think I'm 'hot stuff', I just landed into a company that has no internal toolings of any sort (~1500 employees). I was in an ideal position to start developing, a thousand problems to solve and the freedom to pick and choose and do anything I could to solve them.
