As is typical of "Answers in Genesis" they don't seem to even have a basic understanding of what they are talking about. They are confusing how gases normally behave in common experience (i.e. on scales of human experience). When dealing with a nebula, we are talking structures that expand for light years in all directions... Read that again: light year*s*! Over such great distances, even the most diffuse material will have enormous gravitational attraction. Because there is a whole lot of mass there (for instance, the Orion Nebula has a mass over 2000 times that of our sun). For the sake of your sanity, as soon as someone uses Answers in Genesis or Conservapedia as a source, just walk away. They are notoriously biased. As for the process itself, and to explain it properly, one must first admit that there are still many questions that are not yet answered. However, we still have a fairly good idea how it works (and not knowing parts of how something happened does in no way invalidate a sound theory). Harvard takes a rather humerous and simple approach in explaining it: 

So while our cat was acting "crazy" this evening tearing from room to room and pouncing on on nothing, my wife and I were laughing at its behaviour. During discussions she mentioned hearing that cats have a chemical in their brains that acts much like LSD. Sure enough, someone on the Snopes forum asked the same question (the thread relates other humorous cat stories but no answer). So, do cats (normally) have any chemicals in their brains that causes them to "hallucinate"? (or cause this rather erratic behaviour) 

This site (which I can't say much about) also repeats this study without actually linking to it or referencing it properly: 

Full disclosure, I have not seen this film. Like so many other instances in real life, perhaps it's a bit of both. And keep in mind, proof is generally limited to mathematics. An LA Times investigative reporter dug into this a bit, and found a few details that support Thierry Guetta's biography. He is indeed a real individual, and he was born in France, moved to the US, and is involved in the art scene. There is evidence that he was displaying his video work, with the 2006 posting of LIFE REMOTE CONTROL. However, keep in mind that a director could "embellish" aspects of a person's life if they were motivated to highlight a parody on the art scene. 

There is some indication though that cleaning too much may impact your well being, not in the way you posited in your question, but rather through reactions to all the cleaning agents. 

While not totally relevant, it is none the less interesting, scientists have performed mathematical studies of beer bubbles (and who wouldn't want to assist in that research?). As one of the most common beverages, we do spend a lot of time studying it. A subject I endorse. 

If you peruse the two blog posts (I know, not the most reliable sources), they do a lot of research for us. They link to the original photographs from google and highlight how the photoshop was done. 

(This comes from the CD by Elly Nieman, Circus Princes) And I'm sure that you could find more on any trip to the grocery store. I just picked up a can of beans from the cupboard that didn't have a single 6 in it! Even though the question was about the claim of 666 in barcodes, if you are interested in the history of barcodes and how they work, you can check out this "How stuff works" article. This webpage states that The UCC (formerly The Uniform Product Code Council, Inc.) is responsible for issuing product numbers, specification, etc. If you are interested in barcodes and their development, this page has a link to a PDF paper on the subject. 

As for the method of preservation, that varies widely by country, and even region. Some areas only use a wax which is safe according to the FDA (although may feel and taste gross if you eat it). As their web page indicates 

The major difficulty in actually examining this substance is that no one will allow a vial to be opened to perform an exam, so only observations through the glass can be made. In 2005, the Italian Committee for the Investigation of the Paranormal has gone on to look into the issues more. 

So, from this unverified "study", it would seem that the rates for celebrities is indeed higher than the general population. The only reason I even decided to answer this was because of a blog post by a blog I am following that popped up today. In that post, they mention a group called the Barna group doing a study on US divorce rates, and they seem a bit lower than 50%, but that was from 1999. Even so, a website dedicated to divorce rates also seems to back up a rate at less than 50%. The CDC tracks it a bit differently, by giving it a stat like: Marriage rate: 6.8 per 1,000 total population, and Divorce rate: 3.4 per 1,000 population. In this case, it seems that the 50% number holds up. (Although the marriage and divorce rate is different than the rate claimed in the first article, so that would cause me to question that article a bit more.) BOTTOM LINE: Yes, it appears that celebrities do have a higher divorce rate than the average person (dependent on how you define celebrity of course). 

Again, ignoring the problem of the historicalness of the exodus... it is squarely in the Bronze Age. If you don't want to accept what theologians who accept the default position of the bible as the ground truth, this page from the University of Minnesota gives the following dates for supposed authorship (again, note that this is when the books were authored, not the time-frame of the sorties they are telling): 

Now, there is the claim there are no parts. The video by Mike Wilson shows photographs of numerous parts, so that is plainly an outright lie of omission. The photograph that truthers display as an "example" is from a long distance, and does not show the entire site either. Here are four pictures that DO show aircraft debris: 

So note that in this emotionally charged issue, people will tend to hyperbole and appeals to emotion in an attempt to shore up their argument over the other viewpoint. As even the University of Michigan states, those positions are misleading. Although it is notable that the generation of adult stem cells was motivated by a scientist with religious reasons for doing so, and overall, I find that his accomplishment is commendable. 

Well, the fundamental flaw in the entire premise is an understanding of the word "chance" as well as what scientists have done in the field of abiogenesis... The entire "answers in genesis" argument is a strawman (amongst many other logical fallacies), so I really don't think it's worth addressing. However, abiogenesis itself is a NEW and exciting field of study. Several strides have been made in that field, but we're in the same stage of understanding as we were on evolution prior to the discovery and understanding of DNA. Also, there is the constant confusion of abiogenesis and evolution that creationists conflate. Again, it's a strawman and disingenuous at best. For instance, in 2010, Dr. Craig Venter actually used a bacterial shell and wrote DNA for it. 

Well, a PHOBIA could be considered a mental disorder. Does he really have a phobia, or is he borderline? The impact to his life is possibly more than just having clean surfaces in his house. How much time does he spend dealing with cleaning? Does it affect his ability to socialize? Does it affect his ability to perform a job by which he can support himself? etc.? As to your question about infections and such, that is known as the hygiene hypothesis (WP). However, that is mostly associated with childhood immunities and allergies as opposed to the effects on adults. 

That said, one can find numerous barcodes that do not contain enough digits to make either number of the beast, but then you can make any other numerology number out of them. Here is one that dismisses that urban legend: 

So it is efficient in stopping germ grown and constricting the skin to stop bleeding. Generally, after shaving, most men want some sort of relief from "razor burn" after shaving. This is generally caused by the removal of skin along with the hair. Potassium Alum is a type of salt. So throwing this on your face will probably make you forget about the razor burn, and concentrate on the salt burn that your raw skin is now enduring. Of course, this is the same mechanism that many alcohol based after shaves will use (although the mechanisms for providing relief are different). Alcohol evaporates quickly, causing the surface of the skin to feel cool. Potassium alum tightens the skin as a dehydrating effect of the salt, and gives a refreshing feeling in that manner. Again, it's more meant as an astringent and styptic though. 

The limitation being that the teens should have no sexual experience at all (to what degree is not defined clearly in the article). This study is only one out of many, so many parameters are still unknown at this time. It may have been a fluke, a good report, or even a fraud. Only time will tell in this politically motivated and charged climate. The prevailing evidence though indicates that it is highly ineffective in all ways. 

These numbers are higher than the percentages given in the general US population (which have been reported as anywhere from 3% to 15% depending on who you ask. Lies, damn lies, and statistics...). I am attempting to locate another study which did a more thurough breakdown of specific fields of study and belief in god, whoever I am unable to locate it at the moment. The basic conclusion from that study was that mathematicians were the most likely to believe in a god, followed by engineers, and physicists least likely. However, that study is escaping my google-fu. 

I think the biggest thing going on here is confirmation bias as opposed to any other phenomenon. There are thousands and thousands of musicians, and the "27 Club" has only 45 members (as defined by wikipedia, and going back to 1908). I think this particular phenomenon also has some hallmarks of the Birthday Paradox in that people will always have a specific age when they die. Naturally, some will have the same age. (This is a weak analogy, I am thinking of a better one, and am open to suggestions.) I think what really drives people to the confirmation bias inherent in this is that 27 is a rather young age for anyone to die. To have musicians be very famous by that age, makes them stand out even more. As for other people dying at 27, I think that you can list many other groups that have a much higher chance of dying. For instance, in the commercial sector, being a fisherman is the deadliest demographic as far as profession goes. 

This web page provides an experimental set up you can perform on beer foam. One of the conclusions/discussions says 

I think that the wikipedia page wouldn't really dedicate much to a very fringe belief. Already they say: 

Basically all this does is make it harder for you to breathe. Thereby making you train to a certain level of exertion under an already exerted condition (some credence to the endurance claim, but muscular endurance, not aerobic endurance). This in no way simulates high altitude because of the pressure. The lower air pressure is a result of there being less air all around you (not just in the lungs). The effect of this device would be to simulate asthma or some other bronchial restriction, NOT altitude. You are correct, altitude training requires actually living at altitude and acclimating to it. Although, at altitude, a mask like this would possibly give the strengthening claim some additional benefit. A researcher at Columbia University says: 

But then you look at overall country happiness, and very secular, irreligious nations like the Scandinavian nations are rated as the happiest. 

The surprising part was that the temperature rises didn't occur until after the hunt, and were more marked after a successful hunt: 

Bonobos are a prime example of sex for the sake of sex. Also Capuchins. Anyone who has watched the Discovery Channel enough knows about this behavior. 

Southern Methodist University also lists this as a hoax, with three links to detailed stories about it (one of the links being the TalkOrigins site). Even this admittedly evangelical and religious site doubts these claims. 

Basically, there is a long tradition of celebrating mothers. Which seems natural given what we know of anthropology and human nature. The article goes on further to talk about the American origins and history of the holiday (which seems to be the main idea you are driving at): 

This baptist news site also is doubtful, and severely critique one of the discoverers. All in all, it is one of the same types of things that is always on the verge of discovery, yet never actually turns up. 

This link is from the Committee of Skeptical Inquiry that did a relatively in-depth investigation of John Edward's claims. AGAIN you see that he is using well known techniques... And this references a well known expose done on Dateline that showed how pathetic John Edwards's attempts really are. 

Absolutely! ALL organisms are evolved from the same original organism (that is what common descent means). I just finished reading Greatest Show on Earth, which addresses most points one by one. Remember, in a field as complex as biology, there will never be a singular item one can point to and say, "See, because of X, it's all true." I also recommend Why Evolution is True as reading material. Talk Origins also has an extensive discussion on The Molecular Sequence Evidence (i.e. genes, RNA, etc.). It even speaks of falsifiability in the article (a hallmark of real science). Further points to consider regarding evolution. 

Too many people are attempting to equate this to the Pons/Fleischmann experiment, which was thoroughly debunked. There is still legitimate research to do, such as Dr. David Koltick at Purdue. However, the claims are vastly different than the Pons/Fleischmann claims.
