I don't actually ski or crosscountry but I spend lot of time mountaineering with friends that do. Packs with ski straps are for sure the way to go. Once I got asked to help someone with strap skis to her pack as she didn't have a pack with straps. I used a pair of those. I used them to strap my crossbow to my pack when hunting and a few other things. They come in various widths and lengths. I own a few myself and have used to strap my crossbow as said, ropes, tents, flyes and ground sheets and I'm sure more creative people could come up with other ideas. :) SeaToSummit Straps with hooks 

They are called rock cairns and are used to mark tracks. Various tracks around the world use them in place where the track might not be so clear or easy to follow. In some other places, it's just tourists being tourists. Ben Nevis in Scotland has a few cairns to mark the track close to the top where it might have snow some times of the year and the track is not so visible. Also in Scotland, there is a road with lots of cairns everywhere like the pic above. 

I haven't seen the Bearpaw one but I own a couple of jigs and on both, the clamp is attached by a magnetic bit and I can swap clamps without problems. In addition of changing clamps, both jigs have a couple of screws/bolts where the clamp is attached so you can adjust the offset. I've seen same features in all other similar jigs I've come across so I truly believe you should be able to just change the clamp with no problems specially with the "deluxe" bit in the name. :) Furthermore, I shoot compound for target and barebow recurve for field and hunting so I fletch my arrows straight for target and right helical for field/hunting. I only have a right helical clamp and use it to get my fletching straight for target adjust the offset on the jig to compensate the helical. You should also be able to do it too. :) 

I know that some animals find hard to see red and they can't differentiate between red and green very well so I'd assume green and red have the same application (used in dark places) with red being a better option. Ultraviolet light is used for forensic applications but it's a specific blue light not just a light that is blue so I'd also assume that the blue light in your torch is to mock that. 

There are various factors to lead you being above the clouds. Mainly what you want to do is to be on top of a mountain during Thermal inversion. From wikipedia: 

EDIT 2 ----- This answer is based on my experience there. I haven't been there for 4 years now. things might have changed. The problem with wild camping is not because of landmines or population or wildlife. The problem (which I don't actually see as a problem) is that those countries rely on tourists to get some money into the economy therefore wherever can be accessed by people has been transformed into a "business" in a way that you would need to organize with someone to take you there. 

One shooting the other basically. It's a safety measure. Where I live we don't have hunting season. We hunt the whole year round. I'm a bow-hunter and I've encounter myself looking up the barrel of a rifle twice. 

I think you have already answered. Check for clear sky or how the overall weather feels like. A barometer could give you a brief indication as well. Ideally, you have left home with an idea of the forecast. We have a service of mountain radios here in my part of the world where you can hire some radios and they do a daily broadcast of weather forecast and you can check in to let them know you and your party is OK. When we do our mountaineering here, we always hire one of those radios so we can get weather forecasts and plan accordingly as weather here changes often and some times from a calm day to a bloody blizzard. 

Artificial vanes are heaps more durable than feathers and being artificial, they are weather resistant. One of the things I most see in the field on a wet day is long bowers covering arrows with a plastic bag because they won't fly well if feathers get wet. 

Boots take a little while to break in. My La Sportiva Makalus is a full leather mountaineering boots and took years to break in. In our mountaineering group, we had another 3 guys using Makalus and we would always finish a trip with busted feet. Some other boots I have for other activities don't take as long. It usually takes half a dozen trips to break in. As your friend is the store owner and is happy to replace your boots, you could ask him if you could keep the boots for another couple of trips and see if they get better. Maybe try to use them for a few days (at home, to the supermarket, everywhere) and see if they break in nicely. If they do, then you could exchange for a new pair and go through the process again. Another tip may be useful is to use a sock liner. That would help avoiding blister. What I usually do is to use a thin sock with a very thick on top. As a matter of reference, below is the gear I use for my activities. La Sportiva Makalu Lowa Z-8s GTX Vasques ST Elias GTX Bridgedale Summit socks (the thick pair) Bridgedale Coolmax Liner (the thin pair) 

To choose a good set, you first need to understand the behind the specs. Usually, binos are referred by two numbers, A x B The number (A) before the x is the magnification factor, i.e how many times closer (larger) you see the object. The number after the x (B) is the diameter of the lenses in millimeters. Then, there is a third number that's the result dividing B by A with results the pupil exit in millimeters. That is the "amount" of light that comes in to your eyes. So, putting those number in place we have... 

Turnaround time will be driven by the time you want to be back to your origin/campsite. You will also need an idea how long the walk itself is going to take. That's quite important and more precise the better. You don't want underestimate and get caught in a night walk in serious mountaineering. Trust me. I've been there. There are various factors you need to consider to get to this time. 

From your three options, a Dedicated GPS unit is going to be your best bet. Smart Phones barely last a day. If you're out of coverage, the phone will keep searching for network and battery will die as quick as a cat fight. Of course you can use the airplane mode but we all know how long they last. GPS watches do last a long time. It will vary a bit from brand/model to brand/model. I picked randomly 4 Garmin ones and I got from 

Aiders are the key differentiator between aid climbing and free climbing. When free climbing, the gear is just for protection. In aid climbing, you place protection, clip an aider to it, walk up the aider, reach up and place another piece of protection, repeat. Key points are length and number of steps, types, comfort and easy to use for the type of climb you’re doing. I think the key point is the length as I’d hae to get half way up and discover that my bulk Aider is catching everywhere and disturbing my climb. If you are doing a wall with lots of free climbing, you want a shorter aider that will be less bulky when clipped to the side of your harness. If you are doing an aid-intensive route, you want a longer aider that will give you more bounce-testing options. You can find further details here 

Hunting arrows fly differently due to the broadheads so the "fineTuning" variable would be slightly different. I shoot the same bow and arrows (points and broadheads weight the same) for field and hunting but I have a set of arrows for field and a set for hunting. That said, as I shoot a recurve barebow style, I wouldn't notice much difference between my two sets. I only have two sets to so it makes easier to pack when I'm going to the field or hunting. :) 

So you could make usage of a full on all features on for to long. A dedicated GPS unit / handheld device picking 4 randomly similar low, mid and top range, all work on AA batteries and last for 25 hours (besides the top range that comes with a removable, rechargeable lithium-ion battery pack and last for 14 hours.) But even lasting less than the watches you can easily carry another few batteries. Lasting 25 hours, you could easily have it on for a your whole walk (8 hour / day) for 3 days. I believe the trend is to build a device to suit a specific need. The watches are good for short trips running while GPS devices are more long trips. As a side note. I bought one of those portable solar panels (Go Zero, I don't remember the model) to try to recharge things. I think it was a waste of money. On a long hunting trip (a week) I tried to use it and it was cloudy most of the days. I tried to charge a couple of batteries without success. IMO as biggest and greatest the techs are nowadays I would only trust on batteries for my head-torches and electronic devices :)
