For years, certain classic retinal indicators have been considered absolute evidence of shaken baby syndrome. Doctors have made explicit statements that other activities like falls can't cause similar injuries (with a typical "well given infinite time" hedge). other source Is it proven that the severe retinal haemorrhages can only be attributed to SBS? 

However all of my other readings indicate that soap alone will not drown a bird (although oil will). The relation of the uropygial gland and flotation is not definitive and there are also other mechanisms which make ducks float, including hollow bones, feather structure, and lung air retention. It's very unlikely that a little soap on the water would make one sink. For instance, diving is accomplished by quick variations to plume density and exhalation from the lungs, not adjustment of the oil concentration on the feathers. Indeed, oil is more likely to drown a duck than soap, as oil does not create the same plumed air pockets, thus destroying bouyancy. Also, while soap won't drown a bird, it is quite likely to cause hypothermia since more water will touch the skin. 

Now, if I read it correctly (entirely possible that I did not), then the velopharyngeal closure is a complicated way of saying "mouth". So getting something in there will affect your ability to scream. Now the second part, can you get something in there not easily dislodge with a tongue? Hopefully this is easily enough observed that I won't get hit for references. If you open your mouth as wide as you can, you will observe that you can still pull it open more with your fingers (though it hurts) and when you release it will return to the prior gap. So yes, you can cram enough in there such that your tongue cannot deliver enough force to dislodge, though a sock may not be enough. 

The American Cancer Society makes the claim that stopping with drugs is significantly more effective than without. They also list several drugs which have been shown to help quitting. They don't do a very good job of revealing where their data comes from, but I'll check more. 

This question would have been asked differently of different respondents. Those who were not prompted would have been implying the ending, which may not well align with the prompted ending. Again, they have been successful in many ways (ending the state of emergency, asylum for political dissedents, the creation of the Free Syrian army, so it would depend on how the respondent filled in the blank left by the absent prompt. The difference in "No"s with FOX watchers primarily shifted to "Don't Know", not to yes, implying not misinformation but rather lack of information (or undecided, or perhaps confused with this bad question). Notably, MSNBC from the other end of the political spectrum, which the paper praises, had a similar response -- again indicating that the problem may be with the question, not the respondents. In addition, with timing, this survey was taken right after the Arab League announced a two week deadline on sanctions. This is not an insignificant fact, as it would have affected again the respondents view of "success". 

According to this site, which uses a community effort to rank movies, 50% of all movies pass the test, and only 10% fail on all three points. So no a strong majority does not fail the test. However the validity of the measure at all is questioned, for instance tvtropes 

It's going to be very hard to prove to any single individual that something like that doesn't work -- due to the Placebo effect. He may very well be experiencing a benefit from the magnets. He'd also be quite right to say they work for him and not others, since the effect is entirely in his own psychology. If he won't respond to evidence (research studies, etc.) then there is little you can do to convince him, but I'll look for some papers on it for you. 

It's up to you to draw a conclusion, but I do not logically see how one can hold the position that climate models need to be substantially revised, but this will have no impact on the results .... unless the opinions, I mean results, are predetermined. Also of note here is that CERN isn't saying that it will have a significant effect, or what direction (in regards of supporting AGW) that effect will take. All they are saying is that things need to be substantially revised. Substantial revision = significant implications. What those implications are will not be known until more research is performed. What was thought to be a "known" just became a very large "unknown" and that shakes things up. 

Damaging the rugs does not increase their value per-se. However antiques are worth more, and this is one of many techniques that could be used to forge up an "antique". Old rugs are popular, so anything that can be done to make a rug look older is going to help increase it's sale price. Fake antiques of many kinds often fool even the experts. 

No, they don't just hang out in the water until dead. If you think about it this doesn't make sense from an evolutionary standpoint. A frog evolved in an environment where water heats slowly, not where water is suddenly boiling (boiling water isn't terribly common in nature). $URL$ $URL$ 

And this is why I don't watch CNN. Poor quality video, no effort at validation, etc. etc. There are a lot of reasons to be skeptical of this. For one the skin color and patterning is similar to any number of historical desicated corpses found in bogs, ice, etc. For another, the "body" is something any a half decent special effects artist could produce. The simplest explanation is that it's a hoax. The next best is that perhaps the crash unearthed a preserved body. There's no excuse for this sort of news "story" to even be published. 

Crossing two reference points, I can say the answer to this is almost certainly yes, in Madagascar. Madagascar fertilty rate: 4.72 % of Madagascar women in the workforce: 86% Now while it's certainly possible that the remainig 14% have SO many kids that the 86% in the workforce do not exceed 2.3, it the more reasonable conclusion that Madagascar fits your case. 

It would appear that the only thing the Bechdel test is good at measuring is whether or not something passes the Bechdel test. If it misidentifies mysogenist movies as feminist and vice-versa then it cannot be said to be a valid measure or critique of the industry. 

One paper (the only one I could find in support), does claim that surfactants will change the surface tension and result in drowning. 

The CDC concludes that circumcision does reduce risk of disease based on multiple lab studies and controlled intervention trials, in addition to the statistical research that opponents focus on for "refuting" the evidence. Without addressing any spurious claims about countries' "superior" health care systems, and avoiding the broadband use of wikipedia and pictures to draw emotic correlative arguments on a topic where real research has been done, it boils down to this: Research indicates reduced disease risk for circumcised men. The question to be answered then is, do you feel that less risk of disease is synonymous with higher quality of life? Assuming that the "better sex" one can experience with a foreskin is true, then it becomes an individual question of -- Does better sexual enjoyment provide enough quality of life to counter balance the increased risk? There are some myths about the difficulty or need cleaning, which Medline seems to clear up by saying to wash it like you do everything else. Personally I do not see the difference of three minutes of cleaning either way to be a quality of life concern. 

Here is a good breakdown from a grad student on twin studies. However, the key thing to note reading through it is the re-iterated theme that most research to date has not been of a sufficient sample sizes to be able to claim to represent homosexuality in general. How we define "homosexuality" is also very much up in the air, particularly with prison populations. When do two inmates having sex count as homosexual? As far as we know, from a truly skeptic viewpoint, we just don't know yet what "causes" homosexuality. I will add, as an aside, that this is insanely hard to research. 95% of all pages I get are strongly activist for or against. 

The FAA regulation is based on a study from the RTCA which does indicate that cell phones can interfere with critical systems. Clearly they do not interfere every time, and not every interference would result in a crash, and proof after the fact would be difficult. So the fact that no crashes have been blamed on this is not, by itself, proof that they pose no risk. As to why all devices might be banned, airlines tend to err on the side of less lawsuits and less violations. The regulatory policy is clear that Airlines (in the US) are responsible for the effects of electronic devices operated on their planes, so they are going to be very hesitant to allow usage -- especially since research by the RTCA shows that some devices do interfere. 

Yes, they reported it early. Since when did a news crew screwup become evidence of a multi-national conspiracy? 

Fox news consumers were actually more likely to get this one right, according to the cited paper. The question about Occupy Wallstreet is reasonable and probably OK. In addition to the above problems with the cited poll, consider the following This study found that Fox News watchers were more likely to want entertainment based news stories, again implying that they are differently informed, not "misinformed", and that Fox News viewers are more concerned with topics other than middle eastern revolutions. This study exposes significant issues with using anecdotal self reporting of news exposure due to people drastically overreporting news exposure, meaning that we can't be sure that the people surveyed actually watched any of the news they claimed to. This reveals a significant flaw in the methodology of the poll cited.
