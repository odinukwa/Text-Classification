Partisan politics and stock market performance: The effect of expected government partisanship on stock returns in the 2002 German federal election (FÃ¼ss, Bechtel (2002)) It also depends on the baseline way of measuring impact. A really terrible president might be able to wreck serious damage on the economy while the other branches and electorate would take time to undo that damage and remove him. Should presidential performance be measured against the very worst that an incompetent or malicious person could deliver? Or are they best compared with other likely serious contenders? These papers above are much more measures of the latter than the former. 

By one estimate (here is another) , as a result of WWII, the United Kingdom saw a debt of more than 200 percent of GDP. They never defaulted on their debt after reaching that level. I believe they never did anything radical, just systematically growing government spending more slowly than national income, thus gradually eroding the debt as a fraction of GDP. The paper Sustainability of High Public Debt: What the Historical Record Shows may also be of interest. 

Is anyone aware of a study where health insurance rates would be dependent on body fat? It would, of course, be difficult to define when someone is overweight, but lets say being vastly overweight would increase the rates. After a short search I found this: $URL$ but it studies the effect of insurance on body weight and not the other way around. 

If you're really serious about researching this data, I'd suggest contacting the Real Estate Institution of New Zealand: $URL$ As long as there are reasons to move to Auckland (more work etc.) and the supplied housing is not high enough to match the demand, the prices will continue to rise. This effect is visible in many major cities where the supply of housing is (for some reason like goverment rules or slow building) inelastic. 

I have several economic time series which include stock indices, Federal Funds Rate, Consumer Price Index, Industrial Production Index, money supply and exchange rate. I decided to do the following three things to my data before i perform any analysis: 

To perform seasonality adjustment on the real data using Eviews on all variables except exchange rate and federal funds rate, is this appropriate? For money supply, data i obtained is already seasonality adjusted, meaning that i transform it to real data after it is seasonality adjusted, is this acceptable? 

If I were to adjust stock index for inflation, is that i could do so by dividing the stock index by the CPI (Based on a particular year) of the particular year and then multiply it by 100? But is it appropriate to use the CPI of the country to which the stock exchange belong? For example, if i were to adjust Singapore stock index then im going to use Singapore CPI. But.. is this appropriate? Firstly, anyone living in any country can invest on the index. Secondly, the index constituent companies may originate from different part of the world and applying one country inflation rate on it seems inappropriate. If so, what could be used to adjust the inflation for stock index? Besides..should we actually adjust stock index for inflation? It seems that information will be lost.. Im currently preparing the data for testing the dynamics between stock return and macroeconomic variables. 

I'm guessing the author has split the series between a trend component and noise component, for example with the HP-filter, and studies the smooth trend component. 

You're probably not looking for a complex scientifical discussion on the subject, so here's a very simplified description of the mechanism: Lower interest rate => Loaning money is cheaper => More money in the system => Higher inflation. So the change in inflation is one of the products of government/central bank changing interest rates. 

Having your own currency means that you can conduct your own monetary policy. Adopting another country's currency means that you trade your ability to make decisions about your country's quantity of money, inflation target, etc. to a tested and solid mean of payment (the advantages you listed are good reasons). You might consider European countries adopting the euro as an example of countries adopting a single currency. Ecuador adopting the U.S. dollar in 2000 might be a good place to look if you want to see the effect in a specific country. There are quite a few countries in the world which use another country's currency as their official currency. This article lists them all (as of 2014): $URL$ 

The practice of rounding to the smallest currency unit is called Swedish rounding. I know of a few papers that discuss likely economic concequences. Eliminating the Penny from the U. S. Coinage System: An Economic Analysis Lombra (2001) Time to Eliminate the Penny from the U.S. Coinage System: New Evidence Whaples (2007) Pennies, Pricing, and Rounding: Is All the Relevant Analysis in? Lombra (2007) 

The paper Beyond Cobb-Douglas: Estimation of a CES Production Function with Factor Augmenting Technology should be of use here: 

How does he do this? He does this with prices. These may be shadow prices, relative prices without currency (barter), or they might be conventional prices quoted in the numeraire good. Explaining this is probably beyond the scope of a stackexchange article. This review may be of some use but the content in a microeconomics textbook would be similar. So the price of goods are not only not "definitely meaningless" but essential to the planner's activities. However, you do not need currency in an ideal centrally-planned economy. It is possible to write down models with prices but without currency (credit models) or even money (barter models) which nevertheless have central planners that can easily maximize welfare. 

You're comparing rankings in different categories by testing for correlation. This approach says nothing about causality and has a number of other questionable properties. I'd try tackling the question with actual data and regression models. Also, if I understood correctly, you're comparing current annual growth to a measure (education/literacy) which, at least in theory, forms over decades, even centuries. With your data and graphs you might argue that some of the current spending on education is ineffective in generating economic growth, but that's about as far as I'd go. 

If I understood this correctly, you're just looking to draw simple graphs? If you're not willing to create functions in a program like R or similar, I'd suggest a simple solution: the drawing function in Google Drive. Open Google Drive and then open Google Drawings. It is actually pretty good and easy to learn for basic graphs. 

Transform nominal data to Real data Seasonality Adjustment Reindex (Is this necessary?) Take the logarithm of them 

Is the sequence of the above 4 tasks correct? To transform the nominal to real data, below are my ways, can anyone please let me know is my way acceptable/correct? 

I have indicated my understanding and problem on the attached image below. I'm a bit confused on the impact of inflation on stock price. As increase in inflation would cause nominal interest rate to increase and also may cause firms' nominal profit and dividend to increase, does this mean that the nominal stock price will not change due to inflation change? Then it contradicts with with item one in the image? Or does it mean that both are separate view and cannot be combine together? On the other hand, if i consider the decrease in real interest rate, will real stock price decrease or increase? Another question is that, when analyzing the impact of inflation on stock price, or when scholars formulate theory, real stock price or nominal stock price will usually be used for explanation? I would appreciate it if anyone could explain this , or point out to me if there's anything wrong on my analysis. 

I'm not really an expert on the subject, but for welfare reforms I've been suggested to read Grogger and Karoly: "Welfare Reform: Effects of a Decade of Change" (2009) in the past. I believe it tackles at least some of the subjects you're thinking about and might be a good place to start. 

Chiang is probably the best you can find, but you might try Takayama - Mathematical Economics or Simon and Blume - Mathematics for Economists. 

I think @DornerA gave a good answer for reasoning behind the mechanism. For a historical example, look no further than the fiscal crisis and the rapid increase in gold price from 2008-2011. 

Oil is found Oil (manufacturing) sector booms Currency value of the Dutch guilder increases as demand for Dutch guilder increases (to pay for Dutch oil. Can cause/be due to an inflow of foreign currencies) Exports from other sectors become more expensive (due to currency value increase) Other sectors become less competitive.
