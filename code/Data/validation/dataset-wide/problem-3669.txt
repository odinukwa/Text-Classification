I do a lot of salsa and other latin dances which Zumba is based on. Mind you I'll do about 3-4 hours of it a week. And it does burn off a lot of calories. If you get really good at Zumba with proper weight transfers and balance and can follow the music, then you'll really enjoy it and the weight will almost fall off on its own. Zumba like any other dancing is all about enjoying yourself. Pushing yourself to do more complicated dance patterns and moves. The trick is not to set a weight loss goal, it's to set a dancing achievement goal, that way you'll get addicted and never stop enjoying. Then maybe go take real Zumba classes to challenge yourself, trade tips, etc. Next thing you know you could become a Zumba instructor. It's all about the right motivation. You may not want to become an instructor, but still aim for it so you never stop. Remember, step on toes first, strengthen the core to help with the weight transfers. 

A kilocalorie is equal to 1000 calories. I discovered this a while back. Although the labels on food packages display energy as calories, the actual metric is supposed to be kilocalories. So that apple you may have just ate has 70000 calories or 70 kilocalories. 

Not for me. I'm 41 and returned to the gym about 8 months ago. Workout the same way I've always have before. And people have noticed that I'm getting bigger. So all good. 

I've never managed to get below 46 minutes for a 10k because there is actually quite a big fitness and training gap with just those two minutes. As Rhea points out it's down to miles per week and then raising the tempo from 4:36 km/minute to 4:30 (I think) or using another strategy such as increasing the tempo post 5k. Increasing the weekly mileage will make shaving a few seconds per minute off easier, however the speed training is important for the races as you're rarely able to keep one consistent pace with a lot of runners. I've linked it a few times on the site but the Runner's World Smart Coach can really help, and also doing the speed training on a treadmill. I realise that as someone who hasn't done a sub 45 minute race my advice is really just anecdotal, however I believe enough miles per week turns it into a breeze. 

As you're not a professional athlete (I'm guessing), or even if you were, it's really whatever works best for your body based on the sport and the food which takes a few months of trial and error. 

I experienced quite bad stitch when I first started running, and after some casual research discovered my problem was coming from: 

The main problem with eating breakfast before a work out is you have to wait an hour or more for it to be digested. For jogging, a lot of people prefer to eat a carbohydrate rich meal before bed to avoid the wait in the morning. If you aren't doing anything intense, a low speed 30 minute jog for example, this probably isn't necessary. But for more intense work outs you will use your glycogen supplies quickly without carb-loading the night before. You'll then get tired and do less, and lose lean tissue. So the choice for running is a low intensity jog on a piece of fruit or drink, or mid-high intensity with a meal the night before. 

I will take a stab at it and say it lactic acid build up in the muscles. It has to do with your muscles not efficiently burning its energy due to a lack of oxygen and so you get a build-up of lactic acid. It used to happen to me when I was younger, but not as much now. Lactic Acid Build Up and Soreness in Muscles 

I've tried to take the supplement earlier, maybe I wasn't taking it at least 30 minutes before the workout. Started having gas before going to the gym. Had a wicked workout, and then after, nothing. So that may have solved the problem. 

Last year I went to the Montreal Salsa Convention and had lots of fun dancing all those 5 nights. I had bought trail mix bars and whole grain stuff and lots of proper health food to keep me energized, etc. I had taken a couple of days off of work to help me recuperate. But still within a few days after the convention was over I was super exhausted. I couldn't concentrate. During dance lessons I had no strength and got sent home by my teacher. And the Saturday of the next weekend I had a lot of trouble getting out of bed and it didn't happen until 2pm. Mentally I was in great shape, but physically I was done. It took me a couple of months to fully recover. What are some things I can do to help me recover faster? I'm currently taking BCAA for the gym. The guy at the nutrition store mentioned taking glycogen replenishers which kinda makes sense. But wondering if glycogen depletion is the real issue. 

Read the full article here Also give front squats a try. I wouldn't replace regular squats with them, but alternating might give your lower back a break and let you get more insight on whether it is the muscle that isn't adapting or your form that is causing the issue. 

So all we can really suggest (unless being a nutritionist and making you a complete plan specifically for your needs) is to: 1 - Replace any foods you have no access to with other foods of similar nutritional value. 2 - Don't be lazy. If you need to prepare meals / snacks for the day to achieve the proper nutritional / caloric intake, then do it. There are no shortcuts to a proper diet or putting on muscle. I try and cook for 2-3 days worth of work lunches and snacks at a time and make it part of my routine / schedule to keep up with my nutritional program. You can still eat meals with your family, but you may need to prepare some stuff individually to eat with them while they eat their food, or change your plan to accommodate the different foods you will be eating. But most importantly, if you're going to put in the time to do the workout, you mind as well put in the time to do the nutrition side of things or you will not be getting the desired results. Diet is key in any change in physique. Good luck with your program! 

What do you guys think of this Ideal Body Proportions Chart. It tells me what I have always thought and that is my upper body needs to get bigger. But it also says that my legs are too big by .75 inches. I've never been sure if maybe I should work my legs more to increase their size, this chart says no, but a girl just this week told me to not forget to work my lower body, too. Which seems to suggest my lower body may be too straight and slim. My weight (201 lbs) to height (5'10") ratio is: 2.90 Below are their/my numbers: 

I would say that you start doing some reading. Either browse the magazine rack to see what's there and pick a few and read them. Or read what's on the internet. See what other people do to exercise. Could be all you're interested in is cycling. Or maybe you want to be the next Arnold Schwarzenegger. If weight training is what you are implying, then maybe join a gym and hire a personal trainer for a couple of hours to show you the ropes. They're a tad expensive, but may be a good start. 

I sometimes get muscle soreness from a fairly hard workout, but I don't apply any gel or cream on it as the pain goes away in a couple of days. But if you're feeling something that's chronic then apply gel then see a doctor. 

The advice they give you at runner shops: 6 months (I wonder why?!). Obviously it depends on how many miles you run per week, but you will notice the difference if you change them at least once a year if you do a lot of treadmill running, which is like rubbing them down on sandpaper. 

Using an app like myfitnesspal (or just a post it note) helped me a lot, and you see the fluctuations as it gives you a graph of the week. I did it twice a day and realised sometimes the morning would differ by 2-3 g depending on whether I'd eaten and the other smellier factor mentioned. Personally I find morning the best time to do it, after any bathroom visit and before getting dressed. 

Another exercise involves using the elbow to massage the back, with a fair amount of pressure - obviously you'll need a partner/friend/willing house mate to do it though, and it hurts. 

The secret to feeling full is combining protein with carbohydrates, which also gives you the added benefit of aiding the transport of the increased Tryptophan from the protein. There's a tonne of studies to support this, to quote one: 

The way to increase you lung capacity (vo2 max) is to perform interval training and sprinting, one technique is known as Fartleks. The more you push your lungs (and get out of breath for short periods), the greater your capacity becomes, at least up to a point. One interesting device that is a fairly cheap that claims to improve your inspiratory muscles is the Powerbreathe. It works by you blowing into the device, and it providing resistance for both. Like push ups or press ups, you increase the amount you do each day, and also increase the resistance. 

I've been wondering for a while where protein to build muscle comes from? If I consume protein throughout the day and that protein is pretty much digested and processed within an hour or two of consumption. But most muscle building happens while at rest, how does the protein I consumed at 5:00pm make it to bed time? 

I've had a nerve pinch in my right shoulder for god knows how long. I'm unable to go through the full motion of wide grip pull ups or wide grip cable pulldowns with any moderate weights. Anyone have any ideas how to resolve this. I've tried to some stretching of the shoulders and it seems to help, a bit. Is stretching the way to go and will just take time to resolve? Should I just go see a doctor? This has always been a issue. 

You should be breathing properly while doing cardio, in through the nose and out through the mouth. When you're reading you often forget to breath. That is the reason why you shouldn't read while doing cardio. Of course if you can do those all at the same time, then go to it. 

I've done both riding a bike and roller blading. Biking never did much for me except the pleasure of riding, but roller blading did, especially after having gone to the gym. Roller blading burns off a lot of calories and if the trail is well paved, you could alternate between the two. This one year I was roller blading twice a week along this paved trail along Ontario Lake and lost a lot of weight without trying. 

Well it looks like you have your exercise portion of things in order. Running and going to the gym regularly is for sure helping, but here is your main problem: 

You should at the least know how much the portions you're eating are as well as adjusting how much you eat (not necessarily what you eat) accordingly. If you can change your habits to properly reflect a close enough caloric intake per day to match what you're burning or less, you can lose weight. Obviously it is easier when you avoid bad foods, but just monitoring your overall intake / burned calories is a great start. Use this tool to calculate how many calories your body is burning to know how much you should be eating. As for soccer / feeling you're lacking strength, dedicate (at least) one day a week to do just legs at the gym and really work them out. This article has quite a bit of information on improving your strength for soccer. The tips here all revolve around the idea of reverse engineering your goals, and starting first with strength to be able to then use that power to obtain speed. It is an interesting read, and you should definitely check it out for a better understanding on how to improve your legs for soccer. My own tips for training your legs for strength would be to try doing your exercises one leg at a time, and make sure to do high enough weight / reps to really push them to their potential. Legs tend to have more endurance than other muscles since they are constantly being used throughout the day versus something like your chest that doesn't get nearly as much use. 

The evidence for post-workout protein shakes increasing your performance for running isn't conclusive, so this is somewhat anecdotal advice. I've been running for about 4 years regularly and in the past 6 months tried protein shakes after the long and mid runs. I've increased my speed from 8.1mph to 9mph in that time, and up to 9.5-10mph for 5k runs. I've also lost weight in that period from the eating less via the protein shakes, A 500ml serving keeps you sated for an hour or so later until a main meal, and is about 120 calories. The protein powder I used is by Bio-synergy, which is whey powder (basically dried milk). The cheaper stuff you get at a discount seems to be missing not only taste, but some amino acids and bulked out with soya. The one chose is also targeted at lean muscle growth rather than body building/bulking up, which helps. It's an easy and fairly cheap experiment to try, just be sure to stick with a good brand that is carb free, and avoid the soya shakes. 

In my (limited) experience I would recommend using the Smart Coach to set yourself speed goals. The tool speeds you up gently over a 12-16 week period (or less amount of time if you're feeling like a challenge). It gives you an indurance run, a gentle run and speed training each week. I only use it for 10k running so I can't speak for half or full marathon running, but it really improved my pace a lot - down to about 46 mins from 50+ mins.
