The bike may ride differently. The only way to find out whether it does anything for you is to buy the bike and try it. Ideally by running the same course repeatedly and writing down how you think the bike performs (and the lap times), while someone takes the bike off you, hands it to a mechanic who never sees you, and the mechanic swaps or doesn't swap the part in question. That way you have a double blind test. One well-known framebuilder in the USA (whose name escapes me) did a very limited set of experiments with small variations in frame geometry in the 1990's, and concluded that no rider could tell the difference from less than half a degree change in headset angle. Unfortunately those experiments were fairly expensive to conduct because he had to make 3 or 4 "identical" bikes and find a set of riders who were all the same size. Basically he let the normal variation in a hand-built bike create the variations, and measured the bike after they were built to find out what he had. Then the riders rode the bikes and rated them against each other. The conclusion was that a millimetre variation in tube lengths and half a degree in angles did not cause any repeatable difference in rider evaluation. But with sample sizes of 3 frames and five riders it's not statistically significant. I suspect Trek has similar research (as a result of employing Mike Burrows if nothing else) and would not be at all surprised to find that all major manufacturers have done similar things and specify the tolerances in their manufacturing accordingly. 

Move the slotted plate so it's over the post ready to close. Hold the chain with one hand each side of the master link with the slotted plate towards you. Pull your hands apart slightly so that the chain is straight. Now bend the chain so the master link moves away from you (and the open end of those posts get closer together). 

Side note on design Bicycles experience ridiculous torque at the bottom bracket. Mid-size car levels of torque (but at much lower rpm). That's why BB axles are such heavy, rigid parts. Extending that BB axle to become a shaft drive is tricky. With shaft drives there are two broad options: have a thin, light shaft spinning fast, or a heavier shaft transmitting more torque at lower speed. The thinner, lighter shaft means gearing up a lot at the cranks, then down at the back wheel, and precision bearings to keep friction down for that shaft. But that long, thin shaft is fragile. Making it a bigger, hollow shaft is hard because you really want it inside the frame, or underneath it, and either option is mechanically complex and every gearing step adds friction. It also needs to be completely enclosed because bearing seals would add too much friction. It can be done, but it's cheaper and easier to gear up less and have a stronger shaft spinning more slowly. Normally shafts are sealed but the enclosure means the shaft diameter has to be smaller than the enclosure, and since the total size is limited that means the higher torque option is required. I have ridden a 2WD MTB with a flex shaft drive, and there was significant shaft wind-up under load. That meant that front wheel drive really only kicked in once the rear wheel slipped a bit which was disconcerting. There was also noticeable power loss from the flex shaft. The bike seems to have disappeared, so apparently other people didn't like it either. 

That is a fender (mudguard) mounting bolt. The hole in the bolt slides over the stay that attaches near the axle, and the threaded part goes through a bracket, normally on the mudguard but sometimes at the axle end. 

I replaced mine with a spring-loaded one. You should still try to increase the wrap if you do this. If you can take a link out of the chain that will help. You might even consider a half-link. A worn chain will ride up the teeth under pressure and if the tensioner isn't tight enough it will fall off. A new chain fixes that. likewise, a worn cog can drop the chain or if it's worn enough to have hooked teeth, a new chain can get caught up and you get rear-end chain suck (rare, and I can't imagine that getting enough force to shift your tensioner) you might be able to run the chain over it instead of under, to get more wrap. I couldn't do that because it hit my chainstays. Another option would be to see if you can get horizontal dropouts for your bike. Your dropouts are replaceable, and if you're lucky they offer both vertical and horizontal ones. 

I've not done this, but I beleive the threads are compatible with a standard fixed gear cog. If so, just buy a cog and install it. Then put a lockring from an adjustable bottom bracket on as a lockring (it has the same threads as the hub). Note that this will not works as well as a proper fixie hub, most obviously because it's missing the left hand threaded section that normally holds the fixie lockring in place. I strongly suggest using locktite, or possibly even superglue, to hold the cog in place. Otherwise when you back pedal to brake there's a real danger that the cog will undo and you'll lose drive. There's a detailed explanation here that covers what you've done plus the next steps. 

Since everything else is working, this is when I suspect hanger alignment. Where the rear derailleur bolts on to the bike, just under the quick release/axle, is a relatively fragile piece of metal. They get bent if the derailleur is bumped hard, and for that reason are often replaceable parts. The problem is sufficiently common that there's a tool made specifically to fix it: 

Look inside the shifter, jiggle the bike, trying to see whether there are any loose parts in the shifter (or random debris). Note that it's full of sticky grease so anything loose will likely be stuck in place by the grease. Try to work out what everything does, and whether anything is out of place. If you find something, try to work out whether it broke off the shifter (and if so, whether it's important), or whether it's from the outside. Then remove it. inspect the cable and outer between the shifter and rear derailleur. If there are kinks or damage that will probably be the problem, and it's the thing to fix first. Next, get slack gear cable next to the shifter. Often there will be open sections of cable and you can pop a section of outer off the bike to get this. The attachment to the frame looks like this, although they're usually welded on rather than riveted: Now you can pull the cable to make sure it slides freely in each section of outer. If it doesn't , replace it. What you're looking for here is not "maybe a little extra friction" but "hard or impossible to move by hand". The shifter. Look for obvious damage. Hopefully you did that already :) Specifically, if the release lever that's not returning is bent it might rub on the body of the shifter. Even plastic levers do this. If there's abrasion on the plastic at the join between lever and body that can also produce this effect, and carefully trimming away the damaged plastic along the join can sometimes fix it. Click through gears. Without the derailleur pulling on the cable it will only shift into the lowest gear, but it should do that easily. Pull gently on the cable as it leaves the shifter. You're just reproducing the pull from the derailleur spring, not ripping the shifter off the handlebars. Now click the other lever on that shifter to change back up through the gears. 

I suspect the market for basic, obvious MTeB's is more couples and families, allowing them to go out for a ride together that's more interesting than just easy laps around a well-formed trail in a park. Of course, none of this is actually new. The first power assist mountain bike I saw had a bunch of lead-acid batteries bolted to an early mountain bike, and that would have been before 1990. I've been seeing what look like reasonably capable MTeB's in catalogues and online for quite a few years. The slow change I'm seeing is that there are more "MTB parks" and so on with very easy trails, so it's more realistic for someone who rides with assist on the road to also ride the easier trails. The technology is also there now to conceal the motor to a large extend, reducing the reluctance of unfit people to buy one and go out riding with their fitter mates. At some point that tech crosses over with outright cheating in races, which we're also seeing more of now. What we have been seeing for a while is "electric trail bikes" sold as "electric mountain bike", with the huge benefit over a petrol "trail bike" is that the former doesn't need registration and can often be ridden in areas where motor vehicles are banned. This is also why they're controversial with many MTB people, as they allow silent, very fast, and unexpectedly heavy bikes to use MTB tracks. There are two differences between those and power assisted bicycles though. Bicycles in most countries are limited to 200W or 250W, where trail bikes are usually 1kW or more. The second is the key "assist" word. The bicycle can be ridden without power assistance, the motorbike can't be. That makes the difference between an "electric mountain bike" and a power assisted bicycle pretty simple - if it's under 250W and you can ride without the motor, it's a bicycle. There was a case in NSW where a cop told someone on a "pedal scooter" (looks like a motor scooter, has pedals sticking out the sides) to turn the motor off and pedal it a few hundred metres, which the rider was unable to do. Ticket issued, court case lost. 

The short answer is that the 11 speed cassette is slightly wider than a 10 speed one (34.95->36.75mm = +1.8mm) which in turn is slightly wider than a 9 speed one. Sheldon Brown died before Shimano 11 speed came out, so his chart only goes up to Campag 11 speed, that that suggests 36.5mm for Shimano 9 speed compared to 40.1mm for Campag 11 speed (+3.6mm). You'll note that those numbers don't match up, so it comes back to "measure it yourself". To prevent the practical problem of someone buying the wrong cassette, fitting it, then complaining that it doesn't work, they have a different arrangement of ridges on the freewheel. In your case, you already know that you need a new derailleur and shifter, but not everyone does. Now, it's possible you could change the freewheel to an 11spd one and spread your frame slightly to accommodate it, but that would be a DIY task not a bike shop one I suspect. The bike shop could well refuse to spread an aluminium frame because that would probably fatally weaken it, but under Australian law they're liable for any damage they do (including the key point in this case, making the bike not fit for purpose). With most steel frames you could reasonably spread them 4 or 5 millimetres, use a longer axle and an extra spacer, and the only question would be whether you can fit the 11 speed freewhel you that hub. 

In Australia and New Zealand you can't be arrested directly for speeding (you can instead be arrested for failing to stop or not obeying police instructions etc once you attract police attention). Australian road rules: chain it together as "20 Obeying the speed limit A driver must not drive at a speed over the speed limit ..." through "19 References to driver includes rider etc" to "17 Who is a rider (1) A rider is the person who is riding a motor bike, bicycle, animal or animal-drawn vehicle." You can be ticketed for speeding, even though you are not required to have any means to know your speed. For example in Centennial Park in Sydney there is a 30kph limit and fairly regularly the police track and occasionally ticket cyclists there. On public roads it's much less common but does happen. Examples 56kph in 40kph zone and "Can be ticketed" article with possible mention of a fine being issued. In NZ I've seen cyclists prosecuted for disorderly behaviour because that's a catch-all for "things we don't like" and can be applied to anyone (NZ and Australia both count skateboards etc as "toy vehicles" and people on them count as pedestrians).
