One alternative would be to use Software Restriction Policies (Computer Configuration -> Windows Settings -> Security Settings) rather than the "Do Not Run Specified Windows Applications" user policy. This will also give you more flexibility around how you select the application to be blocked. Keep in mind that any blacklisting approach can be worked around. If you want to ensure that the restriction can't be bypassed, you'll need to use Software Restriction Policies in whitelist mode, i.e., specify those applications that are allowed to run rather than those that are not. 

Another possibility would be to temporarily disable Enhanced Security Configuration. (NB: Oracle have accepted a bug report, JDK-8140197.) 

After upgrading Java to version 8u171 the Java KVM client provided by my Dell BMC's web interface stopped working. The only error message is "Connection failed." I'm using the BMC on a PowerEdge C6220, but other models may also be affected. What's going on and how can I fix it? 

Powershell (as per SvenW's answer) is best practice, but if you prefer the old fashioned command line: 

Don't understand exactly what you need to know (and where is the question)but if i understand a few: use dhcp relay. How to do that : $URL$ 

I don't have a reply for point 1-2-3 but you can check with your virtual enginner about Vmware host config . If he is VCP he will understand the stuff :) You really have to check your host because windows problems could be on the host not in the guest . There is many hardware feature that could explain your problems , directpath io , rss , vcpu , power management scheme ... I can give you some link that help your virtual team , or you :) This link is about tuning the host $URL$ And this fat pdf : $URL$ And this one is about rss : $URL$ 

If you think about ssh when you talk about "logged" you can use syslog and rsyslog . For rsyslog check that : $URL$ With some setup you can send log by mail or with log system stack (elk stack , graylog2 , splunk , etc). 

This error occurs when the user has existing permissions on the Active Directory OU that the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC) doesn't know how to deal with. It should be noted that group policy delegations are really just permissions on the OU, the GPMC just provides a simplified interface to make the necessary permissions changes easier. You can use Active Directory Users and Computers to check the permissions on the OU. You will need to enable "Advanced Features" from the View menu in order to see the Security tab for an OU object, and you will need to choose "Advanced" to see the detailed permissions list. In my case, the group in question had been explicitly granted "Read" access to the OU, which must have been added by mistake at some point since it is redundant. In the linked question on the Microsoft Forums, the user was attempting to change delegation for the Domain Admins group which by default has Full Control on all OUs. In my case, since the existing Read permission didn't need to be there, I removed it using Active Directory Users and Computers. I was then able to use the GPMC to add the delegation I wanted. The user in the linked Microsoft Forums question could have removed the Full Control permission for Domain Admins the same way, which would have also removed the group policy delegation as a side-effect. (Whether this is a sensible change is another matter!) In other cases, if the extra permissions cannot be removed, you can grant the necessary delegation directly in Active Directory Users and Computers rather than via the Group Policy Management Console. If you want to grant the "Link GPOs" delegation then the necessary access permissions are "Read gPLink", "Write gPLink", "Read gPOptions", and "Write gPOptions". Once the change is made, refreshing the view in the Group Policy Management Console should show the newly created delegation. 

Software assurance give you the right to upgrade during software assurance life . You don't have to transfer license but request new one. Its in your microsoft vlsc account. $URL$ be carefull with virtual licensing . microsoft say : 2012 r2 is 2 vitual + 1 physical references : $URL$ 

In the website world some people use ww2 to load balance and/or do A/B testing with "real user load" on a second cluster . Sometime its just a trick used to load with real user and do some benchmark on new stuff :) 

There is solution for your need : 1- use a hids software agent on client to log event to a server . Need install on client , config server , don't work outside without vpn etc . (Ossec or other siem/hids tools do the job) 2- use windows audit capability to centralize all events. This work without tools on client side . you just have to run script/gpo with configuration to send security log to a centralization server . Look this one : $URL$ After that you need some script to read audit log in centralized server and write to database . There is tools like Nxlog ,Snare that do the job (read event log and format for a syslog ). And logstash can read syslog and write in a database (nosql database , or sql database) . There is commercial software doing that too but its not the place to talk about that (google for commercial product). 

Test Procedure The machine I'm experimenting with is PowerEdge 2970 with a DRAC 5, Hardware Version A00, Firmware Version 1.60 (11.03.03). The BMC Firmware Version is 2.50. The NIC Selection is set to Shared and the NIC is enabled. The static IP address is 192.168.241.100 and the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0. There is no gateway on our management network so I have that set to 0.0.0.0. Auto negotiation is on. None of the other settings are configured. With the management network connected to LOM1 (and the LAN connected to LOM2) I can both ping the DRAC and log into the DRAC web interface from a production machine with access to the management network. (IP address 192.168.241.102/255.255.255.0.) I cannot ping the DRAC from a machine on the LAN (mis)configured to use 192.168.241.29/255.255.255.0, even after clearing the ARP cache. With the management network connected to LOM2 (and the LAN connected to LOM1) I can neither ping the DRAC from the management network machine or connect to it via the web interface. Clearing the ARP cache had no effect. I can ping the DRAC and access the web interface from the machine on the LAN. In both cases the operating system on the 2970 has full network connectivity on both the LAN and the management network (once the network interfaces are appropriately configured). I also tried using WinDump to look for arp replies on both the management network and the LAN. In both cases, I saw arp replies from the DRAC only on the network that LOM1 was plugged into. 

In nginx folder, I am seeing this folder with 777 permissions which I can't access in SFTP. Is this normal? $URL$ I don't understand that that little arrow on top of the folder means. Sorry for being a noob! 

is there a similar rule to rewrite the FROM name ? UPDATE After reading the postfix manual, it is desirable not to alter the message headers. However, how can I tell postfix not to write any message headers and use whatever names i have set up in Google Aps ? 

W3 total cache is not performing very well with this setup so I am thinking of abandoning it all together. That leaves me with no caching, no CDN at all at this point. Any help pointing to the right direction with regards to my caching needs, would be much appreciated. 

Tried to follow this tutorial to determine correct settings that I need. $URL$ I can't run this command because it's not supported by Php-fpm 7 apparently. 

Using Postfix on Ubuntu 16 with google smtp server. Everything works fine. The only problem is that I can't seem to find out how to change the FROM name in postfix. I have rewritten the email address successfully in using: 

If you are carrying out unattended installations of Windows 10, and want WinRE to be disabled automatically during installation, delete the following file from the install image: 

They are related in that UAC relies on the existence of ACLs (and all the related security apparatus) in order to function. UAC works by removing (technically speaking, disabling) the Administrators token from non-elevated processes. This means that if the ACL for a particular file or folder only allows access to Administrators, non-elevated processes won't have access. That's why an installer can't write to Program Files without elevating first. EDIT: See this article for more information about UAC. In particular: "When an administrator logs on to a computer that is running Windows 7 or Windows Vista, the user is assigned two separate access tokens. Access tokens, which contain a user's group membership and authorization and access control data, are used by the Windows operating system to control what resources and tasks the user can access." I suppose you could argue that UAC depends on the Windows authorization model, of which ACLs are only a particular component, and that therefore UAC is not related to ACLs. I don't think that's a useful way of looking at it. Let me put it this way: if there weren't any ACLs, UAC would be pointless. You should also read this article which addresses some common misconceptions about UAC, and in particular the misconception that it is a security feature: "The primary goal of UAC is to enable more users to run with standard user rights. However, one of UAC's technologies looks and smells like a security feature: the consent prompt. Many people believed that the fact that software has to ask the user to grant it administrative rights means that they can prevent malware from gaining administrative rights." 

You can do that with url rewrite and binding on you iis site . check for iis rewrite modules rules here : $URL$ 

If i check perf counter for mssql there is no perf counter for vcpu/core . To check perf counter available on your mssql server do that: select * from sys.dm_os_performance_counters But if you do the perfcounter from windows view there is counter for every vcpu/core. 

Probably a trust problem . Doucle check ntp :) Weird problems sometime are just a stupid clock problems . Set same ntp on the two domain . Double check the trust , and dns name . If you ping the domain name and all ok check for eventslogs on source and target server . Try with Test-computersecurechannel in pshell . 

Termina server (rdp server now) work like that : -user connected on server view printer localy installed on the server or connected by script/group policy. -if remote printer is enabled on tse and client tse , user on the server can view localy installed printer on the server if the driver is installed on the server (for 2003 server). And only the user connecting their printer . To resolve your share problem with connected printer via remote session its better to use printer as local one (with ip with or without vpn) because rdp 2003 is not very good at handling printer job. And this prevent share right delete. And there is near 0 compression on print job with old rdp protocole. 2008 and later are better at handling printer job inside rdp session. 

As documented in Description of the Windows Update Standalone Installer in Windows, is designed for installing updates in the form of files. It cannot install updates that are in files. To install an update in a CAB file, use instead, e.g.,: 

The two "Do not process the legacy run list" settings appear under Computer Configuration -> Polices -> Administrative Templates -> System -> Logon and under User Configuration -> Policies -> Administrative Templates -> System -> Logon respectively. The documentation for these settings is confusing (i.e., wrong); what exactly do these two settings do, and how do they interact? 

If the service is running as Local System or Network Service, or as a specific domain user, it can either access the files via the UNC path or it can map a network drive using the function. In the case of Local System or Network Service, the connection is made in the context of the Active Directory computer object. If the service is running as a local user, UNC paths will not work, but it can still map a network drive using provided it can provide a valid username and password. (If the Win32 API is not available for some reason, running the command in a subprocess will also work.) 

I have done a lot of research but haven't seen anywhere any concrete caching recommendation for my server configuration. 

I intend to use W3 total cache for caching purposes and was wondering whether I should be going for Memcached or APC ? Any experiences to share? 

Using Wordpress on Nginx. I am receiving these errors but I can't seem to find out where in my Nginx options I have specified this 'DENY' header. 

Since these are already logged in ufw.log how can i stop them from appearing at kern.log and syslog ? Is there something I must do to prevent these attacks or is this normal for a server to experience? 

I have added this rule to receive real-time alerts but I would like to modify it or add another rule so that I can exclude the sub-folder 

Running a public wordpress site and every few minutes I am seeing these kind of entries on my syslog on my ubuntu server. (I have hidden my mac/ip address in the logs below) What is happening here?
