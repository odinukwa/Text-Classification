Probiotic Bacteria Enhance Murine and Human Intestinal Epithelial Barrier Function, Gastroenterology, 2001. Choice quote: 

Note that people with $50k or less in income have a ~72% chance to vote with just stating their name, and ~66% chance to vote if required to present photo ID, compared to 85% to 83% reduction for those making $750k. To me, that's a very significant effect, and clearly demonstrates that photo ID requirements will reduce turnout of lower-income voters. 

So, so long as the chiropractor isn't using subluxation, it may have more health benefits than @nico's answer would lead me to believe. 

Unfortunately, it's paywalled, like many other legal documents on the subject, which limits my ability to present the results here. Meanwhile, Alvarez et al noted similar effects, going further into the data than Lott: 

So, to completely counter the currently accepted result (as of 4 Jan 2012, anyway), a new study from the Annals Of Internal Medicine shows that chiropractic and neck exercises is a more effective treatment for neck pain than drugs (NSAIDs or narcotics). For instance: 

Now, here's the rub: Do Dannon, Yakult, or any of these other companies provide these bacteria? That I don't know, but the idea that probiotics themselves do nothing has been shown to be wrong. 

I would avoid it. First, DMSO causes everything that's sitting on your skin to get absorbed into your bloodstream (the wikipedia article about it is fairly thorough), to the point that it's actually a drug delivery system. Putting it onto your skin means that other things on your skin will get in as well. The skin acts as the first line of defense against the outside world. According to the NY Times, in 1994, a woman who treated herself topically for pain with DMSO had the chemical metabolize into a nerve gas in her bloodstream: 

However, there's also this trend that running (and walking) barefoot is good for you, which seems like it would be exposing me to all this lead that's around us, including: 

So, organic tomatoes have more vitamins, the tradeoffs for producing and eating them may not be good. Also, it's important to note that the review referenced in @ilvel's answer mimics the results of the 2006 study I posted, namely: 

These are some of the same hormones released during orgasm; as such, these hormones might cause a risk reduction. A causal link was hypothesized in 1995: 

Well, all respect to the EFSA, but there are several claims about probiotics that can be found in about five minutes on scholar.google.com that show clear health benefits, not least of which appear to be increased resistance to salmonella infections and improved skin condition in children with dermatitis. Namely: The role of probiotic cultures in the control of gastrointestinal health, the Journal of Nutrition, 2000. Choice quote from the abstract: 

This same Dr. Jacob appears all over the dmso.org website, so he may or may not have a commercial interest in thinking that the chemical analysis in the Discover article is bogus. In any event, as I said, I would avoid it. 

There is a slight reduction in risk associated with breast feeding (again, relevant because these are the same hormones): 

In other words, cannabis causes increased prostate cancer cell death. They suggest that more study is warranted: 

However, most searches for breast cancer and orgasm relates to the sexual activity of survivors, rather than the possible preventative technique of frequent orgasm. tl;dr: There may be a link, even a causal link, but the effect appears to be pretty slight, and difficult to isolate relative to the other producers of the hormone. 

He goes on to provide a number of other metrics, but they all seem to rely on the assumption that the introduction of a voter ID law should result in a lower number of participating voters. To me, this seems like a shaky assumption, when such a small percentage of potentially eligible voters is participating in any given election. If only 50% (or fewer) of people are voting, then increasing to 54% does not mean that some people were disenfranchised, it just means that more people decided to go vote. People could still have been disenfranchised, and not reflected in final vote tallies. Richard Atkinson argued in 2007 that the logic in Lott's article is incorrect: 

So, according to this one (conservative) commentator, non-photo ID laws do not affect turnout, while the jury is still out on whether or not photo ID laws do affect turnout. Lott's arguments seem to mimic those of @user1873; namely, that participation increased, so therefore there could not have been a suppression of the vote. Later in the paper, he states: 

In this chart, note that there is a difference between organic and nonorganic foods as relates to vitamin C concentration. 

It seems to depend on who you ask, and they will depend on different interpretations of the same data gathered since HAVA went into effect. tl;dr Photo ID does not seem to lead to minority voter suppression, but it does lead to drops in lower income voter participation. If you ask John Lott or the Federalist Society, voter fraud is a known problem, with increasing persecutions and dire consequences, while increasing voter ID requirements actually seems to produce more voters (and campaign finance laws reduce voter turnout). From John Lott: 

So, as the chart shows, organic tomatoes have more vitamin C. The recent claim, as reported by the NYT and NPR, glosses over these levels of minute variation. Note also, that the Stanford study, linked by @vartec and the foundation of the NPR article, discusses health effects in humans, not vitamin content in the fruits themselves. The conclusions of that review did mirror those of the Standford study, notably: 

A friend of mine sent me an article (from the AP, which has since pulled the article) claiming that walking around in the house with shoes on will expose everyone to dangerous levels of lead, especially if the house was made before lead paint was banned. The EPA makes similar claims, among them: 

Also, the University of Minnesota claims that there's lots of lead in the air, and so forth, with this graphic: 

The answer is yes, in laboratory experiments, and perhaps in a clinical setting as well. Let me emphasize: the proof exists in controlled laboratory experiments. It has not been demonstrated to be true in human trials. So don't smoke up in the expectation that it's a better cancer treatment than a doctor's recommendations (generally chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or surgery, but would vary from patient to patient). An article by Guzman in 2003 states that: 

Effect of probiotic Lactobacillus strains in children with atopic dermatitis, Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, 2003. Choice quote: 

(X-Axis categories are: State Name, Sign Name, Signature Match, ID Requested, ID Required, ID Required + Signature Match, Photo ID Requested, Photo ID Required) Given that this second paper acknowledges the incompleteness of the aggregate data in describing voter behavior, and then proceeds to address that lack in a closer examination of individual behavior, I believe they have produced a more robust argument that stringent voter ID laws lead to voter suppression. Even so, they proceed to Figure 6, which shows that there's no correlation between race and voter suppression, and suggest that it is actually whites who are more disenfranchised than non-whites: 

As the abstract further states, the patients couldn't be blinded (ie, no placebo chiropractic or home exercise treatments could be done), so it's tricky in the sense of traditional blinding to produce accepted results. Furthermore, it's important to try to determine which kind of chiropractic therapy will be done. This article discusses the chiropractic theory of subluxation, and proceeds to debunk it: 

The hormone claim means that there could be a causal link. However, these hormones (oxytocin and prolactin) are released during breastfeeding and other normal activities. These hormones are therefore released during the course of other activities, and isolating their potential effects to just orgasm is tricky. One population to examine are nulliparous (never had a child) women and men, as these groups won't be lactating; however, oxytocin is also associated with social behaviors and is known as the 'love hormone', so again, isolating orgasm as a sole producer of sufficient oxytocin to reduce breast cancer risk is difficult. It may also be that all the social activity leading up to and after orgasm also causes oxytocin release, in which case orgasm may not be the sole cause of any risk reduction. Prolactin is also a hormone that does more than just orgasm response: 

Or roughly 1 in 4 by age 50. Women in the general population of the United States, according to SEER, have a 1 in 233 chance of being diagnosed with breast cancer from ages 30-39, and 1 in 69 from ages 40-49. The fact that the 1981 study limited their cohort to patients who were exceptionally young (below 32 years of age) smacks of selection bias to me, meaning that those patients were carrying some genetic marker like BRCA1 in order to even be included in the study in the first place. Beyond that, it's hard to say whether or not the observed increases were due to noise in the data or not, since they didn't perform genetic testing on the patients. However, if those patients were all carrying those risk factors, those factors would certainly explain how they got cancer so young, in light of other studies finding that abortion is not a correlated factor. 

I could not find recent studies showing that DMSO was a useful healing agent, although it does appear to be used as a control in other wound healing studies, including those for PADMA 28 (Aslam et al, 2010, Barak et al, 2004); and for Caspase 8. So, while it might do some good, it might also do some real harm. Another account in Discover stated that a doctor who supports the use of DMSO as a healing remedy, Stanley Jacob: 

Depends on the food-- Organic Tomatoes have more Vitamin C A large review in 2006 showed that different vegetables have different contents depending on the farming practices used (ie, organic vs non-organic). Most helpful here, including sources, is Table 2 of that study. In that table, the following statements describe the results of various fruits and vegetables, as well as providing references to each claim: 

There is one study from 1981 that suggests that there is a positive correlation between early abortion and breast cancer in patients younger than 32: 

The question, at the time, is what the causal relationship is to inhibiting tumor growth. The answer to that question is apparently dependent on the type of cancer. For instance, in prostate cancer, a metastudy (Ramos and Bianco, 2012) found that: 

There have been some reported healing improvement on gastric ulcers in rats, viz. Naito et al in 1995: 

In addition, Melbye et al in 1997 agreed with this second study. Using a much larger pool than the 1981 study, and with much sounder statistical methodology (not to mention a larger N), they found no relative increase of risk as a result of abortion. So how can the results of the 1981 study be explained? 1981 was prior to any genetic screenings, so their abstract text of "This increased risk could not be explained by other risk factors" might have to be changed, as several more genetic risk factors have been found since then. Notably, BRCA1 was first described in 1991 and cloned in 1994; Ford et al found in 1998 that 

Note, however, the very large error bars for the minority voters-- this gap is probably why the problem is so difficult to resolve. Even so, the authors claim that it is not race that determines real suppression, but income. They continue, with a later figure: 

Can I run/walk around without shoes on without fear of lead contamination? What about wearing shoes from outside and then not taking them off when inside-- will I also be bringing lead around? I'm skeptical that I need to worry about lead in the air or soil if I have no lead paint on or near the property, but maybe I'm not paranoid enough.
