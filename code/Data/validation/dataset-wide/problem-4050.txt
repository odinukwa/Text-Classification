Your conjecture that ${\rm im} (1-{\rm Ad}_g)\subseteq {\rm im}( {\rm ad}\,X)$ is indeed true. Let me sketch the argument. First we reduce to the case where the regular element $X\in \mathfrak{g}$ is nilpotent. In $\mathfrak g$, we have the Jordan-Chevalley decomposition $X=X_s+X_n$ of $X$ and the centraliser $\mathfrak{l}={\rm Lie}(L)$ of $X_s$ in $\mathfrak g$ is a Levi subalgebra of $\mathfrak g$. The centraliser $L=Z_G(X_s)$ is a Levi subgroup of $G$; in particular, it is connected and reductive. Since ${\rm ad}\,X$ acts invertibly on the eigenspaces $\mathfrak{g}_\lambda$ of ${\rm ad}\,X_s$ with $\lambda\ne 0$ and ${\rm Ad}_g-1$ preserves each $\mathfrak{g}_\lambda$ we just need to show that $({\rm Ad}_g-1)(\mathfrak{l})\subseteq [X,\mathfrak{l}]$. The subspace on the right equals $[X_n,\mathfrak{l}]$ and $X_n$ is a regular nilpotent element of $\mathfrak{l}$. Since $\mathfrak{l}=\mathfrak{z}(\mathfrak{l})\oplus [\mathfrak{l},\mathfrak{l}]$ and $L=Z(L)\cdot (L,L)$ we may assume without loss that $L=G$ and $X=e$ is regular nilpotent. The centraliser $Z_G(e)$ is generated by $Z(G)$ and the connected component $Z_G(e)^\circ$ which is unipotent. So no generality will be lost by assuming that $g$ is unipotent. So far the argument works under very mild assumptions on the characteristic of the base field, but to make this post shorter I will now use exponentiation and hence rely on the fact that ${\rm char}(K)=0$. Since $g\in Z_G(e)$ is unipotent we can write ${\rm Ad}_g =\exp\,{\rm ad}\,n$ for some nilpotent element $n\in \mathfrak{g}_e$ where $\mathfrak{g}_e$ denotes the centraliser of $e$ in $\mathfrak g$. Moreover, ${\rm im}({\rm Ad}_g-1)={\rm im}({\rm ad}\,n)$. So we just need to show that $[n,\mathfrak{g}]\subseteq [e,\mathfrak{g}]$ for any $n\in \mathfrak{g}_e$. As the Killing for $\kappa$ of $\mathfrak g$ is nondegenerate and $\mathfrak{g}$-invariant, it is easy to see that $\mathfrak{g}_e$ coincides with the orthogonal complement of $[e,\mathfrak{g}]$ with respect to $\kappa$. So we just need to check that $\kappa([n,\mathfrak{g}],\mathfrak{g}_e)=0$. By the $\mathfrak{g}$-invariance of $\kappa$, this is equivalent to $[n,\mathfrak{g}_e]=0$. The latter holds because for $e$ regular the centraliser $\mathfrak{g}_e$ is abelian. 

If $e$ is principal in a proper Levi subalgebra whose Dynkin diagram involves a component of type $A_k$ with $k$ odd, then e is not even. This is very easy to see by writing down an explicit $sl_2$-triple containing $e$. Occasionally, one can find another good grading for such $e$ (if it is Richardson) but this is quite rare outside type $A$. Also, if $e\ne 0$ is rigid in the sense of Lusztig-Spaltenstein then $e$ is never even (nor Richardson) and for $g$ exceptional all rigid nilpotent orbits except two (I think) are principal in Levi subalgebras. From the representation-theoretic viewpoint, rigid nilpotent elements give rise to the most interesting finite $W$-algebras. 

Yes, and in fact it suffices to use only the the $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-triple associated with the minimal nilpotent orbit of $V$. Let $G$ be the adjoint group of $V$, so that $V={\rm Lie}(G)$. Then $\wedge^2 V$ is spanned by all $G$-conjugates of $e\wedge f$ where $e=e_{\alpha}$ and $f=e_{-\alpha}$ and $\alpha$ is the highest root of $V$ (we can choose any Borel subgroup of $G$). Note that $V$ is an irreducible $G$-module where we assume that $G$ acts on $V$ via the adjoint representation. This also induces a natural action of $G$ on $\wedge^2 V$. Although $\wedge^2 V$ is no longer $G$-irreducible (if ${\rm rk}\, V\ge 2$) we still know that it is generated (as a $G$-module) by $e\wedge f$. Indeed, let $W$ be $G$-submodule generated by $e\wedge f$. We first apply positive root vectors to $e\wedge f$ to deduce that $W$ contains $e\wedge v$ for $v\in V$. After that we apply negative root vectors to $e\wedge v$ to deduce by induction (on height of roots involved in $u$) that $u\wedge v\in W$ for all $u,v\in V$. Since any spanning set contains a basis of $\wedge^2V$, we are done. If $V=\mathfrak{sl}_2$ one just need three $G$-conjugates of $e\wedge f$, say $e\wedge f$, $({\rm Ad}\,g_1)(e)\wedge ({\rm Ad}\,g_1)(f)$ and $({\rm Ad}\,g_2)(e)\wedge ({\rm Ad}\,g_2)(f)$ for some $g_1,g_2$ in $G={\rm SL}_2$. There is plenty of choice for that. 

It is true in types $G_2$, $F_4$ and $E_6$, but in types $E_7$ and $E_8$ one has to exclude $p=7$, $p=13$ and $p=19$ as well (I think $p=19$ occurs only in type $E_8$). More on this can be found in Jantzen's paper "First cohomology groups for classical Lie algebras" published in Progress in Math., vol. 95, 1991 (the best way to find this paper is to google the title). For related results, see also the paper by Gilkey and Seitz titled "Some representations of exceptional Lie algebras" and published in Geom. Dedicata, 25, (1988), 407-416. That the Weyl module $V(\varpi_6)$ for $G=E_7(K)$ is reducible in characteristic $7$ is quite easy to see directly: the minuscule module $V(\varpi_7)$ has a nondegenerate $G$-invariant symplectic form and by using Weyl's formula one observes that $V(\varpi_6)$ can be obtained from the second fundamental Weyl module for $Sp_{56}(K)$ by restriction to $G$. The latter Weyl module is reducible in characteristic $7$ as $7$ divides $56$. 

Let $\mathfrak{n}_-$ be the Lie algebra of the derived subgroup $N_-$ of $B_{-}$ where $B_{-}=TN_-$ is a Borel subgroup of $G$ opposite to a Borel subgroup $B_+\subset P$ (here $T$ is a split maximal torus of $G$ defined over $\mathbb{Z}$). If $V_\mathbb{Z}$ is a minimal admissible $\mathbb{Z}$-lattice then there is a highest weight vector $v\in V$ (for $B_+$) such that $V_{\mathbb{Z}}=U^{-}_{\mathbb Z}\cdot v$ where $U^{-}_{\mathbb Z}$ is the Kostant $\mathbb{Z}$-form of the universal enveloping algebra $U(\mathfrak{n}_-)$. It is spanned over $\mathbb{Z}$ by the PBW-monomials in $e_\alpha^n/n!$ where $\alpha$ is a negative root of $G$ with respect to $T$ and $n\in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0}$ (the root vectors $e_\alpha$ should come from a Chevalley basis of $\mathfrak{g}={\rm Lie}(G)$). It follows that $V_\mathbb{Z}\cap M$ is spanned over $\mathbb{Z}$ by the elements of the form $X\cdot v$ where $X$ is a PBW monomial in $e_\alpha^n/n!$ and $\alpha$ is a negative root of $P$ with respect to $T$. This shows that $V_\mathbb{Z}\cap M$ is a minimal admissible lattice for a Levi subgroup of $P$. 

In some cases the answer to the weaker version of the question (involving the semisimple part of $X_2$) is YES. This will happen if $C_g(e)$ is self-dual which is the case, for instance, when $g=gl_N$, $N=nm$, and $e$ has $n$ Jordan blocks of size $m$. To see this, one can use the fact that all maximal toral subalgebras of $C_g(e)$ are conjugate. However, in general the answer to the question is NO as the following example shows. Let $g=sp_4$ and $e$ a long root vector in $g$. Then the action of $ad\ h$ on $g$ gives us a $\mathbb{Z}$-grading $g=g(-2)\oplus g(-1)\oplus g(0)\oplus g(1)\oplus g(2)$ with $g(-2)=\mathbb{C}f$, $g(2)=\mathbb{C}e$, $g(0)\cong gl(2)$, $g(-1)$ the standard $2$-dimensional module for $g(0)$, and $g(1)\cong g(-1)^*$ as $g(0)$-modules. We also have that $C_g(f)= g(0)'\oplus g(-1)\oplus g(-2)$ and $C_g(e,f)=g(0)'$. Let {$x,H,y$} be an $sl_2$-triple in $g(0)'$ which spans $g(0)'\cong sl_2$ and let {$v_1,v_{-1}$} and {$w_1,w_{-1}$} be eigenbases for $ad\ H$ of $g(1)$ and $g(-1)$, respectively, so that $[H,v_1]=v_1$, $[H,w_{-1}]=-w_{-1}$, etc. We choose $X=X_1+X_2+X_3$ such that $X_1=0$, $X_2=H+y$ and $X_3=w_{1}$. Then $X_2$ is semisimple and $[X_2,X_3]=w_1+w_{-1}$. We may adjust $X$ effectively only by applying automorphisms of the form $Ad\ g$ with $g$ in the unipotent radical of the centraliser of $e$ in $Sp_4$. Then $Ad\ g=\exp(a\ ad\ e)\exp(b\ ad\ v_1)\exp(c\ ad\ v_{-1})$ for some $a,b,c\in\mathbb{C}$. Such an adjustment is not going to change $X_3=w_1$, but it will replace $X_2=H+y$ by $H+y+b[v_1,w_1]+c[v_{-1},w_1]=H+y+\lambda x+\mu H$ for some $\lambda,\mu\in\mathbb{C}$. (It will change $X_1$ as well, but this is not important.) Since $[x,w_1]=0$ and $[y,w_1]=w_{-1}$, this is not going to help us to improve $X$ the way we wanted. 

Here is a complete answer to this question: the map $\varphi$ is an embedding if and only if the group $H$ contains a maximal torus of $G$. I'm assuming (as in the question) that all groups are complexified but originate from a compact group. The map $\varphi$ is injective if and only if no nonzero $G$-invariant function on $\mathfrak g$ vanishes on $X:=G\cdot \mathfrak{h}$. This happens if and only if $X$ is Zariski dense in $\mathfrak g$ (if $X$ is not dense then $f(X)=0$ for some nonzero invariant $f\in S(\mathfrak{g}^*)^G$ by an old result of Nagata). Since the original group was compact the group $H$ is reductive (as $H(\mathbb{R})$ is anisotropic). Let $T_0$ be a maximal torus of $H$ and $\mathfrak{t}_0={\rm Lie}(T_0)$, a Cartan subalgebra of $\mathfrak{h}$. As all maximal tori in $H$ are conjugate and the semisimple elements of $\mathfrak{h}$ are dense in $\mathfrak{h}$, the set $H \cdot \mathfrak{t}_0$ is dense in $\mathfrak{h}$. So $\varphi$ is injective if and only if $G\cdot\mathfrak{t}_0=G\cdot (H\cdot\mathfrak{t}_0)={(G\cdot\mathfrak{h})}_s=X_s$ is dense in $\mathfrak{g}$. Now $T_0$ is contained in a maximal torus of of $G$, say $T$, and it follows from the theorem of the dimension of fibres of a morphism that $\dim X = \dim G\cdot \mathfrak{t}_0\le \dim G+\dim \mathfrak{t}_0-\dim T$. So $X$ is dense in $\mathfrak g$ if and only if $T_0=T$ as claimed. 

Such modules do exist for $p>3$. The Lie algebra $L_p={\rm Der}\ H(2;\underline{1};\Phi(\tau))^{(1)}$ has a filtration of depth $1$ such that ${\rm gr}(L)$ is a graded Lie algebra of type $\rm H$. This can be seen by embedding it into $W(2;\underline{1})$ as explained in Strade's paper in Can. J. Math. , vol. 43, 1991, 580-616. As $TR(L)=2$ the Lie algebra $L_p$ contains a $2$-dimensional torus, $T$ say. Any $2$-dimensional torus of $L_p$ must intersect trivially with $(L_p)_{(0)}$ because any nonzero torus of $(L_p)_{(0)}$ is $1$-dimensional and has no zero weight on $L_p/(L_p)_{(0)}$ (here $(L_p)_{(0)}$ is the zero component of the filtration). Passing to corresponding graded algebras and modules and using some results on representations of $H(2;\underline{1})^{(2)}$ mentioned in Jim's answer one can see that all but two of the irreducible restricted representations of $L_p$ are induced from irreducible restricted representations of $(L_p)_{(0)}$. The equality $L_p=T\oplus (L_p)_{(0)}$ then shows that all possible $T$-weights (including zero) occur in such modules with the same multiplicity. As a historical remark I should add that irreducible representations of finite dimensional graded Cartan type Lie algebras of type ${\rm W, S,H}$ were first studied in the late 70s by Ya. Krylyuk, a former PhD student of Kostrikin. Unfortunately, the results of his PhD thesis were buried in the cemetery of "secondary scientific and technical information" called VINITI and remained completely unknown to the rest of the world (the was no ${\rm arXiv}$ at the time). Wikipedia now has a comprehensive article about VINITI. 

I think the positive answer to this question follows from some results obtained in the paper The Hesselink stratification of nullcones and base change, Invent. Math., 191 (2013), 631-669, by M. Clark and A. Premet. It is proved in the paper among other things that for any nonzero nilpotent element $e\in \mathfrak{g}$ there exists an optimal cocharacter $\lambda\in X_*(G)$ for $e$ such that $e\in \bigoplus_{i\ge 2}\,\mathfrak{g}(\lambda,i)$ and $C_G(e)_{\rm red}\subseteq P(\lambda)$, where $P(\lambda)$ is the parabolic subgroup of $G$ with Lie algebra $\bigoplus_{i\ge 0}\,\mathfrak{g}(\lambda,i)$. If we choose $e\in\mathfrak{g}$ nicely then this cocharacter is obtained by base-changing one of the Dynkin cocharacters (defined over the integers). Any Borel subgroup $B$ of $P(\lambda)$ has that property that $\bigoplus_{i\ge 1}\,\mathfrak{g}(\lambda,i)\subset {\rm Lie}(B)$ and hence ${\rm Lie}(B)$ contains $e$. So any $B$ as above containing a Borel subgroup of $C_G(e)_{\rm red}\subset P(\lambda)$ would do. 

Take the nilpotent cone $\mathcal N$ in $g={\rm Lie}(G)$ and the $G$-orbit of a regular semisimple element, $h$ say. The categorical quotient $g\rightarrow g//G\cong\mathbb{A}^l$, $l={\rm rk}(G),$ is equidimensional and each of its fibres is an trreducible complete intersection and contains a unique open $G$-orbit. Since the orbit $Gh$ is closed it coincides with one of the fibres and the algebra of regular functions $\mathbb{C}[Gh]$ is just a filtered deformation of the graded algebra $\mathbb{C}[\mathcal{N}]=\mathbb{C}[g]/(f_1,\ldots,f_l)$ whose defining ideal is generated by $f_1-\lambda_1,\ldots, f_l-\lambda_l$ for some $\lambda_i\in\mathbb{C}$ (here $f_1,\ldots, f_l$is a set of free homogeneous generators for $\mathbb{C}[g]^G$). Since $G$ is reductive, we are in characteristic $0$ and the action of $G$ on $\mathbb{C}[Gh]$ is rational, we have that $\mathbb{C}[\mathcal{N}]\cong \mathbb{C}[Gh]$ as $G$-modules. So all multiplicities will be the same in both cases. However, $Gh$ is not contained in $\mathcal N$ (and vice versa). However this example does not answer the question as the stabilisers $G_x$ of regular elements $x\in g$ are not self-normalising (I have completely overlooked the extra condition on $x$ in the first reading, which implies that $N_G(G_x)=G_x$).
