I would expect that the further away a supernova is, the "longer" we observe it will be active because of an increased red shift. Objects in the universe that are further away are generally going away from us faster than objects that are close, hence the increased red shift. This increase in time due to redshift is very similar to the Doppler effect, where a siren is high pitched (and faster) when approaching you (e.g. blue shift with light), and low pitched (and slower) when going away from you (e.g. red shift with light). The faster the siren is moving away, the more the effect (both lower pitch and longer time) will be increased, likewise with light. Here are some sources that may help with what you are looking for (although I haven't been able to find a list exactly like you are looking for): $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ 

Main question: Could dark energy (the mysterious accelerating expansion of the universe) be explained by "negative gravity"? "Spin off" questions: 

This explains why objects with more mass have more gravity (e.g. each bit of mass is absorbing a small amount of space, so has gravity). The more mass you have, the more gravity you have. This explains why gravity is strong when near an object (e.g. when close to earth), and decreases inversely proportional to square distance from the object. If you imagine an expanding "spherical wave" of space moving inward, surface area of the sphere increases in relation to the square of the distance. However, the effect is dispersed over this increased surface area, hence it decreases with the square of the distance from the object. A fairly simple (but 2D vs. 3D) analogy is how when you throw a stone into water, the ripple will be strong at first, near the entry point, and then the ripple disperses as it expands into the surrounding pond. A good 3D analogy is how sound (or light) expands spherically, and is more faint the further you are away from the source. The orbit of "binary" systems, including the dynamics between the earth and moon. The earth is more massive than the moon, and is absorbing more space than the moon. Therefore, it is moving the moon toward it fairly quickly (but the moon has enough momentum that it remains in orbit vs. falling toward earth). However, the moon is also pulling on the earth, so the earth is also "falling toward the moon" a little. Again, the earth has enough momentum not to "fall into the moon". This results in mostly the moon orbiting around the earth, but the earth is also "slightly" orbiting around the moon, which would be observed as a slight wobble. This explains why large mass objects and small mass objects are affected the same by gravity. Since it is space itself that is moving, whatever is in that space will be moved accordingly. If it is an anvil, it will be moved just the same as a feather. Therefore (if it weren't for other effects such as air resistance), a feather would fall to earth the same speed as an anvil. In practice, air resistance makes the feather small much slower (but repeat the experiment on the moon, and they should hit at the same time since it has no air). This even explains why things without mass (e.g. light) are also affected by gravity. Since space itself is moving, light moves along with it. This would explain gravitational lensing, and why light cannot escape a black hole. 

I would like to know, how strong would the gravity be from the distant universe if we were somehow able to remove half of it. For example, if everything behind us did not exist, how strongly would the stuff in front of us be pulling? By distant, let us consider everything beyond 10 billion light years (e.g. remove all the closer stuff). How many G's acceleration would I experience (discounting the fact that I would be in free fall and wouldn't feel it)? 

Light may account for a small portion of dark matter, but it is unlikely to account for most/all of it. From a Wikipedia article on dark matter: $URL$ 

As a guess, I'd say you were probably looking at a group of aircraft flying together, possibly helicopters. Usually you can tell aircraft at night because the have red and green lights and anti collision lights that blink, but I have occasionally observed aircraft flying with landing lights on, and could not make out the other lights until they were closer, or they had changed direction, making them stand out.I've never seen a UFO, although I once mistook Venus for one. 

Nothing in the universe stands still. It's always on its way from somewhere to somewhere. A black hole follows a trajectory through the universe, moving from one locus in spacetime to another locus. Deep inside each black hole is a point that we've never been able to characterize.My question is, does the singularity, and possibly the powerful gravitational fields around the singularity have any measurable effect on the area of spacetime it passed through? One imagines an undeformed area of spacetime. After some time, a black hole passes through this spacetime, then moves on. Does the spacetime it passed through simply go back to being everyday, garden variety undeformed spacetime? 

When I was very young, I didn't know that the sun in the sky was just another example of the stars I saw at night. I just wasn't surrounded by people who talked about such things. Later, when I learned that the sun was also a star, I was glad to know there was a star close enough to study. The term 'sun' was used to describe our star, even before people realized it was a star. So the term 'sun' is a generic word that might follow us to the stars and be used in everyday conversation to refer to the local day stars. 'Sol' is what the Romans would say whenever they talked about the sun. Currently 'sol' is being used to refer to a rotation of a planet other than Earth in our solar system. For instance on Mars a 'sol' is about 24 hours and 38 minutes, and on Jupiter a 'sol' would be about 9 hours and 50 something minutes. There's no reason why we can't refer to a rotation of the Earth as a 'sol', but we already call it a 'day'. 

If all of the mass and energy in the universe was in a point smaller than the size of an electron at one time, why did it expand? Did it necessarily expand immediately on formation, or could it have remained in an initial state for some length of time until some phase threshold was reached? 

I live in an 'L' shaped building on the 14th floor, so I have a pretty clear view of the horizon. Up until March 20th of this year, the sun was setting behind the other wing of the building. My living room window faces roughly NW, and on March 21st, I was able to see the sun at the horizon for the first time this year. Each day, the sun will set a little further northwest until it's setting almost directly opposite my window. Then it will begin to retreat until one day in September, when it will begin to set behind the other wing of the building again.This is the first year I took note of the day that sunset was first visible, and I'm planning to note which day is the last day I can see the sun set. 

Mercury rotates three times for every two revolutions around the Sun, apparently due to a gravitational resonance with the Sun.Venus takes about 225 days to rotate, and rotates in the opposite direction of any of the inner planets. Maybe because its extreme nature makes it ornery.Earth rotates once every 24 hours, a condition caused by the tidal interaction between Earth and its Moon. It's believed that the Earth was rotating about once every 5 hours before the theorized collision with a Mars sized coorbiting object referred to as Theia.Mars shows no signs of a similar collision. Its two moons appear to be asteroids that were captured from the asteroid belt. So how did Mars come to have a day so close to the length of an Earth day? 

A tidal day is the MEAN time between successive meridian transits of the Moon. (This is sometimes called called a lunar day, a term that should be deprecated for use in this sense, because it is also used for the length of a day on the Moon and should be reserved for the latter meaning to avoid ambiguity.) Its length exceeds a mean solar day of 24 hours by X minutes, which is also the (mean) time-length by which moonrise (or its meridian transit) is later each day than it was yesterday. (Here is an animation by NOAA demonstrating this principle.) The exact value of X is variously given in different places, ranging from about 48 to 52. However, I cannot find anywhere an authoritative source detailing the "correct" way to calculate X. Does anyone know of an authoritative method of calculating X, and/or can anyone comment on the three methods given below. (1) I have a personal theory that puts X at about 48.763 minutes, but I am uneasy about how correct the underlying logic of it is, which is this: Consider two successive conjunctions (C1 and C2) of the MEAN sun and MEAN moon. At C1, the Sun's azimuth and the Moon's azimuth will, at ALL places on Earth, be the same, and, although this is no longer true for the rest of the lunation, it will once again be true at C2. This is analogous to two clocks: Clock 1 (the MEAN sun) keeps correct time, while clock 2 (the MEAN moon) loses a constant amount of time (X minutes) each day. Since the two clocks agree at C1 and at C2, clock 2 must have lost exactly 24 hours (1440 minutes) during the intervening synodic lunation, whose length (Ln) is 29.5305891203704 days. This suggests that X (the number of minutes that clock 2 loses per day) = (1440 / Ln) = 48.763. However, I feel uneasy about this logic for this reason: If C1 occurs on April 1 at 06:00:00, UTC, and it is then sunrise at Tema, Ghana (on the prime meridian, near the equator), C2 will be on April 30 at 18:44:03, UTC, and that will not be sunrise at Tema; it will be dusk there, and it will be sunrise at east longitude 169Â°. Does this negate the above logic suggesting that X = 24 hours / Ln? (2) Another method for calculating X suggested to me is this: It is based on the Moon's sidereal period (Ld), 27.321661 days. The MEAN angular distance along its orbit travelled by the Moon each day is (360Â° / Ld) = 13.17636Â° (which equates to a mean orbital speed of about 0.55Â° per hour.) So, each day, the Earth must rotate 360Â° plus an extra 13.17636Â° to point the same meridian back at the Moon again. The Earth's rotational speed is (360Â° / 24 hrs) = 15Â° per hour. At that rate, the extra time needed by the Earth to rotate those extra 13.17636Â° is [(13.17636/360) * 24] = 0.878424 hour = 52.7 minutes. (3) I argue that even if method (2) is right in principle, it requires two amendments, because: (a) The Earth rotates 360Â° in a sidereal day, which is nearly 4 minutes shorter than 24 hours, in which time the Earth rotates nearly 361Â°, or, more precisely, 360.98565Â°. (The fraction in the latter value is obtained from the average daily portion of the Earth's orbit: 360Â°/365.2422 days = 0.985647Â° per day.) (An animation demonstrating why this is so is here.) So, the extra time needed by the Earth to rotate those extra 13.17636Â° is: [(13.17636/360.98565)*24] = 0.8760 hours = 52.56 minutes. (b) Furthermore, in those extra 52.56 minutes, the Moon has moved on in its orbit by nearly another half a degree. More precisely, it is (360/27.321661)*(52.56/1440) = 0.48094Â°. So the calculation should be: [(13.17636+0.48094)/360.98565)*24] = 0.90800 hours = 54.48 minutes. So we have three different methods of calculating X, yielding values of 48.763, 52.56 or 54.48 minutes. Comments anyone? Either endorsements or criticisms of any of these three methods will be gratefully accepted.
