I'm not from Canada and have no idea about Canada. Here in Europe however, in the countries I've lived in, there need to be the same notice periods for the employer and employee. Now, it may be different for contractors. However, that big a difference appears unattractive for you, so unless other conditions (money, project) are magnificent, I would try to negotiate. Before you do, however, try to understand the company's expectations and how long they would need you. If your quitting early would cause them a lot of trouble, avoid accepting. Don't burn bridges. Normally, in such contracts you have provisions on sanctions: what will happen if you don't start your job at a specific moment, etc. If you don't have them, law from your country frequently applies. 

Go to HR and complain. This makes sense especially if you have anything to prove the harassment, e.g. emails or any other sources in writing or witnesses (although these can be unreliable and are probable not to support to you to avoid problems) Avoidance. There's this great book by Robert I. Sutton about dealing with assholes in the workplace. His main advice is to avoid them because the probability you will win is tiny. Other advice include moving in the organisation. Just think how you can avoid dealing with him altogether and do everything you can to reach that. 

I think there are two issues here. This assumes that you are not to blame for the issue, i.e. you just present facts to your boss in a factual way, don't play politics, and you are actually right in what you propose: 

I don't think the linked question is the same. The question from 6 years ago seems to suggest that the interviewer was trying to test the interviewee's reactions (by repeating the same question many times in a very confrontational way, etc.). It seems to have been a typical stress interview. I've had that before, but the situation I describe in this thread is different. In this case I'm convinced the interviewers were actually mistaken. Moreover, my question is not, "how to tell a interviewer that he is wrong", my question is how to react to this kind of situation - whether it makes sense to tell them or what better alternatives there are. 

If adult people forget about meetings and it's not a one-time or one-person thing they are either totally unreliable/ unmotivated/ not good enough or - more probably - you planned your huddles wrongly. For example most people can work more efficiently in the morning. So if you plan a huddle at 9 or 10:00 you risk disrupting their normal "flow". This has negative consequences for you - some will forget about meetings, and for their efficiency - after a disruption people need some time to focus again. Many people also have most work in the morning. Try asking your coworkers if their workload during the day varies and why they don't appear on time instead of buying a gong. Also think about the huddle itself, whether it makes sense to keep it, what purpose it serves and whether the organisation is efficient (e.g. maybe you invite too many people and the info shared is not relevant to many participants). 

The laptop is very quiet You explain the interviewee that you would like to take some notes on your laptop and ask them whether they are ok with that You are able to take notes and think at the same time. I once had an interview where the interviewer was taking notes on his laptop but evidently he was so focused on typing that he didn't understand my answers. 

You apply for a job at a huge company Then after just a few days you get an email "I'm interested! Let's have a call! When are you available?" You reply within 6 h You get no reply for 5 days 

When working for a company it's important to develop the ability also to detach oneself and not care. In a positive sense! If you're trying to change something nobody else wants to change, you will end up hated by the colleagues and the management. So focus on what your task is. Flag and inform - but let people who are in fact responsible for taking decisions take them. It doesn't matter if you are right - I know plenty of people, myself included, who ended up fired despite being right - or because of being right. 

Some candidates like to know what to expect. If you don't list fluent English as a requirement, you want to have the candidate prepared, so that they are not surprised. It shows some respect towards candidates to provide them with info on the process. 

Don't give him your email address unless you want him to bother you with emails, which is almost as bad as phoning someone. 

*Mind you: Of course I'm talking about the most probable scenario here. It can always happen that the recruiter loves ballet and you would score +100 points by adding that. 

Propose him to have a skype call instead. Tell him you wouldn't feel ok for him to invest so much time and effort into this meeting. But then it's his decision whether he's coming or not and if he's decided there's not much you can do. 

Asking for this data is a trend that probably came to Europe from the US. Applying for jobs 5 years ago I was never asked to provide this info. Applying last year, several companies did ask me to provide the salary data and didn't want to accept that I would never make it available to them. By making this data available you can only lose. Not to mention that for me at least, it's a huge violation of privacy. Companies won't provide you infos on what the average salary on the given level is or how much you would get on different career levels ("Dear company, could you please provide me some paychecks from every level?"). So why do they expect you to provide this info? So accept that the company is probably not one you would ever want to work for. It doesn't respect people's privacy and doesn't show respectful attitude towards applicants. It's also probable that it discriminates - because obviously this data is taken to offer you just a bit more than you had, which means lower salaries for women. 

I've been working with this line manager for a bit over 6 months. He's my boss from the very beginning. He's a horrible micromanager, which is a problem in itself. However here I would like to ask about a different problem. He doesn't trust me. For example, he asks me to create a report on something in an analytics software we use. I create it and send it to him. Then we meet someone specialised in the area of the report and my boss asks the person whether they know how to create the same report. I say: "Hey boss, I know how to create it. I actually sent it to you just yesterday!". The specialist asks how I created it, I describe it, the specialist confirms I've done that correctly and there's no other way to do that and they would do that exactly the same way. 3 days later I learn my boss actually went to another specialist and asked them to organise a meeting on how to create this report! I learn about that since he actually invits me to this meeting because he wants me to learn how to create this report. Basically he expects me to spend more than an hour listening how this report should be created. Of course I contacted this specialist too and asked them whether they have any other way to create the report apart from the way I'm using. The answer was "No! There's definitely no other way to create this report!". This can last for months and include plenty of people. I know this sounds as if one of us were totally crazy. I can tell you here, the report was 100% correct. When creating it for the first times I contacted several specialists, including those mentioned above, in order to be 100% sure I create it correctly (and yes, of course I mentioned to my boss that I had). At the beginning I thought: he doesn't know me, I need to convince him I know what I'm doing. But it has been 6 months. And he does that with each and every topic, not just this one report. And I'm actually an experienced hire, not a recent graduate. Actually in many cases I could teach the people he contacts to confirm that I do something correctly how to do things, as I have more experience. What ways are there to build trust or just deal with this situation better because for now my work is simply incredibly inefficient and I've been feeling extremely stressed out because of that?
