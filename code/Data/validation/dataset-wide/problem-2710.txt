I disagree with the answers above. Either / or corresponds unequivocally, in English, to an exclusive or (XOR). The XOR function returns true only if P and Q have opposite values (T/F, F/T). Hence the statement "You hair is not short" returns true. The problem was merely in the translation into formula, becaused it used "OR"; but it is obvious from the question that it should have been formulated as XOR. 

That could be a fallacy of the "excluded middle" since practical experience is complicated and things cannot be open and shut. There is no "quantum shift" (or "slipping") from one absolute proposition to the opposed one. In more detail, a key distinction exists between responsibility and liability. Responsibility is a much broader concept that covers present (doing one's intended or expected actions), future (predicting, preparing, etc.), and past (assuming causality and consequences of one's actions). When one introduces fault (and hence the liability of a person to repair the damage), then a number of logical pre-requisites are typically required [philosophers of law or law experts do not hesitate to complete or amend]: 

The underlying question is one of political philosophy: why societies have regulations, controls and punishment for offenders. It also raises the question of what a "good" and "bad" regulation is. I do not hope to answer or even circumscribe the question. But if we watch carefully how laws are worded, the lawmakers make an assumption beforehand that their laws will be violated. This can be seen in the clauses of a law that specify enforcement measures (e.g. taken by a court and applied by police) or that specify penalties for offenders (such as reparation of damage, fines or prison). More specifically: 

In what way did Peirce think the 'thing-in-itself' acted as limit to human understanding? How much of this did he borrow from Kant and if he diverged from Kant, in what way? 

It's important to recognize that prayer, like other forms of communication, is embedded in an attitude of the speaker. Rarely is a communicative act ever a simple relaying of information. Instead, communicative acts serve implicit and more critical functions. For example, my relaying the information of my previous heart problems to my doctor serves not only as an act of literal communication but as an act of therapy. My plead to a doctor to assist me not only relays to her my current status but opens a door where I myself, through my communication, am welcoming her to help me. So while it is true that there is a certain redundancy in performing a communicative act with an all-knowing entity since said entity already knows what it is we are trying to communicate, the redundancy really only holds a significance considering the literal information being relayed. What saves most communication from being redundant is that it fosters community. Prayer is no different. The theist would say that prayer's main function is not to relay information to God, but to welcome God's intervening in our lives, specifically through the attitude of pleading (St. Augustine states "prayer is a petition" (De Uni., vi. 14)). It is also important to keep in mind that prayer isn't necessarily to God alone. As St. Aquinas states: 

Necessary means that something is required to achieve a goal. Sufficient means that is all you need to reach your objective. In your case: 

From a scientific point of view you can only rely on statistics. For example, if you were to toss a coin we all agree that it would not be possible to toss the coin an infinite number of times. The purpose of statistics is, precisely, to determine a sufficient number of experiments to infer some kind of information about a phenomenon under observation. For example, in the case of the coin, you may want to use the Bayes' Theorem to determine whether it is likely or not that a fair coin would produce the sequence of heads and tails you are observing. From statistics you can determine the number of tosses (or experiments) you need to make sure the probability you compute is sufficiently reliable. As your demands, in terms of reliability, get closer and closer to 100%, the number of tosses you need to make increases to infinity. Your argument about the fact that an all head sequence is always possible with some positive probability is correct. In fact, it does happen with probability one simply because you may model the system as a Markov chain with recurrent states; indeed, any sequence of finite length will eventually occur. However, this is not the point. The point is, precisely, what you said: different events do have some probabilities to occur. This is the key observation statisticians make use of to determine the size of a sufficiently large sample they can possibly use to derive the statistics they need (in your case, the probability that the coin is fair given a sequence of coin tosses). We know that, in principle, any prediction might be wrong even if the confidence is 99.9% but in practice, statistics is all you can use. 

I will give an answer from an applied sciences or engineering viewpoint: it depends on what exactly you are trying to achieve. Are you trying to simply group them together? In that case, the possibility expressed in your "hypotheses" have already been experimented with (and a mathematician could likely provide a rigorous demonstration), so they would rather count as facts. The function of a hypothesis is to provide a statement that you are going to test. If you say: 

The Hippocratic Oath is considered as a moral yardstick of the medical profession. Hence a discussion on that point would have to take it into consideration. Though it would have to be taken in its entirety, I excerpt the following parts (in its classical form): "I will apply dietetic measures for the benefit of the sick according to my ability and judgment; I will keep them from harm and injustice." "Whatever houses I may visit, I will come for the benefit of the sick, remaining free of all intentional injustice, of all mischief [...]." 

It depends how one interprets this statement. Offhand, "it's not the time or place for that" is very vague (in the worst case, it could be a non-sequitur). On the other hand, the "time" argument could legitimately be interpreted e.g. as: 

The "handshake" ("are you there?"): it ensures (for telecom devices) that the other device is still reachable through the line, and in a conversation or speech, that your audience is still paying attention. So the real question, is: "Do I still have a communication?". In the extreme, whatever one asks is irrelevant; a sentence ("d'you see what I mean?"), a simple word ("yeah?") or even a question mark ("?") would suffice. The maieutic question: the purpose of the question is to make the audience think about something (relatively obvious), so they indirectly come to a realization ("aha!"). 

We simply can't. We can't even prove that the Universe was created yesterday along with all memories of the past. We can't prove the Universe isn't just a run of a simulation (see the Simulation Hypothesis). If you put it this way, nothing can actually be proven. 

Killing is not sufficient, you need killing plus something else. Your example is not a good one because, killing, by definition means that someone is going to be dead. You should use some other verb. 

I think it's hard to say. If you believe that mathematics has been discovered, you must assume that "something" is out there, something we can interact with, of which we have been unable to prove existence so far. However, even assuming that there are ideas out there, I believe that there is no reason to think that humans should be, in any way, able to understand them. As David Deutsch famously said, the fact that we understand the laws of Nature, is pretty much like saying that you land on another planet, and find aliens completely able to speak to you in english. Last but not least, it is possible that our models of how the Universe works are completely wrong. Hence, we are talking about ideas derived from our models that may be, ultimately, way off the truth. 

Rather than a philosophy I think it has a darwinian explanation. Being altruistic towards your peers is an incentive for them to help you out when you need it. 

In addition to what has been said, I propose a different slant: from a logical or mathematical viewpoint, a "flip-flop" between two or more answers is a problem only if you decide that it is so. You could enumerate all possible answers and that set might be considered a correct answer (or you could consider some form of "mean" between the answers). But you obviously want one answer. But if you introduce time, it is not a problem at all: there can be, at any time t, only one answer. If it flip-flops, it becomes an "oscillation" (and note that if it seems a "paradox" to us, it is because we need to enumerate successive different answers as we go along with our calculations, something that requires time to do). Hence the problem becomes "robustly" solvable if you introduce time into your model, as well as cause and effect (and feedback rules). And indeed, if we assign a time value of 1 to each computation of a proposition in the Liar's paradox (traditionally, modelled) we see a flip-flop as the clock is ticking. The simplest application of "time" would be, of course, a system of time precedence between your propositions, stopping at the first one that gives a relevant answer. With automatic rules engines working on the basis of "first fit", a later contradicting proposition would be ignored. But that would remove the challenge in your question. Another one (slightly more complex in the beginning, but perhaps less complicated in the end), is to define more accurately the propositions A, B and C: in other words they would be functions of other properties which could vary over time. So we would have A(t), B(t) and C(t). Then we would have to define the rules of cause and effect between these properties (principle of feedback). The result could be a single, unequivocal answer, or it could flip-flop between two or more answers (oscillation), or it could become chaotic (which is generally unwanted) or it would diverge to infinity (which when applied to physics is often synonymous of "breaking apart"), etc. That requires, of course, a slightly expanded type of mathematics than your formal model (though its basics would be the same): as a matter of fact it is simply the mathematical models of digital circuits. But perhaps the results might be more intuitive in the end. 

Aquinas is not only restating that prayer serves a petitionary purpose (which would exempt prayer from your charge of redundancy), but he is also presenting a more global perspective of prayer (i.e., as an essentially communal act that is performed in the presence and for the persuasion of both angels and saints who are not all-knowing). Another Objection to Prayer A more potent objection to prayer would be to question the logic behind suggesting that God can become 'closer' to a person through prayer. Isn't God omnipresent? But even here I think the theist has the resemblance of an answer. It is not God who needs to become closer to man but man that needs to become closer to God. This logic still might be questioned if we think of 'closer' in a distance sense, which presupposes that there is some single, absolute space between the two limited points. But for the theist, they normally adopt a distinction between God and man comparable to the difference between actuality and potentiality, or absolute and relative, in which case any 'distance' is not one between equals but one between a master and a servant. As such, the act of becoming 'closer' to God is similar to an effect becoming actualized, or darkness being lit. When thought about in this way, the act of becoming closer does not need to imply a limitation to God's power nor a redundancy in light of God's power.
