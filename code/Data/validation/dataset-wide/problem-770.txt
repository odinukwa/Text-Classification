It really is that simple. Just set a variable to equal whatever starting MJD you want to be zero and count earth days between events. 

For a more analytical and much much less philosophical version of an answer than MacUserT's, here it is. According to MacUserT, 

Barnard 68 is the first thing that comes to mind for me, it is a little over 10' across and is opaque in the visible spectrum. 

Approximately greater than or equal to $2\times10^7$ years. This approximate number comes from Stellar Structure and Evolution by Dina Prialnik The contraction from nebula phase takes about $10^5$ years, and the red giant envelope dispersion takes about another $10^5$ years. Neither of which impact the timescale due to the two orders of magnitude longer MS lifetime. 

I think you're asking, "If we know an object's shape, can we determine if it is in in hydrostatic equilibrium?" If so, one might wonder if astronomers classify basketballs or ball bearings as being in hydrostatic equilibrium, since they're so spherical. Below about 100 km in radius, the answer is in general no. Given some population of randomly lumpy objects (like asteroids), some of them will be close to the shape of a sphere purely on accident. The composition matters too -- an object of this size made of hydrogen gas would assume a spherical shape from hydrostatic equilibrium, but an object made of rock might not (like Mathilde below). We could make better predictions given detailed knowledge of the materials and environment of the object, but this is not always possible, as you mentioned. For small objects, intermolecular and atomic forces dominate gravity. 

Like @James K said, the MJD is simply a count, so you can set some arbitrary date to be and go from there. For example, take today's MJD date and say there was one event today: 

The two galaxies formed a great distance apart from one another, almost a billion years after the big bang. They are as close today as they have ever been. 

Planetary orbits are a little different, I'm not exactly sure how to state the process for their precession without waving my hands about the room, so I won't attempt it. However, I will say that, as all things in the universe, I am sure the ecliptic is a dynamic system unto itself. About the ecliptic (dashed line) and the galactic plane (spotted strip) see the attached image. 

While cleaning my desk, I found an out of date star map (puts the cleaning into perspective, huh?) where the Scutum constellation is still referred to as Scutum Sobiescianum). This is the original name Johannes Hevelius gave it in 1684 My map is (unfortunately) modern and comes from the 2nd half of the 20th century. It's a Polish one so it's not odd for it to still use the traditional name. The main illustration of the Scutum article in Polish Wikipedia happens to do so as well. 

The closest I've seen to what you mention in your question are wide-angle binoculars, the like of Vixen SG 2.1x42. There are other similar instruments available, often of Russian or Chinese (like this one) production. They have low magnifications and are examples of Galilean binoculars. 

The real answer to your question is ... No. The reason is that when measuring the distance to a star, any star, you are either looking at a star within our own galaxy, or you're doing something wrong. This means that you're not looking at objects far enough away for any possible space-time curvature to be detectable. That is the reason "simple" trigonometry works, and why these distances are universally used. 

I'm sure there could be something much larger out there, but like I said, this was the first to come to mind. 

Anything else regarding the images ie: stacking of filter combinations, are secondary and rarely required for any science case. The funny thing is, these are common for any CCD image with a long exposure, so the space telescopes bit only adds more chance for cosmic ray interactions. Enjoy 

In a typical position in a globular cluster (maybe halfway between center and edge), there'd be many more bright stars in the sky due to the star density. These would be distributed unevenly in the sky, with more light coming from the center of the globular cluster. Depending on the globular cluster's orbit, we might be able to see the Milky Way face-on. This would be beautiful and would take up a large fraction of the sky. However, it wouldn't be particularly bright--the apparent magnitude would be $\approx -3$, the brightness of Jupiter. If our alien eyes were good at discerning wavelengths, the sky would seem redder. Globular clusters have many old stars (more red), and very few massive stars (fewer blue) since they are not sites of active star formation. 

They don't have a fixed-size exit pupil and you can gain about 1.8 mag above what you can see with a naked eye (based on a review from a Polish astronomy forum). With the field of view of about 25 degrees, this is an experience somewhat (to put it mildly) different from what you describe. However, it's enough to see quite a large piece of the sky at the same time and is probably the closest you can get to star-gazing goggles. To make it easier to picture, 25 degrees is approximately the angular size of the Big Dipper, from one end of the bowl to the tip of the handle. Due to their size and wide FOV, these binos are also known to be used in the same manner as goggles. Pictured below is a pair of Kasai WideBino 28 in a wearable, rubber casing. 

Using a mass-luminosity relation will give you a decent estimate on the mass (probably within a magnitude), but as usual, the more data you have on the stars, the better your estimate will be. There are a lot of sources of error (for example, age and metallicity), and whatever errors on your luminosity measurement will be propagated to your mass measurement. A compilation of various relations like this is given in this paper, for various evolution stages. If you don't know various parameters of your stars (like age), it might be good to try out a variety of possible values for these models, and see how it impacts your estimates. 

IAU's official website mentions that the names of the 88 current constellations (Scutum included) were standardised during the organizations inaugural meeting in 1922 and apparrently haven't been changed ever since. 

The beads of bright light can be seen thanks to the Moons rugged topography. They're called Baily's beads in honor of an English astronomer who explained the phenomenon, Francis Baily. In the photograph you posted, you can also see Solar prominences. It's plasma ejected into the corona. Its temperature is lower than that of the coronal plasma and it emits more visible light. 

I know the name of the constellation has been changed but I can't find any information on who did it and when. I suppose it must have been the IAU (International Astronomical Union) but I have no idea regarding the time of the change. When was the English name of the constellation officially changed and who did it? 

Once you get to a certain size of object, it becomes much easier to make a prediction about hydrostatic equilibrium. This is still very much context-dependent, and you still get complications from material composition, temperature, etc. However, atomic binding forces have some fixed strength, but gravity scales like mass. Given ordinary astrophysical materials, we can be very sure that a body like Jupiter is under hydrostatic equilibrium. You can make some order of magnitude estimates by assuming that the atomic interaction energy must be at least as large as the thermal energy (Hughes and Cole 1995). If you check out equation 5 of that paper, you'll see an explicit expression for a radius that divides spherical objects and nonspherical ones. At some mass, the binding atomic energy becomes dwarfed by the gravitational potential, and you always get a spherical object. tl;dr -- small objects no, big objects yes, medium objects may require detailed modeling.
