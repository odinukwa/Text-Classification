The most basic answer to this question is that it presents a threat to the ego, which lives from the endless quest to control the world and secure itself with comforting narrative (confabulations) about existence. The buddhist concept of no-self is very simple: it is the idea that the thing one calls "self" is no more than the minds artificial construction of a narrator for the five aggregates (skandhas) of form (or matter or body) (rupa), sensations (or feelings, received from form) (vedana), perceptions (samjna), mental activity or formations (sankhara), and consciousness (vijnana). No-self (anattā) and emptiness (sunyata) are concepts that represent the Heraclitian nature of existence, meaning empty of intrinsic existence and nature. It is the mind that gives self and form permanence and specific "natures". And much as Hume saw in the breakdown of internal and external impressions the mechanisms of the formation of habit, buddhist thought breaks down experience to its fundamental components as a way to free mental representations of false impressions about the of one's existence and causal attributions we make of the external world. But ironically, from a western (abrahamic) perspective, one may not see such a concept as being something promoting of freedom. The very idea of letting go of the self provokes anxiety for many, so the idea of non-self implies for them a void/nothingness, which is not at all what the concept of Anatta refers to. Anatta is not so much a non-existence. It is more a concept of non-adding-to. This Thanisarro Bhikku quote sums it nicely: 

He was here not interested in mathematics for the sake of mathematics, but for a sort of extraction of the problematics underpinning a mathematical idea. He would not consider measures or functions as tied to particular problems to be objects of great interest in philosophical development. It is the formalizaion of a problem that is of concern --that which sets the stage for an answer, a work, a line of inquiry, even entire schools of thought etc--. The problems one sets out to answer all presuppose a problematic. That's why someone like Deleuze would focus on things expressed in Leibniz that mathematicians would not see any value in. He's not a mathematician, but a philosopher. From an idea standpoint the employment of the discussion around Leibniz's use of dx & dy is closer to what Leibniz himself did in his development of differential calculus and the idea contagion of the concept of infinitesimals with the development of monads. With Deleuze's particular case he was addressing Kant's framework of making Ideas subject to external constraints. The thought looked at here was that of something being undetermined, determinable and effectively determined (dx,dy)/(dx/dy), (values of dx/dy). Or put differently, understanding the idea of differentials under 1) a principle of determinability; 2) a principle of reciprical determination and 3) a principle of complete determination. A 'differential' for Leibniz under these principles is very different than the Kantian approach that precedes by via representation (or sub-representation). I believe the term "finitist" only makes sense in the context of this history of mathematical discussion around infinitesimals which is not discussed so much in the book they cite above, Difference & Repetition, but in the later book on Leibniz. The SEP author is correct that the history of mathematician's treatment of Leibniz's ideas isn't in any sense lost on him, it just had no relevance at all to the discussion on the history of philosophical ideas being had in the book. 

The concept of duration is in its most simple presentation qualitative multiplicity or the fusion of this experience of nowness with the those that follow. What is commonly called "time" isn't duration but a quantified measure of duration that isn't itself derivative of duration but spatialization (which also gets referred to as "simultaneity"): i.e. what is counted with clock-time. The importance of the concept for Bergson was to not just be able to reference discrete, quantified or quantifiable multiplicity, but continuity, subjective experience and that which escapes extensive forms of measure. The two sides are never truly separate in actuality, but what we reference tends to either priviledge one or the other, which for him presents endless problems in how humans explain and reference reality. You don't have ever one without the other. Simultaneity presupposes (requires) duration, but a measure of simultaneity doesn't account for duration. Extensivity presupposes (requires) intensivity, but measures of extensive multiplicities don't account for qualitative dynamics. Hope this helps. 

The principal of ehipassiko teaches that you are to believe nothing on authority. You verify for yourself if something is true or not. The principle of Amoha (a negation of Moha) teaches now that we've avoided external delusion, be vigilant of those varieties of delusion which rise from within. So to answer the question posed (as it relates to buddhist practice), yes it is a continual possibility. But going through (not around or above) that tension, or the working with what are called the "unwholesome roots" of kamma (Lobha, Dhosa, and Moha) are inextricably part of the the buddhist practice, at least as I'm aware of it from Theravadan and Vajrayanan teaching. It's not an external concern, but one central to the "truth" being sought, insofar as that truth is individual. 

I don't have a clear picture of Taussig's discussion of this topic as I have not read him in a long time, but your closest bet to getting a Deleuzian response to this question would be via the work of Eduardo Viveiros de Castro, particularly in Cannibal Metaphysics. He does perhaps the most or any contemporary author to flesh out the transformation Deleuze makes from his very early discussions of symbolism (such as in the book Kant's Critical Philosophy) and the transformation he makes of it in Mille Plateaux in the discussion of "becoming". But Viveiros de Castro isn't approaching it so much from the philosophical side of it but for its implications for the practice of anthropology. I would also actually disagree with the statement that something like "symbolic restructuring" isn't discussed with them. But given that this is not a philosophical in nature, it isn't discussed in their books together. You'd have to look in Guattari's solo works to see how an entire art of dispositional restructuring is proposed. The language and the concepts are different from what you'd see in someone like Taussig or any other writer I can think of, but he's talking about essentially the same thing -- how to change the way one relates to the mind, mental events, mental content etc. For me it's most clear in Guattari's Cartographies schizoanalytiques. 

An quick easy example is the study of exchange from Marcel Mauss to Claude Levi-Strauss to someone like Eduardo Viveiros de Castro: 1) Mauss operating with positivist epistemology of "social facts" influenced mostly by Emile Durkheim whose methodology is largely that of Comte. 2) Levi Strauss operating with a structuralist ontology of "social facts" influenced largely by things happening in linguistics like Ferdinand de Saussure and Roman Jakobsky, Malinkoswkian functionalism and Hegel. 3) Viveiros de Castro operating with a post-structuralist ontology of "social facts" influenced primarily by Levi Strauss, Marilyn Strathern and Gilles Deleuze. Three perspectives on the same "social fact" of exchange in the primitive cultures come out with vastly different observations about the nature of the social facts under observation. 1) Mauss sees in exchange the presentation of gifts and counter-gifts and sees in this practice something common to all human societies 2) Levi-Strauss sees in exchange in primative societies solely exchange, discounting the subjective presentation of experience to arrive at a "theory of indigenous reality" not to be found in the perspectives of the indigenous themselves 3) Viveiros de Castro sees in exchange neither gift nor exchange (in any traditional sense) but always a transformation of the parties that come together for the "transaction", a transformation for mututal survival. And he also sees in the analyses of the anthropologist not impartial observers relating the facts and tales of natives, but participants in the transformation of facts and tales that are no longer what they were to the natives. The ontological and epistemological presuppositions of each are radically different, and changing sometimes consciously because of philosophical influences (i.e. Viveiros de Castro) but more often from influences from the field of study itself. Unspoken presuppositions. They also each have evolving relationships with science. Mauss and Levi-Strauss both attempting in their own way to provide methodological precision to their "sciences". Viveiros de Castro taking a step back at the recognition of major flaws in the reductivism and non-impartiality of the previous two anthropological or sociological perspectives. To the question "how do these people live?" the answers are relatively similar, but to the question of "how do these people see and understand their world?" or put differently "what is the world and reality lives by x population" the answers could not be more radically opposed to each other. I use these three anthropologists just as examples because of both their popularity, but they are representative of three large movements/shifts within the field of anthropology itself since the mid-1800's to present that mirrors dozens of other well known anthropologists in their orbits. 

Foucault's own thoughts for or against things that he writes about, are often difficult to unravel. His first goal in writing is to allow us as readers to see something clearly which at first is not particularly clear. For example with the recent publication of his lectures, particularly, "Society Must be Defended", "Security, Territory, Population", "The Government of Self and Others" and "On the Government of the Living" one sees with great detail his concerns with the material developments and evolutions in the exercise of and contest of power, not just at the level of the State, but as diffused throughout our societies. Where his opinions really come to fore are in interviews, especially when being pressed for his perspective. So there's an answer to your question, but I wouldn't advocate looking for it in his books. Insofar as power is never one-sided in his perspective, it applies to the dominated as much as to a dominator. In each field of genealogy or archeology of statements and events that he goes into, there's never much of an reason to say "yes this was good" "that was bad". That type of evaluation becomes irrelevant to his overall objective of letting you know the origins of where you are today. So he engages, Plato, Artistotle, Cicero, Polibyus etc on their views on democracy, republic compromises etc, but it is to explore both the context of the relations of power in their epochs but also the types of knowledge they developed to deal with those concrete situations. So with everything he approached, there are situations, and how subjects deal with those situations. Its a massive project for the articulation of spaces of freedom. So would he advocate democracy? He would ask what one means by that term. As he himself states in an interview, "you can’t provide a definitive formula for the optimal exercise of power." Part of his perspective is that it's not a question simply for him to decide. Power-relations are negotiated in the moment, in society, BY society, not just any singular individual, and always in our every-day present. What is, or what becomes, are the results of "relations of force" a la Nietzsche. It's a somewhat vague response that never satisfied many of his peers and critics while he was alive. But it's something he doesn't veer from. He sees a great danger in trying to prescribe for the world particular a priori formuli and spent the entirety of his philosophical career fighting against such a priori's. His ultimate goal is freedom: In an interview from Nov. 1980: 

Zen as a practice concerns the persons relationship with being (I'm intentionally using small 'b' here). The thinking mind is an aspect of being, and what is dealt with in western philosophy is in particular the "conceptual". Zen doesn't take as its direct object conceptual thought. From it's point of view your relationship with conceptual thinking will necessarily be transformed through its transformation of your being. So to answer your question, there's two aspects: 1) Zen as a practice transforms western logocentrism indirectly by changing you as the entity in dialogue with it; but 2) Zen does not have as its direct object the objects of western philosophy so there is always the opportunity for it to have a enriching symbiosis with it. The discursive and non-discursive presuppose each other as does the conceptual and non-conceptual. The non-discursive and non-conceptual is massively underdeveloped in the West and the capacity to return to or to into into it is something that always transforms the person with such a capacity. Could it transform western philosophy in any major way? I don't have an answer here but the question to ask yourself is how are the traditional questions of western philosohy canonized and institutionalized and how are they challenged? What constitutes a "problem" of philosophical relevance? All of this is very culturally situated. And a zen approach to concepts challenges these traditional questions one poses as of philosophical relevance. So these domains tend to remain separate at an institutional level although plenty of us can be involved in both simultaneously. 

In an attempt to give you bare conceptual definitions: Dictatorship : a form of governance in which absolute power is exercised by a sole authority Democracy : a form of governance in which power is divided to the demos (the people) Communism : a form of organization of an oikos in which one privileges the production of value that is shared in "common" (as opposed to exclusivizable forms of products, values and priviledges). 

As Mauro points out, you'd want to find the central works of thinkers like Ferdinand de Saussure, Roman Jakobson, Claude Levi-Strauss, and Roland Barthes. The best text around summarizing what they all have in common and the major contributions of this school would be Deleuze's "How do we Recognize Structuralism?". 

The precise definition given for the Event evolves from Being & Event up to Logic of Worlds. So depending on what period one is reading of him, the presentation of this concept may be more or less complex. The most complete definition, given in Logic of Worlds presupposes different levels of "happenings" (my term not his) in a World (at a site): 

While he's using the term "emptiness" here, suññatā, it is the very same principle only applied to the activity of the skandas (the breakdown of mental and sensory experience that one calls and considers a solidified "self"). Perhaps another parallel one could make is with constructivism and the contemporary reaction to the "Death of Man" in the work of Foucault. By deconstructing the idea of an ahistorical, autonomous subject as sovereign originator of meaning, untainted by his own particular historical and socio-political context, he made a lot of people upset. Self ideas are the most sacred ones we have. I think it's perhaps only natural that the challenging of them (whatever ones socio-cultural background) be somewhat sensitive. I'm not sufficiently familiar with the use of the concept's use in Hindu/Vedic thought to comment on it, but in buddhism it is applied to literally everything as a means to combat the human tendency to cling to representations and ideas. 

The question to start with, from a philosophical standpoint, is what exactly is reincarnation, and define it precisely. Particular people use the concept differently and mean entirely different things with it. After you have a clear concept defined you can say what qualities are necessary for it. If staying in alignment with empiricism and verifiable propositions about the world one inhabits is important then the concept has to not only maintain logical consistency but must equally meet sufficient and necessary conditions of existence for the physical world. If those constraints are not important to ones "philosophy" (or perspective), then the concept can take all manner of possible descriptions and explanations, which I would not be equipped to discuss. The concept of reincarnation that I am familiar with from a 20th century vajrayana perspective is summed up this way by Kenchen Thrangu Rinpoche:
