This is not the same year as your bike, so there are some differences: the downtube is curved, the brakes are more like V-Brakes (bosses are lower than the rims) rather then the 990s (like yours, up by the tire). Now lets focus on the similarities: 3/8" axles, seatstay/chainstay taper at the rear welds, seatstay/toptube welds at the seattube, the style of the pinch in the chainstay tube by the sprocket. Now for the parts that could have been changed, but most likely not (any why I think it is an XGames contract bike) the seatpost, seatguts, reflector, seat clamp, brake lever are all the same, and the seat on your bike says "FS20" which is not the brand of the bike but rather the brand of the parts maker. Contracted bikes will often use the same parts company even if they change frame welders. Now let look at why I think the frame was contracted with WeThePeople: 

Or a more specific tool similar to this one: This particular one has 8 prongs where yours has 6, so check to make sure the tool you get will match the make and model of your bottom bracket set before you go this route. You can also take your bike into a bike shop. They will almost always just pop it off for you, if it won't take too long. Maybe charge you $5, but in the shop I worked at, we would have done something this simple for free (and we had all those tools already. Remember, they are trying to compete with online shops now, so their biggest selling point is "in person" customer service) // EDIT - Actually, it might look more like this (but less prongs): 

Here is an easy gear ratio chart, it will give you a calculation and you can compare it to other sizes that will give you a good gauge to see what you might want to try: bmxultra.com Gear Ratio Chart. I grew up with the 16t rear so my calculations always go relative to that row. Usually BMX racing starts at 45:16, which is really close to what you have at 39:14, and goes up from there. I raced with a 46:16 and never wished for a larger front. This would be about a 40 for you with a 14t rear. If I remember correctly, Fuzzy Hall used a 48:16, and I have seen 53, but that was for a guy on a half pipe to pedal in the flats. Freestyle gears are set about 44:16, which is just between 38 and 39 on a 14t and then go down, I ride 36:14 on my street bike, and although it pedal more to go the same speed, I go as fast as I need to go, but with the advantage of shorter strokes to get up on rails in tight spots. The moral of the story is, you will need to learn what you like for different purposes. My son has 9t rear cassette, and if you are willing to spend the money, you might consider going smaller front AND rear. This will reduce the overall weight due to less metal, it will also reduce the chances of busting your sprocket or chain since you will have smaller parts making them harder to hit. You will find more parts are being made for the 9t rear, which is another incentive to go smaller. Get a 40t front, maybe even try a 41, and since you have a chain-ring rather than a sprocket, you can replace them pretty quick and cheaper. Find what you like and keep your old parts so that if you go too big, you can always go back. You might also want to keep different chains with each sprocket so you dont need to remove or add links. You might even want to swap the gears out on a daily basis depending on what you are riding that day, cross town? use the 41, skatepark? swap out to the 39. 

I have repainted almost every single bike I have owned and have found the absolute best way to be sure you are satisfied with the finished product is to strip the frame COMPLETELY! Pop out all the bearing cups, remove the wheels, cranks, chain, everything that is not welded on. Automotive shops can do it, and might be the best but might not be the cheapest, and even if you mask it, bikes are easier to spot minor mistakes on. Don't forget about places that powder paint farming fences or folding chairs. I have always preferred to do it myself. I was trained to paint cars, but it really isn't hard, just remember to start the motion before pressing the trigger and release it while still in the stroke. Stay about 8-12 inches from the bike. (and be careful when touching up around the string) I would suggest going to a paint shop that sells touch-up paint for cars and have them sell you 2 or 3 spray cans of the paint you want (you can customize to any color on the planet and include "pearl" for that cool shine). Most bikes can be done in 2, but get 3 just in case. string the bike up through the head tube to a tree or something and give it a nice thin bottom coat. Let it dry in the sun for a few hours. Give it a 2nd thin coat. Dry it over night. Then apply the 3rd coat and let it dry. As long as you have decent paint and don't over paint any of the layers, it should last for YEARS! 

I rode BMX professionally (1998 x-games) but my specialty was "Street" as in jumping curbs, sliding rails, wall rides, something like you want to do. My favorite place to ride is in San Francisco. It has so much to ride and lots and lots of curb cuts dropping down into the streets. Not one day of riding ever goes by where I felt that I was 100% safe. I come from the school of thought that stronger parts were more valuable than lighter parts and still ride the strongest (heaviest) bike of anyone I know. Even with the strongest bike around parts fail, tires blow, bolts strip, cables snap. The fear of crashing makes you not do stupid things, that is nature keeping you alive. Mat Hoffman (arguably the most influential BMX rider EVER) has had more injuries than any other rider (you can get The birth of Big Air a documentary about Mat by ESPN on Netflix). Crashing is a part of the sport, the price you pay for the games you play. About the only thing you can do is work your way from smaller curbs to bigger ones and just get used to how your bike handles in the air and on impact. The next most important thing is learn how to crash. Learn how to roll out of a wreck without getting hurt, parkour can help. Here is a video of me wrecking a backflip and walking away no problem.
