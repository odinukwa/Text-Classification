Diogenes Laërtius tells us that when Plato was transported to Aegina to be sold as a slave, he was arrested and was going to be executed without a trial: 

This isn't exactly the same as the sacrifice shown on the show, but I think Lagertha's appearance during the scene fits the "Angel of Death" description, and perhaps that's a hint the producers were aware of Ibn Fadlan's narrative. In any case, it's interesting to note that Ibn Fadlan's story may be supported by (sporadic & isolated) archaeological finds: 

Thus, and strictly speaking, we can't say that Nigeria had stayed together for the whole of its history as an independent state. The ethnic and religious tensions that lead to the civil war still fuel secessionist movements. The Movement for the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB) advocates for the re-establishment of the Republic of Biafra or at least a new state for the Ogbi people. Its members have claimed that the Nigerian police and army harass and prosecute them regularly. In a recent news story, Chief Arinze Igbani has sued both the police and the army for violating his human rights. In another incident, the movement's leader, Ralph Uwazuruike, and 280 other members were reportedly detained, and released after a few days with the intervention of President Jonathan. Another notable secessionist movement, the Movement for the Survival of Ogoni People (MOSOP) advocates for the creation of a state for the Ogoni people, north-east of the Niger Delta. The repression of the Ogoni people is described in some detail in the Human Rights Watch publication The Ogoni Crisis: A Case-Study of Military Repression in Southeastern Nigeria. MOSOP has declared "self-government" in August 2012. A third source of secessionist tension is the Bakassi issue. Nigeria may have given up on its claims on the oil rich Bakassi peninsula in 2008, however the Efik people that traditionally inhabited the area plan to join forces with Southern Cameroon to form an independent nation. Adding to these and various other smaller secessionist movements, sectarian conflict isn't rare either, with the Boko Haram being responsible for over 900 deaths (to date). While what held the country together during its era of military rule might be obvious, since 1999 and the country's first democratic elections it seems that ethnic and religious tensions are constantly growing and currently Nigeria is in a very fragile state. President Jonathan's election in 2011 was met with violence in the predominantly Muslim North, although the election process was hailed in the West. I think the country is one of the worst examples of colonialism, the British had the terrible idea of packing traditionally warring factions into a single country. While researching the answer, I got the feeling that the only time the various ethnic groups of Nigeria had some kind of "national purpose" was when they were fighting the British and now that the British are gone they're back at fighting each other. Simply put, it's a gigantic mess, and if tensions continue to rise, it's not unthinkable that the only solution would be for Nigeria to split into separate states. One factor that might contribute towards Nigeria remaining a single state is that memories of the civil war and the various military dictatorships that followed it are still fresh, but that won't last for long. 

Apparently claiming divine origin for his laws wasn't enough, and Lycurgus asked the Spartans to swear an oath that they would abide by his laws until he returned from another journey at Delphi. When they did, he travelled to Delphi, and after he was re-assured about his laws, he killed himself, binding the Spartans to follow his laws ad infinitum: 

The Ancient Spartan society was based around the laws of Lycurgus, the rhetrae1, that were passed down through oral tradition. A possible explanation of why the laws were not written, and why Spartans didn't keep records in general, comes from Plutarch's The Life of Lycurgus: 

The Thracians are a distinct tribe from the Scythians, so that part of Hitoshi Iwaaki's retelling is historically inaccurate. That said, both tribes were consider barbarians (~ non Greeks) in classical Greece, so that part is accurate. 

Given that our only archaeological evidence is the arrowheads and spearheads Marinatos found, both versions are plausible, since both describe the last stand quite similarly. Further reading: 

1572, with the capture and execution of Túpac Amaru, the last Inca monarch. Túpac Amaru's execution effectively completed the Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire that had started 40 years earlier with the Battle of Cajamarca (November 16, 1532) and the capture of Atahualpa. 

Moving on, the earliest mention of sign language in history comes from Cratylus, one of the more interesting Socratic dialogues. The dialogue's main theme is the relation between language and reality and it's part of the Theory of Forms corpus. In it, Socrates poses the following question (Plat. Crat. 422d & Plat. Crat. 422e): 

Herodotus, a much earlier source, gives a slightly different account, in the first book of his Histories: 

It's an arbitrary decision, and several reversed maps exist. There are also maps that don't follow a standard orientation, some examples are T and O maps, polar maps, and Dymaxion/Fuller maps. Interestingly the iconic 1972 Blue Marble photograph, taken by the Apollo 17 crew, was reversed to fit the traditional view. Further reading: 

It should be noted however that the text starts with pointing out that Lycurgus was an enigmatic figure, and that not much can be said definitively about his life: 

10th-century writer Ahmad ibn Fadlan describes voluntary human sacrifice in his account of a Viking funeral: 

When Geoffrey V died in 1151 an enamel effigy showing three lions was placed on his tomb. A very similar effigy was placed on the tomb of Geoffrey's grandson, William Longespée. It's quite possible that Henry I also used the lion as his symbol, and by passing it on to his son-in-law Geoffrey unwittingly created the tradition of hereditary coat of arms. Henry II of England, Geoffrey's son, also adopted the lion, and according to Wikipedia: 

The story of the assassination attempt against Xerxes comes from Diodorus Siculus' Bibliotheca historica. His general account of Xerxes' campaign is (more or less) consistent with Herodotus', but his version of the battle (book 11, chapters 5-11) is different: 

Modern Tokyo (metropolitan area), home to 0.55% of the world's population 700 AD Chang'an, home to 0.44% of the world's population 200 AD Rome, home to 0.42% of the world's population 

The Graeco-Roman world is a unique example of intertwined cultures, the geographical and historical proximity of the two civilizations is such that's it's often impossible to distinguish where the one ends and the other begins. In extremely broad terms, it wouldn't be inaccurate to say that the political system of the Romans were heavily influenced by the various political systems of the Greek world, after all the high point of the Greek world is earlier than the high point of the Romans, it's only natural that the Romans would benefit from the political philosophy of the Greeks. Livy's story may very well be apocryphal, he is separated from the events he describes by four centuries and in the preface of Ab Urbe Condita he notes: 

Diodorus source for the battle seems to be an earlier historian, Ephorus, and while Herodotus doesn't mention the night attack, Diodorus mention of "shooting arrows and hurling javelins at them from every direction" is consistent with both Herodotus' account and Marinatos' findings. Plutarch attests that the night attack happened in his polemic On the malice of Herodotus, and blames Herodotus for obscuring Leonidas bravery: 

His rank ("governor/priest of On") and the literal meaning of his name ("he whom Ra has given") imply he might have been a High Priest of Ra. 

Airs, Waters, Places is a treatise by Hippokrates of Kos that deals with the effects of the physical environment on living organisms over an extended period of time, and the exact quote Isaac has in mind is: 

The discovery of the bones of four children in a Late Minoan house near the palace centre of Knossos reinforced Warren's belief that the Minoans practiced human sacrifice. Both Warren and Nikolaos Platon supported the human sacrifice interpretation, while other scholars argued that the finds suggested a secondary burial. The more sensational interpretations included cannibalism: 

The scene described takes place in Ithaca after Odysseus return, and "the cable of a curved ship, made of byblus plant" suggests that the Greeks were at the time familiar with the various uses of cyperus papyrus, the papyrus plant. Moving on, Herodotus starts his Histories by describing an event that involved Phoenician traders carrying Egyptian and Assyrian merchandise in Greece: 

One source of the story of Plato being sold into slavery is Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers by Diogenes Laërtius. An English translation is available online on Project Perseus. You can find the full story in Book 3 that discusses the life of Plato. According to Laërtius, Plato angered Dionysius, the tyrant of Sicily, when he suggested that "the interest of the ruler alone was not the best end". Dionysius was going to execute the philosopher but was convinced to spare his life and sell him into slavery instead by Dion, his brother in law and a student of Plato. The philosopher was then taken to the island of Aegina to be sold. There, he was recognised by someone called Anniceris and was ransomed for twenty minas. We don't know for sure who this Anniceris was, one possibility is the Cyrenaic philosopher. Laërtius also mentions that Dion may have provided the money for the ransom to Anniceris. Plutarch (Life of Dion, 5) and Diodorus Siculus (Library, 15) also mention the story.
