Schrader valves are more robust, this is the reason why you see them universally in use for vehicle tires. With Presta, you have to be more careful when putting in or taking off the pump nozzle or you might bend or even break either the rotating (locking) tip of the valve. You could also go to literally any gas station to pump air to your tires if you are using a Shrader valve. Presta's advantage is that it is thinner and the rim has a smaller valve hole in which case it makes the rim stronger. This can be a factor especially in thin bicycle rims. Another advantage of Presta valves is they can be made longer, a lot longer in fact than Shrader valves. This is especially important when you have deep aero type rims. 

A cyclocross bike which can accomodate fenders and a rack could be an option. I personally use an aluminum framed Cannondale CAADX Tiagra on my 17 mile (one way) commute and I like its versatility. It is relatively light (21 lbs) and has eyelets to accommodate fenders and a rack. It can also be fitted with a variety of tires ranging from slicks to studded. The XC frame makes the bike more maneuverable (can be useful in negotiating traffic) than a touring bicycle. Pic of the commuter below: I use this bike 2 or 3 times a week to commute downtown. It is almost as fast as my road bike on uneven roads. The wider tires (that can run at lower pressure) can soak up bumps better. 

Thanks folks. Some Dawes Galaxies have 135 OLN, some have horizontal dropouts, I'm trying to find if there are any that are both. I suppose I'm hoping for answers from Galaxy owners. 

I'd like to built a commuter/utility/messaround type bike. I like hub gears, and I want a steel frame. I've been looking at older Dawes bikes. Specifically a 'Streetwise' or Galaxy. I know some have 135 OLN already (though I'll have to check before I buy). Are all other components standard? Meaning headset dia and threading, bottom bracket, brake mounts, mudguard and rack mounts etc. I've already been caught out with the non standard-ness of older Raleigh and Peugeot bikes, Many thanks. 

I want to build up a steel framed commuter/light tourer/utility bike with hub gears. A Dawes Galaxy from the 1990s era looks about right to provide the frame. But I want 135mm rear dropout spacing (for hub gears) AND semi horizontal dropout (for chain tension). Looking at bikes I'm getting the feeling that I can't get both. It looks like Dawes went to 135mm OLN at the same time as they went to vertical dropouts. I think all 8 speed (and above) rear cassettes were 135mm. Anybody shed any light on this? Thakns 

Another thing to consider is to have a portable speaker mounted on the bike or in a backpack. Perhaps a bit bulky, but it means your ears can compensate as they would do in a normal setting. A good friend of mine uses a case speaker with phone/iPod inside and has that strapped to the handlebar and stem with bungy cords. Not a particularly elegant solution aesthetically, but it works well and is great if you're on a budget! 

It is certainly true that adding bulk to your helmet has some drawbacks in crashes and such, and consequently warrants some concern. In the incidence of a crash, solid, small objects that are fixed to a specific area of the helmet increase the distribution of force on mounting area, instead of spreading it away from the impact site. However, my justification has always been this: a light can prevent just more crashes than not having a light will save you once you have crashed. Essentially, by using a head mounted light, you have more freely accessible light and can therefore be more aware of your surroundings. Equally, your surroundings will be more aware of you. These two facts combine to reduce the likelihood of crashing in the first place. Also, I like to think that landing helmet first with a light attached is just like landing helmet first into a branch or small rock. These are also likely occurrences in MTB riding, so I would assume helmets are designed with at least some thought on this sort of situation. It mightn't be the case in reality, and I haven't confirmed this with standards, but hopefully saying this will give you peace of mind. So yes, as far as personal experience has told me, a fixed light on your helmet can potentially do some harm in the event of a crash, but in the rest of the time spent riding, lights make helmets safer, and therefore makes riding safer. Seems like a good idea to me! 

I have Planet Bike Cascadia fenders and my shoes did clip the metal rods/wire fender supports after I had the fenders installed. This happens when I am making a tight turn while continuing to pedal. Simple solution for me was to cut the protruding rod/wires. Initially I tried to use a hacksaw but had little luck as the coating was hard and the saw just bounced around. I then tried using a pair of big pliers and that did the trick. I found that the wire only had hardened coating but once you pierced that it cut easily... a big set of pliers can easily do the job. 

I have been chased by dogs countless times while riding solo or with a group. In all cases I have never been bitten. I may be wrong but in most cases the dogs just want to frighten you away. What works for me is not to panic, try and maintain a steady speed, and most importantly, make sure not to hit/run over the dog if it is coming towards you. Here is a pic of me and a buddy of an incident with 2 dogs 2 summers ago taken from a GoPro camera: 

In my mind/opinion, flats, cages and cleats (using terminology that should have been invented years ago...) have distinctly different purposes, and their strengths for each application should not necessarily be crossed over to other uses. Let's start with flat pedals. Flats come either with or without pins. (Here's on with pins. $URL$ I used these for several years with the longer pin set-up) Flats without pins are usually low end stock models such as the ones you might see on a kids bike. By adding pins, flats develop an new purpose - the increased grip and hence control that they offer makes them ideal for intense cycling, such as free-riding, downhill, bmx or street trials to name a few. What makes them so good for these disciplines is the ease and speed of connection - put your foot on, and it grips. More importantly, releasing your foot from the pedal is achieved with ease. This enables speedy ejects in accidents or easy releases for hardcore bike tricks. Cages, aka toe clips, straps... are in my mind mainly there to prevent accidental foot release that would lead to smashing your shin or calf. They are not particularly effective at transferring power on the upstroke, but can be used in this manner as well. The other use for cages is to adjust foot position in a kind of set-and-forget way. This is another reason they are so well suited to touring bikes. Finally, cleats, aka clipless, SPD... These pedals offer a large degree of control and unparalleled power transfer in up and down strokes. This alone makes them ideal for road and race bikes. Nowadays, with xc riding and MTB racing gaining popularity, MTB cleat systems are becoming widely acceted. The benefits are the same, better control and power, but that comes at the price of "bailability". Despite the learning curve, accidents still happen to masters, so it is a question that each person should address on their own terms. Long story short, choose whatever system works for your interests and riding style, and stick with it to see if you improve and make progress. Follow that, and it should be all good! 

I'm going through a similar, though not identical, process. It's worth repeating that steel frames, especially lugged ones, are very amenable to adaption. If you look at Ellis Briggs and Bob Jackson's websites (just as examples, they're near me) they can do practically anything you want to a steel frame. There's a cost, of course, but things like mountings for V brakes and various other braze-ons aren't a fortune. And yes, they can spread the rear dropout to take a wider hub. Some of the Dawes Galaxies had a 135 OLN I think, but caveat emptor. Caveat Emptor is latin for take a tape measure with you. There are a few 'gotchas': Older French bikes are a bit non standard (and watch out for the 'quill of death' on Peugeots). Seat posts are different too. Raleighs also. Especially the 597mm wheels they used on some bikes. But the good thing about Raleighs is there are about 4 billion old ones. So you can probably get what you want from scrap ones. And people still makes parts for them, e.g. Phil Woods' bottom bracket. Sheldon Brown has some good articles about old Raleighs. His opinions seems to be they were so well made that things didn't wear out anyway. There's probably an optimum age to get a good traditional steel frame for a project like this. I'm guessing 1990s would be a good age. You can probably get a Reynold lugged steel frame, but fittings would be fairly standard, and the price would be not bad. Lugged frames seem to drop the price a bit, cause they look really old, like your dad's bike. 

There are many causes for price difference in bikes. There are others reasons than these listed below, but they tend to fall in line with one of these four categories. Brand Branding is always a premium. As in every industry I can think of, some brands have a reputation that to some extent justifies a premium price. This reputation is based off a multitude of sub factors, such as warranties, customer care, recognized build quality, athlete association and such. Top brands such as Trek, Giant, Bianchi, etc. have built up a reputation over the years of their existence that people deem worthy of a premium price. Materials Materials used in the frame (and also components, but more on that later) affect the characteristics of the bike, but due to the nature of high-tech processes, these come at a price. For instance, high-modulus carbon fiber performs better than cheaper carbon types. The pricier stuff is lighter, stiffer, stronger, more durable or some combination of the above. Likewise, carbon has superior performance properties compared to aluminium or lower still, steel. Within the scope of any one material (carbon, aluminium or steel) there are many sub-classes that will perform better or worse - and have a price to match. The two bikes listed exemplify this point - both are made from aluminium, but the more expensive bike is made from a higher grade (7005 as opposed to 6061). The more expensive option also has a carbon fork - an expensive but potentially worthwhile investment. Components Bikes most commonly come as complete units, with only super high-end models available as frame only builds. This means your money is covering all the components on the bike as well as the frame. Components make a big difference to the bike's performance, from weight or strength to durability or aesthetics. The componentry of your bike directly influences the way you use it. For instance, clipless pedals (such as Shimano's SPD system) determine the way you pedal. The bike listed have some important differences in componentry: The cheaper of the two has gear shifters separate to the brake levers. This is common on cheap road bikes, but in my opinion is incredibly annoying. Purists may argue that old bikes were made this way, but honestly, I find them almost dangerous due to the necessity for hand position changes every time you go to change gear or brake. Perhaps just a personal opinion, but worth considering. The other big component difference is the gruppo - the drive-train, gears, etc. On the dearer model we have a FSA Omega compact BB30 Crankset. While not the top of the line, I would assume that this particular set would be more reliable or better built that the otherwise unnamed model from the cheaper option. Finally, before we get bored of details, the wheels are an important component to consider. More expensive options are sometimes made from carbon, but stepping down from the elite we still see performance features such as flattened spokes or radial spoke arrangements. The Equation R's on the Diamondback have radial spoke lacing, but the Vilano does not. Customization In the realms of the super elite, performance gains become harder to achieve, and the associated cost increases drastically. There appears to be some sort of law of diminishing returns at play - the price difference between a 20kg bike and a 19kg one may be $200, while it could well cost you $2000 to save a couple of grams of paint (not kidding - check out Trek's Project One customization site, specifically the 5gm Vapor Coat Paint. That's pricey!). Essentially, we reach a point in the spectrum of bikes that performance is so good, that other factors such as custom paint or gram savings through carbon brake levers and spacers become the only avenues for improvement. This uber-rich world of cycling is almost exclusively for the professionals and hence self-funds through sponsorships and such, but it is available for anyone lucky enough to have deep pockets and exorbitant taste! So those are the main reasons for the price discrepancy. Hopefully that should educate your purchasing decision! Good luck!
