I have mostly commonly heard those two terms used together in skiing. Frontcountry is lift served skiing inside the resort boundaries verses backcountry skiing where you ski up the hill first before you ski down it. (i.e. the front of the mountain is where the lifts and trails are, the back is where they aren't. ) Frontcountry is a relatively new term compared to backcountry. Backcountry in general implies a more remote setting and one that you reach only on by self-propelled means. I would expect nothing in the way of facilities in a backcountry camping site. I have never heard the term frontcountry applied to camping. But I guess it makes sense as an antonym to backcountry. Backcountry camping would generally imply that you carry in everything you need on foot and there isn't anything setup for you when you get there. So in general frontcountry would imply some kind of facility or access that somehow make it "not backcountry". 

The accepted answer has lot's of useful info, but misses the mark. The problem is that the term backcountry is so overloaded, it can mean anything from a simple tromp through the woods to the most difficult ski mountaineering descents. My reading of the original question is the next step up from classic XC skis meant for groomed trails to a long skinny ski with a metal edge. (i.e. something like the Fischer S-bound or Madhus Glittertind skis) While you can get an AT setup that will work on "backcountry" skis, you'll need to spend somewhere in the range of $1000 for boots and bindings, and unless you are skiing terrain that is similar to a downhill resort, it will be a very awkward setup with the mode switching that AT gear requires. The type of ski and skiing mentioned in the original question is often referred to as the "holy grail" among people interested in this kind of stuff. I've spent 30 years trying many various combinations of boots and bindings and all of them work and all of them have serious drawbacks. Any boot that is light and flexible enough to make kick'n'glide fun on flat and gentle sloping ground is going to make turning on steeper and icier ground difficult. Any boot/binding that provides enough support for turning skinny skis is going to be a dog on the flat ground. You have to pick your poison. I find that I have the most fun when boot, binding and ski are roughly balanced. Putting a burley boot on a light ski or light boots on a burley ski can work, but it just isn't that much fun. The advice I always give is to pick the boot first, and then pick the binding that works with that boot. How well a light boot fits is by far and away the most important factor in turning light skis with light boots. If you can find an SNS or NNN/BC boot that gives you a snug ski boot like fit, (no heel movement when you flex the boot), then that's the boot you should get. If you find a 75mm light boot that fits you well, then 3pins would be an appropriate choice. The market for lightweight 75mm gear has shrunk significantly in the last 5 years or so, there aren't that many choices anymore. I haven't been that impressed by current offerings for SNS or NNN/BC boots, they are all pretty heavy and don't offer much extra control for the weight. I would take a serious look at XC combi boots ( i.e. skate and classic combo boots ) for at least the skinner end of the "backcountry" ski range of skis. It would be very helpful to this question if you could list the dimensions of the skis you are looking at ( width at tip/middle/tail ) and the typical terrain you want to ski. 

Simply - it's not. Rather it is not universal. I have hiked for years with my wife who has much shorter legs and a much shorter pace. I have never experienced greater exhaustion due to hiking her pace. It is possible that you are getting more tired because you are taking very slow and deliberate steps. The extra focus on your step may mean you are tensing your muscles more in order to walk a pace you are not used to. If that is the case try shortening your stride instead of walking slower. 

When we store our headlamps, currently we store them with the batteries. Should they instead be stored separate from the batteries? 

You asked about dosing. My recommendation is to get a professional to figure out the dosing. If you cannot get a professional, then do not carry this as you are potentially introducing as much risk as you are mitigating. When carrying a medication such as this for a possible emergency, there are several things I would recommend. Get a doctor to prescribe it. - This will do the most to ensure you have the correct dosage and minimize adverse affects. I carry several prescription drugs while hiking. In my experience it is usually possible to find a doctor who is willing to prescribe medication "just in case". Only use it for the person prescribed Make sure you carry information on the drug in a weatherproof container. Make sure this container an be found by the rescue personnel. They need to know. If you know you will be at risk, it is reasonable to carry solutions to said risk. However, as with any emergency gear, you must make sure that you are trained to use it, and that you have the right solution. By example, you might need stitches, but unless you know how to suture it is pointless to carry a suture kit. Never carry gear you don't understand. It will tempt you to use it, putting yourself at greater risk. One could make an argument that if you know someone is going to die, it is "worth a shot". I would generally recommend against this. As a layman, one is not terribly well qualified to determine that someone is "going to die". In addition, it could complicate treatment if help is on way and arrives in time. 

The best solution I found was spectra webbing for the tree wrap and dyneema cord. You don't want to wrap trees with a thin cord as you can easily cut into the tree and damage it. The Amsteel cord found in sailing shops is an easy way to get dyneema cord. 

I have the Gerrig system and for me the primary advantage is the ability to spray water. In really hot weather sometimes the most effective use of water is to spray it on you, rather than drink it. This is easy to do with a standard cycling water bottle and next to impossible with most hydration packs. Doing 8 hr MTB races, I have problems with muscle cramping late in the event. Spraying water on my legs helps a lot. With the Gerrig system I don't need to carry both a water bottle and a hydration pack. It's also quite useful in muddy conditions to alleviate the gunk in the drive train. While the pressurization is a nice benefit for actually drinking water, I don't think it's enough of a benefit on it's own to balance the trade off in extra weight and complexity. Having said that the system I have works really well and outside of the extra weight has no other drawbacks in over 3 years of use. 

6 of one, half dozen of another. A lot comes down to how easy it is to hike in the ski boots you are using. The problem with hiking is that it only takes a short stretch of unpacked trail to lose any gain in time and you can't take advantage of any brief downhill stretches. Even with skins you can get a bit of glide. On the other hand, if the trail has been boot packed, skinning can be difficult and in hard crusty conditions, boots and crampons are generally faster. I'm not sure I buy the 1lb on the feet vs 6 on the back argument. If you're moving your skis up and down that much, you need to work on your skinning technique. Also half the time, half the weight of skis is just resting on the ground vs you having to support it. 

I'll caveat this with -- I've never vomited in my gear, nor do I know anyone who has. But I did sit and figure out how I'd try to solve this if it happened to me. 

I tried pitching a tarp instead of a tent this weekend. In worked well, kept off the rain etc, except for the condensation. It was far worse than any condensation I've ever had in a tent. We had other tents nearby and they didn't experience the same issue. There were rivulets of water running down the inner underside of the tarp leading me to believe it was not just our breathe condensing. One of our sleeping bags was totally soaked. There was one rainy night and one dry night and both nights the condensation was horrible. Is there a specific way of pitching a tarp setup to prevent this? A quick google only has answer like "Well this can occur in any shelter", but while true, it was definitely MUCH worse in the tarp tent. For reference (edited with more detail) 

If you are stealth camping, it helps to have a tent that blends in. If you are camping where there is hunting, it helps to have a tent with bright, high contrast so that you can be sure you are seen. Also (thanks to Ben Crowell for the comment) you may want tents that blend in for high traffic areas to disturb the scenery less. High contrast tents can be useful in the backcountry to make it easier to spot your tent. That being said, I've never considered color in tent purchases. 

I'm considering an ultralight (non-waterproof) shell and Nikwax wash-in waterproofing as a rain layer. I'd like it to be waterproof through several wearings (a week or more). Does this result in a garment which will actually repel water in a heavy rain? 

These are generally known as glacier glasses. They are rated as Category 4 on the CE scale and you aren't supposed to drive while wearing them. Sunglasses in Category 4 only transmit 4-8% of available visible light. Hidalogos sunglass guide has a very complete list of the different factors in choosing sunglasses. Category 4 come in a wider range of styles than in the past. Julbo in particular makes several models that don't resemble the classic leather side flap models. I can recommend their Zebra photochromic lens, but that may not work for you. Category 3 might work for you as well, most standard sunglasses are only Category 2. You need to buy "sport" sunglasses to get Category 3 level glasses. You can get prescription versions of some versions of these sunglasses. 

Personally, I can easily see how this unintended loading can happen. Second gets to a tricky part, asks leader for beta, leader moves over to get a better view of second. This question is an example of one of the really hard problems in climbing. It's almost impossible to get feedback about how well you are building your anchors. You just don't get many chances to be wrong. 99% of the time any protection you place simply won't be tested in any way. Most of the time it simply doesn't matter if you build a crap anchor or a bomber one. If nobody falls or the belayer has a good enough position to hold the fall with body weight, the anchor never gets stressed. It's next to impossible to know if you are good or just lucky. You can develop or follow really bad practices for a very long time and not suffer any consquences. The America Death Triangle is a classic example. In the 70's when I was learning to climb, that was standard practice in the USA. Everybody I climbed with used it, so I used it too. Ideally, you'd like to spend time building anchors and throwing dummies off cliffs, but that's expensive in ropes and time. One way you can get better at building anchors is aid climbing, but that pretty old school these days. 

Yes, I could carry netting, but at that point the tarp + netting would be both more hassle and more weight than my tent. (Which is where Ryley is 100% wrong about a tent not protecting me from nature. I've never had mosquitoes in my tent) 

If carrying a three person tent when backpacking, what's the recommended way to split it up so that the weight is balanced out among all three people going? 

A lot of hikers carry denatured alcohol for cooking. Is there any risk to using it as an antiseptic for cuts and lacerations? 

Start by wetting them so you don't get mold into the air. With a weak Lysol solution, scrub them with a toothbrush. Let them dry, and spray them with MiraZyme. Or as ShemSeger says, just get new ones :) 

I was climbing with someone recently and they complained that there was too much slack any time the line wasn't completely taut. By the same token when they were belaying me it was almost hard to climb because it felt like the rope was pulling me off the wall the whole time. How much tension/slack should there be? Is there a good safe "zone" or is it just purely personal preference? Edit: Generally I am not climbing more than 30' and I'm climbing indoors. I apologize for the vagueness. I'm just very new to climbing. 

As with everything -- it depends. My wool socks from wal-mart have outlasted literally everything else we have purchased, including most of our gear. They still keep my toes toasty warm. Wal-mart is a go-to kind of store for hunters in the south because they have good inexpensive warm clothes. Wool socks from wal-mart generally last me around ten years/pair... However, walk two aisles over, or even in the same aisle, and you will find things that will fail in ten days. The question could more generally be stated as "does price guarantee quality", and the answer is no. While the stuff two aisles over at wal-mart might fail, the same is true of most other stores. For instance we never buy several of the "Name" hiking brands because they have failed us and rapidly at that (I leave out names because I don't want to smear a brand). Whether or not you will be more "at risk" depends solely on following one rule. NEVER test new gear at the extremes, no matter how cool, or what you paid for it. Test where failure is not fatal. And that goes just as equally for "name" as for "generic" 

Since you used "effective" rather than possible, my 2 cents would be that you should set the steepest skin track that allows you to climb at a consistent rate. If the track is so steep that you are stopping to rest every 10 steps, you will gain elevation slowly. There is also a school of thought that says your uptrack should be as beautiful as your tracks descending. This school tends to smooth transitions and lower climb angles. They view zig-zag kick turns as the method of last resort. A great source for tips from the Steeper is Better school is the website SteepChuter.com website The exact angle that will be 'too steep' on any given day is far too dependent on conditions and equipment to pick any numeric values. Generally it's somewhere between 20 and 30 degrees. A good rule of thumb is that if it's too steep to skin straight up, you should start thinking about avalanche hazard. As to when booting up is a more efficient means, this depends a lot snow conditions and how heavy your skis are. If the snow is hard and icy, crampons can be faster on even relatively flat slopes. I often use just crampons for early morning starts in spring corn snow ski season. Booting up is generally only used in soft snow conditions when the terrain doesn't allow a zig-zag skin track. (i.e. couloirs and narrow ridges.) And if the snow is deep enough booting up can be next to impossible. 

Breaking Strength The rule of thumb for rigging is that the breaking strength of the rope should be roughly 15x the static load. That's something in the 1300 kg breaking strength range. Probably overkill for a hammock over a soft surface, but if you plan on pitching over rocks or in more precarious locations is worth investigating. Also, the tighter you rig your hammock the more the load on the endpoints is magnified. Stretch The standard nylon cords available stretch signficantly under load and even more when they get wet. Even "static" cords like paracord can stretch. For a hammock, even a little stretch can be a problem.
