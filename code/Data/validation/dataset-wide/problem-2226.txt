Usually people who have these kind of boots get this process done before they are worn. A lot of people say that doing this also decreases the lifespan of the boot. Older boots have the chance of the liner inside to start to break down over time which obviously makes it hard to heat mold them. Knowing that you have used these boots for 3 seasons and 3 seasons of wear have not maintained the shape of the liner, it might be time to move on. But on the other hand, it wouldn't bankrupt you to try. Most ski and board shops offer this service at a relatively cheap cost. Between $15 and $40. Check with the shop you bought them at and you might get a deal. To sum up. The pros of doing this is that it might actually work and you won't have to spend big money to purchase new boots. The cons of this is that you spend $15-$40 on the molding and or you have to buy new boots. 

In football, there is IR (Injury Reserve) and IR/Designated for Return. This new IR/Designated for Return was created in 2012 to allow a team to put one player on IR that is eligible to come back during the season. The team can put a player on the IR/Designated for Return list only if... 

If you look at the picture above, You will see that you (obviously) need to bring your racket up in the air and then follow through with your swing, pushing your racket down. This does create a fast serve which makes it difficult for a novice player to return. But if you're playing an experienced player who knows how to return a fast paced ball, that player will most likely return the ball before you can recover from your "overhand" swing follow through. This is why most people serve underhand so that their racket will be in position when the opponent returns the ball. To sum up pros and cons... 

Here's an example In the picture below showing the current standings of the Eastern Conference, you can see that the top 2 rows consist of 3 teams for each division. If the season ended today, these 6 teams (3 from the Atlantic Division and 3 from the Metropolitan Division) will make the playoffs. In the third row, you see a list of every other team in the conference. The top 2 teams in this list are "Wild Card" teams and will also make the playoffs. The playoff seedings would look like this: #1 Toronto vs. #8 Boston (Boston is the wild card team with the least amount of points and will face the team with the most points in the conference which is Toronto) #2 Pittsburg vs. #7 Tampa Bay (Tampa Bay is the wild card team with the most amount of points and will face the team with the 2nd most points in the conference) 

I've noticed in the NBA that when a player takes a foul shot, they're usually surrounded by other players lined up around the box. But sometimes when a player is shooting a foul shot, they're completely alone. What is the difference between these two foul shooting situations? 

I've looked around and no where can I find instances where skaters wear 2 pairs of socks. I actually found someone's post saying that he did this and his feet slid around too much. If you wear two socks, your feet will slide around because of the two layers. This causes foot blisters and a decreased amount of control you will have while skating. I hope it makes sense when I say two socks will make your feet slide around yet make the skate tight. You do not want this. You want the skates tight without the aid of wearing two socks. You want the skates to fit perfectly with one pair of socks. A point brought up by many is... 

The player then will be allowed to practice with the team after 6 weeks and can be activated after 8 weeks. When activated, the team must make room for him on the 53 man roster. This can be done by trading or waiving a current rostered player Source 

The person with the puck should cross over and enter the zone first The center should then pass the puck to the trailing winger The center should then rush the net The winger should either shoot the puck or look for a cross crease pass directed towards the center (Not in your scenario but maybe something to take up with your coach) 

I've heard that this year they will be introducing a new soccer ball for World Cup. What are the differences between this ball and the ball that was used in previous years? Why did they feel the need to change balls? 

To sum up, the ownership pays for all the rings and decides who receives them. The list above shows the norm. 

Usually after a hockey game, a third party names the "Three Stars" of the game. This is based on the player's performance during the hockey game. These "Stars" come out one at a time and acknowledge the fans by either taking a lap or just raising their stick. After a little digging, I found that in the NHL, the three stars was first awarded in the 1936â€“37 NHL season and continues today. 

This means that the the 2 wild card spots in the Eastern Conference can consist of one of the following: 

After the realignment, the league now consists of 2 conferences with 2 divisions in each conference. NHL playoffs consist of 16 teams fighting for the last two spots to compete in the Stanley Cup Final The way the new playoff structure works is as follows... 

This took me a long time to find. According to the USA Track & Field rule book for 2013, there is no maximum age limit for the main "OPEN" and "MASTERS" classifications of race walking. There is however a maximum age limit for other classifications. Classifications 

I highly doubt it is referring to a score of a game for one reason. NFL scores are never written with the losing team's score listed first. If a team A beat team B 34 to 19, the score would be written 34 - 19. This make it easy to narrow the numbers down to a date. There are two events that are significant with this date 

This is known as water training. Training with water far before an eating competition is very common. The act of chugging a gallon of water quickly over a long period of time will indeed stretch your stomach. If the competitor does this regularly before a competition, it will help him/her fit more food in their stomach. As a side note, this is not recommended by doctors as it is very dangerous. Drinking a large amount of water in a short period of time can dilute the electrolytes in your blood, which can lead to a loss of heart, muscle and brain function. Quotes from competitors on water training... 

Number of points If points are equal, number of wins If wins are equal, net run rate If net run rate is equal, bowling strike rate If bowling strike rate is equal, the head-to-head match 

You definitely waited until the right age for you son to start throwing this pitch. It is recommended to wait until the child is 15-16 years old before throwing this pitch. There are very few resources on the web that list the recommended number of pitches a player should throw at this age because everybody is different. But throwing a curve ball at this young of an age is very dangerous if you throw it incorrectly. So you have to be very carful. Throwing a curve ball with bad technique can cause serious elbow injuries. As long as he is throwing the curve correctly, he can throw as many as he wants. If he complains about any pain or pinching, stop immediately. If you want to play it safe, take the number of pitches (non curves) he usually throws, cut it in half and have him throw that many that day. Do this until he feels perfectly comfortable. Here is a video that shows the proper way to throw a curveball without causing injury. I also agree with what wax eagle said. Talk to your doctor. I'm just trying to make a point that if done incorrectly, your son might injure his elbow. 

According to the World Pool Billiard Association, this occurrence is also a foul under rule 6.1 sub rule 8.5 

Ten of the teams in the ICC Twenty20 Cricket World Cup are "seeded" teams. They are the 10 governing bodies of the ICC and known as "test teams" and they are automatic entries into the ICC T20 Cricket World Cup. These 10 teams are split up by the ICC into four groups. Within each group, the teams are ranked (seeded) according to the previous season's performance. The teams are seeded based on the following stats (again, from the previous season), listed in order of priority... 

I'm not a big golfer, but many people in my family play the sport, so I'm constantly surrounded by golf equipment and lingo. I've always wondered why the golf balls being used have "dimples" on the surface. See in the picture. 

Source As you can see from the following photos, none of these players wear the traditional "C" captain's patch on their uniform. Why is that? 

When it comes to 40 minutes of playing time or ANY length of game debate, it depends on which league and which school you are playing for. Most league's game is 40 minutes in length (two 20 minute halves). Here are some links to other school rule books that state the same 40 minute game. Florida Atlantic University Angelo State University New Mexico State University 

Many recommend thin socks or even underarmor-like tights. These allow the skate to be tight on your foot but also allow you to feel where your foot is thus resulting in better performance and control. Some players don't even wear socks with skates. LA Kings goalie Jonathan Quick is rumored to not wear any socks! 

There is no score/tie game after 40 minutes. Most schools/leagues have 40 minute long games. See explanation below. The game is being played in the "Game to goals" fashion and the score is tied at one goal less than the game total (The game total is the pre-determined number of goals required to win the game. In a "game to 15," the game total is 15). This method is made clear in the USA Ultimate Rule Book 

If the cue ball is shot and is resting on the rail, it is considered not in play. According to the United States Professional Pool Players Association Rule 3.b, this occurrence would result in a break foul. 

I am a die hard Pats fan and I have always wondered this. Before the 2012-2013 season, the Patriots released their captain list... 

Why do certain soccer balls have different panel patterns on them? Is there controversy between each style? Which leagues and or tournaments use each style? For example, see the pictures below... 

If your question is if this system is fair, then my response is that it is highly criticized. This method has been criticized based on the fact that wickets are (necessarily) a much more heavily weighted resource than overs. For winning a match if rain is interpreted the match, strategy could be to not lose wickets and score at what would seem to be a "losing rate. So teams could use this rule to win the game, which most teams have a strategy to do so. Another criticism is that the duckworth-lewis method does not include the changes in the proportion of number of overs during which field restrictions are in place compared to a completed match. The most common criticism is that this method is just down right too complicated to understand since it involves very heavy math. This method is the only choice that officials have to calculate the score of a match that is interrupted by weather or other circumstances. 

I'm a bit confused to the "no brainer" type of question that this is. No offense to the user at all. I'm just trying to figure out what you are exactly asking. Let me try to answer this. In all types of sports that require a piece of equipment (ski, board etc.) that allows the athlete to move across a surface (water, snow etc.), the bottom of this piece of equipment has to be smooth. If you look at a snow ski or a snow board, the bottom of these pieces of equipment have to be waxed constantly to provide the smoothest bottom. The smoothness allows the board/ski to glide over the snow with no friction. If there were scratches or dents on the underside, this would cause friction and would result in a slower ride. This also is the same for water sports. If water skis had dents, bumps, scratches etc on the underside, this would result in friction against the water. You want the water to flow underneath the skis/board with no resistance. If you had a scratch or bump on the underside, the water would contact that bump, making you're ride slow with a lot of drag.

According to Law 6 of the Laws of Cricket, the length of the bat may be no more than 38 in (965 mm) and the width no more than 4.25 in (108 mm). If you wish to cover the blade with tape etc., the covering permitted for standard bats have to be of thickness not exceeding 0.012 in (0.3 mm) before treatment. When it comes to the handle, it should not exceed 52% of the overall length of the bat. 

In the NBA, when the ball is in one end of the court, a ball boy usually squeegees the other end. In some cases the ball boy is caught off guard by a steal or an unexpected play and in some cases almost gets in the way of players. Although I have never seen it happen (I'm sure it has), what happens if a ball boy inadvertently interferes with a player? In the MLB, this same principle happens as well. When a player goes to the side of the field to try to catch a pop fly, sometimes they run into the ball boy. In the MLB, what happens if a ball boy inadvertently interferes with a player? As you can see in the picture below, this ball boy is interfering with play B.J. Upton. 

After looking at what people had to say about the bindings, you are correct. Setting the bindings towards the back of the board will create more lift in the front that will allow you to cut through and stay above the powder better. I would suggest setting your bindings back anywhere from 1" - 2". Or follow this diagram... 

Answer: YES The serve, in squash is called an Hard Serve or Power Serve. But not many experienced players do it for the sole purpose that you are leaving yourself in a bad position for the return. 

These divisions usually pop up in college intramural sports. The most common of these sports include: volleyball, kickball, dodgeball, wiffleball, badminton, bowling, ultimate frisbee, Eclipse Ball, and Sports Trivia. 

To add on Ben Miller's answer, which is absolutely correct, the website Deadspin actually legally bought out one BBWAA member to claim the member's vote as Deadspin's vote. This member's name has not been released publicly yet. What will happen is that Deadspin will turn the vote over to the Deadspin readers who will then, as a mass, vote on who they want inducted into the Hall Of Fame. Whoever the readers choose, the BBWAA member will then vote for the reader's chosen player. So in this case, A BBWAA member is still voting for a player, but his/her vote is being sourced by readers from a website. The member's name will be published after the vote and will likely result in a firing of that person. Due to this obvious career ending dilemma, many think that this BBWAA member is at the end of his/her career. You can read more about this in this article. 

I do this drill all the time in my hockey league. If you think about a normal NHL style break out, the center usually takes the puck up ice, breaks the offensive zone, and then passes the puck to the trailing / waiting winger. This exercise (though only being half the rink) is simulating that same play I mentioned above. It is simulating the center (in your case the player with the puck) entering the zone and passing it immediately to the winger (in your case the player without the puck). Since this is simulating the well known "breakout" in hockey where the center skates in, breaks into the offensive zone and then passes the puck, in your scenario...
