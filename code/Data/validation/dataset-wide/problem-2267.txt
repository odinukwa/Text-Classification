I think that the "do not have enough food" part is key here to make sure we are on the same page. If you have enough food but are not eating it, then you're dieting, not rationing. Maybe this is not correct given the technical definitions of the words, but I think this fits with most peoples' view of what it means to ration: to limit the use to avoid running out entirely. If I have 3 days worth of food but I think I might not be able to get any more food for 6 weeks, then the math is simple. I can... 

I will second that. Some people claim their wood is dry, but if you go look at how they "cover" it, sometimes you see that the wood is only protected from the lightest of rains in the lightest of winds. I have seen some "coverings" that any amount of normal wind would blow the rain right under and onto the wood. Techniques for fire starting in wet conditions 

Caveat (warning) If you are do not know how long you will need to ration, you need to make sure you do not over-ration. You can die from starvation even while you are still eating sparingly. Some people have died from hunger or thirst even when they had more food or water available. They rationed so hard they died before using all their supplies. Please don't die of thirst when you still have water left. How much is the right amount? It's hard to say, and either way is a gamble. If you are stuck in a dry mine, the middle of Antarctica without a heat source, or in a prison cell after a prison is abandoned, then I am sorry for you. Otherwise, food and water can be procured in the vast majority of locations on Earth, even harsh ones. Ration softly and spend your remaining days as a race to learn to extract food and water from wherever you are. See also this other outdoors.SE question where the amount of time one can survive with zero food is discussed a bit more. 

I am the one who left the comment you quoted, so I'll provide some advice from that point of view. If you open with "Where have you been?" or something similar, or ask it very early on, then cautious people very well could be unnerved. Even if I was not afraid of you, asking where I have been or am going is not necessarily rude, per se, but it seems odd out of context. Asked merely out of the blue, I would assume that the other person is either comparing their trip to mine and might even try to 1-up me with something like "Ow wow, that's neat. I've come twice that far." or the like, or that they are a bit stalker-ish. I will not assume that you definitely are a stalker, but I will be wary that you could be. If, on the other hand, I stopped and talked to you for longer than a passing nicety, then there could be situations in which you could ask about my travels. After talking about the weather, or about the trail conditions, or about your dogs, or something else, if you said "I still have a long walk ahead of me too. 15 more miles just for today. What about you? Where are you headed?" That would sound a whole lot better. And maybe that was even what you had in mind in your original answer that I commented on. In this situation, I might even tell you all about my trip and have a great conversation with you about it. It could also work, even up front, if it was in the context of some reason why that information was useful to you. "Hey, I am looking for a river that is supposed to be up ahead and was wondering if you came from that way?" or "Hello. I just ran into [insert appropriate obstacle] in the path a couple miles back beyond the fork. Which way are you going?" Then obviously that is also fine. But just by itself, with no conversational context, I'm likely to raise an eyebrow and respond with "I have at least a few miles to go. I'll find out when I get there." and try to end the conversation short. Some people are that abrupt and are just being friendly, but generally that is an odd context-less question. And I don't want to take the risk that you might be up to no good (no good doesn't even need to be evil; I have heard of people playing pranks on others, something I would still want to avoid). 

Would you rather start a 39 day fast while starting in your normal, healthy state of body or a 3 to 6 day fast in a less healthy, starving state of body? You probably will die in the first scenario since you likely cannot survive 5 and a half weeks of zero nutrition. Yet many people all over the world are used to eating several times less food than you or I every day as a normal part of their lives for their entire life. If you risk death from having zero food, we are told by the experts (I use that term loosely, but I would rather heed the advice than risk death) that you will die within a few weeks of eating nothing. A few weeks. People do not starve to death from a few weeks of severe malnourishment when they eat a tiny amount, rather, they live long, unhealthy lives for months or years. Summary You can stay alive for a long time in an unhealthy state of starvation as long as you keep eating small amounts of food, but once you stop eating altogether (which is what will happen when you run out of food from eating it to soon) the timer to a 100% certain death starts counting since people generally survive only a few weeks without eating anything no matter how much they bulked up first. So the rationing question becomes this... Choose one: Do you want certain death in a few weeks, or do you want to live a malnourished, unhealthy life for a lot longer and maybe (or maybe not) die in months or years? 

Despite the many answers here, I do not see one that I personally experienced; and, in fact, I see the mistaken idea that "Once it's deep enough there's no difference; 2.5m and 25m are equivalent." I disagree. When I was younger and was still learning to swim, I decided to go "swimming," thinking that I could do so. That was my intention, at least. I decided to leave the area where I was supposed to be wading, and I walked over to an area where the water was much deeper. How deep, I'm not sure, but it was much higher than I was tall. I quickly found out that I could not really swim like I thought I could. Unfortunately for me, I have never been able to float well; I seem to be one of those "negative buoyancy" people, even more-so when I was younger. So I sank to the bottom, and I was not able to get back to the surface since I could not swim. I was terrified at first, but then I realized that if I kicked off of the bottom hard I could get a reasonable distance up, and if combined with my previously futile flailing I could actually break surface for a moment, just long enough to breathe, before sinking back down. I did this up and down almost-swimming a few times and realized that I could keep it going enough to stay alive, so I started trying to slowly work my way back while doing this. It was very slow going and I went top to bottom back to top, gasping what air I could each time I inched my way, many times before I got to safety. I was probably running on adrenaline for part of that, and I recall being exhausted and barely being able to pull myself out of the water. I am not sure how deep the water was, but I would guess maybe 3 to 5 meters. If it had been 1 to 3 meters deeper, maybe I could still have just barely reached the surface, maybe not; I don't know. So something in the 4 to 7 meter range I'll guess was survivable for me. If it had been 30 meters, I might not be alive now to provide this answer. So yes, there can be a difference between "way over your head but only somewhat deep" and "wow that is way freaking deep." That is, assuming you cannot swim. If you can swim, then the difference just became much smaller, but still present according to some other answers. Now that I am much older and can swim fine, I have swam in water deep enough that I don't know where the bottom is. As such, my first instinctive reaction to OP's question was "There is not really a difference," but then I quickly remembered my incident back when I could not yet swim. Of course, if there had been a sign saying "Danger: This water is way freaking deep" I might have still "swam" there anyway, since I was under the false notion that I could swim. But that is a separate matter and is only one aspect of the question. 

As noted in a comment, all wood can be considered to release toxins in the smoke when burned. You may be exposed to more toxic smoke if you burn hotter fires. Wood contains a lot of chemicals, and burning it involves a lot of chemical reactions. Different chemicals burn off into the smoke at different temperatures. I do not smoke food, but my understanding of food smoking is that lower temperature smoke is better for smoking meat. I have read that more toxic chemicals tend to smoke out at much higher temperatures, approaching or exceeding 1000 degrees F (540 C). This is especially relevant to those using home-made wood charcoal, as the chemicals which burn at lower temp are already driven off, so you are more likely to be burning a hotter fire with less pleasant smoke. Likely less smoke overall, but that smoke may be made of more toxic chemicals. I have made some good quality charcoal and plan to try some crafts next year such as pottery, melting down steel, or making some glass; these require very high temperatures (please use extreme caution and do your research if you follow suit). When I recently found out that late-stage smoke may be more toxic, that was concerning to me. If I do these projects, I will need to avoid the smoke as much as possible. I recall a few articles which discuss the higher-temp toxic smokes, but I do not remember how to get at them now. I will update this answer within a day or two after I track down the reference links.
