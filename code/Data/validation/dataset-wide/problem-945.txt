In my opinion, there's 3 primary factors. There's a difference between ice ages and ice age periods. The Milankovich cycles appear to play a key role in the forming and receding of individual ice ages, but what it doesn't appear to do is trigger ice age periods. The modern Quaternary ice age period began about 2.58 million years ago. Milankovich cycles likely began long before then, so it's unlikely that Milankovich cycles triggered the period, only that they play a role in the cycle within the period. Same is likely true for solar maximums and minimums. They come and go, but they aren't likely the drivers of ice age periods. Timeline of glaciation the Quaternary, the Karoo and the Andean-Saharan ice ages all happened in the last 450 million years, and they were separated by long periods so the cause should be looked at more long term. Milankovich cycles operate on 26,000, 42,000 and 100,000 timelines, much to short to drive changes over millions of years. OK - the 3 things. Land and ocean placement, Solar output (long term, not short term sunspot changes), and CO2 Land and Ocean Placement One thing that seems necessary for ice age periods is a large land mass over one or both of the poles. The reason for this is pretty straight forward, land gives ice a place to grow and as land ice grows into a glacier, Albedo increases and oceans drop. High altitude over the glacier tends to blow cold air and maintain the glacier. Also as oceans cool, oceans can hold more CO2, dropping atmospheric CO2 and reducing the greenhouse effect. These feedback loops tend to make ice ages colder and they are only possible with land over one or both of the poles. Antarctica drifted over the South Pole and began forming a glacier about 30 million years ago and, in maybe 15-25 million years, it will drift off the the south pole and begin to melt. I think, once Antarctica drifts into warmer waters, ice ages are likely to stop. 15 million years or so? Maybe more? It's also possible that Canada or Russia drift over the North Pole and as the the giant Antarctic Glacier is replaced by a giant Arctic Glacier, but I think the general consensus is that we can expect ice ages to stop when antarctic drifts over warmer water. We can also expect higher sea level too, lower Albedo and no more ice age cycle. Solar output - long term, not short term sunspot cycles. The sun growing more luminous, meaning, more energy for Earth, it's expected to grow warmer by about 10% over the next billion years - roughly 1% every 100 million years. (Source). 1% might not sound like much but it actually is. Solar variation, which is believed to have caused the Mini ice age, has a variation of about 1 - 1.5 watts per square meter. (Source) A 1% more luminous sun would be in the range of 13-14 watts per square meter, so as the sun grows brighter, and if everything else stays the same, certainly within 100-200 million years, the sun would be sufficiently hot to make ice ages pretty darn unlikely. This site suggests that a 10% increase in solar luminosity could result in 47 °C, 116 °F. It will take quite a bit less than that to end ice ages. (Source) We also have to consider orbital drift. If the Earth is slowly moving away from the sun, that's a factor too, and by this study, it is moving away, at 15 CM per year (Source), so, in 100 million years, 150,000 km, 0.1% further from the sun, about 0.2% less solar irradiance, which is only 20% of the increase in solar output,so this, at least by current estimates, will be overshadowed by the sun growing brighter. (Source) Carbon Sequestering / atmospheric CO2 PPM Finally, and very difficult to predict over the long term is carbon sequestering. CO2 has generally been decreasing over millions of years and the drop in CO2 may have played a role in the current ice age cycle. It's entirely possible, though some might disagree, but it's certainly possible that our current uptick in CO2 by human activity has already knocked the next ice age off it's feet and we might have changed the planet enough to end the ice age cycle. The orbital forcing is believed to be only about 1 degree C but ice ages can be about 10 degrees C colder due to feedback mechanisms. Our man made increase in CO2 is expected to warm the earth more than that, so at current CO2 levels, it's entirely possible that an ice-age couldn't form. source quote: 

This is a very minimalist example of course, it only draws the coastlines (as a line by opposition to drawing the continents as polygons, that would allow a more advanced colouring scheme but the projection to mercator of polygons is more complex, as Antarctica creates problems). 

This is only a partial answer as it doesn't explain why the excess of O2 stayed but one thing you have to appreciate is the fact that aerobic respiration appeared almost half a billion years after photosynthesis, so we can't really say that photosynthesis and respiration have always balanced each other. Cyanobacteria (and with them photosynthesis) are believed to have appeared somewhen between 3 and 2.5Ga (e. g. Altermann & Kazmierczak 2003, Brocks et al. 2003) while Mitochondria (and with them aerobic respiration) are thought to have evolved somewhen between 2 and 1.5Ga (see e. g. Hedges et al. 2004). There was therefore at least half a billion year during which cyanobacteria were producing O2 with no one able to breathe it. 

Please take into consideration that I am not a specialist of plate tectonics, just a paleontologist. Although this cycle is often nicknamed the Wilson cycle (probably because of Wilson, 1966), the idea that supercontinent formed cyclically every 440Ma was advanced by Worsley et al. 1984 (see review on the subject by Nance & Murphy 2013). The mechanism they hypothesize for the breakup of the supercontinent is the mantle heat flow accumulating below the supercontinent while the formation of the supercontinents are bound by the cooling effect on the density of the oceanic lithosphere (see also Nance et al. 1988): so basically, heat accumulate below the insulating supercontinent until it causes it to break up, thus creating rifts and a new oceanic lithosphere, which, with age, cool down and thus become more dense making it more prone to be subducted by the continents (if I understood correctly). As to "why ca. 450 Ma?" this has probably to do with the cooling speed of the oceanic lithosphere, I would assume. Another important point: although there are evidences for the existence of a supercontinent breaking-up at 300 Ma (Pangaea), at 750 Ma (Rodinia), at 1.6 Ga (Nuna or Columbia), etc., there are also evidences for an absence of supercontinent at 1.2 Ga (see Pisarevsky et al. 2014), hinting that this cycle is maybe not that regular.

And your 2nd article This is at least partly semantics calling it "new" water. When we burn gasoline for example, the hydrocarbon structure becomes Water and CO2 - is that new water, or just re-arranging molecules by chemical reaction and fire? 

I can list the cycles and possible cycles that I know of. You mentioned the Milankovich cycles, 26,000 (or 21,000), 41,000 and about 100,000 (with some fluctuation), are pretty much like clockwork and are timed pretty well with historical ice ages, so those are confirmed cycles, but they also occur very slowly. The Sahara desert may cycle from lush rain forest to desert back to rain forest every 26,000 years. That said, the orbital changes are not thought to be a big factor today. We're likely in the middle of a warm period between ice ages, perhaps in a gradual cooling. Solar Minimums The sun cycles between high and low sunspot periods on roughly an 11 year cycle. High sunspot activity does give the Earth slightly more energy but the effect of this is pretty small, maybe 1/4 of 1 degree C maximum to minimum, less than the 1 degree plus that the CO2 has already warmed the earth. Still 1/4 of 1 degree can have an effect if the sun enters an extended minimum. This may be the cause of the little ice age. Maunder Minimum and Little Ice age A recent study suggested that the sun might enter a new long term (Maunder like) minimum and that it may happen every few hundred years, but the cooling from this is likely smaller than the warming already experienced from CO2. (I have a link, need to track it down) Ocean currents This is very complex and difficult to predict. We know that El Ninos and La Nina's tend to roughly alternate. El Nino's are associated with a warmer ocean current on the surface that warms teh air (and has numerous other global weather effects) and La Nina is a cooler ocean current on the surface that warms the air less/cools it more and there are also predictible weather effects all over the planet. La Nina and El Nino aren't exactly on a cycle any more than heavy snow fall winters and light snow fall winters are on a cycle, they're more like chance, for lack of a better word, though they must be caused by something but as far as I know there's no good predictive methods beyond a few months ahead of time. I think it's unlikely that La Nina and El Nino play key roles in global climate change though, but there's no definitive evidence. Longer term ocean currents are often used by climate change skeptics, like 30 year ocean cycles, because, if you squint just right, they can argue that the global temperature has risen and fallen on a 30 year cycle. (They really haven't), but it looks like there could be some truth to that. See chart here (for some reason I couldn't embed) $URL$ Source: $URL$ Now it looks like the Earth cooled 1880-1910, warmed 1910-early 1940s, cooled a little / stayed about flat 1940-1975 and warmed 1975 to present. It sounds like a good argument but 2 periods is much too short a time period to draw any good conclusions, especially if the argument is largely circumstantial without a clear cause and effect, and lets not forget, the warming since the 1970s has blown out of the water any measured 30 year period before then, so the current warming doesn't fit the model. Volcanoes While not really a "cycle" volcanoes can have measurable effects on climate, but only very large ones, so this happens maybe 1-2 times a century. The last cooling volcano happened in 1991 and may have cooled the earth about 1/2 of 1 degree, which is actually a lot, but it's also, quite temporary. A few years after the Volcano the Earth was setting heat records again and by 1998 with the large El Nino, global temperatures blew the previous records out of the water. Liars see chart here: $URL$ Roy Spencer suggests that during the medieval warm period it was 1 or 2 degrees hotter than today. I think he's basically lying because he's the only person producing charts like this. There's another scientist (I forget his name) who only studies the Greenland ice sheet which can be prone to local variations and not give a good picture of global temperatures. Locally there can be fairly significant temperature variation but, and this is important, there's a difference between natural variation and cycles. Cycles by definition have causes. Natural variation tends to be more local than global, though there are global variations year to year, where the biggest drivers are probably El Nino/La Nina and the occasional once in a century volcanic eruption. Other smaller effects like cloud cover and snow cover/reflection probably play roles too. But in a certain sense, all this is just movement of temperature and (OK clouds and snow can reflect solar energy away directly) but oceans, the primary cause used for cycles don't change the total heat in the system so much as they move it around. The sun, another commonly misused cause for cycles, doesn't vary enough to explain the current warming, so it's likely that most of the people saying "it's a cycle" are simply wrong. Though it's possible that part of the warming is riding a so far unexplained cycle, it's very unlikely that most of it is. The simplest way to look at climate change is energy in and energy out. $URL$ This is grossly over simplified but 29% of the suns energy is reflected directly back into space, 23% warms the atmosphere and 48% warms the surface. The earth, when in equilibrium, gives back the same amount of energy that it receives, of that 71%, only 12% radiates from the surface of the earth and 59% radiates into space from the atmosphere. Small changes in radiation away from the earth (which is how greenhouse gas works) gradually increase the total heat of the earth, and most of this heat goes into the oceans, some melts ice and only about 3% stays in the atmosphere, which slowly warms the atmosphere, the current estimate is about 2 degrees C every 100 years (and the ocean warming, likely even slower than that, maybe 1 degree on the surface every 100 years or more and even more gradual warming in the middle and deeper oceans. All that is very one-dimensional as it doesn't take into account evaporation and cloud formation, changes in plant transporation, changes in desert vs green land cover, changes in ice cover, humidity etc. It's a hugely complicated system, BUT, there is very good evidence that the atmosphere is trapping heat and the earth is taking in more energy from the sun than it is currently returning to space and that's the single most important bit of evidence. So called 30 year ocean cycles are very much worth studying but likely not causing and unlikely to prevent man made climate change. Solar cycles are worth studying and may even exist over every few centuries, but they are probably too small to prevent the greenhouse gas warming. Other "undiscovered" cycles, well, sounds good, but without a testable theory, that's not real science. That was probably too long, but there it is. 

Mass extinctions are selective: not all living organisms will be affected by it to the same extent. Meaning also that various groups will recover from it at various speed: a group from which half of the species were exterminated by the event will most probably take longer to recover (i. e. reach its pre-event diversity) than a group for which only 10% of the species are gone. And a group for which 95% of the diversity is gone is likely to never fully recover its initial diversity. If you are looking at the recovery of the ecosystem/biome as a whole, then what is likely to happen is that the extinct species left whole ecological niches vacant, meaning that this vacuum is likely to be quickly filled by new species (either species group that already existed and were already occupying this ecospace but were dominated by the now-extinct species or brand new species group). On that subject, one has to realise also that the recovery of a trophic level of an ecosystem is dependent on the recovery of the others (i. e. and to simplify, recovery of apex predators depends of the recovery of grazers, which depends on the recovery of primary producers etc.), so a mass extinction affecting primarily the primary producers might need longer to recover than one affecting mainly the apex predators. So is 10 Myr a short amount of time to recover from a mass extinction? I'll say that one would expect ecological recovery to be faster than that (see for instance the speed at which milieux disturbed by glacial episodes recover during interglacials, or the speed at which new islands get colonised). But for the complete recovery of global diversity (in particular for an event supposedly wiping out 90% of life diversity) i'd have expected it to take longer than 10 Myr. In the second article you link, the authors estimate that the recovery of the terrestrial ecosystem is fast by comparison with how long it took to colonise the land in the first place (i. e. 100 Myrs). But all the evolutionary adaptations needed to function on land do not need to be re-evolved, so it seems rational to expect it to take a shorter time than those 100 Myrs... Otherwise the probable reason the news article you linked considered it to be a long recovery time was to emphasise the fact that the article show that it took longer because of ripple effects of the Permo-Triassic event during the early Triassic that slowed down the recovery. In a review of mass extinction recovery predating those two articles, Erwin (1998) estimated the duration of the recovery from the End Ordovician, Frasian-Fammenian, end-Permian, end-Triassic and K/T extinction events (I mention here only the so-called "Big Five" extinctions) to, respectively, 7, 3, "3 to 9?", 3 and 2 millions years. With those number in mind, then indeed 10 Myrs is a long recovery. The same article also had this to say about the definition of mass extinction recovery: 

This is more Astronomy than Earth Science, but the Young Earth, while forming, would have had a hard time retaining Hydrogen. There's two reasons for this. One is the Frost Line which means there was relatively little hydrogen and relatively little water and other gases present when the Earth formed. And the other is Atmospheric Escape. The Earth doesn't have enough gravity to retain Hydrogen. In fact, the Earth is still losing Hydrogen, by this estimate, about 95,000 tons per year. 

TLDR, but here goes: There's a few factors to consider regarding the relatively tiny 2 degrees C and I'm not sure how to explain this without being long, but obviously you're correct, we hardly notice a 2 degree change ourselves. But if you look at the total energy of Earth you can get a slightly better picture. The numbers below are only approximations but should be close enough to give an idea of how the trapped heat plays in the Earth's atmosphere and oceans. The sun shines on the Earth about 1.8*10^17 Joules per second, or about 5.6*10^24 joules per year. Source. Remember that number, I'll reference it a few times. The rough division is about 48% of that hits the surface, 23% is absorbed in the atmosphere, 29% is reflected back into space. Source. Now, because the Earth is in largely in a stable equilibrium where energy in roughly equals energy out, the Earth radiates about the equivalent of 71% of that 5.6*10^24 joules per year that the sun shines on it, the other 29% being reflected. This will be obvious to some but I'll mention it anyway. Global warming has nothing to do with the sun giving the Earth more energy. It has to do with the Earth radiating less energy into space, at least until the Earth warms enough for a new equilibrium to re-stabilize the energy in = energy out. Raising the concentration of greenhouse gas changes the equilibrium of heat transfer. It's the same principal as putting on a sweater. Using the same link as above, 59 of that 71% radiates from Earth's upper atmosphere and the remaining 12% from the surface. For greenhouse gas driven climate change to work, the only way that can work is that the 59% needs to drop (OK, not the only way, you can also play with albedo). But heat is trapped in the lower atmosphere, the upper atmosphere cools and the 59% drops a little lower. Cloud cover and changes in Albedo such as snow cover, ocean cover and green vs desert are factors too, (the 29% mentioned above), but that gets enormously complicated, and beyond the scope of anything I can try to explain, so I'm going to ignore that for now and just look at the 59% of the 5.6*10^24 joules per year. Thermal radiation increases at roughly the 4th power of the temperature, so if we use the average temperature on Earth at about 288 Kelvin and add 2 degrees to that, the radiation difference between 288 Kelvin and 290 Kelvin using the 4th power rule is a 2.8% increase, or an increase from 12% to 12.34% of the 5.6*10^24. To keep the energy balance consistent, when a new equilibrium is reached, the 59% drops to 58.66% with 0.34% being "new heat" due to the additional greenhouse gas. This change presumably has already happened. In fact, today, the heat balance is out of equilibrium which is why the Earth is warming. The Earth is taking in more heat than it's giving back into space. 0.34% of 5.6*10^24 = 1.9*10^22 joules. By comparison, the combined energy use of all man-kind is about 1/40th of that, or about 5*10^20th Joules. Source. So, from a human perspective it's an enormous amount of energy but to the something the size of the Earth it's quite small. Needless to say, the 0.34% estimate is pretty rough, so take the numbers below with some flexibility, but they're also, at least somewhat in the range. Second, we have to consider where the heat is going. By most estimates, more than 90% of this goes into the oceans and about 90% or a bit more of the heat is going into the oceans with some melting ice, some going into the ground and melting tundra and only a small percentage going into the atmosphere where surface temperatures are calculated. Source, Source and Source (The first mentions a very specific 93.4% into the oceans and 2.3 into the Atmosphere. The last 2 mention "more than 90%" and "about 90%", so there might be some uncertainty on the precise ratio and I'm going to round up to 3%. Feel free to re-run the numbers with 2.3%, 4%, whatever you like. 3% of 1.9*10^22 = 5.8*10^20 (not a typo, it's actually 1.93) So the atmosphere, by rough estimates, adds about 5.8*10^20 joules of energy as a result of the increase in CO2. So, to estimate the expected warming from that amount of energy: The mass of the Atmosphere is about 5.1*10^21 grams. Source. About 4.2 joules can heat 1 gram of water 1 degree C. Source, and the specific heat of the atmosphere is about 1/4.1 that of water, Source. Of ocean water, slightly lower, I'm going to estimate 1/4.0 so, doing the maths: (4.0/4.2)*(5.1*10^21/5.8*10^20), my roughest of calculations says that we'd need about 9 years of trapped heat to warm the atmosphere 1 degree C. If we use skeptical sciences 2.3% number, that ups it to about 11.5 years, and both estimates are obviously too aggressive. The observed surface temperature warming is closer to 1 degree every 40-50 years, give or take, though the warming on land is faster than the warming over water. But my estimate can't help but be quite rough. It excludes albedo and cloud formation entirely, which is important, but trying to calculate is hugely complex and far above my pay-grade. It's difficult to calculate the effects of clouds on global warming even with super-computers. Now, obviously ocean currents, dictate varying amounts of heat exchanged between the ocean and the atmosphere, so one year to the next can vary by significantly more than 1/9th of 1 degree, but that's movement of heat, not new heat added to the system. Now if I calculate how long it would take to heat the oceans, and as I understand it, the deep oceans aren't warming, but the surface and sometimes called "mid-oceans" or mid-depth are warming, (articles here and here Using the numbers above, for 1 mile deep using with the estimate of about 33 times the heat going into the oceans than into the atmosphere, reapplying the specific heat of water to atmosphere ratio of 4 to 1 and estimating the mass of 1 mile of ocean water equivalent to about 160 atmospheres, adjusting for 71% of surface cover, it comes to a rough estimate of 124 years for my very rough heat trapping estimate to warm 1 mile of oceans about 1 degree C. I couldn't find any precise warming in the oceans, but 1 degree of warming, 1 mile deep in 124 years sounds roughly in the neighborhood of what the experts expect. (I think). So, long story short, while local temperature can change significantly over different parts of the day, global average temperature isn't nearly so easily changed. On a single day (using numbers above), the Earth gets 71% of 5.6*10^24/365 or about 1.1*10^22 joules, and an amount quite close to that radiates away from the earth every day too. Based on my very rough estimate, the difference between heat the Earth takes in and heat the Earth radiates is about 0.3%. On individual days you might get a fair bit bigger than a 0.3% difference, but there's still not enough heat added by 1 day of sunlight to significantly change the Earth's global average temperature. Now, obviously, the Earth's surface warms measurably under daylight but that's because 48% of the suns energy reaches the surface directly and the heat is localized, and while 1/2 of the Earth's surface warms the other half cools, so it tends to average out. There's insufficient energy in sunlight to make much change to global average temperature over a short period of time. With that in mind, the 2 degrees that the IPCC discusses, which includes ocean heat trapping, is quite significant. It more likely works out to about 3 degrees on land, 1.5 degrees over water, with rising oceans due to both thermal expansion and melting ice. Warmer oceans means bigger hurricanes. It's easy to say "2 degrees won't matter", but the models say it actually might. It's a pretty significant variation. It also takes quite a bit of time for the 40% increase in CO2 to create that much warming, which is why the projections of 2 degrees warming go out to about 2100. Another way to point out lack of global temperature variation is to look at the charts for global average temperature. while, I couldn't find any charts for daily variation of average global temperatures, I found some monthly variation charts here. Source. Assuming the monthly averages have gotten more accurate in recent decades, The average global temperature change month to month is about 0.13 degrees C over land and about 0.095 degrees C over oceans since 1980, with the largest month to month variation about 0.47 degrees C over land 0.36 over oceans. There's probably some rounding errors in there, but there's clearly a degree of consistency to global average surface temperature and even more consistancy to surface temperature over the oceans, and that's exactly what we should expect, having looked at the heat in and heat out. Local affects are driven by circulation, but circulation is simply the moving of heat from one place to another. Circulation isn't the creation of heat but the behavior of heat and differences in air pressures and it doesn't measurably add any heat to the system. Corrections to my too long answer welcome. 

You can find gridded topography and bathymetry data, freely accessible, on the website of the NOAA. For instance you have the ETOPO1 dataset here. Once you downloaded it you can work it out with your favourite GIS software or GIS-supporting programming language. The equations to calculate the volume based on the gridded cells is given on this page from the NGDC website. 

In addition to what @Michael said, one can add that the claim that "geologist date rocks by the fossils they contain and date fossils by the rocks in which they are found" is misleading: are some rocks being dated using fossils? Yes. Are some fossils being dated by the rock they are contained in? Yes. But they are not the same fossils or the same rocks in both cases! An example using marine micropaleontology (both because this is what I know best, but also because this is the discipline in which biostratigraphy is the most commonly used): some marine sections (not all) have unique sedimentary properties that allow the use of geochronological tools, or the use of magnetostratigraphy. But those sections are in practice a minority, so what we do is that we use the "good" sections as references: on those, we look at abundant microfossils having a clearly marked first and/or last occurrence, as a bio-datum. And then we use those datums on the other sections to estimate their age. Eventually other microfossils are found on those sections and therefore their age are estimated this way. But those microfossils won't be used to date anything. 

I gave a longer answer linked to a similar question in the comments above, I'll give a quick one here: 

I'm by no means an expert, but this Wikipedia link suggests that oceans make plate tectonics more likely, not less likely: $URL$ So, a planet with twice the surface water as earth, covered by oceans might have almost no land but I think it's unlikely oceans would stop plate tectonics cause the heat still has to go somewhere, and it either circulates and pulls plates with it or it doesn't and it had the occasional volcano as the only means of releasing heat (Even Mars still has the very occasional volcano, and perhaps the Moon as well) Now if the oceans are 150 or 200 miles deep like Europa - I don't know what kind of effect that would have but just having oceans over the whole planet, I don't think that would likely prevent plate tectonics. My guess is that mostly water worlds would still have plate tectonics most of the time, provided the planet itself is one that has plate tectonics. 

Lyle et al. (2007), prior to the paper you mention, also came up with this idea that the ACC initiated with its modern setting (i. e. with strong currents and mixing throughout the water column) during the Late Oligocene (ca. 25 Ma), so roughly 10 Myr after the Eocene-Oligocene when the antarctic glaciation is thought to have occurred. Their evidence is based on sedimentology, specifically the presence of erosional structure associated with deep current flow. They however don't discard in this paper the idea that a surface ACC existed prior to this. The original idea (Kennett 1977) according to which the ACC started near the Eocene-Oligocene transition was based on the observation of biogenic sedimentary facies pattern (classically siliceous south of the ACC and carbonaceous north) coupled with the observation of the opening of the Drake Passage around that time. Later, observations of the establishment of an endemic antarctic planktonic fauna during the latest Eocene (e. g. Lazarus & Caulet 1993, Lazarus et al. 2008) and measurement of Nd isotopes (Scher & Martin, 2006) at Agulhas Ridge (i. e. south of Africa) that coincides with Pacific waters values strengthened that hypothesis. However, the idea that the antarctic glaciation was a consequence of the setting of the ACC has been somewhat challenged (De Conto & Pollard, 2003, and later Barker & Thomas, 2004) based mainly on numerical modeling, as they show that, although a developed ACC would have participated in the cooling triggering the glaciation, it is not a necessary condition for it: the glaciation could have entirely been caused by the observed drop of atmospheric $p_\mathrm{CO_2}$, even without a developed ACC. Additionally, some of the evidences for an early setting of the ACC (namely the facies change argument) could very well be a consequence of the glaciation rather than the consequence of the ACC (Barker & Thomas, 2004). So, as far as I see, we are at a stand-off, where we have arguments in favor of a late settling of the ACC (mostly sedimentary and tectonic arguments) and at the same time arguments in favor of an early settling (in particular paleontological and geochemical arguments) and no real reason to discard any.

A quick google search will answer this question for you. Read some of those, and if you still have questions, come back and ask. This really, really, really has been answered, again and again and again and again. If you have trouble, I can post some explanations for you. 

The 2nd part, the change in salinity is (to my knowledge, and I invite correction from anyone who studies this professionally), but from what I've read, it's much more complicated to model than LHF. It's certainly something that researchers are aware of, both the warming arctic and changes in salinity might effect ocean currents. Unlike air, where temperature drives density and that leads to low and high pressure and updrafts and basically, weather, oceans have two factors that can effect water density - temperature and salinity. Warm water is lighter than cold water, but lower salinity water is also lighter than warmer, more salty water. Small changes in salinity in ocean surface water doesn't have any real effect on temperature directly, but the effect on ocean currents is worth studying because changes in ocean currents can effect temperature significantly, certainly on a local scale, and globally too. Modelling this, like modeling the rate of future glacial melt, may be close to impossible and when it's written about, it can sound more alarmist than science, so it's a subject that has 2 key problems, difficult to predict (even in the hard to predict climate change models the effect of salinity changes on ocean currents are especially tricky), and it's the kind of thing that might invite shouts from the other side, like Wiesław Masłowski's infamous study that suggested the arctic might be ice-free by 2013. He was a graduate student, not a climate scientist and his was a good study and preliminary. It should have been subject to peer review, instead, (in part because Al Gore used his study in a speech), it became a famous example to alarmism and was subject to much ridicule that persists to this day. Scientists are certainly aware of the possible effects of salinity changes and the effect that might have on ocean currents, but it's very difficult to model and mostly written about observed effects in the present, and mostly not written regarding future forecasts. Predictions like "the Atlantic current could shut down" may be based in science, but low probability predictions like that tend to invite criticism. Fresh water/ice melt is discussed in Wikipedia here and here's an article where the opposite is happening. As arctic sea ice recedes, the lighter, less salty water on top isn't present as much as it used to be and the arctic-ocean stratification is going away. Article on that here. It's also worth noting that glacier fed rivers will affect the ecosystem down-river, putting less or more water into the environment leading to less or more greening and less or more water evaporating off the river into the atmosphere. It's more common for rivers to be fed by snow melt than glacial melt, but the glacial melt should be studied too. Changes in greening down-river and in atmospheric water vapor also effect climate, so, as someone said in the comments, there are a lot of moving parts to the climate picture. Generally speaking, scientists are aware of all of this and as much as possible, study it and include it in models. 

I'm not going to give an extensive account on "mass extinction" epistomology here but I think the first thing one has to consider is the difficulty of studying numerically paleobiodiversity (mostly because of a gappy fossil record but also an historically unbalanced sampling effort and the rock availability for some of the time periods); although, along the years, we designed better tools to compensate for those biases (see the whole bibliography of John Alroy for instance), this is still a major issue. Furthermore, the recognition of the "Big Five" (i. e. the five bigger mass extinctions of the Phanerozoic: End Ordovician, Late Devonian, Permian/Triassic boundary, Triassic/Jurassic boundary and Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary) basically derive from the work of Sepkoski (1978, 1979; Raup & Sepkoski 1981, etc...) who studied the diversity of marine biota and more specifically (judging by Sepkoski 1981) marine metazoans. As a consequence everything terrestrial and every non-metazoan (plants, protists, bacteria) are not included in the classic recognition of those events. It so happens that at least the P-T and the K-Pg events have been also recognized in some marine protists (namely foraminifera) and in terrestrial vertebrates (dinosaurs for the K-PG and many groups of 'pelycosaurs' for the P-T to name the more famous); but conceptually this is a significant bias as it may happen that the geological event driving one of those mass extinctions can only affect marine organisms (oceanic anoxia being the most obvious example). That's for the epistemology part. Now the plants themselves: as you noticed with your quote of Traverse (1988) it is thought that the Embryophyta (i. e. land plants) have not been affected by the Big Five. This idea have since then been somewhat challenged (e. g. McElwain & Punyasena 2007) with evidences that plants indeed were affected by some of those extinctions but maybe not as drastically as what we think happened for marine faunas or terrestrial vertebrates. It needs to be considered however that the earliest evidences for the existence of land plants date from the Silurian (see Kenrick & Crane 1997 for a short review). Their fossil record remains extremely gappy until the Carboniferous, basically, meaning that the first two of the "Big Five", if they happened to have affected land plants, can not be observed. Additionally Angiosperms appeared in the early Cretaceous and diversified significantly toward the end of the Cretaceous, meaning that if the K-Pg event had an effect on the other land plants, the number of extinctions in those groups would be drowned by the number of originations in Angiosperms (I don't have any reference for that, it is just food for thought). Finally, land plants are not the only group that doesn't dance to the beat imposed by the Big Five. For instance there is evidence that radiolarians (a group of marine heterotrophic planktonic protists with an extensive, continuous fossil record) were not affected by the K-Pg crisis (Hollis et al. 1995) nor by the T-J event (Kießling & Danelian 2011). There are still thought to have been, to some extent, affected by the P-T but there is no clear evidence (to my knowledge) for them being affected by the two previous crisis either. And of course there is the multitude of groups with no (or minimal) fossil record (because they have no fossilizable parts for instance and thus are only recorded in extremely rare occasions) for which we have literally no idea of what happened to them.
