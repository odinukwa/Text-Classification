Ok. Well, given the nature of the routine, this question is kind of ambiguous. Maintenance in this case may be considered maintaining a certain weight (since the routine suggests it's a weight loss routine), or it could mean conditioning level (since this routine involves a significant amount of metabolic conditioning). Or, maybe it's both. Let's examine the possibilities. After you've finished your routine and you have achieved a weight that you wish to maintain, you could simply cut out the conditioning altogether and reduce your caloric intake to match the needs of your physique. You'll notice muscle atrophy since you aren't conditioning any longer, and you'll have to taper caloric intake accordingly. Conversely, you could try to be formulaic about your conditioning to match the caloric consumption of the last few weeks of your R4FL routine. In this case, you would need to try to keep your diet as constant as possible as well. Let's assume it's both: you continue with your current diet, and for lack of ideas, you continue repeating the last few weeks of the routine. Unless you're dumping tons of refined starches and sugars into your body at every meal, you'll probably continue to lose weight. Those types of interval training sessions are extremely demanding. (If I may interject my own experience, I've seen 1000+ calories burned in the span of 20 minutes of high intensity intervals.) Furthermore, I think that it would be difficult for you to repeat your intervals at exactly the intensity you performed them at the previous time, just because you'll be in better shape. You'll perform them better, faster, and with more calories. Since intervals also introduce an anaerobic element to your training, you'll also be putting on muscle. Muscle require more calories to "own and operate". It's difficult to answer this question exactly. I suppose ultimately when you finish this routine, you'll want to decide what you want to do. What type of exercise do you like doing? Do you just want to not be fat? Do you just want to run 60 minutes? Do you like doing intervals? Do you want to do both? Do you want to do neither? If you keep it up, the fat will stay off -- and likely continue coming off. If you don't keep it up, you'll have to play a game of weights and balances to eat just the right amount. In the long term (if your goal is strictly aesthetics), the type of routine you do will start to shape your physique in different directions. Distance running will give more of "stringy" physique, where intervals will give you a more "lean" or "fit" physique. If you're bored of running, maybe try doing something like following the crossfit.com main website's daily workout routines (there's pretty much something new and challenging every day -- check here for a scaled version of the workout of the day). I can refine my answer for you given some feedback. 

The myofibril (called out above) are the packs of fibers in the muscle, which are responsible for contraction of the tissue. They're composed of many sarcomeres linked together. Sarcomeres are sort of like -- for lack of a better analogy -- stacks of velcro that can pull themselves together. Thousands of little motor proteins called myosin are attached together and run along filaments inside these sarcomeres, each one acting sort of like this: $URL$ Below is the classic diagram of a sarcomere. Don't get too caught up in the terminology here, but you can see the myosin heads are all married together and skip along the actin filaments, contracting the sarcomere, and thus contracting the myofibril: 

I've heard/read olympic weightlifting trainers Glenn Pendlay and John Broz and various olympic weightlifting athletes -- Clarence Kennedy for example -- say (and I will try to cite these when I get a moment) that training anything other than the recruitment patterns utilized while performing the movement is a waste. And that makes sense. Becoming exceptionally good at something means practicing it, not practicing other things. You don't see oly lifters doing bench press, because nowhere in the movement they wish to master is a bench press included. The same mentality should be adopted for any movement pattern. If you wish to be exceptionally good at throwing trash bags in the back of a garbage truck, be a garbage man, not a swimmer. Now, say a portion of the movement is identified as a weakness. Continuing our oly lifting example, say (to simplify things greatly) the lifter is able to jerk more weight than he can clean, a partial movement pattern may be practiced to train the lifter on strengthening his or her weakness (in this case, the lifter would work more on the clean portion of the movement). The same mentality could be adopted for improving on weaknesses in any portion of the movement. In the case of pedal stroke, this would likely require some analysis on a dynamometer or from a professional. This boils down to your goals. If you wish to be a competitive cyclist, losing muscle mass in every part of your body other than what is needed for pedaling is beneficial and desirable. That's the extreme end of the spectrum. If you wish to also play football on weekends, train other stuff. In regards to injury potential, that's completely subjective. Are you worried about injuring yourself walking down the street, or trying to flip an 800lb tractor tire? If it's the latter, then, yes, your leg muscles may be so powerful that they can pull your spinal erectors if you have not practiced the muscle recruitment pattern of flipping a tire. The same is true for most things. Try sprinting at full bore after having only done body building movements for a whole year. Should weightlifting be used to strengthen underutilized muscles? I think this is a poor question. How do you define underutilized? Do you mean underutilized in cycling? Do you wish to improve on your cycling? If you want to get good at weightlifting, lift weights. If you want to get good at pedaling, pedal. If you want to get good at pedaling on 100km courses that are entirely uphill, pedal on 100k uphill courses. Progressive overload is the essence of all training. 

People under the age of 18 are ingesting plenty of creatine as it is. None of the claims presented on the bottles of creatine supplements are evaluated by the FDA anyway -- any substantiations they present are bogus. 

As a 260 lb gentleman with 30%+ bodyfat, you may find 20 strict ring dips a challenging feat. For that reason, sites like CrossFit Brand X exist, where a pro scales the workout for you every day. (For example, see various options for the scaled version of that same workout here). You may not find it necessary to look at the scaled versions, but rather take cues from the workout and scale it yourself. One benefit of CrossFit workouts is that they generally require very little equipment. If equipment is prescribed, there is likely a variation you could choose that would not require any equipment. However, if you find you'd like to stick only to bodyweight movements, there are a number of sites available listing only bodyweight Crossfit WODs, such as this one. Futhermore, it's easy to document your progress with these workouts by timing yourself. It's enjoyable to see how far you've come by doing the same workout two weeks or a month later. It also keeps you goal-oriented during your training, and forces you to strive for a better score during the workout. I know there are a lot of CrossFit naysayers (particularly in the bodybuilding community), and I don't want to come off as a CrossFit fanboy, so I should disclaim that I personally have no affiliation, do not visit a CrossFit gym, and don't work out in a group setting. I simply value the enormous body of information made available by the CrossFit community. Stripping away the stigma, one finds a great resource for varied workouts they can use to spice up their own training regimen. Depending on your goals, you may find sites like CrossFit Football and CrossFit Gymnastics useful (or at least see some workouts you may enjoy on them). For conditioning, I really like CrossFit workouts because they keep me from getting bored. I generally end up choosing a good 10 or 15 workouts, then put them on rotation during my conditioning phases. Aside from that, you may also enjoy the Wendler 5/3/1 program. I realize you may have limited access to free weights, so this may not be an option. However, if you find that it is an option, I recommend acquiring the PDF, which is a pretty short read but loaded with useful information and motivation. In any case, I've found during strength training, following Wendler's advice of doing hill sprints for 20 minutes three times a week has really melted the fat off of me. As it seems you're aware, diet also plays a significant role in achieving your goal. You'll probably need to lose the sweet tooth, lay off the booze, and start adopting healthy eating practices. I've had the most success by cooking meals for the week every weekend, measuring them out, and putting them in tupperware containers. Not only will this get you in the habit of eating the right amount, but the meals will be convenient and it will be difficult to consciously stray from your diet. I want to leave you with one final thought for being successful with your goal: try the 3/3/3 approach. Set up your routine and diet and try it for three days. After three days, you'll see how easy it would be to keep it up for three weeks. After three weeks, you'll have easily adopted the habits, and choosing to continue for three months will be no challenge. At the end of your three months, you'll have reached a profound change in physique, and have adopted the lifestyle you have set out to achieve. Good luck! 

You can find out more about that exercise here. There are some other examples in this section of the thigh exercise page on exrx. A google search for "hip adduction" or "hip adduction exercises" should give you a lot more direction on the movement if you would like to find out more. 

I find that the clean and jerk performed at a moderate weight for numerous repetitions is unmatched for this purpose. My favorite way to train at high intensity with this movement is called "death by clean and jerk". On a running timer, one clean and jerk is performed the first minute, two performed the second minute, three the third minute, and so on, until failure. You can see Mikko Salo perform this ladder in a very impressive way here. 

When you attempt to weight train, your feedback mechanisms (tactile, visual, and proprioceptive) may detect that nothing is happening, which maybe means you'll further invigorate the muscle with a stronger signal and more ATP is generated, more myosin are recruited, and more tension is generated. But -- as your question states -- say you'd like to maintain just two pounds of muscle cells for your specified muscle group. What variables contribute to the effectiveness of the muscle? In other words, how effective can those two pounds of muscle be? Well, depending on how you train, the myocytes may develop to be more densely composed of myofibril, or they may develop with a beefier sarcoplasmic reticulum (which is the part of the cell that generates ATP), or some where in the middle. If myofibril development is favored, much higher tension can be achieved in the muscle cell, because there is more fiber and more myosin to run along it. This would be desirable if one were training for a higher 1RM. On the other hand, if sarcoplasmic reticulum is favored in cellular development, the muscle would have fewer fibers, but under anaerobic conditions it could endure longer. This means there would be more strength endurance -- perhaps in this case it would be desirable if one were training for a 6, 8, or 12 RM (or some variation of that time under tension). So to answer your question, how the muscle is trained will determine the myofibril and sarcoplasmic development of the muscle, and ultimately the effectiveness of a muscle under certain stimuli. If the muscle group is forced to remain at a certain weight, the type of training done will dictate how good it becomes at an action, and thus the density of their respective cellular structure. As diet permits, minor anabolic and catabolic metabolism will allow this transformation to occur as the result of training. Take olympic weightlifters for example: they maintain a certain weight class and train in 1RM modalities. They develop extraordinary myofibril muscle. On the other end of the spectrum are bodybuilders, who train for effective sarcoplasmic reticulum in their muscle. The appearance of the muscle is different, as is the density. An elite 180 lb bodybuilder would look quite different than an elite 180 lb olympic weightlifter of equal height. These are two "end-of-chain" variables, yet there may be others in the pathway that need consideration, such as how good the neurons become at signaling the cells for contraction, or how well the brain is trained to recruit the muscle. Part of weight training is reducing the number of feedback loop iterations that sort of "nickel and dime" that pathway. For example, in the space of milliseconds, the system may behave like so: am I applying enough effort? no I am not -- must apply more effort. how about now? not yet, more effort. You could see how this and other neuromuscular scenarios may deplete anaerobic resources and reduce effectiveness. Hope that helps.
