One reason for this is, it is a tradition and is the ideal wood for this. Normally all the cricket bats are made of english willow and they are still following that tradition. As per Wiki the other reason is, it is very tough and shock-resistant, not being significantly dented nor splintering on the impact of a cricket ball at high speed, while also being light in weight. In 1979, Australian cricketer Dennis Lillee used an ComBat aluminium metal bat, but after getting the complaints from English team, Australian captain Greg Chappell asked him to revert to the wooden bat. Later Kookaburra released another type of bat that had a Carbon fiber-reinforced polymer but that was also banned by ICC. 

Play Schedule is basically decided by the cricket boards of both countries. However ICC has to approve this. The hosting country will decide on the venue in which play should happen, but ICC has to approve this as well. If they feel that pitch is dangerous for play, they can ask hosting team to change venue. Only countries with test status given by ICC can play official test matches. Otherwise it won't be considered as an official international match. 

Perhaps unsurprisingly, no! Should this actually happen, the ground staff would most likely remedy the situation with earth, sand and turf, following up by repainting the spot. In a penalty shootout, and where the ground staff could not fix the hole, I would imagine that the referee would have the penalties taken at the opposite end of the pitch. 

A lot is said in football about the referee's "interpretation" of the rules in a match. In the interpretation of this law, we should look closely at the term "immediately". You will very rarely see a referee award a free kick against a player who passes or shoots with an un-booted foot. The player is at a disadvantage by being missing a boot so the generally-seen interpretation is that the player has had his shoe removed by accident. With regards to the immediacy of the event, you're not likely to see a player running around for 15 minutes without a boot so pretty much any time from the loss of the boot up to the next time there is a break in the play could be deemed (interpreted) as immediate. To sum up the interpretation as simply as possible; if the player has lost a boot and he hasn't had chance to replace it, then he will not have a foul awarded against him. Earlier this year, Alessandro Matri scored for Juventus wearing no boot on his right foot. 

The short answer is NO. Home team is not supposed to set the boundary as they wish. Some rules are applied for boundary setting as well. Even though the home team is responsible for setting up the ground. As per ICC Standard Playing Conditions, the minimum and maximum size of the playing surface. Law 19.1 of ICC Test Match Playing Conditions states: 

As per ICC's rules, a captain will be fined 20% of his match fee per one over for the offence. Each player of the team is also fined 10% per over. If the captain is guilty of "Serious Over Rate Offence", he will be was banned from one match. Here the important thing is: 

The short answer is NO. The players were asked to select the team before the start of CLT20 and Sangakkara chose Maroons team. So he will not be able to reverse his decision in the middle of the tournament. Also from the cricinfo news: 

In addition to the execution (E) score, there is a separate panel of judges scoring the difficulty (D) score. This comprises of three elements: Difficulty Value (DV), Composition Requirements (CR) and Connection Value (CV). 

2005 Italian GP - September 4, 2005 Kimi Räikkönen qualified with the fastest time but was given a 10-place grid penalty for changing his engine. Juan Pablo Montoya took up pole position as a result. 2007 Hungarian GP - September 4, 2005 Fernando Alonso recorded the fastest time in qualifying but a stewards' inquiry before the race adjudged Alonso to have impeded Lewis Hamilton during Q3. Alonso was subsequently relegated 5 places on the starting grid, moving Hamilton up to pole. 2012 Spanish GP - May 13, 2012 In this event, Lewis Hamilton was excluded from the qualifying results due to having insufficient fuel to return to the pits. As a result, Hamilton had to start the race from the very back of the grid. 2012 Monaco GP - May 27, 2012 The fastest qualifier at Monaco was Michael Schumacher. However, Schumacher was carrying a 5-grid penalty from the previous race in Spain for causing an avoidable collision with Bruno Senna, thus moving him back in the grid. and it nearly happened in: 1990 Japanese GP Ayrton Senna had secured pole position but was unhappy that pole was situated on the side of the track which was not on the racing line. Senna requested that he be moved and the stewards agreed, only for the FISA president to overrule the decision, meaning Senna started in pole at the original location. And to close, you ask: 

Theoretically it is possible to score as many runs as possible since none of the cricket laws are putting a limit on that. So the answer is infinity. And yes, what you have mentioned is possible. But if a fielder throws the ball after picking from the ground it won't be a six, but a four. So it will be 9 runs. 

It is a method is used in cricket to calculate the target score when the match is interrupted and the required quota is not completed. Most of the time this is used for matches which were stopped due to rain. An alternative method for this is Jayadevan's_Rain rule. Please note that DL method is what used in all international matches nowadays. You can get more details from this wikipedia article: 

This is a normal scenario in cricket and I have seen this happened many times. It was always the in-form batsman or the batsman who has already settled down there used to stay and other one used to give up. I am not sure there was any argument like that happened ever because since both players play for same team, one batsman who made the mistake used to give up. In case both are not willing to give up and the players never crossed each other while running, the person who is not in his crease will be judged out. If they had already crossed each other, then the other person will be judged out since batsmen crossing each other means that they have switched the ends while running and they failed to make it completely to the opposite crease. So in your case, if A had played the ball and never crossed B while running to B's crease and run out happened at A's end, A will be judged out. If they crossed in the middle pitch, B will be out. Hope that makes it clear. 

Now, you'll notice from the image I posted that the buzzer flags look like ordinary assistant flags. In your question, you ask why the 5th and 6th officials have these wands. What you'll actually find is that all of the officials are adopting these pager and communication systems. The 5th and 6th officals' wands look more like simply flag-handles. This is because there is nothing in the laws of the games catering for flag signals by these two goal-line assistants - therefore they don't have the yellow and red flag fabric on them. The assistant referees will accompany their paging by the mandated flag signal as well. Sources 

In addition to the financial benefits detailed in Dor Cohen's answer, Spain also achieved: Fifa World Ranking Points Spain will have picked up a considerable number of Fifa World Ranking points by winning this tournament and via the manner in which they did so. With continental cup tournaments carrying a 3.0x multiplier, Spain will have further cemented their World #1 status. Source Record This is the first time in history that a team has won 3 back-to-back major tournaments, those being: 

The amount paid to the players are based on their availability for the matches. If a player was available for all the IPL matches, then that player is eligible for the full amount. If the players were not available for some matches, then they are paid on a pro-rata basis. In the above case, Ponting and Maxwell were available for the entire season. Missing a match due to injury or benching is not considered as unavailability and hence they should be getting the full amount. There was a rule that if a player was available for a certain no of matches and misses only a certain no of games, they should be paid the full amount. Not sure if this rule is still there. Also note that the amount offered to the players vary based on certain other criteria as well. For eg:- if the team didn't qualify for CL, players will get only 80% of the auction rate. Players also might get some % of amount if their team wins the IPL or finishes at 2/3/4. However there is no clarity on this and it depends on the team. Players also have to pay the income tax in India for the money they earned. Source: News, read somewhere 

It is my understanding that the term has military origins. A red zone in military terms is the danger zone, generally close to the enemy (red having been a symbol for danger for a long time). The term is analogous to sport as the last 20/22 is where you are more likely to suffer the danger of conceding to the opponent. I see that Merriam Webster has the first usage in sport at 1983 but the military/danger use predates that somewhat. Indeed, there is the 1966 film, "Red Zone Cuba", which is centered around a military facility. During World War I, the decimated areas of France were known as the Red Zone. To sum up my answer, the term "Red Zone" has been used in various contexts as a term for danger. Its application in sport is to represent the danger of your enemy and it was first coined by ex-Redskins coach Joe Gibbs in 1982. 

Yes, it is still counted for his career stats. Just because a match is called off doesn't mean that the stats wont be recorded for that match. It will be still recorded as "abandoned due to rain" and any runs scored or wicket taken will be added to the stats of corresponding players. The proof can be seen in this stat page of Lumb. You can see that in the innings by innings list, his score of 2 is also added and the total scored by him in that series is shown here as 31(29 + 2) at an average of 15.50. If it was not included, his average would have been 29 from the first match. The same applies for your second scenario as well. If a batsman scores 250, he will get the credit for it and it will be added in his career stats. 

It is not unlawful to field between bowler and side screen. In fact there is a fielding position for that and it is called straight hit.
