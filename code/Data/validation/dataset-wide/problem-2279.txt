TLDR: Climb easy routes up and down (e.g. for warm-up), and soon you will be much more comfortable climbing down in general. 

There is not much to add to Ben Crowell's great answer, just one point. So the next paragraph is merely a short version of his answer, skip to the second if you do not want to read it. If you have a good reason to believe that the second is not badly injured, lowering would be the first thing to try. Just slowly and not much at first. Climbing the wrong way and getting stuck without a way out due to being pulled by the rope is quite a common thing to happen. If that does not resolve the situation just as mentioned, proceed as in an improvised rescue: Start improvising. If you have enough rope, lower yourself down to establish contact. If you cannot abseil far enough as the rope is too short, you can lower on the rope the second is climbing on. Just use the exact same technique as in ascending on a rope: Two blocking knots, one attached to your harness, the other as a descending aid. Non strategic protections can just be unclipped, otherwise you may need to do a blocking knot below and then untie the one on top, but with some fiddling you might even slide it through the biner of the protection. It is slow, cumbersome and tiring, but an option to descend on a taught rope if nothing else works. Just be careful if the rope is forced against the rock: Trying to get your blocking knots past such an area may get you stuck and thus block you. 

Very important: Even reversible stage 1 frost bite makes you more vulnerable for frostbite in the future [1,2]. There seems to be a training effect if you expose your skin to the cold without frostbite though [2]. So yes it is possible that your face is trained to take more cold, while if you kept your hands in gloves all the time, the might take less before getting frostbite. However nose and ears are usually the very first places to get frostbite. It is hard to detect by yourself, as feeling is impaired already before frostbite hits in and you can't inspect visibly (I don't assume you carry a mirror ;) ). Otherwise the best measure is to pinch the nose and see whether it regains colour. If it doesn't, you are at serious risk (if not already in frostbite). Get to a warm place and/or try covering it. As a non-representational illustration of different training: I wouldn't stay below -25degC in windy conditions without covering my face at all. When skitouring I always cover my face (as in pull down hat and pull up tube scarf) if there is significant wind (and temps usually -20-0degC). 

I will not address the issue of whether the helmet in question is still usable or should be retired but instead answer the main question: How to wash a foam helmet? Generally water must not damage any kind of helmet you want to use for climbing, as it has to be usable in long constant rain. So rinsing with water without additives is certainly save. The manufacturer of my helmet (Kong Scarab) advices to use warm (<40degC) water with a mild detergent to clean the helmet and even describe a procedure to disinfect it: Put the helmet for an hour in a water bath with sal ammoniac in it. Not that I can ever imagine me having the need to disinfect my helmet, but it clearly states that it does not hurt the helmet. In short: In general a wet cloth should be enough, but you can rinse with or even submerge in water if it is very dirty. If this screws up the foam, it had to be replaced anyway. 

Snow shoes. Not just any snow shoes, but those with metal edges and crampon-like teeth below the foot. They increase your traction on slush a lot and if you encounter ice on the top or get deep enough for ice contact, the metal will provide you with traction. This traction on ice is obviously very limited by the non-ideal force transfer from your feet to the snow-shoes, but for limited steepness it works. For steeper slopes with ice, there is no alternative to crampons (with antibott (plastic at the bottom to make snow fall off)). I deep slush it is very strenuous to walk with snow-shoes, but the same is true with hiking boots - so I assume you are used to that. 

It depends on the thickness of the mattress and the ground below it. With a very thick mattress and a level ground, it's the opposite: Less air is softer/more comfortable.** The thinner the mat or the less even the ground (e.g. roots), the bigger the chance that you "touch" the ground (i.e. only compressed foam in between) - usually that happens at your hip (highest load) or wherever the protruding feature (e.g. root) is. In that case more air means more load distribution over the mattress and thus more "ground-clearance", meaning you are less likely to "touch" the ground. So while the mat is stiffer, it is still a lot softer/more comfortable than "touching" the ground. ** That's obviously an oversimplification: There is an optimal point in this case. At some point less air will also feel less comfortable. When that point is reached is individual, as with regular mattresses too. 

Whenever you store your snowboard and do not intend to use it the next day again (unless you really like your board), then do the following 

For long and/or big diameter ropes I recommend to use some variant of the butterfly coil (just google it, there are lots of instructions available). This is much faster to do and does give no twists, does not get loose and is great for transport. 

For my answer I make the following two assumptions: You either have someone who can show you the techniques involved, you have access to some courses to teach it or you are a very serious self-taught person. In any case I will suggest tours to gain experience on your own after you learned the techniques (at least theoretically). I am based in Switzerland near Zurich and do not know the Chamonix or Venice area, so I will talk about a location close to Zurich. The key abilities to do Mont Blanc guided are rope handling, glacier and steep snow techniques. So that is what I propose: The area in Glarus around the mountain "Toedi" is perfectly suited for all levels of such trainings. It is located at 2.5h by train or 1.5h by car from Zurich airport (overwiew / detailed map). Your base would be the hut "Claridenhuette" (red marker below the glacier) which is accessible either walking from "Tierfehd" (red marker) or from "Urnerboden" (red marker) via the cable car to "Fisetengrat" and from there to the hut. From there the possibilies are endless. For the very beginning there is a flat glacier nearby, where walking on crampons with a rope on a glacier, walking on sloped snow, crevasse rescue ... can be trained. To apply these newly learned skills you can do a tour on eg "Clariden" which is basically a long walk on the glacier with a moderately steep (max 40deg) incline at its end. Many more tours to be made. When you have gained more experience, the tour to the "Toedi" is very similar to the Mount Blanc save the altitude. There are also huge crevassed areas, steep slopes and long distances. But this tour is already quite advanced. Anyway you can easily get to the hut using the maps I showed you and then you will see the possibilities yourself or can ask the personel, they will gladly point you to suited areas for training. Of course there are also various guided courses available there, but they are expensive. For additional training the region of Zermatt (4h by train from Geneva) offers great tours in moderate difficulty.
