When we work, we give something and receive something. When we love, the exact same thing happens. When we buy an apple, the exact same thing happens. Such exchanges of something are called interactions. You can take a look to references and my draft of a theory of interaction on $URL$ It would be related to the theory of systems. When two entities interact, each one can get a positive or negative benefit. Win-win is one of nature's amazing phenomenon. Under normal conditions, job/work is a win/win exchange. Your brother wins money, his clients win some service/product. Win/win exchanges end up in interactions being repeated. The big problem regarding to earning money raises on win/lose situations. Win/lose is also a common result, which is perfectly achievable and positive on the short term (you can steal ONE wallet an perhaps pass unnoticed). The problem becomes on the long term: win/lose cause interactions to cease repeating. On simple words, your brother can get temporary high benefits from some clients which end up losing, but soon he will lose all chances to continue interacting with any other clients. And here's the point to your question: your brother future commercial interaction trends depend on his focusing: to give (tends to win/win) or to receive (tends to win/lose). Imagine he's a doctor. Focusing on receiving will cause him to use less resources on healing (patients lose) in order to earn more (he wins). Focusing on giving will cause him to use the best resources on healing, despite minor earnings. When someone focuses on giving, the possibilities of a win/win outcome grow exponentially. When focusing on receiving, win/lose is sure to happen. Clients will lose, but on the long term, your brother will lose all clients, and harm definitely his reputation. That means that working for money, in addition to be a waste of time, causes a social damage and leads to poverty on the long term. On the other hand, working to help the others, making minor initial earnings is the natural right way of making long-term big earnings. The practical difference lies on the intention: to help himself or the others. It is not a philosophical approach, but an economical behavior. The "giving" approach seems also ecological, since it is just an imitation of the behavior of natural entities. The only way to make big money with permanent easy earnings is to cheat people and switch quickly to another type of business and habitats, repeating the process constantly, which is moreover the common approach of making big money (drug trafficking, pyramidal schemes, etc.). But usually this leads to heavy legal issues on the mid-term, and a possibly a big frustration, since the person cannot develop itself, but live fleeing formal and informal justice. 

Descartes gives the metaphysical implications of freedom of the will as it relates to the power of cognition. This involves the function of judgement in its natural character and representational function. How does this description deal with infinity and finitude as cognitive? Descartes seems to suggest that the concept of the cognitive is limited by their consideration. So, is the concept of cognition limited or enlarged by the concept of the infinite and finite? 

The historical notion of success derives from the desire for fame which was an eschatological response to the loss and replacement of transcendence or the divine ground as the ultimate orientation of the soul. In Plato’s book X of the Republic there is the Myth of Er which recounts the destiny and drama of the soul as an account of rewards and punishments in the afterlife. This Greek version of success gets extended and Christianized through Boethius’ The Consolation of Philosophy and Dante’s Divine Comedy. With the apex of Thomas Aquinas’ philosophical theology we reach the immortality of the soul turned into the beatific vision and friendship with God. In mid-fifteenth century, Poggio Bracciolini introduced fame as a symbol for the triumph of a world-immanent soul who seeks salvation through remembrance beyond one's historical epoch, not in the eternal civitas Dei. Eric Voegelin states: “The intramundane afterlife of fame is replacing the life beyond. Salvation by fame, however, is precarious, just as is salvation by Grace; many are called, but few are the elect. The orientation within the world requires no less a theology of fall and redemption than does the transcendental orientation” (Religion and the Rise of Modernity, in volume 23 of The Collected Works of Eric Voegelin, 139). This speculation enters under the impact of the Reformation and competitive society. “By the nineteenth century the biological formula of the survival of the fittest has replaced the Renaissance speculation on the fortuna secunda et adversa, and the survival of the fittest implies the plebian assumption that he who survives is the better man. Poggio is still aware of the tension between fate and value; he is sensitive to the tragedy of history; and there is something alive in him of the Polybian shudder in the face of victory. In the later adoration of success the two dimensions of action, victory and value, are made to coincide and the flow of action becomes untragically progressive; the plebian victor does not like to see the shadow of fortuna; he wants to be the victor by his merit” (ibid., 139-40). Success is transformed from other-worldly to the secular intramundane in modernity; this is one of the consequences of embracing human mortality and finitude. It also enhances the alienation and estrangement, along with Angst of modern selves because they look to subjective immortality through others who seek the same thing. That the historians will tell the people about their great deeds and achievements and this should give further satisfaction for those willing to follow or connected to them in some inspirational way. Praise for military, literary, or entertainment greatness culminates into living in the hearts and minds of future generations. But like Polybius we will “shudder” in the reality that the people will forget or that just as we conquer a people today, the same demise will visit our people someday. Therefore, I see success more to do with the “adventure” of one’s existence along the rhythms of victory and defeat, fame and shame. This adventure also applies to cultures and can be interpreted aesthetically, religiously, morally, and so on. Civilizational advancement would not be enough to be persuaded by the spirit of progress alone. It lies more in the effort and tenacity one is able to achieve through intensity and the accretion of value as stablized in sets of harmonies conducive to its environments. This includes the consideration and integration of exclusive or negative relations (prehensions) and the inhibitive nature of disharmonies, including their potential stagnation and destructiveness for the organic society or (non-) social nexus. As Whitehead writes at the end of Science and Modern World: “But in nature the normal way in which trees flourish is by their association in a forest. Each tree may lose something of its individual perfection of growth, but they mutually assist each other in preserving the conditions for survival. The soil is preserved and shaded; and the microbes necessary for its fertility are neither scorched, nor frozen, nor washed away. A forest is the triumph of the organisation of mutually dependent species. Further a species of microbes which kills the forest, also exterminates itself. Again the two sexes exhibit the same advantage of differentiation. In the history of the world, the prize has not gone to those species which specialised in methods of violence, or even in defensive armour. In fact, nature began with producing animals encased in hard shells for defence against the ills of life. It also experimented in size. But smaller animals, without external armour, warm-blooded, sensitive, and alert, have cleared these monsters off the face of the earth. Also, the lions and tigers are not the successful species. There is something in the ready use of force which defeats its own object. Its main defect is that it bars coöperation. Every organism requires an environment of friends, partly to shield it from violent changes, and partly to supply it with its wants....The Gospel of Force is incompatible with a social life. By force, I mean antagonism in its most general sense. Almost equally dangerous is the Gospel of Uniformity. The differences between the nations and races of mankind are required to preserve the conditions under which higher development is possible. One main factor in the upward trend of animal life has been the power of wandering. Perhaps this is why the armour-plated monsters fared badly. They could not wander. Animals wander into new conditions. They have to adapt themselves or die. Mankind has wandered from the trees to the plains, from the plains to the seacoast, from climate to climate, from continent to continent, and from habit of life to habit of life. When man ceases to wander, he will cease to ascend in the scale of being. Physical wandering is still important, but greater still is the power of man’s spiritual adventures—adventures of thought, adventures of passionate feeling, adventures of aesthetic experience. A diversification among human communities is essential for the provision of the incentive and material for the Odyssey of the human spirit. Other nations of different habits are not enemies: they are godsends. Men require of their neighbours something sufficiently akin to be understood, something sufficiently different to provoke attention, and something great enough to command admiration. We must not expect, however, all the virtues. We should even be satisfied if there is something odd enough to be interesting.” (New York: The Free Press, 1967, 206-07). 

Science is just some kind of knowledge (obtained with the scientific method). Other types of knowledge include religious knowledge (obtained from a book or tradition), family knowledge (obtained at home), etc. You are not forced to believe in science nor in any other type of knowledge. But some types of knowledge improve your survival probabilities. And not only that: they improve your quality of life. Following religious or other metaphysical types of knowledge, anything is possible if you have enough faith. That includes revival. So, if you take decisions based on religious knowledge, you risk killing your pet or yourself and not being able to come back to life again. Scientific knowledge is the one that seems the best one to increase the probabilities of survival and having a good life. It could be completely wrong, but it accepts improvements. So, if science says that the atom is made of smaller particles, and you use such knowledge, you have a great chance of success. Moreover, if you improve it following its methods, you have more chances of success. 

There are certainly no clear boundaries within science and philosophy. Science is about knowledge of nature, hypothesis, tests and repetition, and philosophy is about knowledge generated purely by reason, not objectively verifiable by the scientific method (hope providing a good approximation, if not, thanks in advance for any correction). How do we know whether a discipline is science or philosophy? For example, the systems theory seem to match both descriptions. 

This question is about a discipline, not about philosophy/science. There are clear differences between them, and the point is to assess whether a discipline can be considered to be mostly one or the other. 

Nietzsche consistently throughout his writings argues for a monological conception of art--art that does not seek "witnesses" or an audience. Not only did the episode with Wagner force Nietzsche to have "second thoughts" about art, but to "like anything at all after Wagner was a triumph." Cultural and social prejudices, phobias, and pressures pervert or stunt the aesthetic/creative processes according to Nietzsche--the genius should be truly for herself because the dominant authorities will sedate or even steal such energies, for their own purposes and, thereby, give a trifling notion of art's true value, which for Nietzsche lies in the very "transitions of life itself." Can art, especially today with the post-Hegelian "end of art" and Benjamin's "mechanical reproduction" theses, serve a thoroughly intimate function that leads a life of "courage without witnesses"? Can we say, for example, that rituals like fantasy-role playing or video games, which appear to be all about the artist as both creator and one's own work of art, are examples of what would qualify as monological art forms (and many other kinds), in Nietzsche's sense? 

In short, Hegel benefited from having his ideas more clearly worked out and regularly published which led to followings that became influential within continental philosophy. Hegel's authority has been a hallmark even for the enemies of his thought. And so it has become acceptable to ignore Schelling, but not Hegel. But as our historical reflective distance expands it is more evident that we cannot ignore either, especially the former. I take you to be inquiring into the dominant grand narratives of Western philosophy which take Hegel as a leading figure while Schelling is just lumped in with Fichte as the triad of German Idealism. Professional and popular culture philosophers alike have perpetuated this account. The beef between Schelling and Hegel is well-documented and given Hegel’s rising stature in taking over Berlin, many find Schelling’s later works as personal attacks of jealously. Schelling’s last public lectures on mythology and revelation are deemed largely as theosophy or “spiritual channeling” offering only religious or theological value. The conventional wisdom is impoverished and ignores Schelling’s own contributions in attempting to breakout of Hegel’s spell of logocentrism. There are several important differences between Schelling and Hegel that have been underappreciated. Given their connections, such as, being roommates in 1795 or editing a journal together, etc. a more serious problem persists involving the conflation of Schelling and Hegel. Zizek's reliance on Hegel's logic as the basis for his parallax ontology relies on a smuggled in reading of Schelling's later philosophy is a typical example of such misconstruing. Presupposed in his interpretation of Schelling's second draft of the Weltalter is the consistency between Schelling's attempts to overcome German Idealism with the mature Hegel's logic as the completion of the Idea for the transformation of positing substance as subject. You will not find this philosophical approach fruitful regardless of Zizek's aims at perversity and sleight-of-hand. Reading Schelling's philosophical journey as providing the ground for a materialist ontology or Marxist-oriented social critique is irresponsible rendering, in my estimation. This also involves the trouble with associating Schelling’s thought with the psychoanalysis of Freud or Lacan. Clearly, Schelling is credited as the first to develop a notion of unconsciousness in his philosophy but he dealt with it on a cosmically experiential level and not as some faculty human beings carry around in their heads. I applaud efforts at showing Schelling’s relevance to our world despite taking some of these approaches to be misleading. A Schellingian renaissance of sorts is taking place while much of Hegel’s authority has been challenged or eclipsed. Schelling moves us in the direction of contemporary philosophical sentiments which are pluralistic and, unlike Hegel, opposed to rooting history in Absolute Spirit with its apex in modern Christian Europe, but rather in a meta-drama of the fusion of “world-consciousness.” I see his thought as a springboard for American pragmatism and process philosophy and this is evident in the volume edited by Catherine Keller and Anne Daniell, entitled, Process and Difference: Between Cosmological and Poststructuralist Postmodernisms (2002). As Jerry Day notes in his book, Voegelin, Schelling, and the Philosophy of Historical Existence, (Columbia: University of Missouri Press, 2003, p. 143) “Schelling does not take the self-consciousness attained at the end of his reflections and project it back into the beginning of his discussion in order to found a system with self-consciousness as its ground. This step was, in Schelling’s estimation, the essential mistake of Fichte and Hegel.” Schelling’s superiority to Hegel comes out in several works, but probably the most decisive is in his philosophy of art completed way before Hegel’s which is undeniably a masterpiece and superior in style and historical surveying than Schelling’s (see Hegel’s Lectures on Aesthetics, 2 vols.). But that does not mean we can overlook the fact that Schelling does not provide some absolute perspective by which we can rank the philosopher against the artist, or the prophet contra the genius for all time. Rather, as David Simpson notes in the forward to Scott’s translation of Schelling’s philosophy of art lectures, “Schelling’s idea of the history of art is not founded upon a naïve progressivism of the sort that underlies Hegel’s alternative model (sophisticated as it is on its surface). It is in this sense closer to a secular, twentieth-century notion of history, according to which things are simply different at different times, without offering evidence of some totalizing pattern evolving with the passing of time” (Schelling, Philosophy of Art, trans. Douglas W. Scott, Minneapolis: University of Minnesota, 1989, p. xviii). Naturally, the concern arises why it has taken so long for postmodernists to recognize the fruits of Schelling’s projects or to question the superficial appropriations of such a paramount philosopher. You should be commended for asking such an important yet delicate question and I have a lot more to add on the subject in a forthcoming article on the power of negation.
