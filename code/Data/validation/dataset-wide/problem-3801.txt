Let $\gamma:[a,b]\longrightarrow\mathbb{C}$ be a closed continuous curve in the complex plane satisfies: $(1)\ \gamma(t)\neq 0,\ \forall t\in [a,b]$; $(2)\ \{\frac{\gamma(t)}{|\gamma(t)|}:t\in [a,b]\}=\{z\in \mathbb{C}:|z|=1\}$. For any given positive integer $n$, is that right that we can find $a\leq t_1<t_2\leq b$ such that $\gamma(t_1)^n=\gamma(t_2)^n?$ 

Let $n$ be a positive integer and $W_n$ be the linear subspace of the real vector space $\mathbb{R}[X_1,\cdots,X_n]$ generated by the following set $$S_n=\{X_1^{i_1}\cdots X_n^{i_n}:i_1+\cdots+i_n=n\ \text{and}\ i_k\in \{0,1,2\},k=1,\cdots,n\}.$$ Let $$T_n=\{(X_{i_1}-X_{i_2})(X_{i_2}-X_{i_3})\cdots(X_{i_n}-X_{i_1}):i_1,\cdots,i_n\ \text{is a permutation of}\ 1,\cdots,n\}.$$ It is easy to see that $T_n\subset W_n$. When $n$ is odd, the expansion of any polynomial in $T_n$ does not contain the monomial $X_1X_2\cdots X_n$. So $T_n$ can not generate $W_n$. When $n=2m\geq 8$ is even, we have $$|S_n|=\sum\limits_{k=0}^m\binom{n}{2k}\binom{2k}{k}< \dfrac{1}{2}(n-1)!=|T_n|.$$ So I want to ask can $W_n$ generated by $T_n$ when $n\geq 8$ is even? 

Given integers $m,n\geq 1$, let $W_{n,m}$ denote the family of all sequences $S_1,S_2,\cdots,S_m$ satisfying (1) every $S_i$ is a subset of $\{1,2,\cdots,n\}$; (2) $\mid S_i\cap S_j\mid\geq 3$ for all $1\leq i<j\leq m$. How to calculate $\mid W_{n,m}\mid$? Is there any known formula for $\mid W_{n,m}\mid$? Furthermore, if we denote $W_{n,m}^{+}$ to be the subset of $W_{n,m}$ as follow： $$W_{n,m}^{+}=\{(S_1,S_2,\cdots,S_m)\in W_{n,m}:\ \mid S_1\mid+\mid S_2\mid+\cdots\mid S_m\mid\equiv 0 \pmod{2}\}$$ How to calculate $\mid W_{n,m}^{+}\mid$? 

Let $n$ be a positive integer and $S_n$ be the symmetric group on $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$. Let $\mathcal{A}_n$ be the anti-symmetrization operator on $\mathbb{Z}[x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n]$ such that for any $f(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n)\in \mathbb{Z}[x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n]$, $$\mathcal{A}_n(f)=\sum_{w\in S_n}\varepsilon(w)f(x_{w(1)},x_{w(2)},\ldots,x_{w(n)}),$$ where $\varepsilon(w)=(-1)^{l(w)}$ is the sign of $w$. My question: For any integer $n>1$ with $n(n-1)\equiv 0 \pmod 4$, is it true that we can always choose $\displaystyle \frac{n(n-1)}{4}$ different polynomials $$x_{i_k}+x_{j_k},\ 1\leq k\leq \frac{n(n-1)}{4}$$ from the $\displaystyle \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ polynomials $$x_i+x_j,\ 1\leq i<j\leq n,$$ such that $$\mathcal{A}_n\left(\prod_{1\leq k\leq \frac{n(n-1)}{4}}(x_{i_k}+x_{j_k})^2\right)\neq0\ ?$$ For example, \begin{align*} n=4,\ \ &\mathcal{A}_4\left((x_1+x_2)^2(x_2+x_3)^2(x_3+x_4)^2\right)\neq0;\\ n=5,\ \ &\mathcal{A}_5\left((x_1+x_2)^2(x_2+x_3)^2(x_3+x_4)^2(x_4+x_5)^2(x_5+x_1)^2\right)\neq0. \end{align*} 

My research field is combinatorics. I am not very good at Algebra. So I want to ask for a given real multivariate polynomial $f(x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_n)$, is there any algebraic method to compute whether the following sum $$\sum_{(x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_n)\in \{0,1\}^n}f(x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_n)$$ is nonzero? 

Let $n$ be an even positive integer and $K_{2n}$ be the complete graph on $2n$ vertices. There are $\dfrac{1}{2}{{2n}\choose n}={{2n-1}\choose n}$ subgraphs of $K_{2n}$ which is isomorphic to $K_{n,n}$ and we use $E_1,E_2,\dots,E_{{2n-1}\choose n}$ to denote the edge sets of the ${2n-1}\choose n$ subgraphs respectively. My question is whether I can partition the edge set of $K_{2n}$ to $S_1,S_2,\dots,S_{2n-1}$ such that $|S_i|=n$ for every $1\leq i\leq2n-1$ and $\{\cup^{n}_{k=1}S_{i_k}:1\leq i_1<i_2<\dots<i_n\leq 2n-1\}=\{E_1,E_2,\dots,E_{{2n-1}\choose n}\}$? 

Let $a_{n,k}$ be the coefficient of $$X_1^{\frac{k(n-1)}{2}}X_2^{\frac{k(n-1)}{2}}\cdots X_n^{\frac{k(n-1)}{2}}$$ in the expansion of the real polynomial $$\left(\prod\limits_{1\leq i<j\leq n}(X_j-X_i)\right)^k,$$where $n,k$ are positive integers such that $n>1$ and $k(n-1)\equiv0 \pmod 2$. Since $$\prod\limits_{1\leq i<j\leq n}(X_j-X_i)=\sum\limits_{\sigma\in S_n}sgn(\sigma)\prod\limits_{i=1}^nX_{\sigma_i}^{i-1},$$ here the sum is computed over all permutations $\sigma$ of the set $\{1,2,\cdots,n\}$, we can get the following simple results: $(1)a_{n,1}=0$ for every odd positive integer $n>1$; $(2)a_{n,2}\neq 0$ for every positive integer $n>1$. I want to ask whether $a_{n,k}$ is equal to 0 or not when $k>2$. 

Let $S_n$ be the set of all the $n\times n\ (0,1)$-matrices and divide $S_n$ into two sets as follows: $A_n=\{M\in S_n:$ there exist a row and a column of $M$ such that the sum of the row is equal to the sum of the column$\}$ and $B_n=S_n\setminus A_n.$ I have two questions: $(1)$Is there any estimation for $\dfrac{|A_n|}{|S_n|}$ or $\dfrac{|B_n|}{|S_n|}?$ $(2)$I conjecture that $\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}\dfrac{|A_n|}{|S_n|}=1,$ is that right? 

Suppose the following real polynomial of $n$ variables $$f(X_1,X_2,\cdots,X_n)=\sum_{I=(i_1,i_2,\cdots,i_n)}a_IX_1^{i_1}X_2^{i_2}\cdots X_n^{i_n}$$ is easy or familiar to us, but I need to deal with the following real polynomial: $$F(X_1,X_2,\cdots,X_n)=\sum_{I=(i_1,i_2,\cdots,i_n)}sign(a_I)a_I^2X_1^{i_1}X_2^{i_2}\cdots X_n^{i_n},$$ where $\begin{eqnarray}sign(a_I)= \begin{cases} 1,&a_I>0\cr 0, &a_I=0 \cr -1, &a_I<0\end{cases} \end{eqnarray}.$ I want to ask if there is any method or skill to associate $F(X_1,X_2,\cdots,X_n)$ with $f(X_1,X_2,\cdots,X_n)$? 

Let $f:[a,b]\longrightarrow\mathbb{R}^2$ be an injective continuous function. For any $d>0$, does there exist a piecewise linear curve: $g:[a,b]\longrightarrow\mathbb{R}^2$ such that $g$ is also injective and $$|g(t)-f(t)|<d,\ \forall t\in [a,b].$$ 

Let $n$ be any given positive integer. For any nonempty disjoint subset $A,B\subseteq \{1,2,\cdots ,n\}$，does there exist some specific matrix $M$ which is similar to the Vandermonde matrix such that $$\begin{vmatrix} M \end{vmatrix}=\prod\limits_{i\in A,j\in B}(x_j-x_i)$$ $$\text{or}$$$$\begin{vmatrix} M \end{vmatrix}\neq 0 \quad\text{if and only if}\prod\limits_{i\in A,j\in B}(x_j-x_i)\neq 0\quad?$$ 

Some basic definitions about reduced decomposition: In the symmetric group $S_n$, let $s_i$ denote the adjacent transposition $(i,i+1),i\in \{1,2,\cdots,n-1\}.$ Since $S_n$ is generated by adjacent transpositions, any permutation $w\in S_n$ can be written as $w=s_{i_1}s_{i_2}\cdots s_{i_l}$ and an expression $w=s_{i_1}s_{i_2}\cdots s_{i_l}$ of minimal possible length $l$ is called a reduced decomposition, $l=\ell(w)$ is the length of $w$. In fact, $\ell(w)=\#\{(i,j):1\leq i<j\leq n\ \text{and}\ w(i)>w(j)\}$. So $w_0$, given by $w(i)=n+1-i$, is the longest element in $S_n$ whose length is $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$. For any $1\leq i<j\leq n$, let $t_{ij}$ be the transposition that interchanges $i$ and $j$. My question is how to find all the following decompositions: $$w_0=t_{i_1j_1}t_{i_2j_2}\cdots t_{i_mj_m}$$ such that $\ell(t_{i_1j_1}\cdots t_{i_kj_k})=k,\ k=1,2,\cdots,m$. Is there any method or function to characterize such decompositions? 

Let $R,\Omega$ be two integral domains such that $R$ is Noetherian and $\Omega=R[\alpha]$ for some $\alpha\in \Omega$. If there are infinite prime elements in $R$, can we proof that there are infinite prime elements in $\Omega$ too ? 

Problem Given any positive integer $n$, what is the maximum number of edges in an even-cycle-free graph with $n$ vertices? Is the above problem an unsolved problem in extremal graph theory? Are there any results about this problem? 

Dyson's Theorem The constant term in the expansion of $$\prod_{1\leq i\neq j\leq n}\left(1-\frac{x_i}{x_j}\right)^{a_i}$$ is the multinomial coefficient $$\frac{(a_1+\cdots+a_n)!}{a_1!\cdots a_n!},$$ where $a_1,\cdots,a_n$ are nonnegative integers. My question is for general $$F(x_1,\cdots,x_n)=\prod_{1\leq i\neq j\leq n}\left(1-\frac{x_i}{x_j}\right)^{a_{ij}}$$ where $a_{ij}$ are nonnegative integers, are there any results or theories about when the constant term in the expansion of $F(x_1,\cdots,x_n)$ is nonzero? 

From the Hilbert's Nullstellensatz, we know that for any algebraic closed field $K$ and any prime ideal $p$ of $K[X_1,X_2,\cdots,X_n]$, the intersection of all the maximal ideals containing $p$ is $p$. Does this conclusion still hold for a general field $K$? 

Given $\theta\in [0,2\pi)$ and let $a,b$ be two nonnegative integers. Consider the following integral: $$I=\int_0^{\pi}\sin^{2a+1}x\sin^{2b+1}(x+\theta)dx.$$ Since $$\int_0^{\pi}\sin^mx\cos^{2n+1}xdx=0$$ for all nonnegative integers $m,n$, we have \begin{eqnarray*} &&\int_0^{\pi}\sin^{2a+1}x\sin^{2b+1}(x+\theta)dx\\ &=&\int_0^{\pi}\sin^{2a+1}x(\sin x\cos\theta+\cos x\sin\theta)^{2b+1}dx\\ &=&\sum_{k=0}^b\left(\binom{2b+1}{2k+1}\int_0^{\pi}\sin^{2b-2k}\theta\sin^{2a+2k+2}x\cos^{2b-2k}xdx\right)(\cos\theta)^{2k+1}. \end{eqnarray*} Then the sign of $I$ is equal to the sign of $\cos\theta$. Is there any more direct or more simple way to see this? 

Let $G=(V,E)$ be a graph and $V=A\cup B$ satisfying $(1)A\cap B=\emptyset;$ $(2)|N_G(v)\cap B|\geq |N_G(v)\cap A|,\forall v\in A$ and $|N_G(v)\cap A|\geq |N_G(v)\cap B|,\forall v\in B$. Let $S=\{(u,v)|u\in A,v\in B,N_G(u)\cap N_G(v)\neq \emptyset\}$ and $G[A],G[B]$ be the induced subgraphs of $G$ by $A$ and $B$ respectively. I conjecture that $|S|\geq |E(G[A])|+|E(G[B])|$, is that right? 

For any given integers $m,n\geq1$, let $\mathbb{R}[x_1,\cdots,x_n]_m$ be the vector space of homogeneous polynomials of degree $m$ in $x_1,\cdots,x_n$ over the field of real numbers $\mathbb{R}$. Denote by $\mathbb{N}^n_m$ the following set $$\mathbb{N}^n_m=\{(a_1,\cdots,a_n)\in \mathbb{Z}^n:a_1,\cdots,a_n\geq0,\ a_1+\cdots+a_n=m\}.$$ For any $a=(a_1,\cdots,a_n)\in \mathbb{N}^n_m$, denote by $x^a$ the monomial $$x^a=x_1^{a_1}\cdots x_n^{a_n}.$$ It is clear that $x^a$ with $a\in \mathbb{N}^n_m$ form a basis of the vector space $\mathbb{R}[x_1,\cdots,x_n]_m$. Define an inner product $\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle$ on $\mathbb{R}[x_1,\cdots,x_n]_m$ such that for any $a=(a_1,\cdots,a_n),b=(b_1,\cdots,b_n)\in \mathbb{N}^n_m$, $$\langle x^a,x^b\rangle=\left\{ \begin{aligned} &0& a\neq b\\ &a_1!\cdots a_n!\ \ & a=b \end{aligned} \right.$$ For any $f(x_1,\cdots,x_n),g(x_1,\cdots,x_n)\in \mathbb{R}[x_1,\cdots,x_n]_m$, a general expression of $\langle f,g\rangle$ I can think out is as follow: $$\langle f,g\rangle=\int_0^{\infty}\cdots\int_0^{\infty}\int_0^{2\pi}\cdots\int_0^{2\pi}e^{-(x_1+\cdots+x_n)} f(\frac{x_1}{e^{i\theta_1}},\cdots,\frac{x_n}{e^{i\theta_n}})g(e^{i\theta_1},\cdots,e^{i\theta_n})dx_1\cdots dx_nd\theta_1\cdots d\theta_n.$$ Is there any better integral expression of $\langle f,g\rangle$ not using complex integration, or is there any general expression of $\langle f,g\rangle$ not only confined to integral expression? Any idea is welcome! 

Let $\mathbb{R}$ be the real field. For any homogeneous polynomial $f(X_1,\cdots,X_n)$ in $\mathbb{R}[X_1,\cdots,X_n]$, we use $S_f(X_1,\cdots,X_n)$ to denote the following homogeneous symmetric polynomial: $$S_f(X_1,\cdots,X_n)=\sum_{\sigma=[i_1,\cdots,i_n]\in S_n}f(X_{i_1},\cdots,X_{i_n}).$$ Here the sum is computed over all permutations $\sigma=[i_1,\cdots,i_n](\sigma(1)=i_1,\cdots,\sigma(n)=i_n)$ of the set $\{1,\cdots,n\}$ and the set of all such permutations is denoted $S_n.$ We say $f(X_1,\cdots,X_n)$ is good if $$S_f(a_1,\cdots,a_n)\geq 0$$ for every $(a_1,\cdots,a_n)\in \mathbb{R}^n.$ For example, when $n=3$, we have $$f(X_1,X_2,X_3)=X_3^2-X_1X_2$$ is good because$$S_f(X_1,X_2,X_3)=(X_1-X_2)^2+(X_2-X_3)^2+(X_3-X_1)^2.$$ For any $n\geq 1$, define the homogeneous polynomial of degree $n^2$ in $\mathbb{R}[X_1,X_2,\cdots,X_{2n}]$ as follow:$$\varphi_n(X_1,X_2,\cdots,X_{2n})=\prod_{\substack{1\leq i\leq n\\n+1\leq j\leq 2n}}(X_i-X_j).$$ I conjecture that $\varphi_n$ is good for any $n\geq 1$, and for this conjecture I have got the following simple results: $(1)$It is easy to proof that $S_{\varphi_n}(X_1,X_2,\cdots,X_{2n})=0$ when $n$ is odd; $(2)$When $n$ is even,$$S_{\varphi_2}(X_1,X_2,X_3,X_4)=4[((X_1-X_2)(X_3-X_4))^2+((X_1-X_3)(X_2-X_4))^2+((X_1-X_4)(X_2-X_3))^2].$$ So the conjecture is right for $n=2$. I can not proof it any more for $n\geq 4$, but I believe that the conjecture is right. Would you please give me some help? 

Let the real polynomial $$f_{a,b,c}(x_1,x_2,x_3)=(x_1-x_2)^{2a+1}(x_2-x_3)^{2b+1}(x_3-x_1)^{2c+1},$$ where $a,b,c$ are nonnegative integers. Let $m_{a,b,c}$ be the coefficient of the monomial $x_1^{a+c+1}x_2^{a+b+1}x_3^{b+c+1}$ in the expansion of $f_{a,b,c}(x_1,x_2,x_3)$. It is easy to see $m_{a,b,c}=0$ when two of $a,b,c$ are equal. I want to ask whether $m_{a,b,c}=0$ or not when $a,b,c$ are pairwise unequal. 

Let $\mathcal{G}_{n,\frac{1}{2}}$ be the probability space of $n\times n$ matrices over $\{0,1\}$ and each entry of the matrix is independently equal to 1 with probability $\frac{1}{2}$ and equal to 0 otherwise. Define a real-valued random variable $X$: $$X(M)=\prod\limits_{1\leq i,j\leq n}(\sum\limits_{k=1}^na_{ik}-\sum\limits_{k=1}^na_{kj}),\ M=(a_{ij})\in \mathcal{G}_{n,\frac{1}{2}}.$$ It is easy to see that $E(X)=0$ when $n$ is odd. I am interested in the case when $n$ is even. I computed up to $n=2,4,6$ roughly and observed that for most $M$ with no row sum equal to a column sum, $X(M)>0.$ So I guess $E(X)>0$ when $n$ is even, is that right? 

A graph is a minimal graph of diameter $2$ if it has diameter $2$ and the deletion of any edge increases its diameter. Let $G$ be a minimal graph of diameter $2$, then every edge of $G$ belongs to a path $u$-$v$ in $G$ which is the unique path of length at most $2$ with endpoints $u$ and $v$. My question is: If $H$ is a graph satisfies every edge of $H$ belongs to a path $u$-$v$ in $H$ which is the unique path of length at most $2$ with endpoints $u$ and $v$. Does there must exist a minimal graph $G$ of diameter $2$ such that $V(G)=V(H)$ and $H$ is a subgraph of $G$? 

Let $n$ be a given even positive integer. We have the following integral \begin{eqnarray} &&\int_0^1\cdots\int_0^1\prod\limits_{i=1}^n\prod\limits_{j=1}^n(x_i-y_j)dx_1\cdots dx_ndy_1\cdots dy_n\\ &=&\int_0^1\cdots\int_0^1\left(\int_0^1\prod\limits_{j=1}^n(x-y_j)dx\right)^ndy_1\cdots dy_n\\ &>&0. \end{eqnarray} Let's consider a similar integral where $n$ is also an even positive integer: $$A_n=\int_0^1\cdots\int_0^1\int_0^{2\pi}\cdots\int_0^{2\pi}\prod\limits_{i=1}^n\prod\limits_{j=1}^n\left(x_i-y_j+i\cos(\alpha_i-\beta_j)\right)dx_1\cdots dx_ndy_1\cdots dy_nd\alpha_1\cdots d\alpha_nd\beta_1\cdots d\beta_n.$$ It is easy to see that $A_n$ is a real number for every $n$. My question is whether $A_n$ is positive or not. 

Let $T_n$ be the class of $(0,1)$-matrices of order n with no row sum equal to a column sum. Is there any name or research about this kind of matrix? For any $A\in T_n$, let $S_A$ be the sum of all the entries of $A$. I found when $n$ is even, for most $A\in T_n$,$S_A$ is even, but I do not know how to describe it exactly. So I ask for some help! 

Let $f:[0,1]\longrightarrow\mathbb{R}^2$ be a continuous function such that $f(1)-f(0)=(1,0).$ Is it right that we can find $0\leq t_1<t_2\leq1$ such that $f(t_2)-f(t_1)=(\pm1,0)$ and for any $t_1\leq t<t'< t_2$ or $t_1< t<t'\leq t_2$, $f(t')-f(t)=(a,0)$ for some $a\in \mathbb{R}$ gives $|a|<1$? 

Some main definitions and basic facts of divided differences: In the symmetric group $S_n$, let $s_i$ denote the adjacent transposition $(i,i+1),i\in \{1,2,\cdots,n-1\}.$ Since $S_n$ is generated by adjacent transpositions, any permutation $w\in S_n$ can be written as $w=s_{i_1}s_{i_2}\cdots s_{i_l}$ and an expression $w=s_{i_1}s_{i_2}\cdots s_{i_l}$ of minimal possible length $l$ is called a reduced decomposition, $l=\ell(w)$ is the length of $w$. In fact, $\ell(w)=\#\{(i,j):1\leq i<j\leq n\ \text{and}\ w(i)>w(j)\}$. So $w_0$, given by $w(i)=n+1-i$, is the longest element in $S_n$ whose length is $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$. Let $f=f(x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_n)$ be a polynomial in $\mathbb{Z}[x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_n]$. For $w\in S_n$, denote $w(f)=f(x_{w^{-1}(1)},x_{w^{-1}(2)},\cdots,x_{w^{-1}(n)})$. The divided difference operator $\partial_i$ is then defined by $$\partial_if=\frac{s_if-f}{x_{i+1}-x_i}.$$ For any permutation $w\in S_n$, define the operator $\partial_w$ by $$\partial_w=\partial_{i_1}\partial_{i_2}\cdots \partial_{i_l},$$ where $w=s_{i_1}s_{i_2}\cdots s_{i_l}$ is a reduced decomposition and $\partial_w$ does not depend on the choice of such reduced decomposition. Proposition 1. For any polynomial $f$, $$\partial_{w_0}(f)=\left(\sum\limits_{w\in S_n}(-1)^{\ell(w)}w(f)\right)\cdot\prod\limits_{1\leq i<j\leq n}(x_i-x_j)^{-1}.$$ 2. Let $f=\sum\limits_{i=1}^na_ix_i$ be a polynomial of degree one, then for any permutation $w$ and polynomial $g$, we have $$\partial_w(fg)=w(f)\partial_w(g)+\sum\limits_{1\leq i<j\leq n}(a_i-a_j)\partial_{wt_{ij}}(g),$$ where the sum is over all $1\leq i<j\leq n$ such that $\ell(wt_{ij})=\ell(w)-1$ and $t_{ij}$ is the permutation that interchanges $i$ and $j$. Note: The content above are all come from this article. For any $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\times n$ matrix $A=(a_{ij})$ with entries from $\mathbb{Z}$, let $f_A$ be the following polynomial $$f_A(x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_n)=\prod\limits_{i=1}^{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}(a_{i1}x_1+a_{i2}x_2+\cdots+a_{in}x_n),$$ then we can get the following corollary which follows from the above proposition. For simplicity, $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ hereinafter is denoted by $m$. Corollary For any matrix $A=(a_{ij})\in M_{m\times n}(\mathbb{Z})$, $$\partial_{w_0}(f_A)=\sum(a_{1i_1}-a_{1j_1})(a_{2i_2}-a_{2j_2})\cdots(a_{mi_m}-a_{mj_m}),$$ where the sum is over all $1\leq i_1<j_1\leq n,1\leq i_2<j_2\leq n,\cdots,1\leq i_m<j_m\leq n$ such that $t_{i_1j_1},t_{i_2j_2},\cdots,t_{i_mj_m}$ satisfy $\ell(t_{i_1j_1}\cdots t_{i_kj_k})=k,\ k=1,2,\cdots,m$. For simplicity, the subscript of the sum above hereinafter is denoted by $T_n$. Define a operator $$\begin{align} \alpha:M_{m\times n}(\mathbb{Z})&\longrightarrow \mathbb{Z},\\ A=(a_{ij})&\mapsto \partial_{w_0}(f_A)=\sum\limits_{T_n}(a_{1i_1}-a_{1j_1})(a_{2i_2}-a_{2j_2})\cdots(a_{mi_m}-a_{mj_m}), \end{align}$$ then $\partial_{w_0}(f_A)=\alpha(A)$ and I can get some properties of the operator $\alpha$ as follows. 1. $\alpha(cA)=c^m\alpha(A)$, $\forall c\in \mathbb{Z}$ and $A\in M_{m\times n}(\mathbb{Z})$. 2. Viewing an matrix in $M_{m\times n}(\mathbb{Z})$ as being composed of $m$ rows, $\alpha$ is an $m$-linear function. 3. Interchanging any pair of rows of $A$ does not change $\alpha(A)$, $\forall A\in M_{m\times n}(\mathbb{Z})$. 4 Interchanging any pair of columns of $A$ multiplies $\alpha(A)$ by −1, $\forall A\in M_{m\times n}(\mathbb{Z})$. Therefore, if two columns of $A$ are identical, $\alpha(A)=0$. I have two questions as follows. Question 1. The properties $1,2$ above can easily follow from the definition of the operator $\alpha$ and I got the properties $3,4$ by using the equality $\partial_{w_0}(f_A)=\alpha(A)$ and the property of $\partial_{w_0}$. Take the property $4$ for example, for any $1\leq i<j\leq n$ and $A\in M_{m\times n}(\mathbb{Z})$, let $A'$ be the matrix obtained from $A$ by interchanging the $i$th and $j$th columns of $A$, then we have $$\alpha(A)+\alpha(A')=\partial_{w_0}(f_A)+\partial_{w_0}(t_{ij}(f_A))=\partial_{w_0}(f_A+t_{ij}f_A)=0.$$ My first question is how to get the properties $3,4$ by using the definition of $\alpha$. 2. When $\alpha(A)\neq 0$? What I am asking for is a sufficient condition or necessary and sufficient condition of $A\in M_{m\times n}(\mathbb{Z)}$ that $\alpha(A)\neq 0$.
