What is the local norm for the job you are taking What are the specific points taht you could lever on to get your own value over the norm(or under, if you've got weaknesses) Is the prospective employee in a hurry? Does he have other candidates ready? How good did you seduce? 

In normal times, no, it is not a mistake to say vaguely that you've got contacts. The rationale behind this is to let the interviewer know you are a merchandise of value, as other firms are interested. There can be exceptions, but it does not seem the case. It can be a mistake to be too specific though, but only for the final negociation part. If Bank B knows that Bank A offered you 29, then either they know you are too costly for you, or they're not going above 30. But that's all. Million of things can happen & slow down a recruiting process. Holidays, disease, unforecasted meetings or events, last-minute new candidate that seems fit, etc... Those things are not your problem. As a candidate, the thing to do is to go on prospecting, and having interviews. For 2 main reasons. First, you never know if the previous interviews will lead to something. The job opening can be cancelled, the recruiter fired, the son of the CEO may want the place, the HR may find your cost excessive, etc... As long as you don't have a signed contract in hand, you shall search actively to minimize the risk of failure. Second reason is the great secret : passing interviews is a skill. You shall train it as much as possible. The more interviews you have, the easier the next ones will be. Even if you stay all your career in the same firm(like the state, the army, or a very big bank), you're going to have interviews for new positions. Whatever path your career is taking, your opportunities for training that skill are going to be low, and its importance is going to be high. Maybe 3 weeks after the forecasted date, they're going to call you back. Maybe not. It's not in your control. Keep focused on what is in your control, it's not even important, and keep searching. 

They know that they want you, so that will taint all of the remaining interviews with an attitude of "this is just a formality that we have to do, even though we've already made up our minds". The director is (apparently) in your corner, so if someone were to suggest that they like someone else who interviews after you, he will probably swing them back to you. Interviewing sucks. 

It's been my experience that most companies (that I've worked for) don't really give too much thought to UX/UI and all that in entails. As long as the program works they don't really care how it looks or how the user's interaction with it is. It's also been my experience that just because someone wants to do something or thinks they can do something doesn't necessarily mean that they can actually do that thing, especially when it comes to something that requires a bit of talent for that thing. UX/UI design is kind of like art - anyone can paint a painting, but not everyone can paint a painting that someone would actually want to hang on their wall. It could be that, even though you have done acceptable UI work in the past, your boss just doesn't think that your UI work is up to par with someone who should be doing it full time. If you think that your work is good enough and it really is, you may just want to find a job with a title and responsibilities that align with what you really want to be doing. The problem is that it doesn't seem like you have too much to show potential employers when going out for UI jobs. For positions like that you more or less need a portfolio to show. So build your portfolio and go job hunting... your boss has already made up his mind about you and UI. 

It is very common for graphists to have that kind of elements in their portfolio. It is commonly thought to be a bad idea for a programmer to include them, at the same time. tradition, habits..... My understanding is that most potential employers want "serious" programmers, and are looking for corporate looking candidates. Another reason is automation. Many recruiters are lazy, and it's easier to automate the parsing of a Word CV than a nice graphical thing. That's the two reasons why noone does it. Though in your specific case, it might be worth looking for a middle ground : a standard CV with nothing graphical for the HR robots to be happy, but with a link to your best graphics. A more efficient HR person would have a look, and be impressed. 

It depends where you live. French example. If you live in Saint-Maurice, it's an asset. If you live in Bobigny, it's a liability. The demographics of both towns is vastly different, and, unfortunately, prejudice is strong in our country(like probably everywhere else). Prejudiced in favor of Saint-Maurice's demographics, against Bobigny's one. From what I understand, you live in your local equivalent of Bobigny. That's why J J's answer applies fully. 

I'm going to answer with another question : what story are you telling them? You are trying to get a job. You need to be convincing. What is your strategy to be convincing? What story of your career up to now are you going to unfold during the interview? Does this try 5 years ago enter the story? If it's "We match much better than a few years ago, and here is why.....", then it can be part of your storytelling. Short of that kind of storytelling, there is no reason to remind them there was a miss a few years ago. It's a risk to take only if it shows a clearly added value to your story. EDIT : changed after comment. 

We all suffer from Imposter Syndrome from time to time because of a mistake that we have done or a lack of specific knowledge that we might have. It's not unusual to make mistakes and mistakes can be good. If you learn from them and do better next time, a mistake can be worth the initial embarrassment. I wouldn't worry about the confidence of your teammates. This one thing won't color their whole opinion of you. It might actually work in your favor. They could think "Hey, he's not perfect either!" and possibly think better of you. Because I'm sure that everyone else on your team has made mistakes too. And they won't hold it against you because I'm sure they wouldn't want you to hold their mistakes against them. I have the same experience as you and I make mistakes all the time. I've also been around even more senior people than you and I and know of tons of mistakes they have made - everyone does it once in a while! 

I wouldn't ask HR anything, they will tell you if you have passed all the required checks once you have passed them. Background checks in particular can take quite a long time depending on what they're checking into and how thorough they are and how many questions they may have to ask you about things they can't verify. Be patient, they WILL let you know. And I wouldn't think about giving notice until I get the "all clear". 

Your manager is right. If scrum done "as it should be" does not fit your employees office culture, then you shall not do scrum "as it should be", but adapt the way it is done. Scrum is supposed to be an agile method, which means you adapt the process to the context, not the reverse. People are part of the context. They seem not to fit culturally with that meeting, as it is set up. Therefore, that meeting has to be changed. 

You are not a robot. You are a human being, and you have your own rythm. An important thing is to know yourself. How long are you efficient? What is the most efficient method to get quickly back to a productive status? I know I cannot make long days. Usually, when I finish a complex coding(or testing, I've got both roles), I'm going to toilets. Even if I don't need. It's a cut in my effort. Others go smoking, or drink a coffee, or lose 10 minutes on workplace stack, or whatever. You need pauses. Find the proper way for you doing pauses, and your productivity is going to skyrocket. 

AndreiROM's answer is excellent and to the point, but I'd like to give you another perspective : if you are programming GUI, and if your users have far worse screens than you have(not unlikely, unfortunately), then your screens are already a danger for being too nice. Our GUI developpers have very big screens, the best money can buy. Some of our customers often have 10-years old crappy machines, with 13" screens, 15" when they are lucky. And they suffer from having scrollbars everywhere on their screens, which makes some of important features very tough to use. When the developper does not feel the pain of the end-user, he might program it happily, without realizing he's doing bad. So it's a trade-off. Of course better stuff(not only screens, whatever) allows for better productivity. But if it makes you think that everythng is nice, while the result on end-users's machines will be catastrophic, then it's useless to be more productive. 

This depends on the workplace. As Chris mentioned, asking about average vacation is a good idea. Maybe as you talk to the team, ask what their last vacation was to give you an idea of how your future coworkers view their vacation time. 

Chris has a very good answer, but I would like to add my experence as working somewhere that made the transition from a traditional vacation policy to an unlimited one. Many people working through this transition had many of the same doubts you did. 

You didn't ask this, but it is implied. Many times people in traditional companies may try to burn up their vacation. Like my dad taking off every Friday for 2 months. Many people may bank up vacation to use around the birth of a child, or use it around when they are resigning. My experience is that this doesn't work this way. There is no days to "burn" so there would be no reason for the company to compensate someone leaving/being laid off with unused vacation days. Don't think that there will be a magical number of days you are entitled to. 

You probably won't find fine print with a number of days specified. Your contract will probably say something like "If you plan on being gone for more than 2-3 days you will need manager approval." This should be no different than traditional. Basically you have to get your manager to let you go. For people with bad management this means that "unlimited" becomes no vacation. If you have a reasonable manager, they should let you take a reasonable amount of vacation. If you ask for a month off every quarter, expect them to say no. Guidance at my last company was that people should be taking 4-5 weeks. 

If you meet all the requirements in the description for a "Senior X" job, then you should consider yourself a "Senior X" for that particular job. Job titles really don't mean that much, but if a job descriptions says "looking for a Senior X with 7 years of experience and knowledge of X, X, and X" and you meet that criteria then you can consider yourself a "Senior X" for the purpose of applying for that job because that is what they consider a "Senior X" to be. Another job may consider "Senior" to have 5 years and so-and-so education... it all depends on the job. 

Unless you think that the new changes to the resume would really improve your chances of landing the job, I would just take the version that you submitted to get the interview. That version was good enough to get you the interview and they've already studied it and may have developed some questions based on it. Throwing a whole new version at them when you sit down for the interview may not make them happy or it could throw them off - or they could just ignore it. Better to not take a chance. That being said, if your new one has some extra stuff on it that you feel could be of use then bring one of those as well as the old one. If it comes down to "hey, we like you but you just don't seem to have enough experience with X", and you have that experience on your new resume then you could bring that out and point out that you do have that experience and you have updated your resume to reflect that. 

In the context that the review was good I would view these comments as "things that can always be improved." I came from a dancing background, and in dance no matter how good you are, there are things to do better. A dancer can always try to kick higher, jump higher, spin faster, etc. Your boss may have this kind of "always can be improved" mindset, so you were in essence told 

For somewhat work related items, I have seen people put the stuff on a table with a sign that read something like "Free to a good home." These are things like programming books etc. that they do not need anymore. However, work is not a thrift store, and I think it would be frowned upon to bring in home goods in that way. Instead find a nice place to donate it around you or a website that specializes it peer to peer local items. Keep your work life professional. 

As keshlam said, don't panic and don't quit. The worst they can do is fire you and at least you will be paid for as long as possible and learn. But if you set reasonable expectations you might be pleasantly surprised. 

Since this was a positive review, I don't see any harm in waiting for the regular meeting. Go ahead and ask for clarification on these points, and seek out the additional resources they mentioned. They may not have any specifics in mind for how to improve in an area, other than "stretch more" so it might be important to just listen to how they view the feedback you got. Since this is their first time giving reviews, they may not have wanted to give a "this person is a complete rock star with no flaws" review or may have been instructed to try to find areas where each person could improve.
