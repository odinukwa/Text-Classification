I do not know how Prabhavananda supports his thesis "Hindu thought exercises a strong influence upon the minds of early Western thinkers." What are his arguments and examples? The first known contact between India and Greek in the domain of religious thinking and philosophical speculation are known from the Hellenistic period, after Alexander's conquering expeditions. Namely, the questions of the Indo-Greek king Menandros (Milinda) to the Buddhist monk Nagasena and Nagasenas answers. But the text is handed down much later. Hence we do not know about any Buddhist influence on the Ionian philosophers of nature, neither on Plato or Aristotle. Even less we know about influences of Hinduism on Greek philosophers of this time - your original question. 

Wittgenstein does not give a definition of the term fact. But one can try to derive the meaning of the different terms: Proposition 1.1 states that the basic entities in his ontology are not single things but relations between things, which he calls facts. Considered this way, Wittgenstein takes thing as an undefined basic notion and uses it to define the term fact. If one calls a possible relation a circumstance (= Sachverhalt, in German), then a fact is a real circumstance (= Tatsache, in German). Hence the real world is singled out from all possible worlds by those circumstances which are facts. 

I think this is a strict programming scenario where "True" is treated as a variable, and not in any philosophical way. For example in VBA "True" is equivalent to -1, while False is equivalent to 0. Other programming languages define "True" as 1. If that is the case with Python, it follows that 1 + 1 > 1. In Philosophy, True + True = True because Truth is not a divisible value. 

I believe that the phrase explains that beauty in aesthetics is an a priori knowledge that is simultaneously the highest positive value and personification of truth. Aesthetics is an experiential phenomena that is external to ourselves and, ostensibly, is an appreciation for the truth of beauty (which is perceived as a universal concept in the author's theory). It is not related to one's person satisfaction, but an a priori truth and value accessed through this appreciation. Therefore, it is intrinsically "unselfed". 

Since this is a modern trend being widely implemented, it is a suitable answer - and the end to many people's investigations. It was my experience that strictly studying business as a practical subject was limited to strictly finding a solution to a problem and never discussing the deeper implications of those decisions. However, in studying philosophy I delved into other facets of the questions; i.e. "If outsourcing will eventually raise the cost of labor in a country, is this a sustainable practice?", "Is exporting labor exploitive?", and "What role does a business play in the community that sustains it?". Many of these questions fell outside of the scope of a business study, but integrally informative in practical business. 

Your question operates on two different levels: On one hand you describe how people search natural explanations in daily life. On the other hand, you ask on a theoretical level 

It is necessary to discriminate between that what induces, motivates, or visualizes an idea and the idea itself. Accordingly I agree with you that physics and even daily experience prompt us to form the idea of a natural number. We formalize this idea, i.e. the concept of natural numbers, by Peano axioms. By this step we have left the realm of physics and entered into the realm of mathematics. In the realm of mathematics we now make new definitions and prove statements about natural numbers, e.g., propositions about prime numbers. The whole path from natural numbers to integers, rationals, reals, complex numbers, quaterions etc. is a path with in the realm of mathematics. But the motivation do lay out such a path is often triggered by physical needs and insights. Hence I do not see a dilemma between mathematics and physics. They are two separate domains, each which its own set of rules. The rules of mathematics are independent from the rules of physics. One has to be always aware whether one stays momentarily in the physical or in the mathematics domain. 

To Heidegger, "Being" is neither of your two examples, because they relate to something outside of what it is intrinsically in it-self. However, a hindu Brahman is "Being", when they are practicing their beliefs and striving towards joining Brahma. Just as a Carpenter is "Being", when he is doing carpentry. Unlike your two examples - where the actors are striving to join a unity of being or ultimate entity - it is not "to what ends" that concerns Heidegger, it is "acting in accordance to the self" that is important. 

I would propose that there are several logical failings in your counter argument. Premise contradiction 

Patterns and symmetry are abound in Nature, but a sense of numerals isn't inherent. The numerals are a construct, a human method of expressing those patterns and to create grouping. The universality of math as "the language of nature" has more to do with a need to quantify nature to create models for deeper understand. These numbers are representations of repeated experiences, not necessarily inherent qualities of a specific item or of Nature as a whole. A good example of this is the calendar. There are many different calendars throughout human history. Our current gregorian calendar was even modified to include two extra months in recognition of Julius Caesar and Augustus Caesar (July and August respectively). This is why September, October, November and December (each representing a numeral - 7, 8, 9, 10 - are actually the 9th, 10th, 11th and 12th months). Additionally every 4 year we have a leap year, because the orbit of the earth around the sun actually takes approximately 365 1/4 days. Both of these examples help to demonstrate how we use number to create representations of natural events. But those events, while perhaps regular and relatively dependable, do not necessarily perfectly align numerically. Variation is seen all throughout Nature. 

Hobbes seems a bit unprecise. In the first part of his statement he equalizes imagination with memory, while in the second he correctly separates both as two aspects of the same object. Nevertheless one can understand what he means. 

1) I am not sure that the notion social reductionism is defined as in your post. But let's assume it for the sake of the argument. Then social reductionism is wrong. A philosopher of science only needs to apply the historical method: Changes in science like the invention of Quantum Theory or the Special Theory of Relativity in the begining of the beginning of the 20th century cannot be explained in terms or approaches from sociology or politics. Both theories do not bear any relation to politics. Of course Quantum Mechanics has been invented in a stimulating academic context. Here sociology comes into play, but not as a main actor. On the other hand, the Special Theory of Relativity has been invented by Einstein single-handedly. The driving force for both theories was the need to explain certain physical experiments and observations which could not be explained by existing theories. A good reference explaining change in science is Kuhn, Thomas: The Structure of Scientific Revolutions. 1962 2) Concerning epistemic relativism see $URL$ and the links within. The issue is assessed controversially. At least concerning science, I emphasize the importance of intersubjective consense of the experts about the interpretation of the relevant experiments and observations. 

There are lots of studies that connect multilingual households to higher cognitive ability. LINK Understanding one's own cultural heritage can assist children in understanding cultural diversity and tolerance. If they live in the general public they will still be exposed to various American cultural influences. 

Perhaps this is an irreverent answer but I believe the phrase "je ne sais quoi" encapsulates what you are asking. 

In general, heuristic technique supports the opposite of your claim (points towards the fallacy you are trying to name). Occam's razor, sometime referred to as the law of parsimony, argues that given multiple explanations, the one which requires the least assumptions is likely closest to the truth. This isn't providing the name of the fallacy, but is the name of a common argument against the fallacious position that complex systems require belabored complex answers. A great example of this is the pre-heliocentric mapping of the solar systems orbital paths. It was burdened with overly complex, loopty-loop tracks. This is an example of how a complex answer was in fact a symptom of an invalid assumption and an incomplete understanding if the system as a whole. In your question you refer to the complexity of human psychology. However, I believe that psychology tries to eliminate complexity and focus on the what is believed to be a common set traits and behaviors - standardizing a treatment regiment for specific situations, and less focused on specific individuals and the complexity of each one's life. 

After your comments I assume the last line claims "Exists x Likes(x,carl)". To prove the claim, take x = carl. If in line 2 you take x = carl and y = max, then line 1 with Likes(x,y) implies Likes (x,x), i.e. Likes (carl, carl), q.e.d. Do you agree? 

Here Leibniz reviews in an affirmative way one of King's claim. 3) Whether Leibniz' Theodicy solves the problem of evil is controversial between theists and atheists. Concerning the problem of pain I do not know whether any contemporary theologian considers King's claim a valid argument. 

Wigner's paper amazes any reader, notably any philospher or mathematician, see $URL$ I do not consider the paper a threat for any philosophy but a challenge, pointing to an open problem. Mathematics is the main tool to formalize physical theories, capturing their content in an unambigous way. Mathematics is the prerequisite to make any quantifiable and precise prediction or retrodiction about the events from the physical world. Conversely, mathematics is a game with arbitrary concepts and logical rules. Mathematics gets its power and precision from this simpleness as a free creation of the human mind. A game, which is often played without any physical application in mind. 

I do not see any impact of Goedel's result to epistemology. Broadly speaking, epistemology deals with the question how we recognize objects and facts from reality. It refers to the relation (issue 1) between the world (issue 2) and our model (issue 3) of the world. Goedel's result refers to the power of axiomatized theories. This issue neither refers to the world (issue 2) nor to the relation (issue 1) between world and model. At most, it refers to properties of our world models (issue 3). 

I would consider this very closely aligned with Martin Heidegger's theory posed in "Being and Time". "She never achieved her authentic self; Dasein." 

The movement towards the disapproval of discrimination is not equivalent to the elimination of differentiation. The distinction between treating everyone fairly and treating everyone the same is an important one to recognize. The key take away from the change you are describing, is the elimination of bias (or the elimination of devaluing "the other"). Issues of a polemic and orthodox application of egalitarian distribution are apparent in strict institutionalized socialism or Communism. As John Locke and Thomas Hobbs describe, society is formed on the basis of a tacit agreement between individual to create security for the individual and create opportunity through collective efforts and mutual exchange. Oppositely, Marx describes a socialist society, where these roles are reversed - Individuals serve the needs of the community united by a collective struggle. One of the largest issues with the socialist perspective is that we are not all equivalent, with the same needs, motives, or abilities. It neglects the human intuitions of being individuals first and members of a community second. Historically, the strict application of communism - though rarely expressed in a true adherence to its own values - has resulted in a stifled society. I refer to the collapse of the USSR as a result of rationing and social issues stemming from limitation on individuality. Another example is the collapse of many kibbutzim - the local level socialist communities of Israel. These groups' struggle to maintain a commitment to equality for all, has resulted in greatly diminished participation. Conversely, the competitive nature of the free market and individualism has resulted in higher incentives and greater rewards for both individuals and society. Intrinsically, scarcity requires differentiation because it cannot provide enough to satisfy everyone. Up until society reaches a point of unlimited abundance - where the maximum of each individual's needs are met by the sheer volume of resources, a healthy understanding of differentiation is important. However, it is equally important to show respect and preserve each individual's dignity by not devaluing them based on differences. Instead, it is important to provide fair opportunity until then. 

I did never found a precise proposal. Actor causality seems to me an ad-hoc explanation, hence a pseudo explanation. Freewill libertarian make an assumption which they have never tested: That we could decide other than we actually did. In order to test this claim one has to reproduce the original situation and to repeat the decision experiment. How could such experiment look like? Did anybody perform such an experiment? Hence freewill libertarian use an untested and possibly even untestable hypothesis. But first one needs the data of the experiment, than one can search for an explanation. 2) The following book of Henrik Walter deals with the whole subject on the base of neurophilosophy: $URL$ 

All can be read without studying the secondary sources before. But I would recommend to inform oneself about some biographical data of the authors. These works make a programm for about one year. In my experience it takes several years to get one's own philosophical stance. But it's worth to aim at this goal. 

As I now understand your comments your intention is to consider philosophy as a whole and to investigate the characteristics of this discipline. Such enterprise belongs to the domain of philosophy of science. I would break down your original question about the essence of philosophy into the following subitems:
