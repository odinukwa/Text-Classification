As others have pointed out, The TdF is an endurance race. It's not about all out speed. For a better idea of how bike technology has increased, check out the list of Hour record holders. This is done on an indoor velodrome, with no other people on the track to the person can't draft. The premise is to ride as far as you can in a single hour. The original record listed was only 26 KM, In 1993 the record was only 52 KM. Now the current hour record is 91 KM. That's quite a jump. 

I would go for the same way I taught my kids to ride. Take the pedals off and let her scoot around until she gets comfortable with the balancing part. Put the seat low enough so that she can touch flat footed. This will allow her to gain confidence and not worry about falling. Once the fear is gone, the rest should come reasonably quickly. 

Similar experience to @ʍǝɥʇɐɯ, although I use Shimano A530 pedals, which use an SPD cleat. They have a platform on one side, and a clip on the other side, allowing you to ride with regular shoes if you are just going out the store or some other short ride. They also allow you to keep one foot out for situations where you are anticipating having to stop quickly or frequently. They are really easy to get in and out of, and I've only fallen over a couple times, but that was more due to me not unclipping when I should have. Clip out early and often, and you really shouldn't have any problems. 

I'm replacing the crankset and bottom bracket on my old steel frame road bike, which looks like this one, so I'm guessing it's from around 1985. I picked up a 68 mm square taper bottom bracket and found that I couldn't fit the non drive side bottom bracket cup in. The drive side is fine, but the other one can't fit in at all, even with all the other parts removed (to ensure nothing was getting in the way). The old one (from a cottered crank) fits in fine and rotates without problems, and there doesn't seem to be any deformation or damage. Do I simply have the wrong part? Is the possible the part is defective? Here is a picture of the bottom bracket. I don't have calipers so I couldn't get a decent measurement, but the left cup seems bigger, and the pictures seems to confirm this. 

It is a 160 mm SRAM Centerline X2 rotor with a TRP HY-RD caliper (on a Soma Double Cross fork). Also the calipers are at the limit in the z-plane, i.e. they are pushed out away from the wheel as far as the mount will allow, so there's conceivably another issue there. Update I changed the Shimano adapter for a TRP-branded adapter. I'm not certain if it solves the problem of the grasping at this stage. I'll leave it a few days and see if it clears the outer dirt ring on the disc. However, the (related?) problem with the lateral position of the calipers is worse. With this new mount, they are pushed out as far as possible, but the outer pad still rubs against the disc. Update 2 Changing brands of adapters had little effect. In fact, the TRP-branded ones were probably slightly worse than the Shimano. I took my bike to a fourth shop to try and sort out the shuddering. They decided to put washers in, moving the calipers out. However, they used the washers that have some lateral movement (I think the same as Mike Baranczak's answer). This may have slightly fixed the z-plane issues mentioned above. The shuddering is much better, but now the brakes screech terribly, and the stopping strength is still less than expected. I will see them in a few weeks to see if they can tweak it more. I will update this question further when I have more definitive results. 

You can see that the calipers do not grasp the outer ~15% of the rotor. I imagine that if they grasped the whole outside section, braking would be slightly stronger. Also, braking currently shudders ever so slightly (although this rotor is much better than the previous one). By not grasping so much of the inside supports, this shuddering might be reduced? I went into my LBS, but they were a bit vague. They said they didn't "know the tolerance of SRAM rotors", although the previous rotor had the same issue. They also claimed that the fork was manufactured correctly, although "if I wanted to" they could fix the position, probably by spacing the HY-RD out by putting some M16 washers in. They didn't really say whether it was of concern or not. 

As far as I'm aware, Shimano and SRAM cassettes are interchangable, at least in the 8 and 9 speed range. Your derailleur should be fine. As far as the chain goes, depending on how worn it is, you might want to replace it with a new one. Mixing a worn chain with a new cassette is a sure way to wear out the cassette prematurely. Also, this is a good upgrade, as long as you don't do too many hills, as you'll be losing a few of the easier gears. I recently did a similar switch, from 11-32 to 12-23 with an 8 speed groupset and noticed a huge difference. You aren't making as drastic of a change, so I'm not sure if you'll notice it as much as I did, but having a single step between adjacent gears makes finding the right gear quite a bit easier. 

As far as commuting goes, I would pick the fixie/single speed over the other bike you linked to, and here's why. 

The following picture shows a 2010 Big Hit with a 32 tooth chainring, and you can see there is ample frame clearance. The chain device actually has to bring the chain closer to the frame. Perhaps your chain device what's causing the problem and it is bringing the chain too close to the frame. You should be able to use the bike without the chain guide as the narrow wide chainring should be enough to keep the chain on there by itself. or perhaps use a different chain guide that mounts on the top. 

A rear wheel with an internal 3 speed hub (you can get more gears if you like) should solve the problem you are having. The gearing system is kept enclosed and away from salt and dirt. It's a little expensive as you basically have to buy a new rear wheel, or relace your old one, but this is the best way to fix it. That or go completely single speed.
