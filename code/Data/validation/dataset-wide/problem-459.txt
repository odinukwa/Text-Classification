(Just up front: (1) All comparisons made keeping all other factors equal! (2) I know this is a really hard comparison, but there seems to be virtually nothing canonical on here or the rest of google, so I figured it was worth a shot to ask.) Currently I own a beautiful 80s Gazelle, full chrome, steel frame, on which I occasionally do trips of various distances. I'm struggling to cycle faster than 36 kph avg on it (no aerobars) over say 100k. I have an 8 speed, and I believe my highest gear is 12/54. Because of this I'm thinking of making an upgrade to a proper aero bike, I think it might make a difference. But how much of an impact can I really expect? I'm looking at the Canyon Aeroad CF SLX 8.0, which I might fit with ENVE 7.8 racing wheels - I'd say that's about as aero as it would get. What kind of (rough) speed improvement can I expect? 

Often it is argued that an 8 or a 20 minute effort can be sufficient to estimate Functional Threshhold Power (FTP), an indicator of how many watts a rider can put out over the course of an hour (or 40 minutes, depending on who you ask). For a 20 minute effort, it is often argued that a 5% reduction over the 20 minute wattage gives an accurate estimate of the maximum wattage for the 40-60 minute effort. For the 8 minute effort, an additional 5% (for a total of 10%) is taken off the total wattage over 8 minutes. My question is as follows: does the reverse also hold? Suppose I do an 80 minute test, or a 160 minute test, will a respective 5 or 10% increase in the wattage over that period be my FTP? 

I've been trying to fit Michelin Power Competition (AirComp inners) onto a set of Strike's. (I'm certain these are true, they were default fitted with other tires, and these had 0% wobble.) Let's just say the wheels haven't been treating me so well. I've outfitted numerous box-type wheelsets without an issue. This is a whole different story. The fitting took me about an hour in total because it's so damn tight (after much hassle I've succesfully put the tires). After inflating, spinning the wheel makes the tires look hopelessly wobbly. When I inflate to higher pressure, say 6-7 bars, I hear "clinging" noises coming from the tire that becomes seated better/closer to the edge of the rim. It doesn't look good, and I decide to fit them again. Result: Same thing. Nothing changed. Wobbly tires. Tires that make all kinds of bangs. And again. And again. I've been trying this all day long. I have no idea how to fit these tires on these wheels... Any tips on some kind of workflow / hints / secrets, so I can put this issue to rest? 

Looks like a Backward Circle Fixie. It seems the previous owner swapped out the tires/wheels, possibly painted it and/or added a decal, which to me, made it seem like a GT, but I'm not sure if GT even manufactures fixies. I didn't dig too deeply to find and snap this off the Web. The crook in the frame is unmistakable. update to research the logo on the front in your pic is a dead-wringer for the logo on their site. if it's not a BC, then it is a damn-good knock-off (though I don't see the point in that crook other than aesthetic-value). plz note--detractors to my answer fail to explain the "Backwards" logo, seen on op's photograph -- if I am wrong, then someone went WAY overboard to make it LOOK like a BC (the logo is visible, as it is on most bikes in the front of the "handle" portion of the front-fork; just below the handlebar). update to research pt. 2 "re-research" see comment (2) by ojd -- this crooked shanker design was apparently ripped off by other fixie manufacturers. Still I'm confident I've id'd this ride correctly., so I'm not changing/removing any portion of the answer, but I AM adding this notation; giving the writer credit and acknowledging that I might be wrong (sadly, it does happen sometimes). OP - plz do inform us once you hammer this one down! 

From personal exp. (yes I understand this is anecdotal...) I like to wear "flight jackets" this is the same jacket a pilot would wear or a cover-all worn on a flight deck. it is functional for the following three reasons: 

Front with a lockout for better friction on the road. rear's good for fast downhill, otherwise get a soft seat or one with a shock right underneath it. diff? front is in the fork; back is built t 45 into the frame. 

it is necessary to to slow down the rate at which you pedal (I suppose we must create a differential, in terms of pedaling) in order to get the derailleur to shift. The differential must increase (in velocity--> accelerate) in order to downshift; it must slow-down to shift up. if you've ever been cruising on a flat and up-shift; you may notice a delay between your shift and the ACTUAL shift...because you're pedaling, so what is the hold-up, right? most gears not shift gears until there is at least some change in velocity; nee the relative power we deliver to the pedals. same with hitting a steep driveway unexpectedly -- it's hard to downshift fast enough to deliver enough power (angular accel) to the pedals and thus downshift. usually I run out of velocity and have to jump off the bike if im blindsided by an unexpected steep-spot. sadly, I need to be going at least 1km/hr in order to maintain balance without a 3rd point of contact. it may seem to you like it is stalling, when really the system is waiting on the differential described. as reference - my system is an 18-speed - 2 up front, 6 in the back hybrid. the rear derailuer is brand new (and had to be custom made by shimano) -- I ate it hard and snapped the original. 

A friend of mine goes to the trouble of installing a grease nipple in the shell of each hub. Then, instead of having to take the hub apart, all you need to do is pump more grease in every so often and wipe the excess that comes out around the axle away. This has the advantage of pushing any dirt and gunk out of the bearings when you add more grease. 

As per the other responses, the main tool you need is a spoke wrench. You can use the frame itself as a truing stand. Other things to note are: 

Ok, a number of the other responses have captured some of the possibilities here. The possible causes and fixes I can think of are: 

Brooks saddles are on the way back in with the trendy fixie crowd. You can certainly see plenty of them on the streets of Sydney, and two of my friends have them on their bikes. Apparently they are pretty comfortable once broken in, just as you've said in your question. 

Finally, as others have mentioned, consider the impact of your actions on the opinions of other road users. 

Bikely is an application built on top of google maps that supports importing GPX files and displaying height profiles. 

An approach that can give you some confidence is to measure your existing bike(s) along the critical dimensions to see how they compare. To my mind (and apparently also to the mind of the late, great Sheldon Brown) the most important dimension to consider is the top tube length. Basically, you can get a certain amount of adjustment in "reach", the distance between your saddle and the handlebars by adjusting the saddle on the rails, and the stem you've got, but the range of variability is quite small. Seat posts can be extended through quite a significant range, and you can generally play around with the rise on the stem, as well as the spacers on the steerer to get a lot of vertical adjustment. So, download your specifications for the cross-check and we find that the top tube has an effective length of 570mm. Go out and measure the top tube of your current bike (or a bike you are comfortable riding) and if it is close to this, then you are good to go. 

I think the answer is definitely yes, and this is certainly the case in Australia. Of the three examples you have cited, two of them are explicitly allowed under the road rules for cycling:
