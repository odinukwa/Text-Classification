Being eaten is obviously not a process most organisms can survive. But assuming one is swallowed whole, and isn't injured before reaching the stomach, what actually ends up killing them? Acid? Heat? Pressure? Lack of oxygen? Would it necessarily be painful, or could you peacefully fade away into soup? Edit: If it makes the question less off-topic, I'm particularly interested in fictional carnivorous humanoid mammals somewhat resembling anthropomorphic wolverines swallowing rat or weasel sized mammals. They digest the creatures they ingest wholesale, bones included. 

Your duplicators may be capable of supporting the crew's dietary needs on this new advanced starship, but we didn't always have things so easy. Humans are incredibly inefficient creatures, and messy ones at that. In the earlier days of space travel, carrying enough supplies to sustain a crew on extended deep space missions was a serious challenge. People fussed about with hydroponics bays for growing food, atmosphere recyclers and waste re-processors, but as ships got bigger and missions got longer, all these complex systems became a major headache for systems engineers. Nobody wanted to design space toilets when they could be testing the next-generation of wrap engines! If only they could just fix the pesky humans that were at the heart of the problem, and make them less messy and inefficient in the first place... And then, eureka! It was invented: the solutions to all of 22nd century Earth's interstellar sanitation problems. I present to you, the C.A.N.: the Contained Abdominal Network. This brilliant piece of eco-dev tech not only completely eliminates your need for elimination, but also decreases your food and water requirements. It works by culturing a special strain of genetically engineered bacteria in special capsules throughout your gut. To these wee beasties, one man's trash is another bacterium's treasure, and in exchange for the ideal place to live they produce glucose from waste and return a fraction of it back into the bloodstream. After a few cycles through the C.A.N., there's nothing left of the body's natural waste but good old fashioned methane gas. Additional measures may need to be taken to compensate for the increased volume of gaseous discharge. With the C.A.N. managing your bowels, you'll be more free than ever to explore the cosmos efficiently and cleanly. Now offering free insertions for all crews! It won't hurt, we promise. 

That's easy! On Earth, plants use two types of pigments to absorb light for photosynthesis. The most well known of these is chlorophyll, which absorbs blue and red light and thus appears green. But plants also use a class of pigments called carotenoids, which absorb green, blue and violet light and thus appear red, orange, or yellow. It is these pigments that are largely responsible for the color of fall leaves on Earth, as well as the color of carrots, egg yolk, daffodils, and canaries. A class of carotenoids called Xanthophylls are especially yellow compared to other carotenoids which may be more orange. Carotenoids cannot operate completely on their own, and in Earth plants they must transfer their captured energy to chlorophyll, which then mobilizes electrons into the rest of the photosystem. One can imagine however a setup where the carotenoids transfer their captured solar energy into a molecule that replicates chlorophyll's ability to mobilize electrons but cannot absorb light by itself, or at least is sufficiently shielded by the carotenoids that its color (if any) doesn't show up. Essentially, you want a photosystem where carotenoids are the primary light-gathering molecules and the separate electron-mobilizing molecules are either incapable of absorbing light themselves (which is more likely evolutionarily, else the carotenoids would not necessary) or tucked away inside dense packets of carotenoids (which makes sense from a structural point of view). As to what these electron-moving molecules could be, I don't know. Chlorophyll does this using a large aromatic ring with a central metal atom, but since these types of compounds strongly absorb light they might not be ideal. So, what might lead plants to rely heavily on carotenoids and not on chlorophyll? The most obvious solution is to have a planet where the wavelengths of light available at the planet's surface are strongest in the range that carotenoids can absorb but chlorophyll can't. So the available light at the surface of your planet should be: 

Cancer is caused by mutations to critical parts of a cell's DNA causing it to reproduce at an uncontrolled rate. Usually multiple mutations must accumulate over successive cellular generations in order for a fully malignant tumor to develop. Human cells are genetically "programmed" to correct mutations (DNA repair) and to kill themselves if their DNA is irreparably damaged. But if the cell's suicide or repair mechanism is itself broken by a mutation, then further mutations can occur, leading to cancer. The immune system is tasked with killing things that it doesn't recognize as human. That's the problem with cancer that you pointed out: even if a cell mutates to rapidly reproduce and grow into harmful tumors, it will still usually register as human to an immune cell. There's actually a really simple* solution to this problem: unify the DNA repair and cellular recognition pathways. *(Actually unbelievably complicated, but "simple" in that there is a very simple underlying idea). There are many ways this could be done: transcribe short portions of the genome that are important for DNA repair, transport them to the surface of the cell, and use them as recognition sites for the immune cells. If enough of them don't match, indicating a mutation in the genome, the immune cell destroys it. Alternatively, the specific proteins and enzymes involved in DNA repair could themselves be moved to the surface of the cell and used as recognition sites. Maybe the immune cells could even present them with short fragments of DNA and see if they repair them correctly. The details are impossible to flesh out mentally, but the general idea seems perfectly biologically plausible: Force the cells to constantly express that they are reproducing and repairing their DNA correctly, or else the immune cells explode them. This wouldn't prevent mutations from occurring, but it would prevent them from accumulating. This should be enough to stop cancer from being a problem. Technically, this scheme wouldn't categorically eliminate cancer, since there could always be a mutation in the immune cells that breaks the recognition mechanism--but now we're talking about highly specific complementary mutations occurring in unrelated cell types in different tissues on the body, and enough immune cells being affected to break the system. The odds of the necessary mutations occurring in both the potentially cancerous cell and in a majority of the body's immune cells is so low that it makes cancer as we know it virtually impossible. Such a system would be remarkably unlikely to evolve on its own. A species that prevents mutations in its DNA won't be very good at evolving and will probably go extinct, so I imagine this mechanism would only appear after millions or billions of years of having a normally evolving immune system (the DNA repair mechanisms have to appear in the first place and evolve until they're good before they can be "locked in" as I'm describing). But I don't think it's too much of a stretch considering how outrageously complicated the human immune system already is. Don't expect such a system to be commonplace among alien races, but given an entire galaxy of potential and maybe a few billion years of an evolutionary head start, and I think it's believable. 

There are lots of examples in fiction of lizard people, bird people or beast people, but I'd like to expand my phylogenetic horizons in conceptualizing my world. To that end, I have conceptualized a race of large, sentient flatworm people. I am not an artist so I will spare you an attempt as visualizing my idea, but basically imagine taking one of these wee beasties 

I'm not asking for a complete dictionary or an exhaustive list of syntax of rules, just a few general principles and maybe a few examples. Looking to real-life Earth languages for inspiration is fine, but keep in mind that you are starting completely from scratch here and are free to introduce ideas not ever seen in any real language. Ultimately, it should very easy to write a scientific paper or have a formal debate in this new language, and very, very difficult to write a love sonnet, an impassioned rant, or a typical YouTube comment. I don't care if this situation seems unrealistic. These are sapient lizards living on the lip of a giant stone mushroom budding off the side of a sentient, jupiter-sized stone gyroscope floating in an infinite void of magical mists. For them, it works, and it happens this way. 

In Larry Niven's short story "Bordered in Black", there's a planet (Sirius B-IV) with much lower gravity than Earth. As a result, the planet has a gentler atmospheric pressure gradient, i.e., the air pressure changes less over the same vertical distance. Because of this, the planet had clouds as high as 130 kilometers. It got me thinking: there's a world I've been building for some time that has an extreme vertical component to its geography, with some features being hundreds (and in one extreme case, thousands) of miles tall. It occurred to me a while ago that air pressure would be a serious problem in this setting, since most of that vertical space, although not necessarily the upper- or lower-most extremes, is meant to be habitable. I initially decided to handwave it away, judging the problem to be insurmountable. Now Niven has reignited my interest in finding a scientific explanation for this. Using real physics, what are some good explanations for a range of livable air pressure extending over several hundred vertical miles? If this isn't possible, what's the largest vertical distance over which air pressure can remain can livable? Side note: the ground is made out of handwavium. I am not breaching the topic of how hundred-mile-tall features exist in this world. The air on the other hand, being breathable, is normal nitrogen-oxygen, and thus requires an explanation for its behavior. 

Quite simply, if the planet orbits both stars then they will always appear close together in the sky. If it only orbits one of them, then they will move further apart throughout the year until they are on opposite sides of the planet, before moving back again: 

Imagine an earthlike, inhabited planet with zero axial tilt (ignoring wobble) and a much higher orbital eccentricity than Earth (exact values aren't important at this point but feel free to calculate them for extra kudos). For this planet, "summer" is the time spent closest to the sun and "winter" is the time spent furthest from the sun. 

Create an alternate history in which astronomers have known about this system for centuries. The hypernova occurred aeons ago and the system migrated thousands of lightyears to reach our stellar neighborhood since then. You lose a connection to real world events, but physics is mostly preserved. I say mostly because it's still very questionable that such a system would be found in this part of the galaxy. Have a wormhole suddenly deposit the system into our galaxy from elsewhere. The hypernova occurred on the other side of the universe, where conditions beyond our current understanding of astronomy allowed the system to form as you have described. This way you maintain a connection to the real world and, considering that we really don't know what happens when black holes collide, technically don't violate any laws of physics as far as I know--you just make a few up. 

Is this species, as proposed biologically reasonable? I'm guessing there are probably some surface-area-to-volume ratio problems that I haven't considered. I'm primarily interested in getting answers as to whether or not my current proposal is realistic, but bonus points for suggesting solutions to make it possible should it prove to be impossible as written. 

In the world I'm currently building, there are many species, each with their own language. Most of these languages evolved naturally over time, much like here on Earth. But there is one race (let's call them the "T") that have a different situation. Long ago, they were an industrious and down-to-earth reptilian people with a language like any other, with technology comparable to mid-20th century America. But then a violent revolution took place and their society changed dramatically. The new government's goal is to develop the technology necessary to achieve a post-scarcity economy and to make their race practically invulnerable to natural disaster or military attack. They also want to stamp out their more animalistic side and make people rely more on reason. In order to reach these goals, they abolish all personal rights and conscript as much of the population as possible as scientists, engineers, teachers, and soldiers. Their society becomes one giant machine dedicated to science. Now, the T do not have the same obsession with freedom that those pesky humans living across the ocean do, and most of the population is okay with the new way of doing things, even if it wouldn't be their first choice. But some resist the ideals of the new society, and others struggle to adapt to a society obsessed with science, logic and structure even though they support the government's goals. After thousands of years, however, this resistance is eventually overcome, and the T not only reign supreme as their world's sole undisputed economic and military ultrapower, but the people love their authoritarian society, and scientific, rational thought is now an intuitive and emotionally satisfying part of their culture. A huge part of the success of the revolution's long term success was the government's ability to manipulate the way that subsequent generations thought. Not by brainwashing, torture, or other uncivilized means: they're totalitarian, but they're also idealist utopians, and they want the people to honestly support their goals. They can't use use force, at least not excessively. But what they can use is language. Now, imagine that you are the first Supreme Social Architect of the new T state, and you are tasked with creating a new written and spoken language for your people that will gradually change the way that the T conceive of the world until you achieve your totalitarian scientific utopia. What kind of language do you come up with? Your goals are to:
