Suppose the group $G$ is simple; the general case should be similar. Let $\Gamma$ be the subgroup of $W$ generated by all Coxeter elements and suppose $W$ is generated by the simple reflections $s_i$, where $i\in I$ and $|I|=l$. For distinct $i,j\in I$ consider two Coxeter elements $c_1:=s_is_j\prod_{k\ne i,j}s_k$ and $c_2=s_js_i\prod_{k\ne i,j}s_k$. Then $c_1,c_2\in \Gamma$ as all Coxeter elements are conjugate in $W$, implying $s_is_js_is_j=c_1c_{2}^{-1}\in \Gamma$. If the roots $\alpha_i$ and $\alpha_j$ have the same length and are linked on the Dynkin graph of $W$ then $(s_is_j)^3=1$. By interchanging the roles of $i$ and $j$ we then deduce that $s_is_j\in\Gamma$ for all such $i$ and $j$. If all roots of $G$ have the same length then it is immediate from the above that $s_is_j\in \Gamma$ for all $i,j\in I$. But then the derived subgroup $[W,W]$ is contained in $\Gamma$. As it has index $2$ in $W$ we deduce that $\Gamma=[W,W]$ if $l$ is even and $\Gamma=W$ if $l$ is odd. When $G$ has roots of different lengths one has to use some case-by-case arguments. This is especially easy for types $B_{2n}$, $C_{2n}$ and $G_2$ where we still have that $\Gamma=[W,W]$. 

A more precise description of positive roots $\gamma$ such that $\mu=\lambda-\gamma$ can be found in the paper $URL$ See, in particular, Proposition 1 and Lemma 3. 

To each unipotent element $u\in G$ one assigns its weighted Dynkin diagram which is basically a map $\Delta\colon\, \Pi\rightarrow \{0,1,2\}$ where $\Pi$ is a basis of simple roots of the root system of $G$. From $\Delta$ one can read off the characters on ${\mathfrak g}={\rm Lie}(G)$ of a maximal torus $T_0$ of an ${\rm SL}_2$ subgroup containing $u$ (all such subgroups are $G$-conjugate in characteristic $0$ by a classical result of Kostant, as David Stewart pointed out in his comment). If $\Delta(\alpha)=1$ for some $\alpha\in \Pi$ then $\mathfrak g$ has a faithful composition factor for the adjoint action of ${\rm SL}_2$. If $\Delta(\Pi)\subseteq \{0,2\}$ then all weights of $T_0$ on $\mathfrak g$ are even which implies that $-1\in{\rm SL}_2$ acts trivially on $\mathfrak g$. So the case of ${\rm PSL}_2$ occurs if and only if $\Delta(\Pi)\subseteq \{0,2\}$. In this case $u$ is sometimes referred to as even. All one has to do now (for $G$ exceptional) is to open Carter's book on groups of Lie type and examine the list of Dynkin labels on pp. 401--406. For $G$ classical it is explained in Carter's book how to construct $\Delta$ from the partition associated with $u$. So it fairly straightforward to figure out which unipotent elements are even for $G$ classical. Although any even unipotent element of $G$ has to be Richardson, there are plenty of them around. For example, all distinguished unipotent elements of $G$ are even. 

In Bourbaki, Ch. VIII, $\S$ 7, Sect. 2, one can find the notion of an $\mbox{$R$-saturated set}$, and Corollary to Prop. 4 in that section proves that for every $R$-saturated set $\mathcal X$ there is a finite dimensional $\mathfrak g$-module whose set of weights coincides with $\mathcal X$. Prop. 6 in the next sections proves that the smallest $R$-saturated sets have the form $W.\lambda$ where $\lambda$ is minuscule. This answers Question (1). For Question (2) we take for $\mathcal X$ the union of $0$ and the set of all short roots in $R$. It is easy to see that this is an $R$-saturated set as verifying this reduces to root systems of rank 2 where everything is clear (even in type ${\rm G}_2$). Applying the above-mentioned Corollary we get a $\mathfrak g$-module with desired properties. If $\beta$ is the dominant short root then, by construction, our set will coincide with the set of weigths of $L(\beta)$ as that set cannot be any smaller. 

The Lichnerowicz vanishing theorem says that if on a compact 4-dimensional spin manifold there exists a metric whose scalar curvature $R>0$, then there are no harmonic spinors; $$D\psi=0 \implies \psi=0$$ This follows from the Bochner-type formula $$D^2=\nabla^*\nabla + \displaystyle\frac{R}{4}$$ by applying it to a spinor field $\psi$ and pairing with $\psi$ to obtain $$\int \, \rvert D\psi\rvert^2 \,dV = \int \, \vert \nabla\psi \rvert^2 \, dV + \displaystyle\frac{R}{4}\int \, \rvert \psi \rvert^2 \, dV$$ from which the statement follows directly. My question is about whether there's a sort of converse to this reasoning. That is, suppose we have a compact Riemannian spin manifold and we know that there are no solutions to $D\psi = 0$ except the trivial one $\psi=0$. Does it follow that $R\ge 0$ (hopefully with $R>0$ at some point)? My vague intuition for the plausibility of this is the following: Staying away from the zero section, we know that as you range over all spinor fields, the LHS of the integral formula above is strictly positive. Suppose $R<0$ at some point. Is there enough "flexibility" in our choice of spinor field to localize near this negative value and make the RHS negative (by making the second term dominate the first in absolute value) so as to generate a contradiction? 

The other day I happened to be browsing this page on wikipedia: $URL$ In the middle of the page is the equation $$\square\phi+\lambda\phi^3=0$$ where $\square$ is the spacetime Laplacian. This is the Euler-Lagrange equation for a scalar field theory with a quartic potential. By coincidence, I also happened to be thinking about the Yamabe problem in dimension 4, and was browsing Parker and Lee's article on the subject $URL$ If you plug n=4 into equation (1.2) on page 2 of that article, you get $$(6\Delta+R)\phi=\lambda\phi^3$$ where $\Delta$ is the Laplacian with positive spectrum. This is the equation that must be satisfied by a conformal change to a metric with constant scalar curvature. At a glance it is clear that these equations are basically the same. I tried Googling to see if there was any literature on this similarity. I assume someone else must have noticed this before, but couldn't find anything. I know that the Yamabe problem is a fundamental classical problem in Riemannian geometry, and that $\phi^4$ field theory is fundamental to physics (Witten, writing for mathematicians, discusses it a bit on page 382 here $URL$ so it doesn't necessarily strike me as idle to wonder about a connection. Is anyone aware of whether there is anything to this observation? Is it just a coincidence? Or does it suggest some physical model associated with the Yamabe problem? (Hopefully you agree that the connection is suggestive enough to overlook how ill-drawn my questions are.) 

Suppose we have a Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ and a fixed vector field $X$. Consider the following equations for a 2-form $F$: $$dF=0$$ $$(\delta-\iota_X) F=0$$ Here, $\delta$ is the codifferential i.e. the adjoint of $d$ and $\iota_X$ is interior multiplication. Has anyone seen such a system before? It came up naturally in something I was looking at. I'm interested whether there are general existence results for $F$ (perhaps maybe for a restricted class of $X$?). I'd be more than pleased if anyone knew merely where to turn to in the literature to read about such a system. Thanks. 

I now believe that the statement in question (from the paper), "... the Riemannian connection $\bar\nabla$ of $M$... is compatible with $<\,,\,>$ but not with $(\,,\,)$" is false. It seems that both products are compatible with the connection $\bar\nabla$. As far as I can tell, the argument about parallel transport that I outlined above is correct, and the source of my confusion was a relatively trivial one with the spinorial Gauss equation. I'd like to outline how the spinorial Gauss equation is consistent with the parallel transport picture. I'll reference the arxiv document, page 7, that was linked at the end of the original post. The spinorial Gauss equation as stated in this link (and using the notation from the Parker/Taubes paper; sorry for the possible annoyance) is $$\nabla_X\phi=\bar\nabla_X\phi-\displaystyle\frac{1}{2}h(X)\cdot e_0\cdot\phi$$ Here $h$ is the second fundamental form, thought of as an endomorphism of the tangent bundle, i.e. the shape operator. The minus sign (as opposed to the $+$ in the link; hope I have this right, though it shouldn't affect the remainder of the argument) is due to the fact that $e_0$ is lightlike, which doesn't factor in to the Riemannian situation. Now, we want to see if $\bar\nabla$ is compatible with $(\,,\,)$. First note that $\nabla$ is compatible with $(\,,\,)$, so $$X(\phi,\psi)=(\nabla_X\phi,\psi)+(\phi,\nabla_X\psi)=(\bar\nabla_X\phi,\psi)+(\phi,\bar\nabla_X\psi)-\displaystyle\frac{1}{2}[(h(X)\cdot e_0\cdot\phi,\psi)+(\phi,h(X)\cdot e_0\cdot\psi)]$$ which shows compatibility if $(h(X)\cdot e_0\cdot\phi,\psi)+(\phi,h(X)\cdot e_0\cdot\psi)=0$. To this end, we recall (see the Parker/Taubes paper) that Clifford multiplication is Hermitian with respect to $(\,,\,)$. Thus $$(h(X)\cdot e_0\cdot\phi,\psi)=(e_0\cdot\phi,h(X)\cdot\psi)=(\phi,e_0\cdot h(X)\cdot\psi)=-(\phi,h(X)\cdot e_0\cdot\psi)$$ which cancels out the other term. This establishes that $\bar\nabla$ on $M$ is compatible with $(\,,\,)$. 

I agree with the answer below, but to turn it into a rigorous proof one could argue in a slightly different fashion: Let $l$ be the length of $w$ and let $Red(w)$ be the set of $all$ reduced expressions for $w$. Given ${\bf r}=(i_1,\ldots, i_l)\in Red(w)$ denote by $k({\bf r})$ the smallest $k\le l$ such that $i_k$ appeas in $\bf r$ more than once. Let ${\bf t}=(j_1,\ldots, j_l)\in Red(w)$ be such that $k({\bf t})\ge k({\bf r})$ for all ${\bf r}\in Red(w)$. Write $w=s_{j_1}\cdots s_{j_l}$ and let $w'$ be the element of $W$ obtained from $w$ by deleting $s_{j_k}$ from the above expression where $k=k({\bf t})$. By the choice of $k$ any reduced expression for $w'$ will have full support. Repeat this step until the length decreases to $r+1$. 

The uniqueness can break down very badly in positive characteristic. Supose $G=SL_p$ where $p$ is the characteristic of the base field. Take a regular nilpotent element $e$ in $\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{sl}_p$. Then there is a nilpotent element $f\in\mathfrak{g}$ such that $e$, $f$ and $h=[e,f]$ form an $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-triple with the property that $h^p=h$. Note that the identity matrix $I$ is in $\mathfrak{g}$. It is easy to see that there is $f_0\in\mathfrak{g}$ such that $[e,f_0]=I$ (many lecturers find this fact useful when explaining that Lie's theorem can fail in characteristic $p$). Let $\lambda$ be a scalar such that $\lambda^p\ne \lambda$. Since $h$ commutes with $I$ and $ad\ h$ is semisimple, we may assume further that $[h,f_0]=-2f_0$. Then $(e,h+\lambda I, f+\lambda f_0)$ is another $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-triple containing $e$. If the spans $\mathfrak{s}_1$ and $\mathfrak{s}_2$ of the triples are conjugate under $G$, then restricting the $p$-dimensional vector representaion of $\mathfrak{sl}_p$ to $\mathfrak{s}_1$ and $\mathfrak{s}_2$ we would get equivalent representations of $\mathfrak{sl}_2$. However, the representation we get from $\mathfrak{s}_1$ is restricted whereas the one we get from $\mathfrak{s}_2$ is not. So the triples are not conjugate under $C_G(e)$. One can replicate this example inside any Lie algebra of a reductive group $\widetilde{G}$ whch contains $G$ as a closed subgroup. 

I think so. This can be deduced from the classification of cubic forms in 3 varibles; see Tadayuki Abiko, Classification of cubic forms with three variables, Hokkaido Math. J. Vol. 10, 1981, 239-248. Google is the quickest way to find this paper which is freely available via Project Euclid. 

This is VERY far from being true: consider the $3$-dimensional Heisenberg Lie algebra $L$ with basis $a$, $b$, $c$ and the only nonzero bracket $[a,b]=c$ (so $c$ is central in $L$). Consider the linear function $\rho$ on $L$ such that $\rho(c)=1$ and $a,b\in \ker\rho$. Assume the base field $K$ has characteristic $p>2$ and consider the $p$-dimensional vector space $V$ over $K$ with basis $v_0,v_1,\ldots, v_{p-1}$. Set $v_{-1}=v_p=0$ and define a linear action of $L$ on $V$ by setting $a.v_i=iv_{i-1}$, $b.v_i=v_{i+1}$ and $c.v_i=v_i$ for all $i$. It is straightforward to check that this is a $p$-dimensional irreducible representation of $L$. Identify $a,b,c$ with their images in $\mathfrak{gl}(V)$. Then $a^p=b^p=0$ an $c^p=c={\rm Id}_V$. Since $p>2$, applying Jacobson't formula for $p$-th powers we get $$(\lambda a+ \mu b+\nu c-\nu {\rm Id}_V)^p=\lambda^p a^p+\mu^p b+\nu^pc-\nu^p{\rm Id}_V=\nu^pc-\nu^p {\rm Id}_V=0$$ for all $\lambda,\mu,\nu\in K$. It remains to note that $\rho(\lambda a+\mu b+\nu c)=\nu$. 

I think ${\rm Aut}(\Delta(B,T))$ doesn't always split: there are some very serious obstructions for that. According to a recent result of Skip Garibaldi ad Philippe Gille on algebraic groups with few subgroups, published in PLMS, there exist groups $G$ of type ${\rm D}_4$ whose all proper connected subgroups defined over the base field are abelian (such groups are necessarily anisotrpic). If the extension in question splits then $\rm Aut(G)$ contains an involution which acts on the Dynkin graph by interchanging two nodes and fixing the rest. The fixed point group of such an involution would contain a connected reductive subgroup or semisimple rank $3$ defined over the base field. However, such subgroups cannot exist in the forms of type ${\rm D}_4$ constructed by Garibaldi and Gille.
