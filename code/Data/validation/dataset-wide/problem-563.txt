If you can, try taking a bus or carpooling or something on Wednesday, to give you a midweek recovery day— muscles need a chance to recover to strengthen. If you don't have a transportation alternative, try leaving some extra time and taking it easy on the ride. Your gear ratio is indeed very high, as well: 45-15 is around 80 gear inches. I'm a daily 13-mile RT commuter on a fixed gear (including a ~150ft climb), and I just moved down from ~80 gear inches to 75 gear inches for comfort, despite being an experienced cyclist and hillclimber. Presuming you have a flip-flop hub, I would buy a 17T freewheel for an easier ride, at least until you get stronger. That'd give you 70 gear inches, which would be around 15% less effort, and you'd be able to coast. 

If you want to carry a full-sized hiking backpack, your best option might be securing it into a BOB-type trailer. A big backpack would be hard to mount to one side of a bicycling without doing terrible things to weight distribution. I have a 25L Timbuk2 Especial Viaje backpack/pannier for commuting, and it works well for that but is already pretty heavy on one side of the bike when loaded up. The plastic pannier hardware also isn't super rugged— I broke one of the hooks and had to send for a replacement after a minor fall while taking a short tour. edit: Actually, though, I haven't heard about the Richard Jones Convertible in another answer before. It looks like the real best answer to this question, and appears to be designed for exactly this purpose. 

You can indeed upgrade an older frame to more gears, by installing a cassette hub wheel. It's generally more expensive to rebuild a wheelset on an existing hubs than to buy a decent pre-built set, so it's likely you'll want to replace the wheels with a 700c set. Then you can install brifters to shift the cassette, though you'll probably also want to replace the rear derailleur with one designed for indexing. You'll probably need to cold-set the frame, as well. A simpler way to bring shifters onto the bars is to use an old set of Suntour friction barend shifters. Installing a modern freewheel with ramped teeth also makes for simpler shifting. 

You will likely be using at least one of the hubs outside of its maximum torque specification when riding in a low gear. Here's a random thread about a guy breaking a NuVinci by overtorquing it with a gas motor assist: $URL$ 

In the past, I've found that riding in the drops could help with back pain on long climbs, especially out of the saddle. Dunno if it works for you, but it's easy to try. 

Bearings and races are made of very hard steel. So long as they are properly maintained (lubricated and adjusted to the correct tightness; visit Free Ride in Pittsburgh for help lubing/adjusting your bike if it's feeling worn and you don't want to pay a shop to do it for you), they should hold up with no problem.

I toured Shikoku recently. I was also nervous about the tunnels, but had no problems at all. Japanese drivers are very safe and polite, and on Shikoku seem very cautious in tunnels due to the many pilgrims walking the island's 88 temples: $URL$ I don't recall the air being particularly bad, either. Most tunnels also have sidewalks. I ran into one 1km long bike-pedestrian tunnel that I had all to myself in the complete middle of nowhere— Japan loves to overinvest in infrastructure: $URL$ 

If you are planning for a loaded tour, lightweight equipment is the opposite of what you want— the bike is a relatively small proportion of the total weight of bike + gear. Strong wheels are one of the most important components, since failures are difficult to repair and have potential to end the trip— overbuilt wheels with a high spoke count for redundancy are what you want. Different handlebars are a good modification— trekking bars are a common setup used on mountain bikes used for touring. Hub gears other than the Rohloff generally aren't used for loaded touring, since hauling a bike with 50 pounds of gear up a mountain pass requires very low gears, and high gears are fun for bombing down the pass on the other side. The Rohloff also seems to have the best reputation for reliability for a touring bike. But they are very expensive, and work best with frames with dropouts specifically designed for the hub. 

I have a breathable backpack from Vaude. It helps a bit, but if you get sweaty during the ride, your shirt still gets wet with sweat wherever the straps are. Panniers work much, much better. 

Your best option is to sell your bike and buy another better-fitting used model. If that isn't possible, know that bike fitting is as much by convention as by natural law, and that many early safety bicycles had what we now consider very large frames for the rider: $URL$ To compensate, bicycles of that era used rear-facing handlebars, which significantly shortened their reach. Velo Orange makes similar handlebars today, and you could potentially refit your bike to fit you by purchasing a pair. Be aware that the handlebar diameter may differ, and you should learn and research what that means for your stem/brake levers/shifters. You may want to add a top-tube pad to protect your crotch in the case of rapid dismount, as well. 

There's no such thing as a 'best' bike or bike part— most just optimize for different things. Even cheap parts are optimized for low cost. You'll need to give more information on what you want to use the bike for. Building a fixie could take a week if you go to your local bike store, tell them you have no budget limit, and ask them to order you some parts and build them up. Or if you slowly accumulate perfect matching vintage parts, it could take a year or more. Note that if you're optimizing for cost, since 2008 or so, it's pretty much always been cheaper to buy a pre-built fixie than building one from scratch, or converting a road bike. 

You can mail order good ol' fashioned rubber pedals: $URL$ Since they're Pyramid brand, American bike stores probably can order them too. 

Both bicycles have similar components (the Gravity slightly nicer drivetrain, but with a cheapo looking seatpost, etc) and are manufactured in similar facilities in China or Taiwan. The Trek will be set up and fitted by your local bike shop, which will be very helpful if your local bike shop is competent (some aren't). The Gravity will be set up & fitted by you unless you can find a bike shop to pay $50-$150 to do that work for you-- many won't want to do that work on a bike they haven't sold. My girlfriend has a Gravity that she's used as a commuter for the past two years in addition to some touring & road rides, and it's done well— it's a perfectly competent cheap bike. If you yourself were skilled at working on bikes, or have a friend who's willing to help you fit & assemble your bike in exchange for some beers, you'll get a much better value out of the Gravity. But since it sounds like you're not in that situation, and it's fall when bikes go on sale, you'll probably do better buying a Trek/Giant/whatever from a good bike shop on clearance. 

Unless you are of extremely uncommon proportions, you won't find much riding advantage in a custom-made bike— there's plenty of room to tweak a mass-production bike for the a perfect fit through component swaps. Moreover, unless you buy from an experienced touring-bike specialist, it's entirely possible that a custom-designed bike might have little annoyances that'd get caught in the prototype phase for production bike. Most great cycling adventures have been taken on a mass-production bike of some sort. I rode across the USA on a used $300 Fuji, and it was fine (though a better wheelset would have been worthwhile had I had the budget). I've taken medium-distance tours on a 30 year old Schwinn Varsity, too, which meets all your criteria except packability— that bike fits fat tires, has comfy relaxed geometry, and you can fix pretty much everything on it with an adjustable wrench. By all means, if you have plenty of money and would enjoy a custom bike, buy one, but if funds are limited, I'd spend them on travel as opposed to the bike. 

The Topeak Road Morph G is an excellent pump. I have one that's served probably 5 years at this point with no problems, only requiring a spot of grease in the cylinder after 4 years or so. It definitely gets up to 100+PSI, and costs $30. The gauge isn't great but it's better than just feeling the tire. Pumping up the tire to high pressure definitely requires a lot more effort than a floor pump, but the floor pump position allows you to put your weight into pumping up the tire so you can get up to high pressures. The Lezyne Micro Floor Drive is apparently a reputable pump too, though apparently a piece of plastic on its hose is breakage-prone. 

If you are camping in the forest, many folks are fans of a camping hammock, which is lightweight and doesn't require a sleeping pad in warm weather. $URL$ $URL$ Note, for the sake of Googling, that off-road lightweight bike touring is often referred to as 'bikepacking'. 

The fixed-gear generation having aged into parenthood, one sees such bikes commonly enough in Brooklyn. I just used a singlespeed for a short loaded tour because my touring bike is broken. It was fine. 

I have the Timbuk2 Especial Viaje convertible backpack/pannier which I use to commute with my work laptop, a MBP 15" Retina. It uses the same rack-attachment hardware as the current edition of the Timbuk2 Shift. That hardware has broken 4 times in my ~8 months of owning the bag. Timbuk2 has been good about sending replacement hardware, but it's still not fun to have to maintain the bag that much, especially considering Timbuk2 sells their bags as being very durable. They're now offering me store credit to get a new bag, but they don't have any equivalent bag currently available, and won't until 2015, so I'll take them up in fall after the hot, sweaty summer is over. I wonder if they only tested the all-plastic hardware in SF's very mild climate, as opposed to somewhere with seasons— perhaps using the bag through the winter weakened the plastic? I also had a previous edition of the Timbuk2 Shift, which had even worse pannier hardware with 2 hooks held in by tiny little pins as its only points of support. When one of the hooks fell off because its tiny pin slipped out, I was very lucky the bungee the bag had didn't get caught in my rear wheel and cause a crash, which would have been especially bad in lower Manhattan traffic. So, I guess my answer is: I suggest the Ortlieb as they're a lot more experienced with manufacturing/sourcing durable pannier hardware. Or maybe look into the Arkel as well: $URL$ If you do want the Shift, REI has it: $URL$ And it's nice to be able to take advantage of their return policy, if you need it as I did. 

Here's a 2-speed using a chain tensioner & front derailleur, but without much of a gear difference: $URL$ If you want to use a rear derailleur, you probably want to make sure you're using a mountain or road triple derailleur with a long cage so you have sufficient 'tooth capacity', as mentioned above. And if you're using a vintage part, make sure the spring isn't worn out. There are also several examples of retro-direct conversions on the internet, which are a 2-speed bicycle with 2 cogs, each having the freewheel clutch operating in the opposite direction, and the chain running around both. You engage one cog by pedaling forward and the other by pedaling backward. This allows for a pretty significant difference in gear ratios. Here's a bunch of pictures from a Czech dude: $URL$ There are a bunch of other examples out there if you search for 'retrodirect'. I wouldn't put too big of a bet on the durability of such a cobbled setup, though. Speaking as someone who's ridden across the US, you'll want a very low gear for cranking an ~80-ish lb. loaded touring bike up 4000'+ passes— probably close to, or even below, 1:1. You'll want a relatively low gear just for cruising all day at 12 or 13mph when you're lugging that weight. You'll probably want another gear for days when you're fighting a headwind all day, and another for when you're sailing the prairies on a mighty tailwind at 25mph+. And when you're lugging your touring load up and down rolling hills in, say, Kentucky, you'll want to change gears rather often. I reckon what I'm saying is that gears are really great for a cross-country touring bike, which sees incredibly varied conditions under very heavy load, even if gears are not so necessary around town. Even if you're on a really tight budget, something like the Windsor Tourist is pretty cheap, and you can find things even cheaper on the used market this time of year, especially considering you have 3 or 4 months until a summer and the likely start of a tour. 

Tri-flow now makes a soy-based chain lube: $URL$ A big ol' jug of soybean oil from the grocery store has the problems noted elsewhere. 

Ghostride it, so long as you're not dealing with high speeds or heavy traffic: $URL$ And make sure you have a soundtrack: 

Very few bicycle brands manufacture their own bicycles, other than perhaps top-end racing bikes. One exception is Giant, which is one of the largest bicycle manufacturers, but they don't make steel bikes anymore so far as I know. One of the major manufacturers of steel bikes these days is a company in Taiwan called Maxway: $URL$ They sell steel bicycle frames of all types, including racing bikes, to many bike brands, likely including one in your country. Taiwanese sellers also often sell bikes and frames directly via eBay, if there isn't a local brand. One American brand that uses Maxway frames, well-reputed for durability, is Surly. Their road model is the Pacer: $URL$ They have dealers in India, though apparently not in your state: $URL$ Surlys are often a couple pounds heavier than competitively-priced bikes, in exchange for being much harder to break. 

I sight down the middle of the bike and line up components on the bike centerline, like the stem, top tube, seat tube, BB shell, etc. 

Bob Mionske has been banging the insurance drum for years, and has a column from two years ago that links to an insurance product that's theoretically coming soon: $URL$ $URL$ Better World Club briefly offered such a service for bicycle members, but apparently discontinued it: $URL$ American liability insurance requirements are far lower than those in Germany, unfortunately, because we have structured our society so that, outside a few major cities, just about every idiot out there needs to be able to drive in order to live a normal life. California's minimum liability requirement is $15,000, which is exhausted in approximately 3 seconds in an American hospital: $URL$ 

It sounds like the main problem with your bike is that the position is too low. Is your stem already at its highest possible position? If so, it's still relatively easy to raise the bars. You can buy a stem extender as a cheaper option: $URL$ Or a tall stem as a more elegant option: $URL$ You may also need to replace your cables and cable housing if your handlebars are significantly higher, but that's not a bad idea on an older bike in any case. Either way, you'll spend $100 or less on the upgrade. 

Converting a mountain bike to a drop bar bike isn't a process that is likely to save money unless you are very careful with parts selection so you don't make mistakes, and spend a lot of time hunting for just-right used parts at bargain prices. Moreover, generally one would desire a larger MTB frame for drop bar use than for a standard MTB setup. However, people have had good results with such a project. Note that you can buy a decent-quality 8-speed cyclocross bike for $400 from Bikesdirect, and you can probably sell your MB-4 for $150, which would make the net cost of getting purpose-built 700c cyclocross bike $250. That should be your max budget if you're trying to save money, as opposed to build a cool bike on a frame that has sentimental value to you. If you're committed to this project, watch eBay and Craigslist for cheap 7-speed brifters & drop bars. But be prepared for the bike to fit oddly, and potentially to have a heck of a lot of seat-to-bar drop unless you have a really upright stem: $URL$ (Note that bike has relatively little seatpost exposed for an MTB— you probably only want to attempt the conversion if you have a similar amount or less seatpost exposed)
