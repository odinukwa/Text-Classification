When riding in traffic/city areas, your ears are almost as important as your eyes for keeping safe. And wearing a full face motorbike style helmet would severely limit your hearing. Add that to the excellent points Brian and Meagar make above about full face helmets being hot and heavy. 

I rode nothing but a single speed (as opposed to fixed gear) 24" Bontrager Cruiser (like a big BMX) for approx 8 years and loved it. Daily commute (~10-15Km round trip) and most other incidental/social travel. I have only recently changed to a 8 speed Charge Tap due to moving to a very hilly neighborhood. For me, the beauty of single speed is the simplicity. @Jay Bazuzi called it ; ) No worrying about what gear I should be in. Just stand up and pedal harder. No worrying about gears slipping or being tuned properly. Chain tight, done. No worrying about which brake lever to pull and how hard. Only had one to choose from. I also loved the feeling of being more 'connected' to the road than on a geared bike. (I've never owned a fixie but I'm told they feel even more 'connected' than a single speed.) And they look super-clean too. A single brake lever/cable is the only 'external' element on the bike. 

Please excuse my terminology, I have a Specialized Tricross (2008) with Shimano Tiagra STI levers, and convenience brakes on the top of the bars, running through the same cable. Naturally, adjusting brakes is easy enough, but I have a very sharp pull on the (flat bars, if I can call them that) - and my STIs pull almost all the way to the stop before even engaging. Can this be a case of badly adjusted brakes? I asked my Bike shop to service the bike (minor service) - and it came back more or less like this, it's not dangerous, at all - but I like a very short pull on my brakes after a nasty TFCC injury that still isn't recovered. I've checked the manuals for the STI levers (I expected some kind of internal setting I could crank on these, and have them take up the slack from the ) Whilst we're at it, what's the proper name for these inline top-brakes? 

I've just tried cleaning my chain and cogs with some really hot water and washing-up liquid. I also used a toothbrush, j-cloth and a non-scratch scourer. After over an hour of some serious elbow grease I could shift some of the outer dirt and muck, but still can't get the base layer of grease off. What can I use to completely strip the grease and muck off the chain? 

As well as these great answers I think it's also important to set a good example when driving. Before I cycled on the roads (I used to be purely offroad rider) I never gave much thought to cyclists, just squeezed past like everyone else. Now I do the following: 

My first piece of advice to you would be - "be prepared to fall, because you will". I remember the first time I used clipless pedals. I finished a ride, got back to the house, went to put the feet on the floor. JAMMED! Panicked, slowly fell to the side. But don't worry, you'll soon get used to it. I definitely wouldn't go back to toe straps now. 

It turns out that it was a stiff link, stripping the chain off the bike, dousing it in brake cleaner, then oil and leaving it to bathe a few minutes, then repeating the process left the chain rust and dirt free, looking like new. When I took off the chain, I broke it at the stuck link (which was clearly evident going through the derailleur when pedalling the bike backwards) -- cleaned everythingh whilst I had the opportunity and reassembled. Whilst the chain was off, I did measure it, and things were within tolerance, although (I assume naturally) a little stretched. Thanks for the help, I now have again a reliable bike! 

I'm attempting to refurbish a bike that I was given, it has a (not sure what brand) coaster brake, which according to sheldon brown's site has a peculiar kind of cone nut. The wheel might be 10 years old, it's hard to say. I've been able to remove the otherwise butchered nuts (see below) using a tap & hammer and an axle vice, now that they are free I'd like to know what they are, so that I can replace them, do they have a special name? I've only ever seen mention of cone nuts resembling a regular washer, but with two flat sides (sorry for the poor explanation) - these that this bike is fitted with are something different, see below: 

Does anyone have any experience or references on when it is ok to start putting a child in a bike child seat/carrier? I am aware that our child will need some extra neck strength to not bobble around too much with the added weight of having a helmet on his head. 

Bad idea. As Curtis said, dirt will stick to it like crazy. The only dirt that won't come off with a hose is dirt that has been on there for days/weeks and has baked itself on. So just clean your ride regularly and it shouldn't be a problem. The paint finish on bikes is so smooth that dirt shouldn't really be able to 'grab' onto it anyway. Maybe if you are riding an old bike covered in rust it might be an idea but otherwise I'd just leave it as is. 

I use a RunKeeper app for my phone (available for both iPhone & Android devices). It's really good and their site is pretty neat too. It does full GPS tracking (for free) and you can manually create routes and enter activities (despite the name it isn't just for running, in fact I even use it for open water swimming). 

I was out on a ride yesterday and several times when I was changing up and down between big chain ring and little chain ring (I only have the 2 rings up front) it required 2 gear changes. The gears actually settled on an imaginary middle cog! How can I fix this? 

Try not hugging the edge of the road, drivers will be more tempted to squeeze past through smaller gaps if you're right at the edge. Instead ride about 1/4 of the way across the lane, it might p*** off a few drivers, but it will make them think twice about squeezing past with overtaking traffic / parked cars / etc. 

I have two bicycles that suffer this problem, both pretty heavy frames (one a ladies, Hollander bike, and the other a man's commuter) - both have correctly adjusted Derailleurs which don't produce any noise or rub on the chain during normal riding. However with both, on flat ground, at nominal speed - once every 3-10 revolutions of the chain it will simply skip; there's no drive for a quarter of a turn and then everything is OK. I had originally assumed that this was a misalignment, or normal chain-skip (as I had only noticed it under heady load, cycling hard out of the saddle. However noticing the same happens on my girlfriend's bike, and on mine when I'm taking it easy disconcerts me, and leaves me with little confidence in the bike. I'm not sure where to start diagnosing, however I suspect that stripping the drive train might be a startâ€¦ perhaps also examining the chain for nipped-links, and the sprockets for damaged teeth (although, both bikes have a bash-guard on the front sprocket) Any help or advice greatly appreciated, I'm a pretty handy motorcycle mechanic, but I always found working on my Human powered bikes a lot more fiddly :) 

Weight & Price are the two downsides I can see. Having said that, I suffered with thorn punctures for a long time and it got to the stage where I was fixing a puncture every single week. In the end I went to my bike shop and asked for a recommendation. Since then I haven't had a single puncture. The puncture-resistant inner tubes are about twice as thick as a regular inner tube. Unless you're into your racing and every gram makes a difference, I would definitely recommend fitting some thicker puncture-resistant inner tubes. 

It sounds like obvious stuff, but I've been watching the drivers behind me in my rear-view mirror and a lot of them will copy the same overtaking manuevoure as you. The more drivers we can get to overtake safely, the safer we'll all be.
