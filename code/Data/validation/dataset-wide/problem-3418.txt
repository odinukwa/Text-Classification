It appears therefore that the OP focuses on issues of global income/wealth inequality, and he thinks that, under a common currency, redistribution would be easier... ...The OP fails to see that, in order to have a global currency, it would take a "geopolitical will" from the parties involved, which, if it existed, the contribution of a common currency as a "redistribution facilitator" would be negligible. One important reason of why we do not have a global common currency, has to do with the fact that we do not feel that much "connected", truly "parts of a single whole". Hence, wealth redistribution to the extent imagined by the OP is not something universally desired. Because if such a sense of being part of a single whole was the dominant flavor of human existence, the desire to redistribute would flow rather naturally from it, and then it could actually happen whether we had a common currency or not. Now I am voting to close also. 

Some input: In Cho, I. K., & Kreps, D. M. (1987). Signaling games and stable equilibria. The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 179-221, Banks & Sobel's Divine (and Universally Divine) equilibrium concepts are presented in Section IV.4 as a stand-alone concept. On the other hand Grossman & Perry's Perfect Sequential Equilibrium concept is just mentioned in Section IV.5 which has the title "Never a weak best response". In the Banks, J. S., & Sobel, J. (1987). Equilibrium selection in signaling games. Econometrica, 647-661. paper on Divine Equilibrium, page 654 (near the end of Section 3), we read "(...) This condition is more restrictive than universal divinity because (...)" , "this condition" being "never a weak best response". So it appears that Perfect Sequential Equilibrium (PSE) is a stronger equilibrium filtering criterion than Divine Equilibrium. This accords with Theorem 2 of Banks & Sobel : Every signaling game has a divine equilibrium to be contrasted with Section 4. of the Grossman, S. J., & Perry, M. (1986). Perfect sequential equilibrium. Journal of economic theory, 39(1), 97-119. paper introducing PSE, where they show by means of an example that a Perfect Sequential Equilibrium may fail to exit. A paper that applies both concepts is Beggs, A. W. (1992). The licensing of patents under asymmetric information. International Journal of Industrial Organization, 10(2), 171-191.. In Section 3.2 a result is derived by an appeal to the PSE concept. Then the authors note that, given an additional condition, they could obtain the same result by an appeal to Divinity. This agains shows that PSE, when it exists, is stronger than Divine equilibrium. Here too an example is offered for a case when the PSE does not exist. 

I won't replicate the model -interested readers should read the link the OP provides. Acemoglu's argument as to when a high relative supply of skilled labor will lead to skill-biased technological change is laid out in page 13 (below eq. $(18)$), it includes the all-important condition eq. $(19)$ and ends in the middle of page 14. Here the author explains what must hold in order to observe this phenomenon. Then at the the bottom of page 18 the author writes 

As regards the induction/deduction division, economics uses both, and they usually start by some induction followed by mathematizing it and then using deduction. In the older days, economists were based more on their own personal experience and observation as to how people behave economically. Just browse any classic economics book from the 18th, 19th and even pre-war 20th century and this becomes obvious. They then embarked on lengthy verbal arguments to connect these instances of experience (in the modern era this approach has partly survived, but formalized into the "representative agent" analytical framework). In modern days, both stages have changed: At least for fundamental advances, what can be detected as long-term trend is that solid empirical evidence (being statistical or other), that can claim some generality, has become a required springboard for induction and a new theoretical economic model. Just one example of a seminal such paper, Aiyagari, S.R. (1994). Uninsured idiosyncratic risk and aggregate saving. The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 109(3): pp.659-684. is a paper where the author packs considerable statistical evidence and theoretical and empirical references in two pages before presenting his model of (what the paper title says), as a way of validating his approach. The second stage has become mainly mathematical rather than verbal: one lets its model roll and see what results it will produce (this is the deduction step). This synthetic approach is necessitated because social phenomena do not have the repeatability observed in the natural world (although I would dare to say that there are many aspects of economic behavior that have remained virtually unchanged for at least all written history, and around the globe). Of course since nowadays science is produced in an industrialized way, a million economics papers out there are purely works on existing theoretical frameworks, so this strand is pure deduction. As regards the verificationism/falsificationism contrast, it appears that the OP uses the words in a rather relaxed manner, away from their stern meaning and the philosophical schools behind them. In that sense then, yes, economics looks for "adequate representations of reality", i.e. it sides with "verificationism": an inside joke is that "no economic theory was ever abandoned because it did not conform with the data"... For such matters, Mark Blaug's inside polemic The methodology of economics: Or, how economists explain has not lost its bite. The helpful comment below suggested also looking at abductive inference for how economists go methodologically about understanding the world. 

In Babcock, B. A., Choi, E. K., & Feinerman, E. (1993). Risk and probability premiums for CARA utility functions. Journal of Agricultural and Resource Economics, 17-24. (downloadable) we find the following table (the first column is the coefficient of absolute risk aversion) 

This case can be used as a fine example of factual research, economic theory and applied econometrics. FACTUAL RESEARCH Since the authors examine a specific real-world case, the actual facts can help to establish a plausible causal sequence. For example: was there a rush in the numbers of elephants killed, in response to which authorities announced and implemented a more aggressive and effective seizure policy? Or, although the numbers of elephants killed remained relatively stable per period, but, the authorities, eventually yielded to political pressure and implemented this more aggressive and effective seizure policy? Presumably, there are data and information to conclude on the above. Assume that it is the second situation. Then... ECONOMIC THEORY Argue that "Economic Theory tells us that..." and lay out the theoretical argument that the OP described in his question. Then APPLIED ECONOMETRICS Estimate the relationship between the magnitudes of interest, in order to check whether the theoretical argument is consistent with the available data. Here, one should control for other factors, for example as @denesp writes, was there a rush of unemployment in other sectors of the economy that could have contributed to labor turning for work to the black market for ivory? Illegal goods are very interesting, because supply deviates from production by the amount of goods confiscated prior to reaching the market. As long as the demand is there, increased confiscations will tend to increase production also, which tends in turn to offset the intended result of the seizure policy. VARIANT Assume now that the record shows that first we had an increase in the numbers of elephants killed, and then the authorities responded with increased seizures. Then one should establish first the likely reasons for the initial increase in production/supply. Are there indications that demand shifted? Are there indications that supply increased because of unemployment in other sectors? Assume that it was unemployment that pushed people to this activity, and that there is no indications that demand shifted. Then economic theory would predict that price should tend to initially fall. Then the authorities stepped in harder, and mitigated the increased supply, pushing the price back up. But if it was demand that originally shifted, then we should observe an initial rise in price, then an increase in production and a tendency for the price to fall, and then the effect from the harder seizure policy. Hopefully, since things in the real world do not happen all at once, there could be indications in the data on these price movements.
