The word "utility" is in brackets in the body of your question, so I am not sure if it means that you prefer or that you only want utility maximization problems. Anyway, here is an optimization problem that is not about utility. Suppose a company produces output $y$ using inputs $x_1$ and $x_2$. The technology used is described by the concave production function $f(x_1,x_2)$. (For example $\sqrt{x_1x_2}$.) The company wishes to minimize its costs, that is given the input prices $w_1$ and $w_2$ it wishes to produce $y$ units as cheaply as possible. The optimization problem is \begin{align*} \min_{x_1,x_2} \ & w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 \\ \\ \mbox{s.t. } & f(x_1,x_2) = y \\ \\ & x_1,x_2 \geq 0. \end{align*} Assuming the solution is an interior solution, that is $x_1^*, x_2^* > 0$, the Lagrange-multiplier of the production function's condition has a rather nice economic meaning. It is the marginal cost of production. If you insist on three or more variables, you can easily adjust the number of inputs, e.g. $f(x_1,x_2,x_3) = \sqrt[4]{x_1x_2x_3}$. 

Rather than deprive you of the joy of solving your own problem, I will show how one can also use Brouwer's theorem to show that the function $f:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ $$ f(x) = \frac{33+x}{16+x^4} $$ has a fixed point, even though its range is not compact. Note that $f(1) = 2$ and $f(2) = 35/32$. As $f$ is monotonically decreasing over $[1,2]$, this also means that $f([1,2]) \subset [1,2]$. Also, $[1,2]$ is compact and $f$ is continuous over this set. So $f: [1,2] \to [1,2]$ will have a fixed point by Brouwer's fixed point theorem. Similar tricks are used in game theory and general equilibrium theory. By showing that the optimal decisions by some players cannot possibly be outside of some boundaries one can frequently create a compact space over which fixed point theorems are applicable. 

The functions and their variables are different, so there is no "inflection" or flipping. The utility function $u$ which maps from the space of goods $X$ to $\mathbb{R}$ is convex and quasiconcave. The indirect utility function $v$ which maps from the space of prices to $\mathbb{R}$ is quasiconvex. Intuitively: $u$: If you average two consumption bundles your utility is not lower than the average of the utility of the two bundles. Rather than eating just meat one day and just vegetables the other day you prefer to mix these everyday. $v$: If the price vector is $p$ one day and $p'$ the other day you may be better off than if it was $\frac{p + p'}{2}$ every day. It is easy to check that anything you can buy under the second price regime you can also buy under the first. However there might be consumption bundles that you can only buy under the first price regime. 

But perhaps this is not always the case. The price might have been so high that you would not have been willing to bid above it. In fact it might have been so high that the no one but the highest bidder would have given that bid. Knowing this the highest bidder could decrease his bid. In fact in English auctions (non-silent rising bid auctions) the final price is the second highest valuation of the unique good. In the auction you describe (a sealed bid first price auction) the final price is usually somewhat random based on what people believe about each others valuations and each others bidding strategies. It can happen that the final price is higher than it would have been in an English auction because one of the bidders overvalued what his competition would be willing to pay. So the English auction is not clearly advantegous. It has been shown that given some rather strict conditions the English auction and the sealed bid first price auction have the same expected yield for the auctioner. This is known as the "Revenue Equivalence Theorem". In practice it is somewhat agreed upon that in rising price auctions bidders experience something called 'auction fever'. Basically being outbid encourages them to raise their own bid. This is true even if the auction was designed in such a way that revealing the true highest valuation by all bidders would be an equilibrium move. (Auction by proxy, the auction system eBay and several other sites use is such an auction type.) So it seems that in practice you might be right and rising price auctions might be better in expected value for the seller. This is just speculation but in your case you I think you might merely be experiencing remorse because you have undervalued your competitor's bid. I have been there :) (By the way this could encourage you to overbid on your next silent auction, to the benefit of the seller. Such overbidding might give him higher than English auction payoffs. Again, which system is better is not always clear.) 

This question seems analogous to "if I think the word infinity, does my head explode?" The answer is no. Infinity is an abstraction. You do not have to accept a piece of paper promising infinity. I would even hesitate to accept an incredibly large finite bill. On tricky countries buying the world: You do not buy foreign things in your own currency, first you purchase foreign currency with your currency and then you buy the foreign goods with foreign currency. Printing excessive amounts of money is not only inflationary, it also deteriorates the exchange rate of your currency to other currencies. The most your currency has to offer is being able to buy everything in your country. The total value of your currency cannot exceed this. Hence others are unlikely to trade more (e.g. the world) for it. 

Which means a stamp had to bought each month at 1% of the face value of the scrip and pasted on the back of the scrip to make it valid. You are correct to point out that this incentivizes spending just like an inflationary environment. 

I think it is important to note that $MRS(x,y)$ is a function. There is exactly one indifference curve passing through $(x,y)$. $MRS(x,y)$ shows the steepness of this curve at point $(x,y)$. Then $\frac{\partial MRS(x,y)}{\partial \alpha}$ would show how much steeper the indifference curve passing through $(x,y)$ gets at this point if you change the parameter $\alpha$. As YM'fr already stated in his answer, the interpretation of this is how the marginal substition rate (the rate at which she would be willing to trade) of a consumer in possesion of the goods package $(x,y)$ would change. 

If one of the goods is not beneficial and the other is then the slope of the indifference curve will be positive and hence the MRS negative. This is becuase $$ MRS(x,y) = - \frac{MU_x(x,y)}{MU_y(x,y)}, $$ and if $x$ is beneficial then its marginal utility, $MU_x(x,y)$ is positive, whereas if $y$ is not beneficial then its marginal utility will be non-positive. (Zero if it is a neutral good.) As @Oliv stated this has nothing to do with convexity. An example: Let (y,t) denote the amount of money you have and the time it takes for you to get to work/school. You probably enjoy having as much money as possible. Because the same thing goes for free time you probably want to minimize the length of your commute. Two utility functions that could represent your preferences: $$ U_1(y,t) = y^2 - t \hskip 20pt U_2(y,t) = \sqrt{y} - t. $$ Money is beneficial in both of these and travel time is not. But one represents convex preferences and the other concave.
