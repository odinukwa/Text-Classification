Back when I was training at home, I would do super sets for chest training, which are necessary to gain any type of results, given the absence of weights, I would do normal push ups on the flat with the hands wider then your shoulder, otherwise your triceps will come into play, followed by push ups with my feet on a chair and followed by push ups with my feet at the bottom of the stairs and the hands on the fourth of fifth step upward, all of this for a total of 5 sets of 8 reps per stance, for a total of 24 reps each set. This will train the lower, middle and upper chest muscles, simulating the different incline benches you would have in the gym. You can always then get someone to push on your back for added resistance. Regards, 

I just would like to point out that cardiovascular stamina can be achieved in many ways, not just with cardio or aerobic exercise. In this case, as you want to retain the muscle you have and continue to lose some fat, I can suggest that you start to train with clean and jerk. When I was training with the British team, we would start with an empty Olympic bar to warm up with 2 sets of 40 reps. Then you will increase the weight by 10kg at the time for as many reps as possible, and continue till you reach the maximum weight you can lift over your head for a total of about 10 sets. I can guarantee that your cardiovascular stamina and inner strength will raise, do this every other day. At the beginning you will notice that it is a lot more taxing then other aerobic workouts, as it combines the resistance with the explosive action necessary to lift the weight over your head from the ground, if you are not familiar with this, there are plenty of videos that can show you how, but it would be better if you get an instructor to show you, as the technique for this exercise is imperative that it is very good. If you use this training a few times a week, you will also notice that when you do conventional bodybuilding lifting, it will be easier and probably will be able to lift more, as this is a training that increase strength more then bodybuilding which normally is used for size. 

When I was bench pressing for competition, it was well known that we needed to keep the feet on the ground and the back arched to exert maximum force, but we have special weightlifter suits that keep our body very compact, a bit like a lifting belt would. But when you lift for training reasons, the back should not be arched, as this would not allow for the best isolation of the chest muscle and could cause lower back pain. If you try it, you will notice that with your feet on the bench or your knees over your chest, you will be able to lift less then with your feet on the ground, but the isolation is better and you will feel the lift a lot more, that is a qualitative lift. When you are then able to raise the amount of weight you lift, in comparison with another person that does it with his feet on the ground, should you put your feet on the ground like them, you can lift more or with less effort.

If you want to achieve what you have stated in your question, you need to train more like a weightlifter then a bodybuilder. Weightlifters train for inner strength first, by keeping set and reps down with maximum weight load, as size it is not the main goal. If you try to do this, you need to train 3 times a week, as you will need a lot of recovery time. This is because when you will workout, you will need to keep the intensity up as well, meaning no more then 1 minute between sets. Also because the majority of the exercises should be multi joint, like clean and jerk, squats and high pulls, with these exercises alone you will also get the cardiovascular workout you need to keep lean. I am not sure what is "heavy" for you, but for example, I WOULD do a training session like this: Starting with 1 set of squat with empty Olympic bar of 40 reps. Then 4 sets of reps to failure with 100kg, 120, 130, 140, 150, even if it is just one rep you can do. Then clean a jerk by choosing a weight that you can lift over your head only one or 2 times for 4 sets. Then high pulls with a weight you can do 1 or 2 reps with for 4 sets. If after this you still have energy, you can do some arms workout, more reps and light weight, it all should not take more then 1 hour. We are all different, but over the years of training with weightlifter at competition level and bodybuilder, I have learned that there are certain protocols of training that never dies, because they have been proven to be the one that create the best response within people in general, even if at times they can get you bit bored. Anyway, you can see that what I am suggesting is very well documented on the net, you just need to look at a weightlifter body and a bodybuilder one, to see that the first normally has the body that you are saying you want. Food wise, you will need to have a good storage of energy before you start, after a few hours from finishing the training and during the rest days, it is when you need to get the protein and vitamins in. 

In one of you point, you mentioned varicose veins. Over many years in the gym, I have seen many people having issues with varicose or spider veins. The only thing that seemed to work, regardless of what their doctor told them is exercise, which you already do, and a constant long term use of vitamin C. Make sure that you do not buy any supplement that have a large amount of "ascorbic acid", because that it is not really vitamin C, it is just a small component and not the best component, it is just the outer layer of the vitamin. The best foods with the highest content to consume for vitamin C are Kiwi, Papaya and Peppers, Peppers are better if you do not want to eat too much sugars coming from the fruit. 

I have a friend that it is going through something similar, I have been training him long time ago and now he cannot do what he could do before with symptoms like yours, that it does not mean that you have the same, but I would rule this out, given the history of blood tests with no results, you can ask the doctor to do a different check. Got him tested for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome or Fibromyalgia, if you experience fatigue and other flu-like symptoms every time after exercise, even if it is only mild, then this may be an indication of a more serious health concern such as Fibromyalgia or Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. Persistent symptoms like this should be checked by a doctor. Try not to be frustrated with the doctor because there is no blood test for either condition and the symptom picture is extremely complex and varies from person to person. You may be asked about your emotional wellbeing, have your thyroid checked, creatinine, urea, iron levels, liver and a haematological profile taken and have to answer a great many questions about how long, how often and how widespread before a diagnosis is made. Some people feel the labels CFS or fibromyalgia are slapped on after everything else has been eliminated and to an extent that is true but there are more everyday causes of many of the symptoms, and it is logical to look at these first. You can have some symptoms and not others, but in general the Symptoms that apply only to chronic fatigue syndrome can be: Knotted muscles are tender to the touch but donâ€™t necessarily cause shooting pains. Sore throat, and swelling of the lymph glands but without infection, depression, irritability and panic attacks, extreme crashes in energy, recovery from exercise that takes many days to several weeks, palpitations where no cardiac condition is present and a definite timeframe from which all this began. Regards, 

It is very good that you do a full body workout, I am doing that and it works well. To maximize each workout, especially if someone have been doing this for a while and the body is somewhat used to the routine, you need to train every other day. This give you plenty of time to recover, which is needed, as you grow when you rest and sleep, especially for people that train naturally, with no added chemicals. The days you train, you need to maximize the exercises to the maximum weight that allows you to do between 6 and 8 reps, for a maximum of 5 sets per exercise, and you should do no more then 2 exercises per body part. This mean that you need to choose the exercises that maximise growth, at this stage, and not concentration exercises that defines. For example for chest you should use bench press and dips or flys, if you are on your own with no one to spot you, you can use the smith machine for security and to help to keep a stricter form. T-bar for the back and pulls up or lat pull down are good. Military press for the shoulder front and back with smith machine or bar, or with dumbells is good. Triceps pulldown or extensions with tricep dips on a superset basis with biceps barbell curl and dumbbell screw curls, keeps the blood in the same area and maximise pump. Legs you do last, as they would take up a lot of energy at the beginning, if you can use a leg press or smith machine for squat is better, no need for leg extension at the moment. If you maintain a resting time between sets of about 30 seconds, you will be keeping the right intensity that stimulate growth and maximise growth hormone secretion. At this pace you should be able to do all of the body in about 1 hour, off course you will not have time to chat or looking at your mobile! To go with this, it is important that you look after your diet, but this is another subject, which to comment on, I would need to know when you train and what you do on a daily basis. Hope this help, but if you put this into practice, after only 2 weeks you will notice a different on the pump and other markers.
