The prevailing explanation for the existence of rate of interest (aka time-value of money) is the one thoroughly explained above by Alecos. My objection to this is that it analyses the phenomenon from a psychological perceptive, and not from a purely economical one. I will give Marx's arguments on the matter, as an alternative for you to consider. According to Marx, there is no such thing as "Natural Interest". There is nothing natural in it. The rate of interest is just an agreement made between money capitalists on one side (banks) and the industrial and commercial capitalists on the other (factory owners, merchants, etc.) and it varies depending on the competition between them. The theory behind this explanation, lies on Marx's central idea that profit is not made during product exchange, but during the production, by extracting the surplus value from the workers. So, how does a banker makes a profit? What is really happens, in simple words, is firstly he lends capital to the factory owner/merchant, then profit is produced via the production process and in the end profit is shared between the two. Thus, competition between the two different types of capitalists (relation between real capital/money in an society at a given time period), determines the rate of interest. Given these arguments, the answer to your question is that in a capitalistic society, there is indeed time-value of money, as there has to be rate of interest (credit system will always be essential for such a society to exist). However, in a non-capitalistic society, ex. in a socialist one, there can be banks to serve public needs, public sector projects & state-owned enterprises, but there won't be a rate of interest for that, thus the time-value of money disappears in such a society.

I guess that, if you have a rather limited understanding of economics, what you need is getting some intuitions. Also, in this first part, I only deal with commercial banks. Note however, that only commercial banks create money while central banks emit/issue money (more about this difference in the last part). But how does creation of money work, is this creation real in the physical sense ? Say I have a bike (money) and because I am not using it, I park it somewhere (commercial bank) someone can borrow it. However, if I need my bike, it must be where I left it. This is what the liquidity risk is about. In this case my bicycle is a conserved quantity, and the "parker" (banker) has a book, in which she writes that she has my bicycle: 

Thus the parker lends my bike and hopes that I am not about to come back to use it. But the borrower will also have to park the bike somewhere, because she will not use it permanently. And she parks it in the same parking. So the parker henceforth has what follows written in her book 

It would be tedious, not to say impossible, to empirically address your question without describing incomes' formation and circuit Indeed, what will be a real change for a given person, may be nominal for another depending on how their respective "dividends" inflate in parallel. To illustrate this need for such a description, let's consider, in the schematic and highly simplifying world you describe, the (as schematic) following closed economy -- incidentally the world economy is a closed econony: Say that the (only one) dividend-generating sector is equitably owned by "richs". Printing money as you suggest would at first directly increase poors' income. But will they keep this wealth for real over the long term? Put differently, will this increase be nominal or real? If they save it -- which they empirically don't --, chances are that they will get richer. But if they consume goods/services produced by the owned-by-rich sector whose supply stay constant, it will generate inflation, which in turn will make poor's income-increase be nominal. Where will then be this injected money? In richs' pockets. The government's (potentially infinite) solvency will just be transfered to richs... That being said, note that if quantitative easing is strong enough -- putting aside the discussion about bubbles since the present example is monosector --, the supply may increase and (generate jobs and) stimulate GDP with a growth rate higher than that of inflation: which means real growth... 

Source: Capital Volume II, Chapter 6: The Costs of Circulation, I. Genuine Costs of Circulation, III. Costs of Transportation My understanding of Marx's argument is the following: Transportation does not alter the quantity/quality of products significantly. But, products need to have a use-value in order to also have an exchange value. Thus, an orange for example produced in Spain has an exchange value in UK, only if it arrives in UK, so that it can be bought and consumed. So, transportation adds value to the products, and this is done (as with all products) partly from the labor value (transportation workers) and partly from the means of production (means of transportation: airplanes, ships, cars, trucks...). Since transportation adds value to the product, and since price is a mirror of value according to Marx, then we can say that transportation tends to increase the price of the product (which is a logical assumption on average). Regarding distance, I am not sure if that is explicitly mentioned, but again we can deduce from the previous that: bigger distance --> more transportation needed (given constant technological advancement in a period) --> more transportation labor needed + more transportation means of production --> more added value --> tendency for bigger price. 

EDIT: The time value of money in a capitalist society stems from the fact that a capital now can be invested to yield a larger capital later. Thus, it has a dynamic, a potential and there lies its time value. And that's its connection to the interest rate, as explained above. In a socialist society, that's not the case, as there is no private investment for profit. The "more is better" argument is debatable, as it lies on psychological reasoning. To what extend money for consumption now is better than money for consumption later in any kind of society can vary according to individual's preferences, views, current needs, economic security of a given society, etc. 

To go further But who is the first/primordial lender ? First of all, note that it is impossible to go further without clearing up the prevailing confusion regarding the two following terms: creation versus emission, since expressed as such, the two underlying notions are incompletely rendered for people. Strictly speaking creation in the economical sense means scriptural creation -- and this is the core subject of my answer --, while emission in the economical sense means ex nihilo creation of central bank money in the common sense. So, as you can see, these two terms are deceptive cognates of their everyday-life usage. Briefly (and still giving some intuitions), the first lender, historically, is a central-bank-like institution. And this institution, when printing money, appears as doing it ex nihilo. But in reality, these institutions turn human conceptions/psychology/beliefs into value. So saying that this generation of value is done ex nihilo is not correct strictly thinking. A (caricatured but not so far from reality) example is: On the one hand, assume the existence of a country whose name is Gouzlouk. This nation has no installed capital, no infrastructure, no army, no productive system, no school, no no. On the other hand, assume the existence of a country whose name is ASUK. This nation has a highly capitalized economic system, gold reserves, a powerful army, a highly productive system which produces things that everybody wants, and, specially, a currency that many other nations use as unit of value of their own monetary system. It is obvious that, if Gouzlouk nation prints money from what is said to be nothing, it will really be nihilo, since nobody in the world economy will buy what they produce, since they produce nothing, and even if they produce something and sell it in their own currency, nobody will wants to buy their production since they would first have to buy Gouzlouk's currency, which even if almost free, gives access to nothing desirable. A contrario, if ASUK nation prints money, it won't be ex nihilo at all ! And given that every nation in the world have their pockets full of ASUK's currency, which gives access to anything you want, they will have no interest to undermine it. Furthermore ASUK's army owns missiles everywhere and the nation is headed by a trigger man. 

Both classical and marxian schools assume the (cultivated) land to be means of production. The differentiation between land and shovel for example is that the land is considered natural resource (subject of labor) while the shovel is an instrument of labor. Subjects + instruments together = means of production. Owning the means of production is a necessary but not sufficient factor for a capitalist to exist. There is an umbrella of conditions and pre-conditions (i.e. ownership of labor-power, ownership of capital, capitalistic mode of production in society, advanced credit/banking system etc. ) that need to occur. For example, big land owners in Medieval times were feudal lords but not capitalists, since capitalistic mode hadn't emerged yet. A small peasant who owns a small piece of land and uses it to feed his family nowadays or sells some part of the crops in the local market, is not a capitalist, since he lacks capital and doesn't have ownership of other labor but his own. PS. That was the analysis for the question, bearing in mind that we are talking about land used for farming. Using it for other purposes (ex. rent) needs a more elaborate analysis. 

It has nothing to do with new products in the market, nor with confusion of use-value and exchange-value. To make it a bit simpler: 1) Commodities in capitalism have a two-fold character. The use-value (they are useful products for the buyer to consume) and the exchange-value (they can be exchanged to another products in a given way). 2) The exchange-value of the product depends on the embodied labor of the product, which is named as Value by Marx. So in a sense, exchange-value = Value. 3) Products can only be compared in relation to one another. You cannot understand anything by saying ex. 2 apples = 2 apples. Thus, we reach to the Elementary Form: 20 yards of linen = 1 coat In this equation, linen plays the active role or Relative form and coat plays the passive role, or Equivalent form. In other terms, you define the Value of linen comparing it to the Value of coat. Now, here is the core of the analysis. Marx claims that since there is a comparison (20 linen=1 coat), there must be a common element to compare. That common element is not the use-value (linen is not the same as coat). It is the exchange-value, or Value, or the human labor embodied in the two products. In other words, this equation states that labor needed to develop 20 yards of linen is equal to labor needed to develop 1 coat (given constant technological advancement, resources, etc.) Use-value, on the other hand, just acts as a carrier of Value. The importance of this realization, is to understand the essence of exchange in capitalistic world and connect it to the money form (20 yards of linen = 1 coat = 100 Euros), and understand socio-economically how money was created and what does it really mean.
