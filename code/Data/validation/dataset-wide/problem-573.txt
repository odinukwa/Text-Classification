I took a punt and purchased a Mountain bike second hand, unseen (off our local equivalent to eBay). It turns out it is a much higher spec bike than expected - including a carbon frame. Until now I have used Thule 591 roof racks to carry my bike, which clamps the down tube. Can I carry a carbon bike using these racks, if not, what is the recommended way to carry it? 

Answering the question: To upgrade to 180mm from 160 you need a Post-Post 180mm adapter and a new disc. The adapters are widely available as 180 is probably the most common sized front disc on MTB's. I think the question that should have been asked is "My front disc is not working as well as I think it should, how can I make it better". As many say, its not size that counts.... (I could be wrong, maybe you just want to do the bicycle equivalent of stuffing a sock down the front of your pants, in which case, go for it, no need to read on) A bigger disc is a cheap way to make cheap crap brakes work better, but they are still cheap brakes, so manufacturers have sold us the idea that you need big disks because its cheaper to make big discs than good brakes. They then go on to sell the idea that by spending more money, for the same weight you get better brakes. If you have cheap crap brakes a better (although more expensive) option than a bigger disk is upgrade to better brakes. If you have good brakes then something is wrong if they are not performing well and you should address the performance problem (poor bedding in, contaminated pads etc). 

A great rule of thumb is "Dry lube for dry conditions, wet lube for wet conditions". A bit of surface rust on an otherwise well maintained cassette and chain is only a cosmetic problem. If this is a concern, clean the chain, lube with a wet lube, wipe dry. The trick is to 'over lube' the chain and then wipe off the excess. I might be tempted to leave wiping the chain for a day or two to let the lube migrate around the links. As far as the cassette, give it a light spray of WD40 after cleaning. Don't get too much on the chain as its not a lube and you don't want it displacing the lube you just put on. 

Most likely cause if the disc and pads are contaminated. What did you wash it with? Many cleaners leave a residue. Worst case the pads need replacing. The discs should be well cleaned before installing new pads - Use a solvent such as brake cleaner, methylated spirits or Isoprop alcohol, and rub the discs to be certain no contamination is left on them. Best case is a good clean of the discs solves the problem. If this does not work, remove the pads and clean with cleaner and re install and clean disk again. If this does not work there are tricks with pads such as burning, sanding etc that might help - I won't cover how to do it here as its well covered elsewhere. How far you go trying to restore contaminated pads is more a matter of how much time and effort is needed vs cost. Eventually (and quite early for me) patience runs out and as new pads are the guaranteed fix, its down to the LBS I go. 

Not entirely surprised you have problems refer here... According to this link, Cable Pull for a Campy 10 shifter is 2.8mm, dÃ©railleur ratio for a Campy is 1.5 (or 1.4 for old) Cassette sprocket pitch for SRam 9 is 4.35. So a single shift on the the 10speed is 2.8*1.5 = 4.2mm (ideal is 4.35). Over a 9 speeds that an error of 1.35mm, so when tuning, you will end up with about 0.7mm error on the outer cogs - i.e. it will never be able to be tuned perfectly, but when everything is new and shiny, will work surprisingly well. As things get less new and shiny, this error means tuning become more and more difficult. The fix would be installed a Campy 9 speed shifter or a 10 Speed cassette and chain. Edit: Another page on compatibility here lead me to This adapter (Shiftmate) or similar might be the answer you are looking for. They specifically list a Campy 10 shifter to Shimno 9 (Sram and Shitmano 9 speed are the same). 

I am going to combine the comments into an answer - feel free to improve. The main benefit is the larger circumference of the ratchet surface. This means for the same torque on the wheel, there is less total force on the ratchets holding the freewheel. It also means there is room for more pawls, meaning less force on each individual ratchet. This allows smaller ratchets and pawls, meaning you can have more of them, meaning even less force. Additionally smaller ratchets and pawls allow smaller angles before engagement of pawls locking the free hub - less slop when starting to pedal after free wheeling. The smaller angle before pawls engage also means the pedals have less time to accelerate - meaning the forces and wear and tear on the engaging pawls are lower. Having more pawls means the freewheel is more likely to operate if one fails to engage. Conversely, a smaller diameter ratchet would be able to support fewer pawls, which would have to be much stronger or likely to be less reliable and engage less quickly when pedaling is resumed after freewheeling 

Square taper cranks are easily damaged if they a ridden loose. You may find that the only fix is to replace the crank. If after tightening to the correct torque they continue to loosen, they must be replaced. Over tightening, while tempting, is not the correct solution and will lead to maintenace problems down the track. (Essentially someone will have to remove the crank for some reason, it will keep coming loose after that and eventually be replaced. The process of fixing will take several attempts as the presumption will be the crank is in good condition when it is not) Take the bike back to the the shop. As the crank has come loose again, ask them to replace it. If they refuse, be prepared to take your bike back every two weeks until they install new ones. Do not "fix" the bike yourself. The LBS might claim it was something you did that caused the problem. 

Tires will make a difference and are probably worth a try, along with light weight tubes. The bike will still be heavy, with heavy wheels and low quality components including bearings. Don't expect too much from a bike of that specification level. Upgrading the bike to a better MTB or road bike (depending on if you need a MTB) would make a much bigger difference. You can probably sell the bike you have and buy a used one more suited to your needs for less than upgrades will cost and would IMHO be a better way to approach this. 

Chances are the calipers are compatible with with something like BB3 pads. Problem is finding some will be more expensive than buying new calipers. You could look at pictures and 'take a punt' buying off the internet, or go to local bike shop that can match to your calipers with new pads - but that will cost at least twice as much. I suggest spending a bit more and upgrading to a known brand of caliper, so when it comes time to replace pads you don't need to go though the exercise again. 

The disc is the easy problem - as already suggest, brake cleaner, alcohol, methylated spirits all work well. An abrasive (scouring) household cleaner also works really well. The pads are another problem altogether as they absorb the oil. If you can afford it, by far the best solution is to replace them. If you want to try to save them you need to remove them from the brake and give them a really good clean. Put them in a container with solvent and let it soak in, then wipe off and sand/file the surface layer off - again, an abrasive cleaner can be used effectively. Some people suggest trying to burn the oil off - place on a metal tray in a safe place, a couple of drops of meths on the pad, and light it. 

When you sit on your bike, you put more weight on the rear wheel than the front (it's easy to use bathroom scales to see exactly how much). By distributing your cargo 60/40 to the front, you get a more even distribution of overall weight on the tires. This is good for several reasons. The tires (assuming same size) have the same load bearing ability, so having them evenly balanced is better - particularly on a heavily laden tourer. Also if you put to much weight to far back, there is no weight to hold the front down. This negatively affects cornering, inducing uncontrollable under steer, and also affects hill climbing. A tourer usually has an insanely low granny gear, which means it's possible to grind up very steep hills, provided the torque does not lift the front wheel. Pulling wheelies on a fully loaded tourer is something best avoided by all but the most skilled riders. These are only guidelines. Every rider and bike is different, so you should do what suits you. Don't be scared to experiment - even once you find a way to load that you like. If you don't try something different, you may never find that "better" way... Forgive me, I will go for the bonus points. Max Torque induced by Pedal Force on Chain = (Rider Weight * Crank Length) / Small Chainring Diameter. Torque on back wheel = (Force on Chain * Diameter of Largest Cassette gear ) / Wheel Diameter Torque to rotate bike = Wheel base * Weight on Front wheel. Crash === Torque to rotate bike > Torque on back wheel
