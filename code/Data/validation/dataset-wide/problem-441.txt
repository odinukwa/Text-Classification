Do any known poisons do this? In particular, I'm concerned about the "no gastrointestinal symptoms" part, as it seems that all the real-world poisons I've researched cause gastrointestinal disturbances when ingested. 

The legends of lycanthropes go back eons; while they have changed over time, a common modern expression of them is of an infected or cursed human that is given the power to transform into a wolf and/or a hybrid canid-humanoid form either willingly or when triggered by certain events (anger, full moon), in exchange for a more...primal and predatory mindset. While we know that shapeshifting requires magic, one possible interpretation of lycanthropy is of a permanent change to the "hybrid" canid-humanoid form upon infection: 

Einherjar is the world's finest AoG team ;) The idea of an airliner returning to service after a checkered past, if you will, isn't so crazy after all. Airliners are expensive enough assets with long enough lead times to obtain (2-3 years) that you seriously don't want to write one off if you can help it, especially if it's say a widebody jet, so the major airliner manufacturers have what are called Aircraft on Ground (AoG) repair teams that will pack up their tools, fly out to a stranded airplane (whether it dragged its tailfeathers halfway down 10,000' of runway then proceeded to belly into a mudflat or spindled itself up the rear pressure bulkhead on a fencepost), and fix it up to "like new" condition. A great example of this comes from the below quote, referring to Air France flight 187: 

Dissolving folks quickly is hard work Most acids aren't going to eat through you (or your average door) quickly -- while they denature proteins and dissolve metals, they don't have the oxidizing power to dissolve someone movie-style, and won't eat a doorknob faster than a drill bit. Even strong oxidizing acids can be sluggish by themselves under normal conditions. There are some oxidizing reagents, however, that are capable of reacting that vigorously, and aren't completely out of reach of a supervillain. Mostly, they're used to deal with nasty cleaning/etching jobs IRL, far beyond the reach of anything you can get at the hardware store. Note that green and gooey aren't going to show up here -- gooey doesn't help you much when trying to get a vigorous reaction going, and very few things can produce a green color without getting eaten up by the stuff doing the dissolving. Bubbly, however, certainly will. Piranha The term "piranha solution", or just "piranha" for short, has a very specific meaning to chemists -- it's a reagent produced by mixing laboratory sulfuric acid with 30% hydrogen peroxide. The partial in situ sulfuric acid peroxidation that happens combines with the ability of sulfuric acid itself to abstract water away from molecules and the ability of hydrogen peroxide to attack carbon-carbon structures by producing carbonyls, yielding rapid dissolution of whatever organic matter gets thrown its way. It is much less effective against metals though -- only about as effective as sulfuric acid by itself. Aqua regia The other famed dissolving acid of history is aqua regia, a mixture of concentrated nitric and hydrochloric acids. While less effective against organic matter (nitric acid will oxidize it, albeit with a bit of sluggishness due to stuff getting nitro groups tacked on first), it is wickedly effective against many metals, even normally corrosion-resistant ones, due to the ability to form stable chloride complexes that drive the oxidation of the metal far to the right. It's also the most colorful of the reagents mentioned here due to the nitrogen dioxide, nitrosyl chloride, and chlorine that forms when it decomposes. Perchloric acid Perchloric acid is special, even as far as acids go -- it can attack and dissolve most metals all by its lonesome and is far more acidic than any other commonly produced industrial acid (its acidity puts it in the "superacid" category -- no other large-industrial-scale acid can claim that). Its technical grade is relatively sedate, but when concentrated well beyond that and heated, it is one of the most violent single-component oxidizing acids known, reacting violently or even explosively with organic matter. Atop that, many perchlorate salts are powerful oxidizers and even explosives -- ammonium perchlorate is used industrially in pyrotechnics and solid propellants, and friskier perchlorates such as heavy metal salts and alkyl compounds are well known to blow up at the first cross look they receive. Chlorine Trifluoride The one thing in our rogue's gallery that isn't acidic (I left elemental fluorine off as it's a cryogenic liquefied gas for most transport) is actually perhaps the most brutal of them all: chlorine trifluoride. This is one of the few reagents that will completely consume someone, pretty much irrespective of what they're wearing, in a matter of seconds to minutes. It will also do things like burn its way viciously through things that have already had as many oxygens stuffed onto them as they will ever take, such as concrete, as is fitting for a strong fluorinating agent. It is a volatile liquid stored under its own vapor pressure though, but does come the closest to meeting your color criteria. 

Very thin and very strong wires strung horizontally at shoulder level. Relying on pile-up effect to efficiently behead first row using the push from behind. Several layers at various height to compensate for pile-up. Carbon nanotube wires could behead without the zombie even noticing, without the need of help from friends. 

It is very likely that there will be a dual-system. Something completely artificial, but precise, most likely a Real number (floating-point) like "stardate" (number of days, fractional; roughly equivalent to one wake/sleep cycle) or "unix" (number of seconds, fractional in recent incarnations; as a short period, close to a "least common" unit). In this things like months or years bear no meaning and probably would be dropped. Something local, bearing resemblance with the planet at hand; there days and longer units linked to seasons would be needed. Absolute precision is not a requirement, but long term stability is. 

All in all he has to devise a full language to speak to this magic entity and stimulate it to do what he needs. Surely not a simple feat. Even allowing for a long line of Magic researchers building knowledge piece after piece, difficulty is enormous and the search is never-ending because: 

Big Pharma would immediately "patent" the stuff, package it, dispense it in small drops at very high prices. You will need a proper prescription to get one. Someone will have to decide what potion is suitable for you. Business as usual. ... until Narcos take over. 

Actually it seems your idea is not new (see here). It seems someone seriously planned to raise hippos as cattle; plan was not actually pursued, but for other reasons, not difficulty of domestication. They are not things you'll use as horses, but that's not intended ;) AFAIK they are kept in many zoo and they are happily proliferating, given the chance. I do not think you can put them in some "intensive farm", but they will be willing to solve marshland excess vegetation problems you may have. In a few generations, butchering mercilessly the most unstable and allowing the more docile to mate, you should solve even irascibility problems. This should take a very reasonable amount of time (no more than 10 generations). 

Otherwise You can rely on superstition, after all no "taboo" was actually backed up by real threats. 

If by "English" you mean "US-English" (as most of the world do) then you should take into account fact it already is a very mangled and simplified language due to the sheer amount of people that talk it as "second tongue" even in the US. A couple of centuries of continuous immigration from the farthest corners of the world produced a language that is much simplified (with respect to the "original") and easy to use mainly in everyday exchanges, but lacks in depth. As an example: all Philosophical discussions are done using German words. The major anchor to keep a language fixed are the recorded fonts. Without such anchor languages drift quite easily (and fast!), especially if groups are small and with infrequent contacts. Some expressions lose completely their original meaning; the cited "oh God!" might have become a generic interjection with no link to the Almighty (and probably spelled as "oggod!"). This happens continuously in "live" languages and especially so with US-English which is open to all influences. One example also here: "placebo" original meaning ("I take the place of") has been forgotten to the point it acquired a "beneficial" role, so much so a new word was coined to express the "negative counterpart": "nocebo". In general, depending on the amount of book/video which survived apocalypse (and ability yo read/play them!), you may bet on a further loss of many words not representing something some aspect of the current life and birth of specific "slang" words to detail something important for survival (Inuit don't have a word for "green", but have more than 20 to represent different kinds of ice). Some words, now common, could become used just in fairy tales for kids. 

The answer to this question sits on the shelf at the BBEG's local hardware store. It's called d-CON. No, seriously. The second-generation superwarfarins (such as brodifacoum) are exactly the poison you seek -- they have a long half-life in the body (in the weeks to months range) due to being highly fat soluble, are capable of being quite insidiously lethal due to their mode of action, and can easily be antagonized by a steady diet of green vegetables (as said vegetables are high in vitamin K, which counteracts the effects of coumadins). However, if Joe gets out and reverts back to his fast-food-eating ways...he'll be in the hospital or worse. 

Golden colored tools are already a thing The native state of engineering TiN (Titanium Nitride) coatings is a bright golden color -- it is quite common to see high-speed machine tool bits that are coated this way for its anti-galling, anti-corrosion, and anti-wear properties. An example is the drill bit depicted below (pic from Binter on Wikipedia.DE): 

LCD and OLED displays, though, are inherently raster in nature by virtue of being assembled from discrete pixels. This means that a technological society that embraced native vector display wholesale would have a much tougher time migrating away from CRTs than we did, where most of our mass-market CRT usecases could be readily migrated to LCDs because the display model used was no different. 

X-linked recessive issues So-called "X-linked recessive disorders" are caused by a mutation in a gene on the X chromosome -- as a result, they are much more prevalent in men than women because even if the daughter gets a broken X chromosome from Mom, Dad provides a working one (provided he doesn't have the disorder himself), while the son is stuck with whatever Mom gives him for an X. In particular, a commonplace X-linked recessive mutation that has negative effects on fitness for combat (such as the classic example of haemophilia A and B, or some type of dystrophy or hemolytic disorder), while helping the men survive some other threat in order to reproduce (like how G6PD deficiency protects those with the mutation against malaria), would drive women (who are less likely to be affected) into combat due to many of the men simply being unable to fight well (or even at all). 

they are taken in to a research hospital for evaluation. What evaluations and tests would be performed on them? We can assume that our visitor: 

There are two reasonably-improvisable explosive materials that'd be useful in such an environment: ammonium nitrate/fuel oil aka ANFO (which is commonly known/understood in industry, but is considered a blasting compound as it isn't cap-sensitive, requiring a booster charge to set off) and urea nitrate (which is slightly harder to make and more sensitive than ANFO, but can be set off with a blasting cap). Of course, there's nothing wrong with using urea nitrate booster charges to set off an ANFO main charge. Detonators would be the main problem -- primary explosives/initiating compounds are much harder to make/more sensitive than even nitroglycerine (lead styphnate is extremely sensitive, mercuric fulminate requires handling mercury salts, and lead azide requires the preparation of some other azide salt, which is also quite toxic), and exploding bridgewire detonators aren't easy to reinvent or set off without the right machinery. You might be able to get away with a pyrotechnic ignitor (such as those used for airbags and model rocketry), though... 

Main difficulty is such methods are deeply ingrained in cellular metabolism; it is unclear what other effect they would have on overall building of complex organism as we are. Please note we have much less genes than phenotypic characteristics (by orders of magnitude), this means a single gene has effects on many areas (this is different, e.g. in arthropods); it is not possible to change a single trait in a complex vertebrate. 

From what I read in comments I see a bit of confusion, but I believe this setup can be made workable without resorting to magic. 

It doesn't matter what you chose, ratio will be 50% after one generation regardless (unless aliens do something really nasty like gender-related abortions). If this is not the answer You're looking for please specify better. Clarification For all vertebrates reproductive balance is 50/50, with no exceptions. Chicks are born evenly matched (so many would-be-rooters and the same number, on average, would-be-hens). Reason why you have "many hens, one rooster" is because we kill (and sell as meat) all males. In the wild males use several techniques to scare away or simply kill off competition. Exception is when it's needed a combined effort to give next generation better chance to survive; there you have stable couples (family, if you want). In our species spermatozoa (from males) are responsible for sex of newborn and our testicles produce exactly the same number of Y-bearing (male) spermatozoa as X-bearing(female) ones. Gametogenesis (Meiosis) guarantees that. If "aliens" want to "increase throughput" have a few options: 

It seems to me you are speaking about early medieval villages not particularly near to a town, but you don't state it clearly, so please feel free to correct my assumption. Basic assumptions I see in other answers simply do not hold true for medieval life. A few facts (concerning medieval (i.e.: 800-1400 AC), European villages, keeping in mind north, middle and south Europe were very different and, sometimes, life was very different just a few kilometers away): 

Here on Earth there are several Classes of animals which have a "sack" digesting system, but they tend to be fairly low on evolution scale (e.g. Coelenterates). These gastrointestinal systems are much simpler and less efficient than ours. OTOH it would be quite easy to devise an animal whose excreting orifice is quite near to mouth, perhaps because the whole body is encased in some kind of bone armor. with just one opening. The "pellets" is not really a problems, there are animals (mainly in very dry climate) e.g. some Australian parrots, that deliver some soft pellets, as dry as they could make them (can be picked up with your fingers without dirtying them) as their only escretion.
