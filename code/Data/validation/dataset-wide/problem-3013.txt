One way of looking at this is both ways. Early in the history of thermodynamics, folks had a hard time with the idea that all of the laws of physics were reversible, but it time seemed to have a direction anyway, only the Second Law of Thermodynamics seemed to be directional, and it was not very specific, and seemed kind of arbitrary. This is Loschmidt's paradox. In response, Botzmann, a major name in thermodynamics, proposed that time flows the direction it does only because we are falling away from a state of very high order (Later, we decided the reason for this state of very high order is the Big Bang, that all points in space were identical when they were all compressed into a single point, and time resulted when they began to differ.) So if we were in a more chaotic part of the universe, time would not flow one direction, but would flow the other way for a while, until things were too orderly, and then proceed as we are accustomed. If it oscillated often enough, we would not really get a direction to time at all. On the other hand "for a while" makes no sense where there is no direction to time. So there is some underlying aspect to time independent of how we might perceive it. While our time is an artifact of the distribution of entropy, there is still some component of linear order somewhere behind it. That linear order might not sequence things as we see them, and if time were not directional, we might perceive it as a spatial dimension instead. That is kind of Augustine's vision of divine time, that a divine being could get outside it and see all history laid out in one big tableau. Kant elaborated this better by saying time is just a form of our thinking, and that other beings might have ways of thinking that were not sequential. It also fits with certain ways of looking at relativity. So if our time is accidental, what is its purpose? The purpose seems to be to facilitate a sense of learning and development, to simplify life so that it can address individual problems in a sequential way. Hegel looked at this as the reason for physical existence. That some aspect of the bigger picture is assisted by this piecemeal, separated and sequential approach, instead of the more basic time-free reality, and we are charged with working out how this fits into the bigger picture. So we might be just fine without time, but only, in some sense, if we weren't us. 

He might say "Congenital blindness is not anyone's fault. It is a problem. It affects your life profoundly. That does not make it an ongoing illness that must be treated whether you like it or not." Blindness, could, in some society, constitute a limitation that removed responsibility from a person. But Western society does not see it that way. We retain responsibility and manage expectations around it. We know that this limitation still allows for responsibility. 'Madness' is a very similar problem. It limits the ability to handle certain problems of life that others find simple. But for 'madness' we do remove responsibility and limit rights. Most basically, he is suggesting the approach to these two things be more similar -- that there be no limitation that automatically deprives you of rights or pushes responsibility for you off onto others. If you have a kind of madness that means you are perpetually a child in some way -- that you cannot develop impulse control, that you cannot learn to read, etc. -- your life may then become somewhat intractable, and you may need the assistance of others. (Szasz himself did not refuse to help people, with his psychiatric training. He refused to participate in the mechanisms of mental hospitals, court orders, forced prescriptions, etc.) But the blind man may also need the assistance of others. In fact, at some point we all need the assistance of others. Just like the rest of us, at some defensible point, how that help works still has to be left for you to choose, and even to some degree for you to arrange. Historically, many people have preferred an independent death to having their rights removed. 

Everett's Many Worlds model is, in its own way, a form of radical constructivism. It implies that each individual has a timeline, and every timeline determines an entire universe, in which decisions about indeterminate events is resolved only for those moving along that timeline. So not only does my entire reality depend upon how I make sense of it, but hordes of different versions of me create whole dimensions of alternative ways of making sense of it. In a more classical framing, all of those worlds are not duplicates of each other with minor variations, but exist as matrices of details that are only partially determined until they meet an observer. Given that notion of a coherent observer collapsing undecided past events, a la Schrodinger's cat, who is to say that any of those decisions are made on their own before I personally do something that requires them to be decided? Basically, we can presume that no past event affecting me is truly determined before I understand it. Then not only are understanding and acting intertwined, but actual history is undecided until action meets understanding. This becomes bizarrely solipsistic unless one also accepts some notion of intersubjectity, where my understanding of your existence, and your understanding of the past then presses me to share a partial understanding of the past, so that we agree on the vast majority of these past events. That is best captured, in my opinion, in something like Leibniz notion of monads. Shared reality consists of feedback loops between your subjective realities and mine. Each of our subjective realities is projected onto each other's and we accept partial versions of each of our associates' subjective worlds and mediate a position of our own. Whitehead's systematization in "Science and the Modern World" is largely a resurrection of Leibniz in reaction to the theories of relativity and quantum mechanics and the feelings of relativism in a matrix of overwhelming interdependence that dominate modern life. One way of reading this kind of thing is as a pure idealism, but an alternative is as radical constructivism with a strong form of intersubjectivity. 

Modern science pursues the data, and is pushed forward by observations of gaps between theory and observation. So it seems to me that modern science is powerless relative to teleological concerns, not opposed to them. What teleological explanations generally contradict is multiculturalism. And the author may see modern science as the shared ground for a multicultural society. So there is a perceived gap. But it is only apparent. The real problem is that one cannot argue the purpose of an institution without an agreed goal, and far too often our goals are determined by past Christian culture, which we do not want to allow to continue to exclude the broader range of current culture. U.S. hospitals, for instance, are a schizophrenic compromise. They have a Christian teleological basis, as most are founded by Roman Catholic orders, other churches, or ethnic protection organizations. But they have a modern Capitalist means of support. Without the embedding that determined their form, neither approach can be pursued logically. We have a system where the poor both cannot pay and cannot be turned away, and where the rich and the working class both pay the same, until the latter become poor. So overhead costs skyrocket and the system becomes complex, internally conflicted, and wasteful. We have tried to take an institution and burden it with inconsistent teleological and economic goals. We cannot leave them as strictly religious institutions, because it seems exclusionary, nor can we integrate them as normal secular institutions, because we traditionally think of health as a divine gift or a community obligation. Education has the same problem. To what degree is education about proper behavior. In that case, who gets to define proper behavior. Can it include fitting into one's sex role, or meeting other obligations that tradition and religion suggest, but capitalism and civic duty do not require? Can you then pay for that with public money? Science can contribute nothing to this, and creates none of this conflict. But it is symbolic of the place where we expect culture-agnostic solutions to come from. We need another one. 

Based on this logic, Agile processes generally lack recourse to appeal. Decisions are made, and those making them negotiate with whomever they need to involve. Mistakes are corrected, and decisions may be reversed once there is more data, but work proceeds until that call. Even if the reversal makes the intervening work a complete waste, a policy of appeals routinely creates enough waste that it is never worthwhile, by creating either constant delay or hesitation due to fear of reprisal. Of course these kind of processes do not take place in life-or-death situations, and they tend not to involve single acts that can have huge costs. They originate on car assembly lines and predominated in software engineering. But production or maintenance work is the normal course of human activity, and is free of momentous decision points like those faced by courts, or in diplomatic interactions. Most normal human activity does not need to be modeled on the State. One might argue that if a decision is critical in a given range of ways: extremely costly, threatening life, completely irreversible, etc. then a critical fraction of those affected should be involved in making it, and the easiest way to involve that critical fraction is via chosen representatives of larger segments of the group. But most human associations very seldom make this kind of critical decision, or if they do, make them seldom enough they can be addressed via direct democracy or group consensus. 

As I see it, the relationship between Dialectic and Logical Positivism is one of complementarity. Kuhn analyzes science into periods of normal science interrupted by revolutions. As I see it science never actually totally focusses on either puzzle-solving or the generation of new approaches, but cannot make progress without the two working together. The distinction between the two different periods seems to me to be more of a matter of degree than of kind. Dialectic largely generates new ways of looking at things out of old ones. Logical Positivism allows primarily the kinds of resolution that are essential to normal science. Neither can really play the role of the other, as much as the advocates of each might imagine they have a complete solution. It seems to me that the only sustainable way forward is to slide back and forth between reliance on these two processes. 

The 'everything' does not cancel out in the math, as it does in the other cases. But I cannot reduce that to the right form. We cannot quantify over everything in a positive way by reference to a property. Instead, we have to capture the main point in one statement, 

The first of these increases our ability to be educated. People give a few examples and we are meant to intuit a rule. (This is discussed as 'over-imitation' in the first reference.) So child rearing and work coordination are better. But it is not reasonable to look at nature-in-the-raw in this way, we need to back away very far from the idea that nature is actively teaching us the truth, in order to really learn from it. The second of these allows us to take risks that might benefit our group, but may be unwise for us individually. We overestimate our chances of success, which allows us to make fatal or otherwise costly errors, but still succeed genetically, because our family produces a number of copies of our genes in individuals that will all collectively share the results of success. If we were objective about normal situations, most of us would be too passive or risk-averse for the group as a whole to use us to its benefit. (We see this in that fact that the severely depressed are the best at estimating odds. But do not integrate well into a functional family or society.) The third allows us to take part wholeheartedly in groups' politics. We follow leadership that is not really there, taking direction from our peers that leads to collaboration and the formation of values. At the same time, we are motivated to look behind uniformity for (others') biases, or we would converge too quickly into rigid forms that serve only the leadership or the status-quo, and undercut the benefits of competition. We want to split our experience of rule-following into preferring agreement (the 'Social Exchange Heuristic') and avoiding being controlled (e.g. 'Commitment Skepticism'), so we lose sight of what ordinary, objective uniformity looks like. 

It seems to me that you must assume other human beings are sentient, or explain why you consistently wish to subvert your own efforts. If you are the source of all willful action, and we are zombies, then you need a good reason for your own self-destructiveness when we compete with you or resist your will. If we do not have goals of our own, why would our actions so consistently defy yours? Human action cannot be explained as a simple, mechanical process, or it would be much simpler -- it is goal directed and solves problems on purpose. Any reduction that would allow for us to be mere mechanisms, would reduce you to one as well. You might suppose you and Satan (or Entropy or whatever equivalent is convenient) are the only two sentient beings around, and we are agents of his, but then you would need a good reason why he would not simply compete with you directly. The level of detail he needs to maintain to keep all of the zombies in convincing personality traits is a complete waste of effort he could deploy more effectively. Assuming Satan is more independent of you than directly competitive does not help. If we are simply fragments of a single separate will, we are still separate from you, and will is not a uniform thing, so you might as well consider each of us, or each critical mass of us who seem to agree, a separate will, as to assume there is a single complex will involved. And even if I am an epiphenomenon of a deeper sentience, I embody sentience.
