The contractor needs to be able to initialize the connection himself, from his end. The recording needs to be in realtime. The video must be recorded at the server end. 

The first method (eliminate the source of the unavailable UNC network share) is always going to be the most efficient, as it guarantees an extremely quick response time. Thus, to fix this problem, I identified the source of the 30-second timeouts that were freezing my system: my NAS (Network Attached Storage) device. Never buy a cheap Netgear Stora NAS. For about two months, your computer will freeze randomly for 30 seconds. This will inevitably result in you telling the problem to your mates, followed by uncontrollable sobbing into your beer with frustration. 

I'm working with a contractor in a different country. We need some method to add his machine to the local network, using a point-to-point VPN. Unfortunately, Hamachi, while very easy to use, creates stability problems as he is using Windows 7. Whats the best method for us to use? 

I'm using Subversion and TortoiseSVN under Windows, connecting to a Linux webserver running svnserve. I have basic shell access to the Linux webserver. I have a non-encrypted link working, i.e. I can connect via TortoiseSVN to: svn://www.mysite.com/svn/myproject/ However, I need to convert this to an encrypted link, e.g.: svn+ssh://www.mysite.com/svn/myproject/ I can't get it working: any ideas? p.s. My client will accept nothing less than an encrypted link. Is it necessary? No. Do I need it? Unfortunately, yes. 

My machine is working 100% in every other way. InfiniDB (a MySQL compatible database) installs 100%, as does Visual Studio 2010, Microsoft SQL Server, etc, etc. Your advice on how to work around this? p.s. Here is the screen it got stuck on for 15 minutes until I killed the process: 

Solution: From: $URL$ "You can set the USB port status to Read only or Readable/Writable with Autorun Virus Remover ..." Conclusion: if you place your hard drive in an external hard drive case with a USB cable, you can ensure that its mounted as read only. According to Software Informer there is over 4,078 people with this utility installed on their computer as of 2009-07-07. Note of caution: when this utility is installed for the very first time it scans external hard drives. Suggest a thorough test flight on another external USB drive before committing your life to it. 

Install Google Apps on the domain. Set up SPF records, etc (read the docs). Now you can send mail freely through the Google SMTP mail servers. The mail will appear to originate from your domain (it will have the correct @mydomain.com). Of course, you could try to use the Google mail servers without installing Google Apps on your domain, but then Google would alter the "from" email address to be your gmail address. 

I am trying to set up a FTP server under Windows XP. Everything works fine with FireFox, but not with GetRight or IE. Any ideas on how I can get it working with IE and GetRight? System Setup I've tried both XLight and Gene6 FTP. On my router, I'm forwarding ports 30100 to 30110 to my local machine which is 192.168.1.64. I have configured the listening port to be 30100. I have configured the PASV port range to be 30101 to 30110. I have set up an anonymous FTP account. On another computer with an external internet connection (via WiFi to the next building), I can browse to ftp://91.195.X.X:30100/. Everything works fine with FireFox, but not with GetRight and IE. 

In my experience, FileZilla is not as robust as you would expect. Sure, its open source, but this doesn't necessarily mean that it is as polished as you would like. Little things such as the timeout could be set incorrectly. Suggest running Software Informer, and searching for "FTP server". It will list the most popular FTP servers in use, right now, by developers and users worldwide. Recommend: - Cerberus FTP Server with 4.5 stars and 325 users; - Gene6 FTP Server with 5 stars and 150 users; - GuildFTPd FTP Server Deamon with 5 stars and 23 users Avoid: - XLight as it seems to be unstable; - Titan as its unstable I really like Gene6 FTP Server. I have it running on my machine serving files right now, it works like a dream. 

Very rarely, our server runs low on RAM (and crashes) due to a certain rogue app that gobbles up all of the RAM. To guard against this happening again, is there any way to configure the built in Performance Monitor to send us a warning email if RAM crosses the 80% use threshold? 

Under Windows 8.1, if I format a drive to ReFS, then add a mirror using Disc Management, will it self heal if there is a bad sector on one of the drives? Or do I have to use Storage Spaces to take advantage of the self healing capabilities of ReFS? 

There are loads of videos on YouTube which describe how to do this, the one that I successfully used was Set up a Mirrored Array in Windows 7. Update It is possible to avoid this error, see the answer from @CyberPonk. 

It has quite a nice feature: if any files are different between a pair of directories, it changes the color of the icons. This allows you to instantly find any files that are different in the directory tree. 

I guess the subject says it all: would switching to Windows HPC Server 2008 R2 have any effect on average network latency ping times? Even if it shaved a few milliseconds off the time, I'd be happy - but is that realistic? 

Use a utility such as HDtune from www.hdtune.com. It allows you to run tests on drives to see their bulk transfer rate and seek time. I'm sure that there's a free version as well (have a hunt around for it). 

A possible solution would be to switch from using webfaction to using the Google Mail SMTP servers to send your mail. Since Google servers are reliable and free, you'll never have any problems. Here's what to do: 

I know that Webdrive offers a utility to map a drive letter to a secure FTP site. However, their software is pricey - and if you buy a license, it expires after one year so you can't use it any more! Thats just pure nastiness on their part. Any alternatives out there? 

Is it possible to run Windows Server 2008 R2 on Amazon EC2? Is it possible to upload your own images of operating systems to Amazon EC2? 

I'm running Windows Server 2008 x32 under VMware Workstation v6.5.2. VMwareUser.exe process crashes regularly, and uses 95% of CPU until its shut down manually. When I shut down VMwareUser, I suddenly lose the ability to copy/paste between the host and guest OS's (I can't live without this so I reboot). Any idea on how to prevent VMwareUser.exe crashing?
