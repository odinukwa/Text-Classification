Fat distribution in your body is entirely linked with your genetics. In general, for men, the last/hardest area to burn fat is located on the belly, and above the hips (side of the belly). But this can really differ from one guy to another, for example: 

Can you measure your body fat percentage? This is very important because weight alone does not indicate what your are losing/gaining. Regarding the food you eat, that seems good except for the rice at each dinner : that's way too much carbs in my opinion. To lose weight more effectively, you should be very careful at what you eat before sleeping. I only eat meat and vegetables at dinner, nothing else : no carbs (rice, pasta..), no desert. For the "cheat meals" : it's ok to have one from time to time, the important thing is that you must allow several days between them. In my experience I've seen that it is way worst to eat several extra meals in a row, than a big extra once in a while. Also, if possible, try having these cheat meals for lunch, avoid dinner. Regarding the salads you eat at lunch, do not use too much sauce, try avoiding bread (really hard, I know!). Finally, don't focus on having an exact amount of calories, you can have as many calories as you want if you eat lean meat for example. And if your goal is really to lose a lot of fat, you could try a high-protein diet, but you will have to stop doing cardio. This is a subject for debates I know, but there is the Dukan diet (I can give more info on that if needed) : I lost 15kg in 45 days ! 

It's OK to have a bigger squat than the other lifts, and it's one of the best exercises anyway. I've been doing 5x5 for more than a year now, and my lifts are exactly as PravinCG said : DL > SQ > BP > BR > OHP. But I did not follow exactly the plan : I added 5kg for the deadlift until I reached 160kg (instead of 2.5kg after 100kg), otherwise I guess my deadlift would be closer to my squat. Don't try to catch up, be humble, and don't hesitate to drop weight when you miss a few sessions. When I miss a week I drop the weights as many sessions I missed, it's just a way to make sure your form is perfect, because let's be honest : when you add 2.5kg to your best lift every time, at some point your form won't be as good as before. Even if my 5x5 curve is sometimes flat, I warm up heavier than a lot of guys in the gym, so don't worry about catching up : take your time, you'll be strong. 

If running at 50-60 deg F is ideal for a marathon in low humidity (RH < 60%) then what is the ideal temp for high humidity (RH > 60%) ? Is it the same? 

I like Avery Bartlett's plan, but if you want simple then try this. Run easy for 30 min every other day and for one hour on the weekend. No pace or distance. Skipping is fine but try not to skip the hour run, and dont try to make up fo missed runs. This is generally called based building and the goal is to get out and run before actually starting any kind of training program. That seems to fall in line with your approach too which is nice. Do this for a month and if you want more then first get your weekend long hour up to 2 hours then start a program. By the way most of the training programs are very similar, and consist of running hard 1-2 times a week, easy 2-3 times a week, and long 0-1 times a week (2.5-3 hours once a month minimum). 

I'll give this a try since no one has yet. Intervals are more commonly known and used whereas the progression run is not. An interval run has fixed amount of running medium to hard at a fixed effort or fixed pace broken up by fixed times of rest or easier efforts which can be short enough not to fully recover or long enough to recover but at an easier pace. A progression run is most similar to a ramp workout except in your case it slowly builds down. This workout is generally considered to be harder since you are continuously controlling both effort and pace while steadily increasing it to some point. A progression run can be run off the cliff effortwise but in the case of a treadmill I think this would be very dangerous. The key for a good ramp workout is picking a hard pace to peak at but slow enough to ensure you always stay in control and remain on the treadmill. Make sure you use the clip that will pull out the key and shut off the treadmill if you do a ramp workout. The good thing about ramp workouts or progression runs is that your running easy to medium efforts for 75% of the workout and med-hard for only 25%. For intervals its usually done at 50% or more with a hard effort, and repeats and/or sprints are about 10% hard or even less. Generally both methods are meant to change from one type of pace, HR zone, or effort to another in order to spend more time training at the harder, faster pace or incline. I think that is the goal you should focus on to get the most out of a treadmill training. The choice between the two comes down between simply a specific method of achieving your goals and a way to target your strengths. For example, if you lean liking long and easy workouts instead of short and fast then the ramp is better since there is less time spent at the harder effort and the transition between easy and hard is not as clear and easier to begin. I dont run on a treadmill much but I feel that it is an exercise that demands alot of control already, so I'd recommend ramp workouts for pace based running over intervals as long as your not pushing too hard. For inclines I dont think it matters as much. For the 1% incline rule there are some studies, at least one, that recommend this for making your running form on a treadmill closer to that off of it. Mixing it up is good if you can do it. In fact a interval session of slow high incline then fast and flat sounds like a great simulation for hills. I know of a few people who are pretty fast who use a treadmill to get through winter or to improve climbing ability. There was even an Olympian from Alaska who did most of his(?) training on a treadmill. 

So in total, you cycle/run 22km, plus 12 minutes on the elliptical (5km I guess). Is it too much? That depends on what your goals are. 

To answer your question: no, you don't necessarily need more upper body lifts. The philosophy of the program is to work harder your biggest muscles, hence the squats every session. However, it is a good idea to add some extra lifts if you still can after the three main ones, especially if you are doing the program for a long time, to have a better balance between all your muscles. 

Indeed, the answer is no. To be strong, you need to lift heavy weights, there is no way around that. You will never get strong if you limit yourself to light weights with high reps : that will just build up your endurance. For instance, marathon runners have a lot of endurance, but cannot compete with 100m athletes (which have a lot more power). In order to get yourself used to lift these 60 pounds, you must train eventually with 60 pounds, but of course you can reach this goal progressively. This is the same in all sports, and to compare again with athletism, a 100m runner will never train himself just for 80m and say "the last 20 meters are easy, no need to train for that". Once you reached 60 pounds, continue training at that weight to build endurance, your muscles will get used to it, and you won't shake anymore. 60 pounds is quite heavy for one arm (shoulder muscles mainly involved), keep in mind to train the other one! 

So the answer is that there is no universal area on your body that will reveal muscles, and the abs are in general the last part to show unfortunately! Legs and shoulders/arms tend to show quite quickly. Regarding the plank exercises you do, I doubt this is what makes your pants tight, are you sure you don't do additional legwork? Update Seeing your other post, if you talk about your waist getting wider, it is possible, and you might see the difference if your pants are really tight. But if you were talking about your thighs, planking will not make them bigger. 

If your shoulders need to catch up, I assume they are smaller than you would like them to be. The answer is : overhead press. This is the most (only?) useful exercise to get big shoulders, especially when you go heavy. Afterwards, if you seek for definition, the first step is to lower your body fat, and only after that you can proceed with isolation exercises, and you already know the three classical exercises:
