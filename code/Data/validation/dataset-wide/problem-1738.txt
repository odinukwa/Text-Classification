Yes, you can absolutely resize the existing partition. Just make sure that the new/resized partition starts from the same location. After that (and rebooting, so that Linux recognizes the new size of the in-use partition) run pvresize on the PV and after that vgs or vgdisplay should show more space. 

Aptitude has easier to remember commands: vs. . It is still a good idea to install so that you will be given information about the changes in the updated packages and the option to cancel the upgrade. 

which seems to suggest that the links will be created Most of the files also point to which states that udev and lvm2 will create devices for LVs in . The symlinks in seem to be the doing of . Device Mapper can be used without Logical Volume Manager for e.g. encryption with LUKS. 

I've created our own schemas, and am probably going to continue doing so when new needs pop up. I try to inherit from suitable RFC schemas, and often just have to pick some new attributes on top of when the RFC objectclass already has. Sometimes it's useful to define your own attributetypes to get naming to work. Like having device (already has serialNumber) + manufacturer, model, dateAcquired, warrantyEnds. 

Check out pGina. It doesn't have a Kerberos plugin, so you'll have to write one. Alternatively you can use OpenLDAP as a proxy and use the pGina LDAP plugin. 

In addition to ionice(1) rsync might be pushing blocks needed by mysql out from disk cache. You can patch rsync with fadvise support to avoid putting the stuff read by rsync into cache. 

I imagine that since actual server name and apparent email domain are different, sending mail is somehow considered open relay and actual message goes to void. Anyway, does anyone have an idea, how to fix discrepancies with name or how to fix SMTP server name? TNX! 

Following an acquisition we are switching from our local Exchange to an outside provider. I need to change account settings / create new profile so that users are able to access their new mailbox, and I hate the idea of doing it manually on every single client. I have tried quick and dirty solution with copying profile information from Registry on one computer to the other, hoping that I could fix user info later. Quite obviously, this didn't work: Outlook recognized the profile, I could select it at the application startup, but there the fun ends - the profile was corrupt. I couldn't change settings in Mail settings on Control panel, either. Didn't find any Group policy solution. Is there any application, script or other solution, that would help me save time commuting from one PC to the other and typing the same info over and over again? 

Further comments: The larger company is planning to implement seconnd solution internally for accountants and other "office" PCs. The infrastructure isn't there yet, but people with experience in this area will work on it. The smaller company would then also have about a third of its computers virtualized and put up on terminal server. 

Well, I found the solution that works perfectly. It uses a simple Logon script, so Avery Payne, one might say you were at least partially right :) Outlook (2003 and later, don't know about earlier versions) allows importing the profile info through PRF file. It is a plain text file, so you can write it from scratch, or preferably - export it from existing profile and edit as needed. I used the second variant. I downloaded Office Resource Kit - I was exporting PRF file from 2003 version, so I downloaded Outlook 2003 version (ORK.EXE, download it here). Installed it and got the Custom Installation Wizard, which enables you to export existing profile to PRF file. Needless to say, you first need to configure a working profile on the PC you're exporting from. After successful export, I edited the PRF file to lose unnecessary stuff and to generalize some settings with Windows variables, so that I get user specific info after the PRF file is imported: 

It all basically comes down to personal preference. Linux distributions are sort of like cars. All of them will get you to where you want to go, it's just that individually they look different, have different feels to them, and that some may require more maintenance than others. If it is your first go around, I would use Ubuntu. That being said, don't hesitate to check other distributions out. 

We are in the planning stages of deploying a SharePoint server that will be used for our organization's intranet. As part of the deployment, we are going to be centralizing all of the internal documents. As you can imagine, there is no standardization of the filenames for the internal documents that have already been created. What I would like to do is setup some form of standardization between the filenames now and those going forward to keep the intranet organized and uniform. What I am looking for is any resources or wisdom on how others have organized documents for their networks and on any best practices on general naming conventions that are/have been used. I realize that every deployment will be different, but I'm just looking for a general direction to be pointed in to get started. 

I find that a lot of the mailing lists at seclists.org have a lot of good information on security news, software vulnerabilities, and general security questions. **EDIT:**You may also want to check out this .opml file. It's a list of blogs and RSS feeds that Paul Asadoorian of PaulDotCom fame subscribes to. There quite a few feeds in there ranging on all sorts of topics from hacking to information security. 

Consider also the path for Offline mail caching... You might want to rename the file if you're using two profiles, so that one profile does not overwrite the cached emails of the second profile and vice versa: 

I also wanted to be sure that default user profiles won't get overwritten, so I changed corresponding settings to match: 

For details, read the Whitepaper: Configuring Outlook Profiles by Using a PRF File -> link I created a very simple logon script, almost too simple, actually. I could have checked whether the profile already exists and skip the procedure altogether, but sometimes quick and dirty works just as fine: 

I have a user in a domain who has access to multiple subfolders in multiple folders. His rights were defined pretty granularly. Now he's leaving the company but will continue to work for a firm as a contracted resource. I need to find all folders he had access to and revoke his permissions, then set him up with a different set of access permissions. Is there any tool (freeware, preferably) that lists all NTFS permissions for a given user? I've tried with AccessEnum from Sysinternals, but the list cannot be filtered by username and is useless for me. I've looked at CACLS, too, but as far as I can tell it displays permissions ordered by file, not by user. Any ideas? 

I have a standalone Win 2003 server with Windows Sharepoint Services (WSS3) running on it. I had to rename the server and I had bunch of problems resulting from this. Note that the server is not in AD environment. I fixed the problems with Sharepoint (directly related to a rename) by using steps 1 & 3 from this site (TNX) Nevertheless, there are still strange references to old server name all over the place: in registry, in Windows Internal database, in Sharepoint Central Administration... Most disturbing problem is that Sharepoint isn't able to send email notifications to participants. This is IMO due to the fact, that Simple Mail Transfer Protocol service is still "answering" with old server name. When I try to telnet locally to the mail server (SMTP), I get a response: 

Definitely get a whiteboard. You can use it to setup to do lists, draw up configurations to visualize the problem, and much more. It's also good for when you have a group discussing solutions to network problems. 

I'm in the process of setting up a MOSS 2007 (with IIS7 and Server 2008) intranet and am looking to find a way to prevent people from having to log in when they want to view the site. Ideally, I would like SharePoint to draw from the user's Active Directory account without having to enable guest access. Can anyone tell me how to do this or have any good resources that describe how to get this done? Just for the record--I have tried searching Google for the answers but apparently I'm not using the right terms to find what I need. 

I have been working on a project to map out my organization's network infrastructure. For the networking devices (we are a Cisco shop) I have been running the command to see how everything is connected and through which interface. I am noticing that our ASA is not showing up in the output of these commands (it is connected to a Cisco switch). I ran a command list via and CDP does not show up as an option. My question is this: is there a command similar to that will show to which devices the ASA is connected? 

UPDATE: Apparently the reinstall did not fix the issue. I researched the issue a bit more and found that disabling the background save may take care of it, but I haven't had a chance to try it yet. Does anyone else have any other ideas? 

we used to have Exchange on the SBS 2003 server inside our AD environment. Earlier this year we moved to outside Exchange provider but for the time being our local Exchange was still up&running and forwarding email to the new email accounts. Now the time has come to turn it off and I'm not quite sure what that means for SBS environment and how to proceed. Specifically, there is a local e-mail account associated with every user in the domain. Can I simply change the e-mail address of every user to their outside address, or should I first delete the Exchange account for every user + their Mailbox, and only then update the e-mail address? What do you suggest? How do I proceed? TNX! 

If it is possible you could try moving WinSXS to another partition as a workaround. To my knowledge there isn't any way to get rid of the contents of WinSXS. This cute little thingy is in the heart of Vista/Win2008 operation, so... I haven't heard anything better as moving it to another partition. Here's a link to a blog describing how to do it: Click I would suggest you do a full backup (even better: an image) of your entire C: partition before trying the procedure. Mind you that I tried this only on Vista, not on Win2008 Server. 

I would your suggestions for an effective solution for a person, who needs to access resources in two Windows domains and wants to use one computer. It's about our CEO, who has accepted a second position in another company. Accessing files and folders isn't big problem. The greatest challenge I see is that he wants to conveniently access Exchange accounts in both companies; he would like to send and receive mail in single Outlook if possible (two profiles?) There is also a challenge with calendars: he would like to have one calendar for all activities from both Exchange accounts. Creating a POP3 account for accessing second Exchange server is a last resort, because obviously there is a problem with scheduling meetings and other calendar related tasks. Forwarding and receiving all mail/tasks on primary Exchange server is inconvenient because simple replying to original sender is disabled; and also when manually changing the recepient, he will receive mail from the wrong address. We were considering Virtualisation, that is setting up an instance of virtual machine inside existing installation and then joining this virtual computer to a second domain. Then installing another MS Outlook. This would of course mean two different Outlook accounts, two different calendars, but would at least enable our CEO to access all information from a single laptop. Does anyone have any other idea? I know setting up two domains on a single computer is a no-go (without much hacking at least), but effective workarounds are appreciate. The thing I am looking here is high usage/efficiency/productivity, but also as elegant solution from the administration point of view. Thank you very much (if you managed to read this through, this is a good sign ^_^ ) 

I am working with an Enterprise level Access database. This database contains some basic data entry fields and buttons such as "Find," "Submit," "Clear," etc. We are, at the same time, updating our user's Microsoft Office Suites to the 2007 version. What we are now finding is that these form buttons are disappearing from the Access forms when using Access 2007. The strange this is that the buttons are still there function-wise and will appear after you click them. Has anyone encountered this or have any ideas on how to fix it? Edit The file the user is working on is an .ade. As far as I can tell the original database/forms were created in Access 2003. 

At our organization we use a series of shared Outlook calendars to schedule out our conference rooms. All domain users are setup as authors of these calenders. We are now running into a problem where the end user is either not checking/caring if a room already has an appointment assigned to the room for the period of time that they want to use it. So my question is this: Is there any way to prevent a user from scheduling an appointment or meeting on one of these calendars when there is already a preexisting one on it? We've already tried going into Options -> Resource Scheduling and checking "Automatically decline conflicting meeting requests," but this did not resolve the issue. 

I am running into an issue with a user whose Word document is somehow turning itself into Read-Only. The user is using Word 2003 and is accessing a document that is in a Server 2008 share. The document itself starts out as a normal, editable document (user has Full Control permissions), and the user is able to save and do the 'normal' things you would do to a document. However, after a couple of saves, the document turns to Read-Only (according to the title bar) even though the Read-Only attribute is not checked on the document's properties. Here is some additional information about the situation: *User has approximately 5-8 Word documents open at a time *User saves the document frequently (sometimes at a frequency of once per minute) *Once the document is closed it will open as a normal document if reopened *When the document does turn to Read-Only the user will do a "Save As" on the document and save it as FILENAME # where # is some increment of how many times this has happened (some documents are up to their 30th iteration) I understand that there is probably some room for user education here and that they could just be copying the RO document to a new one, closing and opening the RO doc, then copying all the information back. However, I would like to get to the route cause of the problem and try to stop it from happening in the first place.
