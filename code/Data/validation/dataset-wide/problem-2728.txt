The value of what is to be understood, whether it is a lesson, emotion, or bare fact. Its effectiveness in being understood by its intended audience. This is a tough one, in that I certainly appreciate a lot of music that I can't say I fully understand -- but perhaps the intent was for me to understand an emotion, or the effect of a certain sound or technique... Perhaps there were many intentions, and I have appreciated some but not others. I also know that much great art is written so that it will be misunderstood -- see "The Road Not Taken," or the passage with the "must haves" in "The Great Gatsby." I don't want to say that the quality of the art is a function of its impact, or how much its audience appreciates it. But I'm relatively satisfied with the way I've phrased this -- "its effectiveness in being understood by its intended audience." The uniqueness of that effort -- if I can have an audience understand a message that it could not otherwise easily understand, I may have accomplished something greater than if I had reiterated a thought that my audience already understood. Other factors. I really don't know. I think it's subjective at the end of the day, but if it's a function, it certainly isn't this simple. 

I think it might be instructive to reverse the premise; what would it be like if we assumed that humans were not corrupt, that is to say, actually were good and pure? If that were the case, there'd be no need for prescriptive ethics; morality would be self-enforcing. There'd be no conception of justice, as there would be no possibility of injustice. So, it seems to me that the notion that humans are not inherently good and pure (in an absolute sense) is a transcendental condition for any ethics. 

I'm not sure I agree with all of the assumptions underlying the question. First: why would it be amazing that "extremely complicated mathematics" would model the physical world? Wouldn't it be more amazing if only extremely simple mathematics were required? In fact, it would seem that given mathematics of sufficient complexity, one should be able to model anything; if one finds an object or system that resists modelling, one could easily add new axioms or arbitrary complexities until one finds a suitable result. Next: I'm having trouble understanding what the follow notion means, exactly: 

With many philosophers, the idea of reading their major works in chronological order is a good one; unfortunately, there are no reliable records as to the order of composition of the works of Plato and Aristotle (and Socrates, of course, left no writings), so you're completely out of luck in that regard. I'd suggest you begin with a topic that interests you, and work from there. And, if you have not read them before, I'd definitely suggest using a fair bit of secondary literature to help elucidate; there are many things at play in the works of Plato and Aristotle that may not be obvious on a casual reading. In addition, if you are new to this, I'd recommend starting with some shorter works, as the texts vary in length significantly. 

I personally define Art as any attempt to be understood. This reflects essentially all writing, rhetoric, painting, and the like. Some of those things involve sentiment, and some do not. An attempt to be understood which does not involve sentiment might include a passage in a math textbook, or a scientific paper (depending on what you consider sentiment to be, and what threshold level of it is relevant). Personally, I feel that expressing a mathematical truth in such a way that it can be understood is art, whether there is sentiment in it or not. Euler's Formula is a rather beautiful piece of art, I would say, and the derivations I have seen inspire me in much the same way as other art does. Your question hinges on how you define art. If you would like a cold mathematical textbook with no sentiment in it to qualify as art, as I do, the answer to your question is "no." If you would not like to consider that art, the answer seems to be "yes," but we still need a definition to see if we can falsify the premise. Try not to use the word "sentiment" in your definition. 

War is a political concept. War is something that a country does when its constitution says "this is the set of conditions under which a war happens." There might be things that don't fit that technical definition, but are practically similar to wars. You might call those wars, or "armed conflicts," or whatever... But the basic idea of war is just that it's a construct of how countries interact with one another. You might say that, for some countries, one individual leader has the authority to declare war, but that would only be as a function of the country's processes. You can ask whether it's my brain or heart that thinks (obviously, my brain), but if you're asking whether I'm thinking, yes, I am. So if a subset of the country is given authority to declare war on the country's behalf, the country has declared war. To be clear, in the United States, no one person can ever declare war. Only congress can declare war, and that involves many people. You might also ask whether I, as an ordinary citizen and civilian, am a party to that war, or am morally responsible for the war. But the country definitely declared the war, and went to war. 

What would it mean for someone to posit that "minds...are external to one's own mind"? Now, certainly, it is pretty uncontroversial for me to posit that your mind is external to my mind. But it doesn't appear that's what you're after. A physicalist holds that mental states are reducible to brain activity, but even still, these mental states are not experienced as brain activity. Put another way: even if one believes that the signified is ultimately reducible to physical states, this does not mean that it is identical to the signifier in its materiality. 

Some critics, such as Annie Dillard in her book Living By Fiction, argue that post-modernism (in literature) is actually just "contemporary modernism", and that there are no significant differences between them. Note that, for example, most of the points raised in the answer by @jbpjackson above would apply to Joyce's "Ulysses", which is sometimes categorized as the pinnacle of modernism. Also note that I am speaking strictly about "modernism" and "post-modernism" in their literary sense; the application of these terms in different domains (such as architecture or philosophy) is quite different. 

I have not read the book in question, but this seems like a peculiar idea-- how would one deal with children, who do not have the capacity to enter into a contract? And, presuming that one signs such a contract on one's 18th birthday, what happens to those who refuse to sign, or wish to negotiate a different contract? And, since the power differential between the state and the individual is so immense, to what extent could one argue that the contract was not coerced? 

I personally define art as any attempt to be understood. The value of art -- I suppose, the quality -- may be some function of 

You have to ask, given your understanding of sociology and given how well you've otherwise arranged society, what the likelihood is that the mass surveillance will be abused at the expense of those worst off. Then, you have to consider what the benefit will be to those worst off. Imagine this from such a perspective, and make the "selfish" choice. Personally, I feel that some version of effective encryption will, from this point forward, always be necessary, even in the most ideal society one can realistically imagine. Until we reach such an ideal society, I think the US Constitution provides pretty good approximations of the boundary line, and that the current extent of US surveillance is unconstitutional. I particularly feel that metadata is more sensitive than judges have yet understood. But, that's all me answering the question as a realist, and I think of Rawlsian philosophy as an idealistic one... I'm not sure how much more surveillance I would abide in a more ideal world, but I think it would be more. 

First of all: anything with properties necessarily "exists." The question is a specific type of existence -- in actuality, as opposed to as an idea only. The idea behind the ontological was that, if you could conceive of God, then he existed as an idea, and one of the properties that idea would have is that it also existed in actuality. It's a cute argument, but you really should be able to tell why it doesn't make sense; "existing" is not one of the parts of an idea, it's an idea, that's just what it is. It's as though you're talking about people; and you say that this person has the property of having blonde hair, and this person has the property of having dark skin, and this person has the property of being a television. No, people can't have that property. The same way ideas can't have the property of "existing" in actuality -- although they might refer to something that does. "Existing," isn't a property. If you want to talk about it as though it's a property, it isn't a regular property, like the ones that can be added and taken away from things -- you can't take an idea and turn it into a real thing, or a real thing and turn it into an idea (although you can make physical embodiments of ideas, and break them). It could not be added to or removed from a bundle of other properties. It would describe that bundle, and whether that bundle refers to a thing in reality, or to an idea. But it wouldn't be a part of that thing. Existence is not proper to me. I exist, and then everything else about me follows that in some inferior way. Maybe you want to call that a property, but it's clearly different from all the others. It seems to me different enough, at least, that it's not something that can be ascribed to an idea, such that God, if he can be conceived, can magically transubstantiate from an idea to a real thing. Alternatively, you can say that, when you're conceiving of that greater than which nothing can be conceived, and one of the properties you think of it having is that it exists, then great, you're thinking of it existing. But it's still just a thought -- it's just, you think of it as something that has the property of existing. You can't actually give it that property by conceiving of it as having that property. I could conceive of a Maserati that had the property of being in my driveway, if you want to call that a property, but I can't actually give the Maserati that property; I can only think of it as having that property. An idea can't have "existence" just given to it the way it can have "red" given to it. (Woah, this went a lot longer than I intended, sorry). 

What? You seem to be asking about a hypothetical situation in which people would be more willing to throw the switch (presumably,"more willing" meaning in this case "more willing than in the standard 'kill one to save five' scenario"). If that's what you are asking, the answer is trivial: if we alter the thought experiment to be 1000 people saved (or a million, or all of humanity) we find that increasing numbers of people are willing to throw the switch. Similarly, if we alter the experiment to be, instead of a person killed, a rat, or a watermelon, we'd find more people willing to throw the switch. Or, we can keep it a person, but change the result to be one of an injury instead of death. There are lots of ways we can rewrite the scenario to get different results. But if that's what you're asking, what does neuroscience have to do with anything? The way you framed the question seems to imply that neuroscientists have something relevant to say on the matter, but this is at odds with the content of the question. 

There is a legal notion, enshrined in law, called "theft of services" that covers this. The canonical example is sneaking into a movie theater; in this case, there is no physical item stolen, but rather, the provider of a service is deprived of the income he would normally receive for the enjoyment of said service. In the pre-internet days, this notion was most commonly applied in cases of unauthorized (and unpaid) connection to cable television service. In addition, music and literature are protected under law by copyright, which is (as the name indicates) a temporary monopoly on the right to copy an artifact granted to the creator. By downloading music one is making an authorized copy, and thus violating copyright as well.
