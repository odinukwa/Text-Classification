This one has a sheet metal dust shield fastened to the outer diameter -- the nut itself is inside of the inner flange of the shield. On the back side is a regular (though fairly thin) hex nut or (more often) a cylindrical body with two flats, sized to take a thin open-end wrench. (It should be noted that it's become common to refer to any nut that secures a bike bearing as a "cone nut", even though it may be securing a sealed bearing cartridge and hence lack the conical extension. This adds a lot to the confusion.) 

I once ran through some mathematical calculations, taking into consideration body weight, blood pressure, the area of the hand in contact with the handlebar, etc. The net (close as I recall) is that, if you are supporting most of your upper body weight with your hands (vs back) and you weight much more than about 150 pounds then the pressure on the hands will inevitably cut off blood circulation. Padded gloves or bars only slightly increase the size of contact area and thus only slightly raise the amount of weight that can be supported. So basically it's necessary to somehow vary the contact area regularly, so that bloodflow is not deprived of any area of the hand for too long (more than maybe 5-10 minutes). With drop bars you have a number of possible hand positions, so varying position is not too hard so long as you remember. (One tends to forget when one gets tired, though.) I also once had a pair of gloves that had a pad in them made of ribbed rubber that circumvented this problem nicely. The ribbing meant that blood could flow between the ribs so that even slight changes in hand position would keep the blood flowing (and possibly the ribbing served to "pump" the blood as well). Unfortunately the gloves wore out and I never found another pair (gel gloves came into vogue and pushed out any other options). I then experimented with placing a ribbed surface on the bar and found this so effective that I could ride for hours without gloves, but I kinda stopped long touring and so never pursued it more. 

Certainly there are many (mostly urban) bike shops that push the concept of cycling to replace auto usage. Perhaps if you check the "hippie" (what would be a good modern term?) bike shops in a few large towns you'll find one or two nearly as extreme as you describe. Certainly not the rule, though. 

Are the holes always on the tread side of the tube? Do you often go over curbs or other large bumps with the bike? The possibilities are: 

Nashbar, Performace Bike, and Campmore are good mail-order sources -- they carry expensive stuff, yes, but also some that's reasonably priced. Aside from bike shops, some stores dealing in outdoor wear (eg, Cabela's) may be worth checking out for suitable stuff. In particular, suitable socks and cold-weather wear may be found there. Plain old cotton T-shirts are good at sweat-wicking in warmer weather, though in cool or rainy weather they're less than ideal. You can buy them by the bag full at Wally World or that fancy French place -- Target. For socks I only use ones made from Coolmax -- the fiber is excellent at sweat absorbing, doesn't get clammy, and provides a modicum of padding even when wet. It's often hard to find exactly what I want (styles change rapidly, and the low-rise style I like is especially rare), but places like The Sock Company usually have a decent selection. (It's also often hard to tell, on reading the internet description, how thick a sock is, etc, so I always order just one pair, and if I like them I re-order another 6-8.) 

You could sell the bike whole, for someone else to part out. But I feel that the others are being a bit anal about selling the parts. After all, many bikes are subjected to far more abuse than this TA produced. A bicycle is a remarkably robust device. The frame (obviously), the front wheel, the fork, and the headset should be tossed (though the front wheel hub may be salvageable). The handlebar and stem, unless visibly bent/damaged, should be safe. Inspect the cranks to see if they've been bent. If not, then the cranks and BB cart should be good. If the rear wheel has remained true, then it is good. And obviously, brake parts, derailers, etc, are good unless bent. You should, of course, disclose that the parts are from a traffic-damaged bicycle. And I would agree with the others that the amount you get may not be worth the effort. (You might consider instead donating the bike to a local bikes-for-kids group that would strip it for parts.) (Or you could repair the bike. The frame can actually be repaired, if what's in the picture is the worst of it, and if the front wheel is not totally tacoed it can likely be trued to a substantial degree (though probably not perfect). Of course, it wouldn't really be worth the effort, but it would be a challenging "project".) 

"Chain binding" occurs when the chain is really tight around the sprockets. No set of sprockets is perfectly round and centered (especially if worn a bit), and if the chain is tight at one spot in the rotation it likely will become too tight with another half-turn or so. The pressure of the chain on the sprockets makes the crank more difficult to turn, or, if the sprockets are really off-centered (though likely not visibly so) the crank may lock up entirely simply because the chain isn't long enough to reach all the way around. Even if the sprockets are perfectly uniform and centered, the friction of the chain links against the teeth will contribute to a sort of "drag", if the chain is too tight. Note that this is different from having a "frozen link", which is a defect in the joining of an individual pair of links in the chain. 

Basically, nothing you've replaced so far is out of the ordinary for a well-used bike, other than perhaps the seat. I've worn out two front rings, two clusters, easily six chains (which I now replace every thousand miles, just on general principle), and at least a dozen spokes (not counting those I've replaced when I relaced "tired" wheels). Replaced entire wheel sets a couple of times. Also, two bottom brackets, three sets of pedals, and a couple of wheel bearings. Never replaced a freewheel, but they do fail on "good" bikes. This would be in maybe 10,000 miles of riding on three bikes. Someone heavier and/or more muscular (I had polio as a child) would likely wear things out about twice as fast as I do, and off-roading in a bike not designed for it will obviously take an early toll on the bike (as will riding a bike clearly meant for a smaller, lighter person). I have heard of forks failing (rarely), and, unfortunately, there's no reliable way to know if one is about to fail. Some forks are very well built, others not so well, some are built such that cracks will be obvious, others have designs that will conceal cracks. But looking at the picture of your bike it looks like a reasonably good fork design that would not conceal cracks and not be prone to premature failure. I've never heard of a catastrophic handlebar or stem failure, and I would judge them quite unlikely. But there does come a time when it's best to retire an old bike and get a new (and hopefully better) one. I wouldn't discourage you from doing this, but it doesn't seem imperative in your case. 

There is the practical reason that for the first 2-3 seconds of riding the bike is generally unstable, and the ability to hold a steady course is limited. Trying to get the bike moving while cars are whizzing past within inches is definitely unnerving and possibly risky. (And cars will tend to pass closer to a standing bike than a moving one.) 

Water bottles?? Clean and hygienic?? If you can scrape off the crust of road mud on the spout they're clean enough. (Actually, I just rinse mine out in very hot tap water, though for a brand new one I'll use a few drops of dish soap to help get rid of the manufacturing oils and the plastic taste. Sometimes for new bottles I'll fill them with hot water and just let sit a few hours, then empty, to get rid of the taste.) The bottles generally fail in the cap seal or nozzle eventually, at which time I discard them. [Seriously, I rarely clean water bottles. If one has set over winter half-full of water I'll put a little effort into cleaning out the resulting scum, otherwise I just rinse with hot water occasionally (and never on a week-long bike ride -- just fill and go).] 

Plain old Mucinex (without the "-D" suffix) is guaifenesin, one of the most innocuous drugs in existence. Unless you have a peculiar (and rare) reaction to it, it should be about as safe as one can hope for. In fact, I'd recommend it if you ride in dry or dusty conditions. Mucinex-D, on the other hand, contains a decongestant that can cause drowsiness and other such symptoms in a substantial minority of patients. (And I believe it can also be picked up in pro sports drug tests.) You should take that while riding only after you've established that you don't react to it (and you're not in pro competition). Also, of course, if you find yourself getting congested on rides that's a likely sign that you need to drink more water. 

The bike toolkits you'll find at Walmart and the like are near worthless -- the tools are poor quality and frequently not really usable. (Eg, the "dumbell" wrench that's often included is too bulky to fit in many places where you might need it.) Either get a multitool made by one of the mfgrs mentioned in Freiheit's post or collect the individual tools you need, bought at a good hardware store, with the few specialty pieces bought at a bike shop. Keep in mind that you don't need tools that don't fit your bike (but you may need, eg, two copies of one particular size of wrench in order to tighten some fastener on your bike, so even with the multitool you may need a few other pieces). And don't scrimp on tools -- a poor-quality wrench can wreck a bolt to where it can't be removed from the bike. In terms of oil, don't use ordinary motor oil or "3 in 1" -- buy purpose-made bicycle chain oil at a bike shop. The bike shop people can describe to you the differences between the various types. For cleaning your chain consider getting a chain scrubber (along with the appropriate chain cleaner fluid). If you want to carry tools on your bike, the best way is with a tool bag that straps under your seat. You can actually improvise this with just a maybe 16" square of canvas and some buckle/Velcro straps (just roll up the tools into a bundle), though a purpose-made bag is nice. For the tools that stay home, a simple plastic box or a "tool roll" is often a better choice than a compartmented toolbox. For removing and installing tires I'm partial to the Quick Stick rather than conventional tire levers -- much less chance of damaging the tube, and generally a lot faster. However, it won't work on some particularly tight tires. In terms of how to do things, Park Tool Company has an excellent web site that covers virtually everything you might want to do. 

Fenders and racks can be added to most conventional "diamond frame" bikes (though it's nice to have a frame with the mounting bosses already present). However, fenders are problematical on skinny-tire (less than 28mm or so) road bikes and both fenders and racks can be a problem on bikes with "suspensions". For those you need to have some assurance from a knowledgeable person that suitable components can be found and attached. You don't need aluminum or other exotic frame materials -- the additional weight of a steel frame is not that significant for your use. Suspension is also unnecessary for street riding (and is mostly there to "suck in" the macho types), unless you're dealing with giant potholes, though a shock-absorbing seatpost is sometimes a worthwhile add-on. Though purists will turn up their noses, it's nice to have a (decent) kickstand. Based on your criteria, that Fuji Crosstown looks pretty good to me -- fenders, rack, shockpost, 700/35 wheels, reasonably decent components and gearing [though unnecessary AL frame and front suspension]. About all I'd likely do (if I weren't a drop handlebar guy) is change out the seat. 

There should be no difference, other than the quality of the materials and workmanship. One can clamp just as tightly as the other, and both will be apt to produce the same symptoms if the bar is slightly undersized or too flimsy at the mount point. In both cases, if you do have a slightly-undersized bar you want to keep you can grind down the faces of the clamp a hair (though it would tend to deface the upper unit more). I suspect the main difference between the above units is weight and "sex appeal" -- the upper unit appears likely to be a few grams lighter, and it's that cool black color.
