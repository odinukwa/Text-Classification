Here are some possibilities. They each work for very specific "worlds": Force use is not genetic. There are "force spirits" that are born into people. The number if force spirits are either fixed or grow at a specific rate. Force use requires more than one gene change to produce results. It takes a specific combination of these genes to produce a force user. Also, if the combinations isn't just right it results in a terminal mutation. That would make force uses appear to be randomly generated because any time you had a population with almost the right set of genes, most of them would miscarry. Most babies that can use the force die from it. Maybe the fetus reads too many minds and dies from shock, maybe it tries TK (as it kicks and moves arms) and causes cellular damage while still in the womb. This would result in only the force users who are too weak to manifest on their own surviving. Personally, I favor the second option. 

What is wrong with using a smaller version of whatever allows the main ship to maneuver? It likely has a propulsion system that allows it to roam around a solar system easily. It should be able to land and lift a vehicle. If for some reason that sub-light drive cannot be used to land on a planet, try keeping a hot pile of some fissionable. Pour water on it and throw the steam out the thrusters. The steam would not be radioactive unless your system was very poorly designed. 

I would like a realistic evolutionary path for non-hominid humanoids, but evolution is extremely complex and varied, so I will narrow the question to examining how evolution might occur in felines to produce a humanoid. I would like to start with the Pseudaelurus (a prehistoric cat) and move to an upright walking, fingered and toed omnivore (cat's are obligate, "true", carnivores). I think I have a reasonable idea for how to evolve their diet (included below for reference), but I'm stuck trying to come up with a reason for hominid like fingers and toes and upright walking. My question is, what types of environmental/cultural/etc... changes could lead to a feline developing upright walking and hands capable of hominid like grasping? Evolution of Diet: Assuming the cats were native to a plains environment with ample hunting opportunities, an environmental shift (ocean's rising, tectonics, something else) could force the felines into a wooded environment with a much smaller number of prey. This would lead to adaptations for including fruits and other forest products into their diets. It would most likely also favor tree climbing adaptations like those seen in leopards. 

First you need to answer if there will be another other celestially periodic behavior. Are there moons? Do they orbit in regular patterns? Are there other planets in the system that are detectable? Is the planet in a perfectly circular orbit? Lacking celestial observations I would think that the people would judge time based on some biological metric. Most likely judging their "year" to be dependent on their most commonly grown crop. Or some other local flora or fauna's life cycle. As they got more advanced they would most likely discover periodic motion of pendulums and such and tune their time keeping to a specific length pendulum. Until they got sufficiently advanced enough to develop atomic clocks. 

Out of character: I'm willing to change some aspects of how zombies work, but I'd much rather use what I've specified here if possible. If I didn't mention it, feel free to assume it can be whatever you want it to be. Also, I don't need the zombies to stay alive, I just need the initial devastation. Specifically, I need: 

Apologies for the extremely weird title. Admittedly, it describes my question well. Now, I'm making a universe where humans have discovered the big secret to space travel. It's actually pretty simple; all you have to do is ████████. Who'd have thought? Now, the problem with easy space travel in a species with low lifespan is that terraforming takes too long. Humans don't wanna wait for stuff, so instead of letting our machines make the planet perfect, we have a tendency to settle when it's barely livable. That means that not all of the chemicals and stuff are out of the air, but there's nothing so toxic that it'd kill people very fast. With that in mind, what colors can the sky be if the atmosphere is breathable? For the sake of the question, please also assume that the gravity, temperature, etc. of the planet is also livable, with modern-day tech. High-altitude stuff is fine -- as long as people can live on the surface, I don't care. Space ships are airtight anyway. Bonus points if you make it snow- or cold-related. 

You would need another 2 solar masses since the minimum size for a neutron star to collapse into a black hole is about 3 solar masses (2.7 to 3.2 solar masses as far as I have seen). The density of the potato isn't the issue, just the mass. The main problem that I can see is that you would have to act fast. As the potatoes burn up, they will be "poisoning" the Sun with carbon. When the ratio gets high enough, the carbon will get in the way of too many hydrogen or helium collisions. The might lead to a premature death of the Sun. 

If technology developed alongside magic, I can see a world where Insulars and Mages coexist. In this case, magic just provides alternative solutions to problems (need to get somewhere: fly or drive; need to hurt someone from a distance: zap with spell or shoot with gun). In this case magic can make quick, one off changes to the world but would not benefit from economies of scale. You might be able to summon an item but summoning 100,000 items would be harder than tooling a factory to produce them. Unless Mages are prevented from using technology, Insulars are going to have a distinct disadvantage. If a Mage can carry a gun, the Insular isn't much more of a threat than a Mundane. Insulars would have to relay on the slower healing times of real medicine. However, Insulars would make great cops and first responders. If some idiot Mage summoned demon, send in the Insulars. If some mage is growing senile, give them an Insular caregiver (who will not get turned into a toad). 

I'm writing an autobiography of my life in the post-Zed world. Now, I think the effects of the Zeds have been obvious – total obliteration of any worldwide infrastructure, severe depopulation, turning most or all major cities and even smaller ones into zombie-ridden hellscapes. Nowadays, any area with a population over fifty is either very well cleared or doomed. Now, when the zombies emerged and conquered the world, I wasn't there; I was on a small island in the Pacific, starving to death. I only saw the aftermath from after a few months had passed, with zombies still covering the planet and only scattered enclaves. What I do know is this: 

I'm writing a story, based vaguely off of the Stars Without Number system. There are lots of things bugging me, but by far the biggest issue is this: the military contractors and bounty hunters and the like are all congregating in the war-torn areas, waiting to be hired, instead of relaxing in luxury, waiting to be called. There's mostly reliable, long-distance superluminal communication, but only in the sense that you can put a message on a ship (or into the ship's computers) and have that ship carry it, mostly reliably, between systems. How can I explain why PMCs would do anything but stay at home, waiting to be hired to fight? 

If you think I forgot to mention something, feel free to mention it below. Now, my question is this: How did the zombies win? You'd think that humanity would have pretty quickly organized an army and killed the zombies easily, given that we can do things like climb ladders and drive tanks and they can't. What happened? 

Several issues with this idea. 1) The vast majority of the solar wind is composed of electrons and protons, with small amounts of helium, oxygen, and other heavy elements depending on if the solar wind is coming from coronal holes or contains a solar flare/CME. 2) The particles coming to the poles (through the length process of day-side reconection, tail transport, lobe compression, and night side reconnection) are not moving perpendicular to the magnetic field, they are moving along the field (parallel) so the only difference between charged motion is the gyro-orbit, which you would be hard pressed to separate in a meaningful way. 3) Aurora are actually caused by the night side reconnection releasing large amounts of stored energy into the poles. This is not a continuous process but occurs in spurts. In addition, most of the charged particles coming into the poles are electrons, further limiting the amount of oxygen you are going to be able to collect. Overall, even with only a small energy draw, there won't be enough charge separation to power a contraption such as this with just polar flux. You are also only going to collect a very small amount of oxygen and even less from other elements. Even if you removed the artificial magnetosphere and collected the solar wind directly there won't be enough to create an artificial atmosphere.
