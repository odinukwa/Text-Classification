I would add that Holland was the financial centre of the Earth in 17-18th centuries. NY, having the best specialists in finances simply couldn't fail. 

Aztecs did know about Mayas but the Mayan civilization was already dead. But of course, they did traded with its descendants - even prehistoric men traded with their neighbours. And no direct contacts for the contemporary Incas civilization. $URL$ The only question remains open - if Incas knew about Mayas 

This thesis appeared in the "The Humans nature" book. Ancients thought it was the work of Hippocrates, but sooner it was the work of his son-in-law Polibius. It is got from STORIA DELLA FILOSOFIA (REALE - ANTISERI), the first volume. Oh, wiki says this, too. $URL$ (On the Nature of Man is a work in the Hippocratic Corpus.) What about observations, it is not strange to me, that very few articles mention observations conducted by Hyppocrates. In the Antic world the knowledge had to be pure, not tainted by the low reality. It had to go from inside. Remember Aristoteles, that thought that flies have 4 legs and never tried to recount. So, even if Hippocrates did measured something (he could, for medicine couldn't be without practice), he would never write about it somewhere. IMHO, the articles mentioned fall into the vice of anachronism. They give post-Bacon philosophy to the scientists of the pre-Bacon times. Even if there will be found some later work that would mention such observations of Hippocrates, it would be mostly probable, that some later scientist simply covered so his own observations by the authority of Hippocrates - very usual practice in the Middle Ages. 

All of these materials can be used as a solid lubricant as well. Making them of strategic importance for military purposes. England banned the export of pencils to Napoleonic France, since the containing graphite is ideal as a lining for casting cannonballs. (Source: Scientific American: Carbon Wonderland (2088)) Like galena graphite was also used to glaze or line pottery vessels, making them more fire proof. 

Unofficially the strictest prohibitions against fraternisation were already largely ignored and some previous plans to condemn the whole nation were abandoned. 

Comparing both autopsies archived officially at (AT-OeStA/HHStA UR FUK 2790, 2791 Title: Zwei nach dem Ableben der Kaiserin und Königin Elisabeth aufgenommene legalisierte Protokolle über die stattgehabte Leichenschau und Autopsie (Obduktion) (1898.09.12)) reveals that they are consisting of more pages than are visible in the picture above. Both went through multiple hands and this is also visible by the numerous seals and impressions and additions with pencils and so on. 

That he was baptised as one of the last things he went through in life seems uncontroversial. Whether he was old Roman pagan, Mithraist, Arian, Nicean creed Christian in terms of true belief seems hard to ascertain for any one point in time and even more uncertain for a stringent line of his life. Instead, one thing seems very certain, that he was a true politician. 

I think, it depends on whom do you consider as a descendant. Biologically, they were swallowed by Kipchaks. As for culture, it was accepted by Rus, Magyars, Kipchaks. Only smaller branches remained for longer time. Khavars in Hungaria. And of course, in contemporary Dagestan. Every nation or people of the plains along Black and Caspian Seas had some branch that escaped and remained as one of the numberless dagestan nations. In this area there are more languages than in the whole Europe. As for the exact name, there are opinions, that mountain jews are the descendants of Khazars. It is very probable, I think. 

Loki and Hermes are well-known gods of thievery. As for saints, St. Nicolas is the patron of thieves. As for clans, often there was some community of people that had any normal work forbidden by the society or some inner rules. Some opressed small nation could choose non-collaboration policy and crime remained their only way of living. Gipsies or something similar. So the clan often appeared as a ready thing, from the start, you are right here, IMHO. Crime was always very well organized. The head thief in the late 18 cent. in Moscow became even the head of the police. Pirates in Rome times terrorized all the empire and had even their state. in Kilikia. (Also they had a state 1500 years later in Madagascar). When a state is doing some its function badly, some crime organization will always appear to cover the function. And as our states are organized poorly mostly, the result is obvious. Please, correct the question. The header and the body ask for different things. 

The office of archchancellor had changing roles over time, his duties, rights and powers fluctuating even more. He was the highest ranking official of the Reich when this entity confronted the Emperor as an independent organisation. He called and presided over an election for Emperor. In later times he also anointed the King or Emperor. All written affairs of the Reich went through his hands and ended up in his archive. This means that since this office was called totius Germanie archicancellarius his office served as notary function in writing, receiving and authenticating or witnessing correspondence, especially foreign correspondence and those letters sent between sovereigns within he empire,, records and deeds. The first man to hold this exact and than solidified title was Christian von Buch. As can be seen from his Wikipedia page, at this early stage the archchancellor himself was not so much into writing but fighting, comparatively. How exactly the actual power was distributed and exercised has to be determined on a case by case basis. Berthold von Henneberg in the late 15th century and oder Johann Philipp von Schönborn were quite powerful adversaries to the Emperor, others were more cooperating. Some Emperors were pre-occupied with other, external affairs, giving the Archchancellor considerably more leeway in day to day affairs. This was especially marked in the 15th century and during the 30 years war. After the Peace of Westphalia this influence started to diminish and most functions and powers where gradually absorbed by the Viennese chancellery serving primarily the Habsburgs and the Austrian interests. At the turn to the 16th century Berthold was prominent in conducting his own foreign policy, writing in the name of the Empire, using the imperial seal. That side show to trying to erect a Reichsregiment were the Emperor would have been reduced to mere figurehead was quite short lived. Of much longer lasting effect were the responsibilities in arbitration, both legally and militarily. Throughout the middle-ages the sovereigns resolved their disputes more often than not through armed conflict. This was transformed by Ewiger Landfrieden into a legal procedure were the feuding battles should be transformed into arguments and settlements presented to a court. This Reichskammergericht (Imperial Chamber Court) was called and presided by the Archchancellor and also their enforcing subsidiary units, the Imperial Circles reported back to him. Later: 

Of course, it happened many times when the country was conquered, later got its freedom and returned to the previous language, that it used before that last conquest. Sometimes the language even started to change before the real freedom came, as in Czech lands in 19th century, when they started to learn they own almost dead language. The question is formulated obviously by a person, who lives in the mono-language culture. There are others, too. In the older Europe people very often used many languages - one at home, other in the village, third in the town, two more - with traders. For example, in Dagestan even now there are villages, where 2 languages are used that are no used in any other place. Of course, they also know 2-3 wider known Dagestan languages and Russian, too. How do you count these people? And the picture in all old Europe was as that one. There were very many languages in France, in Germany, really in any country. They were no dialects, they were really very different. 

The building was not covered in mosaic icons like a collage of comic strips, but very heavily decorated, with indeed *many *icons. Out of all those mosaics used, most were ornamental and intended as a "play with light". 

An exercise that after World War II was done again, of course. And after World War I it was not unimaginable to separate especially Rhine-provinces and Bavaria from the Reich. Bavaria had to be bribed into the union from the start. The Rhenish resented Prussian rule, were catholic and had separatist tendencies, leanings and sympathy for the French who furthered their independence movement, occupied the zone in question for a time. They Rhenish and the Bavarians resented and still resent to a degree the Prussians. And they speak another language too: 

For very practical reasons, these pure leisure activities did not take place close to enemy shores, or in climates that were just too uninviting. Close to the "Golden West" of American targets airplanes would be just much too quick to approach and the highest latitudes just too cold and often just too windy to be of any joy. But the crews did try to enjoy every single opportunity at fresh air, everywhere. "On deck" on a boat means also on the top of the conning tower! Given the cramped conditions, bad smells and comparative darkness in the boats' interiors, this was almost necessary. As the question is framed, it appears to be about being on the hull of the boat, outside the conning tower. This was done to make repairs, to practice with the secondary weapon, to dispose of waste. Just to name activities still involving duty. But pure leisurely spare time was restricted to the relative safety of the air gap when look outs could relax somewhat since ships were relatively slow and planes unlikely. A surprising detail might be found in that at night the crew's movement was more restricted than during the day. Clear skies and long range visibility of enemy crafts was the deciding factor. A map of the air gap shows that the vast majority of the Atlantic was for a long time considered quite safe for U-boats: 

I think that on entering Russia, in full parade, with banners, it was one music, and in the camp in the described situation, it was totally another one. In the second case they simply sang songs that French people sang these times. In the first case, it were some official marches, France hymn included. I was in acting army myself (Chernobyl catastrophe liquidation, a radiometrist) and I was in student camps. Songs were practically the same. Only first-year students sang more often these indecent ones. Youth loves to shock. And elder people (and soldiers mostly are not teens), have no need to shock anybody. Soldiers have enough of it in battle. But... soldiers had little, really very little freedom for themselves. (And nowadays, too, for the main task of sergeants is to make soldiers busy) And if they have an hour for their heart, they wanted to be normal men, if only to be them more intensively (too little time for everything - remember?). So, when they were at rest, their chose more "strong" songs. Intensive for their feelings. But mostly these were civil songs, for they want to forget the war at least for the time of rest. As I remember my experience, often they were about love. Even more popular were joke songs. And later, after war, when some of soldiers will return home, they don't like marches. They don't like to recall the war. You can't imagine, what pain it is. The only way to recall the war and not to got crazy, is a joke. Or joke song, of course. ... And the songs about the return home. If written by some soldier, or folk ones, they mostly are sad. On the contrary, these, written by half-official poets, are full of energy, but are never sung out of marching. (they are often chosen as marchs). Marches were used for setting the rythm of ehm.. march. They are useful. And they and only they can be considered as specific soldier songs. Because to sing them is the part of their work. In Russia there are really beautiful Cossack's songs. Cossack's are free soldiers. Their songs are often only somewhat warlike, and are widely known and sung. But in the acting army, never had I head somebody to sing any war song or even a Cossack one. I haven't even seen a person to hear such song by radio. On the contrary, as for students, about 20% of our songs were about war, or soldiers, or some of Cossack repertoir. War songs are for civillians. And when a soldier murmured quietly something cleaning his gun, it was the same song that he murmured making shoes or drying hay, sometime in the past. All of said is about real soldiers, that fought. As for rear and staff officers, intendants and such people, THEY like to look maximally warlike and to speak about battles, courage and things, and to sing brave songs. That adjutant that you had mentioned, surely, loved war songs and his friend officers made or even asked soldiers to sing them for him. There are songs, that could be chosen by some troop as their beloved one. Don't forget, that often it was the officer or sergeant who decided instead of soldiers what is beloved for them. Don't mix imaginary romantics with the real life. As for French soldiers in Napoleonic wars, their troops for the first time in history mixed people from different French regions. And they exchanged songs of their home and created a new whole-France folk culture. But they didn't brought it back from the Russian winter. Most of these few, who remained alife, remained in Russia afterward and were mostly individually separated. They never created such communities as Jews. Only few songs could remain in human memory after that. I would look in the old Russian books of French songs from the start of 19 cent. But surely, they are not on the net. Maybe, it is possible to find on the net the names of such books. And later somebody can try to look for them in some special part of a good library. 

If we look at sub-saharan Africa then the times for categorising these "ages" are a bit shifted and stretched compared with Asia, Europe and North-Africa. 

Being awfully broad as it is, it is nevertheless an issue that might be addressable. But the terminology needs to be clearer. "Jews", in our modern sense, sprang into existence only after 70 CE. Some scholars argue that this process took even longer. Before that we have Israelites, Yehudites, Judeans, Juda(h)ites, Hebrews and so on. Those terms are partly interchangeable and partly quite distinct. "Genetically and physically distinct" are very disputable terms as both concepts here are on the border of (scientific) racism, and unfortunately a bit too far on the wrong side of that border. "Ethiopian and Oriental Jews" are by far not the only groups that thwart such attempts. The modern day Samaritans, Djerbans and Lemba, to name just a few prominent groups, add a very colourful genetic makeup into the statistic. Such a biostatistic seems to make it easy to construct clearly defined stereotypes – while in reality neither the individual nor the spectrum of people, communities and peoples are well depicted. Israelite origins are to be found in cultural distinctions and separations, not in biological or even pseudo-biological categorisations: 

So, the answer depends on the rules and roles set for you. If you were a cleaner, the missing owner can interest you only in the sense what rooms to clean today and what tomorrow. But if you were a head of "guards", or some other safety structure, it would be your direct business to go and try to find and help your master. If you were the part of the economic government of the latifundia, and your actions need some official acknowledgment of the master, of course, it is up to you to know where he is in order to get it. And if he is missed, you should look for him or organize appropriate actions. And of course, if you are an only slave of the owner, you simply must find the missed master - you would be expected to do that. But you were not LEGALLY required to do it. It was not due to law, but due to your duties in the estate you belonged to. And due to your personal human qualities, too, of course. The Romans understood good and evil. 

A real "Gold mark" it is not. Real leather it is, originally intended for shoe soles. This is Notgeld or Ersatz-money, issued after the Great War during the period known as hyperinflation and was one of the last tries to combat the consequences of inflation on a local level. Although most of these were printed on fancy papers, intended for local circulation, especially in Thuringia other substrates, like leather went public. One of these was on auction here or here: 

But there are some circumstantial pieces of evidence that allow a glimpse of the complicated realities in the still mixed and tolerant empire. Among them is a giant one: 

Smoking anything was an official cure for Asthma and other conditions of the throat and lung. While the main ingredient was tobacco, several other herbs were added to increase the effect. Among them belladonna, datura, and our new wonder drug: cannabis. Examples are numerous. These were sold in pharmacies until the 1970s for West-Germany and a little longer in the East. But since the question seems to be about pure and ordinary tobacco cigarettes…
