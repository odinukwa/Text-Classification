Basically the run is recorded only if all the runners were "safe" initially. That is, a batter made it to first base (safe) while the runner on third came home, then the batter was tagged out trying for second base. Or a fly ball was recorded for the second out. All baserunners (not counting the hitter) were safe initially. The third base runner tagged up and came home. A first base runner tagged up and was tagged out at second. The last out must have been through a voluntary play of the runner, not a forced out. 

A foul ball is an intermediate result between a "strike" (a total miss) and a "fair ball" (one that goes into play). Logically, a foul ball should be scored in an intermediate fashion between a strike and a fair ball as well. One way of doing this is to count "half" strikes for a foul ball. That would cause a certain amount of game confusion keeping track of these "half" strikes. Another way of achieving a comparable, and equitable, result is to award the first two foul balls in an at bat as strikes to the pitcher, and the remaining ones as "free" shots to the batter. In practice, it would mean that about half the foul balls are counted as strikes, and about half (after the second one) are not. In theory, it means the that "burden of proof" is on the hitter to put the ball in play on the first two fouls, but for the third strike, the "burden of proof" is on the pitcher to get a "full" (not a foul, or "half") strike. It's not unfair for the pitcher to have foul balls recorded as strikes, while the batter is not put out. All contacted balls (plus called strikes) are strikes for the pitcher. That includes "fair balls" that become hits, or outs, as well as foul balls, whether or not they become "strikes" for the batter. 

In football, the winner of the coin toss can elect to "receive" or "defer." The advantage of "deferring" is that you get to receive after halftime, meaning that teams will often elect this option. In tennis, the winner of the coin toss can elect to serve (or not). Are there any compensating reasons to decline the serve, as in football? Does any world class player routinely do this? 

It has been observed that in baseball, a home team has a statistical 54-46 advantage, all other things being equal. There have been various theories to account for this, including the impact of fan support, and possible "home team" bias by umpires. But there may be a more tangible home team advantage called the "principle of last action." This advantage derives from the fact that the home team bats and score last in every inning, and in the game itself. In poker, there is a large advantage to being last, and seeing what other people have done. For instance, if you are "last" with a mediocre hand, and have observed other people betting timidly (or not at all), you might bet to steal the pot. If others have "raised" each others' bets, you might "fold" and let the stronger hands fight it out. If you were first to go with the same, mediocre hand, you would have to bet (or not) without knowing what others wanted to do. Beginning in the ninth, and all the extra innings, if the home team ever takes the lead, the visiting team will not have a "return" opportunity in a subsequent inning. The home team can win in a one-run "walk-off," while the visiting team will have to score as many runs as they can in the top of the ninth, and hope that they are "enough." Say the game is tied at the end of the eigth inning, and the visiting team scores x runs in the TOP of the ninth. The home team knows that it needs to score exactly X runs to tie, and x+1 runs to win. It can manage it "bench" in the bottom of the ninth for maximum effect. On the other hand, if the visiting team has a one run lead in the top of the ninth, it must wonder, is that enough? Can we save the bench for tomorrow, or do we need to "pile on," now? Likewise, the visiting team has to make a decision in the bottom of the ninth whether to use as many pitchers as it takes to stop the tying run, or save relievers for an extra inning game. Other sports such as football and basketball don't have such a clear separation of offensive and defensive "rounds." (In those sports, unlike baseball, it is possible for a defender to "run back" the ball for a touchdown or basket.) Could this separation of offense and defense be what lends a home field advantage in baseball? 

I can think of two instances where this comes into play. One is if the kick-off falls behind the receiving goal line, and the runner chooses to "down" the ball in the endzone rather than run it out. This allows the receiving team to start at 20 yard line "for sure" instead of taking their chances with a running play. The second is if the offensive team's ball carrier is tackled in his own end zone for a "safety," this team has to make a free kick from its 20 yard line (instead of from the 40 yard line). How and why was the 20 yard line chosen for these purposes? And why was the "20" yard line changed to the 25 yard line for both touchbacks and safeties in college football in 2012? 

A center needs to have the firmest hands because he is the one "hiking" the ball to the quarterback. Together with a center, the guards are the ones protecting the quarterback at the beginning of the play, so they tend to be bigger and slower, than say, the tackles. The tackles typically "do their thing" AFTER the play gets under way, so they need to be quicker and more versatile than the centers. If for instance, a halfback wants to go to the "outside," the tackles need to block defenders "inside." If a fullback wants to run a "draw play" (inside), the tackles need to push defenders outside. 

For example, America's Bryan Brothers excel at doubles tennis. Yet neither of them are recognized singles champions. Do they communicate/co-ordinate better than other doubles pairs? Are there other skills that help them excel at doubles that aren't relevant to singles? Might growing up as (twin) brothers help them in this regard? 

Pittsburgh Pirates just made a couple of egregious ones. Frank Cervelli doubled. John Jaso doubled, and Frank Cervelli stopped at third, instead of scoring. With one out, on the following play, Jordy Mercer flied out Cervelli came home. But John Jaso was "picked off" running to third, preventing the run from scoring. Yet I didn't see these miscues scored as error. All the errors I see are defensive errors? Why is that, is that because offensive errors are so rare? 

Almost all football players are drafted out of college, rather than high school, because the extra "seasoning" in college makes them league ready, or nearly so (this is not true in baseball). But suppose there was a high school kicker, who could routinely kick field goals from the 50-year line or further? Would a major league team consider drafting him or her for that particular skill without the further practice in college on the theory that "kicking" ability is basically independent of what else happens on the field (there is normally no contact for the kicker.) Or are anti-kick defenses much better in the "pros" than in high school? According to NFL rules, this could take place only several years after the high school graduation, unless this person applied for, and was granted "special eligibility," so maybe this person maintains the skill in junior college or abroad. And most people who are, say, 5' 5" and 170 pounds (like the Houston Astros' Jose Altuve) would not be considered "playable" on an NFL football field, particularly if female. But could "kicker" be an exception to this rule? 

The starter left after five innings with a one run lead. (Actually, he was "pulled" after letting the first two batters on base in the sixth.) A reliever comes on, "strands" the two inherited runners in the sixth, then pitches the seventh and the eighth, that is a total of three innings. From what I understand, pitching three innings is one way to earn a save. A closer pitches the ninth. And neither side scored after the starter left so the lead remained at one run. Does the closer automatically get the save? Or might the three inning pitcher get the credit since he stranded two inherited runners? And it isn't possible for both of them to get the save, is it, even though both "qualify?" 

I can think of a couple instances where it is an advantage for the athlete to be small. They are both "racing" situations, and the athlete in question is a "controller." The first is the "coxswain" (caller) on a rowing team. His function is necessary, but the smaller he is, the less burden on his teammates. The second, as someone else pointed out, is a jockey on a horse, where the jockey has the dual role of controlling the horse and not being a burden on the horse. 

In a "regular" game, a starter pitches "several" innings while a reliever pitches one or two. But in the All Star game, "all" pitchers pitch only one to two innings. So what has historically been the difference between the way managers have used starters versus relievers in such a game? For instance, has it been the case that only starters will get to pitch even two innings? 

Let's say you have men on first and third. The batter draws a "base on (four balls), and goes to first. The man on first is "pushed" to second, but the man on third stays where he is, because there is no "push" from second. Now, suppose there are men on first and third. The pitcher balks. The batter goes to first, the man on first goes to second. But in this afternoon's Reds Pirates game, Homer Bailey's balk apparently sent the man on third home for a run, Why would the rules be different for a balk than a base on balls? 

Here, I'm not talking about balls that barely miss the strike zone, being barely outside the plate or below the knees. More like pitches that go into the dirt, or six inches wide of the plate. What makes batters sometimes chase such pitches? Do they really believe that they can hit them? Or has the pitcher fooled them into believing that they will be called strikes even when they miss by a wide margin? 

"In tennis, having the right to "serve" (put in play) the ball is a decided advantage, so players alternate serves between games, sharing this advantage. Between two almost evenly matched players, whoever serves will win most games, by "holding serve." But in the typical "set," the better of the two players will win an occasional game while the other person is serving, a result that is known as "breaking serve." [The person whose serve is broken is said to "go down a break."] This, together with the fact that he or she is serving half the time and (presumably) holds all serves, means that the slightly better player will likely win the set by getting a majority of the games with a score of say, 6-4. If a player both holds serve and breaks serve consistently, the result could be a more lop-sided 6-0 tally that clearly demonstrates who is the better player." Except for the boldfaced part in brackets, this tennis analogy was used years ago in a piece of mine on the stock market. 

Table tennis is to "real" tennis as "miniature" golf (putt-putt) is to "real golf. So there are some commonalities (and some important differences). One thing that is common to both versions of "tennis" is shot anticipation/selection. To the extent that both forms of tennis are a "mental" game, the thought processes in one can help in the other. A second thing is balance/footwork. In this case, it is the foundation of either form of tennis. On the other hand, tennis, like golf, is a much larger scale of its "miniature" version. While the latter is mostly skill, in the former, strength and stamina come into play. Basically, tennis is a "whole body" (rather than arms mainly) version of table tennis. 

If the seventh and eight batters both get on base, and one or both of them score (e.g. the second batter gets an extra base hit that scores the first batter, and possibly himself if it's a home run), I'll keep the pitcher in to protect my new (2-1 or 3-1) lead. If the seventh and eighth batters both make an out, I'll let my pitcher close the top of the inning, so he can pitch at least the bottom of the seventh, on the theory that he'll "save" more runs than we'll score by having a pinch hitter bat for him. I might even tell him to strike out intentionally so he won't run the risk of getting injured. If the seventh and eighth batters both get on base, say first and second, I'll "pinch hit" for my pitcher to try to score a go-ahead run. If the seventh and eighth batters make one single (or walk) and one out, that's a close one, because I'm undecided between trying to score, or save, an extra run. 

The "home plate" is an unusual construct, that is rectangular in front (two corners), and becomes a triangle in back (one corner). Here, "corner" refers to the two front ones. "Inside" is in relation to the batter. A right handed batter will stand to the left of the plate, so that his "inside" corner is the (left) corner closer to him, and the "outside" (right) corner is the one further from him. The reverse is true for a left handed batter. If the pitched ball stayed "totally" inside, it would be between the plate and the batter, and be a "ball." Hitting the "inside corner" means part of the baseball barely "covered" the "inside corner" of the plate for a called strike. The baseball has to go over the plate between the batter's shoulders and knees, for a "called" strike but the rule is any part of the ball over any part of the plate over the appropriate height. 

In baseball, unlike basketball or football, once a player is removed from the game, he can't be put back into the same game. That is (probably) to prevent a repetition of matchups. Example: Late in the game, you have a matchup of (lefthanded) batter X against (lefthanded) pitcher A. So the batting team replaces X with a right handed batter Y. The pitching team brings in B, a right handed pitcher. Now the batting team wants to use a left handed batter, but they can't "recycle" X. So they either have to use another left handed batter, Z, or let the new, unfavorable matchup stand. My understanding is that there is an exception involving catchers. That is, if you replace a starting catcher with a second catcher, you can put back the starting catcher. What I'm not sure about is whether this is true generally, or whether it applies only in special situations. Are there situations in which you can "recycle" a catcher (or other player) in baseball? And if so, why would that be the case? 

The baseball season is coming to a close, and with several clusters of closely matched teams, "tiebreaker" rules are coming into consideration, especially for three teams with identical records playing for the second wild card spot. In that case, the three teams will be designated A, B, and C, with A and B playing at A's home field, and C playing the winner in the winner's home field. The choices are made by the teams, with the teams getting choices in (descending) order of their head-to-head record. The "natural" choice is C (only one game to play). I can't see anyone choosing B (worst of both worlds). But might some teams choose A (two home games to qualify) over C (one road game)? Perhaps someone with a large home media market like the New York Yankees or Mets? (Neither are candidates this year.) Or perhaps a team that plays WAY better at home than on the road? 

"Rebuilding" a team means taking a group of veteran, but (mostly) mediocre players, and trading them for younger, unproven players, in the hope that the younger players will collectively "grow" into something better than what you started out with. A losing team is one that is "stuck" with mediocre players. Often, they are veterans, but some of them might have qualities that are useful to, or fill a need, on some better team. Or you might have an inadequate team with (a few) "stars and scrubs" (think Mike Trout and the rest of the Angels), in which case you have good players to trade. The better team is often "contending," and therefore wants veterans now. It is willing to give up future players to "win now." The worse team (by definition) can't win "now," and hopes that by trading present players for future players, they can win "later." Also, the teams with the worst records get the earliest picks in the "drafts." These early draft picks help teams rebuild with the most promising "rookies." An example of a rebuilding team in 2016-17 is the Chicago White Sox. Because the rest of the team was weak, they traded away stars like Chris Sale, Adam Eaton, and Jose Quintana, respectively, to "win now" teams like the Boston Red Sox, the Washington Nationals, and Chicago Cubs. The prospects they got in those trades upgraded a formerly mediocre farm system to arguably the best in baseball that could help them win in the future after they arrive in the Major Leagues. As a result, Bleacher Report projects them as the Number 5 team in 2020, even though they have few veterans left, unlike the higher-ranked Dodgers, Red Sox or Yankees.
