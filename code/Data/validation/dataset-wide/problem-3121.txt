As for 13th century sources, the nickname is certainly mentioned in the Chronique rimée by Philippe Mouskes. He cites his source as follows: 

When used to refer to the actual act of ascending, an additional determinative in the form of a pair of legs is often appended: 

All three forms were in use throughout the Hellenistic Period. For example, the Rosetta Stone is inscribed with a decree issued by Ptolemy V in 186BC. The decree is written in three scripts: Ancient Greek, hieroglyphs and demotic. Clearly, people were still speaking the ancient Egyptian language and writing using phonograms in 186BC. In fact, the last firmly datable hieroglyphic inscription we have found so far comes from the temple Isis at Philae, and was written in 394AD. Now, as mentioned in the page linked by Mark above, it is true that the ancient Egyptians introduced a significant number of new glyphs during the Hellenistic period. The Greeks also introduced new gods/cults and temples in the 3rd century BC. Perhaps the best known of these is the god Serapis who was (probably) introduced by Ptolemy I (it is also possible that Serapis was an existing god whose prominence was raised by Ptolemy I). The Ptolemies adopted many of the symbols of Egyptian kingship (Ptolemy I assumed the title "Pharaoh" in 305/4 BC), but introduced the Greek language as the official language of court. One should always be cautious when it comes to trying to understand the motivation of ancient peoples, but it seems likely that the changes in dynasty, with the associated changes in language and religious practices, and the modifications to the hieroglyphic writing system are related. 

However, we don't always have to rely solely on the evidence provided by residue analysis. There is also often supporting evidence in the form of the wear on the pottery vessel itself. It may sound strange, but fermentation actually causes what is known as "nonabrasive attrition" of the vessel in the form of spalling [Skibo, 2015, p194]. Repeated use of the vessel exacerbates the effect, and this would indicate that the fermentation was non-accidental in nature. The fact that the same evidence has been found in contexts from around the world adds further support to the idea that the fermentation was deliberate. In Ancient Egypt, we have multiple strands of evidence that a range of alcoholic drinks were prepared, including mead made from honey. In the case of Ancient Egypt, we have texts, images painted on tomb walls, and the pottery vessels themselves. Interestingly, the vessels used to produce mead in Ancient Egypt appear to present with exactly the same evidence for fermentation that we see in Bronze Age beakers from the UK and Northern Europe [Dietler, 2006]. 

The reduction was a deliberate policy. It is discussed at some length in section 2 of this paper by Hellmut Wollmann of Humboldt University. Firstly, there had been huge changes in the settlement structure in post-war Germany, especially after the partition into East and West Germany. The old regional government model was becoming overwhelmed in many areas. Secondly, regional planning policy was changing to the "Zentralörtliches System". The intent was to create a more efficient and cost-effective system, and this necessitated a smaller number of "central localities". Finally (and perhaps the strongest driver for the changes) the introduction of the expansive welfare state by the Social Democrats would just have been too unwieldy without a huge reduction in the number of municipalities. 

So John lacked Richard's martial abilities, but what of his other qualities? It seems that John was almost shockingly cruel. In an age where aristocrats would generally capture and spare their enemies, rather than kill them, John just killed them, very often by grisly means. For example, he ordered 22 captive noble knights to be taken to Corfe Castle in Dorset and starved to death. On another occasion he had the wife and son of his former friend and ally, William de Briouze, starved to death. In 1203, he also famously arranged the disappearance, and probable murder, of his own nephew (and rival for power) Arthur of Brittany. Compare this with Richard's treatment of William Marshal, and even of John himself. The chroniclers also tell us that John was lecherous. Several nobles are reported to have taken up arms against him because he had forced himself on their wives and daughters. As for taxation, the taxes imposed by Richard may have been bad, but those imposed by John were of a different order altogether. Initially, he needed money to pay for his attempts to reconquer Normandy. Taxes were demanded on an almost annual basis. Nobles were charged huge sums to inherit their lands; exorbitant fines were imposed by Royal justices for trifling offences; Church lands were seized; and Jews were imprisoned and tortured until they agreed to pay up. It's probably true to say that John’s reign saw the greatest financial exploitation of England since the Norman Conquest. And yet he still failed to retake Normandy. 

What we now know as the Gunpowder Plot began as a conspiracy between three men: Robert Catesby, John Wright and Thomas Winter. Only one of the three, Thomas Winter, survived to tell their account of the plot. That account was extracted under torture, so we should approach it with come caution, but it is the best information that we have. His confession is examined in some detail in Thomas Winter's Confession and the Gunpowder Plot by the Jesuit priest, John Gerard. While others would almost certainly argue with his conclusions, his examination of the confession is well worth reading in order to understand the controversies surrounding it. 

So, I think we can reasonably conclude that life was much more comfortable for the king than it was for the swineherd! 

For context, it is worth noting that Henry of Huntingdon's chronicle was first published, under the patronage of Alexander of Lincoln, in around 1129/1130. A second edition was published in 1135, with further editions following over the years, up to 1154. His writing style made his works popular (we have at least 25 surviving manuscripts from the period). Then, as now, (albeit to a slightly lesser extent, perhaps) a whiff of scandal sells! 

So, even if the details in the chronicles were honestly and accurately recorded, it was just the testimony of one (or, at most, two) survivors. 

It doesn't seem so. The Final Report to Congress on the conduct of the [1991] Persian Gulf War states that: 

The final part of your question, asked whether any ancient kingdoms (not including the Chinese opium wars) had problems with the citizens abusing drugs? In the Islamic world, alcohol was (and is) prohibited under Sharia law. This is often interpreted as prohibiting all intoxicants (not only alcohol). Despite that, the practice of hashish smoking seems to have continued throughout the history of Islam (against varying degrees of resistance at different times and in different places). Apart from the prohibition under Islamic Sharia law, I'm not aware of any legal prohibitions against recreational drug use in the ancient or medieval periods in Europe or the eastern Mediterranean. This suggests that, if there was a problem with recreational drug use at these periods, it wasn't considered to be serious enough to require legislation. Hopefully others can add answers which cover other recreational drugs in other geographic regions in the ancient and medieval world. 

The short answer is that we don't. The pronunciations we use today are our best guess at how the ancients pronounced their words. 

The speculation mentioned had arisen after the Japanese invasion of Burma in 1942 had cut off India’s main supply of rice imports. 

So, in their case, "post-medieval" is defined rather differently! (I'm sure you've detected a theme by now) 

Modern In this context, "Modern" can mean anything in the early-modern or late-modern periods, i.e. anything since the medieval period. So, technically this would include everything from 1485, until yesterday. OK, well not quite yesterday, but you take my point. To confuse matters still further, you will often hear specialists in Romano-British archaeology referring to anything post-Roman as "modern". This is usually with tongue firmly in cheek, but I have occasionally seen things like shards of Norman pottery in a Roman context referred to as "modern intrusions"! 

In August 272AD, Zenobia was captured and eventually sent into exile in Rome. We are told (mainly by Roman writers, writing after her capture and exile in Rome) that Zenobia styled herself "Queen of the East". [Apparently, Manichaean sources (mainly texts written in Sogdian from the Turfan Oasis) called her "Tadi".] 

The text of the Government of India Act, 1858 is available on the Statutes Project website and also on this page from South Dakota State University. 

Your first article is about research into genes carried on the Y-chromosome. Males have one X-chromosome and one Y-chromosome, while females have two X-chromosomes. So, assuming the population used for the study was representative, that would mean that at least 1 million men (out of 32 million) are direct descendants of the "Italian Romans", i.e. the population of the Roman population born in Italy that lived in the UK during the Romano-British period (43-410AD). That is just over 3% of the population. More would be descended from "Romans" who arrived from other parts of the Roman empire than Italy, and, of course, even more would be descended from the female children of immigrants to the UK during the Roman period. It is worth noting that this particular study focused only on the incidence of the R1b-S28 haplotype. Caution should be exercised when drawing conclusions from the data (see my observation below about taking your research further)). The study was carried out by the company BritainsDNA. 

This was very different from the conservative American attitudes of the 1950s, and the effect was compounded by a report in Time magazine in 1955 by the American correspondent Joe David Brown. Brown's report was titled Sin and Sweden [NOTE: that the link is paywall-protected. I will try to find a freely available copy of the article] and apparently created the impression in the minds of many Americans that: 

EDIT: I've carried out some further searches today, and although I found found a number of other references to Robert Watson-Watt's report in secondary and tertiary sources, I wasn't able to find an online copy of the report itself. It is possible that it is still only available as hard-copy in official archives within the US. 

The failures seem to have been at all levels, but ultimately stemmed from the distribution of responsibility for planning and implementing an effective network. In hindsight, it is easy to see that there should have been a single authority with that responsibility. In reality, there wasn't. 

Although, as stated in the question (and discussed in my answer above), Plutarch still maintained that the Tribunes Mark Antony and Quintus Cassius Longinus joined Caesar before he crossed the Rubicon. Now Cicero was an enemy of Mark Antony (and of Caesar), but if he hoped his barbs would strike home, rumours of that sort would have had to already be current in Rome. The fact that Plutarch, writing a hundred years later, felt he had to counter Cicero's claim supports that idea. It therefore makes sense that when Caesar came to write his Civil Wars he would say that he met the Tribunes in Ariminum, whether or not he had already met them before he crossed the Rubicon. This neatly avoids any suggestion that his decision to bring his legion to Rome was provoked by the Senate's treatment of Mark Antony, or speculation about their relationship. Adrian Goldsworthy accepts Caesar's version (and so neatly also avoids the distraction I have described at length here). 

Yes, monasteries in the medieval period were in fact powerful lords of feudal estates. Most bishops and monasteries had large landholdings, which had been granted to them over the years by kings, or great lords. At one stage, the church was the largest landholder in Europe. The monastery at Luxeuil in Burgundy had enough land to support 15,000 manors. Another bishop of St Martin of Tours in France ruled something like 20,000 serfs. As with any other feudal landlord, the tenants of the monastery would owe rents and duties to their landlord (in addition to the tithes they owed to the church). 

Given that Greek was the lingua-franca of the Eastern Empire, and that (as we saw above) Zenobia had demonstrated a preference for using the Greek versions of her name and titles in inscriptions, it seems most likely that her associates and servants would have addressed her using the Greek "Sebaste" for Empress. However, given that she seems to have been trying to demonstrate degree of equality with the Emperor in Rome during the rebellion, it is also quite possible that she would have required her servants and associates to address her using the Latin title "Augusta". As we've seen, she certainly used that title on her coinage. 

We know from Suetonius that there had long been a claim that Julius Caesar had been King Nicomedes's catamite when was a boy. According to Suetonius, this charge was: 

Recent DNA Analysis In a series of papers from 2010 to 2015, Chunxiang Li of the College of Life Science, Ancient DNA Laboratory, and Research Center for Chinese Frontier Archaeology, at Jilin University, together with a number of colleagues, published a series of papers that presented the DNA evidence recovered from human remains from a large number of individuals from the Xiaohe cemetery complex. That complex dates from the Bronze Age, about 2000 BCE, and appears to have been in use for almost a millennium. In 2010, the authors were able to state that: 

If you are able to visit in person, or employ a researcher to visit on your behalf, you should be able to get a copy of the document. Various facilities are available on site. Even if the file is not suitable for photocopying, it is normally possible to take digital photographs of documents (indeed, a number of desks in the public reading rooms are fitted with camera stands to facilitate this).

As tensions grew between Britain and France in the run up to the Seven Years' War, more forts were constructed which, in a sense, consolidated the line of the border. Even so, there was never a formal acknowledgement of the precise line of the border. 

* Although there seems to be no doubt that a document by that name exists, I was unable to locate a copy of the report on the United Nations Official Document System search site (This may be because of the age of the report, or that it, together with associated documents, were classified Strictly Confidential when published, as shown in the Registry Section Summary (p711)). As a result, I cannot confirm that the report linked above is the actual report issued by the UN Committee. With that caveat, however, there does not seem to be anything in the content of the report to suggest that it is not genuine. 

Rome established a single empire with a single language, currency and laws. This doesn't mean that other languages didn't survive - and even thrive - alongside the official Latin of the Romans. In the Eastern Empire particularly, we know that Greek and (albeit to a lesser degree) the Egyptian and Aramaic languages continued to be in use. Most pre-Roman languages of the Western Empire weren't written languages (neither were the languages of the 'barbarian invaders' that replaced Rome in the West), so we have less evidence of how well they survived alongside vulgar Latin. That they did continue in use through the Roman period, however, is shown by the survival of the Welsh and Cornish languages for example. 

So, apart from the obvious humanitarian goals, the reasons for US economic aid to post-war Europe were essentially both strategic and economic. Firstly the strategic reasons, in the context of the early stages of the Cold War. The aim was to create stability in Western Europe, while undermining Soviet influence in the East. At the same time, American economic aid would help counter the perceived strength of Moscow-controlled communist parties in France and Italy. Secondly, the economic reasons. A prosperous Europe would be a growth market for American industries, promoting further growth at home. 

From what I've read, Clavell's portrayal of the Samurai culture in Japan is not too far from the reality. For example, this guidance from Uesugi Kenshin (1530-1578): 

Of course, it must be remembered that this was in the context of America's war against Japan in the Pacific and the build-up to D-Day in the European theatre.
