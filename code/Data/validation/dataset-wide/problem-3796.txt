It seems there exists such a thing: There is a spectral sequence by Anderson that computes the homology of the mapping space out of the cohomology of $M$ and the homology of $N$. Here is a link to the announcement: $URL$ I have not been able to find the subsequent paper with the proof. 

Let $M$ be a Riemannian manifold where closed balls are compact. Let $W\subset M$ be a submanifold of $M$ that is closed as a subset of $M$. Define the cut locus of $W$ in $M$ as $$\mathrm{Cut}(W;M)=\overline{\{x\in M\mid \exists y,z\in W,\text{with $y\neq z$ and } d(x,W) = d(x,y) = d(x,z)\}}$$ where the line denotes "closure". 

I haven't found an explicit reference in the literature, but as Johannes Ebert pointed to me, in the second part of Theorem 4 of R. Arens, Topologies for Homeomorphism Groups, American Journal of Mathematics, Vol. 68, No. 4 (Oct., 1946), pp. 593-610 it is proven that the inverse mapping $\mathrm{Homeo}(X)\to \mathrm{Homeo}(X)$ that sends a homeomorphism to its inverse is continuous with respect to the compact-open topology, provided that $X$ is Hausdorff, locally compact and locally connected. The same proof works as well to prove my question (under the assumptions that $X$ and $Y$ are Hausdorff, locally compact, and $Y$ is locally connected). Therefore I think that Arens article is a good reference for this fact (together with an indication saying that the proof has to be mildly adpated). This is how the adaptation would go: Theorem: If $X$ and $Y$ are Hausdorff locally compact spaces and $Y$ is locally connected, then the collapsing map $$\phi\colon \mathrm{OEmb}(X,Y)\longrightarrow \mathrm{map}(\overline{Y},\overline{X})$$ is continuous with the compact-open topologies. Proof: Take an embedding $e$ and consider a subbasic neighbourhood $(K,U)$ of $\phi(e)$, where $K\subset \overline{Y}$ is compact and $U\subset \overline{X}$ is open. Let us denote by $U^c$ the complement of $U$ in $X$ (not in $\overline{X}$). An embedding $f$ belongs to this neighbourhood if $\phi(e)(K)\subset U$, and this holds if and only if $e(U^c)\subset K^c$. Therefore $e(U^c)\subset K^c$ and if any other embedding $f$ satisfies that $f(U^c)\subset K^c$, then it holds that $\phi(f)\in (K,U)$. We distinguish two cases: \underline{If $\infty\in U$}, then $U^c$ is compact and we are done ($(U^c,K^c)$ is an open neighbourhood of $e$ that gets mapped into the neighbourhood $(K,U)$ of $\phi(e)$. \underline{If $\infty\notin U$}, then $K\subset e(X)$, and therefore $e^{-1}(K)$ is compact. This is the situation that Arens handles. We use that $X$ is Hausdorff locally compact to construct a pair of open neighbourhoods $V,W$ of $K$ with compact closure of $e$ such that $$e^{-1}(K)\in V\subset \overline{V}\subset W\subset \overline{W}\subset U.$$ Then $N:=\overline{W}\setminus V$ is compact, and if $f\in (N,K^c)$, then $\phi(f)(K)\subset N^c$. Observe that $N^c$ is the disjoint union of $V$ and $\overline{W}^c$. Now we use that $X$ is locally connected to assume, without loss of generality that $K$ is connected (this is detailed in Arens' paper). Therefore, if $f\in (N,K^c)$, then either $\phi(f)(K)\subset V\subset U$ (this is what we want) or $\phi(f)(K)\subset \overline{W}^c$. In order to rule out the second case, we make the additional assumption (again without loss of generality) that $K$ has non-void interior, then we take a point $p$ in the interior. If $f\in (N,K^c\cap e(W))\cap (\{e^{-1}(p)\},\mathring{K})$, then $f(e^{-1}(p))\subset K$, but then $e^{-1}(p)\in \phi(f)(K)\cap V$, which is non-empty, and therefore we have ruled out the second case and $f\in (K,V)\subset (K,U)$. 

My more general question is: Given a singular curve, or at least a prestable curve, what explicit information can we deduce about the dualizing sheaf? For example, is there a way to figure out what the dualizing sheaf looks like when restricted to an irreducible component, or at least a smooth irreducible component? 

The Mumford conjecture states that for each integer $n$, we have: the map $\mathbb{Q}[x_1,x_2,\dots] \to H^\ast(M_g ; \mathbb{Q})$ sending $x_i$ to the kappa class $\kappa_i$, is an isomorphism in degrees less than $n$, for sufficiently large $g$. Here $M_g$ denotes the moduli of genus $g$ curves, and the degree of $x_i$ is the degree of the kappa class $\kappa_i$. This conjecture was proved by Madsen-Weiss a few years ago. 

Try: Witten, Quantum field theory and the Jones polynomial Witten, The index of the Dirac operator in loop space I have found both of these papers quite difficult to understand. I don't know any easier references, and would greatly appreciate it if anybody could suggest some. Anyway, I guess the basic idea is very simple: Take a manifold, consider some space of "fields" on the manifold (for example a space of sections of a vector bundle), do "integrals" over this space of fields. The results should be invariants of your manifold --- this is not always true, but this is the idea or the hope, anyway. Edit: I want to also add that (T)QFT has applications not just to geometry/topology but also representation theory. For example check out these nice notes of David Ben-Zvi. 

I am wondering: Are there any general theorems or principles relating the theory of Z-graded dg objects and the theory of Z/2Z-graded dg objects? I am mainly interested in dg algebras, dg Lie algebras, and dg categories over fields of characteristic zero. 

Are people still using the second definition? If so, in which contexts, and why? What are the advantages of the second definition? 

There is a "folk theorem" (alternatively, a fun and easy exercise) which asserts that a 2D TQFT is the same as a commutative Frobenius algebra. Now, to every compact oriented manifold $X$ we can associate a natural Frobenius algebra, namely the cohomology ring $H^\ast(X)$ with the Poincare duality pairing. Thus to every compact oriented manifold $X$ we can associate a 2D TQFT. Is this a coincidence? Is there any reason we might have expected this TQFT to pop up? When $X$ is a compact symplectic manifold, perhaps the appearance of the Frobenius algebra can be explained by the fact that the quantum cohomology of $X$, which comes from the A-twisted sigma-model with target $X$, becomes the ordinary cohomology of $X$ upon passing to the "large volume limit". But for a general compact oriented $X$? I don't see how we might interpret the appearance of the Frobenius algebra in some quantum-field-theoretic way. Maybe there is an explanation via Morse homology?
