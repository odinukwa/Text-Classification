I am not sure how to derive the demand for consumption of today's bread; the first thing the problem asks for. I think it might be a piecewise function based on the interest rate that gets you from the price of today's to the price of tomorrow's, where depending on how high the interest rate is you either want strictly bread today or bread tomorrow. But like I'm said I'm not sure. So I would appreciate any help with this problem. Thanks! 

( The game of “ chicken”) Two cars are driving at each other at great speeds. If nobody changes directions, in 3 seconds they will collide and die a gruesome death, yielding payoffs of −100 for both players. At every second they have to (simultaneously) decide wether to continue or not (i.e. there are 3 periods to this game). Payoffs are as follows: If both players choose continue for each of the three periods, then they get −100. If at any period one player choses “not continue” and the other chooses “continue” the player that chose not to continue gets 0 and the other gets 100. If at some point both simultaneously choose not to continue they both get 0. True or False: Any equilibrium has the property that one of the players chooses not to continue, but this only happens in the last period (as in the movies!). I just wanted to double check my answer with someone. My answer: I think that the answer is false. Because the strategy profile where player 1 plays continue at every stage and player 2 plays not continue at every stage is a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium I believe? Because based on the one shot deviation principle, there is not point in the history where player 2 can deviate from this strategy at one node profitably. And (continue, not continue) is a Nash equilibrium for the individual game. Thus, this strategy would result in a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium without getting to the third stage of this game. 

A seller owns a single unit of an invisible good. It is worth $v(s)$ to a buyer, where $s ∈ R^+$ is the quality of the good. The function $v(·)$ is strictly increasing and strictly concave with $v(0) = 0$. Quality is chosen by the seller, and the cost of providing a good of quality $s$ is given by a function $c(s)$, which is strictly increasing and strictly convex with $c(0) = c '(0) = 0$ and $c'(0) < v'(0)$. (Implicit in this description is the assumption that the buyer’s preferences are quasilinear is some good other than the one being traded.) There are many parts to this question, but I'm most concerned about the step up. Which asks write down the first-order conditions to find the pareto optimal quality that maximizes the sum of the utilities and confirm that it is positive. I'm thinking that the utility functions are as follows: $u_B(x,s)=x+v(s)$ Where $x$ is dollars spent on anything besides the good that is being traded (like the composite commodity theorem) $u_S(s)=v(s)-c(s)$ The utility of the seller would just be the value they can sell the good for minus it's cost? Thus, $max_s(u_B+u_S)=v'(s)+v'(s)-c'(s)=0$ This results in the following equation: $2v'(s)=c'(s)$ Which doesn't make sense because of the assumptions of the first derivatives in the statement of the problem. So I'm not quite sure what I am doing wrong. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance! 

I think you are missing the credit risk attached to any loan. You, as an individual borrower, are far more likely not to reimburse your loan than a bank. Thus the loan is far less risky. Central bank money could only be qualified as "better" (even that does not mean much) because it is issued by the Central bank, deposits are issued by commercial bank, so you bear the risk that your bank fail, but it happens that in most country individual deposits are insured by some state agency. So I cannot really see why central bank money would be better than deposits. Nowadays, the amount of reserves that a bank must hold does not actually play a big role in the economy (as opposed to what most of economic textbooks and economic professors are teaching in undergrad schools). The most important part is the interest rate that is paid on those reserve, which is fixed by the central bank and which act as an opportunity cost for the bank when it decides to lend to an individual rather than holding reserves. However I see your point, but the fact is that this way of thinking is misleading. Banks create (in theory) as many loans as they want, because there are no physical constraints, if you want, that prevent them to do so. The only constraint is a regulatory constraint that states that in order to remain solvent (in order to be able to repay the depositors) banks should invest x% of the assets in reserves. Those reserves would be held on a central bank account in central bank money, and the return on those reserves will be the fed fund rate decided by the central bank (the same way a commercial bank decide how much interest it will pay on your savings account). So it is true that one more unit of reserves gives the right to issue more than one unit of loans but this does not mean that one money is better or worse than another. It's is just a matter of regulation. It may be hard to get, but the point is really that central bank money is safer so cheaper than deposits, no matter what regulatory constraints apply to banks. You may want to read this paper which may be a bit complicated but you should get the intuition. This two docs may be simpler (with nice pictures) : doc 1, doc 2. 

This does not work like that. If you want to add-up all the debt in the world you will not end-up with 0. Think about a situation in which I owe you \$100, you owe someone else \$100, and this someone else owe me \$100. Total debt would be \$300, even if another guy is debt-free. Moreover, country debt (called sovereign debt) is not only owned by other countries but most of the world-debt, is owned by people, mostly through pension funds (and other investments). So even in a single-country economy, the country may issue some debt that consumers or firms can invest in. And the global amount of sovereign debt will be strictly positive. Again most of the world-debt is privately owned and it may even be the case that those five countries you're talking about don't hold a single debt contract.
