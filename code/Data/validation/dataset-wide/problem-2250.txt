According to the Hockey Hall of Fame, the Boston Bruins began play in 1924. According to the UCLA Alumni Association (click Mascot), UCLA adopted the Bruin as their mascot in 1926, having been previously known as the Cubs (1919) and the Grizzlies (1924). The Cubs were selected as the original mascot because the university was orginally the Southern Branch of UC Berkeley, who were known as the Bears. (The bear was well established as a symbol of the state of California and appears on the state flag.) They apparently switched to Grizzlies to try to get from under the shadow of Berkeley while retaining the "bear" imagery. In 1926, when UCLA joined the Pacific Coast Conference, the University of Montana was already the Grizzlies, so UCLA changed to the Bruins - yet another word for "bear". It's possible they were influenced by the name of the Boston hockey team, but it also could be simply a logical progression. I don't think the term "bruin" for a bear (coming from Dutch, I believe) is so obscure as to make it improbable that two organizations could independently select it. 

Assume current MLB rules. References to authoritative sources would be preferred if possible. I couldn't find this situation addressed in the Official Rules. 

In the case of Aguero, Cristiano Ronaldo, Bojan and Muniain, yes, they turned pro as minors, but there was no problem with FIFA because they all were signed by and played for clubs in the countries they were residing in. FIFA only regulates the transfer of minors to countries outside their domicile. In the case of Messi, Barcelona agreed to relocate his entire family from Argentina to Spain, thus staying within the regulations. As to how the players were paid when they were minors, that would depend on the laws for employment of minors in the respective countries. In the case of the transfer bans handed to Atletico de Madrid, Real Madrid (and previously Barcelona), the clubs were found guilty of breaching the aforementioned transfer regulations by FIFA. Atletico and Real can appeal the bans with FIFA (and then with Court of Arbitration for Sport, if the previous appeal is turned down). 

This rule is just for NBA and WNBA. NCAA and FIBA rules state the team must continue to play with 4 players. 

Now it's up to the referee's discretion as to whether the offence falls within any of the above categories. 

If the referee stops play while the ball is still in play (for an injury or a pitch invasion or any other reason), play is restarted with a dropped ball. FIFA Laws of the Game 2015/16 Law 8: Start and Restart of Play 

In attempting to field a foul popup, a fielder leans over the railing of his own dugout. Suppose his teammates and/or coaches in the dugout support him with their hands, to keep him from falling over the railing, and he makes the catch. Is this legal? If not, is there any penalty other than considering the catch not to have been made (making it just a foul ball)? Rule 6.01(b) says that the team at bat must get out of the way of a fielder trying to catch a ball, even in their own dugout; and if they hinder the fielder, the batter can be called out. But I didn't see any rule that applies to the fielder's own teammates. 

Is it possible to appeal a tag-up play at a base after a pitching change? If so, how does it affect the pitchers' statistics? For a concrete example, suppose P1 is pitching, runner R3 at third, one out. Batter B hits a fly ball which is caught by the left fielder (two out). Runner R3 advances to home. Now pitcher P1 is removed and replaced with P2. After the pitching change, but before P2 pitches to the next batter, the defense realizes that R3 left third before the fly ball was caught. P2 throws to third to appeal. 

As @Don_Biglia mentioned, there's no way of knowing what a manager writes on his notepad. But some intelligent guesswork would suggest he/she is keeping a note of certain points about the game. It could be anything from a list of things to say at half time to individual advice to be given to certain players. Of course for all we know he/she could just be doodling as well, probably a technique to keep oneself calm. Many managers do not write anything, leaving that job to one of his/her assistants. Basically, it's up to the individual manager to do what he/she wants during a match, as long as he/she stays within the technical area and does not engage in any unsportsmanlike behaviour. 

If the referee feels he did not have a clear view of the ball, he can refer to the assistant referee, who will give him his opinion in whether it is a goal or not. The referee does not have to go by the advice given to him by his assistant, but generally does so. Once he has given his decision, if the players are still arguing beyond reason, he may book them. UEFA has introduced two additional referees into the game, in their tournaments (Champions League, Europa League, EURO, etc), to assist in these kinds of decisions. These additional referees are positioned behind the goal line, beside each goal. Again, the main referee is under no obligation to give the same decision advised to him by the additional referee. The decision made by the main referee in this regard is final and binding upon the game. See FIFA Laws of the Game 2015/16, page 61 onwards, . 

I tried searching and found a few mentions of games won on the last at-bat, but couldn't find a precise definition. 

Adrian Gonzalez of the Los Angeles Dodgers has now hit 5 home runs in the first 3 games of the 2015 season. Is this a major league record for most home runs in the first 3 games of a season? In general, is there somewhere I can find records for most home runs in the first n games of a season, for various values of n? 

Many of Major League Baseball's annual player awards are awarded to two players, one each in the American and National Leagues. (For instance, MVP, Cy Young, Silver Slugger, Rookie of the Year, etc.) If a player plays in both leagues in a single season (perhaps due to a midseason trade), how is it determined which league's awards he is eligible for? Is it based on games played, days under contract, his affiliation as of a certain date, or something else? If such a player turns out to be eligible for one league's award, can his performance in the other league be considered towards the award? (I realize some of these awards are selected by different organizations which may have different rules, but it would be nice to know about as many as possible.) 

Apart from this, all umpires receive ₹750 as daily allowance, ₹600 as conveyance allowance, and free hotel accommodation. To see the salaries of umpires part of the ICC International Panel see this article. 

The player can put in a transfer request. But the club is under no obligation to let him go. The player must either attempt to patch things up with the management or be resigned to sitting on the sidelines. In this situation, generally, a player good enough to be in the first team would like to have as much playing time as possible. A recent example would be Saido Berahino with West Bromwich Albion. He put in an official transfer request. But the club refused to let him go. They rejected all the transfer offers they recieved for Berahino. He plays for the club in the Barclays Premier League right now, but he is not a regular first team starter, generally coming on as a substitute. 

The role of a runner is a replacement for the injured batsman. In the interest of fairness to the fielding side, the runner must wear all the external protective equipment worn by the batsman he is running for, and must carry a bat. This is obsolete now. Runners have been abolished from all forms of international cricket. 

Why the break with tradition? Was there a rule change, or simply managers deciding to dress differently for some reason? 

It occasionally happens that a pitcher will earn a save by throwing one pitch. For example, he is brought in with two outs in the ninth and a two-run lead, and his first pitch is popped up. In principle, it should be possible for a pitcher to earn a save without throwing a pitch at all. For instance, he could pick off a runner. We could also imagine more exotic situations: a runner abandons the base paths, or the batter attempts to use an illegal bat. Has this ever happened? Instances in MLB would be most interesting, but other leagues would be interesting also. In this forum post someone suggested that Mitch Williams did this in 1989 or 1990. It looks like they are thinking of September 11, 1989, where according to the box score, Williams did earn a one-out save by picking off a runner. But unfortunately, it appears he threw one pitch to the batter first (a ball). 

On a baseball broadcast tonight, the team statistic "wins in last at-bat" came up. What's the definition of this term? The announcer was careful to point out that such a win "doesn't have to be a walk-off", and gave as an example San Francisco at Milwaukee, June 8, 2017. This was an extra-innings game in which the visiting Giants scored four runs in the top of the 10th, then held the Brewers scoreless in the bottom of the 10th to win. But the Giants' last at-bat in the top of the 10th didn't score a run at all (it was a ground ball into a double play) so it's not clear to me in what sense they won on their last at-bat. If it helps, there was a graphic showing the National League leaders for most wins in last at-bat in the 2017 season up to June 9: 

Actually, the boundary is restored every time it has been displaced by a fielder (or any other agent). You never see it happening because the broadcasting companies never end up showing it. This is largely due to the fact that there is always something more interesting to show than the replacing of the boundary ropes. As you rightly mentioned, even a few centimetres seems to make quite a difference in cricket today, and hence the restoring of the boundary rope to its original position is very important. Next time you go to a stadium to watch a cricket match, observe the boundary rope after it has been displaced (for whatever reason). You will notice someone (ball boy/ substitute player/ stadium official) will restore the boundary rope to its original position. (NOTE: This might cause you to miss out on some cricketing action happening around the pitch). 

NOTE: I know the question asked was not exactly about the Advantage rule. I felt it was required to provide a little extra information for anyone else reading the answer. 

However, being a main referee in one competition does not guarantee the same position in another competition. For example, an Indian referee can be on-field for India's premier football league, I-league, but might have to settle for being an assistant referee if he/she is called up by FIFA to referee in an international tournament. Also, many major tournaments have a fourth referee, one who takes care of substitutions and other duties in the technical area. This referee is one who holds the position of on-field referee. He/she may be called to step in for any of the referees (on-field/assistant) in case something were to happen to the latter. Hence, a referee must know both, the on-field and assistant duties, at all times. 

I believe that for many years, MLB managers would always wear the same uniform as their players during games. However, I've been watching more games on TV this year, and it seems that many managers now wear other clothing. For example, in this photo from May 9, 2015 (credit David Richard of USA Today), we see Cleveland manager Terry Francona making a visit to the mound. The shirt he's wearing is completely different from his player's uniforms, and it doesn't look like he has a uniform jersey underneath. 

Under the NFL's current "modified sudden death" overtime rules, if the first team scores a field goal, the second team is entitled to one more possession. What happens if the clock runs out during that possession? Suppose the score is tied 20-20 at the end of the 4th quarter. Team A wins the overtime coin toss and receives the kickoff to begin overtime. After a long slow drive, Team A scores a field goal to make the score 23-20. Now they kick off to Team B. Team B is not able to score, and the overtime period ends with Team B still in possession. What happens? Rule 16 is not very explicit on this point. Article 4 (a) says: 

Technically football officials don't record 'misses'. Only statisticians do so. There is no definition of a 'penalty miss' in FIFA's Laws of the Game. (I'm mentioning this since you have tagged ) The goalscorers in games in major tournaments (like Spanish La Liga, English Premier League, UEFA Champions League, FIFA World Cup, etc.) are recorded during the match by the match commissioner. The competition organizers then keep tally, for awards like top scorer and best player which are given at the end of the competition. In this case, the Royal Spanish Football Federation would add the goal to Luis Suarez's tally, while Lionel Messi would be credited with the assist (which most federations keep tally of as well). But again, there is no record of any penalty (or any other kind of) misses. Statistics companies do keep track of penalty misses and various other statistics for informational purposes and I suppose this would count as a miss as mentioned by Oak in the comments to your question. As to whether this is allowed, FIFA Laws of the Game 2015/16 state: 

Just another sport apart from the ones Philip Kendall mentioned, is cricket. While the outfield has to be of grass, the pitch can be of varied types. The condition of the pitch can vary from a green top to a completely dry,dusty surface. Like tennis, the different conditions of the pitches will suit different players/teams. The various types of pitches include: (non-exhaustive)
