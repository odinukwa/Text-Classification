Violet is your best bet for the strongest wavelengths because a plant that absorbs lots of violet light will appear more yellow. If we focused instead on the green part of the spectrum (where chlorophyll is weakest), the plant would look more red. The increased violet light might make your sky appear more indigo than Earth's pale blue, but atmospheric color is going to depend hugely on what gasses are present and in what concentrations. Oxygen and nitrogen are pretty good at scattering violet light, but our sun doesn't emit enough of it for our sky to appear more violet. So you can probably achieve this effect simply by making the star emit a little more violet light. I'm treading on the limits of what I know here, but you can probably do this by either by changing it mass to be heavier or just changing its chemical composition (its spectral signature). If more violet light is being scattered by the atmosphere, the sun itself might appear a little more orange than it does on Earth. Regardless, sunlight would still be white light just like it is on Earth, and things on the surface wouldn't be colored differently. 

Companies can adopt a reputation scheme as follows. Near the start-up, companies will strive to produce the best product their resources will allow, squeezing every last ounce of quality into them. Meanwhile, messengers are sent all around the known world spreading news about the "amazing X company" and of course provide accessibility to the products. If the company manages to catch on, their fame will rapidly skyrocket their product quality, but in turn they wont need to even try to improve any further. Companies will gain undefeatable monopolies. 

Almost all well explored abilities can, with a little creativity, have semi-believable disadvantages just slapped on. Unfortunately, most of the more flamboyant abilities (various kinesis types, shape-shifting), have very powerful advantages and would require even more devastating measures for balance. For most, throwing fireballs is totally worth it for lethargy afterwards. For example: The good: Light telepathy, allowing only for generalized mind reading (like sensing aggravation or lie detection) but nothing as complex as stealing specific thoughts or memories. The bad: Reading someones mind (as described above) takes focus and short range (5-10m) line of sight. Further, all stress, anxiety and likewise conditions of others nearby accumulate on the reader, obviously causing mental instability on most users. 

This system has a few problems of its own however. Inheritance becomes a bit messy; based on the above system, a type 1 and a type 4 could have either type 1 or type 4 children, but a type 1 and a type 3 would always have type 5 children, and a type 5 and a type 6 could have either type 3, type 4, type 5, or type 6 children. Also, it's difficult to justify why one particular combination would be non-magical but all other combinations were of equal strength. We can't just make allele C nonfunctional, because then there'd be no difference between types 1 and 5 and between types 2 and 6. You could get around this by making allele C be unable to function on its own, making type 3 non-magical, but to change the effect of allele A or B if its also present. This is perfectly biologically valid, but it still ties types 1 and 5 and types 2 and together somewhat. So this is now getting into the realm of exactly what these types of magic are, how they relate to each other and what common features they might have. An alternative explanation could be that two of the alleles, say A and B, have "opposite" effects that cancel each other out. Maybe the A and B enzymes recognize each other as foreign and try to consume each other, but don't mind themselves (obviously) and are okay with enzyme C. Or maybe the molecules they produce destructively react together (imagine if A gives you magic through the power of baking soda, C through the power of water, and B through the power of vinegar. Stupid example but hopefully it makes my point). This would be very similar to how blood type works, as discussed in John's answer. It doesn't have to be one gene, however. There could be two genes essential for magic, or three, or six. There are many increasingly complex ways this could work. I'll write more if I think of any that are particularly interesting. 

I believe this implies that answers should address how the AI manages internal infrastructure meaning that humans will, at least in the beginning, manage military affairs, international relations, and other matters that directly effect the economy less immediately, as self-sustenance is a future sub-goal. Short term goal Making everyone happy is impossible, but being an AI it will likely try to maximize human happiness, leading to a myriad of secondary goals. 

Magical ability can simply be mapped to a square root function. More emotion added does not mean an equal addition in power. Instead, the difficulty in increasing power raises with the power, tapering off eventually. Where this tapering happens is based on whatever you would like to use (different for each person, random, etc). The second limitation is in context. There are multiple types of situations we would prefer aren't magically amped-up, like 5-year old tantrums or adolescent blowups. A number of solutions are possible. Maybe magic increases with age or maturity, it may even be blocked by hormones. :) Alternatively just leave the one rule how it is. Instead of modifying the rule, modify society. Who needs cars when you can get angry and run 80 kph. Even tools are useless to a degree as beating your head against a wall actually might smash the wall. 

Is this setup a feasible explanation for the seasons of a fictional planet? If so, how would the planet's seasonal cycle differ from Earth's (all other things being equal)? 

The Greek Gods were more than humans with an immortality gene: they could shape shift, control nature, and generally do "supernatural" things like give birth from their skulls after swallowing the mother. So I don't think it's realistic to attribute their immortality to a gene, or even to any kind of biology; they're clearly made of "god stuff" beyond the ken of modern science. Indeed, for a god even to impregnate a human woman, he must first change his shape to appear human. If a human were to merely look upon a god in their true form, the human would be destroyed. So the children of gods are mortal simply because in order for a god to impregnate a human woman, he must first adopt a human visage and take human form. Then, the child grows in a human womb where they are nourished by human blood and earthly nutrients. Their body is built from human proteins, not "god stuff." This of course assumes that the the father is the god and the mother is an Earth woman. If the sexual roles were flipped, the child might very well end up being immortal! Assuming that earthly sperm would even have any effect on a godly ovum. 

Genetic control The first matter to deal with is to ask what level of genetic modification is possible. If we are limited by standards slightly more advanced than today's, then we have a few options. We can.. Reduce or remove the production of certain catecholamines, deflating some riot situations. Reduce or remove the production of serotonin, causing memory loss. (What was i angry about?) Modifying the image of a "perfect being." More specifically, giving a genetic bias towards a certain leader figure. Studies have shown that completely irrelevant genetic traits have contributed to public image. So what if the perfect match happens to be the current ship captain. Kind of genetic There is the ability to genetically hamper the supply of insulin to artificially administer diabetes. This could very quickly nip rebellions in the bud if the only insulin supplies are located at secure nodes. In the same way, albeit somewhat less cruel, get everyone on a certain drug and watch as rebellions struggle through withdrawal before crawling back in surrender. (Never mind, just as cruel) Other Rather than using genetics (a recipe for some resistant hero to arrive), use neuroscience. As soon as someone gives birth, transport the newborn to a government approved "educational" site, guaranteed to improve IQ by looks in PR folder 20%. What is actually happening is basic conditioning. While curbing any rebellious thoughts for the next 2-3 years, the young will be fed direct associations between rebellion and pain, and conversely be given compliance and reward. As an added bonus, anyone audacious enough to not put their newborn through this liberating process will have the child labeled as being in possession of a lower intelligence. 

Consider the hormone Norepinephrine. On Earth, this chemical is produced by as part of the "fight-or-flight" response, that is, when an animal is panicking, anxious, or generally high strung. If your creature evolved separately, it might have a completely different use for the molecule. Instead of making the creature anxious, maybe it acts like an enjoyable drug, or maybe it serves as an essential micronutrient, like a vitamin. It could even be an aphrodisiac. Regardless, it's a chemical your creatures want. In order to actually get the Norepinephrine, the creature would have to induce great stress in a person (most easily by scaring them) and then extract the Norepinephrine from their bodies. They could act like leeches, secreting an anesthetic from their jaws and silently filtering it from the bloodstream, or they could violently rip out the person's adrenal glands (where the hormone is produced)--whatever's to your story's best interests. Unfortunately, it's not scientifically plausible for them to feed* off of the actual emotional state of fear, since that feeling is quite literally all in your head. It would have to be a chemical mechanism. Going straight for the hormone seems like your best bet, although there is some tentative evidence that emotional signals can be chemically imprinted in human sweat. *For commonly accepted definitions of "feed". 

Specifically, what is the exact principle that allows a rain dance to work, but not magical pumpkins. Certainly rain is more plausible, but unless magic is a sentient being capable of understanding plausibility... 

So it looks like you have a very dangerous slime bacteria. Unfortunately, the blob's existence would not necessarily lead to mass extinction. Assuming these blobs can starve, they will likely fall into a predator/prey cycle. 

Almost definitely not. The sheer amount of energy required to lift an object of this magnitude would be far out of its capabilities. The only plausible escape of gravity would be partial, meaning it would be trivial to fling small pieces of the blob out of the planet's gravity well provided the blob is intelligent enough to even do that. These projectiles would be unguided and not likely land anywhere suitable to consume or reproduce. 

And so many more. But who cares about what they did add to science, we want to know what they can add to science, and there are different criteria measuring that. We want people who... Died before they could release a truly major contribution to the public. Have important knowledge that was lost in the past. (Library of Alexandria, Pompeii, Advanced Art of Memory techniques) Have highly adaptable minds so that they don't freak out when they suddenly pop into existence. Those fitting at least some of these new criteria are.
