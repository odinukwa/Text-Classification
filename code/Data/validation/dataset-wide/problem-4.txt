Reality check??? The premise of the question is totally divorced from reality. There is no reason whatsoever to stop the spaceship in the middle of nowhere to "have lunch". Assuming the aliens craft operates on known physics, it will take a huge amount of fuel to accelerate or decelerate to the relativistic speeds required to go anywhere quickly. Why would you waste fuel by stopping and starting up again? If the aliens don't want to be crushed with huge g forces then accelerating or decelerating to those sort of speeds will take months. And NO a small lump of rock, floating in a gas cloud with many others could not possibly create a star, unless you are considering the butterfly effect, in which case it will collapse into a star as if it was going to happen anyway, and the effect is just as likely to stop a star forming. (in the same way that you breathing now could cause or stop a hurricane next year because the weather is very sensitive to tiny changes, but without vast computers and data on every air current across the world there is no way of telling what would have happened otherwise.) The vast plume of hot exhaust gas could perhaps trigger star formation to happen slightly differently but I would need data on the engine and gas cloud to calculate that.(only of you have a large ship), Heat more likely to stop gas cloud collapsing. 

Cyber Attack The martians have limited options for any sort of attack. If they can hack really well and can tamper with an important digital system then they could get earth to agree a favorable truce. (There is malware in all your power stations, send these supplies or they all turn off.) This only works if sending the supplies is preferable to fixing the problem. Those on earth probably wipe or replace the hacked computers. Only works until someone unplugs the radio dish on earth. Rockets If they have a return rocket they could crash land it on earth. This is pretty stupid as it means they're stuck on mars. Better to return to earth. Hard to aim well, earth is protected by its atmosphere. Earth has time to hack it, shoot it off course with their own rockets or jam its signal. Enthusiasts Probably the most effective would be to whip up a crowd of people on earth who are furious at the governments stance on the issue. May include family and friends who feel they have been abandoned on mars. Could happen without the martians help. Will not be stopped by turning off communication. Works best if you have not used other techniques. Earths Attack The martians probably still rely on small, hard to manufacture devices from earth, like spacesuit parts, or computer chips. The martian colony is unlikely to be producing anything other than scientific data that earth can't make its self. If earth stops sending supplies then the martians can probably do nothing, waiting until something breaks and they die. All earth has to do is stop sending supplies. Crash landing rockets and cyber attacks will work as well for earth, and they can muster more rockets, mars has less atmosphere and less opportunity for evacuation or defense. 

The Union win hands down by sheer scale. The "gods" are powerful but there are too few to make any difference. The power transfers to someone else when they die, but how long does it take to find that person and train them? Do they accidentally blow up a city because they were lighting a fire magically when the powers kicked in. Keeping a god injured and trapped may take a lot of resources but there aren't many of them. Teleportation is fast but the quantities that can be transported are tiny and you can't hit an enemy ship because you can't see them. (until they are very nearby) The union can surround the planet with huge swarms of autonomous satellites. The totally winning solution is to modify algae to produce something super-toxic and release it. Then with a dead but habitable planet you release something that destroys the first algae and removes the toxin. Then bring plants you want to have. (You have to wipe the biosphere anyway as it wouldn't be compatible with your biology. ) How did the Parthenon set up civilization as a long distance teleport almost guarantees a suffocation? Even if they landed on a planet, the chances of it having a breathable atmosphere is tiny. (and they would probably appear moving at km/s because of different orbits) Granting them that fluke, you are now on an unknown, alien world with few resources and no idea what to do. Given that planets move, and that you have no way to make measurements or do calculations, how do you get home, how do you show your friends the planet? (if you make a portal then they could still be moving very fast and you wipe out a whole city when you open a portal to a star) How do you set up a thriving civilization without any crops? Do you try to wipe out the indigenous life and plant your own, or taste all the plants to see which are poisonous? Actually how come they weren't wiped out when one of the gods turned out to be a nutter? 

A surprisingly large amount of over engineering has been proposed. Do armies destroy a mountain that the enemy has camped on or just the camp? Warfare tends to follow the principle of using no more than necessary? Why destroy the star when you can make the planet just as uninhabitable with a few nukes or an asteroid strike? Some of the consequences are hopelessly naive. If you move a star from your enemies planet and they are incapable of moving the planet, moving to another planet, moving to a space station or setting up a fusion reactor and swarm of lights in orbit, then you are far more technologically advanced and you cannot hope to win. (unless your attacks use 1000 000 times more energy than it takes them to stop the attack) Why are they fighting, for habitable planets, whats habitable to one alien species may not be to another. Why don't they grab an asteroid and live in space colonies? The asteroid belt provides enough raw materials to make 1000's of times the earths area in space habitats, no implausible physics required and everything you can get on a planet can be easily provided. (The ISS already has many of the features, with spinning for gravity and radiation shielding just being slightly too heavy0 

There are other things you can do in the Sahara. If you focus on using local materials and keeping costs down then you should... Build solar furnaces to melt the sand into low grade glass. (smelt out oars as well?) build enormous greenhouses that are watered with simple evaporation based systems. Sell dried fruit and veg. 

Bob makes a portal between the underground lake and deep beneath the Sun's surface. The force of a nuclear explosion is contained by the rock as high pressure plasma rushes through. The lake is heated to boiling. Several of the worlds largest power stations sit above the lake, generating a majority of the worlds electricity. Bob makes a portal three times a day and is immensely rich. He has also sent a lot of space probes across the solar system and beyond. 

Gravitation on the surface scales linearly with radius and density. The earth has a radius of 6,400 km and a density ~ 5g/cm3. Irridium and osmium have densities about 20g/cm3, thats 4 times earths density. Therefore the radius of the sphere is 1/4 that of earth to produce normal gravity. 1,600km radius ball of osmium might be hard to find. If you want 80% gravity then 1,600*80%=1,300km radius. 4/3*Pi*r^3 tels us that the volume is 9.2 billion cubic km and as 1 billion cubic m is 1 cubic km and 1 cubic m weighs 20 tonnes. The volume is 9.2 billion billion m^3 and the density 20 million g/m^3. That gives a weight of 184 million billion billion gram's. Iridium costs £10 per gram and osmium £5 per gram. (ballpark) This makes the project cost in the region of £1 billion billion billion or £10^27. With a world gdp of £50 thousand billion this project could be paid for in 20 thousand billion years(assuming all funds are devoted to it and osmium prices and gdp remain constant) About when the last stars are dying out. 

You don't. At most you scoop off the atmosphere and biosphere, soil, some oceans... One rocky core is much like another but it contains most of the mass. If sending the planet interstellar expect million year transit times and a very cold planet. (this is if you want more than a ball of molten rock.) 

What you need is an orbital ring. A solid ring of matter that is stationary to the earth, magnetically levitated above an orbiting wire. With cables from it to the ground. $URL$ Using these and magnetic acceleration, you can launch payloads for a reasonable amount of electricity, and regain most of that energy when they return. If you are mining asteroids, this could be net positive in electricity. 

Some Random Person 2000 years ago Due to the nature of the butterfly effect their does not need to be a single neat story explaining how the change happened. The real difference will be made with a long series of coincidences and knock on effects. A month after you make any change to the past, however tiny, the weather will be completely different. This has a knock on effect of who dies in famines and who was never born. History branches off with a multitude of forgotten details causing unforeseeable consequences. The further back in time you go the more history could diverge. Their will be someone, some when that shooting will bring about almost any future, but a nanosecond difference in timing and the results could be completely different. By shooting the right person at the right time (or making any action that changes earth 2000 years ago) you can get anything from all humans going extinct to a world where the dark ages never happened and tech is 1000 years more advanced. Then again you have no way of knowing the effect of your actions without running an extremely realistic simulation. 

The strain observed in the $URL$ is a maximum of 10^-21. Assuming that a displacement of 10^-3 ( a 1m long object gets made 1mm longer) and that the strain is inversely proportional to distance, then the event would need to be 10^18 times closer to be noticeable. As the original signal was 3 billion light years away and a light year is 10^16 m then the max noticeable distance is 3*10-9 ly =3*10^7m under a tenth of the distance to the moon. 

If they can create another moon then clearly they are far more advanced then us and are just showing off. As this moon is far larger than asteroids try moving the asteroids to protect earth. Given the mass of the moon and earths oceans, may I suggest removing the oceans, scooping fish off the sea floor, and returning the oceans? (If you want to help fishermen get them a new boat or something.) Power on this scale could be easily used to fix major problems, it seems to be being squandered on something with no particular purpose. The only scenario where earth gets another moon is if a large collection of minerals (asteroids, mars rock ...) are being placed near earth as a stockpile or slag heap. In other huge actions done for the sake of tiny benefits, try setting off a nuke across town to melt the snow off your car. 

For fun People still knit despite machine knitting being far faster because they enjoy it. Like many kinds of art and hobbies, people will make things and do things because they want to. Science used to be done by rich lords who could afford to do nothing if they wanted to but were curious about how the world worked. Humans will play while machines do all the hard or unpleasant work. Look at how those on holiday behave, or those rich enough to pay others to do menial work. This will mean lots of people doing nothing, but quite a few doing art and some inventing things. (if the AI is really smarter than humans it will be better at inventing, but people will pursue science and invention for the fun of it anyway.) You wouldn't have anyone fighting in combat because doing so is unpleasant and dangerous. With this sort of tech you will easily be able to provide all humans with plenty and luxury. (this is why we are getting less violent, a starving man will risk death in war for a little food but a better of person will not and we are getting richer) You will have plenty of people playing ultra realistic VR fighting games and real life, fake fight games like paintball or lasertag.
