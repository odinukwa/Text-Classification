This is a fair ball, the ball never touches foul territory, so therefore it can't be a foul ball. MLB Rules State: 

It's called "Eye Black". It is used under the eyes of athletes to help reduce the glare of the sun and it does improve an athlete's ability to differentiate between light and dark, making it easier for a player to track moving objects in a bright environment. 

Here is an actual example of a squib kick so people get the gist of what the procedure is, and why it happens. $URL$ 

According to this list of fines and suspensions, if I counted correctly, there have been 36 fines handed out for flopping, but no suspensions. 

From my experience and reading, it doesn't seem like many "spontaneous" plays are made up during the course of a game, at least in most situations. A coach sits down with his playbook, and film of the other team, and narrows his playlist down to a certain number of plays he thinks will work against said team. He then sits down with his Quarterback and various coaches and goes through what they think will work, and narrow the list down further. Now obviously there are going to be variations of plays called, like the same play can be run from any set(ie: single back set, i formation, spread, etc.) and there will also be variations on the actual plays, like a WR going right instead of left on a given play depending on the tendency of the other teams defense, etc. A coaches gameplan is very particular and they usually hash out everything before the game, as it'd be tough to just draw up a random play and have all the players understand it and make it work on the fly. The play's the coach draws up for any given game are usually run quite a bit in practice the week before the game. Here is a small article that kind of explains what goes into planning for a particular game. Doesn't say anything about making plays up on the fly, but it will give you specifics on what goes on during gameplanning in general. 

If you have identified your ideal heart rate for the distance you are running, and use a monitor in training then it makes sense to use it in a race - it helps you to keep from getting caught up in the race spirit and pushing too hard (especially useful in longer distance runs) I used to just use my feeling and a known running cadence, which worked for most marathons, but for my last Paris Marathon I got over excited early on and ruined my time by overdoing it. Since then I would swear by a monitor. 

The generally accepted solution is to accept that this will happen - you can minimise the risk by kicking the board backward when you bail, but most skaters would rather damage the board than accidentally get hooked up with a leash in traffic, or trip on the leash when trying to bail at speed etc. Boards are meant to take dings anyway. That said, there are some situations when you might want one, so you can use a leash (a little like a surfer's leash, but tightly coiled so it won't go under the trucks, hopefully) but you will look silly and will get harassed by other skaters :-) There was someone who invented a 'dead man's brake' that would stop a longboard quite quickly if your foot came off it, but it didn't catch on. 

No matter what fins you use, your arm position should never be such that your freestyle recovery is in the water. If the bow wave is high for you, rotate your shoulders more and raise your elbow higher. Your coach should be pointing this out to you. If you are raising your arms, you don't want to be pressing your chest and head down. You may wish to discontinue use of fins, or possibly switch to shorter fins (as per @Phil's comment) in order to focus on your arm stroke. 

So let's say, for the sake of the question, that the player being traded is Clayton Kershaw. Situation: Kershaw is selected as the NL's starter in the All Star Game. Couple of days before the All Star Game, the Dodgers shock the nation and trade Kershaw to the Yankees. Question: Does Kershaw still start for the NL? Does he start for the AL? Does he not start, but still play for the AL? What happens in this situation, in terms of him and his All Star Status? 

Absolutely they can. Many players play multiple positions. Most common is probably guys who play both Running Back and Wide Receiver(Example being Dexter McCluster - Tennesee Titans). Granted I'm guessing you're probably looking more for guys who play on offense and defense in the same game or at least the same season. One notable guy who has played both offense and defense is Mike Vrabel who was a career linebacker, but lined up on the offensive side of the ball multiple times, with a career 14 targets in the passing game, 10 receptions, all 10 going for Touchdowns. Multiple times have offensive linemen lined up as Full Backs or Tight Ends. JJ Watt has caught multiple touchdown passes in his short career. Now will we see a player line up on both sides of the ball on a consistent basis, game in and game out, probably not too often. It would probably lead to the player tiring out too quickly and not being as effective. But yes, a player can play multiple positions in the same game. 

The point counts. But it is a fault. Hence, the point is awarded to your opponent. See 13.3.8. However, be award that if the shuttle first hits the head and then the stringed area, it is NOT a fault and therefore a legal shot. 

I would like to add some more insights to the answer that was already given. Gaining match practice as a reason to enter as a qualifier First, I would like to mention that forgetting to sign in for a tournament on-time is only one reason for top seeds (in the main draw) who play qualifications. There is also another reason: Players sometimes do this on purpose if they want to gain match practice, that is, they want to play as many matches as possible. For example, in 2016 Dennis Novak played 4 Futures (more or less) back to back and in each he played qualifications, despite the fact that he would have been top seed in the main draw. I think the excuse that he didn't sign up in time, is not valid in this case. Here are the draws: 

Entrance as a WC into qualies I would also like to stress, that only in Tunisia F14 Futures, Dennis received a Wild Card into the qualifications. For all three other tournaments he entered as a normal player (without a Wild Card). I am not sure why he needed (?) a Wild Card to play the qualies of Tunisia F14 Futures, because there is also the option to be on-site at the qualifications deadline. In that case (irrespective of your ranking) you can play qualies. After reading the rulebook section regarding entrance into qualifying draws, I am pretty sure that entering via Wild Card is done, when there is the possibility that the Qualifying Draw will be full with regular players. In this case, a top seed player, who wants to play qualificiations, can only play qualifications with a Wild Card. If the player can be 100% sure that the qualifications draw will NOT be full, he does not need a Wild Card and can enter the qualifications draw as a so called On-Site Alternate. Top-Seed plays qualies and main draw is already done Another thing I would like to note is that usually, if a top-seed, who would be (top) seeded in the main draw, plays qualies, the Main Draw is not made until the qualies are finished. The reason for this is, that the top-seeded qualies player will then be also the top seed in the main draw. However sometimes, the Main Draw is already made before the qualifications are finished. In this case, the person, who would have been the top seed in the main draw, if the organizers would have waited until the qualifications are finished, will just be a regular qualifier. There is a valid chance, that this regular qualifier will play a seed in the first round of the tournament (which is stupid, if you ask me). This case will likely happen this week in the Italy F9 Futures (draw), where Stefanos Tsitsipas (ATP #198) is currently playing qualies, but the Main Draw has already been made. Let's see who he will face in the Main Draw (if he successfully qualifies).

When I was competing at school I built my own one, and the end result not only felt just like one of the better ones I could buy, it cost me about the same. It also took me a lot of time and effort to ensure the layers were correctly affixed and smoothed. This is a very small statistical sample, but I would suggest buying a nice bat that feels good to you. 

Distance to Finish (DTF) is the simplest and most common way to measure distance in sailing. If you take a Great Circle line (the shortest distance on the surface of the Earth) between the boat and the next mark, buoy or finish, that is the DTF. Once round the next mark, the measurement starts again to the following one. It isn't an accurate indicator of who will actually be in the lead, as it doesn't take into account course made good over tides, winds, upwind sailing capability etc., until the boats are close to the mark/buoy/finish line. Because of this, commentators typically provide analysis based on expectations of positions, and this is especially valuable for long distance races such as the Vend√©e Globe. They take into account known weather patterns, sea conditions etc. From the Volvo Ocean Race site (emphasis mine): 

So, as no-one has answered, I thought I'd pop up some of the info I found in my research. It doesn't seem to matter much whether the leader continues or whether you swap leads, however leading for a couple of pitches and then swapping may get your hand in with placing anchors on that climb. Weigh this up against fatigue. The key piece for all multi-pitch climbs is rope handling at each belay point - this is where some additional techniques and practices come into play: From Petzl's guidance:
