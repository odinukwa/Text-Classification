One of the most reproduced images in history, this is The Blue Marble, taken by the Apollo 17 crew on December 7, 1972. Basically the entire Indian Ocean. Mainland Asia in on the horizon at the top, and going around the horizon is Indonesia and Australia just over the horizon, with Antarctica clearly visible on the bottom. If you recreate the view in Google Earth, it's easy to see where everything is. It's also clear there's no place to put an island the size of Tasmania where no one could see it. The only place where it wouldn't be visible in this image is in that large cloud bank southeast of South Africa, but that would have been trivially discovered centuries before this picture was taken. If you know where to look, you can also see the cloud pattern caused by the Kerguelen Islands, which are a lot smaller, isolated, and mapped in 1754. And this is one image. 

Unless the city has trade in some other direction and the meeting between the two nations is just an incidental thing that has nothing to do with the life of the city itself, it won't exist. The road certainly won't exist: if it's used only every 100 years, it will be buried relatively quickly. The main issue you're going to have is the traveling. Someone going 2500 miles on foot is going to take, assuming there's no issues that pop up, maybe 10 miles a day, so 250 days. But it it's a desert and there's no regular traffic, then there's low probability of having sources of resupply along the way (how do they know if an oasis is still there?). That means they need to carry their supplies with them. Assuming they're human, they'll need about two liters of water per day just to survive and stay healthy. So ignoring the extra needed due to walking (which could easily double the amount they need) and the weight of a container, each person will need about half a tonne of water (500 liters) to be carried with them. Then there's the food, their luggage, and what the animals need on top of that. For comparison, the trans-Saharan camel caravans, which would be the closest equivalent, only took 40 days and depended on regularly-maintained wells in order to do it. The Silk Road when it crossed deserts detoured to communities built around water sources and had regular traffic. 

Given the greenery around the castle and that you're in the jungles of Nam (jungle implying a lot of rain, whether seasonal or year-round), the water issue is likely trivially handled by cisterns within the castle itself that collect and store rainwater. Even though slaves hauling water up might be fine on an egotistical sadistic level, it creates a strategic weakness that's exploitable by a besieging force, or someone who just wants to put the screws to you by interfering with the water supply. An average modern household in Canada--which leads the world in domestic water usage (and wastage)--will use 200 liters per person per day, and that's with all the conveniences such as flushing toilets, which are the biggest consumers of water. Get rid of wasteful flushing toilets and other wastes, and 50 liters per person per day seems reasonable for comfort, clean, and health. So let's use that: 50 liters of water per day per person, and that's for all domestic use: drinking, cooking, cleaning, bathing, watering the plants and animals (that aren't feeding on the blood of the enemy, et cetera and so on), and the toilets. For 1500 people, that's 75,000 liters per day, or 75 cubic meters, or (assuming similar year length) 27,375 cubic meters per year. On Earth, rainforests average between 175 and 200 cm of rain per year. If the total catchment area that drains into your cisterns is equivalent to a square 150 meters across (22,500 square meters), that's about 39,000 to 45,000 cubic meters per year, more than enough to handle domestic water needs. For reference, 12 of the cisterns on the north side of Masada hold 40,000 cubic meters between them. In a desert. Surely the Mad Wizard-King of Jagatap can do better in a jungle than King Herod. 

Geology. There would be obvious clues of mining in a few places that could not be caused by natural processes. We are currently mining metal deposits that were formed a very long time ago. For example, the Red Lake gold deposits in Ontario are dated from 2.7 billion years ago. What this means is that there are places where we are mining now which have held valuable commodities for a very long time and which would be a target for mining for any civilization that had preceded us. So what would we find if that had happened? We'd find mineral showings where the richest part of the ore was missing and all that was left was the low-grade material that no one would bother mining. That type of oddity would be accompanied by significant anomalies. Consider an open pit mine and what would happen to it; you'd have that low-grade host rock, but right where you'd expect the high grade material would be, the host rock is missing and you'd find a deposit of sedimentary rock, as if there was a hole where the high-grade material had been removed and that hole had been filled in over time. Mines are not located at random; we know where we should be looking for them, and that's in the same places someone a century ago would be looking for them, someone a millennia ago would be looking for them, and someone millions of years ago would be looking for them. 

It would render a good portion of Europe uninhabitable as it became the center of a spreading rift center causing massive flood basalts erupting up this valley which would then likely cause a global extinction event, so from space there'd be a massive red and black scar ripped across the continent surrounded by a dead or dying world. Also, not much plant or animal life in it, what with the magma ripping through it and all. 

The vast majority of planets aren't inhabitable by humans. Of the few planets potentially inhabitable by humans, some have significant show stoppers (such as plants that use chlorine in their metabolism, resulting in an atmosphere that will kill an unprotected human). Of the few planets potentially inhabitable that can be terraformed in a reasonable amount of time, that still requires a lot of effort and a long time. Unless you're writing an encyclopedia, why would you even bother writing detailed information on so many planets when it's unnecessary? Even in writing set on Earth in the present day, the readers don't get or expect a detailed history and map of Indonesia just because one character happens to come from there. 

It's hard to see why; there's the matter of weight and size and power, which would be a factor for spacecraft or aircraft (since you're keeping it realistic. I'm typing at a desk with two 27" monitors, massing a total of about 7 kilos (not counting the mounting arm): the equivalent screen size in CRTs would be about 63 kilos. The two flatscreen average a total of about 42 watts of power in operation combined; two equivalent CRTs would be 150-200 watts combined. The flatscreens are only a few centimeters deep allowing mounting pretty much anywhere, while the CRTs would need almost a half meter of space behind the screen. And it's easier to make arbitrarily sized displays (as long as you're willing to pay). You want a monitor 3000 pixels wide and 100 pixels high for some stupid reason? Flatscreen tech can do it, a CRT not so easily. There are some applications (such as showing true black) where CRTs might have a slight advantage, but it's not going to be that significant a demand. 

Flak cannon with a timed burst. Shred the internal gas chambers. Note that precision timed airbursts were a solved problem by World War One; shells could be set to detonate in the air above the target, on impact, or after impact, and that was due to timed fusing (proximity fuses only came around in World War Two). Firing at a (slowly) moving target from a (slowly) moving platform is more difficult than ground artillery firing at a fixed position, but again that's a largely solved problem because navies had been working on firing at moving targets from moving guns for a while. The third dimensional aspect (the target could be above or below your own altitude) adds a little more complication, but not much; snipers deal with that issue all the time. All it would require is slightly more math, and once you have the range it wouldn't take many hits to force an airship down. 

So, good luck with that. Note also that this still isn't necessarily going to work. To give an example, even without fossils being available, paleontologists had determined roughly the evolutionary history of the whales, even though the only known fossil cetaceans were already fully aquatic mammals. They were mistaken in what particular group of mammals they'd evolved from, but they had a good idea what the animals had to look like making the transition from land to water. People forget it was only about two decades ago that there was a sudden avalanche of new fossils that confirmed it. Also, while DNA has clarified some things about what groups are more closely related to each other or what descended from what, in most cases it's DNA merely verifying what was already known. Once evolution was proposed as a method of explaining how one type of organism could become another, people immediately made the connection between humans and the apes. That was, in fact, one of the first criticisms people made of evolution because they couldn't accept that humans could possibly be related to apes, and pretty much the reason why some people can't accept it even today. Had the fossil evidence not been found, there still would have been a mountain of accumulating evidence suggesting we'd evolved on Earth and apes were our closest relative, based on analogy to what was being discovered with other species and the way science advanced. 

"Omnilingual", written by H. Beam Piper back in 1954 or so, explains how it can work. There are universals in science and math describing the real world, which two technologically advanced cultures are going to have to share. So, math leads to communication: basic math leads to understanding each others symbols for numbering and mathematical operations, as well as the base system used for counting. Once you have that, you have the capability of translating any number in one language to a number in another. Now, take those numbers. The aliens send you a list that looks like this: 

Conceptually, they'd have no problem grasping the concept. After all, think of religions: "Do this/don't do this and you'll be punished/rewarded" depends on people understanding that doing things will have future consequences for them, which depends on understanding the concept that the future is a "real place" that will be experienced and have people there. If a place is real and has people there, that means, at least in theory, people from there can come here. And time travel isn't a recent concept. Assorted myths have people traveling forward in time, being taken to a place where time runs differently before being returned to the normal world. Traveling backwards is a more recent invention, but then thinking of time as cyclic, as many cultures did, simply means you've traveled long into the future to arrive in the past.
