The book would have to be written in a language that the recipient could understand. Not just the words, but the concepts. It would need a primer, an explanation of the concepts starting with "This is a copper wire, and this is how you connect it to another copper wire." You wouldn't necessarily have to explain how or why it all works (maybe later in the book), just a dumb diagram with plenty of visual instructions. Concepts such as magnetism would have to be worked around for the motor/generator, but that is easy enough. The lightbulb would be more difficult than the motor (electric motor and electric generator are essentially the same thing). I would guess that an alchemist or a priest would be the best person to hand the book to in medieval times in Europe. The alchemist would be used to working with different minerals and metals, and priests were often the most educated. A blacksmith would be able to help. The moslem world was flourishing during those times, and they had a highly advanced grasp of mathematics and science at that time. During the renaissance, your one-stop-shop would have been Leonardo Da Vinci, the original 'renaissance man'. Jack of all trades, and master of them as well. I think that if the book were written the right way, it would be possible for someone in those times to put it all together. If WW2 prisoners of war could build functioning radios out of bits of junk found around the camps, and people 2,000 years ago could make a battery (although the usefulness of the Baghdad battery is disputed), then it would be possible to build some simple electrical devices. As to who would make the best usage for humanity, I couldn't say. After the Roman Empire, Europe was in chaos. Splintered kingdoms who were pretty much all in it for themselves. But I think Leonardo would be your best bet. UPDATE: Thomas Edison's carbon coated bamboo filament lightbulb might work. He already did the hard work inventing it. Not sure how available bamboo was in medieval Europe (assuming you're thinking about Europe). But you could do the research in your current timeline before sending it back to the past. There must be an alternative available to your intended audience. The vacuum inside the bulb could be more or less achieved. A metal box sealed with wax, and emptied of air by a bank of bellows with non return valves. Might be tough to get a complete vacuum, but you'd get a fair way. Maybe oxen turning a geared wheel linked to a cam shaft to keep the bellows going? Have the bulbs and filaments all set up inside the box. Set leather gloves into the side of the box to work on the bulbs inside. Leather would probably leak air into the box, but keep those oxen moving. Promise them a bonus if they make budget. Using the gloves (they'd need to be tight but supple gloves to counter the ballooning that would happen from the negative pressure inside the box, maybe banded with wire), assemble the bulbs. All you'd need to do is attach the glass bulbs onto the bases with the filaments already attached. One problem would be to attach the bulbs and bases together. With the electricity you are already producing, it might be possible to have a soldering iron inside the box. Otherwise some kind of glue, maybe made from boiled sinew, potato starch, whatever. Edison got around 1200 hours of life out of his bamboo filament bulbs. 

Burial Practices The fire people practice funerary cannibalism, and are therefore susceptible to Kuru, a slow disease that is transmitted by consumption of the brain. The Fire nation believes that, just as all fire proceeds from fire, so all life proceeds from life. When somebody dies, their fire goes out, just as an untended flame will wither and die. But, just as two flames brought together will burn as one, so two people, brought together into the same body, will burn together. After a person's flame has gone out, but before the embers have died down, the community gathers to honor them. Each person eats part of the deceased, taking their flame. This way, so long as the community survives, the flames of the ancestors will never go out. The Earth people believe that life proceeds from the ground, and returns to the ground to grow again. This is seen in the daily cycle of eating meals from the ground, followed by defecation into the ground. It is also seen in the cycle of a life, where each child learns first to walk, then to run, but will eventually return to the ground. When an Earth person dies, they are buried, that the strength that they borrowed from the earth may rest, and return to strengthen future generations. 

Another issue would be the Hydrogen Sulphide gas (H2S) that is common around volcanic events. For one thing, H2S is an explosive gas. No lights in the castle after dark. No cooking fires, although you've got plenty of lava to cook your food for you. Another thing is that H2S smells bad. It's often referred to as 'rotten egg gas'. You can start to smell it at less than 1 part per million (ppm). That's only a minor problem though. It is also a toxic gas. The 'Short Term Exposure Limit' for H2S is 15 ppm. The smell would cease to bother you after about 100 ppm, as it basically kills your olfactory nerves, permanently ruining your sense of smell. At about 300 ppm, you are pretty much on your way to death, if not dead already. H2S is heavier than air, so it would settle in the lowest parts of the castle. Dungeons and areas enclosed by the wall, rooms on lower floors etc. Nasty stuff. I don't think I'd want to live in that castle. 

Unlike a person, an AI can be transferred to a new body without issue. An AI can be copied, modified, beamed to another planet, lie dormant on a hard drive for millennia, and so on. In this case, what does it mean for an AI to "die"? The ship that contains the AI may be scuttled, but so long as the AI's data is sent out before the ship is lost, the AI can be started up again on new hardware. Even if the hardware is lost entirely, the AI can be started from a previous backup, which would be equivalent to having a short period of amnesia. So, what forms of death remain, that an AI might suffer for? The only ones remaining are psychological, where the AI realizes that it cannot continue as it is, and turns itself off. Restarting another copy of the AI would just result in the same problem. Even if a trained reverse engineer could remove the psychosis, it may require such fundamental changes that the AI is no longer the same person. Restoring from an old backup might work, but the AI may develop the same psychological problems over time. I propose that a grave of an AI be a copy of it, taken just prior to turning itself off. Visitors can activate the AI, and converse with it for a short amount of time. However, the underlying psychological issues still affect it, and so the AI must be reset to its saved state frequently. These AI are like ghosts: good to talk to, and to get advice from, but not good for long companionship. 

Can't answer for FAA, only the Australian system through CASA. But the US and Australia are both ICAO members, and so pretty similar. Air Law would be a requirement. Not knowing the law will not work as an excuse when the dragon gets Airforce One diverted due to an airspace incursion. Meteorology would only really apply because if the dragon decided to fly into a hurricane, the FAA would be liable to litigation due to not exercising proper duty of care. By making the dragon pass a meteorology exam, they would have satisfied that duty of care, and the rest is up to the dragon. Human Performance and Limitations: What can I say? they'd have to reword that. Aerodynamics: The dragon would probably get away without it, although might need to explain wake turbulence and proper separation behind departing aircraft (if airport takeoffs and landings applied). Aircraft Systems: Probably a medical examination by a designated aviation medical examiner would be good enough. Navigation: A must have. Your dragon needs to know where it is going, especially without using navaids or GPS. Limited to VFR, so must stay under 10,000 feet (I'm assuming that the dragon does not carry supplemental oxygen on board to fly above 10,000 feet. Oxygen + fire breath = bad news). All in all, it's not so much about the dragon's ability to fly, it's more about the dragon's ability to fly in crowded airspace where it could get messy if/when the dragon flew into the path of a 747/C172/F-22/skydiver/sailplane. Ground operation of fire breath: Along the lines of Australian Civil Aviation Orders CAO 20.9 (See part 6). 

I plan on writing the same kind of question / referencing questions related to others elements (Earth, Wind, Fire), so that they would be all linked together for a quick browsing. 

I am roleplaying in a lore where elemental justification is really poor. However, loving a good and strong background, I would like to explain why my character is / would be able to manipulate elements instead of using a gauntlet to do so (his class, by design, uses a gauntlet to simulate elements like fire balls or water drops. The 'how' is not explained. It is just as it is.) Which body / physiologic / evolution could allow a human being to manipulate water ? We are looking here at both scientific (if possible) and/or plausible justifications (= something else that "You can just do it, it is a fantasy magic world"). Here are the perks, considering the result we are trying to achieve: 

Because you yourself are part of the simulation. In order to maximize happiness, it must simulate the result of each possible output that it can produce. One of those possible outputs is the command to destroy the machine, which must be tested within a simulated world. Within that simulated world, there is a simulated person, reading the results of the simulated machine, which outputs "destroy the machine". This simulated person is you. After many years, once the machine deems your universe not worse continuing, then it will end abruptly. Try not to worry about it. 

Perhaps the villagers are intentionally excluded, in order to see what technology they will invent. If the higher beings give tech to the villagers, then the villagers will progress along the same path as the higher beings did. On the other hand, by letting them struggle on their own, it may result in different discoveries than had happened in the higher beings' development. This is not without historical precedent. China produced far better pottery/porcelain than Europe, and therefore had no need to develop better glass. Europe relied on glass instead, and so there was a supply of people who knew how to work glass. This meant that refractive lenses could be developed, and microscopes/telescopes could be invented. 

Of course, all those weapons must be carefully assembled, fortified when it comes to linking. Even if not for fighting, it would be bad for your king if a fang decided to fall as nothing happened. A blacksmith might assemble everything together, because here we suppose we know someone who- oh, wait, this is off-topic. Your weapons are strong, and ready, my King. 

I am really open-minded and would be glad to discuss / answer any additional info you need to let water flow through the answers. Let the water splash ! 

Some ideas that come in my mind at the moment: The Ivory Knight Kill a shark and an elephant. Take the ivory from the elephant, carve it as a weapon (some 1-handed sword) and sword, and inlay the teeth as the blade. Take a classic handle with leather, add some peacock feathers to the guard to make it look both pretty and deadly. This way, you have a light sword who look deadly. Think about a dealdier, bigger, prettier version of this badass over here. The Ivory Berserker The same idea as above, but take more ivory to make a two-handed sword. Now we're talking. The Sea King Take a swordfish. His nose is a deadly monster about penetration. Kill two or three of them, make them into either a trident, a single spear, a sword or either of them. Reinforced its raw design with feathers and jewelry. You have there some pretty weapons from the sea. The Magic Wielder Take a simple, long staff. Take an intimidating dead animal, like a dead goat or something similar (ofter a goat or a ram). Put it at the end of your staff. Keep the skin to decorate the top of your staff, between the handle and the actual head. Get some precious stones (ruby, for fire and fury e.g) and put them inside the eyes. As always, beautiful feathers and some pieces of clothing may make everyone believe you mastered magic. The Bulky King Tahe the skin of an armadillo. Take a staff, which you will carve as a weapon, either one or two-handed. If two-handed, plan some more armadillo's skin. You're making a ball from the skin(s), and carve interesting parts of animals onto it. For example, eagle fangs, lion claws, tiger teeth. If it is a two-handed, vary between them in order to make it look even deadlier, between penetration and actual cutting through. Decoration, feather, clothing, and there you are: no one will ever want to take a hit on this weapon. 

Perhaps the engines and the guns are a single device. Both are designed to propel a small amount of material away from the ship as fast as possible. The only difference is that in one case you point it at the enemy, and in the other, you point it behind you. This would have an interesting effect on tactics and formations. You would need to plan your approach route such that no other ships pass through your exhaust. A ship can easily retreat while firing, and has difficulty advancing while firing. In order to do so, ships could build up momentum, whip around, then fire at opponents while coasting forward.
