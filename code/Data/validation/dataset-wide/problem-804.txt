For the purposes of this simple exercise, what would be an analytical expression that roughly matches the Milky Way's radial density profile, projected on to its equatorial plane? For spherically symmetric distributions, Newton's Shell theorem allows one to treat all mass inside a sphere defined by an orbit's radius as if it were at the center, and to ignore all mass in the shell outside of that radius. Is there anything like an analog to this for a radial distribution within a plane? 

I generally agree with the answer above, but have a couple more insights which might help you if you decide to proceed with trying to make your own scope... The lens pairs that James mentioned (crown and flint) are known as a doublet. Glass has two key properties in play here - its index of refraction (how much it bends light) and its dispersion (how much that bending changes over color). The lens pair balances a strongly convex crown (low index and low dispersion) with a weakly concave flint (high index and high dispersion). The dispersions are designed to cancel out, while you want the curvature of the convex crown to overpower the concave flint in terms of index, so it still has some ability to focus. The design also inherently lends itself toward long focal lengths which are desirable in telescope objectives. Eyepieces, due to their short-desirable focal lengths necessitate more lenses which allow you to balance the chromatic aberration, and also address other optical aberrations which come into play with such a short focal length (distortion, astigmatism, coma, and spherical aberration being the main concerns). There are well-established design forms which are often used for making well-corrected eyepieces, some of which can be found right on wikipedia: $URL$ One thing to consider, which I don't think has been mentioned is selection of focal lengths and apertures. A 5cm aperture is plenty sufficient to view the Galilean moons, and probably some bright DSOs if you're well-corrected, and if your focal lengths are well-chosen. The system magnification is the ratio of focal lengths between the objective lens and eyelens/eyepiece. (200cm/2.2cm = 90.9x). This means that something like the Galilean moons, which have a max extent of about 1/8 degree, would be magnified to have an apparent extent of 11 degrees (much easier to resolve). Your aperture selection (particularly of your objective) will determine the light-gathering ability. But the magnification applies here too, so if you have a 5cm objective at 91x, your "exit pupil" will only be 0.55mm diameter, which is tiny compared to your eye's aperture. You'd still be able to see the object, but your eyes will easily accommodate up to a 30cm objective aperture (3mm exit pupil). Keep in mind, there is a tradeoff between aperture and aberrations, so unless you're designing a very well-aligned 2- or 3-element objective, you may want to stick with a max objective aperture of 50-75mm. In terms of alignment, don't just set the lenses a certain distance apart and expect to see an image. You will need to allow for some adjustment, which is probably easier looking at a distant object during the day. After you form an image, you may need to adjust the centration and tilt of the eyelens to form the sharpest image to optimize your alignment. All that said, a small aperture, high-end refractive (glass) telescope can perform better than a reflective telescope of the same aperture. But as aperture increases, the cost of the materials and impact of aberrations makes refractive telescopes vastly inferior to reflective (mirror) telescopes. Since the design for these only necessitates 1 powered mirror and an off-the-shelf eyepiece for $50 or less, the best bang for your buck will definitely be a reflective telescope. Sorry if that's not what you're hoping to hear, but it's why most telescopes on the market today are reflective. 

Similarly, many of the photons arriving from Proxima may be many tens of thousands of years old. Their travel time from Proxima's photosphere is only a small part of their journey to Earth. 

I think the question is referring to situating a very large mirror in space facing earth. If we were to put it several light minutes away, then events occurring opposite the mirror could be reviewed de novo with more preparation upon the warning we received upon the first light of the event arriving at earth. For example, a supernova going off in M31 might not be under observation at the moment its light first arrives, and so the initial observations might be lost. However, with a mirror facing M31, we would be able to observe that mirror as the event unfolded, having been warned that there was something worth watching, in advance. Nice idea! But it would likely be much less expensive to simply have multiple telescopes always watching "prime" starscape for unexpected events. 

It depends on the telescope. If the telescope is fully reflective (no transparent glass elements), it should be able to operate well-beyond visual wavelengths, with its transmission limited primarily on your mirror costing material. $URL$ Any telescope with refractive (transparent glass) elements however, will quickly lose performance outside of the visual range due to transmission, but also from how the glass index changes with wavelength, which causes non-visual light to be defocused (an effect which increases the further you get from visual wavelengths). Generally speaking, the defocused issue of refractive telescopes can be compensated if you have enough focus travel. You will see "chromatic aberration" becoming much more significant very quickly, as telescopes are only designed to correct this over visual wavelengths. Ultimately, the limiting factor of refractive telescopes is the transmission of the glass in the lenses. Many glasses will transmit reasonably well from 400-2000nm, though some have worse performance and some have better. 

What you are looking for is the navigation method used by ships and aircraft before the advent of GPS. It requires not only an instrument for measuring the angle between the sun or a star (such as Polaris) and the horizon, but also an accurate time measurement, and charts that can be used to interpret the numbers. And of course an accurate chronometer -- you'll need to know the time at Greenwich Obervatory, in London. The traditional instrument used for determining this angle is the sextant. Here is an article describing the use of a sextant for deterining one's position: $URL$ I suppose that an algorithm for doing what you are asking is available where good sextants are sold - as to the charts, well, perhaps there are downloadable charts somewhere. Also, here is a good article on determining latitude and longitude by the stars. Latitude is what a sextant will tell you, longitude is determined differently. For that you need two clocks: one set to GMT; one set to your local UTC time (NOT your timezone time). The method is described here: How to Calculate Longitude. Which brings us to the question of how to calculate your local solar time, which is described in this article How to Calculate Solar Time. Clearly you can't use this for navigation - it's convenient for human economics, but not finding your location. Just to make it clear why you can't use local civil time for determining longitude is that the solar time is nearly the same on both Hawaii and Kodiak islands, but Hawaii's civil time is one hour after Kodiak's. And China stretches some 5,026 kilometers across the East Asian landmass, which is about 4 hours of solar time, but it all has the same civil time. This question might better be asked in the Sailing SE. Oh, wait, there isn't one, yet. 

You're close! What you built is a back-to-back set of Galilean telescopes (with an overall magnification of 1:1). The reason you're getting a smaller circle, but with a life-size image, is that the light bundles in the middle are diverging faster, and so you lose the edges if the Galilean assemblies are too far apart. Military perisopes use optical relays to get the image down the tube without blocking out any of the view. In simple terms, they have one relatively short-focusing group of achromatic/apochromatic lenses (called an Objective) to focus the light to a crosshair, like in a rifle scope. From there, the image is picked up by another long-focusing lens group called a relay. The relay re-collimates the light (but at low angles). The light is focused and collimated several times through the tube, until it reaches a final image plane, which is then looked at with an eyepiece (like you might have in a telescope). Overall, you can think of a periscope as a telescope/monocular/riflescope with relatively low magnification with several pairs of relays in between. A point of note, you need an even number of image planes (0, 2, etc) to avoid having an upside-down image. I can go into a lot more detail or provide some resources, but I think this most directly answers your question. Please let me know if there's any other questions on this. Source: I design optics for periscopes for naval applications. Edit for additional questions: First, the most comprehensive resource I found in my lazy search is this page: $URL$ which is actually written by a previous engineer at my company. There's a ton of information there, mostly intended for people who already know about optical design, but there's probably a good amount you can get from it as well. To the question in your comment: in your preliminary design, the positive and negative lenses are taking collimated light input, and outputting collimated light. However, since they are acting as a telescope with magnification power, the angle of the rays coming out is wider than the angle going in (by a factor equal to your magnification). The trick to a relay lens design (used in periscopes and some kinds of endoscopes, as well as other applications) is to get the collimated spaces short enough that you don't lose that light before it spreads out. Or more accurately, that you get the angles of the collimated light to be small enough that you can spread out your lenses quite a bit while still maintaining this condition. Regarding field of view: you're absolutely not stuck with a small FOV. That depends entirely on the focal length of your objective. A short focal length lens as your objective will give you a wider field of view (so long as your light isn't clipped by your top mirror). You could also have an objective that changes focal length (a zoom lens) to change your field of view as desired. For your application, an SLR camera lens could work quite well for this. Regarding tube length: You could vary the spacing in the sections where the light is collimated. This will impact how much light is being lost from it spreading out too much (typically limited by whichever section is longest). The result will be a dropoff in the relative illumination (how bright the edge of the FOV is compared to the center). This is an effect known as vignetting, and can be mitigated, but not without tradeoffs.
