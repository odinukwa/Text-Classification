A little of both. You can go to your local gym or outside on routes that you feel comfortable climbing and once you get a few feet above a solid bolt or bomber piece of gear, let go. Read this article on practicing falling, and this one. Since you know you're going to fall, the fall won't feel the same as a surprise lead fall, but you can learn how to relax and react. You can continue doing this on various types of climbs (slab, crack, overhang, etc.) to get the hang of falling. After some practice, try pushing your limits (safely) on a project to get over the psychological aspect of falling. If falling is all you are thinking about when you're climbing, you won't enjoy the climb and you are much more likely to actually take a fall. 

Regardless of the type of slab, avoid any prolonged contact with the rock, try to avoid getting caught on anything, and if you ever get flipped as you're falling, tuck and roll. Crack Avoid any jams that might not come out if you fall so you don't break something or get flipped. If it's a wide crack (off-width), you may need to apply the same types of techniques for falling as you would climbing slab. Overhang Avoid any jams or positions that will keep you from taking a clean fall. Watch your footwork and hands so you don't get in a position that will cause you to flip or get caught in the rope. If you're falling into a wall, relax the knees and elbows to soften the impact. 

For camping, I would recommend a disposable, stored in some sort of secure container that will protect it from random stuff pushing on the gas lever. I typically have a second one in a waterproof container, similarly protected from random stuff from letting all the gas leak out. 

If you put down a ground tarp that is significantly larger than the tent (and by significant I mean more than an inch or so), tuck any extra under the tent, otherwise rain will hit the tarp and then go straight to the tent-floor, opening the door for tent-floods. I have never put a tarp inside a tent, but I have also never had an issue with tent-flooding once I learned to tarp outside and tuck under. 

Take a regular rectangular tarp, lay it out such that it is as close to the tent's size as possible. Then take any amount of extra that is on the UPHILL SIDE, and fold UNDER THE TARP any excess. Any water that comes downhill is then channeled underneath the groundcloth. 

If you want an exact answer, there is not and will not be one until about 15 seconds after you finish walking the walk. For a decent ballpark, I was taught in scouts: day hiking: 3 miles per hour, + 1 hour for every 1000 feet of elevation climb. backpacking: 2 miles per hour, +1 hour for every 1000 feet of elevation climb. Use the formula, and then take a few walks. You should get a rough idea how your pace measures up to the formula and be able to adjust the formula accordingly. 

To expand on an earlier answer, and what the OP himself mentions, I will add a few more elements. First, the count of persons on the trip. The rescuers need to know when they are done. If they've found four people and five went on the trip, for example, that means they keep searching. Add notes of any relevant medical information about each person, such as diabetic, heart condition, mobility issues, and so on. Next, a broad inventory of what equipment you have, to give some indication of how well prepared you are to aid your own survival and rescue. If you went out for what should have been a day hike without a tent and only a small lunch, for example, it might indicate a greater sense of urgency then if you went out for a week long trip with full kit. Finally, it may be useful to provide a description of your vehicle(s), to include license plate numbers, and at what trail head you will be parked. As a former member of the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary, we would request this information when receiving a report of an overdue vessel, especially if the boat was launched from a trailer at a ramp. We would send someone by car to that ramp to look for the tow vehicle and trailer, to verify the boat had not been recovered at the ramp. Even for a boat at a marina, we might call that marina and ask if the owner's car was still in the parking lot. The same concept applies to an excursion in the woods instead of the waters. The rescuers will send someone to the trail head parking area to verify you have not returned to your vehicle. For further guidance, here is a sample float plan from the USCGAux, and here is a similar form for hikers from Los Angeles County Sheriff Department. 

All of your situations look like emergencies, especially if you are alone. I read an article where the National Park Service was angry at use of PLBs because someone climbed a mountain and did not want to down-climb, or they were "tired" but seemed to not have nay other condition that would negatively affect their ability to walk out of the wilderness, or they had a single 1-liter canteen and ran out of water in the desert. I believe misuse of the PLB is when you didn't do your due diligence or continue trying to solve the problem until you were out of options. I think as long as you are able to walk/self rescue, then do so. You may be asked to foot the bill for any sort of rescue, and that will likely be several thousand dollars. If it's worth 5000 bucks to get help, then you are likely ready to flip the switch. 

Like others have said, the best training to hike is hiking. If you are concerned about being able to climb large vertical distances (mountains?), try climbing stairs. I don't mean the stair-climber at the gym (although it does help), but put on a pack with weight and find a tall building. Clear this with any security the building may have (or management/owner), and climb the fire stairs for a half hour. Once your body starts to acclimate to the challenge, increase the time that you climb the stairs. 

(This discussion ignores things like external keels and tracking channels.) As a paddler, you will need to learn how your craft handles, and will observe these characteristics: 

First, a note on terminology. There are several groups of knots that have a certain what I call topology. When that topology in the rope is tied around a fixed object, the resulting knot has one name, but when turned around that object then tied around the standing end of the rope, it has a different name. Further, some knots can also be used to join ends of two ropes, and then it will have yet a different name. Examples include the pairs you listed: 

The OP provides an nicely detailed self answer, but I would like to add that when such areas exist, they are of particular concern to mariners1, and are therefore well-documented for nautical navigation purposes. I will use as my example an area at the north-eastern end of Lake Ontario, as it begins to meet the St. Lawrence River. The anomaly lies in the channel between the city of Kingston, ON on the mainland and Wolfe Island, in Canadian waters2. NOAA chart 14802 covers this area. If you follow this link and zoom in, you will read this annotation on the chart: 

Afterthought: You are far from the first to wonder, and it was such a big deal a few hundred years ago to find a way to measure longitude while at sea, that major prizes were offered to anyone who could do it. The competition was so fierce, that eventually a movie was made about it. The creatively title Longitude may be of interest to you. 

After a long day on the trail, I'll take my grooming bucket (reused plastic margarine or sherbet container with lid), and go down to the water hole. Collect some water and rinse out the bandana. Start at the head and work my way down/in. I'll pull off my shirt and then wash my torso. Pull off my socks and wash my legs. I then wash my groin area, and immediately change into my "camp" clothes. I tend to not use soap, and whenever the water in my bucket gets "icky", I'll toss onto the grassy area near where I'm washing, and refill with river water. Once I'm washed and wearing my camp clothes, then I'll fill my container and wash my clothes, and hang them up once I'm back in camp. If the wash water was suspect, I'll frequently then take purified water and give myself a bandana-bath and dispose of that used water far from the watersource. I tend to not use soap if at all possible, because I found that it does not always rinse cleanly, and that residue is a little annoying in the city, it's a horrible rash if it's in sensitive and high-friction areas. 

Tent: A 2 person tent divides up really well between Tent/rainfly, and poles/groundcloth, a 4 person tent breaks down each component even more. Share with a bigger tent and you should be good to go Sleeping Bag: Go in the summer months, when the temperature will be warm. I live in the Mid-Atlantic, and typically take an Army Surplus Poncho liner as my sleeping bag on trips in the late spring-early fall. In the height of summer, I bring a cotton sheet (I know, cotton is bad, but it's all I got). Sleeping Pad: If you are careful about your sleeping spot you don't need one of these. However, it's always the first "luxury" item that I pack. I won't camp without my mattress. If you can, however, I'd loan mine to the newbie friend, or use a spare/borrow one from a friend. Stove: Most backpacking food reads like: Boil X volume water. Add powder. Stir. Let sit Y minutes. Plan to share food/utensils, and you should be good to go. Food: Again, double up and plan to cook/eat 2 person meals instead of 2-1 person meals. Eating Utensils: All the friend would need is the bowl and spoon. Bowls can be repurposed from frozen dessert topping containers, large butter/margarine tubs, etc. Sure, it will fall apart after a few uses, but you can't beat the price Water Bottles: If you know anyone who beverages out of plastic bottles, collect and reuse them. Wash them out and use as water bottles. I've personally used 1 liter soda bottles for months before they wear out. Best part, it's free (assuming you'd drink the soda/water/juice to begin with). Backpack: Either borrow a full pack from a friend, or pack as much as you can in your pack and have him bring along the biggest backpack (daypack) he has. Alternate days. One final note: You can rent almost all the gear needed from a local REI. I'm not sure if you need to be a member (recommended if you will be buying a lot of gear), or if they will rent to Joe Public, but worth looking into.
