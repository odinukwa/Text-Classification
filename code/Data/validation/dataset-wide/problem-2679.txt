It would be quite bad for Churchland's argument if – ironically – the power of this cunning Cartesian paradigm is inextricably linked to the success of reductionist science and therefore the motivation for physicalism. One also has to notice the fact that we tend to cling to paradigms familiar to us. Classical physics is (aside from a few cracks) completely deterministic and even someone as intelligent as Einstein had difficulties to let go of that. Is there a way to strengthen Churchland's argument so such rejoinders and skepticism get defused? Did anybody sympathetic to Churchland's argument go into a little more detail? 

I don't know much about Nietzsche. I can only tell you that in German the abbreviation GA usually stands for “Gesamtausgabe” (= collected works). According to this list here there's no single work by Nietzsche which is abbreviated by “GA”. It would also be weird to do that, because of the confusion for German speakers: GA = “Gesamtausgabe” is a pretty standard abbreviation. 

First, you overestimate the agreement that incest is morally wrong. Yes, I would find it viscerally disgusting to “mate” with my sister, but many philosophers wouldn't accept this subjective feeling as an argument for the claim that incest between adult siblings is morally wrong (if it is consensual and no children are conceived). Now to the main point: There are people who argue that because homosexuality is not found in nature (which is incorrect), it must be immoral. In this case the argument that it is found in nature shows a fatal flaw in the premise of this reasoning. Of course, this alone does not mean that homosexuality (or more precisely, a homosexual act) is moral, it just refutes the argument before it even starts. You would need to supply another argument to justify your claim that homosexuality is immoral. Because in general, the person making the claim has the burden of proof. In reality, something else is behind the meaning of “natural”, which is not found in the clumsy and wrong argument that homosexuality is not found in nature. It means that by looking at the genitals we can guess what their purpose must be – presumably heterosexual intercourse. So the argument would be: Since a homosexual act frustrates the purpose of the genitals, it is immoral. But this line of reasoning assumes a lot. Arguing on the basis of purposes (teleology) is not fashionable anymore. That's something from the Scholastics in the middle ages. It would be rejected by most philosophers today. And even if we agree (contra Darwin) that there are purposes in nature and in ourselves, can we really be so sure that we can correctly detect those? And even if we accept that homosexuality frustrates the purpose of the genitals, it still doesn't follow that homosexuality is immoral. Because why should the frustration of the purpose of something be morally wrong? 

It obviously seems 2. and 3. are not real for Sartre. But does he justify the connection of 2. and 3. anywhere? 

we get only losses. Never two heads in a row. In a realistic example, we can intuit that it would work. A “truly” random sequence would more start like this: 

I've read restatements of Epicurus' famous argument which attempt to prove that the fear of death is irrational (I don't know if Epicurus himself ever used a word like this. From what I've read, he only hints at it). To me, it's absurd on the face of it to call an emotion like fear itself irrational (or rational). So what theory of emotions do we need to accept, that this move is even possible to us? Let's assume the usual definition of rationality (epistemic + instrumental). We could argue, of course, that speaking of irrational emotions (something we commonly do) is just a manner of speech. What we really mean by it, is, that irrational beliefs about reality led to such an emotion or irrational decisions are caused by this emotion. In this case, we can call the fear of flying irrational: it often results from irrational beliefs about the dangers of flying and often causes irrational decisions (if we assume desires/goals typical for a human being). But in the case of the fear of death, this does not help. If Epicurus thought that irrational beliefs about reality are involved in the case of death, he certainly would see them in people who believe in an afterlife (and then the argument does not work anyway). Also, aside from special cases, decisions don't seem to be possible in the context of death. And what desires/goals on which basis we could judge the rationality of such decisions would we be talking about about anyway? If I'm correct, it seems we have to adopt a quite idiosyncratic theory about rationality and emotions, so that Epicurus' argument can at least proceed. What could that be? And are such theories commonly held among contemporary philosophers? One would assume they are, since Epicurus' argument is still held in high regard. 

In the discussion about free will, moral realism and libertarianism go hand in hand. It seems that libertarian free will is assumed to be what we need to “attach” moral responsibility to certain actions. And this is also one of the major critiques of compatibilism, that it just doesn't seem to allow for moral responsibility. As Nietzsche puts it succinctly: 

It is easier if we just look at a less ambitious subset of absolute freedom of speech: absolute freedom to publicly defend a certain thesis. Because this would exclude a lot of obnoxious stuff which is prohibited everywhere, including countries arguably maintaining a high respect for free speech, e.g. the US (contrary to Europe). Still, even this subset is problematic, because of libel laws. And libel laws are something dictators always abuse first, for example Hitler endlessly sued newspapers for libel before he was in power. But formally we can differentiate the US from a dictatorship, because at least any opinion, which is not about single individuals, can legally be publicly defended. You can, for example, legally deny the holocaust. For European democracies this is much more difficult, probably impossible. For example, what is the difference between criminalizing Armenian genocide denial (France) or criminalizing the claim that the Armenian genocide happened (which counts as the crime of “insulting Turkishness”, article 301 of the Turkish penal code)? Formally there is no difference. Of course, I believe that the Armenian genocide happened and so that Turkey's law is horrible, while I am relaxed about France's law. But if I argue that way, I leave the meta-level which tries to be neutral of the validity and worth of an opinion. 

can be expanded to a sensible argument, even the corrected version of Dawkins' fairy-analogy completely misses the mark and is not illuminating. To make a good analogy, we first would have to carefully stipulate what we mean by evidence, since it cannot be scientific evidence. How much sense does it make to speak of “evidence” outside of science and the usual applications for which the term is robustly defined (like law)? Is there “philosophical evidence”? For example, we regard it as highly irrational to doubt that other people have consciousness / subjective experience (= “other minds”). But how could we define “evidence” so that we really have evidence for “other minds”? There is no contradiction in conceiving a being who behaves like a normal human but lacks subjective experience, after all. In the end, depending on the definition, it might turn out that there actually is evidence against fairies and no evidence against God, so the analogy would break down. But we never get that far. 

So it seems clear to me, that materialism because of its nihilistic implications is incompatible with anything that can justifiably be called spirituality. 

Also, in most cases, sex work is not a work you can do till retirement, rather opportunities get meager well before reaching middle age. While an ex-prostitute will have an embarrassing-to-explain gap in her “normal” working history, on top of that a former pornographic actress will also be recognizable as such by colleagues and customers. This will far more seriously limit post-sex-work employment opportunities. Your past life as a pornographic actress will always haunt you. jobermark's idea that the presence of the camera documents abuse, has some plausibility to it, but completely lacks empirical evidence. For example, why do we not know if the allegations against James Deen are true? Why didn't the camera help to either corroborate the accusations against him (or to exonerate him)? Can jobermark show that the porn set is really such a controlled environment? Also, to make his argument cogent, he should have presented some evidence that criminalization of prostitution really reduces, in total, abuse (this is questionable – including for the “Nordic Model”). To sum it up, there may be many internally consistent ways to legislate pornography production and prostitution (it becomes a question of your values at some point, of course). But regardless what your position on sex work is in general, one thing is beyond reasonable doubt: the current US legislation is grotesque by all measures. But now to your second question: 

is wrong. As long as he ignores this serious, pressing problem, we have all the right to regard the existence of God as a philosophical question, not a scientific question. While it is highly questionable that the following 

Many old definitions of material and immaterial leave something to be desired. For example, how does a (supposedly) sizeless electron fit into Descartes' world of res extensae and res cogitantes? A more modern approach is to use the term physical. A photon is sizeless and even massless (no rest mass), but it is physical, because it can be observed. The debate in modern philosophy is then if "stuff" like qualia may be non-physical. Now, from my understanding of Aristotle, he didn't have a concept of qualia and regarded the whole "sensing something" as a completely material process. Yet he argued that the intellect is immaterial... So, what is it that makes matter matter for Aristotle? What is his definition of material and immaterial? It seems that matter for Aristotle encompasses everything physical (in the modern understanding) and even more. 

would be true. The question is of course, if we should interpret “if … then” in this way and not, as it is common, assume some stronger sort of dependence. But what could this dependence which goes beyond the purely logical look like in this case? So from a common-sense standpoint your sentence would simply be nonsensical, but still not a contradiction. 

The sea battle argument is based on the theorem (P ∨ ¬P) in propositional logic. In itself this theorem doesn't seem to give us anything absurd under the interpretation that P could stand for “there will be a sea battle tomorrow” – exactly for the reasons described above. But the soundness criterion for propositional logic is about truth assignments: any truth assignment to propositional variables in a theorem will reduce to “true”. But doesn't this at least hint at the assumption that any propositional variable has either truth value “true” or “false” – which again gives rise to the sea battle paradox? 

If your atheist vegan drives in the summer, insects (which probably are not “robots”) will find their deaths in her car's grill. And this is not an unforeseeable accident, it is guaranteed to happen. So she “should” (the vague word used in moral realist discourse) not drive. But as J. L. Mackie noticed amusedly, “anyone who really means business uses ‘must’ [instead of should]”. Do you think she must not drive with her car in the summer? I doubt it. So, there is no good way to judge partial compliance. You could also claim that everyone who does not live like a Jain nun or monk (sans celibacy) is not a moral person, but this would border on the absurd. 

On the other hand, modern philosophers (and scientists) abundantly use Aristotle's theories as examples of archaic and discredited ideas. Teleology, Aristotelian physics (e.g. the impossibility of the vacuum), Aristotelian cosmology (the concept of the "sublunary sphere"), essentialism, his political views (slavery as natural, women = "deformed males"), the concept of eudaimonia etc. are all viewed with various grades of contempt. How can one explain this apparent paradox? I wouldn't be surprised if modern philosophers see Aristotle as influential yet for the negative - but he is seen as a great philosopher. 

you'd have a Mount Everest to climb to get to a convincing-sounding justification. Now to the most obvious concocted pseudo-justification, from an answer a Quora poster gave, to which user Pacerier linked here in a comment: 

There are a few philosophers who still push the “perverted faculty argument” to prove that contraception, homosexual acts and masturbation are immoral. This argument is based on classic natural law, which is itself based on a metaphysics that assumes essentialism and teleology (broadly Aristotelian). Because of that, it's usually not taken seriously anymore. It would still be interesting to find out if such arguments even fail at a late stage, when a lot of heavy lifting has already been done (that is, the opponent has granted all the relevant metaphysical foundations). One version is the 40-page article by Edward Feser: In Defense of the Perverted Faculty Argument (please read at least the twelve pages of part IV. before answering, thank you). He states his key premise (full argument on page 403f) as: 

Of course, using this definition, strong emergence would obviously exist. But in my view this definition of strong emergence makes not much sense philosophically. We introduced a technical term and now apply this term to certain properties of systems, but in reality we are just referring to our epistemological state (i.e. what we can know with the current science and computational methods). With such a definition there would not be a “discrete” difference between weak and strong emergence. It would be much more interesting and useful to insert the words “in principle” into the definition: 

But now, if the rules were different and we would only win if we get heads twice in a row, we should assume a ratio approaching 0.25. But a regrouping of the sequence above would not work. With H = heads (formerly W), T = tails (formerly L) written grouped:
