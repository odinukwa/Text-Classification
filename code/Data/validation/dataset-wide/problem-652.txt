Definitely carry a tube or 2. Flats seem to happen in the rain which makes patching harder. The roadside puncture kit should have a sealed tube of glue as it goes off once opened (unless you get on with glueless patches). Once I've opened a tube I patch any punctured tubes, which become my spares. With old-fashioned patches this works. Then your only consumable is patching supplies (and the rare blowout; I've had one in 25000 miles - overinflation). I can vouch for marathon plus too, but I'm currently riding marathon supreme which should be a bit faster while still having a decent level of protection. I run liners on another bike and they've caused one puncture but saved a few. On that bike it's broken glass I'm most worried about. I only use them on that bike because I was too cheap to do it properly. With good anti-puncture tyres, liners would probably do more harm than good. Slime works well but can be a bit of a pain if you have to let the tube down (e.g. replacing a tyre, rim or spoke). Suggestion: go for gatorskins or marathon plus/sumpreme. Add slime only if that's not enough. Keep the pressure up. 

Like you I run one bike for a range of things - commuting, touring, audax and the occasional faster ride. It's a tourer. When I want to spend the money I'll get a second wheel set: narrower (and narrower tyres), fewer spokes, lighter, deeper. Then I'll have one wheelset for fast, another for tough. Swapping wheels is quick enough to be not worth worrying about especially as I could commute on either set. 

Any protection must be applied to the bike, as dirt between the lock and bike will abrade both, but the bike is more fragile and valuable. The only way to avoid dirt is to not use the bike. Stickers are good but have to be replaced fairly often. Cable ties and clear repair tape are also useful. I've used reflective tape on the seat stay of one bike where the D lock abrades the paint. An old fashioned solution that works very well is to use an old inner tube on the bike, strapped or knotted in place 

You could also try 2 D-locks, 1 round the hard point, 1 round the frame or back wheel, and interlinked to form a chain. I suggest long thin ones, of 2 different brands so the keys are dissimilar and you don't get confused. It doesn't look easy to pick up (though easier than a bakfiets which was what I imagined when I saw the title), so making it non-ridable is also helpful - take the saddle indoors perhaps. The old technique of taking off the front wheel and locking it to the back wheel also slows down a ride-off thief, as does any form of lock fixing the front wheel to the frame (yes, ideally to a hardpoint as well) With respect to the patio, could you fit a ground anchor into a heavy concrete parasol base and lock to that? You will probably end up with 2 locking setups - keep the heaviest stuff at home, but have some means of locking it up while out as well. 

A note for the pedantic: Yes, graphite powder is better for locks in the general case. But it doesn't keep moisture out, which is why many bike lock manufacturers recommend oil. 

A couple of time recently I've seen a bike being ridden near work with drop bars, but upside down and with the brake levers facing towards the rider. By upside down, I mean as if the stem bolts were loosened and the bars rotated 180Â°, not set up like bullhorns. I'm inclined to assume that this is a misguided attempt to make the bike more comfortable, but it looked the right size for the rider, who was riding on the bar tops when I saw him this morning. It would seem like the brakes are almost impossible to reach quickly or to cover. What benefit could this have for the rider? 

On some pedal designs such as these, you may be able to get a screwdriver or similar improvised pry bar under the moving part of the clip. This should free it up, but you might need to twist the shoe, pull the toe up at the same time. 

The limit isn't so much survivability as handling and comfort. If you're looking to ride on gravel roads as well as tarmac, but not MTB singletrack, two main options are tourers and cyclocross bikes. The latter will probably be faster and more manoeuvrable but the former can carry more (especially if you have big feet and don't want to kick your panniers). They can take similar sized tyres, at least if you have disc brakes (e.g. my tourer came with 35mm tyres with a bit of tread and could go to at least 40mm without the mudguards). Neither will be quite as fast or as light as a road bike built for racing, but will be more comfortable if you plan to ride all day. This assumes you want drop bars. Very similar features are available with flat bars as well. 

I can fit a full gym kit (excluding shoes, which I'd ride in, and water, which is in a bottle cage) in my handlebar bag. That may provide another option that's cheap than a rack+panniers. Otherwise backpack panniers start from quite cheap (OK, but not hard wearing) and go up to very expensive. 

One of my bikes has no indicators and I'm less familiar with it than my other bike which has indicators and more years especially at the top. But I don't find it to be a problem. You don't need to know exactly which gear you're in, just enough to know (e.g) that if you want to drop a gear you need to drop a chainring. A combination of feel and a vague recollection of what I've done is normally enough for that. 

I'd run it under a cold shower if the lint roller suggested in the comments (or not too sticky tape) didn't work. A helmet that can't take a cold shower can't take rain and is therefore useless unless you live in a desert (which Sweden, where it apparently comes from, isn't renowned for). One further thing to try is a vacuum cleaner with a soft brush attachment. Ideally you'd use reduced power or open a vent hole so you don't suck too hard. 

That's a pinhead security fastener. You should have got a key to match with the bike. Without the matching key number you can't get a replacement key either. Here's a picture of a pinhead key fom about 2010. Yours will look at bit different. The key number is under the red blob, and the pins to mate with the nut are in the silver bit on the right. As you can see, mine is old and battered, so the original keyring attachment failed and I drilled a hole in it. There's another format that looks like a hex nut on one end as well. 

Many of the major brands offer equivalents. This is something where sticking to the big brands probably makes sense, as there's plenty of junk out there too. These tend to be entry-to-midrange bikes (though there are exceptions) but unless the park is up a mountain or 10s of km away hey'd be more than adequate. Compared to the full-size equivalents you probably get slightly lower-spec gearing, but that can usually be upgraded quite easily/cheaply especially if done when the bike is being serviced anyway. They're often in stock in big bike shops so test rides should be easy to arrange. Compared to squeezing onto a slightly too-large bike (at a similar price point) you should get a lighter frame, and if you go for suspension it should be capable of being set up for someone of that weight. A test ride is essential whether you go down this route or try for the smallest bike marketed for adults. And a tip: getting moving with a trailer is harder than without; jumping up onto the saddle every start isn't going to make it easy. 

According to the manufacturer tapping the end nearest the faulty bolt should free it up. Actually it's not enough just to tap the end (I used a large adjustable spanner), you have to jiggle the key (in and out of the unlocked position) while tapping away at it. That was less tricky on the bike than testing for this post (but scuffing the paintwork isn't a worry on this bike). Pressing the bolt with a finger and no shackle makes this obvious -- you can't push the pin in with the key fully in the unlocked position, only in a position where it doesn't stay by itself (almost fully unlocked). I also managed (off the bike, and only the first time) the get a shim into the relevant hole with the lock unlocked and jiggle everything to free it up. There's not much clearance to do this, the drinks can shim had to be bent just right. *It got worse while I tested it to write this post.
