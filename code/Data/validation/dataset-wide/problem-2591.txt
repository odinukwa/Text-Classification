Buddhists meet all the same problems as other beings. If not these problems, there would be no need in Buddhism. So the question is: what do you have to do to solve them? If our view on the world leans to aversion, it means our thoughts were focused mainly on unpleasant things. To explain that Buddha used to speak about six realms of samsara: 

Buddhism teaches to see the causes of problems. Then we can see what can be done to change those causes. Changing causes, we will change the results. Thus problems will be solved. Buddha Gautama explored the problem of suffering (dissatisfaction, dukkha), found the causes, and found that the causes can be changed, and how to do that. Basically our problems look like a vicious circle. Feeling dissatisfaction, we try to battle it with developing more positive feelings. But we do that with self-pressure, and as a result we get dissatisfied again. Think for example of chasing pleasures. We overuse sex, and then the penis hurts. We drink too much alcohol, trying to battle dissatisfaction, but we end up feeling hangover, weak and sick. We gamble, to get excitement, but that leads also to more losses and pains of heart. So what is the solution? Instead of fighting the fire of vexations by adding more vexations, we can rather stop and let them pacify. Our mind gets uncontrolled when it's tense. Because it's tense, it feels uncomfortable. Feeling uncomfortable, the mind wants to switch to something else, more pleasant. That's why habits of chasing desires get their rule over the mind. If we try to apply more force to control the mind, we probably add even more tension. The mind is already tense, so when we add even more tension, the problem might become even worse. That's the vicious circle, samsara. In order to stop it, we should drop chasing desires. We should accept what we feel, and let the tension dissipate. So we do not really want to control the mind, rather we try to help the mind to relax, and thus to regulate itself more naturally. We practice the Three Highest trainings: 

The difference in teachings is that Zen is based more on Mahayana ideas, such as Two Truths and Six Paramitas. (Theravada's interpretation of two truths and paramitas is very different from Nagarjuna's interpretation). In my experience, understanding of Two Truths (according to Mahayana) helps to abandon rigid ideas and develop insight; and the system of Six Paramitas helps to use daily deeds as practice. I'm not a specialist in Theravada, but I don't know there any similarly effective system. Finally, Zen emphasizes the reliance on direct prajna rather than on the scriptures. Perhaps that leads to wider use of various skillful means. As people are different, I prefer to not make generalizations comparing practitioners of Theravada and Zen. Though maybe dogmatic people are attracted more to Theravada, and nihilistic people are attracted more to Zen. Sometimes it seems so. 

If it is the essence, then how it can be with defilement? Does Buddha contain defilements in his essence? Sounds very strange. If it is pure by nature and is the ultimate truth, then how can it have defilements? So if we take Tathagatagarbha in the first sense, "Buddha-fetus which is in the earthly womb", then how can we understand Gyaltsab-Je? But if we take it in the second sense, "the womb with Buddha-fetus", then it becomes reasonable. The womb is "suchness with defilement" - "our impure reality". It is the womb where the Buddha-fetus resides. Though it might seem strange to call it "essence", that might point to a deep meaning. "Impure reality" is the essence of Buddha. How wonderful! But then, how can we understand that "ultimate truth" is "with defilement"? I understand the ultimate truth as "a place" where there is no duality of defilement or purity. There it can't be said it's with defilement. I understand the ultimate truth is the same as Buddha nature and the same as Dharmakaya. I'm planning to explain "Dharmakaya" in another answer, and then to add a link here; so now I just want to say the following: "Tathagatagarbha" and "Dharmakaya" are slightly different concepts, in the sense that they point at the same place - ultimate reality - from slightly different angles. In that regard, they are different. But the ultimate reality at which they both point at - is the same. In that regard they are not different. So it's not possible to say just "Tathagatagarbha and Dharmakaya are different" or "not different". They are both different and not different. 

I met many interesting people in dreams or in visions awake: Jesus, my old Zen teacher, some other Buddhist and Hindu teachers and so on. Some of them have told me very powerful mantras, some have encouraged me in practice or pointed at my mistakes. And of course I practised with them in my dreams, with joy and benefit. In none of those dreams or visions they deceived me in anything. My old Zen teacher said (when another practitioner asked him) that he doesn't visit his students in dreams. But, he said, it's possible that some local spirit might took his appearance and give helpful advice. Likewise, in your case it's possible that a local spirit took an image of the Buddha and gave you good advice. And it's possible it was real Buddha. There are known stories of advanced practitioners who saw awakened teachers in dreams or visions and learned from them a lot. For example, if I recall correctly, Je Tsongkhapa meditated in a temple with a statue of Atisha, and Atisha started to talk to him and elucidated many topics of Dharma, and that allowed Tsongkhapa to write his fundamental Lamrim. Of course it happens that our mind plays tricks with us, so it's possible to receive ill advice in dreams as well. Bodhisattvas can see Buddhas of Sambhogakaya realm (invisible to regular people), until then we have to decide for ourselves, was the advice good or not. ...Anyway, some people found excuses to not follow advice of real Buddha, when he was in human body... 

But there is a big difference: waves in the ocean have water beneath and wind above. So the surface is "material". Electromagnetic waves, however, don't have anything beneath and anything above. It's an imaginary surface. Now let us examine what is consciousness. We often imagine it as a result of contact of two things: 

We need to apply strength of our muscles if we want to throw a ball, but in order to actually throw it we also need to release our grip, and it's better to do that just in time. Memorize another advice from Master, which he admonished to apply both on retreats and in daily life: 

Then senses work very clearly, but without specific focusing on phenomena, no attachment arises. Thus from the contemplation not attaching to phenomena we explore and develop non-attached awareness. And then we can let go even the contemplation. Naturally not abiding, without loss of awareness, without generation of attachments. 

There are countless methods and approaches to calming the mind. Processes like anxious thinking repeat themselves over and over. So the question is how to stop that repetition. One of the simplest, widespread approaches is mindfulness of breathing. When we are overwhelmed by emotions, our breathing becomes fast and coarse. If we watch that, this awareness helps to calm down. First of all, we become aware of the tension in our breathing. If we have even minimal skills in relaxation (everybody has!), then we can calm down the tensions in our body. (Often it's contracted diaphragm and the like). So with love and attention we "send love" to the tense parts of our body. Wishing them to relax and to enjoy relaxation and calmness. As a result, excessive tensions of body relax, and emotional tensions calm down too - at least to a degree. Secondly, placing attention on breathing, we divert it from painful thoughts. It helps to let those thoughts extinguish. That principle of withdrawing our attention from vexations is common for very many methods of calming. My favorite is what I call Turtle Meditation. Did you see how turtles draw their paws and head under the shell? Likewise, to develop tranquility, we withdraw from the object our emotions, our thoughts and our wishes. It can be summarized in a brief phrase: "Don't feel, don't think, don't wish". Apply these three principles to the object that bothers you. Don't try to feel it, don't try to think about it, don't try to wish anything about it. Note that it doesn't mean we should escape the real world and build ourselves a cocoon. The method is just to cut off the process of re-generation of vexations. When a problem needs to be solved, do it, don't escape; but when unnecessary vexation repeats over and over, then you will know how to stop it. Maybe the only problem is that this method might seem counter-intuitive. We are used to think that concentration on our wish helps to fulfill it. Do you think so, right? Indeed, often concentration is exactly what we need to achieve our goals. But when all the necessary actions are performed, what next? Too often we remain concentrated on a problem - losing our time inefficiently, remaining tense, exhausting our body and especially our poor, self-torturing brain. Did you notice that sometimes our strong wishing actually blocks us from receiving what we want? Often it happens that we need to let the situation go - and then miraculously the fruit falls in our hands. As Master Sheng Yen said, memorize the Four Steps of solving problems:
