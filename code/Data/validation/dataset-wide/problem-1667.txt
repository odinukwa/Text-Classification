The article links to this datasheet provided by the IRS which details "an individual's income that is exempt from a notice of levy used to collect delinquent tax" for 2017. Note that these protections have been in place since at least 1977. 

Note, however, that the SALT deduction will not map uniformly to all of Trump's properties. Properties in high-tax states like New York would be hit hard, whereas properties in low tax states would not be affected at all. With the diverse locations of Trump's holdings, it would be difficult to calculate which locations would have the largest effect. Overall, this will most likely increase President Trump's tax burden, but it will still be useful to him. 

A cursory reading of the CDC report on uranium says, simply, the toxicity will kill you before the radiation does. So any possible consumption of uranium on the part of Mr. Winsor must have natually been low enough that he did not poison himself chemically, as evidenced by the fact that he was still alive to record the video. 

The main problem with statistics like these is that there is no one definition of "mass shooting" and thus, by adjusting your parameters, can make the number be whatever you want to fit a narrative. 

Additionally, this article describes an investigation where three NC state representatives and one state senator were found to have matching names and dates of birth with registered voters in other states. So while the original article used enough weasel words that it's not technically wrong, the scale of fraud it described is grossly exaggerated. 

So was there a pact? So the question now is whether Peter Raubal, Heiner Hochegger, and Alexander, Louis, Howard and Brian Stuart-Houston had a pact not to have children. This is where the book by David Gardner, and an accompanying article come in. The Stuart-Houstons (who live in New York) likely have had no connection to their cousins Peter and Heiner (who live in Europe), as their father very much wanted to distance himself from his family. Peter is also in his 80's and Heiner is in his late 60's. As neither of them have had children, it's possible they independently decided not to have any, but it's unlikely it was part of any sort of pact. Finally, that leaves the three living Stuart-Houstons - the ones most likely to have made a pact. Gardner writes: 

However, of the five example he gave, two were companies, one was a willful choice between offenses, and one is indeterminate. In none of these examples does he show why . All of these are highly unusual circumstances, most of which are not crimes for the people who executed them. It's possible he chose his examples poorly, but an introduction which fails to even address your thesis is a good indication that the thesis won't be addressed sufficiently in the rest of the work. 

The one lawsuit I could find was from 2004, Roy E. DISNEY, Plaintiff, v. The WALT DISNEY COMPANY, Defendant. 

The chemical weapons were destroyed as part of an international agreement between Russia and the United States. From the New York Times article above 

Pass-Through Business Tax A Pass-Through Business is a business structure where, instead of paying corporate tax rates, the profits of the business are passed through to the owners of the business, who then pay tax on these profits. The House plan proposes to lower this rate from 39.6% to 25%, while the Senate plan intends to allow filers to have an increase (23% from 17.4%) in the amount that is tax exempt. According to Donald Trump's own lawyers, most of his 500 companies he holds are sole proprietorships, and are pass-through companies. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities described this tax break as the "Trump Loophole". 

Roy Disney, nephew to founder Walt Disney was a stockholder of the company, holding a non-insignificant number of shares of the company itself (Wikipedia reports it as approximately 1% of the company at the time of his death, but the citation link is broken.) In 2004, upset at the results of a shareholder election, Mr. Disney sued The Walt Disney Company for access to voting records in the board election and the right to disseminate the information. 

It's a fact of life that almost no media coverage of poll results ever discusses the error margins. But that's where almost all the fluctuation in polling comes in. If one poll predicts a candidate will get 47% of the vote +/- 1%, and another predicts that candidate will get 52% of the vote +/- 5%, then when the second poll is released all the media coverage will be about how much the candidate's position has improved, even though the error margins are so high that (in the absence of any other information), the candidate is really getting closer to 48% of the vote (and is thus likely losing). Because exit polls have even higher error margins than normal polls, their numbers are that much less reliable. Error bars on statistical results are of huge importance. I can say right now, over a year out from the next presidential election, that the Republican candidate will receive 51% of the vote, +/- 49%. If the media were reporting on my prediction, they'd say that I said the as-yet-unnamed Republican was ahead... but I really said that it was way too uncertain to say anything at all (other than that the Republican will get votes, because my floor was 2% total). 

Taking the high estimate of this number, we can calculate the total Curies (amount of radioactivity) given off by this toxic waste as 

Furthermore, if the 7% number was correct, a $20,000 car after 6 years (a standard financing period for cars in the US would leave the car at 

While this is not as scientific as some of the other sources, Randall Munroe of XKCD posted a What If? article a few years ago regarding swimming in a radioactive fuel pool. Some of my initial research came from references in this article, but his conclusions are similar to mine. 

The source for the story linked within the Karl Hess Wikipedia page seems to be from the book "We Wonâ€™t Pay!: A Tax Resistance Reader" by Robert W. McGee and David M. Gross. The relevant section is from pages 437 to 438, reproduced here. 

Both the Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center quote Mr. Shabazz in saying the exact quote. However, there is no direct video evidence provided and there does not seem to be any direct proof of the event in question. Anti-Defamation League, page 8 

WebMD claims multiple sources in the article, but besides Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center I would not call any of the sources as reputable. 

Once the mail has been delivered to the person to whom it is addressed (and in the case of a spouse that could simply be bringing it into the house - no matter who does so), then opening it appears to be considered theft/destruction of personal property, rather than of mail. (source) 

I recently discovered that some people put Animal Planet (or similar nature channel) on the TV when leaving a cat alone all day. I'd never heard of this before, but I found many mentions of it while searching for more information. 

Note that "Other" deaths are violent too, but not included in my definition. You can see that using this definition, the IDF numbers for 2006, 2008, and 2011 are actually accurate. 2010 also matches if you include the 5 deaths by gunfire near Hebron (incident 1 incident 2). Thus claiming that it's just rocket fire is inaccurate. Also note that this analysis does not cross reference other sources. I don't know how accurate the B'Tselem information is, nor have I checked the IDF's offical numbers myself. 

Assuming that the sources are correct, there's no truth to this legend, because the "paper" name wasn't introduced until long after the game had spread out of China. 

Before I begin, I will preface this by saying that the tax plans passed by the House and Senate are different, and both houses need to come together in order to reconcile differences in their respective plans. This answer was last updated 7 December 2017, and may be inaccurate as changes to the bills go through. I will update further as we know more about what the final bill that passes to the President's desk is. Since Donald Trump has not divested from his company holdings, we will make the assumption that he still benefits from tax code changes that involve his business dealings. Also note that I am leaving parts of the tax code out that would have an obviously negligible or zero impact on his taxes (Medical expense deduction, Teacher Supply Deduction, Individual Mandate Repeal.) 

Compare this to the numbers provided by "Comparing the Amount of Radioactivity Found in Radioactive Wastes" 

However, the book itself is not quoted directly and there are not any sources online that could be used to prove or disprove that the book is even properly cited. 

While the numbers provided by the sources seem to be strictly correct, they are lacking a significant amount of context. Once this context is injected into the discussion, the manufacture of Wind Turbines does not create as much radiation as Nuclear waste. 

It's often said among skeptics (and scientists in general) that "Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence". In this case, the evidence is really quite weak. For the park example, for instance, it would have been trivial for the mother to have taken the children to a park with a friend, and to have said to the friend's parent something along the lines of "I don't like this park as much as the one that Jacqueline used to play in". One of the children, overhearing that, could then have asked to go to "the other park". Since the mother was primed to believe in the daughters' reincarnation, she'd then interpret that as "It's a park they'd never been to before!" rather than simply assuming the child heard of it from someone. Five years later, when she's retelling the story to Stevenson, she no longer remembers her off-hand comment to her friend, and only remembers the request. Whether that's an accurate scenario, there's no way to say. But it's a plausible one, which is enough to require further proof of the extraordinary claims being made. 

This builds on the first point. Exit polls are unreliable, and (for reasons discussed below) lean Democratic. Thus if the unreliable numbers are skewed one way, then the actual results will appear to be skewed the other in comparison. Thus what's really happening is not that the votes are suddenly going more red than they should, but the exit polls are bluer than they should be. 

The IRS supposedly was communicating with Mr. Hess via mail. However, despite paper records of this correspondence, there seems to be no proof offered besides the word of Mr. Hess. The IRS never told Mr. Hess that he "no longer would be permitted to possess money" With the attached IRS form above, the IRS is not permitted to put a lien on 100% of a person's income, and written correspondence would be proof of this threat. There is no discussion detailed in the book where Mr. Hess tells the IRS "without money he could not buy food and would soon die". The whole incident was started because Mr. Hess decided he did not want to pay taxes anymore after being audited. Mr. Hess, in the book, believed that he was audited in retaliation for "his service to a losing presidential candidate." Note that Mr. Hess was not an advisor, or a close aide, but a speechwriter for Barry Goldwater. Also note that the audit rate around that time, according to this article, was 5.6% of all Americans. There is no indication that, even if all of the above were true, that the IRS actually garnished 100% of his wages.
