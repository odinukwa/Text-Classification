Another possibility is that the "shaking" you are seeing is due to the (expected!) wheel unbalance. No bike wheels are truly balanced the way a car wheel would be. Weight doesn't matter for car wheels, so those wheels are balanced by adding weights to the rim. On bikes, the forces are lower and saving weight is more important, so we don't bother. This means that the tire valve and reflector, however light, are enough to noticeably unbalance the wheel. When you allow the wheel to spin freely off the ground, this imbalance causes the wheel, drive train, and even possibly the whole bike to shimmy a bit. But don't worry! This has absolutely no effect once you actually put it on the ground and start riding it. 

As others have mentioned, for such short rides comfort will likely not be a major concern in the same way it would for endurance events, "bikepacking", or even racing. That's not to say you shouldn't consider comfort at all - a bad saddle or bad bike fit can make things hurt in a hurry. But these are things that can be easily adjusted to make any one of hundreds of bike models work, and you shouldn't need to optimize your comfort beyond pinning down those basics. That said, I wanted to address the underlying assumption within your question: that some frame materials are fundamentally "more comfortable" than others. While it is true that it is generally easier to make some materials feel comfortable, in the end comfort, or whatever performance metric you choose to focus on, is the result of complex interactions between the materials, the geometry (both rider geometry and tube shapes), and the construction of the frame. With clever enough, or poor enough, engineering you can make any material feel harsh or compliant, stiff or flimsy, responsive or sluggish. Ultimately, the best and really only way to determine whether a particular bike will feel good for you is to test ride it. Here is a good video by GCN on carbon vs aluminium frames 

When in doubt, the best is to try the bike. Dimensions are important from an anthropometric point of vue especially to prevent injuries and such. So in that perspective if you're kind of in-between sizes the choice will be guided by your sensations. I know cyclists that prefer oversize and others that prefer undersize, it depends on how much you lean on the bike and that kind of factors. So the best way to do it is to spot the extremities on your size spectrum and try bikes that match, you will feel what is natural for you. I personnaly ride an old steelframe oversized roadbike and it's feels awesome. 

I depends on quite a lot of little things. First there is the weight repartition of your bike, think of it as a hammer : if the hammerhead is up high it will be difficult for you to vertically put it on a table in terme of stability but if the hammer upside is down it's not a problem. This is due to some lever phenomenon occuring and there is the same thing when you're on your bike. It's mainly because even if you're light you're still the heavier part of it. Now the thing with weight repartition is that's it's linked to efficiency because of the fact that it's your speed that makes the balance, the harder the balance to find the more energy you need. This applies to every bike but the lighter you are the easier it is to have good weight repartition. (because 10kg+50kg is very not the same as 10kg + 80kg since you can't transfer your own weight) So then again it's marginal but if your bike has good vertical weight repartition this should work for you and not against you and it's more easy to find. Secondly there is the momentum issue, the higher you weight the less equilibrium you have but you get more momentum, that means that to a attain a good regime in some circumstances you will have to burn more energy under a certain weight. There also is an equilibrium to find because if you are too heavy it's the same thing, the momentum is harder to find. So i'd say the lighter is not necessarily the absolute best, it depends on your general condition and gaining or losing weight depends on that. For the rest there still is some technical aerodynamics to do on you machine but I dout this alone would make you gain 10mph. 

Yes, it is possible that the tires are sized differently. Tire manufacturers have become much more consistent in their sizing, but there are still small variations. Part of the issue lies in the fact that tire profile changes slightly depending on the rim it is affixed to. Essentially, a narrower rim will result in a larger outer diameter and a narrower profile while a wider rim will result in the tire having a smaller diameter and wider profile. But since there is no standard rim size in the bike industry, upon which rim size do you base your measurements? Different tire manufacturers have settled on what they believe to be the 'best' or 'most true', but with no consensus, there's bound to be some inconsistency. But that's not all. There's also a historical precedent (admittedly much diminished in the past couple of decades) of tire manufacturers intentionally LYING about their tire sizing. Why would this occur? Because having the lightest tire is a sales point. But what if your tire isn't actually the lightest one out there? Well, maybe your 23 is lighter than the lightest 25, and no one's going to pull out the calipers to actually CHECK. So, just change the number on the sidewall and happily claim to be the lightest "x25" tire in the world. Interesting historical oddity: Why do we call tires that fit on 622mm rims "700c" (actual outer diameter ~660mm) and tires that fit on 571mm rims "650c" (actual outer diameter ~610mm)?

The ideal for everyday washing is jetwash, it's relatively cheap (in France there are spots where you can do that for 50cts), it's ecological, it's quick and there is no problem for the machine. For more drastic washing what I do is I go straight for acetone. You don't need much of it but it's great for the grease/brake dust deposits, even for wheels (you maybe want to remove the tires before doing the wheels but except for that no problem). It's less costly than wipes, less complicated (because wipes tend to shred on some parts which is tricky) and you don't need much of it so it's not that bad for the planet (since it's for yearly/bi-yearly cleaning) 

Your freewheel seems busted from what you say, it happens when the cogs are worn, nothing much to do there. Everything is reparable but it sometimes takes a lot of time for not a lot of gain. Question is what is the value of your wheelcircle and from picture i'd say that's and old aluminium one. I don't know how that is where you live but in my neighborhood you can get a "brand new" used one for under 5 bucks. If the freewheel is busted you have to replace the entire bearing, meaning you have to take the entire wheel apart and then do the spoking from scratch. If you have a bit of experience and tools that is a good 1-2 hours of work, if it's your fist time count merely your sunday afternoon on it. So my conclusion is : get a new wheel and recycle this one into an artistic project of some sort :) 

This is likely caused by your one of your derailleurs (probably rear) being very slightly out of alignment, which is not unsurprising for a new bike. Cables tend to stretch slightly* during the break in period on the bike and they're responsible for keeping the derailleurs aligned. This is a large part of the reason that bike shops will encourage you to bring the bike back in after the break in; it's expected that the breaks and shifters will need some tweaking at that point. In the mean time, as long as it isn't ghost shifting and you aren't too bothered by the noise itself, I wouldn't worry myself about it. The bike will be fine for the few days until you get the service done. *Interestingly, "cable stretch" is a bit of a misnomer. In fact, most of the change is caused by the cable housing compressing under load. The end result is the same, however, and describing it as "cable strech" is more intuitive to most people. 

Technology does trickle down the price tiers over the years, but it takes a few generations for new mid-tier groupsets to overtake the performance of older groupsets from a higher tier - usually it only happens with a "breaking change" - going from 10 to 11 speed, introducing hydraulic disk brakes as a groupset option, etc. Also keep in mind that each generation stays current for 3-4 seasons before being replaced. Given that, it is possible that some of the cheaper bikes may be using the last generation of 105, but as long as it is only one generation back you are still getting better components than current year Tiagra. Two generations back will be roughly comparable. At three or more, you're probably better off with new Tiagra, but at that point you're looking at decade old components - no new bike will come with such old componentry. Edit: I just found this full history of Dura-Ace releases. While it's obviously representative of Shimano's latest and greatest and doesn't directly reflect how quickly that new tech trickles down, I think it still gives a good sense for how quickly change does, and doesn't, progress in groupset technology.
