Hard to call if avoiding a direct land engagement was intentional by the Romans (This was before the Fabian strategy was used vs Hannibal where the Romans intentionally avoided a direct battle with Hannibal), however the end result was the majority of the mercenaries survived the Punic war to return to Carthage where they would demand pay. 

The downside of the elephant 'super weapon' was they were as dangerous to friendly forces as they were to the enemy. A few rampaging elephants can completely disorganize an army and the resulting chaos is a walk over for the enemy army. I also suspect the Carthaginians were always struggling for manpower. They heavily used mercenaries and wiki contains lines like this: 

The wiki page on graphite contains a bit on it, ultimately this discovery came well before (200 years) graphite was considered something different than 'black lead' $URL$ 

They did to some degree, though it was in large part because of how they approached war. The Roman armies were professionals, men of a certain age that could enter the army for pay and glory. The 'Barbarians' were not a professional army in this manner, they were not raising armies to march outwards, they were fighting for their very right to exist as people. As such, their armies were composed of the women and youth that would not be a part of the Roman army which saw their numbers rise significantly higher than the Romans numbers were. Many Roman conquests acknowledged such: 

England went through a few invasions (Saxon, Anglo-Saxon, Danish, and Viking) that saw some exceedingly brutal practices. Jury is still out and there are a few competing theories, but it's quite possible Roman-English descendants experienced what we would now refer to as genocide. $URL$ 

Whether he was there or simply had access to someone else's numbers is debated in a few contexts, but his numbers were accurate for the most case. As for the other portions...you find a mixed bag of internet debate on the topic. He is widely agreed upon as exaggerating and story telling, though it's not easy to tell how much of his story is fiction vs non-fiction, in good part due to their not being other works to readily compare him to. Oddly enough I can find a few references that suggest he was a Jewish apologist struggling between pleasing his Roman overlords and while trying to display Judiasm in a positive light $URL$ 

The mercenaries found like minded African subjects of Carthage and the mercenary war began. As an interesting side note...the Punic wars was actually initiated by Mercenaries dragging Carthage and Rome into conflict. A group of mercenaries known as the Mamertines was employed by the Greek city state of Syracuse to fight vs the Carthaginians. The Greeks were defeated and when the self-proclaimed king died, the majority of his mercenaries found themselves unemployed on the island of Sicily. The town of Messana let the mercs in and the mercs betrayed them and slaughtered the population turning the town from a small farm town into a raiding base. The new king of Syracuse saw this threat and marched against the Mamertines and defeated them. The Mamertines plead with both Carthage and Rome for help, ultimately bringing Rome and Carthage into the conflict known as the first Punic War. 

The name urnfield derives from this peoples burial rights (cremating remains, putting ashes in urns, and burying them)...so best chance you are going to have of identifying borders will be found in identifying these urns in excavations. As such, Urnfield is less of a people group and more of a cultural grouping (ie, the practice of burying urns spread across multiple peoples). Cultural grouping tend to have very fuzzy borders. I will use this link for the quotes below : $URL$ 

I suspect that as the conflict extended it transitioned to more of a war of attrition where the Romans superior financing and logistics started to shine through. They overcame several defeats, only to come back stronger for the next battle while it appears Carthage struggled to replace it's losses. This sentiment is also echoed in the final naval engagement (Battle_of_the_Aegates) with wiki having such lines as: 

You are correct, however it should be noted that the Bering strait would have been significantly warmer. Theres a few links I can refer to, but this is the best: $URL$ The Bering Strait being open to water flow vs closed impacts our globes climate heavily. In particular: 

It should be noted that it resembles lead ore, not lead...which would presumably weigh a bit less. Wonder if I have my old mineral test kit. Some properties one tests for in identifying a substance: Hardness. Graphite and Lead are both 1.5 on Moh's hardness scale ($URL$ This meant not only did it have the same coloring, it had the same softness to it. Streak. Both graphite and lead leave a streak on a streak plate. Magnetism : Both lead and Graphite also show very similar behavior in the presence of a magnet, not magnetic but interacting with a magnetic field. Graphite actually has a few properties that are quite misleading, as it is simply a carbon arrangement yet still acts as a 'semimetal' and operates as a semi-conductor. Until you get into more advanced forms of chemical testing, lead and graphite behave much the same. 

Yep. And potentially intentionally. Prior to the first world war, the British subscribed to a balance of power model of policy with the idea that a united (or conquered) Europe under one banner would be an existential threat to Britain and therefore it was in Britains best interest to maintain the balance of power between opposing forces on mainland Europe. The Ottoman empire was a beneficiary of this policy as a weak Ottoman empire could be overrun by the Russians who would be in turn strong enough to cut into the Austrians and the rest of Europe. The policy actually saw the UK declare war on Russia. The treaty of Sevres was formulated in that mindset...divide the territory and power up and ensure a single entity didn't have all the power. I think the power of the Turkish nationalist movement was either ignored or badly under estimated...as long as one European nation didn't 'own' the former body of the now defunct Ottoman empire, I don't think the drafters of the Treaty of Sevres cared what their lines did beyond that...if the Ottoman lands were to be conquered, the aggressor would now need to declare war on the allies in their entirety. Just to add a bit more: The treaty conditions here were far more punishing than the treaty of Versailles and was entirely done to setup a 'puppet' nation where the allies (mainly France and Britain, but Italy as well) would control the territories finances, trade, and resources. The Treaty of Sevres was as much as anything, an attempt to divide the spoils of war (the former ottoman empire) to the allies (keeping in mind that this included Iraqi oil for the British). 

Question has been altered, so my answer is less relevant. At any rate, TLDR: No, this policy was obsolete by 1925-1935 and I'm unable to find anything that would suggest it was a reasonable policy in the lead up to WWII (you can find some traces post-WWI such as the treaty of Sevres to split the ottoman empire, but thats the last instance I can find). The policy worked when the opposing forces were empires and nations, but found it's end when the powers were more divided between Democracy, Fascism, and Communism. Only instance of this Balance of power strategy I can find for this time frame fits into what I describe below. To stop the downvotes my answer is directed to the original question having linked to $URL$ that is written by Nikolay Starikov that directly states the US and British intentionally rebuilt the Germans after WWI to attack Russia (as Starikov puts it "because they don't like to fight the Russians themselves". The idea that Britain used 'the balance of power' strategy to rebuild Nazi Germany to attack Russia is often promoted under 'European balance of power during 1925-35' and is fringe conspiracy at best. Started as a comment, now appears to be lengthy enough to try as an answer. I'm suspecting this question would do better on skeptics than History. The article you are linking as "This page" and question if there is a better source is written by Nikolay STARIKOV. He is the founder of the Goebbels Award, given to "people who lie about, slander and vilify Russia". The Guardian actively identifies him as a conspiracy theorist that seeks to promote Russia and Demonize western culture (How the Western Culture is brainwashed by the it's media is amoung his works). $URL$ Nikolay STARIKOV is also accredited to statements like this : 

This is only correct with an assumption...a gun is inferior to a bow in the hands of a trained bowman. Given to an untrained person, a gun is superior in pretty much every manner. Archery tended to be a lifestyle, especially in England, where a person would learn to use a bow in their youth and hone the skill over many years of practice. Raising archers for your army from a populace that had this background was a relatively quick process. However it took a significant amount of time to raise archers from a population that didn't have this cultural background. Reversely a standing garrison can be given guns with a little training and be ready within a month or two. Should put a side note in that the Native Americans did in fact face 'armored' beasts. A gun was capable of dropping a Bison far simpler than arrows ever would and was a superior tool when used for hunting big game. Not all weapon acquisition was for war. 

Lack of Russian expertise. Unlike the nations that had already circumnavigated the globe, the Russians badly lacked naval experience in both manpower and shipbuilding (techniques and resources). Peter the Great visited Amsterdam and learned of the resources required to build ships (and dispatched convoys to a few other places/people such as the Knight Templar on Malta) and construction of the Russian fleet would depend on outside expertise (people such as $URL$ Most Russian sailors were fishermen and really only proficient around coastal waters and not in the open ocean Fleet locations and existing conflicts. Peter the Great had to contend with the Swedish in the Baltic seas (great northern wars) and the Ottoman empire in the black sea. The majority of his shipbuilding resources was dedicated to these conflicts, making it difficult to justify the resources on circumnavigating the globe. The White Sea port was really their only port they could depart from that wouldn't require travelling through hostile waters before hitting the open ocean. Need. The number 1 reason to circumnavigate the globe was to find an alternate route to India and China and bypass the giant landmass that was Russia. Being that Russia already had land routes to India and a common border with China, the need wasn't there in the same manner. Even more so that Russia already possessed pacific ports, it was simpler to construct there than to sail around the world. Russia also possesses vast amounts of land and natural resources, which was another driving factor behind the more sea faring nations setting out. 

As a finance note...it appears the victorious Romans sold the entire population of Agrigentum (25k people) into slavery. Probably helped the pocket books a bit, but it became a rallying point for the Carthage soldier (remember the Alamo style) There isn't much out there for tactics used and the actual engagement is a bit of a mystery, but I imagine this line holds a lot of weight: 

A few answers have pointed out the relative ease that you can get to England, so I won't go that route with this answer. I'll go with wealth and militancy, along with some revenge. England could be recognized as an easier conquest during this time frame, repeated war and intervention from a variety of sources left England relatively weak to foreign invasion. Æthelred and several 'pre-england' kings paid massive ransoms to the Danish (referred to as 'Danegold'), the isle was truly ripe for the pickings and they had the wealth to pick. Reversely, much of the Germanic tribes to the south were much more nomadic and lacked the wealth to pay such ransoms. There is also some politics involved here. Francia was the frankish nation within Europe and at it's hieght under Charlemagne had occupied everything in now current day France, to Italy, and Germany. They had defeated superior foes such as the Umayyad Caliphate and would put up tough resistance to invaders. Ragnar Lodbrok invaded Francia and had general success, but eventually made his way up to England after some tribute and military stalemates (Siege of Paris (885–86)). King Ælla of Northumbria captured and killed Ragnar (pit of snakes is the legend). In the name of revenge, The Great Heathen Army (mostly Danish Vikings) attacked England and would eventually settle there. Oddly, this revenge over the killing of Ragnar by an pre-English king was likely a good reason they hit England as hard as they did. Poland - This wasn't an easy target like you suggest...home to the Goths, a semi-nomadic people that were extremely warrior like, would put up a big fight and present little wealth to the victors. Scythia - There is much lost history here, but if you go into lithuania and further south, you find the Scythian peoples. $URL$ These were also a nomadic people with not as much wealth to plunder, but also a heavily warlike people that gave rise to the legendary Amazon warriors. Considered by many (Roman/Greek sources) to be warriors without equals (from the link ""No invader who comes against the Scythians can ever escape and none can catch them if they do not wish to be caught.“ – Herodotus"). To get to any real wealth, one would have to venture as far south as Byzantine and Constantinople (which the Swedish vikings did, becoming the Varangian guard). To your question:
