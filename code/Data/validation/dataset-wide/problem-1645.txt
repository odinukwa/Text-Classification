Mountain Dew, the soda in question, is widely attested to contain phosphoric acid and have an acidity of pH=3.2 to 3.3.¹ A pH of 3.3 is a fairly strong acidity. The acidity of a liquid is a good predictor of its corrosivity (specifically, its ability to destroy body tissue). Even teeth can be dissolved; demineralization of teeth begins at pH 5.5.² Barring actual tests of the effect of a pH 3.2 to 3.3 bath upon the flesh of a mouse, we must look for something similar. The safety data sheet for Mountain Dew is also not available, although presumably the bottling plants would have to make one available to employees. A Draise skin test of a similarly acidic solution of 30% hydrogen peroxide in water (pH 3.3) gives a Severe result.³ The solution must be marked as Corrosive, Packing Group II for the purpose of transportation, meaning the liquid is known to cause full thickness destruction of intact skin tissue in less than 60 minutes.⁴ Similarly, a solution of phosphoric and hydrofluoric acid diluted to pH 3.3 is known to do the same.⁵ What will happen to the rest of the mouse over a > 1 year period I leave to your imagination. But the effect we are looking for according to the pathologist's claim is not about the body tissue. It is demineralization of the mouse over a 15 month period: bones and teeth being dissolved, leaving behind a rather gelatinous, soft mass. For this purpose, we can look at a study published by the Academy of General Dentistry, which showed that tooth enamel (the hardest mineral tissue of the body) bathed in Mountain Dew dissolves at a rate of about 4.2% per 2 days.⁶ At that rate, the halflife of tooth enamel would be about one month. 99% of tooth enamel would be dissolved in 6 months. However, and this is an important point, the acid in the can is a fixed quantity, and would be neutralized over time by the dissolved minerals, so the demineralization of the mouse would not be as rapid as predicted. The equilibrium point depends on several unknowns, but we can make a start on it. The mass of the acids in Mountain Dew is probably similar to the mass of the acids in many soft drinks. We know that Coca-Cola has about 0.055% phosphoric acid.⁷ Although there will also be citric acid in the product, we can use it as a conservative lower bound and assume that Mountain Dew has at least 0.2 grams of acids. If a skeleton is 10 to 20% of the weight of a 10 to 20 gram mouse, then you have 1 to 4 grams of bone to dissolve. 

Those are my answers, at a glance. Now comes the justification. First, we need to make it clear that we are talking about 'average' people (as per the question) not outliers. An average person who takes up sprinting can train and improve - but WILL NOT EVER run as fast as Usain Bolt. It's safe to say that because, empirically we see that the world's best runners cannot run as fast as Usain Bolt. Second, I'm really not sure this question should be on this site. It's easy to say X did Y but it's very hard to say it is physically impossible for X to do Y. Can some ficticious guy run a four minute mile? Well, there was a time when nobody had - and some people argued it was impossible for medical reasons, while other people argued it was achievable. Then some guy did it; but he was the only one. Now world class athletes can do it. But what does that mean for the hypothetical question of 'Can some guy run a four minute mile'? So, I'm doing my best to answer this question with actual data - but it does get pretty speculative. Hopefully someone else can do a better job. Let's have a look at Arnold I think it's really important to clarify what we're talking about when you say 'Like Arnold'. Let's try to get some perspective. Arnold is one of the world's most successful body builders. He won The Mr. Universe three years in a row and the Mr. Olympia six years in a row. He was also a world-class, competitive power-lifter, taking first in the International Powerlifting championships and the German Powerlifting Championships. 

I would be very surprised if it did not cause earthquakes. Back in 1993, the Dutch established that even conventional gas exploitation causes earthquakes up to a magnitude of 3.5. Since a 2.3 earthquake is 16 times weaker, it's quite believable that you could get such an earthquake even with experimental drilling. 

260 degrees is almost unreachable. Water of course boils at 100 degrees, keeping the temperature down. When cooking with fats and oils, you always keep the temperature below the smoke point. Those are generally below 260 degrees, except for some rare oils. Even then, you rarely heat oil just for the sake of it: there's usually something in the oil, and that will burn. This will produce acrylamide (a cancer-causing chemical) at temperatures well below 260 degrees. The real risk is an empty pan. Heating that will cause a quick rise in temperature, as there's nothing to keep the inside cool. For toxicity, I'll assume human toxicity. I don't think the danger to birds is disputed. As is usual with toxicity, the important part is the dose. Here we see a bit of a problem with the EWG site linked in the quqestion: they're using scare tactics. Their standard for doses is "have been detected". Not medical risk. The FDA continues to list Teflon as "safe for cooking" As for "other chemicals being released", it's hard to measure this. Cooking releases hundreds, if not thousands of different chemicals. Many of them you can smell; you'd call them "flavors" or "aroma's". Non-stick pans are hardly unique in this respect. 

Controls weight, combats a whole slew of negative health conditions/diseases (arthritis, diabetes, osteoprosis, obesity, back pain, depression), increases muscle mass, improves sex life, and promotes better sleep. So I mean that's pretty good right? Reason enough for any tall/skinny guy to head to the gym! But I feel like that's not what you're looking for. Still, I'm having a lot of trouble finding sources that seem appropriate for this site. You can find a lot of different formulas online that will claim to tell you how much lean mass you can 'naturally' support. You'll notice that they all give slightly different results and most of them don't explain or justify the methodologies used in their creation. 

In Arnold's own words, 'It was what I had to do to compete'. This would strongly suggest that Arnold probably could not have achieved his physique without drugs. Bottom line is, EVEN WITH STEROIDS, none of the world-class, professional body-builders could obtain a physique like Arnold's. Arnold still dominated the sport. Yes he used drugs too. We can't say with absolute certainty that Arnold without drugs couldn't obtain his physique - but we can say he didn't do it and that he believes he couldn't have. Arnold himself, who without drugs was a world-class powerlifter, most likely couldn't obtain his physique without drugs. You'd need to be an extreme outlier and take drugs to get the physique that Arnold is famous for. What About Our Tall/Skinny Guy Okay fine - so we're not going to look like Arnold, with or without drugs. But what can a tall/skinny guy hope to achieve by working out? Well, there are lots of health benefits... 

Iowa Driving Simulator studied reaction times in "Driver Reaction Time In Crash Avoidance Research: Validation Of a Driving Simulator Study On a Test Track". This study found that when a sudden threat appears, the timeline for driver reaction was: 

So suppose the driver in front of you suddenly slams on the brakes. If the reaction times found by this study are typical, you will reach maximum braking around 3.16 seconds later. Other things being equal, you will collide with the vehicle in front of you if you are less than 3.16 seconds behind it. The study cites other studies of collision avoidance behavior. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration looked at the relationship between following distances and accident rates, which you specifically asked about, in "A Front-End Analysis of Rear-End Crashes". This study identified "following too closely" as a principal causal factor in 1 out of 5 rear-end crashes but did not say what their criterion of "too closely" was. If the data provided in this study are reliable, about 162,000 people are injured annually by insufficient following distance, and 600 people are killed. 

To answer the second part (and A.Rex's comment), humans sweat a lot. In addition, we're hairless and breathe through the mouth. This all helps to dump heat, which is one of the most limiting factors. It's thought this helped in scavenging (run to a carcass if you sport vultures, before they eat it) and later hunting. If you eliminate heat as a factor, e.g. by staging a run in Wales, horses generally do better. 

Well, the linked article is rather clear: With up to 50 grams of HFCS consumed at .5 microgram, the daily intake would be 25 microgram. Mercury is a danger to unborn children [...] if they are exposed to low dose microgram exposures. This is of course a worst-case scenario. The same chlor-alkali chemicals are increasingly produced without mercury at all, which would explain why some batches of HFCS had no detectable mercury at all (11 out of 20). Another relevant comparison might be to fish, where the limit is one microgram of mercury per gram of fish (1 ppm). The concentrations found in HFCS are significantly less than that, even in the worst case. So, there is a scientific basis for the claim, although the details (often contains toxic levels of mercury) are still dubious. 

You're asking a lot of questions and they aren't as specific as they probably should be for a site like this. Let me just cut to the chase, and then try to justify my answers. 

He was competing against the other best body builders in the world and he consistently beat them. That means, all of the professional body builders competing in the Mr. Olympia, for six consecutive years, were unable to obtain the physique as good as Arnold's. But let's talk about drugs. The question specifically asks about what we can achieve without drugs.... The truth is, Arnold took steriods. He admits it. The people he was competing against also took steroids. Many of them weren't illegal or banned at the time. '...the use of anabolic steroids was openly discussed partly due to the fact they were legal...'
