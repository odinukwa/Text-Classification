I would like to see RSA encryption included somehow, ideally in a hands-on way (letting them do some arithmetic with aid of calculators which are part of the exhibit) so that people can get the sense that whenever there is an https:// in their browser, a lot of simple but remarkable arithmetic is happening in the background. 

An exhibit - with both individual workstations and one whose results are projected (to draw people in) - where users use parallelograms to specify affine transformations which in turn define Iterated Function Systems and their associated fractals. See here for background. With a few moves/ clicks a user can start making fractal ferns, clouds, spirals and starfish as well as classical objects such as the Sierpinski gasket. It is great because you don't have to know anything to start making pretty pictures, but you immediately get a sense that there is something significant going on. For those who want to see beyond the pretty pictures, one could explain the contraction mapping theorem (terrific fun in its own right) and develop affine-linear transformations starting with rotations, scalings and translations. Trying to find the transformations which define a particular fractal by "finding enough smaller copies of the fractal to cover the fractal" is also great fun, which is compelling even for children. 

I have two such open exposition questions which I hope to address some day (alas, I have a long list of both mathematical research and pedagogical problems which are all worthy of attention - but this kind of question is fun because it is at the intersection of these areas). One is giving a cochain-level treatment of Poincar√© duality through intersection theory and then using that to give geometric, cochain level refinements of much of "intermediate" algebraic topology: wrong-way maps, characteristic classes, Thom isomorphism, Steenrod operations, Eilenberg-Moore spectral sequence. A second is to treat loop spaces and classifying spaces in a more unified way, from scratch (course title: "Loop, de-loop.") This would expand on my little expository paper on Koszul duality. 

You (and "everyone") may already know this, but there is a really simple answer to a variant of your question, that is when instead of starting with a Lie algebra you start with a connected differential graded Lie algebra over a field of characteristic zero. In that case, Quillen's work on rational homotopy theory says that data determines a rational homotopy type, and Lie algebra cohomology is the cohomology of that homotopy type. So that answer to your question is that two (connected differential graded) Lie algebras with the same cohomology have the same kind of relationship to one another as two spaces which have isomorphic cohomology rings... which is not necessarily much unless you know something more about them. To some small extent Lie algebras when viewed as differential graded Lie algebras in degree zero (with trivial differential) are analogous to K(G,1)'s, but general theory says little there, so I don't think this addresses your main question. Those interested in an elementary, expository topologist's view of Koszul duality might want to look at this. 

As a topologist, my view is that group cohomology of interest to number theorests seems to generally be with non-trivial module coefficients. Many of the tricks topologists employ to study spaces do not apply in this setting, and indeed there are some topologists whose view is that once the coefficients are non-trivial then one is "just doing algebra." But attitudes can change: cohomology of profinite groups was perhaps viewed similarly, but in the "chromatic" (number theoretic) framework for stable homotopy, cohomology of profinite groups figures prominently. For this reason, some topologists work hard to show that techniques which work for finite groups pass sensibly to the profinite settings. 

These chain complexes are modeling a standard construction in equivariant homotopy theory. Let $S^\infty$ have the standard $S^1$ action (this is a model for what is called $ES^1$) and add a disjoint basepoint, denoting the result $S^\infty_+$. There is a cofiber sequence $S^\infty_+ \to S^0 \to \widetilde{S^\infty}$, which defines the last space. Now smash that cofiber sequence with the space ${\rm Map}(S^\infty_+, X)$ and take $S^1$ fixed sets. That is consider the (stable - we'll need that later) $S^1$ fixed sets of $$S^\infty_+ \wedge {\rm Map}(S^\infty_+, X) \to S^0 \wedge {\rm Map}(S^\infty_+, X) \to \widetilde{S^\infty} \wedge {\rm Map}(S^\infty_+, X). $$ In the middle one of course has the space of $S^1$-equivariant maps from $ES^1$ to $X$, which are the "homotopy fixed sets." In general the fixed sets $X^{S^1}$ can be viewed as the $S^1$-equivariant maps from a point to $X$ (or in the based case here a "pointed point", that is $S^0$), and since $ES^1$ is contractible but with a free $S^1$-action this ends up being a "more homotopy invariant" analogue to fixed sets. The chain complex version of this is to take equivariant homomorphisms from the chains on $S^\infty_+$ to a given $V$, which yields $V[[t]]$. Next, smashing with $\widetilde{S^\infty}$ is the colimit of smashing with $\widetilde{S^{2n + 1}}$ and in homology each map in this colimit is multiplication by the Euler class of the standard representation of $S^1$ (viewed as a bundle over a point) so this is a localization by inverting that Euler class, yielding $V((t))$. Finally, smashing with $S^\infty_+$ yields an equivalence when one smashes with an equivariant map which is a non-equivariant homotopy equivalence (sometimes called weak equivariant equivalences - but I might prefer "really weak"). Thus since $S^\infty_+ \to S^0$ is a really weak equivariant equivalence so is $X \cong {\rm Map}(S^0, X) \to {\rm Map}(S^\infty_+, X)$ and thus the left hand term is (strongly) equivariantly homotopy equivalent to $S^\infty_+ \wedge X$. Stably (sorry I do not have time/space to elaborate), the fixed sets of this are equivalent to the quotient $(ES^1_+ \wedge X)/S^1$. This is exactly what one should mean by "homotopy coinvariants" - smashing with $ES^1$ and then taking the quotient (that is, the coinvariants). In the world of chain complexes since this is a cofiber sequence one gets the model you describe. In summary, if you are familiar with a more general story in equivariant homotopy theory then this construction on chain complexes makes sense. If you're strongly interested in $S^1$-equivariant homotopy theory, I would recommend Greenlees's book "Rational $S^1$-equivariant stable homotopy theory", though you really need to know some stable homotopy theory to begin with. You still might want to know where these constructions all come from, for which the short answer is that Tate first noticed that one could splice together group homology and cohomology to get a coherent theory. Later people (tom Dieck? Segal?) noticed that theory had to do with localization and then folks like Greenlees and May developed space-level constructions (which yield versions of Tate theory in any generalized cohomology theory, including K-theory which is a lot of fun). 

The E and H maps in the EHP sequence have models that aren't too hard to define. To review, the E map is induced on homotopy by $E: \Omega^n S^n \to \Omega^{n+1} S^{n+1}$ sending a map to its suspension. The H map has a nice model once one knows about James's theorem that $\Sigma \Omega \Sigma X$ splits as $\bigvee_i \Sigma X^{\wedge i},$ where $X^{\wedge i}$ is $X$ smashed with itself $i$ times. When $X$ is $S^n$ one has $\Sigma \Omega S^{n+1}$ then projects onto the "quadratic" wedge factor $\Sigma (S^n)^{\wedge 2} \cong S^{2n + 1}$. The adjoint of this map is $H : \Omega S^{n+1} \to \Omega S^{2n + 1}$. My question is "what about $P$"? That is, what is a model for this map? As I understand it, the usual approach is to show that $E$ and $H$ fit into a fiber sequence (when localized at two, or integrally through a range(?)) and then $P$ is the connecting map. I was disappointed to learn that despite its name $P$ only coincides with a Whitehead product in some cases. Of course, there are general nonsense constructions of connecting maps for fibrations in terms of the maps one already has in hand, but I want to know: Is there an "intrinsic" model for $P$, one which doesn't rely on the $E$ and $H$ maps in its definition? I would also be interested in an intrinsic model for the map on homotopy, say in terms of framed bordism. 

By Pontryagin's Theorem, you are asking for the preimages of any chosen points in each wedge factor of $S^p \vee S^q \vee S^r$ for the iterated Whitehead product map $p : S^{p+q+r-2} \to S^p \vee S^q \vee S^r$. This can be obtained by chasing through the factorization of this map as $$ S^{p+q+r-2} \to S^{p+q-1} \vee S^r \to S^p \vee S^q \vee S^r.$$ Let's call the three points we want to take preimage of $0_p$, $0_q$ and $0_r$. Then as John said, in the standard model for this product map the preimage of $0_p$ in $S^{p+q-1}$ is a copy of $S^{q-1}$, which we can view as $0 \times S^{q-1} \subset \partial(D^p \times D^q) \subset D^p \times D^q$. Then the preimage of $0_p$ in $S^{p+q+r-2}$ will be the preimage of this $S^{q-1} \subset S^{p+q+1} \vee S^r$, which will be homeomorphic to $S^{q-1} \times S^{r-1}$. Note that this isn't what John anticipated; if he is looking for a (framed) $S^{q+r-2}$, then my answer falls short of that, and in fact I'm not sure if there whether or not there is a model for the Whitehead product where this preimage is spherical. Note as well that I haven't given an embedding of this in $S^{p+q+r-2}$, but that is "straightforward" once one identifies $S^{p+q+r-2}$ as a codimension one subspace of $\partial(D^p \times D^q \times D^r)$. (That is, I'm being lazy.) Similarly, the preimage of $0_q$ is a copy of $S^{p-1} \times S^{r-1}$. Finally, the preimage of $0_r$ requires just one step and is a $S^{p+q-2}$. Again, embeddings can be "explicitly" worked out, though one runs into repeated use of the homeomorphism $\partial(D^n \times D^m) \cong S^{n+m-1}$, which clouds things a bit. The reason I've thought of this is the following question: in what sense are these $S^{p-1} \times S^{r-1}$, $S^{q-1} \times S^{r-1}$ and $S^{p+q+r-2}$ linked, and in particular what topological invariants are there of this linking? Here's an answer: Call these three sub manifolds $K, M$ and $N$. Because they are disjoint and disjoint from $\infty \in S^{p+q+r-2}$, taking one point on each defines a map $K \times M \times N \to {\rm Conf}_3({\mathbb R}^{p+q+r-2})$. Taking the image of the fundamental class defines a homology class in the configuration space, which in this example is non-trivial, and in general is a complete framed cobordism invariant. Choosing some cohomology class to evaluate on this gives a numerical linking invariant, and one such would "count over crossings" of $K$ over $L$ over $M$, etc. This is all worked out in my paper with Ben Walter on Hopf invariants, where we show that such linking invariants "with correction terms" faithfully measure all rational homotopy groups of simply connected spaces. 

You're going to get many different answers depending on the tastes of the topologist answering... I like to think about homotopy groups of spheres through framed cobordism. Theories like unoriented and complex cobordism are understandable for a couple reasons. Technically they are calculable because we can understand their cohomology so well over the Steenrod algebra. But morally they are understandable because they are amenable to analysis through characteristic classes. But for framed bordism, the structure group is the trivial group. So either the theory is going to be trivial, or really hard because there are no characteristic classes to use. It turns out that it is the latter. 

The best work I know of along these lines was by Rossi, a student of Cattaneo, which is explained here: $URL$ There are a number of interrelated views of Vassiliev theory. One approach proceeds from Chern-Simons theory and produces "configuration space integrals" which generalize the Gauss integral that Sammy mentions. (By the way, these for example do generalize to linked S^n's in S^{2n+1}). These integrals were first studied by Bar-Natan in his PhD thesis and then by Bott-Taubes, Kontsevich, D. Thurston, Cattaneo and his collaborators, Volic and others. In topological terms, one takes a knot, looks at the "induced map on configuration spaces" and then uses that map in de Rham theory (including some difficult vanishing arguments) to produce knot invariants. The theory is yet to be completely understood even in dimension three, so as one might expect Cattaneo and Rossi only get a few kinds of configuration space integrals to work out in higher dimensions, but it is a significant starting point.
