Maybe the idea of such existing was mixed up with the occation where a monk told the Buddha that he would leave the holly life if he would not tell him whether there is a "Self" or not. In such way confronted the monk got hardly rebuked an asked if the Buddha ever told that he teaches, will teach such. (Link, later?) Going then back to his usual way of teaching dispassion. But of course, to speculate about futher existences, likewise past or present, lies in the sphere of "I-making" (papanca, or craving-verbalisations). Of which my person guesses that the thought such "Enough" statment like in the OP-Question derives from. 

If this view, and it's not easy different, causes you stress, how could it be right view? What should that be humanity? Such is really strong attachment, strong wrong view, especially because it conains "must". Who and why says? And what about ants? What if you are part of them, identify with them? So what if the two trouble each other? Whom to help? No no, that's all far from right view and so, one still is able to make strong wrong things, even kill ones mother or an Arahat is possible, not to speak about precepts: to help and save.... Let's rebeat them: 

The reasons for bad deeds by thoughts, speech and bodily actions are always either not-knowing, desire for pleasure (greed) or desire to avoid pain (aversion). So when ever such is the cause, there is "bad kamma "made", if done in harmful ways. If escaping from pain and gaining pleasure is made based on knowing, such is "good kamma". So in learning and teaching the means of the Eightfold path one could help. Outside of that, there is no real help. In cases where one is incapable for such, just the reducing of touch which causes him/her pain, would be "helpful" if one is able to do so in rightouse ways.

Light, The skill, actually being very mindfull and hold on certain mind states, which are required for an actor, are the same means one would use in the practice of the path to liberation. So best if one starts to become a real actor here and now. One able to set his mind by will1 on every kind of way of thinking. Good to train that, and good to memorize the text. Best try to be a Dhammic actor. There are at times, as far as seen, many monks and nuns public visible, who have been actors before. Start to act like a Noble One. Right here and now. Train it all day and night, everywhere. Becoming an Arahat means to become a real actor, not limited in his freedom of appearing, taking on what ever skillful profile at wish and is therefore regarded as real Star. What character would you like to act? Buy acting is one called great. And the meaning of that goes rightdirect to the main question: Talents/Skills we possess as Humans Not by birth is one a human with inherent skills, but by deeds, by acts, one can be rightly called human. So if not a sillful actor, not much chance to be rightly called on with human skills: 

Sunset_Limited (1) It's good to remember Kisagotami Theri and Pañcasata Patacara: The Soothing of Grief and all the teachings about the cause of suffering: "Beyond Coping: The Buddha's Teachings on Aging, Illness, Death, and Separation" (2) It's good to keep the Uposatha as long as possible. (3) Sure, not that one might get like a piece of cake, but what ever the departed might be able to take as possibility. For their best possible wellbeing in the future, one looks after providing to keep the Dhamma alive. Read more: [Q&A] How can merit be transferred? and [Q&A] Hungry ghosts and food offerings to the dead, [Q&A] Body feels like crying - Death of beloved Practicing metta, possible start with the beloved and then expand it is good. To bring alms food to monks and dedicate it, is good. It's in buddhist countries usual to give sets of house tools, starting from glas, pot, ... to what ever good for a new house hold, dedicate it as present for the departured and give such to monks. It's good to have a small shrine for ones ancestors and other spirits near and to give best aways a share before eating. (one might put the food firt on this place, offer it, and the ask to take it, before eating one self). Reminding that ever new appearing living being around could be ones previous beloved, is a very good present best act, taking them as such and avoid harming best possible. Also a retreat and/or attentive talks with wise monks or nuns are conductive.

And "knowing": who ever meets the Dhamma, meets the Buddha, meeting the Buddha, one meets the Dhamma. How seldom to meet a Buddhas Dhamma! Honor it and make the best of you wealth previouse gained. Buddhas, if attentive reading, always have their previous "Teacher", devoted, vow before them. [Note: This is a gift of Dhamma and not meant for commercial purpose or other low wordily gains by means of trade and exchange.] 

One saying: "Not everything happens for (better 'out of') a reason." would not speak in accordiance with the Dhamma, does not flow in the stream of Dhamma. Since: By touch dhammas are experianced. Every explaining else is not really possible and subject to errors. Suttas have to be readed carefully, with proper attention, seeking release not something to grasp. Otherwise the Dhamma is like a snake grasp on its tail. [Note: This is a gift of Dhamma and not meant for commercial purpose or other low wordily gains by means of trade and exchange.]

Neither the Buddha nor the Sutta quoting the Buddha here, say that an actor is generally, because of the job actor, destinated in lower realms but, again: 

People normaly act "for a reason" but to put it right, phenomenas arise "out of reason", have causes. So by focus just on giving right causes, phenomenas appear likewise, are experianced according the causes given. The highest cause to go beyound being subject to causes, is the fullfilment of the Eightfold path. There is just one unconditioned Dhamma, yet not to be found without giving the right causes. All beyond that, beyond the all, is just philosophy.

It's all around and within oneself possible to prove rebirth, day by day, moment by moment, and the truth of cessation of becoming can be proved as well. Just cut off not-knowing, ignorance, and the wheel is stopped: release. Real-ease. [Note: This is a gift of Dhamma and not meant for commercial purpose or other low wordily gains by means of trade and exchange.] 

That's the cleaning of the Noble Ones. If wihing to see it, know it, arive at Dhamma, the cleaning from defilements is required to see the truth in the jungle of cheatings. For it's impossible to judge the Dhamma with the means of wordily views and with defilements, having a stand like "me, "we", "they"... How best approach "new daily opinions ideas" changing every day? Seeing that meaningless, not lasting even one day, let go of them, knowing that normal humans are not able to find the right way outside of the timesless eightfold path. There are many who, yet not able to conduct virtuose, attached to countless things, no liberation at all gained, think to be smarter then the Awakened One. Let them... orjoin if finding worthy refuge and real benefit from it. Aging, sickness death and those few going beyond will last nevertheless. Kauva Ātman: if searching for Brahmanic or Mohayaniv approches, this modified ideas you could also find here for example: [English] Sarvastivada School of Realism, by Venerable Vira Avalokita. Imortand again: this are secular approches, defusing the Dhamma of the Buddha and certain counterfies of the well expounded sublime Dhamma. [Note: This is a gift of Dhamma and not meant for commercial purpose or other low wordily gains by means of trade and exchange.] 

So best to gain and put effort into gain of right view, so that such question does not arisen right effort! Again and again and focus proper, yoniso manasikhara, on arise and decay to get disenchanted and gain release. Worthy to note: even one dwells heedful but having not gained right view yet, one is still an outsider. But even one dwelks heedless (not doing Jhana) but having alreadygained right view, is called an insider (Noble One). That is why a teacher of right view, ne possessing right view (e.g. a Noble One), is regarded higher as a teacher of Jhana. So if avaliable, don't seek for "meditation" teacher (because it brings pleasure) but for right view teacher, which can be of cause painful, according to your character and past. Being able to travel, possessing such skill, does not lead to release, goes not beyond the Cosmos. 

Yes, in regard of real help, if posdible, not easy to understand it as such. Worthy to note: If still aspecting your self to be helped, itjs you duty to help. Only if one does no more aspect to be helped, one is rightous free of helping others. And of course, aside helping onself first to get ride of desire, aversion and delution, one who helps others at the same time is more sublime. Yet such is not a inherent duty of the path but of course a duty to be able to reach the path. That is why having helped those who one owes service is one of the highest blessings.

Buddhism has no view, but in regard of the Buddha and to possible explain Dhamma, money laundering is usually part of an undertaking of thieving, e.g. taking of what is not given. As how far is one direct, indirect knowingly, indirect unknowingly... adapting an unskillful action (causes eighter birth in an animal womb, as hungy ghost, leads to hell or, if getting human existence, poorness), that is a case by case question. Taking what is not given is unskilfull, incl. the 1001 ways, in also lying, cheating, betray... As for "combating", it's worthy to read: Wisdom over Justice and Justice vs. Skillfulness to get the Blessed Ones understanding and objectives best possible understood. The Buddha teaches cause and effects and should be not understood as a judge for certain wordly objectives. Best, and if even that much possible, is to combating bad things within one self first. If taking for example the Buddhas teaching to justify of what is not the Dhammas purpose: Such would be like money laundering. (by making Dhamma as impure so that it can be used outside of the religion, e.g. bond) How ever, laundering ones view and action and to encourage to do it likewise is always the best engaging in laundering: No way to clean another ones mind. 

And since this is the way to find out if one is a Noble one or good in its direction, and the Buddha advised not to seek after others for benefit, it's hard to think that he had the view that all discussions are conductive. That in regard of the person. Not to speak about the certain topic. There is a long list of which topics should better not be talked. How ever, mindfulness on the frames of references is required to do not judge wrong and discriminate probably on preoccupations. So when one is not aware of ones feelings and ones mind state, one would easy and fast become either one who avoidsconductive discussions or gets aversive if involving. It's then like the OP question here, one mixes up a little bit of this and that, what ever seens tasty for the defilements, e.g. supportive to identify oneself with it. [Note: This is a gift of Dhamma and not meant for commercial purpose or other low wordily gains by means of trade and exchange.] 

Ilya: "" That part seems to be very far and based on own ideas. My person does not think that such as "always worth undertaking the discussion" would be supportable by dhammic ways of seeing right. See also the Sutta linked, which opposes that right away. How ever, for one who is attentive, not for one who is inattentive; for one who is discerning, not for one who is not discerning: 

Nidanakatha - Introductory story, to the Jatakas may give some "answers", yet not sure if such as "the first Buddha ever" was ever mentioned by the Buddha. Better to reflect the Dhamma of all Buddhasn 

(A possible pitfall for defilement. Take care that they do not rebell and cick you instead of them into it.) Supposed someone asks you something. Given that you have the feeling to know for sure, you answer. The one asked receives it with joy, keeps it, carries it and might share it further. Later you find out that you have been wrong. What now? What's the impact on yours? What should you do now? What are the consequences of the previous deed and eventuall consequences of your current deeds, now when you found out? What to do to rest possible most at ease and secure, at the time of answer and at times things might be grow different, more clear? Not to speak of what to do in cases when answered without being really sure or a bad mind state (with greed, aversion or not-knowing connected). 

Dhammika all over the world, those who have found certain faith, reflect daily by recitation the sublimness of the holly Dhamma. 

Something that counts for everyone with ever kind of livelihood. So if one is eager to move more worse and encourages other as well, that is the reason for hell. And if a person even holds the view that such leads to heaven, then even more worse. It's just that it is tge nature of common acting an show business, that such might be often the case. There are plenty actors who actually work against passion, aversion and delusion. If in this view an ice-cream seller is crazy ofter ice and makes the mass crazy in seeking for consuming it, if he holds the view that passion after ice-cream leads to heaven, then hi case is the same of that of this actor here. Many ways of offensive advertising on illusion, look on advertisement generally, are fully in the frame of being destinated to hell. It would be totally against the Dhamma and the Buddhas approaches to say biased an preoccupied that this or that job lead, because of this or that job, to hell. So Suttas should be carefully readed and Kamma be understood. Otherwise bias and grave A-Dhamma is naturally. So one telling people with delusion and views: "Yes, actors are destinated to hell. Yes, that is wrong livelihood!" in general, increasing others bias with his bias, such a person is in this way destinated to hell. Why? He does actually not know, not understand, listens to his teacher and soon may cry, for having been cheated in that way. Actually teaching without knowing is much more dangerous as acting, since most people would at least do not take acting serious, but if one appears "acting" as a teacher, such is much more serious!
