In an answer to another question ($URL$ I mentioned Galileo as an example of religion contradicting science. Several comments criticised that. I posted another question elsewhere ($URL$ if Galileo's heliocentric arguments were scientifically flawed. Here I hope it can be clarified whether his trial counts as an example of the conflict between science and religion. If that sounds too vague: With conflict between science and religion I mean cases where religion claims the authority to censor and suppress science, or at least, even if it acts benevolently to science most of the time, it demands some sort of veto right and reserves the last word on the subject for itself. I hope the question is still on topic here; otherwise I'd be fine with it being moved. 

I guess what makes a conversation interesting is similar to what makes a school lesson interesting. Either you already care about the subject, or the teacher is "entertaining". If we examine the meaning of "entertaining" closer, I'd suggest it means that the teacher manages to get our emotions involved, by being either funny or dramatic. With a teacher like that, learning becomes like a game or an adventure: We feel a challenge that we do not want to ignore, satisfying triumph if we master the challenge, and amusement (benevolent or malevolent) if others fail at challenges by overlooking something we easily spotted. If we already care about a subject, we can be gripped even a "boring" teacher, because we are already emotionally invested; we already have accepted challenges and want to prove ourselves. With conversations it's pretty much the same thing, I would say. However, as you mention, in that context another factor comes into play: The person we are talking to. As Ant already pointed out in his answer, while firting people enjoy a conversation even when it has no intellectual interest. In that case, the evaluation of the conversation is based on different emotions, i.e. the birds and the bees. ;) 

I have to say, as an atheist I am a bit suprised by the notion that life without god might be not worth living. That sounds more like something an addict might say about life without his drug. But religion is not supposed to be a drug. (Or is it? Then who would be the pushers?) However, obviously the problem is very real for you, and I guess also for a lot of other people. So I'll try to provide an answer. You are asking if there can be a meaning of life without god. To find an answer, the first step I'd recommend is to consider the definition of the question. What do people usually mean when they speak of the "meaning of life"? I see two common concepts: A) The meaning of life is a secret task given to you before your birth. You'll have to figure it out yourself, but hopefully when you die someone who's supernaturally wise will pat you on the back and say: "Well done, son! You did the right thing! You gave your all and achieved all we hoped you would manage, and more." Obviously, atheism cannot promise a similar secret destiny overseen by supernatural forces. However, I think the most important reason why that concept is so appealing is that you work for a purpose greater than yourself. And that is still totally possible without god. There are lots of worthwhile projects which contribute to a better society and a better future for mankind. You could also try to make a difference on a local level and get more involved in your community. Or you could try to contribute to the progress of science, or to an open-source software project. Or, the most obvious: Raise a family. :) The possibilities are endless. Remember, it is a common misconception that by rejecting god atheists also reject ethics and become egoists who are only interested in their own pleasure. However, if you always dreamt of giving non-stop partying a try, no one's stopping you. ;) B) The second concept: The meaning of life is just something that provides you with enduring happiness and satisfaction. I guess most people discover after a while that pure pleasure-seeking and partying cannot achieve that. What do they try instead? I already mentioned raising a family, or getting involved in a humanitarian or idealistic cause. Others choose a life of ambition and competition, whether in sports, politics, business or whatever. That's probably not so idealistic, but nobody expects atheists to be saints anyway. ;) I assume that religion was not the only source of happiness in your life so far. Just focus on the other things that inspired and impressed you, and build upon that. Nevertheless, a possible problem for someone in your situation might be that losing religion not only left you without directions, but also charged your happiness with a straight handicap. That might take one of the following forms: 1) A feeling of guilt. A christian education often emphasizes that you should feel guilty if you do not believe in god strongly enough. Paradoxically, not believing in god at all would than result in an even stronger feeling of guilt. Despite the obvious logical contradiction, it's quite possible that your emotions cannot adjust so easily. That needs time and patience. In that case, I'd recommend focussing on the fact that you have a clean conscience, since your conscience now is only about what you do to other humans. God can take care of himself. 2) Loss of community. If being part of a church made you part of a lively community, it's obviously tough to lose that. Even worse would be if your friends and relatives are shocked and suspicious about the sudden appearance of an atheist in their midst. Hopefully, with time and patience they'll learn to deal with that. Otherwise maybe you'll have to move on. Lots of people have managed to start a new life. 3) Missing prayer. I suppose that prayer, if done the right way, can have a very positive effect on one's emotions. Atheists must get along without that. But they can find adequate replacements. You might try meditation, or seek the feeling of inspiration and awe that can be found within music, arts or scenic nature. 4) Fear of death. If one does not believe in a life after death, doesn't that make the thought of death to terrible to bear? From my experience, not at all. Of course almost everyone is scared in a life-threatening situation. But in that case you'd be high on adrenaline and probably occupied with other things than the philosophy of the afterlife. In quiter situations, it's trite but effective to remember that as long as you can worry about death your worries have not yet come to pass. :) I suppose the actual experience of death is probably not very different from fainting or losing consciousness in an accident. People manage to deal with that all the time. And even if you don't manage so well: It probably takes only a few seconds, and nobody will criticise you afterwards. ;) I guess what could actually cause panic in the face of death is the thought that you have important unfinished business, or missed to do all the things you still wanted to do, or have not done anything with your life yet. But that's probably nothing else than the feeling of not having found the meaning of life, so that discovering a way of life that feels meaningful will protect you from that panic. If you work on a business that you actually and deeply consider important, then I'm pretty sure that even if death interrupts you before you can finish it, you will feel satisfied that working on it was reward enough. 

Abstract: Zarathustra addresses a ‘little old woman’. Everything about women, he tells her, has pregnancy as a solution. A man should be brought up for war and the woman for the recreation of the warrior. The woman’s task is to bring out the child in the man. The happiness of a man is ‘I will’, of a woman ‘he wills’. Her world becomes ‘perfect’ when she obeys out of total love. The old woman replies with‘a little truth’: ‘You are going to women? Then don’t forget the whip’. It seems to be quite irrelevant that it is put in the mouth of the old woman – this is merely a rhetorical device designed to intensify the force of Zarathustra–Nietzsche’s views on women: ‘You see, even old, that is, wise, women agree with me’, he implies. Nietzsche's biography might be brought to bear on his views on women. He was raised in a family of women of rigidly moralistic views. His marriage proposals were all rebuffed; and the women whom he seemed most to admire, Lou Salomé and Cosima Wagner, were strong-willed individuals who did not especially subscribe to conventional roles for women. No doubt, Nietzsche had many motivations for complicated reactions to "woman as such.” Though the formal point of this passage is to advise the potential free spirit on how to comport himself with women, its main value is as a manifestation of how deeply the Lou Salomé affair had damaged Nietzsche’s attitude to women. There is a very marked contrast between Nietzsche’s empathetic stance towards the plight of women in nineteenth-century Europe in the pre-Lou period and this raising of male chauvinism to the point, even by nineteenth-century standards, of caricature, this insulting slapping down of everything Lou aspired to. It is not hard to see what has happened. In the aftermath of the affair, Nietzsche eased his pain by taking a kind of fictional revenge. The passage, in other words, is cut from the same cloth as the pathologically disturbed letters he wrote to Rée and Lou Salomé at precisely the same time as he was writing Part I of Zarathustra. It is, as he himself says of those letters, incompatible with the rejection of ‘resentment’ by his innermost mode of thinking. Nietzsche might also be seen as sexist's divided attitude because he personifies Life and Wisdom as women in Zarathustra posing Zarathustra as the lover of both. To be set against Zarathustra awful remarks about women in Part I, however, is the fact that in its two ‘dance-songs,’ one in Part II and the other in Part III, ‘Life’ (whom Zarathustra claims to love unreservedly) is portrayed as a woman, ‘wild and not virtuous’( Zarathustra II §10) who dances in an ecstatic circle with ‘flaming, flying hair’( Zarathustra III §15, in part, surely, a portrait of the heroine of Nietzsche’s favourite opera, Carmen). One can analyse this divided attitude to women in terms of Nietzsche’s own categories of the ‘Dionysian’ and the ‘Apollonian’. Women attract Nietzsche because the erotic represents transcendence of suffering individuality, à la Tristan und Isolde, the ‘intoxicated’ absorption into a ‘higher community’, Dionysian, as described in The Birth of Tragedy. Burnt by the Lou affair, however, he reacts with the exaggerated Apollonianism represented by The Birth of Tragedy as the Doric response to the harmful side of Dionysianism: Apollo’s ‘majestic rejection of all licence’ (Birth of Tragedy §2) So dangerous are women that they must be pressed back into the cage of nineteenth-century Apollonian's chauvinism. By Part III of Zarathustra, written towards the end of 1883 as he was beginning to recover a certain, at least temporary, equilibrium after the Lou affair, Nietzsche’s text has calmed down somewhat, and even performs a kind of penance for the whip remark. In The Other Dance-Song ( Zarathustra III §15) Zarathustra tries to make Life dance to his tempo by cracking his whip – as seemingly advised to do in Part I. Life asks him to stop. Surely he knows that ‘noise murders thoughts’, in particular the ‘tender’ thoughts she is beginning to have about him. Even in Part III, however, Nietzsche remains opposed to female emancipation: ‘women are becoming mannish,’ he claims, because there is so little ‘manfulness’ in men – only a properly mannish man will ‘redeem the woman in women’(Zarathustra III §5). Nietzsche's sexism's divided attitude is a complex topic. In some of his writings he mouths the inflammatory misogynistic imagery of Schopenhauer's "On Women," arguably the most notorious denunciation of women in German. For Nietzsche's repetition of Schopenhauerian images (see, for example, Beyond Good and Evil, §232-39). At other times, he presents psychological brief descriptions depicting interactions among women and men; frequently in these, he seems to be sympathetic to women.(This is particularly evident in, for example, Gay Science, §71, which concludes, "In sum, one cannot be too kind about women."). He frequently personifies abstract ideas in female form, and he appeals to stereotypical images of women, although in the latter cases he often plays with the images or refers explicitly to male perceptions of women. Presumably, his preface remark in Beyond Good and Evil, "Supposing truth is a woman - what then?" has been interpreted as sexist because it utilizes stereotypical images of women. An example of Nietzsche's explicit discussion of male fantasy occurs in Gay Science, §59. 

I like shane's example of being cheated out of a heritage without knowing it, and the argument that even personally not feeling a victim of discrimination might just mean you're "brainwashed". However, I think hinted at in the original question is a related question: What if the victims of discrimination were actually happier that way? Shouldn't the decision be made for them, for their own good? To return to the heritage example, what if I would be actually happier remaining poor, continuing my simple, uncomplicated way of life with my friends and my family, instead of living in a gilded cage with hedonistic luxuries, surrounded by shallow pleasure-seekers and cold-hearted capitalists who believe that money can buy you happiness? What if women were actually happier in their traditional role of housewife and mother? What if black people were actually happier working as slaves on the plantations? (I think that claim was actually made without blushing by some whites in the southern states before the American civil war.) One could argue, if the apparent victims are actually content with the way they are treated, why not offer them a choice nevertheless? No one forces them to quit their traditional way of life. But maybe already being given the choice is forcing them in a subtle way, maybe they will be manipulated by propaganda. And just the fact of having to face a difficult decision is making your life more stressful, complicated and unpleasant. All this boils down to someone else making a decision for me, because he thinks that I will not be able to recognize what is best for me. To defend that as ethical, I guess he would have to give good reasons that he is actually better informed than me, is not biassed and does not profit from the decision. In the cases of discrimination discussed here that is hardly the case. (Men profit from discriminating women, and of course slave-owners profit from slavery.) And even if it were, we end up with the classical problem of the benevolent dictator: A dictator might be able to work for the common good much more efficiently than a democracy, if he really were benevolent. But what about his successor? Will his successor still be benevolent? Once you have given up rights, you cannot just ask them back. 

What would being a serious alternative to the scientific method imply? To be useful, it would need to make precise and observable predictions about the material world. However, if you make predictions like that, common sense implies that it CAN be observed if the predictions actually come true, and that it SHOULD be observed, at least to check whether you fooled yourself or not. But with that, you pretty much have the basic idea of the scientific method. Sure you could question if a prediction needs to be observable and precise to be useful. If I understand Cort Ammon's answer correctly, that's what he suggests about traditional Chinese medicine. He makes the valid point that predictions concerning human beings can hardly be precise, and that's certainly a huge handicap for sociology, psychology and medicine. But any form of medicine that claims to be useful implicitly makes the prediction that it is able to help the majority of patients. Is that a precise prediction? (With precise I mean that is possible to check objectively if a prediction came true.) Probably not, because it is also very hard to predict precisely how the illness would have progressed without interference. And if the patient feels somewhat better that might only be a result of the placebo effect. You might be inclined to trust in a controversial theory like acupuncture (or homeopathy), but intellectual honesty would demand that you at least consider the possibility of being wrong. Even if acupuncture were all right in principle, the therapist you choose might not know what he's doing, or even be a devious fraud. Moreover, maybe only a part of a traditional form of medicine might be "the real thing", the other part might still be the result of superstition and wishful thinking. How can you distinguish between those? If the criterium of "somehow feeling satisfied" after an intervention that promises benevolent yet inprecise consequences is not enough to evaluate a non-scientific claim, what is? I see three possible answers. (They also apply to magical rituals and similar stuff.) a) You blindly trust in tradition and authority. History of mankind tells us that might not always be a good idea - not in politics, and not in science. b) You trust what feels emotionally most appealing to you. That is not exacly a promising strategy to avoid wishful thinking. c) You apply philosophical or poetical criteria. Sadly, history has shown that this can be quite misleading. For example the ancient greek astronomers were convinced that the planets moved in circles because they considered circles to be the most perfect shapes in geometry. But modern observation has discovered that nature dared to choose a less beautiful shape: ellipses. The amazing thing about science is that it provides an objective way to check its own claims. You suspect that a scientist is a fool who is telling bullshit? You don't have to trust his authority, you can go and check for yourself if he is telling the truth. (Admittedly, you better not bother trying to repeat elaborate experiments like the LHC in your garage.) In logic and mathematics claims can be checked objectively as well. But they do not provide direct knowledge about the material world. (For example, with mathematics alone you cannot decide if Euclidian or non-Euclidian geometry is the correct description of the universe, although both are "true" in a mathematical sense, i.e. logically developed out of different sets of basic assumptions.) To conclude, I cannot see an alternative to the scientific method that has the same ability to filter out incorrect or misleading descriptions of the physical reality. 

According to the deflationary theory of truth, characterizing a sentence as true adds nothing new to its content,the adjective ‘true’ is redundant and is not a real predicate expressing a real property. In physics there is no evidence available in principle that can distinguish a theory’s truth from its utility and reliability in prediction. In mathematics truth is what was proved from axioms. Can truth be stated justifiably, without first having theory of truth ascriptions? Is there a provability-independent way to reconstruct phrases like "the truth really there"? My answer: No. 

Someone might argue that if there is no empirical evidence to appeal to in order to establish whether brains in a computer model of the world that can simulate human conscience, then the hypothesis is metaphysical. Many philosophers would maintain that such metaphysical possibilities do not amount to pragmatic cases of doubt: At present, it is physically impossible to make a computer model of the world that can simulate human cognition and replicate the qualitative phenomenology of a human conscience. The hard problem of consciousness is why or how does some particular brain process produce that particular taste or visual sensation? It is difficult to see any real explanatory connection between specific conscious states and brain states in a way that explains just how or why the former are identical with the latter. There is therefore an explanatory gap between the physical and mental. This difficulty in explaining consciousness is unique; that is, we do not have similar worries about other scientific identities, such as that “water is H2O” or that “heat is mean molecular kinetic energy.” There is an important sense in which we can’t really understand how physicalism could be true. The existence of a "hard problem" is controversial and has been disputed by some philosophers. For philosophers who assert that consciousness is nonphysical in nature, there remains a question about what outside of physical theory is required to explain consciousness. Consciousness is especially resistant to explanation in physical terms because of the inherent differences between our subjective and objective modes of understanding. But why we must be deluded by schizophrenic and LSD hallucinations to empathetically take on an experiential perspective understanding? Is subjective understanding necessary to make objective science? Some physicists, argue that an interpretation is nothing more than a formal equivalence between sets of rules for operating on experimental data, thereby implying that the whole exercise of interpretation is unnecessary, for example in quantum physics. Any modern physic's scientific theory requires at the very least an instrumentalist description that relates the mathematical formalism to experimental practice and prediction. 

Short Explanation: It looks like instrumentalism. Instrumentalism avoids the debate between anti-realism and philosophical or scientific realism. It may be better characterized as non-realism. Instrumentalism shifts the basis of evaluation away from whether or not phenomena observed actually exist, and towards an analysis of whether the results and evaluation fit with observed phenomena. By abuse of language, a bare instrumentalist description could be referred to as an interpretation, although this usage is somewhat misleading since instrumentalism explicitly avoids any explanatory role; that is, it does not attempt to answer the question why.
