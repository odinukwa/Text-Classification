The morale of my story is, if using a compass for navigation in unknown waters, obtain the charts and Coast Pilot for the area and review them in advance. 

Based on the comments, it seems that you are looking for some sort of fabric that has moisture wicking capabilities. There are several fabrics that have this desirable trait. Many of them are synthetic blends, and modern chemical engineering is constantly improving the state-of-the-art in moisture wicking fabric. As to the other part of your question, the answer is definitely yes. You can get practically any garment- underwear, socks, hats, shirts, pants, shirts, jackets, ... - made using one of these fabrics. The price points are typically higher than standard fabrics, but some are reasonable as well. From here, I'll leave it to you to shop for exactly what you want. EDIT: As an after-thought, note that there is a difference between absorbing and wicking. A fabric that absorbs pulls sweat into itself, and holds it. A fabric that wicks pulls sweat through itself, from wetter areas to drier areas. Absorbing is usually bad- it leaves you feeling wet and sticky. In cold times, that wetness degrades any insulating properties of the fabric, and it hot times it slows evaporation, negating your body's natural attempt to cool itself through sweating. Wicking is preferred, as it moves the sweat away from the body and allows it to evaporate on the outer surface. 

So we see that the tube can be used to deflate the PFD, and allow it to be put back in its flat and folded configuration. Pages 11 to 13 show us how to re-pack the PFD. Note that the CO2 cartridges are one-time. Once the nozzle is punctured, the cartridge will release all of its pressure. Likewise, the trigger mechanism is broken in the act of pulling the cord, and if you have an automatic one, there is a tablet that will dissolve in water releasing the spring-loaded trigger, and thus need replacing. Most brands sell re-arming kits, and some dealers will do the re-arming for a nominal fee. Instructions are on pages 8 through 10 of the manual. Finally, I think the strongest evidence that these things are designed for re-use, is the simple fact that all manufactures recommended annually testing them. Starting on page 16: 

If you imagine cutting a canoe or kayak along each axial plane, you get three shapes. If you cut along the waterline and look down from above, you get the plan. Cut thwart-wise at the widest point and view from head-on, that's the cross-section. The cross-section may or may not include tumblehome, a narrowing of the sides toward the gunwales. Finally, cut lengthwise and view from the side, that's the rocker. Designers have a variety of shapes to choose from for each of these, as the sketches below illustrate. 

My question is how the various choices in plan, cross, and rocker translate into improvements or sacrifices in stability, speed, maneuverability, and tracking. I already have some broad intuitive notions, as well as a sense that what improves one of these traits generally degrades another. I am wondering if someone can help with the gritty details, possibly even get into the physics and mathematics of it (i.e. give us a primer on fluid dynamics as it relates to paddle sports.) Just as an example, I have a kayak with a flat rocker, mid-range plan, and gently rounded cross-section with tumblehome. This kayak is very stable, has good tracking, is reasonably maneuverable, although it is not fast. If it were narrower, my guess is it would be faster but less stable. If the cross-section was more round, it would be more maneuverable but at the expense of its good tracking. Are these ideas correct? Why exactly? 

I currently live about 25 miles northeast of Cincinnati, Ohio, USA. On February 20-21, 2015, a fairly significant snow and ice event struck the area. On February 29-March 1, 2016, a smaller event occurred also bringing a thin coating of ice. From February 20-24, 2017, it is sunny and 60°F (16°C) or higher. I mention this just to illustrate how unusual the weather has been at this time of year, during 2017. My workplace overlooks a pond. In past summers, I have gone so far as to break out binocs and a guide book, and identified that we have at least one map turtle, five painted turtles, and maybe a red-eared slider. Today (Feb 24, 2017) I went outside for a break and saw the map turtle and two of the painteds on one of the logs on the edge of the pond. Considering that the long-term forecast does not preclude a return to more normal conditions (there is a blizzard not 200 miles away right now), is there any chance that this early emergence from their hibernacula could ultimately be harmful to these guys? Or could they just as easily return to the pond bottom and resume a state of brumation for another month or two? 

I didn't intend to self-answer, but after hours of 'net searching I seem to have stumbled on the answer, provided by an Olympic Gold Medalist sailor from Australia, so I hope we can trust it. You can read the full article at Australia Sailing yourself, I will just summarize it. When on a beat and the winds are gaining in intensity, this will have the effect of adding power to your sails, which adds speed. At the same time, the higher winds will increase the heel of your boat, which takes speed away and makes the helm unbalanced. When the heel exceeds a few degrees, the net effect is negative, and you need to de-power your sails. You can do this by either pinching in, meaning to sail closer to the direction of the wind, or by flattening sails, reducing their horizontal curvature. There are a few ways to do this, including adding tension to the backstay, putting the traveler all the way out, increasing down-haul, and- as the linked question and answer describe- wetting the sails. 

One thing not yet mentioned is quickness and ease of rescue. In my younger years, I was a trained lifeguard, and though my certification is long expired, I remember most of the concepts. A struggling swimmer on the surface is one thing, but a swimmer that has been witnessed going down, or worse, reported missing by a companion, is quite another. For such a situation, in water up to 10 or 12 ft. (3 or 4m), the lifeguards have a chance of doing something. They line up near the last known position, dive down, look and feel along the bottom as long as possible, come up for a breath or two, and repeat until the victim is found or until exhaustion. Beyond that depth, even the most fit have trouble remaining down as long, or even being able to get all the way down, and reach exhaustion much quicker. At one lake where I worked, there was a buoy line. We never took any disciplinary action if anyone went beyond the line, but it was also clearly marked on signs that the lifeguards would not attempt rescue beyond that point. All we were even allowed to do, per our employer's rules, was call 911. Odds are the county would have sent out a dive team, and it would have been mostly a recovery operation, not a rescue. 

This answer applies only to signal mirrors which are two-sided and have an aiming hole in the middle, which should be the case with any good signal mirror. My answer will partially duplicate a prior, but will add some rough pictures and also give a description of the geometry behind how it works. The process Stand facing roughly half-way between the sun and the object you want to signal. Hold the mirror up and observe your own reflection in the back of the mirror. Move the mirror around until you see the shadow of the mirror on your reflection, and in particular note the little dot of light on your cheek due to the aiming hole. 

My answer is that as soon as a thing begins being thought of, even potentially, as being involved in a sailing craft, it takes on the sailing term. If I am going to the hardware store to buy something to make a leash for my dog, or to hang stuff up in my shed, that's rope. If I am going to buy the same exact thing to become a traveler or a painter, that's line. The same can be said of a toilet becoming a head, or a piece of wood being a floor/deck or a wall/ bulkhead, or a mattress being for a bed or a berth. 

Eventually some part of your brain is going to start thinking, "Holy (expletive), Rattlesnake! I'm gonna loose an extremity! I'm gonna die! What's going to happen to my family? Why did I even come on this (expletive) trip? OhGodOhGodOhGodOh...." Then another part of your brain is going to tell the first part to stop thinking like that, it is not constructive. Then the first part is going to reply back, "Up yours!" and go on thinking those thoughts. The more you try to tell yourself not to think about something, the more you are going to think about it. Ever have a musical ear-worm? The trick is to not try to tell yourself not to think about the bad things, but instead tell yourself to think about something else. Tell yourself to think about what you need to do now to get proper care and treatment. Tell yourself to think about what you will do to celebrate your recovery. Tell yourself to think about something mundane, like your job or your favorite TV show or that hobby project you've got going. Don't try to force out the panicky thoughts, just allow the other thoughts to replace them. If all else fails, use breathing. Inhale. Exhale. Inhale. Exhale. Feeling calmer yet? Works every time.
