I am an employee of a large defense industry company and am on a contract to provide IT services to a large government defense agency. I've been a contractor now for 18 years in various companies. All of the companies I've worked for fit what I'm going to say below, to a T. Note that I've never worked in a pure civilian-side position (non-defense, non-government) in any of my last 30 years of employment. All of that aside, I can only speak for my division of my company and the requirements we get from our government customer. There is only one no heck requirement: Security+ or an equivalent from a short list of certifications. That's it. As far as education goes, every single IT job (not counting upper management, of course, which aren't IT as much as management) requires a Bachelor's Degree (of some kind) or anywhere from 5-9 years experience. Recognize that no where in that last paragraph did I say anything about where the degree is/was from. 

The contract you have between you and your employer, assuming it is a valid one, usually trumps other things, such as vocally-communicated policy changes. Even written changes can be "over-ruled" by your contract, as long as they are coming from personnel who aren't in a position to make them. (By this I mean that if you are in a section of a branch of a division, and your first line supervisor says that your notice period has changed, it is unlikely he has the authority to 'speak for the company' as it were.) As it happens, however, your contract, according to you, also contains the clause that you are "obliged to obey the rules and regulations (as) amended from time to time." A large company will set policies and guidance and have those written changes communicated to its employees by HR, just as yours has done. Assuming those changes that HR has emailed everyone about have actually been incorporated into things like the company regulations and/or employee's handbooks, then you have been officially notified of the "amendments" to the notice period, and are now obliged to follow them. This is my belief as a employee of large and small companies for over 30 years. I am not a lawyer and if you think you have need to "fight" this change, I would highly recommend you seek out professional legal assistance, which is the only way you will really be sure. 

There is always something to do. It's a perfect time to take some time off, whether it be a week's vacation, or simply a day to perform all those little home tasks you've been putting off. It's a perfect opportunity to ensure you've completed all of the annual company training required, if any. Attend a free webinar offered by your software vendor. Study up on the hardware you're going to be coding for. Even it it is hardware being actually made by the team, there should be components that you can learn about. You're a coder, pick a part of the language you use that you aren't comfortable coding, and learn more about it. Practice. Write up code snippets that you might be able to use. Think like you have been given the go ahead... what might you need to go out to Google to look up how to do. Look it up now and learn it, and write snippets. Even if it ends up not being needed, you've now got it in your personal portfolio. When you do get the go ahead, you're likely going to be pushed to perform fast, since the other team caused delays (their inefficiency isn't your problem, until your boss makes it so.) Try to figure out everything you can, now, to prep for your own work when it comes. Keep busy, keep happy, make it look like you're productive. Otherwise your company may start wondering why they've got you around now, before you're needed. 

I would think about sending a polite email to everyone, except the boss, and be upfront. Don't mention the law or any of that, just spell out that when they smoke in front of the entrance with the door cracked, it stinks up your office and makes it difficult to concentrate on your own work. Ask them to please always smoke as if the boss were there, even when she isn't. Start out with the non-threatening and polite request and see what happens. I would not go to the boss first thing. I don't think anything that disrupts your own ability to work is something to avoid, after all, if you are unable to perform your job to your fullest ability, you are depriving your company of whatever it is you do, AND it could, in the final tally, cost your job. I still wouldn't go 'snitch' to the boss, first thing. It's your issue, and their cause. Take it up with them, first. If you don't get anywhere, then take it to the boss, and let her quote the law. Or you can mention it in passing to your boss (hey, it's hard to concentrate on work when they leave the door open to smoke, did you know their actually supposed to smoke way over there?). Another thing you could recommend, depending on where your office is, is an external phone buzzer on a timer, so that when the office is closed it does not ring. This would alert the smokers that the phone is ringing from a distance. 

If this were me, I would respectfully request a meeting with my supervisor and bring up the start- and end-times as the main topic. During the conversation bring up the fact that the clock you all use is inaccurate, but it is what you use, both for the start and end times of your day. Then I would ask how many hours a day you are expected to work. Let your supervisor tell you his expectations. Finally, ask your supervisor to specify your start and end times. So let's say that he says you are to work 8 hours, with lunch, so 8.5 hours. Your day should be 9 to 5:30. If he states that he expects you to work from 8:45 to 5:45, then you know his expectations. Again, if this were me, I would very respectfully state that since those are your expectations of me, that "those are the hours I will work, however please realize that you are asking me to work an extra half hour per day unpaid." Whether or not you choose to actually work the extra time, unpaid, is, in the end, up to you. You are free to quit, and he is free to fire you. Please also realize that my answer is assuming you actually work all day long and don't spend a significant amount of time on facebook, texting, or surfing the Interwebz... 

I'm currently sitting on the other side of the table, building up a team. Maybe it's not the norm but for me, if you 'talk the talk' as they say, I can get a feeling for whether candidates are good on the job and ultimately I'll form my picture working with a candidate on a trial day, or pair programming session. So, if you genuinely are good at a job, display it not by preening yourself on something but by having an honest conversation, being interested in what problems you would be facing and - if you can - Current producer supplier, on how you would approach those difficulties, regardless of whether you would be hired. Would work with me, at least. 

You get the idea. Every aspect one might feel constrained by could be removed - but it doesn't have to, necessarily. Greenfield projects are designed to provide a lot of freedom, but you best ask the company offering it, what you are and aren't free to do in such a project. Examples: 

I think your best bet is to fuse the two: Find a job at a retailer specializing in health care. Use this second degree to your advantage. There's virtually no combination of two degrees that one can't use to their advantage when you have the right attitude. Transition from one field to the other in a step-by-step manner like this: 

Disability is a lack of certain abilities, just abilities considered ubiquitous. That what I suggest treating it like. 

Any employee can use this excuse, and any employee is expected to inform the company in advance if the appointment is scheduled or to inform the company right away, if it's an unplanned visit. 

Once you go through a recruiter you usually aren't allowed to contact the respective company directly. Conversely, recruiters won't follow through once they realize you're already in contact with the company, because it's costing the company extra money to pay the recruiter, which they won't pay because they already have a relationship with you. Also, taking up the offer of a recruiter is hardly keeping them from introducing more potential candidates, because it increases/activates they pool of candidates and because the more people they introduce the more likely it is that someone will fit the profile and they will get paid. Telling the company that you've also been contacted about this job by a recruiter may be helpful if you wrap it in a hint towards their stated policy of not working with recruiters. It shows that you pay attention to them and that others deem you a fit for the position, too. 

Well, you can wear a shirt and a tie. People crawl around in the dirt wearing a shirt and a tie all the time. A set of strudy white shirts and dry cleaners' fee every now and then don't have to be that expensive. There are stain resistant ties, too (think company colors). Having a couple white shirts and ties in the trunk at all times feels nice, and walking around like that feels even nicer. You should look around for that and give it a try. If that doesn't work out for you, try branded shirts with your department name or logo across the back and basecap style hats with the same logo. Logo on one piece of clothing may be coincidence but having it on two is a clear sign and people who pay the least bit of attention won't get that wrong. That logo has to be distinctly different from the chain's general CI, though, which may or may not be a problem. So, seriously. Give the shirt-and-tie a try. 

Step 3 demands your creativity. Think outside the box, don't go looking for "That One Job" that you want to do in the long run, but see how the things you like about that perspective can be fused with the job experience you already have. These jobs are out there and with an open mind, unblinkered, you will find it. And sooner than you expect. 

Can a company call on ethics to forbid you from participating in this case? I think not. They can forbid you from drawing on outside resources of course. Or shun everything community-backed altogether. But only picking out active contribution is, in my opinion, hypocritical at best, unethical in itself on closer examination. In my opinion, so as long as your company gains something from drawing on stackexchange, in some form or another, it's your company's duty, ethically speaking, to allow, even encourage you to participate, too. Disclaimer: because this keeps coming up I do not suggest disobeying a company's rules and guidelines. I'm only voicing my opinion on them. 

Just go ahead and ask for it. Be polite and state the purpose. For an annual review or similar it is totally legitimate to ask for such letters or mails and I wouldn't expect anybody to see this as selfish. Especially if they know the corporate ladder. Superiors should actually be happy about your request, I would think, as it shows you're invested in the company. EDIT: The pre-supposition is that the work done is actually out of scope of your current assignments and really goes 'above and beyond'. If you're just doing your work for somebody higher up in the food chain, this is what your job is about and you shouldn't expect any gold stars for it. 

Some job agencies work like that. You have to talk to them to figure that out, though. I know a few and the common denominator in my experience is, that they try to get to know you personally over a few meetings, develop a detailed skill profile and have at least some knowledge of your field of profession in their team as well (which helps find better, more interesting opportunities). Good criteria to look for:
