Foucault has clearly moved away from a phenomenological perspective if he now concerns himself with the meaning of a sign or a fact such as madness, and how that sign is defined by cultural and political agendas, rather than possessing an objective definition. Concurrently Foucault addresses the impossibility of an objective definition for such a term that is not intrinsically biased. 

The difference is essentially the same as that which Gottlob Frege discusses in his seminal work On Sense and Reference. Putnam essentially uses the word meaning in place of Frege's sense, presumably because it seemed more intuitive for Putnam to splinter reference from meaning rather than make meaning a redundant term in our language. The distinction between meaning and reference is simple: meaning/sense is the intension or the word, name or symbolic representation of an object; the reference is the thing to which the intension corresponds in the world—the reference is the object to which you are referring, if you will. For instance, if you think of a battery, you have the word battery and you have symbols for batteries, such as: 

Peter Singer is a preference utilitarian as he expounds in his famous book, Practical Ethics. The author of the first document you cited also defines Mr. Singer as a preference utilitarian: 

and yet you also have the battery as a physical object, as an actual battery in the world, an extension. You have that which you mean and your ways of meaning it. The referent and the symbol to refer to it. An interesting parallel between analytic and continental philosophy is Frege's distinction between sense and reference, which is also acknowledged in semiotics as the distinction between signifier and signified. Putnam differs from Frege in where meaning and reference sit. For Frege and others like him, meaning is a social, communicable sign/symbol and reference is in the world. For Putnam, both meaning and reference are in the world, because reference influences the formation of the symbols and names we use for meaning. Putnam sought to prove his argument with his famous Twin Earth thought experiment. 

You state that you doubt so let's begin with "dubito, ergo cogito, ergo sum" -- "I doubt, therefore I think, therefore I exist", by which you can establish that your existence is true. Now you can consider that your perceptions -- forgoing any interpretation by yourself -- are true perceptions (neural stimulii at least). In this way you can build up a contingent reality. It is contingent upon interpretations that you know may be mistaken. Nevertheless you have a kernel of real truth at the centre at least. Further structures of truth/reason in your world depend on how well you trust your reasoning. 

I would recommend the James Legge translation which can be found with notes here:- $URL$ and all on one page without notes here:- $URL$ Also on Sacred Books of The East, vol 39 (sbe39) is The Writings of Chuang Tzu, which in many places elucidates the Tâo Te Ching. There are various editions:- 

(Jacques Derrida, "A Taste for the Secret", page 20) To return to your question on symmetry, a human with free-will should believe in asymmetry. On a higher dimension of time this may be an illusion, and the virtual human environment may indeed be symmetric, but the what is the status of the 'real' higher dimension. Is it symmetric or asymmetric? or does the question no longer apply because of the nature of the higher dimension. Either way, on the human level it would be an illusion to believe in symmetry because then one could not take choices or function at all. 

Also sentiments of Buddhist non-striving (e.g. Cetana sutta). Basically, if you've got your life pattern sorted, ideally it shouldn't make any difference if today is your last day or not. So in a way, these ancient philosophies are in line with "living each day like it was your last". 

A Buddhist Bible, page 49 As for using "intuition to grasp what reality actually is", this is indeed all you have to go on. You can never be sure at which point you may be completely mistaken about something, but you can take a punt. Still it's a shot in the dark and you might be wrong. 

This indicates already that to be any of these things, you need to think for yourself and you need to think in a certain way. Your thinking needs to become structured, not to preclude novel, out of the box approaches to problems but to enable you to understand what you are learning in your own terms, rather than simply memorising somebody else's terms. The Socratic Method is ideal because, as I said, as an instructor you will appeal to your students to think about how to solve a problem and the only way they will arrive at the correct answer is to think like a philosopher, computer scientist or mathematician. The further advantage with the Socratic Method is that you will require your students to justify their answer, so even if they happen on the correct answer or a strong thesis, they have to understand why it is correct or strong in order to be right. Thus when a student gives an incorrect answer, you reply with an explanation of the flaws in their logic and they will have a blueprint for how to improve; when a student answers correctly, they are made aware of the fact that their thinking was correct and that they should refine and apply their way of thinking to future questions. In epistemological terms, you can view the Socratic Method as a way of embedding procedural knowledge in your students, rather than making them memorise propositional knowledge. In computer science terms, you are giving students imperative knowledge rather than declarative knowledge. You are not just feeding them definitions and rules from which they would be lucky to intuit the abstract nature of the subject at hand; you are not even just giving them a recipe or an instruction set leading to the correct answer for them to analyse. You are making the students think about how to formulate such a recipe and inviting them to challenge rules, to play Devil's advocate, all for the purpose of being wrong. Obviously some people possess natural talents, truly intuitive grasps of subjects like mathematics, but the Socratic Method appeals to all students. It refines the students who are already adept and it brings the uninitiated up to speed by forcing them to make mistakes. If we do not grasp something intuitively, we learn by trial and error, and what better way to force trial and error than to ask your students to give answers before being comprehensively shown how to answer? They will make mistakes and they will learn from them. Once you have students thinking for themselves, you can expect for your students to eventually challenge you—the definition of a great teacher according to Aristotle: 

The mode of being of a non-living object is referred to as being extant. To be extant means it has been observed (or deduced) by an existing, sentient observer. The difference between extantness and existence is called the ontological difference. Extantess is a two-way process. Without the observer the unobserved 'thing' has no concept, no definition. Nevertheless, all unobserved things can be deemed to be extant under the group of 'unobserved things' - which we can safely say there are. it is I am Despite sharing the same verb, to exist, the subjective existence of a living person is of a different order from that of an observed thing. That's where the mystery begins. Edit Judging by your update, you are concerned with extantness. So consider the existence of a tachyon. The concept of a tachyon has been established as a seemingly possible thing. However, no one has found one yet so it 'is' still just a mere concept. One might suppose that if tachyons exist but no people had ever existed the tachonys would continue to exist. However, there would be no concept of tachyon - no discrimination of one part of reality from another - so how could a 'tachyon' exist? Thus objective existence (extantness) is the interaction between observer and object.

It is in organising that small portion of the world, by power of will - both unconscious and deliberate - that meaning is created. 

Re: "how can so many people act so illogically?" Human beings evolved in tribes, (by survival of the fittest tribes), so individual rationalisation is not elementary. Collective behaviour is the instinctive norm. Furthermore, the art of reasoning came late to the game. Trial and error is the default way of finding out what works, which is why ritual is so prevalent in our cultures.

Preamble Your fears are regrettably well-founded. Unlike mathematical logic, the philosophy of language is not so clear cut and remains to this day a deeply controversial topic. There are a dozen schools of thought on the philosophy of language, both classical and contemporary. It is a fundamental and unquestionably significant field of philosophical inquiry, but unfortunately what appears as a stream of simple concepts that should be amenable to science soon reveals itself as an inconsistent web of increasingly intricate questions and facts rapidly give way to opinions. The philosophy of language divided, and continues to divide, the analytic philosophers—who are known for their predilection for rigour, valid method and proof. While I would love to hand you a shiny Cambridge or Springer text in the philosophy of language, I am afraid there is no definitive work. There are commentaries and historical discussions but these will not suffice at all. What I recommend instead is this: if you are sufficiently intrigued and if you have the time to spare, read through the texts I have listed below, which come straight from the field's most significant philosophers themselves. For if it is not possible to find an objective and rigorous account of something, one must build an internal consensus for themselves, generating an objective account from a rigorous treatment of the intersubjective account. Some essential texts Gottlob Frege - On Sense and Reference 

The Socratic Method is the best way to teach any person because it requires that the pupil make attempts to solve the problems before being comprehensively shown how to do so. Philosophy is a prime example, but it applies to everything, even mathematics or computer programming. In philosophy, mathematics, computer programming, lecturers often say something like: 

I can imagine that it may often be difficult for responses on philosophy.stackexchange to be correctly called 'answers' since there must always be room for interpretation and evaluation in philosophical matters, but allow me to give you my views on your question and from it perhaps you will be able to discover an answer for yourself if not for everyone. Continental philosophy has profoundly—albeit misguidedly—influenced art, literature and film throughout the world. Analytic philosophy has inspired developments in mathematics and computer science, shaped the scientific method, and informed quantitative approaches to psychology and sociology. Both branches have elicited developments in linguistics. What continental philosophy has not done is continue developing in its original spirit; even since Sartre, continental philosophy has rather begun to regress or become blended with analytic flavours, with such notions as embodiment blending ideas from Kant, Husserl, Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty and others. Conversely, analytic philosophy has continued developing in the same way but in increasingly insignificant increments as it gradually cedes much of its original lines of inquiry to the sciences. This is the primary distinction between the two branches of philosophy: analytic philosophy walks hand in hand with science and scientism; continental philosophy focuses on the poetic and metaphysical understanding of the world. Analytic philosophy divides the world into subject and object; continental philosophy seeks to unite observer and observed to reach a fundamental and unbounded picture of both. Analytic philosophy seeks to simplify philosophy through demarcation, whilst continental philosophy is concerned with questions that are intuitively more fundamental even than science or logic. Analytic philosophy might be said to have had the more profound influence in contemporary academic circles, but what does that actually mean? Analytic philosophy has no purpose, because its goals are either impossible or fall to scientific endeavours to complete. Continental philosophy has arguably seen less academic attention (or at least less academic understanding/improvement) but the ideas of phenomenology, existentialism and deconstruction have disseminated globally and inspired vast amounts of creative work—though often the ideas are distorted or misinterpreted in such works, as is usually the case when an academic concept reaches the populace. Judging which branch of contemporary philosophy has had the more profound influence will depend on what you personally think is more profound: the sciences or the humanities. Or perhaps not, if you think as I think: that analytic philosophy is not philosophy at all, but rather an auditing process for scientific enterprise. Continental philosophy represents, to me, a truer philosophy, especially through Heidegger and the break with the Cartesian tradition of subject/object opposition and through Derrida's subsequent refinement of destruktion as deconstruction. Within the academic discipline of philosophy itself, it is difficult to judge which branch had the more profound impact. Philosophy finds itself in troubled water these days, unsure of whether it is a science or an art; you will find academics undertaking scientific studies of a psychological/neurological character calling it philosophy, and likewise you will find people still agonising over Aristotle, Chrysippus, Kant, Hegel, Husserl, and so on—and as Derrida certainly demonstrated, no philosophers will truly lose their significance, because their ideas were defined and remain defined by their opposition to each other and to the times, and that these definitions are traces of a genealogy of meaning that will not end. We might say that Continental philosophy affirms philosophy as a subject and gives it life, paves the way for future study and creation. In contrast, analytic philosophy might be said to be less constructive, narrowing philosophy down according to scientific standards over which philosophy ought to preside. I do not mean to say that analytic philosophy is only logical positivism, but analytic philosophers do not do what philosophers must by definition do: question themselves and their methods. 

"Is there no more to time and space than the temporal and spatial relations which hold between events and objects?" Time and space can't be classed together in this way to answer this question, since their reality is different: Space relates to 'spatial relations' between objects, but time relates to the movement of objects in space. Space (between things) exists in the here and now - just like the present - but the past and future exist only in our cognitive experiences. 

Derrida analysed and developed Freud's theories in The Postcard, specifically in the essay To Speculate--on "Freud", an extended commentary on Beyond the Pleasure Principle. Freud published Beyond the Pleasure Principal in 1920, shortly after World War I. Mankind going to war contradicted his Pleasure Principle, so he proposed the Death Drive. As it were, an opposing drive. In fact, the answer lay deeper and connected with his other observations on the repetition compulsion. As Derrida observes, the root of the repetition compulsion is a deep desire to understand problems. (The relief/pleasure of solving them links to the Nirvana principle.) People are drawn to repeat what they do not understand. It is part of the mechanism that enables a person to master their environment - an essential for survival. Tenacity and problem solving can spill over into OCD because the drive is deep and not primarily conscious. E.g. the unputdownable crossword puzzle. Mastery can make a person able to flourish and build, but then again it can lead to invasion and plunder. Historically, and in uncivilised times, this is survival of the fittest. The primary drive for Mastery aligns with the most basic evolutionary principle. The pleasure principle is not opposed to mastery, however it is subservient to it, in the same way as the pleasure principal is subservient to the Reality Principle. The Reality Principle differs from the drive for mastery in that is it more conscious and deliberative. The death drive is one name for the drive for mastery. Another would be the war drive, or contrastingly, the civilisation-building drive / culture-building drive. It is only because it is more complex than the pleasure principle that is can appear to oppose it, for example when it provokes war, or simply when the unputdownable crossword puzzle drives you to distinctly unpleasureable distraction.
