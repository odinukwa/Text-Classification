Recoil is going to be an issue. Lets assume you are able to launch low cost, aimable projectiles (so you give it an initial boost through chemical or electromagnetic means) for longer range use, or slam a slug the size of a standard 1 TEU container right through an enemy ship (or into it). Any force imparted to the slug will be imparted to the ship. A launch along the axis of the ship will slow you down. A launch at an angle will make you slow down and potentially roll, so you'd need to compensate for that. There's some situations where oldschool projectile artillery makes sense. Surface bombardment is a role similar to what the last battleships excelled at. It may make sense with short range combat with high velocity rounds, essentially the space equivilent of a dual to the death inside a elevator, and for point defence. There could be unusual uses for a large ship gun - first stage launch for self guding type rounds. The initial boost saves propellent on the torpedo itself, saving mass for longer range and course correction (which is a idea 'modern' artillery has embraced) Unlike a torpedo, these rounds would be smaller (and harder to detect), have great range (since they already have a sizable launch velocity) and fairly cheap. As for the rounds themselves. I'd consider a few options. The oldschool bag and projectile design is silly. You don't want debris floating around your ship. Something self contained would be a great idea and if you can reduce recoil it would be awesome. The design of the Armburst might be an idea - having a 'standard' propellent canister that acts as propellent, and counterweight. You'd load a round, and this instead of a 'bag' - fire, and the propellent 

No oxygen and moisture. Actually not that hard. Something similar to cosmoline would form an effective barrier. Basically something thick and goopy which won't react (too much) with iron, and reacts the right way with oxygen. This simply means they'd care about the objects enough to pack them away properly. I'd also add, hardened cosmoline is a pain to remove. I'm thinking tar might work, but can't really find any literature to it. Sacrificial protection might be another option - zinc was smelted in the 6th century and available in pure form in the 9th century. If folk noticed that it kept stuff from being damaged in contact with the metal, and valued it enough to store their iron objects with a ton of zinc ingots in contact with them 

Its always useful to use an enemy's strength against it, and physics. If we're talking giant monsters though... Great big pit of quicksand or some non newtonian fluid. Find something that the monster likes, draw it in, let it sink in. Quicksand is probably more useful - you can control its properties with water flow - as the mythbusters did, and drain it to 'lock' the creature in a bunch of sand. Oobleck would allow the creature to sink in, and react by stiffening to more violent movement. Of course. Then what But that's outside the cope of the question. 

Its 1885. Rockets. Black powder's pretty common, and I believe guncotton was a thing, if doc could find the materials. Stick a load of disposable, simple paper tubed rockets on the back of the car to give it a push. Could even use mr fusion moved sideways to stick the rockets in. Rocket science isn't just for the 70s ;). Not quite a delorean, and somewhat more modern rockets but... 

Architecture. Small, tightly packed roofs of varying levels would make landing a pain. Also having layer cakes of construction mean you can't actually get to the places you want to go to by air. Better alternatives airplanes might be kinda obsolete when you have high speed trains that are just as fast. You might have exotic ground effect craft that're just as fast and silent. Also, less likely to hit a building. Geography and weather Massive geoengineering projects littering the wastelands, making level flight implausible. Great huge storms of dust clogging up engines - like that icelandic volcano. Have them random enough (or have man made ones as a standard weapon) would stop airflight 

Both examples I gave fill an ecological niche. Maybe your "low dirty creatures" are an effective form of waste processing. 

There's a couple of possibilities - wings as additional body parts may not actually give flight. They might work as sensory organs, work with other abilities (electro magnetic mind manipulation?) or such. They might even work as a way of cooling the body as part of other processes, or have some other mundane biological use. In short, while they look like bird, bat or pterasaur wings, they might not work to fly. Consider the cultural implications of this - a angel without the wings would be fairly hard to differentiate from a human. Might be different for a demonic entity. Architecture would be affected (for back mounted wings would surely knock things over.) In sense in the right societies, wings may be a badge of office - "its a messenger from god!" or work the other way. It might be a plot point - China Melville's Perdido street station had a winged sentient creature whose wings were chopped off for a crime. Alternately they may be able to fly under specific circumstances. Taking off may be a pain but they may have towers to "take off" (or even catapults). 

Alcohol is actually a pretty energy dense substance. However, why this would be preferred to simple sugars (which is a typical food source) would be interesting - perhaps the gut flora of the rats efficiently breaks down 'poor' foodstuffs like grass into Cellulosic ethanol. Contrast this with cattle, which need multiple stomachs to digest food - some handwaving required, but it would be an unusual metabolic process. The rats might 'seem' fat from their metabolic processes, and breaking down large amounts of cellulose to alcohol, stored in their liver, and other body parts. While typically the maximum percentage of alcohol in solution is limited by how misible it is in water, some processes of natural reverse osmosis or such might be able to increase the concentration of it. Or the creatures might have a tolerance to natural toxins that would increase the effect of the booze on others. Essentially they eat things nothing else would, to handle mild scarcity, and turn that into a high energy food. As for one member sacrificing itself - they might have a social structure similar to the naked mole rat. This lets the colony eat, and when food is scarce, they sacrifice themselves to provide a large food source. The drunk 'predator' gets swarmed, eaten and cached. This would have to be rare enough that anything other than the most intelligent predator doesn't catch on though.
