Research (terms used in searches): Implications of "eternal life" -bible -religion -belief - faith immortality Most scientific answers refer to the study (and more imminent possibility) of biological immortality 

The premise What would be the consequences of transferring the consciousness of a middle-aged person to a mechanical object or device (such as a robot), as opposed to another biological body? Specifically, self awareness, inner thoughts, complete memories (implying continuity of identity), to be transferred to a machine which could function and have abilities completely different than those of a human body, and well beyond its limitations, including infinite existence The object would be capable of storing new memories and experiences (including the transfer itself), be able to learn new things continuously, and at least match our brain's complexity (~85 billion neurons and all current synapses) including ability to imagine, and "forget" or filter memories deemed unimportant or not useful for a given situation. This would mean that the individual would also be able to have intuition, empathy, be inspired, ecstatic, impressed, philosophical, hopeful, but also disappointed, sad, devastated, depressed, cold, or desperate, like any other human being. Another aspect: a third of our days are spent sleeping, so this will automatically increase the accumulated knowledge/experience without the need for sleep and its by-process - dream To eliminate a controversial subject: it is given that the transfer would be instantaneous and it would terminate the biological body as soon as it is completed, and biological death is perceived by the new consciousness - observing your self from two different perspectives simultaneously is off-topic, as it implies a new consciousness, regardless of how exact the copy of "history" and personality is. The continuation of identity takes place when all sensory inputs of the new object become active The question(s) How can the consciousness safely adjust (psychologically) to the surrounding reality, and its own existence in general, like suppressing subconscious instincts - breathing, hunger, thirst, procreation (sex drive), and accepting the concept of endless life with overwhelming possibilities, compared to the previous mindset of embedded limitations - relatively fragile body, ever-present danger of sickness with pain, and inevitable end of life? (It must cope one way or another, but to eventually emerge without unbearable emotional distress and psychological damage) If this adjustment is possible, is eternal existence truly desirable - with the same personality and self-accepted behaviors, reactions, and subjective defects? What would be the infinite drive or motivation for existence: fears, passions, unhappiness balanced against new notions of satisfaction or joy, abstract appreciation for new forms of art or "beauty". Or would feelings and emotions become irrelevant over time? How would "good" and "evil" transform or be perceived? What is the ultimate benefit of immortality once an individual achieves their full potential? Would a "full potential" be achieved? I guess, this transfer would mean a fundamental change in mentality, from the known evolutionary process of genetic transfer, to continual self evolution and improvement, ... but to what end - why do we desire to live forever? Why do we want to be perpetually aware, when we don't know the meaning of our existence as it is now (minimalist suffering), contentment? Ps. Our minds can't hope to fathom the concept of infinity - no beginning and no end, EVER ! - so we just gave it a label, not to deal with its disturbing, unimaginable magnitude (for both time and space), never mind "looking back on your life after a few trillion years, as if it were a second ago" 

Often times people who have a personality that compels them to think, however noble the act of thought might be, shall find in odd moments that they are in a desperate way. I had a bit of an epiphany a couple of months ago that there is a right and wrong way of being right. It is not so much the possession of truth that matters; it is the way that you go about carrying that truth, or if you feel that you have not yet discovered it, the way you go about handling that fact. All in all, life is about having an adventure. And to do this, you have to come to a point where you can accept that there are some things that you cannot understand. At this point it is important that instead of giving into despair, you come to terms with this fact, and play the game of life anyway. It is natural to spend our teenage years disillusioned with the structures of society. This attitude often finds its way in even matured individuals. Our culture propagates messages of individualism and rebellion. But I think that when you are at peace with yourself you begin to find that a large part of who we are consists in what humanity is. Instead of looking at your neighbor and judging them to be a part of some dull collective, we should begin to look at our neighbor and marvel that they are quite like us, despite the worlds of difference that we think exists between us. Compassion and love are the truest signs of a healthy person. I would suggest to you that instead of focusing on whether your thinking is harmful or not (which is a pursuit that, ironically enough, is still dictated by an obsession with thought), take a walk through some parks and speak with people you would not normally speak to. In short, have an adventure. 

Ever since the "linguistic turn", philosophers have been keenly aware of the need of analyzing certain questions about language. In retrospect, John Searle, in Expression and Meaning, notes "the philosophy of language is a branch of the philosophy of mind; therefore no theory of language is complete without an account of the relations between mind and language and of how meaning is grounded in the more biologically basic intrinsic intentionality of the mind/brain." Searle seems to be saying this: talking about facts of language presupposes commitment to facts about the psychology of humans who are language users. An argument for this conclusion could be along this thread: 

By 'presuppose' it isn't meant that every philosophy of language must include an account of the mind by a necessary law. Instead, 'presuppose' means to describe this derivation relation, and the idea that a philosophy of language won't be comprehensive if it doesn't take account of facts about language users. It is also to suggest that accounts that do not see a distinction between language and thought are not accounts in the philosophy of language, but rather the philosophy of mind. Finally, if this argument is sound, it seems to establish that language use is not an autonomous activity, but is instead a mode of expression made possible because certain non-linguistic things operate in a certain way. 

I would answer the first question with a resounding 'yes', in this sense: that overthinking isn't a problem because of the 'thinking' but because of the 'over'. The problem with overthinking is that it takes a good thing, namely thinking, and stretches it out of its natural role in our lives. Thought, when out of proportion with our life, is especially harmful. As one of my idols, G.K. Chesterton, once wrote: 

The influence of external things (den Einfluß äusserer Dinge) affects the inner sense, as a modification of time. As Allison (Kant´s Trascendental Idealism, 2004) notes, the distinction between the two "apperceptions" is troublesome as Kant sometimes tends to identify inner sense with empirical apperception. Anyway, intern sense has nothing to do with apperception. 

A good question. It is remarkable how near is the later Schelling of the question of being introduced by Heidegger.I don´t know the historical answer to your question, because I don´t know the biographical context of Heidegger. Anyway, I find both in Philosophie der Mythologie and Ph. der Offenbarung the annunciation of the big topics of heideggerian thought. For example, the idea of a pure being who escapes to any thought that Schelling calls "A⁰" or "das Unvordenkliche" or "das rein Seyende". 

"Effectiveness" is a good word to translate "Wirklichkeit". "Wirken" is to have an effect. Sometimes it is used to denote the actuality, as Weissman said, of something, for example, the empirical world. Reality doesn´t need to be empirical. Anyway, it depends of which philosophy are you translating. "Effectiveness" has an existential connotation that goes along with the notion of Wirklichkeit of Schelling and Kierkegaard. Kind regards. 

The aim of Schelling´s positive philosophy is to think the existence (the "quod") and not the essence (the "quid") as negative philosophy had done. That is the reason why he speaks about the "Daß" of God and not about the "Was" (the essence) of God. For Hegel, the Absolute´s necessity is contained in the concept. The whole phenomenology of spirit is a logic consequence of that original necessity of the concept. The Absolute of positive philosophy is not necessary but free. The abyss of God, is not a "Was" but a "Daß". God, that is, the Absolute, is first of all a existence (das rein Seyende), and only then a essence (Gottheit, Wesen). The Absolute of the late philosophy of Schelling is a "living" God, that is, God is no chained to any logical necessity. God is an absolute abyss of freedom. 

The transcendental apperception is the "I think" that goes with all my representations. That is, when I perceive a table, I know that representation belong to one "I". On the other side, the empirical apperception is to recognise the identity between the phenomenon of the table and my representation of the table. Kind regards. EDIT: and yes, I think that that description is pretty good. EDIT 2: Aputsiaq correctly noted one mistake at my answer: "the empirical apperception has to do with the external sense". That´s totally incorrect as for Kant: 

I think that this is not in accordance with positive philosophy but with the "Identitätsphilosophy". Schelling´s dissatisfation deals with the fact that neither Kant nor Fichte had attempted to think the prius of philosophy as a pure existence (Fichte tried, but he ended in a subjetivism). Kind regards 

It can be said that while Marx takes the structure of Hegel´s dialectics and then invert it, Schelling criticises a more fundamental principle of his thought. For Schelling (his late philosophy) Hegel is a panlogician-pantheist. His God/Absolute moves from the concept to the Idea with a irrevocable necessity. Schelling opposes then a "living God", that is, a God that can come or not into being. A God that can be "B" in a moment, and then become "not B" (for example). A God that has an in-conscience Grund. A God that has a Past (!) and an history of his revelation.
