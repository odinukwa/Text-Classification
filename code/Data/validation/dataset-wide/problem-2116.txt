I would say no. Most of recruiters / HR personnal would still expect to see your CV in a traditional printable format. However, it is worth including a link in it to your SO Careers page. That's what I did; it seems that recruiters find it fascinating and it helps me stand out of the crowd. (This is just a feeling though, with no facts to back it up. The length and breadth of my professional experience and the tone of my CV seems to stand out of the crowd by itself - for better or worse -, so it is hard to gauge the effect of the SO Careers link in isolation.) 

Those that can't take you seriously will not join your company in the first place. But once someone joined, they will most likely be positive about you, to avoid cognitive dissonance if nothing else. Unless you yourself disappoint them, of course. If you introduce yourself to them like you do here, you set extremely high expectations, thus you have to be really really good to live up to your own promise. 

That may or may not be the case, as you yourself list other possibilities among the disadvantages. Moreover, not being occupied by money does not necessarily mean that one really cares about his work and is good at it. So if you want to give the impression of someone who is so passionate about his/her job as to not think about anything else, I believe a positive approach is better: tell them about what you do feel important in your profession and how that shows, instead of stating what else you do not feel important. My personal feeling is that if you tell you don't care about money, employees in general are more likely to see you in a disadvantageous light. Or both, at best: they may acknowledge you are so passionate about your craft, and at the same time be happy to exploit you via cheap wages, as long as you are willing to take it. I think it is important for you to realize that in the long run, you owe your own personal and professional reputation to ask for a decent salary for your good work. If you do a great service to your employer, solving their problems, you are actually earning / saving them hard money, so it is only fair to get a decent pay in exchange. No need to go overboard of course, but if you yourself don't represent your own interests, noone else will. Not caring about the money, or even working for free, may work though if done for a relatively short and concrete time interval, and as part of a longer term plan. So if you want to get your first job as a newbie, to get experience and build reputation (with which after a couple of years you will be able to get a more decent job with a better salary), it's fine. Or if you desperately want to get your dream job at a dream company, you may decide to offer them your services cheaply or even for free for a well defined trial period, let's say 3 months. That should be enough for you to demonstrate them your real value, and then negotiate a full employee position with proper salary. Or get quickly fired after being exploited, if they don't actually want to treat you fairly... there is always the risk. By limiting the length of such an experiment in advance, you limit your potential losses too. 

4) If you haven't already, require your associates set annual goals and a development plan and use these meetings to go over their progress. You want to be careful here because you don't want the one-on-one to turn into a status meeting (really there are better tools for that available). But you do want your associates to be thinking about long term strategy, setting annual goals and where they sit on their development plan. Require your team have defined developmental goals alongside their company-based goals and keep them honest about their progress. If your associates don't have immediate needs during their one-on-ones then turn the meeting into an opportunity for reflection and motivation. 

I actually have to disagree with the other posts that say your current situation isn't a problem. I actually think that you are describing very serious issues in your current environment that need to be addressed before they become fatal problems. There are two two serious questions that you need to get answered soon: 

It is too easy to look at salary amount and make a blanket value statement as to whether a compensation package is better or worse. But to truly compare compensation packages, you need to take a lot of other factors into account. These can include other additional compensation elements such as : 

I think if your boss is as cool as you describe him, he will surely understand that people change jobs every now and then. And if you really want to go, you will go no matter what he does; he can only make the parting faster and/or sourer. Which he wouldn't like to do if he values you. From his perspective, if you are going to leave, it is still better if you don't stray very far in your new job. Having you in a new role at a partner company with close ties to them can be benefitial to both of you, so this can bring new opportunities to him as well (depending on your role at the new company). So I would just tell what you told here: you are happy with your current job and could continue here, but you got a rare opportunity to fulfill your long term dream. So you hope he will understand this, and (in case you get the new job) you will be more than happy to continue cooperation in your new role, to the mutual benefit of both companies and both of you. 

Mentioning to HR that you have another offer should not be a problem in itself - every job seeker is looking for multiple options, just as well as every company is interviewing multiple candidates before hiring. And the better you are, the more options you have. So it might even increase your desirability, but certainly won't decrease it. I think it is also OK to ask for a timeframe, you just need to be careful to avoid making the impression that you are pressurizing them for a decision. That would basically be the same trick as what HR at company A is playing with you when they say you need to decide about their offer by Wednesday. And since HR people all know this trick, most of them probably don't like it applied on them ;-) From what you describe, this may be interpreted by B in a bad way. To make a decision, you need to rank your priorities. Is it more important for you to get a job fast, even if it is less than ideal, or are you looking for the best job you can get, even if it takes longer time to land in it? Assuming the latter, my suggestion is 

You mention in your comments that you are part of the core IT team. It seems to me that the reason you are having trouble motivating these users is because your team is overreaching in their responsibilities. Given that you are an IT associate, I'm assuming these users don't report up through your direct IT management hierarchy? That means this work would be completely voluntary on top of their normal duties (which as you are seeing is a really hard sell to someone who is already busy). The benefit of an ambassador program is self-apparent (we have something similar at my Enterprise) but this directive ultimately needs to come from the business leadership. Rather than try to have your IT team indirectly supervise these ambassador's themselves, why not try convincing their direct managers of the benefits of the program and allow them to manage it themselves? If you can get management buy-off, then they can pick the superusers that they feel are most appropriate and rearrange their existing duties as necessary. My IT team stays relatively hands off with our ambassadors letting business assign and control direct responsibilities themselves but do set some high-level expectations which gives us what we need in the relationship. For instance, when filing trouble tickets against certain applications we ask that our ambassadors act as gate keepers to review any reported problem before filing a ticket. This helps us filter out clear user-error issues and free up IT application team time for more pressing issues (such as developing improvements to the same application). It is a win-win for both departments so we have come to a mutually beneficial arrangement. TLDR - I would recommend getting your business team management on board and let them manage their part of the program themselves. Set IT expectations and allow business to police themselves to come up with a mutually beneficial arrangement. 

(as I noted above) she may be from a different culture / generation and is unaware of the unwritten local norms she may have a pressure on her to finish tasks asap she may feel the meeting is unproductive and is wasting her time she may be the single expert on her field, and is constantly in demand 

I agree with the earlier answers. One note: even if your request is rejected now, you may start working in CO and establish your reputation within the company. After a year or two, you may start looking for relocation opportunities within company, and discuss your wish with your manager. This is possible and supported in most large companies. Accepting a colleague who has already proven to be a good fit to the company culture and shown his/her worth in a different branch / team is very different from accepting a total outsider, however promising (s)he may look like. 

I don't think it matters directly. I.e. I can't imagine any recruiter paying attention to which city you got your experience with technology X in. Your choice has indirect consequences though. In big cities with busy IT life, you obviously have more work opportunities to choose from in the long run, but also fiercer competition. More challenges can help you grow, but can also crush you. Moreover, you have more opportunities to network with like minded people, participate in local user groups etc. which can help improving your skills and career chances if used wisely. However, now in the internet age, you can self study and connect to fellow developers from almost everywhere if you have the determination. And one final point, which may actually be the most important in the long run: career growth and salary are good things, up to a point. But (IMHO) these shouldn't be the sole aim of one's life, rather just means to create and secure the life one desires. So the overall quality of life is important. Making a big career and earning lots of money via spending a large part of your life in a city which is polluted, ugly and hostile may actually make you burn out or even ill in the long run, which, needless to say, breaks your career too. Depending on your preferences, you may very well be better off living in a clean, beautiful and friendly place even if you earn less money and don't get as high promotions as fast. But happiness and satisfaction with your life makes you perform better at work too in the long term. 

I find many of the answers listed here troubling as the advice is fairly poor and generally lacking of compassion. I too was the victim of an assault around the same age (though mine only included physical violence). At a time in my life when I was quite vulnerable, I was befriended by a group of older adults, taken to a party and gotten very intoxicated at which point I was falsely accused of something, summarily beaten unconscious by an older man and left with permanent physical scars as a result. I experienced the similar taunting and alienation the morning after the incident and I too refused to go to the Police because of the embarrassment and personal responsibility I accepted for putting myself in the situation. It's been two decades since the incident and it still enters my mind from time to time. Unless you have been the victim of some physical violence, you really cannot understand the trauma that it puts on a person's mind. My assault was only physical and so I cannot even begin to imagine the intensity that the sexual aspect lends to it. So I think the first thing that someone needs to say is: The feelings that you are experiencing are absolutely and completely reasonable. Being unexpectedly confronted with this intensely painful event from your past at your place of work is not something you should be forced to deal with. You do have options available to you and you are not powerless - though to the other poster's points - you will need to tread extremely careful so as not to be seen as the aggressor. Talk to your manager. I cannot disagree more with the poster who said not to do this. If you have a halfway decent relationship with your boss, then describe to him/her your situation without going into any of the detail you listed above. Focus on the facts only - you were the victim of a sexual/physical assault some years ago, a person related to the incident just joined the company, you are having extreme difficulty focusing on your work with them in close proximity. I would strongly recommend keeping the other woman's identity anonymous. Tailor the message around this being a problem with you and this environment. There are a few options available to your manager at this point and most likely he/she will get HR involved (after all this type of situation is exactly why HR exists). As a manager myself I would absolutely want to know if one of my associates was struggling with something like this. Pending this conversation, some possible responses that immediately come to mind: 

I think that from your points it already shows fairly well, that it is most likely not going to do you a service to continue this in the long run. 

Instead of debating over whether or not this is bad meeting etiquette, I would first find out if her behaviour bothers other participants, disrupts / slows down the meeting in any way or causes any noticeable concrete problem. If so, you can go back to her saying that she is wasting other people's time and/or causing problems and politely but firmly ask her to change. If not, you should just accept her behaviour. Meetings are about solving problems and making decisions, not about etiquette. It is also possible btw that she is from a different cultural background than you, where her behaviour is completely normal and accepted, whereas in your culture it may not be. Then again, unless there is noticeable harm, you should try to accept that people and cultures are different. Update To clarify, and to reflect on comments: my point is that what the OP expresses above is basically his personal opinion (being annoyed by the other person's behaviour). He certainly has the right to be annoyed, as well as to ask the other person to change her behaviour to prevent that. However, the goal should be clear first. There is difference between 

With a resounding Yes, it is a bad habit! You have described yourself at a very early stage in your career (being just 3 years in) so I do not think it is too far off to suggest that you are developing patterns now which will likely persist through much of your adult life. The pace with which you are currently managing your routine is simply not sustainable... I don't care what anyone else tells you. At your young age, you will certainly be able to keep it up for a longer period of time than say someone who is in their 40s or 50s but at a certain point that stress is going to build up and it's going to burn you out. Any work is a barter scenario.. at the end of the day, you are selling your time for as much money as you can. Would you keep showing up if they stopped paying you? Probably (hopefully) not. You've got to ask yourself what are you trying to accomplish by pulling a 60+ hour work week? (And trust me that's what you are doing if you are continuing to do work-related research at night). The answer is most likely: trying to increase your expertise so that you can increase that per hour rate. Hourly and salaried positions in most Western countries are measured by an expected 2080 (40 hrs/wk) hour per year. When you change those base hours to 3120 (60 hrs/wk) you are effectively reducing your per hour rate substantially. More importantly, you need to think of the longer term effect of burnout: What is the point of trying to maximize your per hour rate if in trying to increase that per hour rate you effectively drop it down to $0/hr? When dealing with a troublesome work/life balance, there are a couple of tough truths you need to realize: 

Sounds like your problem is not so much with communication skills in general as with understanding and using English (a foreign language to you - as for many of us). To improve this, you need more practice and experience with English. Probably you aren't the only one having such problems at your company, so I suggest you to start by discussing this with your coworkers to find others in the same situation. The more you are, the more weight your plea has when you turn to management for help (which should be the next step). Management may help you by arranging (or sponsoring) training with native English teachers to improve your English vocabulary (in general or on a specific area/domain), verbal skills, comprehension of specific accent(s), expressing your thoughts flexibly and effectively etc. If this is unattainable, you may try enrolling to an English course yourself, or do self study: 

I think you need to understand the different cultural background of people from Eastern countries (in the broad sense). In these cultures openly admitting a fault is seen as a weakness and personal loss, hence people try to avoid this at all costs and fight back at any perceived attempt to criticize them or their actions or decisions. Which of course does make it very challenging for people from other cultures to work with them and solve problems together, but this is just a given which IMO you need to understand. So if you want to continue working with them and succeed with the project, I think you'd better avoid any direct criticism, and try to frame it instead as an improvement idea, or try to give them subtle hints only and allow them to "invent" the great idea by themselves. In this way their ego will not be threatened and they can be made to accept new ideas. The obvious backside is that they will most likely take the credit for any success and any novel idea. If you can live with that, go ahead; if not, try to get out of this as soon as possible.
