Also the pool have make at least 600 directories on your root disk, where your os lives and this is an issue also... a lot of read/write the compilers, the email that you have give with your sites, the iis log files, the cache file... too many sites... 

I am hosting on server4you.net some years now with 2 server and never have serious problems. They are good and have low price. I like them a lot. 

First, firewall stop RDP only if you let it do. You can enable it again by opening the port. But also I suggest to change the default RDP port, and then just add it to the firewall to permit it. How to change the listening port for Remote Desktop $URL$ $URL$ Second, use a tunneling program to connect to your server and be real safe, because this way no one can snif your interaction with the server. Plesk install by default a tunelling server, also bitvise is very good and free for one connection only. So to synopsis. Use tunnelling, change the default port on RDP and tunneling, open this posts on firewall, connect only using tunneling, also use SSL on your ftp connections, and finally use a port scanning program with your firewall. To avoid problems with the firewall, make run a script on windows starts that turn off the firewall. This way if for any reason a program change the open ports on firewall and you fail to login, you make a remote reboot and on restart you are back again. This saves more for a lot of time. 

I currently have two OS images. Ideally I'd like both to be available to all unknown computers. For now though, just one would be fine. Let's say I have image1 and image2. Image1 was used in a task sequence and deployed to "All Unknown Computers." This worked fine, I created a new task sequence using image2 but I would still only have the choice for image1 after PXE booting. I removed both deployments and re-added the deployment for image2. This image was installed, but the image was corrupted so I get an error of "No bootable device found." However the real issue is that I removed the image2 deployment and re-added a deployment for image1. I am able to PXE boot and in PXESMS.log it reads 

The memory limit is going to be a huge problem for that many databases. It may also stil be a problem in Web if you are using a low end edition of the Windows Server. The web edition is limited only to the memory resources of the host operating system. You may want to check out the features of all the versions. In the end the Web version may not be the right choice either. 

It's possible to just add two websites to IIS and use different Host Headers as splattne said. This is the easiest way to do it. Then just add the "site name" as an cname record in DNS and point it to your A name. IIS tree: Web Sites -> Server (host header of 'server.mydomain.tld') -> StudentNet (host header of 'studentnet.mydomain.tld') DNS Tree A Host Host '@' Points To '111.222.333.444' CNAME Host 'server' Points To '@' Host 'studentnet' Points To '@' Edit: Not sure what happened to my formatting. It looks so nice in edit mode. 

I'm sorry for the ambiguity of this post but I was left with quite a mess it seems. I recently came on to this job and there was a deployment of about 120 Windows 8 tablets to 4 different schools. I don't know who created the image or how they were planning to manage the tablets and I am unable to even find out who it was. It is set up with an admin account which is also a Microsoft account. There is also a local student account on each machine. The admin account is set as a parent account through family and safety center. The goal of these machines was to have students log in and use some pre-installed educational apps. However, when the student logs in to the local student account, the apps have an (X) on them and if I try to open it, it will bring me to the MS Store and a dialog box appears saying the app needs to be repaired. I click repair, I am prompted to log in with a Microsoft account and I log in with the admin account. This does repair the app and makes all other pre-installed apps work correctly. This only worked up to a point though. Eventually I got an error message that the Microsoft account can only be linked to 81 PCs. I have tried creating a new Microsoft account that is also set as a parent account, but when I use that account to login on the repair screen, nothing happens. I sadly have no idea how I should have these tablets set up. I have tried creating a new account which has been designated as an adult account in family and safety but that did not work. 

I am search to find a program, or a way to block ips that make port scan on the server. The goal is to hide some ports like remote desktop on a different port. So some are search the port with port scanning to locate this port and start the attacks. The server is running Windows Server 2008 64-bit, and its a remote administrate server with iis and mail services mostly. In previus versions of Windows Servers (eg on 2003) I use the comodo firewall that have this ability, but on 2008 comodo just not work and I am searching for something else but still did not found any. Can you please give me some ideas/solutions ? Thank you in advanced. 

It is possible to have hundreds of different websites all pointing to one database. You just need to make sure your host will allow your different domains/sites to connect to the same database. After all it's not the domain name that allows communication between the web and data tiers, it's the hosts server configuration and policies. For example I host one website, but have been thru 2 or 3 different domain names over the past few years. All of the domains point to the same website inside of IIS. Or in the case of one sub-domain points to a different website inside IIS, but still talks to the same database. It's al in your connection strings. However you will most likely not be able to have the database server on one host, and sites on a different host. These ports are normally shut down for standard communuication. Your best bet would be to talk to their technical support to see if it's allowed. 

I created a package for Adobe CC and I was able to distribute it to my main DP successfully. I then deployed the package to a device collection. All the machines come back as In Progress with a description of "Waiting for content." I checked one of the machines giving this error and I see WAS.log: 

If any other information is required please let me know and I will post it. Any help or guidance is greatly appreciated. 

Then the PXE boot loads the required files and boots into Windows PE, but then instead of allowing me to choose which task sequence to use I get the message: "There are no task sequences available for this computer." Seems strange when the log says it is finding an advertisement for me. Any help or guidance would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.
