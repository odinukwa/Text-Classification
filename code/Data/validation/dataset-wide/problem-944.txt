As to whether the amount of oxygen is changing, remember no element can be created or destroyed (aside from nuclear processes). So the only way oxygen can change is if it is tied up in a compound or is removed into the ground or space. In our lifetimes, there is very insignificant change overall, though it sounds like a notable amount is being used up each day in combustion reactions (see the part about oxygen depletion further down) [oxygen decreases from that, but since carbon dioxide has more mass, the overall atmospheric mass actually increases, just not the stuff you can breathe!]. If you're looking for a much longer history, it appears this Britannica article gives a more thorough discussion of the factors in play and some of the changes that have occurred. As to the mass of the atmosphere over eons, I naively thought maybe less would be known about that... but articles in Scientific American and Nature both hint the atmosphere was at much different pressures once upon a time (albeit reaching conclusions in opposite directions!) Such changes in pressure would likely come with large differences in mass and/or volume of the atmosphere as well, but until someone shows me otherwise, those estimates would seem to be quite speculative. And if we're going that direction, maybe we should just turn to What-If XKCD! 

First, yes, DM does appear to be decameters (though Dm would be more proper). D was actually the abbreviation I was taught for deca in grade school 20 years ago, but it appears da has become the official standard prefix now, perhaps because it was confused with deci (d). They also list the spelling deka instead of deca as well, perhaps for similar reasons (though that may well still vary by locale?) 

I don't have the answer for you, but I can point you to the tools that can be used to get such an answer. The Advanced Hydrologic Prediction Service compiles rainfall grids using radar, surface observations, and a variety of other sources. Options offered include daily, month-to-date, and archived data. You can probably quite reasonably put the Shapefile download option into a GIS application, such as Grass GIS or ArcGIS, then limit it to the state (or area of interest) and compute an average or total. Alternative, you can download it as NetCDF, which I know you'd be able to open in GrADS/OpenGrADS, mask it to a certain area using some sort of shape file or geometry, and then run an areal average on it. I really do wish more straightforward, user-adaptable data were easily available (and no guarantee it's not, I just don't know a source). But at least this will give you the tools to figure out. And while you're focused on rainfall, perhaps read up on central California's Great Flood of 1852! 

However, it looks like disappointingly Hawaii (and territories) doesn't get the same data produced, or at least available anywhere I can find on that site. If you really want to seek that out, you might consider using Honolulu and Juan climate reports for a reasonable proxy, or the answer to the question Current Global Climate Dataset? on GSE may offer a rough avenue towards fair gridded information. Not the easiest avenue, would love to see something better (and hopeful if you do go through this tedious method, perhaps post it to a Github repo or such so that more data may be easily available in the future to others facing the same problem. 

That's a loose idea. It's been a while, but basically as I remember it, hydrostatic is strongly valid when vertical acceleration (and thus vertical motion when looking near the surface) is much smaller in scale compared to the horizontal motions/accelerations. So indeed, this is not true in tornadoes and in convection. So you get very correct values for strong thunderstorms. But it will help you diagnose regions of rising motion. You can look a bit more towards breaking it down into more advanced detail and the mathematics of hydrostatic and how it fails in Doswell and Markowski's paper on buoyancy. But, with such limited model output, not sure that you're looking to get into all of that detail, as I don't believe you'll find any extra help going those avenues with the variables you have. With just slightly more information, most importantly temperature, you could use the ideal gas law: 

Based upon links from a similar question on atmospheric distribution in Chemistry SE, I looked into the latitudinal difference by making a couple images using the MSIS model chemistry plotting website (using Janauary 1, 2016, 100 W longitude, 0 km altitude) 

So air after rainfall is cooled in the extreme majority of cases... it's just that your cooled air may instead end up being relocated to other locations. Check out the topic of outflow boundaries So, to your questions: ⇒ Will it be colder right after a storm compared to how it was right before the storm? Most likely ⇒ Will it be colder the day after a storm compared to how it was right before the storm? Depends what the weather pattern and air mass movement is like. If a cold front moves in, yes. If a warm front moves in, no. In the tropics or during the height of summer, it will often be about the same the next day as the atmosphere mixes the cool air from yesterday's rain around until it's spread out and minimized, and the air heats back up again the next day when the sun comes out. ⇒ Will it be colder after a storm than it otherwise would have been without the storm? Basically yes. A nearby site that doesn't get the storm's effects will almost certainly be warmer. 

It may take a few minutes of work this way... But did find digging through NCDC's climate data inventory, the climatological rankings pages should help find what you're looking for if you're looking for their full state averages. However, I think can help you a step further with addresses to go through: if you replace STATENUMBER in the address of: 

Remarkable in that all of NW Washington hadn't seen a tornado warning in almost 20 years. And currently it looks like this: 

Anytime derived values (variables that aren't in the model itself, but require a formula to determine) need calculating, such as total surface heat flux, just make sure that when you combine the variables (in this case the shortwave, longwave, sensible, and latent heats), you only divide by the timestep once (don't divide by 10800 in the separate input variables beforehand, then divide by 10800 again after combining them). The models are strange to many. I just happened to incorrectly remember what a flux was, and get the "divide by 10800" math right (probably in part due to horror memories of working with similar files in years gone by!). But hopefully this helps some confused people! 

The WorldClimate website appears to offer some climate details from a variety of data sources in a rather digestible format. It gives details on the sources for each bit of information, which you may well want to dig into deeper to verify the data is reasonably reliable/representative. To find locations, it seems the best options may be to search the data manually over your region of interest. Start from an address like $URL$ then use the directional controls on the page (or change the URL manually) until you hit other sites. Or, alternatively, you search for known site names (unfortunately not just country names :-/) on the WorldClimate main page to see if you get hits. This list of current reporting station details at UCAR should give some useful possibilities. Doing that, and trying to estimate from your map, it appears Angmagssalik (location) and Danemarkshavn (location) may be your best bets for the info you wish for. 

Reasoning for changes: For the shift from "See Text" to "Marginal", SPC indicated that the trouble was the lack of a precise areal outline. There were also concerns that the "See Text" area could be overlooked or confusing to the public. For the implementation of the "Enhanced" designation, SPC asserts that the "Slight Risk" covered too large a range of potential weather. It definitely is true that "Slight" was by far the most used forecast. I chose a random month prior to the changeover - July 2014... there were 23 days topping at slight risk, 3 days of moderate risks, and 5 see text days. There were also slight realignment by weather type, and downward shifts in a couple spots. The overall changes are summarized in this table of risk criteria: 

Let's start with the simplest fact. With nothing else going on, air in our atmosphere will always be cooled at 5.4°F/1000ft (or the more widely used 9.8°C/km), due to it expanding in size (often times we'll throw a negative sign: -5.4°F/1000ft... this is just to emphasize that these lapse rates are about the air COOLING). Every bit of the rising air cools at that rate (the oxygen, the nitrogen, even any water vapor in the air). All of it will cool at 5.4°F/1000ft. All rising air always expands at this same rate. However sometimes there is a second complicating factor: the rising air may cool to the point where it is holding its maximum quantity of water vapor (because when colder, air cannot hold as much water vapor). When it reaches this point, it is saturated, and any more cooling/rising will force some of its water vapor to condense instead into liquid droplets. For this gaseous water vapor to become a liquid, its particles must expel quite a lot of energy. And that energy gets released into the air. So once air hits this saturation point, though its expansion continues to have a -5.4°F/1000ft impact on the temperature, it also has a second factor, that released phase change energy, warming the air some. The result is that saturated air doesn't cool as fast. 

I'd personally theorize the main answer is mountains. Thinking the key is localized "mesoscale" features that disrupt large-scale patterns. In Florida, it's the surrounding oceans that generate daytime seabreeze storms in the summer and provide moisture return (and thus clouds) more quickly after frontal passages in the winter. In Colorado, would think it's the mountainous terrain causing circulations like the Denver Cyclone creating daytime clouds in the summer, and vertical motion that may well disrupt some of the foggy, stable winter days. Some mesoscale influences create almost continual cloudiness, such as the cold oceans along the US Pacific Coast. Others remove more cloudiness, like the terrain and resulting deserts in much of the US Southwest. For more in-depth details on cloudcoverage, including annual and monthly totals maps, see this us-climate.blogspot.com article. But one key aspect of both the Florida seabreeze and mountainous circulations is that they are diurnal. So, often, whatever they bring in one part of the day, they generate the opposite at the other end of the day. For more about how mountain winds vary through the day, look into mountain and valley breezes. I'd also suggest the greatest proportion of cloudiest (foggiest) days in the US are winter periods where cold air is in place under a high pressure and moisture builds up within the stable conditions. Being elevated in Colorado may additionally aid prevention of some such days by having lower moisture depth and also by being more exposed to winds [while Florida instead is less often deeply entrenched in cold airmasses]. Just thoughts, but hopefully that offers some direction for why it may be! 

Now, actually all typical plots aloft are the varying height values where a given pressure is found (850 mb, 500 mb, 200 mb, etc). Why do we look at height variations on set pressure levels? First, for background, it's important to realize that, by and large, pressure and height are proportional, such that either one can determine a strong approximation of the other. For large-scale weather you can directly invert them using forms of the hydrostatic equation. $$\dfrac{\partial p}{\partial z} = -\rho g$$ Basically this proves extremely accurate when vertical acceleration is small, which is generally anywhere outside of intense thunderstorms. Even when it is less perfect, it's a pretty useful approximation for pressure variations important on the scale of synoptic weather. Actually, the basic weather pressure map we're used to RELIES upon this relationship... typical storm pressures we hear are 900-1000 mb, and maps often look like: 

Multiply by 3.6 to get km/hr. So your range is basically from 3 m/s to 4 m/s. So you're looking at the medium blue color basically. There are some coastal locations. But generally, coastal locations will have quite a bit of wind... 

The best model archive I know of offhand is Iowa State Meteorology's Gempak model data in their MTArchive. Looks like model-wise, they have at least 10 years of GFS (and the predecessor, the AVN). No idea if the models are complete files (include CAPE) or not, though. Gempak software is free, though you won't get graphics nearly as polished as WxBell; they've spent a lot of time fine tuning their setup, and likely use newer more flexible tools (probably GrADS or OpenGrADS, both also free). You could probably get GrADS to use the .gem files, perhaps by converting them? 

In discussions from the National Weather Service, storm systems are often quantified in terms of DM, such as in this forecast discussion from Los Angeles/Oxnard on February 15, 2017: 

Doesn't look like the ECMWF does. Perhaps part of it has to do with the fact the weather changes due to eclipses are usually fairly friendly/tame. This GOES 16 satellite loop from the southeast US during the eclipse shows a large percentage of the cumulus buildup dissipating as solar input dropped. And this great meteogram from the Oklahoma Mesonet (this site is Blackwell, Oklahoma in northern Oklahoma, though most sites show some impact) shows the slump in solar radiation, temperature, and wind very well on the early afternoon of August 21, 2017 (near the middle of the time period of the graph): 

As I understand it, this suggests there is over 15% less oxygen at some latitudes than others. But that it's still approximately the same percentage of the overall air. As to why: 

Very importantly, the Fujita scales are damage scales, simply because it's very difficult to directly measure the speeds of a tornado. As such we base tornado ratings by analyzing the degree which it damaged objects; SPC's Fujita scale page lists the 28 damage indicators currently available as of 2017. The highest wind speed matched with any of them, found when significant structural deformation is done to a high-rise building (over 20 stories tall), would only indicate an upper bound of 290 mph. That does not indicate that wind speeds aren't higher than that, only that we have no structures that can withstand any higher wind speeds. Thus there would not be any potential for an F6 rating unless building methods are substantially changed to withstand stronger speeds, those buildings became prevalent enough that engineering testing were done and were able to verify its strength, and then such an extreme tornado ever hit them. Not something we're going to see anytime soon it appears. So back to the question of whether tornadoes have winds stronger than those listed for an (E)F5? Measurement of the wind speed appears our only real hope of noting such. In-situ instruments such as anemometers generally fail well before winds reach such speeds, and typical radars cannot offer the resolution to diagnose such speeds. Only mobile Doppler radars offer much hope. There are numerous issues with utilizing such measurements, such as the fact they scan significantly above the ground layer, their sampling areas\timescales that make analyzing suction vortices difficult, and they contain uncertainties due to Nyquist frequencies, variations in reflective objects, and statistical distributions. Such tornadoes are very rare to encounter. But in the past couple decades we have indeed managed to attain a handful of close-proximity estimated measurements of strong tornadoes. But I am not aware of any peak estimated wind speed reaching beyond the (E)F5 range. Here are the most notable ones I'm aware of:
