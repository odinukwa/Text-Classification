I think there are a few things to consider. First, a drainage basin is defined as the area upstream of the point to which all precipitation converges. Flow does not converge at the outlet - flow converges at the lake. Outlets don't contain any additional information of the upstream area draining into the lake. This implies that to find the area draining into a lake, you would necessarily have to proceed beginning from each and every inlet. Here's another way to see this. Approximately 20% of all land drains to lakes with no outlets. These are referred to as endorheic lakes or endorheic basins. Even though there is no outlet, there is absolutely still a definable drainage basin area. 

Check out this matlab program that is presented in a paper by Kostadinov and Gilb, 2014. The paper is worth reading, and they have their full matlab code in the "supplement" link (top right corner under downloads). The code launches a GUI. From it you can control the values of obliquity, eccentricity, precession, total solar irradiance, day of year, calendar start year and end year, and latitude. Section 2.1 in the paper explains the coordinate system. I don't think anyone could answer off the top of their heads the question "what is the difference between 1920, 1939, etc... of solar radiation at a particular geo-location". But with this program, you can mess around with the data and find out. So let us know what you discover! (ps, if you don't have Matlab, you can probably use this in octave which is free). Here's a screenshot of the gui 

Given that you are talking about something small and root-hair like there are no such examples occurring with water in the liquid phase. It's more likely you saw ice. In science jargon, what you're referring to are known as fractal structures. Below the pictures, I explain why water in the liquid phase can not produce the specific type of fractal structures you're asking about. If the photos below are not even close to what you were thinking of, and you're sure it wasn't ice, then you probably saw something that wasn't water (for example a clear mold). There's literally an infinite variety of these fractal ice patterns. Try googling the terms fractal, self-organized, self-similar, self-affine, patterned, or dendritic, complex network followed by any of the words frost, ice, ice-crystal, snow, snowflake. 

Disclaimer: this is probably TLWR, but you can absolutely apply some physical reasoning to arrive at the answer. Changes in surface height of the earth are governed by the conservation of mass, i.e. that if mass ($M$) is removed in one location (everglades soil erosion), then an equal amount of mass must be gained at another location (perhaps accretion on the seafloor).The total change in the earths mass is zero $$\Delta M = M_1-M_2=0$$ $$-M_1=M_2$$. Mass may be broken up into the volume ($V=\Delta x \Delta y \Delta z$) multiplied by density ($\rho$), so $M=\rho V$. In terms of the conservation of mass equation from above, then: $$-\rho_{1} \Delta x_1 \Delta y_1 \Delta z_1 = \rho_{2} \Delta x_2 \Delta y_2 \Delta z_{2}$$ The place where erosion occurs is described by the left side (with subscript 1). The place where accretion occurs is described by the right side (with subscript 2). This equation says the total mass lost by area 1, must equal the total mass gained by area 2. Now consider the following two situations. 1) The transported sediment does not undergo any change in density. If the density does not change, you have $\rho_1=\rho_2$. Let's also say the eroding area ($\Delta x_1 \Delta y_1$) equals the accreting area ($\Delta x_2 \Delta y_2$) for simplicity. Then all equal terms in the conservation of mass cancel out and you're left with $$-\Delta z_{1} = \Delta z_{2}$$ 2) The transported sediment does undergo a change in density. There's a host of reasons why density can change. If the density changes then we can't let the density terms cancel in the conservation of mass. Lets still say the eroding area and accreting area are equal. The conservation of mass becomes $$-\rho_1 \Delta z_1 = \rho_2 \Delta z_2$$ or conversely $$-\Delta z_1=\frac{\rho_2}{\rho_1}\Delta z_2$$ This says that the amount of change in height at location 1 is not equal to the amount of change at location 2 (sure they're proportional, but not definitely not exactly equal). Putting it all together to answer the question, the average earth radius (r) is the average of all heights (z) with respect to the center of the earth $$r=\frac{z_1+z_2+...+z_n}{n}$$ Try this all out with arbitrary numbers to convince yourself. Add the changes $\Delta z_1$ to $z_1$, and $\Delta z_2$ to $z_2$ $$r_{before}=\frac{z_1 + z_2 + z_3}{3}$$ $$r_{after}=\frac{(z_1+\Delta z_1)+(z_2+\Delta z_2)+z_3}{3}$$ Rearrange $r_{after}$ to be $$r_{after}=\frac{z_1+z_2+z_3 + (\Delta z_1+\Delta z_2)}{3}$$ Case 1 If density doesn't change (i.e. $-\Delta z_1=\Delta z_2$), then $$r_{after}=\frac{z_1+z_2+z_3 + (\Delta z_1-\Delta z_1)}{3}$$ The changes cancel out and $r_{before}=r_{after}$. The earths radius does not at all change. Case 2 If the density changes, $r_{after}$ becomes $$r_{after}=\frac{z_1+z_2+z_3 + (\Delta z_1-\frac{\rho_2}{\rho_1}\Delta z_1)}{3}$$ and you can see that $r_{after}$ does not equal $r_{before}$. 

In response to comments, it's worth clarifying why small amounts of water cannot form static fractal structures. Water has strong surface tension resulting from the polarity of individual $H_2O$ molecules. Surface tension is the reason water beads up to form smooth edges, which is precisely the opposite condition of fractal structures. There are examples (like the structure left behind as water drips down a window) of limited branching with water, but the branching is physically limited by surface tension that forces smaller nearby water to coalesce with the larger structures. For fractal branching to be significant, you must have more than just a primary and secondary branching. That is to say, no scientist would consider something to be a fractal if it occurs over less than an order of magnitude. Rivers are a different story. Stream networks are fractal by several different measures. However, in line with the details of the question it's important to note the poster asked about water forming a root like structure. The fractality of river networks is a pattern embedded within the earths surface, yes by the action of water, but water alone is not responsible for the network structure. To oversimplify, it's a sediment transport phenomenon, the flow is multi-phase (water + sediment), and therefore this is not just a water-only phenomenon.
