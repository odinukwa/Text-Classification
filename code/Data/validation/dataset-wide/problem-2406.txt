Express this view in your own words; and Carry this view (or not) into how you travel the Eightfold Path? In particular, what are its implications for how you train in ethical discipline and/or concentration? 

I am in no position to speak for the Dalai Lama, though personally confident that he will never abandon Bodhichitta. But I think I can partly answer your question even so. Choosing not to be reborn as the Dalai Lama of Tibet says nothing about whether he might choose to reincarnate in some other form and position that is of greater benefit to beings, and in particular better serves the further development of Tibetan politics and culture. In other words, it certainly doesn't follow from HHDL's statement that he has foregone reincarnation altogether. 

Context First, let me frame my question by establishing a shared understanding of what I mean by "view." Throughout all forms of Buddhism as far as I know, the Four Noble Truths are considered essential Buddhadharma. Included in the 4th Truth is the Eightfold Path, which Bhikkhu Bodhi (in Noble Eightfold Path) describes as follows: 

On the point of happiness as a 'slippery notion', I think there's a very helpful distinction to make between hedonic and eudaemonic happiness. Roughly speaking (and this is just my take - I welcome refinements or corrections): through the first 2 noble truths, a Buddhist practitioner stops seeking ultimate refuge in hedonic happiness, turning away from the sorrow and disappointment that inevitably follow from putting all of one's eggs in this basket; and through the 3rd and 4th noble truths a practitioner begins to perfect his or her eudaemonic happiness. As to how successful Buddhist practitioners are in this endeavor as a whole... honestly, it's a fascinating question but I have no idea how to answer it empirically on a large scale. For myself and the practitioners I've met, simply turning toward eudaemonic happiness has been a profound and lasting source of joy - a path good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good at the end. 

Right view has a very important role in that unfolding. One's very definition of "Noble" or "wisdom" reflects one's view, and in fact it seems that inquiry into and transformation of view is integral to how and where one travels as a sentient being. As Bhikkhu Bodhi writes in the same book: 

Not being around fools Being around the wise Remembering the honorable Having one‘s abode in a suitable place for safe practice Having done meritorious actions The pursuit of higher understanding Being rich in knowledge Being rich in skill to be highly restrained ethically Using only well-spoken words Supporting one's parents Caring for the family Unconfused actions Generosity Right living Caring for one‘s relatives Refraining from unskillful things To abhor unwholeseome things To avoid unwholesome things To avoid intoxicants Diligence in righteousness Reverence Humility Contentment Gratitude Hearing the Dhamma at the right time Patience Compliance Seeing the monks Discussing the Dhamma Self-restraint A holy life Seeing The Four Noble Truths Realizing Nibbana A heart not trembling, unshaken A heart not trembling, sorrowless A heart not trembling, stainless A heart not trembling, secure (from Khuddaka Nikaya, Sutta Nipata 2.4) 

King Asoka liked the Dhamma so much that he lavished the monks with robes, food and medicine... This attracted many fake monks... Monks were beheaded in an effort to find the imposters but that didn't work. They started the third council to purify the monastic order by questioning monks to find out who knew the Dhamma and who held heretical views so they could expell the real imposters from the Sangha. 

What is the Pali/Sanskrit term(s) for 'intelligence'? Is there another word(s) in Pali/Sanskrit for 'wisdom'? I hear 'intellect', 'intelligence' and 'wisdom' used interchangeably, is this correct? What is the relationship between intelligence and wisdom in Buddhism? Are they really the same thing or can they be the same thing or what? :) 

What are some signs that one might be seeing the three characteristics with more clarity or depth? What might represent that one is having a new and more profound experience of impermanence, dukkha or not-self during one's practice or during any time? Here are some examples of what is meant by sign: 

That's how consciousness is, one by one the consciousness comes and goes but there is no self or body when you look this closely moment by moment. 

It depends more on what each teacher teaches & less on what the religion of the teacher is. It depends more on the students ability to teach themselves the important details that even the best teachers cannot teach. According to the Tipitaka, if a non-Buddhist teacher teaches something similar to the Eightfold Path then the better the chance that the teacher's students will become arahants. 

I have no idea what Udana Nikaya (VIII: 3) is. I wish we have something like biblehub for buddhism. Let me translate that to English. Know Bhikkus, Something is not born, something doesn't manifest, something isn't created, something is absolute. Hi Bhikkus, if nothing is not unborn, not manifested, not created, not absolute, then we cannot be free from birth, manifestation (or incaranation/reincarnation), forming, and resulting out of previous causes. But Bhikkus, because something is not born, not manifested, not created, not resulting from previous cause, then there is a possibility to be free from birth, manifestation, forming, and resulting from previous causes. Any Indonesian can say that my translation is about right. Am I? 

$URL$ In Indonesia, due to muslim influence, believes in an "Esa" God is one of the founding principle of Indonesians. The words "Esa" in Indonesia can mean many things. Some says it means one (as in islam), or united (as in christianity) or comprehensive (according to my hindu friends). It seems that whoever wrote "Ketuhanan yang maha esa" wants to unite Indonesians under some open to interpretation terms. The buddhists in Indonesia then have this concept of Sang Hyang Adi Buddha which they called is "God" Is it? What is it? Is it God? I thought God is more like Bakka Brahma in Buddha. Is this just Indonesian thingy or is it common among buddha? In that wikipedia article I found a strange paragraph 

Parents of buddha pamper sidartha with women even when he was a child. Such act would be considered child abuse in western world though most males would think, "nice" There are some characters that are obviously fictional. 

Ozamu Tetzuka wrote a comic about Buddha. I read that and is quite impressed. However, some of the element may not be true. And based on what I read, I tell some stories in it, and my friends are offended. Some of the elements: 

Buddha says that he hears some god having foolish thought. I think it's the story of Bakka Brahma. He "transfer" himself to the god's presence and lectures. And his disciples too. That seems like long distance communication. That seems to be well within the realm of science. Now anyone test this? Get a buddha, or a bodhisatva (buddha had many disciples, each can show up on Bakka Brahma tools). Ask them for one number and let the other guesses. Would it works? 

It's not manditory but if we plan on living in a world with mandatory attatchments we certainly need to know how to practice in the world so we can learn how to let go of those mandatory attatchments. Attatchment certainly isn't mandatory but maybe I'm not getting what you mean. Silence isn't needed with vipassana(ok, ok, I mean with the kind of vipassana I practice). Silence is only very necessary for concentration practices. In The Mahasi Vipassana Method I was taught, we are not trying to get to any special state of mind but only whatever comes up in awareness. It's so simple I thought there had to be more to it but there wasn't and I wasted a lot of time trying to complicate the teaching. So, I had a problem, did I need to go to a monestary? No. I had to find a good teacher. If we plan on living in a monestary we certainly need to know how to practice in a monestary. Monestaries are great because everyone is on the same page and there are usually good teachers but the same could be said about a meditation center down in the middle of the city, were there are probably some good lay teachers and good monastic teachers. 

...when I die, "I" (body, illusory self, soul) will die but this informational flow will keep going into another being, and then I no longer exist, think, feel or I will be different being, so this being will be living but not me, then why should I care about his life if I will no longer exist? We die many times in a second as the "informational" flow keeps going into another being. We are not the same being we were a fraction of a second ago. That being has died. Do you see how experience goes on and on, moment by moment? We are always changing, moment by moment. We are always dying, moment by moment. It's the same thing. When the physical body dies, that is just another change. After that body dies we will see how experience goes on and on, moment by moment. We don't really need to worry about nirvana as long as we are continuously practicing although we should care about nirvana as far as nirvana is Dhamma, if we care about our own freedom from suffering.
