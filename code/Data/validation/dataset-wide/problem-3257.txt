From what I have observed professional Historians seek to create a narrative that explain specific events that are recorded. For instance one of my professor's looks at the social status females Jews in Perugia during the Middle Ages. She is seeking to tell a story that represents them, their beliefs and views. Also she looks at what external factors shape their world, like geography, climates but also how Christianity would have influenced their lives. Many historians understand that the discipline of history is purely speculative, nothing definitively happened, because the past theoretically does not exist. Historian look at primary sources, and secondary sources and try to answer different questions, new questions, and even propose new claims, about what might have happened. The Essential Historiography Reader by Caroline Hoefferle, and Why bother with History? Ancient, Modern and Postmodern Motivations by Beverly Southgate are both excellent sources that I highly recommend to any one looking to ask the bigger questions about history. 

I would not qualify Stalin's education as "some college". According to his biography he never attended an analog of modern primary or secondary school. I translate from Russian Wikipedia: In 1886 his mother tried to enroll him to Orthodox religious school. He was not accepted because he did not know Russian at all (education was in Russian) In 1886-7 on request of his mother the children of a local priest taught him some Russian. As a result he was able to enroll in 1888 to the first preparatory class. He studied in this school from 1889 to 1894 and then was enrolled to an Orthodox seminary. There he studied 4 years and was expelled. We have 9 years total of religious education (preparation to become a priest). 

The most common approach to class, especially class conflict in the, is a Marxist approach. Marx took a cyclic view of history from Hegelian "thesis antithesis." he ultimately viewed the synthesis of the thesis, bourgeois, and the antithesis, proletariat, in to a Marxist communist state. Postmodernist are also extremely class conscious, dealing with Deconstructionist and Poststructuralist movements.The most prominent Historian to come out of this was Foucault. The new left, although not as theoretical, was still highly class conscious. This era of historians came out of the Vietnam conflict and the Cold War. The new left was critical of class interests, but also social and diplomatic interests. 

Most likely they did not know how to count, except for the very basics, such as counting on their fingers and adding up small values. In the middle ages mathematics had a heavy foundation in arithmetic, and therefore the Ph.D. in Mathematics would be roughly equivalent to a third grader's homework today. Since academics and education did not have a emphasis in the middle ages, most people would not have explored number theory (even a most "primitive" case of coming up with zero). The monks, aristocracy and other educated people would have used the clumsy Roman Numeral system. Most common people were illiterate so they did not write down numbers, and did not understand numbers or number systems. 

I suppose you are asking of the major technological advances in Europe. (If otherwise, perhaps the the most important inventions were made in China, gunpowder, for example. Paper was invented before the fall of the Roman empire.) In Europe, the two most important technological advances in the Medieval time were eyeglasses (1286) and mechanical clocks (1176). Of course, this is a very long period between the fall of the Roman empire and these inventions. But I suppose that no MAJOR technological advances were made during this period: this was a period of general decline (in Europe and in the Middle east) if not a complete collapse of civilization. 

When Dido, the founder of Carthage arrived to the place, she purchased land from the Berber king Iarbas. Berbers kingdoms pre-date the founding of Carthage. Of course there were also other states in North Africa, see the comment of Semaphore. How "primitive" they were is a question of opinion. 

In the period 1940-1941 the United States was technically neutral but was already involved in the war on England's side. The US Navy was escorting convoys, delivering Lend-Lease shipments of armaments and food to England and suffering losses in the North Atlantic. The destroyer Reuben James was sunk by torpedo in March 1941. Hitler recognized all this in his speech to the Reichstag on December 11 1941, explaining his reasons for a declaration of war on the US. A video of Hitler's speech and reasons for declaring war on the US can be seen on Youtube. 

Germans and British combatants frequently visited Ireland which was neutral in WWII. German submarine crews would frequent pubs in Dublin as did RAF pilots and crews of British Navy vessels. Sometimes there would be knowing encounters of Germans and British; sometimes unknowing encounters; sometimes just vague suspicions that the bunch of square-heads sitting at the bar were German submariners. This wasn't the proper venue for violence so visiting belligerents either avoided each other or talked shop with each other. Under Article 17 of the Hague Convention belligerent vessels or aircraft requiring repairs or with sick, wounded or dead crewmen on board could stay in neutral ports for a period of 72 hours. After that time internment of ship and crew would occur. To avoid internment, belligerent ships and aircraft had to leave the neutral country after the prescribed time had elapsed. Ireland has a long history of allowing aircraft of belligerent nations to overfly Irish territory or to refuel at Shannon. The prerequisites were: no weapons, no armaments on board, no explosives. Allied pilots frequently landed in Ireland or crash-landed, refueled or hospitalized and were then escorted to the border with Northern Ireland. Crews of German aircraft had to prove they were not on a 'combative mission' which was a hard test for them, but not impossible. I should note here that ROI neutrality was never a statutory matter of law. It was a policy of the government then in power. So internment or no internment was decided on an ad hoc basis. 

These years are typically referred to Newton's "Golden years" due to the quantity and quality of his works during those years. Newton's Mother and Uncle managed the farm through out Newton's life. During the plague his family would have taken care of him, like provide him food clothing and shelter. His family knew that he was an "absent minded farmer" which is why his uncle initially sent him to Cambridge to study. 

Peasants did not participate in the first crusade, at least in the way that this question is implying. Pope Urban II called for the noblemen or knights to go and recapture the "Holy Land." In exchange for their service, the Pope granted a "plenary pardon" to all those who participated in the crusades. Peasants began to participate in the later crusades because they wanted the Pope's pardon as well. When hoards of peasants began to trek over to Jerusalem, wreaking havoc in their wake, the Pope began to grant the pardon to people who would help sponsor a crusade, in an effort to keep peasants from crusading themselves. Peasants during the first crusade would be apart of a knights entourage. These people were extremely poor, and wore a blouse and britches. When these clothes wore out, they would keep wearing them, because it was all they had. 

Many of the descendants of the Mongol empire (except China, Mongolia and Far East). It is true that they were conquered by the Mongols, but at that time Mongols were not Muslims. At a later period some descendants of Mongols converted to Islam, in fact they accepted the religion of one of the conquered nations, and the result is that their contemporary descendants are Muslims. This includes Tatars, for example, and several peoples of North Caucasus region (Chechnya, for example). Modern Tatars and Chechens are mostly Muslim. They are descendants of the state which was called Ulus Joshi, or later the Golden Horde, whose Mongolian rulers converted to Islam (Uzbeg khan, in 1313) and eventually made Islam the dominant religion without being conquered by an Islamic state. Eventually this Golden Horde dissolved into pieces and most pieces were conquered by the Christian Moscovia. But their population remained mainly Muslim and remains to this day. Modern Mongolia has only 3% Muslims, according to Wikipedia. 

There is a 1-room American Lend-Lease Museum located in school #1262 6 Zhitnaya Street in Moscow which hardly anyone ever visits. The exhibits include all manner of Lend-Lease items--a jeep, several motorcycles, a pack of Lucky Strike cigarettes (green); canteens, compasses, uniform clothing, canned food, etc. and a wall display of photos depicting Lend-Lease events during the war. A proper museum would include samples of the Sherman tanks, locomotives, artillery, trucks and combat aircraft that were delivered to the USSR in the tens of thousands. The museum is difficult to visit since school is in session.The museum is said to be established by lend-lease enthusiasts in Russia. The Russian government has made a concerted effort to downplay America's role in the Russian victory over fascism. During the war, whenever a Russian Sherman tank battalion liberated a city, Stalin forbade victory parades which would reveal the massive Allied contribution to Russian victories. Most of the military hardware was shipped via The Persian Corridor (see Wikipedia for details).Combat aircraft were flown from Alaska to Siberian airfields by Russian air and ground crews who received training in Alaska.
