Thread or knurl the stays so there's more friction with the black plastic clamps. If that's not enough, do you ever remove the fenders/mudguards? Two small metal jubilee clips should provide more compression around the stays. An extreme solution would be to apply threadlocker or superglue inside the clamp. You seem to have enough room between the mudguard and the tyre. What if you bent the stays upward to 90degrees, so the plastic clamps rotated on their screws and pointed almost straight down? Another option is that guard extension looks like rigid plastic - Some bikes have a 100-150mm (4-6 inch) piece of leather as a mudflap right at the bottom. The added damping might help, and will help protect the drivechain and BB. Last resort is to replace the two sliders and clamps with a single straightened coathanger. This would be a two-leg U shape such that the stay passes around the outside of the guard, with a retaining saddle clamp, and then back to the fork on both sides. That way it can't possibly slip back. In fact I'd probably just do this and not bother with the other solutions. 

Resetting the trip meter is on page 27 of the manual. Problem with this is its the bike's odometer, not a trip meter for each ride. So by resetting this you have no idea how far your bike has gone in its life. This is valuable information for servicing intervals. It would be like clearing the odometer for a car. 

Its your call - depends on how you ride. I've replaced at least 15 spokes in a 26" MTB wheel, but always one or two at a time and I still ride that wheel today. If you were a racer with fewer spokes on the wheel, then absolutely a new rim. Since its a city bike, much less of a problem should it degrade. Wheel repairs are reasonably easy, but take time and bike tools and the knack to true the wheel. 

None of them will be "right" Strava may throw away your elevation data depending on the device used to record it. So for any phone-based app the height is ignored, and your track is placed on a map, then the known elevation is read off that. For devices with known-good barometric sensors (Garmins and some others) the data in the upload IS used by strava. 

Good luck - there's a very high probability noone noted the serial number, or registered it anywhere that you can search. Giant themselves might be able to tell you what shop sold it, but whether they kept records or not, who knows. Your other option is to report it to the local police station as "found property" and after a month if the owner doesn't claim it then its yours legally. We scored a nice tent that way that blew into our yard once, fully assembled but never pegged to the ground. You can assume its probably not repainted, so is a Blue bike from new. I'd agree with your reading of the digits. Possibly the first character is a C or a Q or maybe an O, but the rest look exactly right. G for Giant might make a lot of sense too. 

Links There are people who have gone the other way, and wrapped an enclosure around a bike rather than stripping a car down to find the bike inside. The PodRide weighs 70 kilograms, and is a cloth and tube frame around a recumbent-style frame. 

A dirty hack is to use a hammer and drift, but it will marr the impact point on the lock ring. You can use an old/rubbish flat screwdriver as a drift too, by putting the end into the corner on a notch. Second option is to use a sliding lockjaw pliers around the whole lockring, because its wider than the BB you'll be able to get a grip. Marring the metal can still happen, so layers of cloth can help protect it. Buying the right tool is an option, but depends if you're going to get value out of it. Finally, consider replacing the entire BB with a modern cartridge bearing housing. That will use a common BB removal tool without a lockring. This way you can bang off the old one without worrying about refitting it. This will require different cranks too, your old cottered cranks won't fit. 

Separate answer - noone has mentioned Lock-out your suspension Mountain bikes may be front suspension (ie a fork that retracts) or full suspension (a rear wheel bouncing system as well as front suspension) When riding on the flat sealed smooth road, suspension saps your power by transforming Push into Bounce. You don't need suspension on the road, not at all. Some MTBs feature a lockout where you can turn a knob or lever to disable the suspension. Rear suspension can normally be hardened by screwin a disk along a threadded rod. The details depend on the bike. 

From $URL$ Bicycles Please fold down the handlebars, remove the pedals, take the air out of the wheels and pack it in one of the special boxes we will provide you with. Carriage requirements Single-seat and no motor. It must be checked-in folded, with the handlebars against the sides, the pedals removed, the wheels with the air taken out and correctly packed. Iberia has a packing container measuring 131+72+21 cm in many airports. The price of this container is 20 Euros per unit. This container will be issued at the customer's request or at the requirement of the agents in cases of irregularities (except, e.g., in Berlin and Dusseldorf airports). If the bicycle being checked in is bigger than the container provided by IBERIA, the passenger will be responsible for finding another one that is the right size. Iberia reserves the right to reject bulky sporting equipment and to pass it to Iberia Cargo with conditions and tariffs that are different from those indicated above. Allowance For long-haul flights (America, Asia and South Africa), it is considered an item that can be carried within the passenger's allowance. If you add other items, exceeding the permitted number of free items, it will be considered excess baggage. For short-haul and medium-haul flights, a single fee of 45 Euro applies, regardless of the luggage allowance. The maximum weight allowed shall be 23 kg with an overweight fee for weights of up to 32 kg. The fee must be paid at the airport. 

Sounds like the low stop on the rear derailleur is not quite correct, and the RD needs to move a very small amount to the left. If you're mechanically inclined this is straightforward. Suspend the bike from a workstand, or hang it so that the rear wheel is free to rotate and the pedals won't strike anything. 

Its a Schwinn Lowrider with what looks to be 16" high-spoke count wheels. It is not a limo lowrider or stingray lowrider, just a "lowrider" The front springer fork (suspension) and high spoke count, and banana seat have been part of the design for a long time. As for year - the model was available from the 1960s and is still available now. Lack of front brake implies its not recent, or its from somewhere that a single brake is legal. Note, the rearward seating position makes this a "semi crank-forward" bike, and it would be quite hard to ride up a decent grade because it would be tippy and light on the front wheel.
