I once had an initial phone interview with a company that started off with "What is your salary expectation". I came back with a figure that was mid range for the type of job, my experience and the location. The interviewer replied that that was too much and said they would only pay mid-range minus about $15K and that there was no point continuing with the interview. That company has had a lot of ads over the years for very similar positions and seems to be chasing unicorns. 

Shows the advantages of drop box over all other potential solutions Shows how you can mitigate/eliminate the issues raised by your boss 

The agreement was only for a week1, and you had no time to prepare for a longer period. (Packing for a week can be different to packing for 3 weeks depending on your situation). You believe that you can achieve the work from your home location. You have personal reasons for not extending your stay in the US. 

This acknowledges that company C may of had issues with X, Y and Z, but more importantly directs the conversation into a forward looking direction rather than dwelling in the past. Hopefully you already know that this new company embraces X, Y and Z, and if not you now get a chance to see how your interviewers respond to your desires. 

On a more personal level of advice. Try and identify why you feel bad about being where you are right now. Is there anything that can mitigate these feelings? For example is it stress from being in a foreign country you are not familiar with? Is it having to choose between staying in a hotel room and your office, with no real relaxation? Is it to with having no time to consider the choices you had make? You are entitled to have any/all of those feelings plus any other ones that you have. But that does not mean there are approaches you could take that to help minimize them. And your company obviously believes in your technical skills and gave you huge a vote of confidence when they felt that you could instantly jump on a plane and come to the US to do your work. That is something that you should keep in mind. 

That's all you have to say. And when the interviewers ask you what sort of place would be a good fit for you, you can reply with: 

These are all valid points to put to your CEO. Point #2 is the only one that requires justification. For that you need to come up with a reasonable plan as to how you will do remote support and present it as definite solution. This will include how you will handle time zone differences etc. Points #1 and #3 are valid as they stand and it could be a bad sign if your company ignores your personal position on them as it could indicate they want to abuse you by bullying you into staying. However a reasonable company understands that keeping you happy as a worker is a long term benefit to the company and they should not ignore your personal feelings. At this point it becomes a negotiation between how you feel and what your CEO will offer you for compensation to put up with you feelings. Right now you have the power to board your flight as booked and go home with the possible consequences of losing your job (but I don't know about your labor laws). But if you do that then your company will suffer the loss of your projects and will have to find someone else to do the work so it becomes a lose/lose situation. Nobody wants that, so you need to strive for a win/win situation On the other hand your director seems more aware of your feelings and how this proposed change will impact you. So if you feel so strongly that you have to return home, and can present it as a reasonable case then I don't think that it is a career ending move. Finally, are you legally working in the US? Even if this company has an office in the US you can't just arrive and work without the correct visa. The comment below from Patricia is a good point. If you are working illegally then you are being asked to break the law as a part of your job. It is possible to get away with this, but visa infractions can have long term consequences if you get kicked out of the country. 

My opinion is that you need to separate yourself from this person ASAP. Your employer's comment about the payroll company figuring out what to deduct sounds like pure BS as they need all the details that you haven't yet provided in order to officially make those deductions. The comment about paying back the taxes from your first pay check also sound like BS as well. If he has a payroll company doing his wages then why does he need to figure out what the deductions are? The silver lining to quitting ASAP is that he will have a hard time proving that you need to pay him back for anything he claims you owe him - and he can't follow through with any legal action he will threaten you with because that will expose his fraudulent practices. I suggest you run to your local labor board and tell them exactly what is happening and how you are being treated. You do not need to go to a lawyer on your own accord. 

Windows 7 and Windows 10 desktop systems as well as Windows Servers. SQL databases and in particular MS SQL server (of various types) Networking IP cameras Various 3rd party software packages and how they install and interact in Windows. Custom programming (C#/WPF for me) Etc etc. 

And another possibility The company is cheap and doesn't want to pay a reasonable renumeration for the position, and the potential applicants know this - resulting in an unfilled vacancy for a long time. 

Unless you have a true BYOD policy then your desires really have no leverage here. And going against the flow will cause some friction. But I am confused as both of your options end up with you using windows. So why not just go with the easiest option of a company supplied laptop? I say this as someone who is writing this on a Mac Book Pro and has a client supplied Windows 10 based machine next to me, a different client's windows 7 based system behind that one and my own Windows 7 desktop to the other side of me and about 10 different Windows virtual machines tucked away on my Mac's hard drive. My experience is that in general you get the best Windows user experience (as you can have) running Windows directly on the hardware it's designed for than running it on Mac System via any sort of virtualized system. 

NOTE That I have gone with the common idea that people in CS do programming and deal with IT issues. I know that technically this may not bet he case; and that designing languages and building compilers might be a better description of what a pure CS degree includes.
