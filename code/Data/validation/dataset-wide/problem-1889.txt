Directors don't like extra work. You should have a bug reporting mechanism. If the bug is not reported you cannot address the bug. You should have test procedures and test dates. Provide that to the director. I would not confront the person but remind them of the bug reporting mechanism and tell them they can come to you if they have any problems. 

Get a lawyer to review it. I have seen them enforced and the company has bigger pockets than you. My father lost one and the overlap between the two companies was very very small. 

It is not reasonable to secure a campus of cell phone nor restrict an employee from a cell phone at their desk. If the data is that confidential then the data should be restricted to a clean room void of printers and USB devices. Restricted access and no recording devices. If data is available on the general campus then restricting cell phones is not going to protect data if someone wants to copy it. As for the direct question "how to implement it?". If it is block cell phones on the campus then don't. Tell the customer that block cell phone on the entire campus is not readily enforceable and puts an undue burden on employees. Don't add it does not really secure the data. Propose another reasonable security policy and practice. Or if you have a reasonable security policy and practice in place currently then just report the existing. 

Uh, that is not an omission that is a lie. If he said the system were implemented (at length) but they are not that is a lie. I don't think you are going to get very far with this person to renegotiate. Someone that lied in the interview did not even negotiate in good faith the first time. That said it seems like you have to give it a try. "Based on what I have seen with the current state of systems I just don't see how I can make what I expected to make when I signed up for this salary / commission structure." If he does not react in a positive manner then just shut the conversation down. Look for another job. Don't push it as you might get pushed to the curb. As for leaving - 2 months is probably better than 12. At 2 months it was not a good fit and at 12 you could not make it fit. If this is a big company the word is probably out with a lot of other hiring managers. If they ask I would consider being honest. 

To be offered a position for next year is compliment. What you have to consider is they may be on a deadline to offer internships to schools and are willing to allocate a spot to you up front. It is not rude to ask for an extension but I have to ask why you need a week? What is going to change in a week? It is not like you have other offers to consider. As the company I would be thinking if he needs a week to decide then he is not excited about the opportunity. We are excited enough about this guy to offer him a position next year and he is clearly not as excited about us. Let's say you have been dating a girl for the summer and need to back to school and 2 weeks before you go back you ask her if you can make plans for your first break from school - Thanks Giving. If she said I need a week to think about it would not be rude. But it is clear she does not consider you a keeper. You are sending the message you clearly are not excited about the company. 

I have been in this situation a bit as a computer person working in the field for non computing companies. It is typically better to have a higher level person that sees the big picture as your line manger. I was managed centrally as part of a skill pool. I kind of got shafted as I did not have someone that saw me day to day to argue my worth when it came ranking and rating. I did not ask for this but they decided to have distributed staff rated and ranked within the functional manager and across the board we got screwed. It was forced ranking and they wanted their engineers to get the best ratings and we were disposable to them. So it went back to central rating and ranking the next year and they agree to ignore a low ranking if you had a higher on either side. But when I came back after three distributed assignments it worked way better for me with a breadth of experience even if I took some minor hits in ranking. The point is managing you as an asset and managing your day to day tasks are different and some times best to be managed by different people. 

Yes there is precedent. I have seen people marched out the door in a firing or layoff and asked to provide a list. I worked for a company that went under and gave 3 days notice. The place got ransacked. If everything is not returned then file with the state employment commission. And file for unemployment ASAP. 

Lot of good answers that are all no. And I agree 90% of the time. Here is where it might help you. They know the weakness of the competitors and will tell you. It is something you can check out for yourself. They may be more for good reason. Some times it is a competitor they want to shut out and will match the price. 

On the form you can select Do NOT reveal my name to my Employer. form One possible outcome is the business shutting down if they don't have the funds to correct critical safety violation(s). OSHA is not going to give them much slack based on cannot afford it. If it is just a ladder and drinking fountain that is not much. It would be cheaper for them to fix it than shut down. If you try and fix the problem directly and it fails they could blame you for the problem. Your are in a bad spot. It is not safe. You have a choice of working in a unsafe environment or risk the the company having to shut down. If you are severely hurt you children are not going eat. 

Come on it is not a reasonable expectation that you can just flop from car to cash. Cannot return it until the lease is up is very reasonable to me. I would assert the onus was on you to ask about car policy at the time you requested the car. I would say use of a car during maternity leave is nice perk. I think you are getting greedy wanting cash as that is better for you during maternity leave. Would it be your intention to go back to a car once maternity leave is over? I worked for company were you got a small flat allowance and nice per mile. Or a nice flat allowance and and small per mile. We had to pick one and stay with it. Seemed pretty fair to me. 

Decline the job offer? You don't have a job offer. Why would you continue to interview for a possible job offer if you don't plan on accepting. They told you one more interview will be taken. Simply decline the the interview. "Sorry I decided not to pursue this opportunity." 

I get you are in a tough spot but you need to consider your career over near term employment. Worst case scenario is you and the company are caught and you have fraud charges on you criminal record. And it would likely be federal charges. That would immediately show up on any background check. Just by asking they put themselves at risk. I would be concerned about repercussions but they have more to lose than you. Do you have proof they asked you to commit fraud? 

I assume a manager approved and purchasing bought. Multiple parties did not foresee this problem. If he is going to blame you for this then not much you can do. I don't think you should apologize for your actions. I don't think I would use the word "sorry" as in sorry for what you did. You can say sorry for the outcome. I would prefer the word outcome over consequence. Consequence might imply the lunch box caused this. 

It is a matter of culture. If you understand quality but the company does not then you will not get rewarded. Treat it like game with a glitch and exploit the glitch. Produce what they want not what is valuable. Yes by all means ask for the tasks they reward. Work within your area of influence not your area of concern. As you move up your area of influence will increase. 

The problem with 1 is that is they will have no urgency. They will feel like they have 30 days. You almost need to resign or tell them you have a hard job offer you are considering to get a quick response. And you need to consider they may need to take in another investor and you will get diluted. Go in at the high end and be ready to take job offer. Or go in at 4% and you will not be diluted. Any investor money needs to come out of founders share. Given you have 3 investors with 80% and one at 10% now way they are going to give more than 6% unless you are absolutely critical to the company. Immediate vesting at 4% is still more than double what you have. And I don't think that would come off as a threat. If 6% would probably not come off as a treat but most likely a no.
