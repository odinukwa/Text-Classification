Problems in Group Theory, by John Dixon. I worked through a good deal of this as an undergrad, and learned a lot from it. 

This conjecture is false. It has to be, because it is asymtotically wrong: The number of plane partitions of size $n$ grows like $\exp(n^{2/3- \epsilon})$ and the number of triples of partitions of $n$ (with no condition on them) grows like only $\exp(n^{1/2+\epsilon})$. (citation) As I'll explain below, there is a relationship between the two sides. Using that relationship, I can predict that the result will fail for $n=13$, $k=3$. I don't know if this is the first failure. 

The original questioner already knows this, but anyone else who is interested in this question should check out the conversation at John Baez's blog. 

Here is a geometric description in the case of $H_n(\mathbb{C}^2)$. This is meant to be a geometric rewrite of Proposition 2.6 in Mark Haiman's "(t,q)-Catalan numbers and the Hilbert scheme", Discrete Math. 193 (1998), 201-224. Let $S= (\mathbb{C}^2)^n/S_n$; notice that this is an orbifold. Let $S_0$ be the open dense set where the $n$ points are distinct. For $D$ an $n$-element subset of $\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}^2$, let $A_{D}$ be the polynomial $\det( x_i^{a} y_i^{b})$, where $(a, b)$ ranges over the elements of $D$ and $i$ runs from $1$ to $n$. For any $D$ and $D'$, the ratio $A_D/A_{D'}$ is a meromorphic function on $S$, and is well defined on $S_0$. Map $S_0$ into $S_0 \times \mathbb{CP}^{\infty}$ where the homogenous coordinates on $ \mathbb{CP}^{\infty}$ are the $A_{D}$'s. (Only finitely many of the $A_D$'s are needed, but it would be a little time consuming to say which ones.) The Hilbert scheme is the closure of $S_0$ in $S \times \mathbb{CP}^{\infty}$. Algebraically, we can describe this as the blow up of $S$ along the ideal generated by all products $A_D A_{D'}$. Haiman points out that the reduction of this ideal is the locus where two of the points collide and speculates that this ideal may be reduced. If his speculation is correct, then we can describe $H_n(\mathbb{C}^2)$ geometrically as the blow up of $(\mathbb{C}^2)^n/S_n$ along the reduced locus where at least two of the points are equal. 

If you can get that, let $G$ be the graph where there is an edge $(u,v)$ if $<_1$ and $<_2$ give the same relation between $u$ and $v$. You want to prove that the first alternative in the alternate Ramsey theorem applies. Assume, for contradiction, that there is an infinite $Y$ such that, for $u$ and $v$ in $Y$, the inequality $u <_1 v$ implies $u >_2 v$. Then $Y$ is well ordered by $<_1$. Let $z$ be the $<_1$ smallest element of $Y$ such that $\{ y \in Y, \ y <_1 z\}$ is infinite. You should be able to give a combinatorial proof that $<_1$ restricted to $\{ y \in Y, \ y <_1 z\}$ is $\omega$. Then $<_2$ restricted to $\{ y \in Y, \ y <_1 z\}$ is not well ordered, a contradiction. 

There is a discussion of this issue at the $n$-category cafe. I'd encourage people who were interested in this question to head over there and see if they can lend some insight. 

Here is a good way to think of the standard proof: Let $L/K$ be a cyclic extension of degree $n$, with $\sigma$ a generator of $Gal(L/K)$. Suppose that $N(a)=1$, for $a \in L$. Define the operator $\tau: L \to L$ by $\tau(b) = a \sigma(b)$. We have $$\tau^n(b) = a \sigma(a) \sigma^2(a) \cdots \sigma^{n-1}(a) b = N(a) b =b$$ so $\tau^n$ is the identity. Also, $\tau$ is $K$-linear. So, considering $L$ as a $K$-vector space, we have a representation of $\mathbb{Z}/n$ on $L$. We want to show that this representation has a trivial summand. If we can show this, we are done; if $\tau(c) = c$ for $c \neq 0$ then $a = c/\sigma(c)$. As you will learn in any course on representation theory, the operator $$\pi := (1/n) \left( 1+ \tau + \cdots + \tau^{n-1} \right)$$ is the projector onto the trivial summand of $L$. The standard proof is to verify that $\pi$ is nonzero. 

The only hard part to check is that $(u+v)^{p-1} (du+dv)$ is equivalent to $u^{p-1} du+ v^{p-1} dv$ modulo $B^1$. To this end, note that $$(u+v)^{p-1} (du+dv) - u^{p-1} du - v^{p-1} dv = d \sum_{k=1}^{p-1} \frac{1}{p} \binom{p}{k} d(u^k v^{p-k}). \quad (\ast)$$ Here $\frac{1}{p} \binom{p}{k}$ must be interpreted as an integer which we reduce modulo $p$ to make an element of $k$. (Morally, equation $(\ast)$ comes from the relation $d(u+v)^p = \sum_{k=0}^{p} \binom{p}{k} d(u^k v^{p-k})$. We can't deduce $(\ast)$ directly from this because we can't divide by $p$, but $(\ast)$ is still true in characteristic $p$.) If $A$ has a sufficiently nice deformation $\tilde{A}$ over the ring of Witt vectors $W(k)$, and $F: \tilde{A} \to \tilde{A}$ is a lift of Frobenius, then $\cF$ for $\omega \in \Omega^r$ is given by reduction modulo $p$ of $\frac{1}{p^r} (F^{\ast})^r \omega$. I don't know exactly what "sufficiently nice" means, but $\tilde{A}$ smooth over $W(k)$ is certainly enough. This is my favorite way to think of $\cF$. $\cF$ respects localization, and thus makes sense on schemes. It also respects etale extension and completion, for those who prefer other topologies. We now have Theorem I.3.4 in Brion and Kumar (presumably not original, but they don't cite it): If $A$ is regular, than $\cF$ is an isomorphism $\Omega^{\bullet} \to H^{\bullet}$. Proof sketch: The claim is that a map of finitely generated $A^p$ modules is an isomorphism; this can be checked on completions. So we are reduced to proving the claim in a power series algebra. This is a combinatorial exercise, very similar to the proof of the Poincare lemma for formal power series in characteristic zero. Note that this is interesting even for $r=0$: It says that $df=0$ for $f \in A$ if and only if $f$ is a $p$-th power. For $A$ regular, the Cartier operator $\cC: H^{\bullet} \to \Omega^{\bullet}$ is the inverse to $\cF$. In particular, if $A$ regular of dimension $1$, then we can take the composition $\Omega^1 \to H^1 \to \Omega^1$ to get the definition you gave. $\cC$ on a curve is analogous to residue in several senses: 

Here is a bad algorithm, just to show that this is computationally doable. I don't know what a good algorithm would look like. Step 1: Isolate the $\chi$ component of the group ring Let $\mathbb{C}[G]$ be the group algebra and $\chi$ the character. Define $\pi = 1/|G| \sum \chi(g) g \in \mathbb{C}[G]$. Observe that $\pi$ is a central idempotent. Set $A=\pi \mathbb{C}[G] \pi$. So $A$ is a finite dimensional $\mathbb{C}$ algebra. We could calculate a basis for $A$ by starting with the spanning set $\{ \pi g \pi \}_{g \in G}$ and discarding duplicates, and we could work out how to multiply in that basis. Now, from representation theoretic nonsense, we know that $A \cong \mathrm{End}(V)$ where $V$ is the representation we are looking for. Specifically, $\pi g \pi$ corresponds to the matrix in $\mathrm{End}(V)$ by which $g$ acts on $V$. If we could compute this isomorphism, we'd be in great shape. Step 2: Find an isomorphism with a ring of matrices Choose $X$ a generic element of $A$. Computationally, just choose a random linear combination $\sum t(g) \pi g \pi$. Unless you got unlucky with your choice, $X$ with have distinct eigenvalues when acting on $V$. We will use the eigenvectors for those eigenvalues as a canonical basis for $V$ to write down our representation. Let $d = \dim V$. Form the powers $1$, $X$, $X^2$, ... $X^d$ and, using basic linear algebra, find the polynomial $\sum a_i X^i=0$ they obey. Since $A$ is isomorphic to the $d \times d$ matrices, such a polynomial will exist. Now, at this point I am going to assume that you have a computer algebra system good enough to work with the roots of an arbitrary complex polynomial. I suspect this might be a problem in practice. Let $\lambda_1$, $\lambda_2$, ..., $\lambda_d$ be these roots. Let $P_i(t)$ be the polynomial $\prod_{j \neq i} (t-\lambda_j)/\prod_{j \neq i} (\lambda_i-\lambda_j)$. So $P_i(\lambda_j)=\delta_{ij}$. Set $\pi_i=P_i(X)$. So the $\pi_i$ are commuting orthogonal idempotents in $A$. Let $e_{ij}$ be the element of $A$ with $\pi_i e_{ij} = e_{ij} \pi_j = e_{ij}$. The element $e_{ij}$ is unique up to scalar factor, and can be found by linear algebra. Once you get these scalar factors right, which I'll gloss over, you have constructed the isomorphism $A \cong \mathrm{End}(V)$. Step 3: Profit! Write $\pi g \pi$ in the $e_{ij}$ basis. This is, in coordinates, the action of $g$ on $V$. 

Let $X$ and $Z$ be smooth manifolds and $\phi: X \to Z$ a smooth map so that the differential $D \phi$ is everywhere of rank $d$. Is there necessarily a $d$-fold $Y$ so that $\phi$ factors as a submersion $X \to Y$ followed by an immersion $Y \to Z$? I have no real motivation, it just seemed like a natural question. Notice that we can't assume $Y \to Z$ is injective: Consider mapping $\mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2$ by $(x,y) \mapsto ((x-1)^2 (x+1), (x-1)(x+1)^2)$, whose image is a nodal cubic. 

You might like the proof in section 5.3 of Voisin's book Hodge theory and complex algebraic geometry. 

In order to finally kill every possible version of this question: No, even if $P$ is finite. Let $P$ be two incomparable elements. Then $DM(P)$ is the diamond poset $0 < p,q < 1$. The only maps of posets from $DM(P)$ to $P$ are to send everything to $0$ or everything to $1$. In particular, there is no surjection $DM(P) \to P$ and, thus, $P$ is not a quotient of $DM(P)$. To summarize comments above: If $L$ is a a finite lattice, then yes, since $L = DM(L)$. If $L$ is an infinite lattice, even a totally ordered one, then no (simplest example is $\mathbb{Z}$). And the example above shows the answer is also "no" for finite posets. 

I pause for an example: Let $F : \mathbb{C}^{\ast} \to \mathbb{C}^{\ast}$ be the $q$-th power map, so the fixed points are the $q-1$ many nonzero roots of $z^q=z$. Let $\zeta$ be a primitive $q-1$ root of unity. Then $\psi(g)(z) = \sum_{k=1}^{q-1} g(\zeta^k z)$ for any function $g$ on $\mathbb{C}^{\ast}$. In particular $$\psi(z^a) = \begin{cases} q z^{a/q} & a \equiv 0 \bmod q \\ 0 & a \not \equiv 0 \bmod q \end{cases}.$$ Working a bit harder, $$\psi(z^a dz/z) = \begin{cases} z^{a/q} dz/z & a \equiv 0 \bmod q \\ 0 & a \not \equiv 0 \bmod q \end{cases}.$$ No, I am not missing a factor of $q$. The push forward of $dz/z$ along the $q$-th power map is $dz/z$. Let's write $w$ for the coordinate on the source space and $z$ on the target, so $F^{\ast} z=w^q$ and $F^{\ast} (dz/z)=q dw/w$. Then $$\psi(dw/w) = \psi((1/q) dz/z) = \sum (1/q) d(\zeta^k z)/(\zeta^k z) = q\cdot(1/q) dz/z=dz/z.$$ Morally, the trace of $\psi$ on $\Omega^0$ wants to be $q$, and on $\Omega^1$ wants to be $1$. When we pass to $H^0$ and $H^1$, this is true with no analytic subtlties. (So $q-1$ is the number of fixed points, as desired.) To make the argument on $\Omega^j$, one uses the word "nuclear" a lot. I don't understand this part, but I believe that one of the reasons to use $\psi$ instead of $F^{\ast}$ is that $\psi$ is nuclear. 

Higman's group seems like a pretty good example. Of course, it acts on itself, but it has no action on any finite set or finite dimensional vector space, and the only reasonable description is by generators and relations. 

This is a first order statement by the above discussion. It is true when all the variables range over $\mathbb{R}$, because $(S^2)^n$ is compact. So it is also true when all variables range over $\mathbb{R}^{alg}$. Let $A^{alg}$ be the maximum volume of a sphere with real algebraic coordinates; we have just shown that this number exists. Let $A$ be the maximum volume of a sphere with real coordinates. It remains to check that $A = A^{alg}$. Let $f(t)$ be the minimal polynomial of $A^{alg}$ over $\mathbb{Q}$. Let the real roots of $f$ be $x_1$, $x_2$, ...., $x_n$ with $A^{alg} = x_r$. Consider the statement 

We have $$\frac{1}{\zeta(s)} = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{\mu(n)}{n^s} \quad \mbox{for} \ Re(s)>1.$$ Taking the derivative with respect to $s$, we get the following $$- \frac{\zeta'(s)}{\zeta(s)^2} = - \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (\log n) \frac{\mu(n)}{n^s} \quad \mbox{for} \ Re(s)>1.$$ If we plug in $s=0$ to the second equation (which is not allowed, because the second equation is only valid for $Re(s)>1$) we get $$ - \frac{\zeta'(0)}{\zeta(0)^2} = - \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \mu(n) \log(n) \quad \mbox{(FALSE EQUATION)}.$$ We have $$\zeta(0) = - \frac{1}{2} \quad \zeta'(0) = - \frac{1}{2} \log(2 \pi)$$ so $$ - \frac{\zeta'(0)}{\zeta(0)^2} = 2 \log(2 \pi)$$ So, if we believed the false equation, we would have $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \mu(n) \log(n) = -2 \log (2 \pi) \ \mbox{and} \ \prod_{n=1}^{\infty} n^{\mu(n)} = \frac{1}{4 \pi^2}.$$ I don't know why Mathematica thinks it's okay to plug in $s=0$. 

According to my hand computation, the claim is not true for $K = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{3})$. Have you checked this case? It is true that a prime ramifies in $K$ if and only if it ramifies in the Galois closure of $K$. There might be a formula like the one you are describing that is true for primes greater than $d$. 

Have you checked the case n=3? I get 12 cases, not 9. Listed by the number of pieces in each row, I get 1 of type 300 3 of type 210 3 of type 201 1 of type 030 3 of type 012 1 of type 003 

If and only if all the entries of $A^{-1}$ are non-negative. Proof: If $(A^{-1})_{ij}$ is negative, and $b$ is $1$ in the $j$-th coordinate and very small in every other, then $A^{-1} b$ is negative in the $i$-th component. On the other hand, if every entry of $A^{-1}$ is non-negative, then clearly $b$ positive implies $A^{-1} b$ positive. 

However, there is a sense in which $T^{\ast} O_{\lambda}$ is almost an affine variety, which I will now sketch. Before I get into the details, let me the first example. When $G=SU(2)$, then $O_{\lambda}$ is $\mathbb{CP}^1$ and $T^{\ast} O_{\lambda}$ is the total space of the line bundle $\mathcal{O}(-2)$. This can be viewed as the blow up of the singularity $xz+y^2=0$, and the global holomorphic functions on $T^{\ast} O_{\lambda}$ are all pulled back from this singular cone. Notice that $xz+y^2=0$ is the same equation as $\left( \begin{smallmatrix} y & x \\ z & -y \end{smallmatrix} \right)^2=0$. This will be relevant later. Consider the variety $xz+y^2 = 1$, which is also $\left( \begin{smallmatrix} y & x \\ z & -y \end{smallmatrix} \right)^2=\mathrm{Id}$. This is a smooth Stein variety and has a map to $\mathbb{CP}^1$ sending $\left( \begin{smallmatrix} y & x \\ z & -y \end{smallmatrix} \right)$ to its first column. The fibers of this map are affine spaces and, in fact, this is an affine bundle. The corresponding vector bundle is, indeed, $\mathcal{O}(-2)$. Since an affine bundle is diffeomorphic to its corresponding affine bundle, choosing such a diffeomorphism gives a new complex structure on $T^{\ast} O_{\lambda}$ and that structure is Stein. 

I like Option 3. The question, when choosing between Options 2 and 3, seems to me to be whether you want a reader looking for this theorem to look in the intro or at the proof. This could either be a reader chasing a reference internal to your paper, or coming from some other paper which cites [Shulman, Lemma 7.2]. Either way, it seems to me you want him or her to go to Section 7. I see no reason not to number the theorem in the intro -- why not tell the reader where to find the proof? The exception I'd make is if the intro gives a less precise, more user friendly, version of the theorem. Then I'd give them separate numbers, so that they can be cited separately.
