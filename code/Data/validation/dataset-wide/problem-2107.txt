There is no reason for a Sales Manager to lie about these things. If it wasn't in your plan, I'm assuming you don't have much experience in sales. Find out if this is a commissioned position, a salaried position, whether you have quotas to meet, how you close a deal, how you get paid or get credit for a sale, ... Disregard the rumor Consider the rumor as flattery and nothing else. Play it straight. Be sincere. Ignore the politics. If you're working for a profitable, reputable, commercial entity then they will reward success. Focus on whether or not you'd be successful and happy at sales, regardless of the rumor. Once you've re-oriented yourself to the right path without the rumor, you'll find your proper direction and know what to do. 

I have always negotiated for better salaries. I have never taken the offer 'as-it-stands'. That being said, I'm now self-employed! Rules I apply: 

Don't take a shortcut across the lawn. That is selfish (in the most objective definition of the word). People / companies spent time and money making the surrounding area beautiful. It is hard enough to preserve our environment without people going "off trail" and destroying what was created. There are a series of principles known as Leave No Trace. The concept is that we should attempt to leave as little trace of our existence on Earth as possible in order to preserve the greater environment for both the natural (non-human) world and future humans. This method of conservation involves a seven point program of principles to follow. Although Leave No Trace is often applied in the Back Country (i.e. backpacking) there is no reason why it cannot be followed in the Front Country (i.e. likely where you are reading this!). The concept of conservation does not have to be put into "liberal" or "conservative". It can be thought of merely as are you consuming something that other people / animals / plants could or should use. Conservation can be a simple as "are you being selfish and consuming the grass by walking on it". If you are having no impact, then why not use the grass. However, if your impact is the destruction of the grass and encouraging other people to destroy the grass, then don't do it. Study the 

I have go with following sentence (Not extractly it because we are using Sinhala language.) and it worked.... Now his suggestions come via tech lead.... 

One of my best friend (a girl) works on a small but very high facility company in south Indian country. She started work just before two weeks. There are around 20 employees in that company. 3 women and others are men. She has very tiny breasts and always she worries about them. But the problem is not that... Almost all Coworkers in her company passes hints about her tiny boobs and laugh (other women also laughing ). When laughing they looked at her breast area too sometimes. This happens two, three times per day. She was in really uncomfortable situation, she has cried everyday when I meet her, but because of financial issues she can't resign. The salary of her is above than average (this is a high paying company). Otherwise, they are good Coworkers. They helps her to do office tasks, etc... There is no HR department. Both directors handle the HR also. She can't complain this about to director because of she in new, she is shy as well as she can't directly complain because these are hints... So they can said sorry we did not mean something like that.... How to handle this type of situation? What she can do without losing the job? 

If I don't care about the consequences, I'd write something like you've already written. However, I tend to write classic business letters even when writing email. I try to: 

I took a management class from a man that ran the production of the U.S. F-16 airplanes. He had a very wise expression in his closing slide. If an employee is not doing their job (including being practical) then determine 

Cream rises to the top. Do the best work you can. When there is no work for your team, judge for yourself what would improve the product and get your team to work on making a demo of what might enhance the product. This could be: 

Non-Profits / NGO's / Government Be aware that some organizations hire based upon your social attitudes. Typically these are not commercial companies. So, if you're headed in this direction, you need to ensure that you communicate the social value of what you learned while on travel and how it relates to the employer. For example, you traveled to India and learned how citizens interact with their government. This might position you well for an NGO that was interested in political movements. Commercial Entities What is the commercial value of your travel? "Worldliness" from travel experience does not necessarily translate into commercial success. However, meeting people, sharing experiences, finding innovate ways to eat / transport yourself / organize people may translate into sales, marketing, business development, or technical sales support in foreign nations. Did you learn a language? Develop a specific cultural sensitivity to an ethnicity or religion that could be valuable for a commercial entity. Focus on the Value Focus on the specific value that your travel offers. If it does not offer any, don't try to inflate it. You'd be better off soul searching as to what it offers than creating something feeble on your resume. 

There are many times like that.... So I just want to say just thanks. Then email is be like following.... Last two line are signature. 

Is this professional accepted mail? Or should I avoiding sending this types of mails? Then what should I add? 

Is it common practice for a school to force its staff to use school canteen? It depends on the country and school. For a example, It is a common practice in some schools in Sri Lanka. Teachers of some schools in Sri Lanka need to follow some rules like "You can't bring mobile phones to class", "You can't go outside in the school hours (Yes, interval consider as a school time)", etc,. So they can't go outside of the school in interval. So they have to buy the food from canteen if they didn't bring the meals. 

If I were you, I don't include my current position and I won't tell I am working currently in the interview also. I will tell that now I am looking for a job. The main reason for that is, most companies (At least in my country) don't like persons who changes jobs very frequency. If they asked why you resigned before find new job I will said that It is hard to find jobs / go interviews because of limited leaves and workload. And I will mention that financially I am OK or I am currently doing freelancing works too find a new job. If they asked when you can join us I will say I need to finish the freelancing works already started, so I need X weeks (Tell the notice period of current job ) of time. 

The best way to address all of these is to call. If you have a phone number, pick up the phone and contact whomever sent you the message. You'll learn (x10) as much from a phone call and some interaction than you will from an email or a text message. My time is too valuable to be treated like a cog in a gear and provide and automatic reply via email / text. If they want to hire me and I want to work for them, we're going to have to interact. A voice on the phone is the next best thing to being there in person to judge whether you want to work for them or not. 

Older people are not always better, but more experienced people can see patterns in development and business that transcend merely the newest techniques / programming language / algorithm / trends. Don't worry about your age. If you really have more value than your potential employer offers you, make your case. If they do believe you, you'd better live up to what you represented. If they don't believe you, go seek out another offer and work at a different place. If you can't find another job, maybe you're not worth what you thought you were worth. 

What is a sales job like in this company? How do I develop the skills to be good at sales? Do you think I'd be good at sales?
