I am a veteran runner (and I have also suffered ITBS when I began to run). Even worse, I have what's called "Morton's Toe" so that I am not even supposed to be running according to orthopaedics and podiatrists I am very sceptic in regard to stability additions to shoes for beginners and gait analysis. The reasons for that is common sense: When you start running your muscles are not yet adapted to the type of motion of the sport, specially legs and feet but all your muscles in general. When you train your muscles and tendons will change and with that your gait. Not only that: Your gait and even the shape of you feet will change during a run. Thus, if you correct the gait that you had when starting to run on a treadmill even if it is beneficial in the beginning there will be a point during your run where the limitations that the correction impose will not fit your actual needs. The only real way to address your gait and ITBS issues is working on your running form, this means running and strengthening your core, butt and legs: Do bridges, planks, lateral planks, side leg raises or if you have the time and opportunity engage in Pilates and search a good running coach. You can add a very good short drill for running form: On a soft surface (not sand) take out your shoes and run 10 yards at an easy leisurely pace with your hands hanging at your side, don't sprint, just imagine you are a child playing and concentrate on the way it feels, the way your feet touch the ground. Repeat this routine for 10 minutes or so running to one side and back resting as long as you feel. Once you have mastered that rise your hands at our sides to a point between your hips and you chest and swing them while running avoiding that to cross them over your body, how much angle you use and how you swing them is up to you but don't cross them past the centre of our body. And last but not least: Do small steps. The key to good and injury free running is high cadence rather than long strides, thus in the beginning use small steps, you will be able to increase your stride length with time. 

What does your current diet look like? What is your current marathon PR and what is leading you to think your diet may not have been quite right? You'll need to provide some insight into what you're currently eating before you can get any specific advice on what to change. There are many resources on the web that offer suggested plans and they all generally fall into similar recommendations. Marathon training burns a lot of carbs, how much you burn will differ based on your fitness level, experience, pace, and running economy. The general wisdom is that runners should be consuming a diet that is composed of between 65% and 70% carbohydrates. A typical marathon training diet is one that is around 65% carbohydrates,25% protein, and 10% fat. Here are several links to articles that will say roughly the same thing and give varying approaches to building your diet plan. You'll need to figure out what works best for your body through trial and error. 

From your posted schedule and your history mentioned in another comment I would think that running 1 long run per week at your current distance would be sufficient to keep you in shape to complete up to a half marathon with relatively low risk of injury (based on your stated history). Don't plan on being competitive, though. With only 1 slow long run a week you will lose speed. If you want to reduce that loss I would add in speed work once a week at least 2 days before/after your long run to allow for sufficient recovery to get the most out of each run. I would also alternate the type of speed work you do (intervals one week, tempo another) and I would suggest turning a few of your long runs into faster steady-state runs or fartleks. You could also play around with negative splitting a few long runs. That won't completely prevent losing a little speed but it should mitigate any loss. You're not going to get a definitive answer, I fear, because this is highly specific to your specific body/history/training needs. Conventional wisdom is that you can maintain fitness during the off season on 3 runs (2 short, one medium) for 5k/10k training (see this Q&A on winter maintenance) but your results will vary. Best of luck to you with this. 

I've also seen numbers in that range, there are a couple things you may consider: LBM (lean body mass) is a much better number to base calculations from because fat tissue has a tiny fraction of the protein needs that muscle has. LBM is not really correlated to BMI. So for an example, if we imagine you have a body fat % of 20% you have LBM = 73.6kg which gives 147g protein/day. I've read/used 1g/lbLBM = 2.2g/kgLBM as a maximum protein intake. That is to say that more than that you are not really seeing much additional benefit to eating the protein; it is probably being converted to glucose. Furthermore, depending on context in your body, this could be counterproductive (increasing blood sugar). So the 2 you've read is probably for the high end, you do not need this intake to get to where you want to be. The ideal will be a matter of opinion, my personal target is .8g/lbLBM = 1.76g/kgLBM which, for example at your weight and 20% LBM (of course you need to calculate your own LBM) would get 118g per day. As @JohnP mentions, protein comes from plenty of places and you do not need to get it all from your protein powder. If you supplement with 2 scoops of a good protein powder, giving you 50g of protein, you're down to 68g from food (again using my 20% body fat example with .8g/lb target) and that can be taken care of with a chicken breast, a few eggs and a glass of milk. And finally, yes, I know big serious lifters that will eat 10+ eggs/day, 4 scoops of whey protein and have meat for dinner. 

Actually I have to disagree with Baarn. There is such a thing as "omentum fat" which is visceral fat located near the stomach. See $URL$ It is not terribly uncommon among men to have larger fat deposits here, which is actually underneath the abdominal muscles, which is why the belly seems harder. A more thorough answer can be found here. To answer your question about whether subcutaneous fat "hardens", it's probably not true in the way you're thinking but yes it can develop.
