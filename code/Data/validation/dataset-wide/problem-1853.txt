Why should you see it as your fault? You shouldn't. You should see it as wrong. As a mistake. Then take responsibility for it by saying, for example, "I'm sorry this mistake got out. I did not double check the result of the proof reading, but I will do so in the future". This way you don't apologize for the mistake that other person made but take on responsibility for not having double checked it (which probably isn't even your job, at the moment) and make it your duty to do so in the future (thus accepting the responsibility in advance, making it obvious you care about the fact that this shouldn't happen). This is just one suggestion, maybe you find better ways of improving the situation. Another example: I'm a senior developer with not management or team leading role at all. I'm working on a new feature, togehter with two junior developers and while I'm out to lunch they deploy a version which I haven't seen before and which introduces a bug to production. I get back and see the mess that clearly didn't originate from me and I can either let it play out and see who's being hurt (usually the company in general) or I can take responsibility for it, hurrying to roll back the deploy, make sure everything works and put measures in place that - if approved by the mananger - make sure this won't likely happen again, like a rule that all deployments have been done by teams of two where at least one has to be a senior dev or above. You should. In a way. "Your fault" doesn't have to mean "the fault that originated in you", but can mean "the fault that you found and took upon you to eradicate". That's how you should see it. There's a fire. The firemen see it as their fire, not because they started it but because it's in the area they're protecting, so it's theirs to extinguish. 

Applying for job is sort of like sales with yourself as the product, so you can apply this here. What does this mean? I'll take your example: 

I think your best bet is to fuse the two: Find a job at a retailer specializing in health care. Use this second degree to your advantage. There's virtually no combination of two degrees that one can't use to their advantage when you have the right attitude. Transition from one field to the other in a step-by-step manner like this: 

Absent any real evidence that you're "slacking off", I think your best bet is to schedule a quick meeting with your new boss. Let him know that you're unsure what your current boss could be referring to, but that you've noticed he isn't taking your departure very well, and seems to be frustrated that he has to find a new employee and get them up to speed. Assure him that you are still fully motivated, that you're excited to go to work for the new team, and that you'd never jeopardize your employment or reputation the way the current boss is accusing you of doing. Ideally, you would follow up that meeting by having a meeting with the three of you to outline that: a) you were completely within the company policy about the team transfer, and b) you fully intend to fulfill your duties to the existing team throughout the three-month interim period, and c) you don't want to be accused of any "slacking" that's not actually occurring. Your boss needs to see that you recognize what's actually going on here, and that you're not going to accept slander without taking action to protect yourself. If your boss' boss could attend, he could make it clear that the transfer has been approved, and that he doesn't want to see any shenanigans in the meantime, but I'm unsure whether you or your new boss have enough influence to persuade him to attend. Above all, your tone throughout this situation should be matter-of-fact - as though it's obvious what's happening, that you're simply informing everyone of what they should already know. You can't get angry, or upset, or vindictive; you have to continue to work with everyone involved after this situation clears up. Ideally, your new boss walks away assured that you're committed to both your current and new teams, and the company as a whole, and your current boss understands that you're not going to put up with any additional rumor-mongering. 

Typically with a junior person in a role, I would expect they'd require more constant supervision, I'd need to review their work more frequently, and I'd need to assign them easier tasks. As time goes on, the amount of each would lessen as I gained more confidence in the employee, until eventually they reach "mid-level" status where I didn't need to give them any special treatment. So yes, seeing "junior" on a resume would make me wonder whether or not you were ready for a more hands-off role, or whether I'd need to make sure I had enough time to watch more closely. 

It may look like it, but don't treat this like a monologue. Listen to the other person, too. There may be something going on, you're not aware of. 

I don't think questions can reliably determine this. Two thinks you can rely on to a point are: Your gut feeling If you feel like they are trying to lull you and wouldn't hold up their end, don't take the position. Only take it if you feel really good about it. Your contract There are certain things you can have put into a contract if they're important to you. Some examples that I know: 

Disability is a lack of certain abilities, just abilities considered ubiquitous. That what I suggest treating it like. 

Salary prospects Usually there is some pool of extra salary companies hand out year-by-year in the form of small-ish percentage increases. New titles are always opportunities to negotiate pay raises beyond what these annual increases would give you, so to situate yourself better for future raises, you should drive a hard bargain to come with a new title (as there is new responsibility involved, too). On the other hand you don't want to be passed over when promotions are coming up. So there's a trade-off when chosing this route. Outside value If your short to medium term plan is to leave/switch companies anyway, grabbing titles and certifications will put you in a better position when negotiating with potential new employers. This may differ from country to country but I don't know of any laws that force you to disclose your exact current/last salary during an interview, so accepting a lower-than-average one for a promotion that will increase standing may be a good idea. Conclusion You have to know which direction your 'future growth' is taking, then the answer will be clear. 

Features: Motivation Working on your own projects, bits that you really want fixed/refactored from your daily work or similar things at your own pace and direction is very rewarding to a lot of programmers. Getting out of the box It sparks creativity, thinking through a whole stack, planning and coordinating with other team members and possibly presentation skills. Extending/Spreading knowledge Often people worked together on projects to learn from or with each other new skills, technologies or libraries. Improvements to company products or assets Almost everything I've ever seen done in this kind of environment eventually proved useful to the company. 

There are plenty of drawbacks to higher-paying jobs. They usually boil down to one thing - with greater pay comes greater responsibility. 

That way: 1) You're putting the resume in the expected order. 2) You're including relevant accomplishments from each position. 3) You're not having to include lesser accomplishments just to fill the space. 4) Yes, you've got more accomplishments from your older position, but you were there longer, so that's expected. 

What I read most often is this: Tailor your cover letter to the specific job you're applying for. Bring up specifics from the job description and explain why your experiences make you the perfect person for the job. The reason you may be reading "Tell us about your blog, etc. in the cover letter" is likely because those sorts of things don't usually fit in the resume itself, but if you can find a way that your open source contributions help you fit the job, then the cover letter is a great place to bring it up. However, if you're a new graduate, you may not have a lot of data in the Experience section of your resume anyway. Having a section for things like open source contributions and side projects might be a good idea. 

The common response I hear is similar to yours ("be vague; don't give them something to write down later in case you apply with them in the future"), but I see a benefit (to the company) to telling them "I'm sorry, but your offer is below market rate for my services, so I'm unable to accept it". If the company gets enough similar responses, it could give them the bargaining power to go to the higher-ups and say "we're getting a lot of push-back on this offer, saying it's too low. We need to reconsider improving it, or at least opening negotiations if it's the right person". (The fact that it's a pay cut opens that door to a slightly different answer as well - "I'm sorry, but your offer would be a pay cut for me, and I'm not in a position to accept that." The effect is the same ("we need to offer more money to attract the right candidate"), but it's even more understandable - "this person's not even necessarily looking for a pay increase, just to not have a pay decrease".) However, as you say, there's the risk of upsetting them if they're not happy to hear what you have to say. In the end, the answer is up to you - if you don't feel like risking it, there's nothing wrong with giving them the polite answer. (Considering you've discussed the benefits and salary enough that they told you "HR tied our hands", they'll probably at least infer that that's part of the reason, even if you don't mention it.) 

Just go ahead and ask for it. Be polite and state the purpose. For an annual review or similar it is totally legitimate to ask for such letters or mails and I wouldn't expect anybody to see this as selfish. Especially if they know the corporate ladder. Superiors should actually be happy about your request, I would think, as it shows you're invested in the company. EDIT: The pre-supposition is that the work done is actually out of scope of your current assignments and really goes 'above and beyond'. If you're just doing your work for somebody higher up in the food chain, this is what your job is about and you shouldn't expect any gold stars for it. 

This very much depends on where you are. Here in Germany, there's a lot of extra cost associated with contracting/freelancing, even beyond simple health care. When employed, insurance against unemployment and some sort of penion insurance are covered too, both of which can be argued about but they make accepting a lower but steady income not unreasonable. Also, again in Germany, there's the common conception that being employed instead of contracting binds you to a company for a longer term, which ideally would be in their best interest. A 'rebuttal' simply could be, that you prefer contracting and doing your insurances and taxes. 

I don't consider interviews as tests that can be passed or failed, but at opportunities to gauge whether the interviewee would fit the position I'm seeking filled. If they went through the trouble of researching what I might ask and prepared the answers on a sheet of paper, I might actually consider that a good thing, because it could show their determination to learn what it takes to get the job, and, by extension, maybe also do it well. What bad might come from this: probably only wasted time on either side. You pass the interviewee on to somebody with domain knowledge to find out whether their skills are adequate for the open position and they might figure out the interviewee is not. But unless you know the domain of the interviewee, you can't do much more than follow a script of questions about it. So failing to see that their answers might be scripted (unless you heard them before, verbatim), shouldn't reflect badly on you. 

I'm currently sitting on the other side of the table, building up a team. Maybe it's not the norm but for me, if you 'talk the talk' as they say, I can get a feeling for whether candidates are good on the job and ultimately I'll form my picture working with a candidate on a trial day, or pair programming session. So, if you genuinely are good at a job, display it not by preening yourself on something but by having an honest conversation, being interested in what problems you would be facing and - if you can - Current producer supplier, on how you would approach those difficulties, regardless of whether you would be hired. Would work with me, at least.
