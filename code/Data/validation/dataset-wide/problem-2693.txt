Is finding a solution for a problem in a given context is an attempt to find a solution for the problem in another context? For example, it seems some of the hardest problems of real analysis were not solved till their solutions were found in the context of geometry. Update: I think it makes the question more clear if I provide an example. Lets say I want to prove if x+y=x+z, then y=z, where x,y,z $\in F$, where $F$ is a an algebraic field with operation "+". For example for this problem I can think of context where solution exits and that would be the ring of integers. If 1+2=2+1 then I can show 1=1. Now once this solution is found using this context of integers I can now apply this to the original problem in the context of field. Now what I was asking was that should such a solution exists in some contexts (context as used in example above) for a problem to be solvable. I do not know the background science behind this but it would be great if references can be introduced so I can get to know the right terminology. 

You might be very interested in reading this book: $URL$ I read it 5/6 so far, its really life perspective changing and very positive and constructive. Its the best book I read about truth and consciousness so far, and I read quiet a few. With its logical assessments and derivations, it truly is a Big Theory of Everything. 

Maybe gods will is more of a logical thing than a choice of some being. Much like the algorithm of a fractal. A fractal can only grow (or come into existence) when energy is applied to the right formula. Time is not required for the fractal algorithm to exist, in potency it exists without time. So in potency the whole fractal up to endless iterations already exists, without time. But in order to create the 1024th iteration, to bring it in to existence, you have to have time, because energy needs to be put in to do the calculations. We people tend to anthropomorphize god. But maybe god is just "the right thing" that allows creation. Just like a fractal algorithm allows you to create endlessly. You can't be calculating a fractal and suddenly change the algorithm and expect to be still creating an endless pattern. You might be well ending up in a pattern with a dead end if you do. In my view, gods will equals fractal logic. It is the only way to keep creating. In that sence, yes gods will is timeless, and its will to create isn't a contradiction with being timeless. EDIT: In addition to creationism vs evolution: I believe we are part of both. Initially we were created and 'let loose' to evolve. Much like a programmer can create artificial self learning intelligence. It is created, yet it evolves. And where is the beginning in that? There is none, I believe its a fractal pattern with no beginning nor end :) 

Suppose there is a magical kingdom that is hidden somewhere over the rainbow and can never be reached by anything, most people would say that such a place might as well not exist. However, the same people will probably say that distant galaxies that will retreat beyond the observable universe does exist. What is the difference? Sure, distant galaxies has left traces of starlight, but one can also argue that the tale of magical kingdoms also originated from fact, before it is magically sealed away. Would Occam's razor be the only reason why we should believe in distant galaxies and not magical kingdoms? (because starlight coming from distant galaxies and legends made up by drunks are easier to believe than perfectly projected light-shows by alien and magic?) 

This answer is based on the following assumption: It is better to have experience accompanied by knowledge, than just knowledge. So lets try the following to (hopefully) gain experience. See it as me proving to you that you can discern between states of dreaming and states of wakefulness, I can't just do that with solely you reading text I typed, you have to do something. This is based on the assumption that reality is more than just intellect. The other (right) half of your brain is also involved in processing your reality, and that is the emotional/experimental aspect. So do the exercise below, please: 

There are certain people who consider conscious beings or "life", however that is define, to be important in the sense that there is some form of intrinsic value in them or that they are axiomatically mandated for the functioning of the universe. Notable examples include Alfred North Whitehead, possibly Julian Jaynes and some obscure Stefan Schindler. My question is, what are some arguments, preferably those based on physical sciences, that suggest life and conscious existence to be more than a stable arrangement of particles not unlike rocks or stars? When I talk about the relationship between science and values, I am looking for arguments that suggest some kind of objective sanctity in life or consciousness. For example, so likely misinterpreted "theories" of quantum mechanics treats conscious observers as having more physical effect on the universe than the amalgamation of flesh and blood they are. Whitehead seems to adopt some strain of such ideas, but his arguments are obscure and by no means exclusive, hence the question. 

Do you think we as humans in general use certain prove strategies to prove things? Regardless of the topic being mathematics or any other topics, do you think we have finite and limited ways of approaching proof-related problems? For example, see this. If the above is true this means they are certain strategies that we need to follow, where do you think the creativity comes in? If they are certain strategies to follow, where do you think the creativity comes in? Does it come in come in when we try to apply a given strategy to a problem. How does proving things in mathematics differ from real world? 

Don't anthropomorphize God. It doesn't have to necessarily be a being with feelings. It might just be a system that hosts beings to evolve, that have feelings. Flooding the earth in SimCity isn't horrible at all to the computer that causes the event. 

This is something you can teach yourself, just like playing the piano. The point of this is that you self-reflect that you are not doing anymore what you want to do and get back at it. Google on "lucid dreaming and fMRI" and you will have biological evidence that areas in the brain of self reflection are more active during lucid(conscious/awake) dreaming, than non lucid dreaming. That your mind is wondering of is because the angst/anxiety is controlling you (or you let it control you). First you will experience those fears that are just beneath the conscious surface. The more you practice the exercise above, the more angst you will discover that lies deep down inside you. When you know/experience they are there, you can do something about it, recude them, and take control. Can you imagine, that those fears that live deep down inside you, that almost never get to the surface, influence very much of your daily life experience? As long as there are others things controlling you (or you are letting them control you) you have less control than you could possible have: you are dreaming. This has thought me that I am dreaming often throughout the day, while almost anybody would say they are perfectly awake and not dreaming at all. That is because I am not skilled enough yet to constantly think about what I want and act upon that. The exercise above gives me more control of experience life because I can put more into it of how I want it to be, because of reducing the fears. I even start living at night: consciously experiencing the dream reality. Its starts with playing around (like children learn their environment) but it becomes more than that. You can really practice overcoming fears and use strong willpower (intention) to create what you want and see the effects immediately. So the give one concrete answer to your question: You know you aren't dreaming in some aspect when you have consciously created what you wanted in that aspect that has created synergy (more than there was). I use aspect because again, this isn't a binary state. It is not that you create all that you(with good intention) desire, or you create nothing at all. That would also imply there is an ending state. But combining stuff to create synergy is endless. It is fact you can create partially, step by step, what you desire: the house, spouse, children, work, quality time you desire, as long as it creates synergy. That is how your consciousness grows. Look up things like: 

For example, in real life if we want to prove someone is innocent we simply find a group of trusted witnesses to testify someone is innocent. In other words, to prove q in real life, we can easily find a p which results in q and it is not very challenging. What makes this challenging in mathematics though? Is it because we are not acquainted with mathematics world, the way we are with real world and once we become well familiar we can easily establish truth in mathematics world too? Update: Based on the provided suggestions I would like to narrow down the question a bit further. If we think of a proof as a chain of logical arguments, which starts from the set of axioms (assumptions) and reaches some conclusions (theorems), then how would mathematician try to establish this logical link between axioms and theorems (questions 1 and 2 above relate to this argument). Furthermore, it seems establishing this link between assumptions to the theorems is much easier in real life, regardless of the actual truth of the assumptions (question 3 above relates to this argument) Please see @MarkOxford's answer and comments there for further clarification. 

Weak emergent properties are said to be properties of a large system that can be predicted or derived by computing the interactions of the system's constituent parts. Strong emergent properties of a system are said to be impossible to predict by computing the interactions of its constituents. However, there does not seem to be any examples of strong emergent properties that is not simply weak emergence on steroid--e.g.: human consciousness as a collection of neurons, human society as a collection of persons; all of these seem possible to completely predict using fundamental particles, initial conditions and immense, though finite number of computations. So, my question is, is there a "discrete" difference between strong and weak emergence? Or is strong emergence simply weak emergence that requires astronomical number of calculations? 

Preamble: I think we have this sort of questions, where we are required to find a solution for them. For example, what is the area of a circle?. I think the way to solve these problems is to try to find similar problems. If the solution to the similar problems does not apply, then we try to figure out why, and this might help us to find the right solution. However, we have another type of problems, where we need to establish the truth of something. For example, proving a theorem, which are in nature different from the first type of questions. I do not think the same approach as before can be applied for these problems. I do not think there exist recipes or structures to follow either once it comes to proving things, but I do think there should be certain strategies or plan as you wish to approach these in mathematics? Questions: Based on the above introduction, I have the following questions: 

No, it wouldn't, it would be better. If all beings were to act good, synergy will be formed, hence everybody would live a happier live. "Would it be better if everyone was good?" Yes. 

What it says, in my perspective is, is analogous to the following: You don't specifically need software application A to show the logical behavior of transistors inside a CPU. You could also do that with software application B. So here software application A and B are the subject matter, or the content terms. Where as the behavior of the CPU is the abstract level you are proving the logical behavior of. Here is another example. The concept of addition. Here I proof the logical validity of addition: "When I take 3 apples, and I take 2 apples more, and put these inside a bag, I have 5 apples in my bag." The logical concept proven here doesn't require an example with apples. It could have been any example to explain the concept op addition. So the subject matter of apples inside a bag is not important to proof the logical form of addition. If apples would be required, its not an abstract logical concept. As logic doesn't apply to specific matter. Math for example doesn't only apply to the stock market, but applies on the whole universe.
