So the guy is trying to make the computer feel something like a survival instinct. Let's start there, because I think what you have is the audience's experience in mind. Which is cool, but we need our dumbed down writer's understanding of what's going on. Which we don't have to reveal to the audience at all of course. But just so it all makes sense to me and you can actually generate some outcomes/possibilities, I'll just make up some stuff to fill in my own gaps in understanding. You of course may have a different understanding. I'm guessing you have some kind of neural net/genetic algorithm thing going on so repeated trials of the AI are giving it more and more information from past trials, thousands or millions of trails. So you would think that the algorithm that randomly just stays on longer would eventually win out given the length of the trials and the fitness function (what tells a genetic algorithm it's doing well) or due to the explicit training and instructions you give a neural net (try to stay on). These would be normal approaches for someone experimenting with AI. But something is wrong. Despite all his efforts, his AI isn't picking what should be a logical result. And he can't figure out why. If it was my story, I would probably say that his very act of programming the machine himself was putting into it something of himself. This is completely normal too, programmers have the job of solving a problem for one case and making it automatic for all subsequent cases. In order to do that, you have to solve the problem in your head first. And the way you do that is the way it comes out in the code. If you're just one person working on one non-trivial project there is going to be a lot of yourself in the code. My first twist/reveal/turn is that he's depressed. So he made a depressed AI. And you could show that with atmospherics in the film. Show his world as dark, grimey, gothic?, and then when you get to lunch with his friend, you see the world is actually quite different from the one he lives in. A little clearer. A little less hopeless, people don't feel helpless. This can be the first hint about him being different from the world. So that presents us with a few options. Let's say he's not depressed in general in a mental illness kind of way, but rather depressed about something specific. Maybe he's grieving. Maybe he has to let go of something but wont. Then either we have a happy ending and he doesn't get instantly better or anything but rather starts down the path of acknowledging he has a problem, trying to get help. The darker path would be he turns his back on all that even though he has the opportunity to get help. The "Im a depressed teenager myself" dark ending is even though he wants to get help he can't because no one is listening or pays attention to him. The medium dark ending can be satisfying if he turns his back on getting help because of a compelling reason to him. And at that point you think "yeah, I dont know what I would choose." Something like this: He lost someone. He can't let go of it. But why can't he let go? Maybe because he caused it. So it's not just that he lost them, he can't forgive himself for causing their death. Now the lazy way for this to go down would be something like, he killed the woman he loved after he found out she was cheating. That's a little too easy for me. Maybe he could pull a cain/golem and kill his best friend out of jealousy. Maybe it was an accident. Maybe it wasn't his action, but his inaction that caused their death. Maybe his childhood friend was drowning in a pool but he was just paralyzed in fear and didn't save him. Whatever it is, as an audience member you kind of want some honor or justification for him taking his own life. Maybe he wanted to watch his friend die? Now I'm creeping myself out. Way too early in the morning for that. So to recap in bullet points: depressed boy creates AI AI chooses wrong in trials depressed boy goes to non-depressing lunch AI puts boy in trials depressed boy confronts his past depressed boy ends the trials If he offs himself then there is still the question of what happens to the AI. Maybe the AI kills itself one more time and we can deduce that it really wanted to kill itself the whole time and it hated being brought back again and again. That could be a little gem you hint to the audience. Sorry for the really long answer. Good luck with your story! 

Convection currents in Earth's mantle create the movements of the continents. You could just have a particularly turbulent mantle that would have many opposing currents. On Earth we have a thick mantle layer, that means big currents. Maybe on your planet the core makes up most of the mass of the planet, leaving the less dense silicates and other rock material to convect in smaller pockets. Imagine a thick liquid that you're boiling in a pot. In a deep pot with lots of liquid, the middle has this huge flow that always seems to be coming up. But if it's a thin layer, you would have lots of little flows everywhere. In the thin layer, the currents don't get a chance to combine and reinforce each other on their trip up to the surface. 

I'm not a security expert, but I think you can do most of this with simple private key/public key encryption. You just need to establish the correct protocols so everything can be verified, and trust the private keys remain private. So it's not infallible, but then again nothing is. The car and cop need to be able to generate encrypted signed messages meant for the car's manufacturer, meaning no one else can decrypt the messages and they are verified as being to-and-from either the car and the manufacturer or the cop and the manufacturer. The cop generates a random token and it sends an ID request to the manufacturer for this car's stated name. At the same time, the car uses the random token and sends it's authorization to be verified to this officer. You could do it other ways, but this way means the officer and the car both have to consent to being verified. Since the cop is getting verified too the cop also sends the token to the main police authorization service (we'll call it Big Blue). This step isn't necessary. I just like it this way so not just anyone can verify a car. The manufacturer decrypts both messages. The car says "Hello manufacturer X, it's me Bob, please verify with officer Pebbles Larue (token)", then it gets a message from the cop and says "This is officer Pebbles Larue, please tell me if this is Bob or not (token)," then the token gets sent to Big Blue and Big Blue says officer Pebbles is on the up and up, so the manufacturer responds to Pebbles with a thumbs up emoji, meaning this is indeed Bob. 

If it sucks energy it must be storing it somewhere. You could poke holes in it so it looses containment of it's energy. I get that if you throw a spear at it, it can absorb the kinetic energy, but what happens if you just stabbed it slowly? What happens if it doesn't know it's getting hit by a spear? When I first started thinking about it, I thought this thing sucks energy, so it has negative energy, negative + positive = 0, so that should take care of it. But that's not true, the being isn't net negative. It appears black because it takes in energy, so it's an incredibly energetic being, very net positive. So the opposite of that would be something actually negative. He sucks in energy, yes, but he is made of energy? maybe? so if you could actually produce negative energy, like a higgs field at 0, then you could still hurt it. 

Really sorry for the long answer. It's the product of too much coffee. tldr; Kill off the people that weren't going to live long with, for example, a virus that shortens your telomeres. -- When you think about evolution you have to think about one thing above all the others. Reproduction. Evolution is driven entirely by and for reproduction. If we're smarter than homo heildelbergensis then it's because being smart helped us reproduce. It either helped us find resources or stay away from danger, but the reason for being smart is so that you can indirectly, reproduce better. To turn it on its head, if being smarter only meant that we all became basement dwellers and never saw the light of day, we wouldn't be very sexy, and probably wouldn't reproduce. If that were the case the species would not become smarter. Fitness is a term that in this context means reproductively fit. Your fitness is basically how well you reproduce. So if it's a thousand of years ago and you're big and strong and you're able to hunt and protect your family, then you reproduce. Your genes get passed on. Your offspring survive to become big strong people and so on. There are counter examples where being bigger might be a disadvantage but let's leave those for another discussion. This is just a simple example. Another important thing to remember is that evolution does not go towards anything. There is no end goal in mind. A bear has a white coat when its brothers and sisters all have brown coats. The white coat helps him hide in the snow. There was no force that was driving him towards whiteness, it just happened randomly and it turned out to be a little better than brown. He hunted better, got fed and that let him reproduce more than everyone else. Now let's start the experiment. We want immortal human beings. How do we get there? Currently, "all things being equal" (they're not, I know), everyone of breeding age is reproducing. That means that people who will live to be older than 100 and people who will kick it in their mid 60s are all reproducing. Right now there's no fitness related to longevity. Everyone can start breeding when they're done puberty regardless of how long they're going to live. So that would need to change. Let's just say that since we do have a goal in mind (immortality), we can build to that goal gradually and have intermediate goals (longevity). So we allow for some circumstance that takes people who weren't going to live that long out of the gene pool. They are no longer reproducing. Not with our octogenarians, not with each other, nobody. Their short lived genes will die with them. Now we have a breeding population of very old people. As other posters have mentioned, it really is about that reproductive age. Once you hit menopause you are no longer passing along your genes. Whatever you already passed along is what you passed along. If you live to be 300 after you hit menopause it won't matter because no one knew you were that sexy and you never reproduced more than the average person, let's say. So it's not enough to just live longer in and of itself, you must retain your ability to reproduce in order for that to be a fitness factor. So that's it really. Those that won't live long must not reproduce (or reproduce as much, depending on how long you want the immortality process to take), and those that live longer must reproduce more. The question is how do you know? And that's what your original question is all about. What natural conditions will lead to this outcome? Without knowing ahead of time who is going to die of natural causes early and who is going to age like wine, natural conditions can't really select those people. So you're going to need to invent a mechanism that can tell who is going to die early, either directly or indirectly. Here's where it gets interesting. Imagine a virus like any other virus, except that it doesn't kill the host. It makes a copy, leaves a gene in your cell that says "do not infect me" and then leaves you alone. It's a whole other class of virus, real smart and sustainable virus. Let's add one curious effect of this virus: it decreases your telomere length (if you believe this is the basis of all aging and not a cumulative set of deteriorating genes or other mechanisms). So it makes everyone age. Everyone gets the disease, everyone is infected. Everyone is aging way faster than they should be. See where I'm going with this? :) So who lives? The people whose cells just happen to be slightly better at repairing telomeres. So they reproduce and only they reproduce, which leads to the start of generations of ubertelomeremensch. This is one way but you could do it other ways. Maybe radiation from a star makes everyone age and mutate and only organisms with strong DNA repair (not just shielding) can survive. Basically, you want the people to die off who aren't going to live long anyway. That'll do it. You make the people who will live long more reproductively fit and they'll evolve to at least very long lives. And we are talking about the species as a whole. If you wanted to do an offshoot and say "these jungle people over here bred mortality right out of their stock", you could do that too. To be ever weary of the randomness of the process however, and as a counter example, evolution might prefer people with a certain protein or a certain overactive organelle. And, at first, it may have nothing to do with longevity, but through the course of random evolution it will provide the key function to repairing cells and DNA indefinitely. Other interesting things to consider: the cells in your body come from your parents, those cells came from their parents, those cells came from their parents. If you follow the line all the way back you end up with some thing in our sweet mother Earth's history that found a way to reproduce itself over and over until we ended up with you. It might not be the same person, but it's life. That's called germ line immortality, and it's pretty dog gone amazing. I had another point to make but I forgot it. Must be getting old.
