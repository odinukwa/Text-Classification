Certainly there are those that consider music to be literature. In fact, the organization PEN New England (a chapter of PEN America) which among other things 

Tyrion in well aware of what is going on even takes a small verbal jab at Robb to which Robb jabs right back. 

So how I would interpret the line is that since the child's right hand is wasted, that is a "risk" to try to get the button away from his left. The child is playing a game with themselves the "desired result" being the right hand winning the button from the left. 

Your understanding of the word gamble is a bit incomplete. While the most common usage is with games on chance (i.e. betting money), broader sense is an risk: 

Beyond that the Bantam edition shows a preview with some of the illustrations, while the Harper edition preview reverts back to a standard preview. As mentioned in the comments, the blurb on the German Amazon site for the Harper edition and on American Amazon for the Bantam are almost an exact match 

First, the Ghost breaks the earth-shattering news that Hamlet's uncle killed his father. Then, he tells him not to be rash, nor let this taint his mind. But it clearly does taint his mind. After all, Christian values teach us to forgive, not to take revenge. The Ghost is advocating revenge. And that is the chief ambition of the Devil. So, if the Ghost is Hamlet's father, then he is certainly not purifying himself by coming back as a spirit and enticing his son into revenge. That's called temptation. It's fair to question whether this really is Hamlet's father. But I think the play rightfully does not focus on this question. Instead, it focuses on Hamlet's agency, given what he has heard. In summary, the Ghost speaks truthfully about the murder of Hamlet's father, but it's ambiguous whether the Ghost actually is Hamlet's father. It could be some demon, or the Devil himself. I think it's worth asking why the Ghost says what he does, and advocates what he does. But ultimately, the play is about Hamlet's struggle to find his way out of the maze he ends up in. To revenge himself seems wrong, but not to revenge himself seems equally wrong. He has a hard predicament, and it's enlightening to see how he finally achieves peace. 

So I guess we have to accept that at most the ice dragons in A Song of Ice and Fire are a homage to The Ice Dragon. 

Varys and Illyrio were both poor when they met and teamed up and worked together to become rich. Bronn is the poor one and uses a chance encounter to befriend himself to Tyrion (who is already rich) and then become rich. Bronn doesn't help Jaime in campaigns as he does on the show. In the books Bronn goes off to Stokeworth after marrying Lollys (we see this in the show). The Dorne subplot is completely different and in the books timeline Daenrys has not made it back to Westeros yet, so we don't know if Bronn will be involved with that. 

The two other answers have shown the directly George denies the connection, but ice dragons do (might) exist in Planetos... 

You will notice that the Harper cover is shown second even though it is an exact title match while the Bantam "original" edition is listed shown first. Digging a bit deeper the Harper edition is listed as one of seventy-one other formats for A Game of Thrones, while the Bantam is listed as its own work. 

($URL$ I'm only interested in the first stanza for now. I have mixed feelings about the first stanza. I like the image of decrepit age being something tied to a dog's tail. It really serves to show how foreign age is to the poet's soul; it is simply not a part of him, but something he tows along. I like the idea that age excites his imagination more, but when its song is dormant he must content himself with an old friend — Plato or Plotinus, interesting reading choices. He seems to be saying that Plato and Plotinus come in handy until the imagination is ready to soar. But then, when the poet is ready to sing, when the imagination is ready to soar, there is no song, no beauty. Only this alternate possibility that things will go wrong, and the poet will be derided by a "battered kettle at the heel". What does this phrase even mean? I can only think of a tea kettle. Why would it be battered? What image is he trying to show? What point is he trying to make? 

Here's the original Polish text of this passage (plus half a sentence as the sentence breaks are different in the translation). I highlighted the sentence that was translated as “A giant Negress was coming silently towards me with a smooth, rolling gait.” 

The text This is a translation in verse, so don't set too much store on the exact wording. Some of the words may have been chosen for rhythm and rhyme rather than for precise meaning. For reference, here's the Latin original (or at least one of the preserved Latin texts, I don't know if we know what the exact original is): 

The prophecy is definitely meant to make Psyche and her entourage believe that Psyche is supposed to be killed. But this point in the story, the reader knows that Venus has wished Psyche a fate worse than death: she is to fall in love with the worst possible person (IV:31: “hominis extremi, quem (…) Fortuna damnavit (…)”: the most extreme human damned by fortune (…)). So for the reader, the prophecy ostensibly suggests that Psyche will fall in love with the monster that it describes rather than being killed by it. If we interpret the description of the monster symbolically rather than literally, it fits the embodiment of love. 

What do you think the Ghost might be lying about? Claudius definitely murdered his brother, which we find confirmed in the play-within-a-play (act 3 scene 2), and by Claudius's own confession (act 3 scene 3). However, it's true that the Ghost might not be Hamlet's father. In that case, it would still have to know the details of his father's death, and the details of his father's life. Perhaps it is some infernal spirit who has this knowledge. This is actually a very interesting question. I think there is no definite answer to this question. It's ambiguous. But it is worth asking questions about the Ghost's intent. Consider these words from the Ghost. 

Notice how his hair has grown "half over his ears". This recalls an image of Karenin that we encounter early on. 

I think there is indeed symbolism in Vronsky's bald spot. One of Karenin's chief characteristics is his ears, which is often the first thing people notice of him. Ears are meant for hearing—hearing rumors, gossips, scandalous affairs. Whereas a bald spot is something that people often conceal. It could easily symbolize an adulterous relationship. Consider this scene at the military camp, in which an officer calls to Vronsky as he leaves his Finnish hut. 

So my interpretation of that boils down to... We consider poems and plays to be literature, songs are just shorter more musical versions of that. An opinion piece I found sums it pretty nicely. 

Notice how the curves (the fluting) serves to hide the joint in way the flows into the circular structure. Without the fluting those joint are more visible. With a solid piece of marble this is not needed as one can carve and shape the stone in anyway they like without having joints at all. However, I don't think Roark's primary argument is "historical" at all really... it boils down to "First vs Best". A Roark says - "Your Greeks took marble and they made copies of their wooden structures out of it, because others had done it that way." - and that is an argument as old as time and will be made when comparing older works of art to newer ones. Who should we admire more William Shakespeare or Thomas Lanier "Tennessee" Williams? Who should we admire more George Herman "Babe" Ruth or Derek Jeter? Who should we admire more Michelangelo or Salvador Dali? These of course are all subjective questions that whole novels could be written on. Just because you were first doesn't make you the best, but just because you were the best doesn't mean you be recognized as such. Even still Roark's argument was that the Greeks were not even creative, they merely copied what was already done, just with a new material. It would be more like if Dali was famous for painting the Mona Lisa but he used watercolors. In the end, art is almost a wholly subjective field for critique. Roark simply has this view on Greek architecture, regardless of what the masses or experts tell him. He just uses the historical claim to show he has at least applied some level of critical thinking to the issue. 

Something got lost in translation here. The word “girls” gives the wrong impression. The French original (from “Une Soirée”) is “demoiselles”, which can refer to any unmarried woman. Read the scene again, but substitute “ladies” for “girls”. Varajou asks the waiter where to have fun, and the waiter's idea of having fun is to sit there and have a drink. Varajou then asks where to meet ladies, and the waiter points him to a house where there are ladies holding reception. Varajou was never explicit about what kind of ladies he's looking for, so the waiter's response is not that unreasonable. ”Supreme Court“ may also give a wrong impression. The master of the house is an important person, and is a judge, but he's the “premier président de Mortemain”. (In modern times, “premier président” means the head judge in an appeals court, I don't know if the structure of courts was exactly the same in Maupassant's time, but it wouldn't have been too different in terms of how to place that person socially.) That means he's a locally important person. The waiter directed Varajou to a house in the neighborhood with (probably marriageable) ladies of good family. For scale: the population of Vannes in 1883 was about 20,000. The story plays on the opposition between Varajou and the sleepy town of Vannes.
