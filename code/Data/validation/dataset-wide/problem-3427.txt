...and "better able to predict" is essentially defined in the first sentence (reduced prediction error variance, which is $\sigma^2 (X\mid U)$, conditional on $U$, that includes $Y$). In other words, Granger shamelessly used the word "causality" as a synonym for "predictive power": if information on $Y$ improves our predictions on $X$ then "$Y$ is causing $X$". His implicit argument is clear: if they correlate there may be also a causative link here -who knows?... No wonder scholars felt the need to subsequently name it "Granger-causality" -proving Granger's strategic mastery in name-giving! So no, no relation to Rubin's concept. 

The grey-haired "Quantity Theory of Money" is a good initial way to gain some clear understanding for inflation. This theory is just one equation, $$PQ = VM$$ where $P$ is the price level, $Q$ is quantity produced, $M$ is money supply, and $V$ is "velocity of money", which represents how "fast" money circulate, given the transactional technology and other institutional aspects of an economy. For example, in an economy where bank branches are interconnected by a real-time on-line system, money circulates faster compared to an economy where bank branches are interconnected only through, say, telegraph, which in turn move money faster compared to an economy where banks are not interconnected at all, and money has to move physically from one person to another. Assume that we produce $Q=10$ pieces each at a price of $P=15$ kudos. Do we need $10 \times 15 = 150$ kudos to complete all buy-and-sell transactions? No. If velocity of money is, say $V=3$, we only need $M=50$ kudos to facilitate all transactions, because money circulates "three times around" (before the next production cycle is completed). Now, in standard economic theory, economies are close to "full employment level of production factors" (which may allow for friction unemployment of humans, machines etc). Now, assume we increase the money supply to $M=100$. The right-hand-side of the equation becomes $VM = 3 \times 100 = 300$. What happens to the left-hand-side? Well, since production cannot increase (because all available production factors are already employed), it has to be the Price level that will increase to $P=30 \implies PQ = 30 \times 10 = 300$. Intuitively, buyers with more money in their hands will increase their demand (the demand schedule will shift rightwards in a diagrammatic representation), but supply won't change, because it cannot change. Suppliers will increase their prices since there is now "competition among buyers". Hence, inflation. This is the most simple explanation about how increasing the quantity of money in a full-employment situation, will create inflation. 

Looking at the US Economy, the US Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and specifically ch. 3 p. 49 of the Handbok of NIPA (National Income and Product Accounts), we read 

Property rights and assuming away bequest motives (the Old do no care about the Young). Capital of the previous period belongs to the Old, and since they will die at the and of old age, the finite-horizon transversality condition for utility maximization requires that either all assets have been consumed at the time of death, or that they have no utility-enhancing potential. Since the utility function reflects the "more is better" property, assets do have value as consumption down to the last bolt, and since there is no bequest motive, no utility from "leaving something for your children", it follows that the Old will consume all their capital, being utility maximizers. 

This is about headcount, not value-of-services. For 2nd-in-rank UK to nevertheless generate more income in terms of value, it should be the case that average fees/cost of living in UK is ~$64$% higher than in the USA. Otherwise, USA will be also the biggest exporter of education. This, without taking into account the size of each country's economy. The link mentions that Unesco's statistical data base provides further statistics. 

"Your solution" is the Future Value (FV) of the payments schedule as though you were saving money on $8\%$ interest calculated yearly, and made no withdrawals at all. So this value exists two years in the future, and not now. Your solution sends the payment schedule to a single point in the future. Laura says to the school "instead of paying $15,000$ now and $15,000$ one year from now to receive services up until the end of the 2nd year, it is the same to pay $33,696$ at the end of the second year" (assuming that the school operates indeed under an $8\%$ interest rate, in the sense that the school will have to borrow the money and at the end of the 2nd year repay them with interest. You will have save the money at the same interest and you will have the nominal amount needed). But the exercise asks for the Present Value (PV) of this payment schedule. It asks to bring the payment schedule to the single point that it is "now". Here, Laura says to the school "instead of the payment schedule of nominal value $30,000$ that you propose it is the same if I pay you now $28,889$" -because the school will receive $15,000$ one year earlier than planned and it will have the opportunity to save it at a $8\%$ interest rate. Both are legitimate concepts of course, they both calculate the value of a payment schedule spread out in time, if it were to be compacted into a single payment -but each calculates this value for a different point in time. 

It is my impression that there is an inconsistency here. If firms want to maximize $V(n)$ which is some "surplus revenue over costs" function, then surplus they will produce. Meaning, that this surplus/profits cannot be given to workers, in the form of wages, because wages are cost. It may be given as dividends or, say, end-year bonus, but in any case it won't be related to $n$. So we do not have $Y=wn$ but rather $Y = wn + d$, and the externality appears to break down. The $Y=wn$ relation is consistent with a "non-profit" organization, which would demand as much $n$ as needed in order to have zero profits. In such a case, the wage would be equal to the average product of labor, not the marginal one. 

A firm's Output $Y$ (in value-added terms, i.e. over and above the value of purchases of third-party services and materials) is distributed as reward to the factors of production. Denote $K$ the book value of the company's assets. Use the standard notation $L$ for payments to the labor/human capital input to production. Denote $r$ the capital rate of return as measured with respect to the book value of firm's capital and denote $w$ the average remuneration of human capital services. Then we have $$Y = rK + wL$$ Depending on the market, the industry, and a few other things, we can estimate $r^*$, the rate of return that the firm "should" have on average, if it should be judged as an efficient user of capital allocated to it, for given output and human capital costs. $r^*$ is usually estimated by what are the returns on the market and the industry (we do not go outside the industry since we recognize the existence of "asset specificity"). Associated with $r^*$ goes the efficient level of capital, $K^*$. So we also have $$Y = r^*K^* + wL$$ leading to $$rK = r^*K^* \implies r = r^*\frac {K^*}{K}$$ If we have that $$r < r^* \implies r^*\frac {K^*}{K} < r^* \implies K^* < K$$ and we can say with some certainty that the inequality does not show a tendency to change in the near future, then we can argue that the company does not make efficient use of the current amount of capital it appears to have, either due to "functional inefficiency" (how things are organized and work inside the company and in the delivery of of its business, a qualitative aspect), or due to plain under-utilization of the existing capital (a quantitative aspect). The "over-capitalization" story essentially assumes "functional efficiency" but it sees under-utilization of capital, and so it advocates the reduction of the capital/assets currently under the control of the company. To measure it we have the relation ($K_E=$ Excess Capital) $$ K_E = K - K^* = K- \frac {r}{r^*}K = \left (1-\frac {r}{r^*}\right)K$$ $r$ and $K$ is measured from the firms financial statement, while $r^*$ from Industry weighted averages.
