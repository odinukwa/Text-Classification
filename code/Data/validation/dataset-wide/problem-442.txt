Perhaps these names could be very specific so they don't speak about "oldest brother" but have a specific word for that. And perhaps that word depends on the gender of the speaker. And perhaps that word depends on the relative social statuses of the speaker (see "honorific languages"). And perhaps the word depends on the person's zodiacal sign and the year in which they were born (as years are named in many cultures and viewed as influential). So there might be 144 different names for a particular relative, based on which month and which year they were born in. So the person being interviewed might well name the individual fairly specifically, but an outsider trying to figure out or to use the description might find it nearly impossible. For example, I think of U.S. servicemen who learn Japanese from Japanese girlfriends: the problem is male speakers and female speakers will use different words. So perhaps the investigator is male and the witness is female. Or maybe the investigator is a middle-aged, married male and the witness is a young, single female. If he tries to ask anyone about the relationship he's given, they will totally misunderstand him. Thus it's not that the witness can't say, but that the investigator can't use the "name". (Oh, and perhaps actual names are viewed as sacred and only immediate family members actually know your name. Or perhaps the opposite: human names are profane -- there is only One Name. Everyone else uses relationships.) And we're not even getting into multiple uses of relationship words. "Hey brother, can you spare a dime?" The person is not your brother in the genetic sense. Similarly, I had an "aunt" and "uncle" growing up who were simply friends of my parents, and I know people who talk about "cousins" who are not cousins in the general sense of the word. 

on the plus side: almost everything that uses timezones would be simpler. specifically, when traveling or communicating across timezones. this includes reading things written in another timezone. notable examples include: 

pixelation basically, any simulation has a max resolution. at some point, you stop drawing discrete pixels, and just calculate the average effect of everything below that resolution as a continuous field of forces and probabilities. for example, if you wanted to simulate the solar system without calculating the position and velocity of every electron, then you would simply use an equation to compute the average position and velocity the planets and other large bodies. the pixelation limit of that simulation would be at the planet level and you couldn't break apart a planet to look at how it's internal components interact. if you want to "zoom in" on part of the earth and see animals running around, you need to increase your computing power substantially. the pixel limit of our universe appears to be sub-atomic particles (e.g. electrons), indicating that we live in a simulation that pixelates at around the size of an electron. you simply can not assign a location and velocity to an electron in any meaningful way because it is smaller than a "pixel" in the simulator that runs our universe. 

taunting it seems common for soldiers to expose their butt or genitals prior to a battle as a way of taunting the enemy (e.g. the pissing champion of meereen). if this tradition became so common as to be expected, then you might have soldiers simply leaving their butt exposed as a show of bravery (cf. the red barron painting a bright red target on his plane). 

This assumes that your teleporting doesn't magically push things aside to make room for your arrival. Get a bunch of metal cable, and create a grid of spools in the ceiling in a grid about a foot apart. Each cable will have a weight attached to it that, and is long enough to go from floor to ceiling. In the evening, you let the cables down so the entire interior of your shop has floor-to-ceiling cables. Depending on how the teleporting determines space, they either won't be able to port in, or they will port in and will be skewered with a cable in them. In the morning, you crank the cables back up into the ceiling. So you need to clarify two questions as well: 

I believe the instant you put something into one side of the portal, out comes out the other, as if you stepped through a doorway. Do you mean what happens if you turn off the portal while the object is halfway through when the portal closes? If you want to destroy something -- as in the game -- it's easier to open up one side of the portal high above the target and one side on the floor beneath the target and let the target fall repeatedly through until it reached terminal velocity, then close the portal, so the object crashes at high speed into the floor. Or open a portal high above the target and then open the other side under a very heavy object so that it crashes onto the target. 

once "the swarm" consumed a large red 3-armed smelly hairy thing, it would proceed to consume all large red 3-armed smelly hairy things before going dormant again. to take dogs as a model, perhaps "the overlords" like variety in their pets, and occasionally cull out any sub-species that becomes too common. looking specifically at "monsters inc", perhaps human children would eventually become accustomed to the appearance of a given monster and stop screaming. if your spawn required human child screams to survive, then being a novel (and therefore scary) shape would give them a competitive advantage. 

private property is generally simple. all people recognize the value of "i won't steal your stuff if you don't steal mine". conflict arises over shared resources (e.g. the air, the water, etc.). so, maybe the elves don't like the dragons flying over (and pooping on) their fields. maybe the dragons don't like the elves draining the rivers for irrigation. other resources can be seen as "shared". perhaps the elves view the forest as a "shared" resource they occasionally visit, but the dragons think they own the whole place. if either race could consistently control the land, then the dispute would end. but if the elves and dragons both regularly use the land with impunity, then it is de facto shared and conflict will continue. shared resource are particularly problematic when the two races use them in mutually exclusive ways. e.g. the elves want to clear land of trees to plant the crops they need, but the dragons want to grow trees which they need to build their nests. since both races view the land as a shared resource, and both races think they know the "right" way to use the land, conflict is likely to become intense. 

Actual naval warfare is constrained by a curved earth, air resistance, and the asymmetry of water and air. So aircraft carriers have a huge advantage over battleships, not because of swarms of small vehicles, per se, but because the small vehicles travel over the horizon. Similarly, submarines lurk under the surface and fire torpedoes that you can't really hit from a surface vessel. On the other hand, a laser in space can hit a distant target far faster than a physical projectile. Not to mention that carriers may become obsolete as hypersonic missiles and torpedoes are finally perfected. So maybe future battleships will launch these -- or maybe they'll all be launched from land bases and targeted via satellites. The ultimate space weapons are launched from enormous "vessels", where we might loosely define a huge device and an entire solar system as a "vessel". Look up Relativistic Weapons in the fascinating Exotic Weapons page. (The exotic weapons page is absolutely worth a read... be prepared to spend some time there.) These are the ultimate, unstoppable weapons for destroying entire planets. Small targets would be hard to hit with one, of course, so a swarm of small spaceships might take out your launcher, but if you get a first shot you'll destroy their planets with no chance of them defending. Lots of luck with them surviving in a bunch of little ships with their home planet(s) gone. Space is larger than the ocean. Even at some FTL speeds, it'll take you longer to get to a battle than the days or even weeks it takes a ship to cross the Pacific. Which tilts things towards larger ships, I would say. 

because merfolk are cheaper than robots and machines can travel faster than humans. imagine you want to colonize a planet that is 10 light-years away. first you send your generation ship, but it will take 1000 years to get there because the human body can't accelerate very fast without dying. meanwhile, you send a colonization kit at nearly light speed. it arrives in 20 years and starts building a space port for you. unfortunately, you can't afford to send an entire space port, so you just send some robots that use the native resources to build a space port and stock it with food and other supplies. you also can't afford to send enough robots to do all the mining, smelting, constructing, farming, etc. so the first thing your robots do is build more robots. it turns out that on planets suitable for life, the most accessible resources to a tiny space probe are organic molecules. so the "robots" your probe builds are effectively tiny plants which generate the energy you need to fuel more complex machines. it then builds animals that are smart enough to build your space port. those animals are humanoid so they are easier to relate to, but they are aquatic so that when your descendants arrive they can colonize the land while the merfolk continue to live happily in the sea. indeed, you can even genetically program the merfolk to desire to build space ports but hate the idea of actually leaving the sea personally. it's like "brave new world" meets "a for andromeda" 

Great ideas! Pretty heavy on diseases and biological explanations, so how about a few that are different? 

Self-hatred: Perhaps the vampires actually despise their own actions and what they have become. In an act of self-justification, they feel that if they are invited in that they have permission to do what they need to do. Sort of like a member of an organization that hazes initiates and justifies it by saying "That's what I went through when I was new". So the vampire thinks about their decision to allow entrance to the vampire that turned them, and justifies it: "It's not my fault. They bring this on themselves, as I brought it upon myself." Lack of power: Perhaps vampires really don't have any great strength, can't turn into mists or bats and fly, etc, etc. They're actually rather sickly except that they have fairly strong psychic powers. Not so strong as to be able to overpower someone who stands up to them with a clear mind, but strong enough to overcome the weak or clouded mind. Considering their strangeness, most people get a "bad feeling" about them, but those who are weak or inattentive enough to invite them in are weak enough to be overcome psychically. A test: Perhaps vampires can control some minds but not others. It's a genetic thing, like having allergies. The request may be anything unusual, not just entering a house, and it's a test to see if they can control the intended victim or not. So it might be, "Give me $100", or "Let me have your horse", if you're out in the middle of nowhere, but inside a home is a convenient place to commit vampiric crimes, so the house thing is traditional and useful. Drugs: Perhaps vampires have no psychic abilities at all, but rather rely on a psychotropic drug, and the request is a test of whether they were able to administer a sufficient dose. Administering it is an art (in the air, in food, etc), and you can't administer too much or the victim passes out in public, or perhaps dies and is toxic, so you need just enough to assure compliance, but not so much as to cause trouble or spoil the meal. Last, are you sure it's entering another's house uninvited. Wasn't the famous movie line about the victim entering the vampire's house of their own free will? 

1066~1440 CE before the normans conquered england in 1066-1072ce, the residents of england spoke a language called "old english", which is arguably more similar to modern german than modern english (e.g. Beowulf 700~1050ce). so, before 1066 you would have almost no chance of understanding anyone without significant study. after the normans conquered england, the conqueror's "old french" mixed with the commoner's "old english" to form a new simpler language we today call "english". that said, it took a few generations for the languages to mix, so in 1073 you would be just about as lost as 1065, but by 1300's things would start sounding familiar (e.g. the canterbury tales from 1386). still, without modern printing, dialects varied widely between towns, classes and generations. in fact, a typical uneducated serf would have a gruff german vocabulary you would consider rudimentary, while an "old money" noble conversation would sound closer to french and might actually include a few french or latin words. it wasn't until the printing press was invented in 1440 that the english language started to unify and stabilize into what we would recognize as "modern english" (e.g. asop's fables from 1484, typeface notwithstanding). so, listening to an educated person speak in 1450 london would be almost perfectly intelligible. you might need a few days to get used to their accent, word choice and world view, but the vocabulary and grammar would be perfectly serviceable to discuss most topics. futher reading: $URL$ side notes: you must keep in mind that the culture of pre-modern england was very different from today. on the one hand, without mass transportation, most people lived their entire lives within 40km of their home. with no dictionaries, they expected to have difficulty communicating with anyone who lived more than one village away. as such, they would probably be more adept at bridging the dialect gap than you. in a big city like london, you could probably find someone you could understand quickly. on the other hand, rural strangercide was much more common, and they might just kill you rather than try to figure out why you left your previous home (presumably not by choice...). at the very least, once the local lord determined you did not belong to any other lord, he would probably try to force you to work his land rather than accept the preposterous premise that your knowledge could be more valuable than your muscles. even today, you can see the upper/lower class french/german split in distinctions like a restaurant's "beef" (french bœuf) vs a farmer's "cow" (german kuh). or lower class german expressions like "blow up" vs upper class terminology such as "explode". 

I upvoted @Mormacil's answer, but let me give you an analogy that you may find useful. In some countries, you can refer to a building by a street address: 1854 Jackson Lane. You could find Jackson Lane and go in the correct direction and somewhere adjacent to 1853 and 1855 you'll find 1854. 

First, a great idea. The problem is the practical issues, as you suspect. Besides everything decaying/breaking/exploding -- as mentioned in other answers -- everything would be covered in a thick coating of dust. Not to mention that people who fell asleep in bathtubs, pools, the ocean -- or even on the beach -- would drown and people who fell asleep outdoors might well die from the cold, be eaten by animals (unless they, too slept), or be sunburned beyond recognition. And security cameras all over the world would have recorded either sleeping people or emptiness for as long as they were powered. (Probably overwriting in a loop, so you'd only have the last few days or weeks.) 

This would be called sports. This caste would become professional athletes. In one sense, the original Olympic Games reflected preparation for war: hammer throw, spear throw, wrestling, running, jumping, shot put (strength), etc. Add more modern martial sports like archery, fencing, shooting, biathlon, etc. Add in orienteering (quickly moving over terrain with a map and compass), and more abstracted martial activities. Perhaps sports are restricted only to this caste. Perhaps these sports are restricted only to this caste and other castes only participate in others (badminton, baseball, soccer, table tennis, bowling). Or perhaps anyone can participate in these sports but only clans within this caste compete in the Olympics. It would be oriented towards the level of weapons that are known. If your society has firearms, target shooting, skeet shooting, paintball competition, etc, would directly contribute to military prowess. But being in great physical shape with high stamina, endurance of pain, eye-hand coordination, etc, would give you a huge advantage over more sedentary people. I'd have more problems trying to imagine a society in which no killings occur. Not even accidental (manslaughter)? Really? No one dropping something out a window onto someone's head? No one pushing someone in jest and the person falls down the stairs to their death? No one using the wrong ingredients in a food dish and accidentally poisoning someone? Not one single person getting angry and stabbing someone with a kitchen knife in a moment of passion? I can conceive of a world where murder is extremely rare and warfare doesn't happen, but...
