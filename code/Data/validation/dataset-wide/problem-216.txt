That's an interesting question. I think for the children it would be a lot less unpleasant than current educational regimes - especially if your parents are tiger-mom types. My impression of your drug is that it would create monomaniacal focus, submission to authority, contentment and perhaps even happiness when studying, and an intense curiosity about the world. One important question to consider is why administration of this drug is not continued with adults? Any nation with hyper focused, obedient adults would have a GDP growth rate that would be the envy of China. This drug would also increase the effectiveness of the military tremendously. Most importantly, a leader who instituted a policy of administering obedience drug to all citizens would never lose his position of power. Assuming there is some mechanism which makes administration of the drug to adults impossible, individualism-oriented societies (like the USA) would generally find the administration of the drug to children abhorrent, despite it making for objectively happier childhoods. I suspect it would be more popular in societies which believe that childhood should be a period of very hard study such as China and Singapore. There would of course be a massive race for the development of a similar drug which works on adults. Billions would certainly be spent on that. It would be a dream drug for say, North Korea. The use of this drug would kick off a technological singularity of a sort. Any generation given this drug would be vastly better educated than unaugmented peers. For a variety of reasons, this increased education level would appear to casual observers to be a significant boost to intelligence. There is currently a large cultural gulf between people with high and low levels of education. They vote differently, worship differently, consume very different media, and do different things with their time. People with more education are healthier, wealthier, and live longer. What I'm trying to say is that I don't think people who had drugged childhoods and people who did not would have much in common. This would create huge societal divisions. In particular, the first generation to have the drug would not be able to identify very well with anyone older than themselves. This would be a generational rift like we have never seen. People who had to skip parts of their childhood often maintain an increased level of playfulness and interest in childish things for the rest of their lives. I would expect this to be the case for the adults who were drugged as children. This would also be a nice twist on the expectation that these kids would be over-educated automatons as adults, but instead are often found playing with toys or playing tag with each other. 

All of the workable defense strategies I've read thus far assume the space bees are in a tightly packed formation. There is no particular reason for this to be the case, and since they are not idiots I am going to assume they spread themselves over the maximum volume possible. A relatively small sacrifice in delta V will result in very large fleet dispersals meaning that no nuclear weapon will be able to kill more than a single bee, and clouds of dust or sand will not be large or dense enough to materially affect the fleet during transit. The OP says the fully fueled mass of the bees is 3141kg. Using this online calculator $URL$ an 80,000 ISP, and 70,000 m/s delta V suggests an unfueled mass of 2870 kg. That gives me a 7E12 joule energy. (i.e. 7 terajoule or 1.6 KT) The total energy of the fleet will be 7E20 joules or 170,000 MT. The bolide which killed off the dinosaurs is estimated to have had 130,000,000 MT of energy, so the bees would have almost 1,000 times less energy if they all get through our defenses. This handy calculator gives you the effects of an individual impactor. $URL$ projectile diameter is 2.76m, density is 261 kg/m^3, velocity is 70 km/s, angle is 90 degrees. The one problem it has is that it assumes an impactor tensile strength of a natural material, whereas these impactors are made from carbon nanotubes. I don't know how to calculate how atmospheric frictional heat loadings affect the material, nor what kinds of tensile stresses result from the atmospheric traversal, but I think it is safe to say the impactors would penetrate to a lower altitude than indicated in this calculator. But since the calculator has the impactor detonating into a fireball at 121,000 meters altitude, I think it's very unlikely that it would reach a low enough altitude to markedly affect the surface before it detonated into a fireball. The other noteworthy takewaway from this calculator is that the fireball energy is only 1/7th the kinetic energy of the impactor. (Presumably the rest is lost to friction prior to this point.) This puts the attack in a very different light. Essentially all of the energy of a fleet attack which was well distributed across one half of the Earth would go toward heating the atmosphere, producing little or no effects on the ground other than loud noises and bright flashes of light. In order to produce any truly dangerous effect, the attack would have to be focused. If the bees fire a dense stream of impactors at selected targets, they can produce deeper penetrations. The initial impactors would produce a partially evacuated shockwave in their wake, through which the following bees could travel with less energy lost to the atmosphere as friction, resulting in lower detonation altitudes (possibly not detonating until impacting with the surface). Also, the thermal flash effects would be concentrated in one area, resulting in arbitrarily high thermal loads in that vicinity. Potential strategic impact sites might include the Yellowstone super volcano (possibly requiring the entire fleet to cause any likely volcanic effect here?), nuclear reactors, flash heating attacks on drought afflicted forests in order to cause massive firestorms and nuclear winter effects (nuclear winters rely entirely on sending smoke into the stratosphere via a firestorm), flash heating of crop lands in order to create famine conditions, bioweapon research labs (human diseases are pretty bad, but just as horrible would be the effects of uncontrolled release of novel crop diseases), and oil refining and storage facilities (cripples our economy and contributes smoke to stratosphere). One problem with focused attacks is that they make it easier for the Earth to degrade the attack (with nuclear detonations in space and sand cloud attacks). The goal would be to degrade the nanotube structures to make them break up higher in the atmosphere. The higher the altitude at which the impactor breaks up in a fireball, the less the damage to the surface. I think the bees would be smarter to invest in larger and denser but fewer impactors. Carbon nanotubes might be good material for the outer skin (I'm not sure) but the impactors should carry a payload of natural (non-explosive) uranium, tungsten, or other extremely dense material. The impactors should be shaped like arrows, not like pods. They need to lose as little energy as possible on atmospheric friction, and density is the key to this. The impactors should come in a variety of sizes. Small impactors for nuclear power plants and ICBM silos. A super large impactor for Yellowstone and other super volcanos. If I were the aliens, I would generally ignore the cities and concentrate on killing the populace via secondary effects such as climate change, famine, infrastructure collapse, radiation contamination, and disease. But to answer your exact question: The way to protect the Earth from a dispersed attack is probably to do nothing. The way to protect from a focused attack is probably, like people have said, nuclear missiles and clouds of sand focused on points in space where the bees are converging. 

Another option beyond one or more sunshades located at the L1 lagrange point would possibly be a nuclear winter type of effect. The aliens would need to continually seed the stratosphere with smoke particles. If they choose to build space elevators, they could add a very large burner at the right altitude. Otherwise they could maybe use hydrogen balloons tethered to hoses. Presumably they would use pure oxygen as fuel for their burner because the atmosphere has high levels of methane and thus, presumably almost zero oxygen. 

Transhumanism will provide the ability to create not just new races, but entire new species of humanity (descendants of humans who are unable to reproduce with traditional humans without the assistance of technology). Development of these new species will be driven by cultural values. In fact, people with strongly held ideologies (religious zealots, fanatical communists, etc.) will seek to encode these ideologies into their offspring. If a subculture values obedience to elders, they will encode obedience into the genome of their offspring. If a subculture values pacifism, they will remove the ability to experience rage from their offspring. Clearly, these new races and species will have very strong fundamental disagreements about a wide variety of core beliefs. 

This is a cool idea and I can't think of anything that would get in the way of glaciers grinding up and moving debris just the way you describe. This would collect in glacial moraines. $URL$ The debris would likely contain everything in the city. Miners would probably use levers to move boulders and break up compacted mixtures of materials.
