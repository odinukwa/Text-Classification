Many proofs with elementary geometry methods are replaced nowadays with analytic geometry and calculus. Remember, Newton wrote his Principia without explicit use of calculus. No one uses his obsolete arguments in this form anymore. EDIT. To see that epicycle is the same as a trigonometric series, use complex numbers. The uniform motion of a point about the center is $Ae^{i\omega_1t}$. In the case of one epicycle, we have a deferent and epicycle; the motion has the form is expressed in the form $Ae^{i\omega_1t}+Be^{i\omega_2t}$, the center of the epicycle is $Ae^{i\omega_1t}$, it is moving with uniform speed on the deferent. The planet moves around this point with angular speed $\omega_2$. By the way, in this notation the famous theorem of Apollonius "on the equivalence of excentric and epicycle description" says exactly that the addition of complex numbers is commutative:-) In more complicated models, more than two terms is required. In the modern theory of the Moon, we have several hundred such summands. The summands other than the first one are traditionally called "inequalities". The first two are due to Ptolemy. The third and fourth to Brahe, and so on. You can see the whole series in the book by Meeus cited above. EDIT2.

The answer to the question 1 is yes, and this is called Pringsheim's theorem: For a series with non-negative coefficients the singular point which is closest to the origin lies on the positive ray. Thus, if the series converges for all positive $z$, it converges everywhere and the function is entire. (Your estimate $f(z)\leq e^{z^2}$ is not needed here). 

Usually this argument is justified like this. First. The critical values of $f^n$ are the forward orbits of critical points. This follows from the chain rule. On the set of normality, forward orbits of critical points either tend to cycles, or lie on some closed curves (in singular domains). Therefore there is always a simply connected open set $V$ on the set of normality that is disjoint of these forward orbits. Second. This implies that all inverse branches of all iterates are well defined and holomorphic on $V$. Third. These branches, all together make a normal family because they avoid a large set (Julia set). The limits of sequences of these branches must be constant if there are no singular domains, because the inverse orbits tend to $J$ and $J$ has no interior. There is an exceptional orbit if $V$ is in the singular domain. This argument was already used by Fatou. EDIT. To address your questions: that preimages of $V$ under different branches of the same $f^{-n}$ are disjoint is clear. For all preimages under $f^{-m}$ and $f^{-n}$ to be disjoint $V$ should not be in an invariant component. You can always find such $V$, unless all components are comletely invariant. In this last case the components are non-singular, the dynamics inside such component is clear, and again you can choose such $V$. At the time of Fatou, the existence of singular components was doubtful, but of course Fatou knew that there is such possibility, and always took them into account in his proofs. The term "singular domain" belongs to Fatou. That they can be actually be present, Siegel showed in 1944. In other words, Fatou knew the classification of possible periodic components but he did not know whether all possibilities of this classification can be actually present. He also did not know whether wandering domains can exist or not, but this does not affect the argument we discuss. 

It will be better if you write the definition of your matrix in a more readable way. From what you wrote, it seems that your matrix satisfies $M(k,k+1)M(k+1,k)\geq 0$. With this condition, all eigenvalues are real. In general the eigenvalues of a Jacobi (3-diagonal) matrix will not change if you replace both off diagonal elements $M(k,k+1)$ and $M(k+1,k)$ by square root of their product. So if the product of off diagonal elements is positive you obtain a symmetric matrix. Ref. R. Gantmakher and M. Krein, Oscillation matrices..., MR1908601. EDIT. One way to prove this is indicated in the comment below by Anthony Quas. Another way (used in Gantmakher and Krein) is to write explicitly the characteristic polynomial, and to notice that off-diagonal elements enter only in the form of products $M(k,k+1)M(k+1,k)$. One more remark. This argument shows that there always exists an explicitly written quadratic form with respect to which our operator is Hermitean. If the products of off diagonal elements are all positive, this quadratic form is positive definite, and we have all real eigenvalues. But even if the products are not all positive, and the quadratic form is indefinite, one can sometimes obtain existence of SOME real eigenvalues by using a theorem of Pontryagin on Hermitean operators with respect to indefinite form. 

No (if I decode your abbreviation "psh" correctly, as "plurisubharmonic"). Let $n=1$. Take a function $u(x,y)=0, x<0, u(x,u)=1, x>0$. It is locally integrable, but it is not a difference of subharmonic functions. In general, subharmonic functions are sort of "almost continuous". 

But of course any proof requires some topology. The standard proof requires Fundamental theorem of Algebra, this proof requires existence of a minimum. 

Yes, $f=x$ almost everywhere wrt $P$. Consider the push-forward measure $\mu=f_*P$ (in probability, it is also called the distribution of $f$). It is defined as $\mu(E)=P(f^{-1}(E))$. This $\mu$ is a probability measure on $C$. Your condition becomes $$\int_C d\mu=x,\quad (1)$$ and this implies that $\mu$ is an atom at $x$. EDIT. This is a special case of a theorem of Bauer (see, for example Phelps, Lectures on Choquet's theorem, Proposition 1.4). Let $X$ be a non-empty compact convex set in a locally convex space, and $x\in X$. Then $x$ is an extreme point if and only if the point mass at $x$ is the unique measure for which (1) holds. Of course, you did not say that $C$ is bounded, but the reduction to this case is easy.

There is a theory of conformal map for circular polygons (polygons bounded by arcs of circles). But in this case, instead of an integral in the Schwarz-Christoffel formula, you obtain a linear differential equation. In the case of a circular triangle, the equation is hypergeometric and you have an explicit representation of your mapping. The paper of Harmer and Martin mentioned in the previous answer deals mainly with the case of a triangle. The most comprehensive treatment of triangles is in the second volume of Caratheodory's textbook on complex variables, and in other books on hypergeometric functions. The case of quadrilateral is the simplest case when there is no explicit formula. It was subject of much research. See, for example, arXiv:1110.2696, arXiv:1111.2296, and references in these papers. 

First of all, there is a general theory (due to Chebyshev) on the best uniform approximation of ANY continuoius function $f$ by polynomials of degree at most $d$ on an interval. It describes the polynomial of the best approximation, which is unique. In Chebyshev's polynomials, $f=x^n$ and $d=n-1$. You are asking about $f=x^n$ and some given $d<n$. I do not recommend to read Chebyshev himself on this but Akhiezer, Lectures on approximation theory. Now, the case when $d=n-2$ was worked our explicitly by Zolotarev, Chebyshev's student, in terms of elliptic functions. When $d$ is smaller than that, only some general facts about the polynomials of best approximation are known, but I don't think anyone has written an explicit exact expression for the polynomial or for the error. 

If your $f$ is one-to-one, make the change of the variable in your integral $y_i=f(x_i)$. You will obtain a new measure $\mu_1$, also with compact support, and your $\tilde\mu$ will be the ordinary Fourier transform of this new measure $\mu_1$. 

It is clear that $f(D)$ is connected. If $D$ is the unit disc, then every closed set whose complement is connected can be exceptional. Let $F$ be a closed set with connected complement containing at least 2 points. If $C\backslash D$ is not simply commented, then the universal covering map $f:D\to C\backslash F$ takes every value infinitely many times, and does not take values in $F$. If $C\backslash F$ is simply connected, construction is easier. If $F$ is one point, again we have easy examples. Same happens when $D$ is any simply connected set, other that $C$, by the Riemann mapping theorem. So the answer to all your questions is "yes" if $D$ is simply connected but different from $C$. If $E=C\backslash D$ is a finite set, then the number of exceptional values at every point of $E$ is at most one, and these exceptional values can be arbitrarily prescribed. So we can obtain any finite set of cardinality at most that of $E$. If $D$ is a complement of a Cantor set $E$, then the answer is more complicated and not all possibilities were studied. Carleson gave an example of a cantor $E$, or zero capacity such that every analytic function outside $E$, for which $E$ is singular, can omit at most 5 values, and 5 is best possible for this $E$.
