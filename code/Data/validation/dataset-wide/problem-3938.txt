Here are two constructions, showing that the expectation of the min can get down to around $1+1/\sqrt{n}$, and on the other hand can get up to a value approaching $2$ as $n\to\infty$. Maybe someone can do better! Let the random variables be $X_1, X_2,\dots, X_n$. (1) Aiming to make the expected minimum small; the idea is to let each value occur once, with a small perturbation to achieve the required probability that any two variables are the same. Fix $p>0$ ($p$ will get small as $n$ gets large). Let $\tilde{X}_1, \dots, \tilde{X}_n$ be a uniform permutation of $\{1,\dots, n\}$. Independently, let $Y$ be drawn uniformly from $\{1,\dots,n\}$. Finally (and independently of $(\tilde{X}_i)$ and $Y$), choose $B_1, B_2, \dots, B_n$ to be independent and each taking value $1$ with probability $p$, and $0$ with probability $1-p$. Now define $X_i$ by setting \begin{equation*} X_i=\begin{cases}\tilde{X}_i& \text{ if } B_i=0\\ Y&\text{ if } B_i=1\end{cases}. \end{equation*} If we choose $p$ such that $p^2 + 2p(1-p)/n = 1/n$, then it's easy to check that for each pair $i,j$, the variables $X_i$ and $X_j$ are equal with probability $1/n$. (Namely, $X_i=X_j$ whenever $B_i=B_j=1$, or $B_i=1, B_j=0$ with $Y=\tilde{X}_j$, or $B_i=0, B_j=1$ with $Y=\tilde{X}_i$.) From this it's easy to get (using symmetry) that all the pairwise distributions are as required. The relevant $p$ is around $1/\sqrt{n}$. Then the probability that the minimum is 1 is approximately $1-p$, and more generally the distribution of the minimum is approximately geometric with parameter $1-p$, and so with mean $1/(1-p)$. Overall we obtain that the expected minimum is $1+1/\sqrt{n}$ plus smaller order terms. (2) Aiming to make the expected minimum large; the idea is to let each value occur either 0 or 2 times, again with a small perturbation to get the pairwise distributions precisely right. For convenience let $n$ be even. Let $Y_1, Y_2, \dots, Y_{n/2}$ be $n/2$ distinct values chosen uniformly at random from $\{1,2,\dots,n\}$. Now let $\tilde{X}_1, \dots, \tilde{X}_n$ be a uniform permutation of $Y_1, Y_1, Y_2, Y_2, Y_3, Y_3, \dots, Y_{n/2}, Y_{n/2}$. So each value occurs either 0 or 2 times in the sequence $(\tilde{X}_i)$. The marginal distributions are correct, but the pairwise distributions are not quite correct; we have $\tilde{X}_i=\tilde{X}_j$ with probability $1/(n-1)$, while we want this probability to be $1/n$. To correct this, let $Z_1, \dots, Z_n$ be a uniform permutation of $\{1,2,\dots, n\}$. Now with probability $1/n$, let $X_i=Z_i$ for all $i$, and with probability $1-1/n$, let $X_i=\tilde{X}_i$ for all $i$. Again it's not hard to check that the pairwise distributions are correct. Now the probability that 1 appears in the sequence is approximately $1/2$; more generally, the distribution of the min of the sequence is approximately geometric with probability $1/2$ (since the numbers of occurrences of $1,2,3,\dots$ are approximately independent). The expectation of the min is then $2+o(1)$ as $n\to\infty$. Looking to improve this: note that to get the pairwise distributions right, the number of occurrences of any value $k$ should have mean approximately $1$ and variance approximately $1$ as $n\to\infty$. However, maybe we could improve on construction (2) by one in which the number of occurrences of $1,2,3,\dots$ are not asymptotically independent; again, to get the pairwise distributions right, they have to be asymptotically uncorrelated but this does not imply independence, so maybe by playing around one could get it so that, say, the number of occurrences of 1 and the number of occurrences of 2 tend to be 0 simultaneously (which will help to push up the expected minimum). 

Tan (The group of rational points on the unit circle, Math. Mag. 69 (1996), 163-171) proved that the group of rational points on the unit circle modulo torsion is isomorphic to infinitely many copies of $\mathbb Z$. I have given a couple of references to related articles in Kreise und Quadrate modulo $p$, Math. Semesterber. 47 (2000), 51-73. 

For irreducible cubics, the answer is provided by cyclotomy: cubic extensions with square discriminants are cyclic, hence cyclotomic. Computing the possible discriminants for reducible cubics seems at least feasible. For general polynomials, I predict trouble ahead. In the 1930s, Udo Wegner tried to prove results in the direction of "if the discriminant of an irreducible polynomial looks like the discriminant of a polynomial with Galois group G, then it must have Galois group G" (I think G was the Galois group of binomial extensions generated by $x^n-a$), but I would not trust any of his results without proving them myself. He wrote one article together with Reichardt, whose results can be trusted: 

I'm interested in the following symmetric functions $s_k: \mathbb{R}_+^{k}\mapsto\mathbb{R_+}$: \begin{align*} s_k(x_1,x_2,\dots, x_k)&= \int\limits_{0=t_0<t_1<\dots<t_{k-1}<t_k=1} e^{-(t_1-t_0) x_1} e^{-(t_2-t_1)x_2}\dots e^{-(t_k-t_{k-1})x_k}dt_1 \dots dt_{k-1} \\ &=\sum_{i=1}^k \frac{e^{-x_i}} {\displaystyle\prod_{\substack{j=1,\dots,n\\ j\ne i}}(x_j-x_i)} \end{align*} The formula on the second line holds whenever the $x_i$ are all distinct; however it becomes degenerate if $x_i=x_j$ for some $i\ne j$. Question: is there some "nice" pattern for the closed form expressions one obtains when some of the $x_i$ coincide? (Examples below.) [ One motivation: consider a continuous-time Markov chain, with state space $\{1,2,3,\dots\}$, with rate $q_{ij}$ of jumping from state $i$ to state $j$ for $i\ne j$, and total rate $\lambda_i=\sum_{j\ne i} q_{ij}$ of leaving state $i$. Suppose the chain starts in state $1$ at time $0$. Consider the event that during the time-interval $[0,1]$, the chain follows precisely the path $1\to2\to\dots\to (k-1)\to k$ and then stays in state $k$ until the end of the interval (making $k-1$ jumps in all). This event has probability $q_{12}\dots q_{(k-1)k}s_k(\lambda_1, \dots, \lambda_k)$. ] Anyway: everything is nice and smooth and closed-form expressions for cases with repeated entries can straightforwardly be derived (using, say, L'HÃ´pital or whatever) - however the details appear to get messy quite quickly. I'm wondering if there is some convenient or systematic way to write those expressions (other than just calculating each case). For example $s_2(x, y)=(e^{-x}-e^{-y})/(y-x)$, and then $s_2(x, x)=e^{-x}$. Taking e.g. $k=4$, we get (I think) \begin{align*} s_4(x,x,y,y)&=\frac{2(e^{-x}-e^{-y})}{(x-y)^3}+\frac{(e^{-x}+e^{-y})}{(x-y)^2} \\ s_4(x,x,x,y)&=\frac{e^{-y}-e^{-x}}{(x-y)^3}-\frac{e^{-y}}{(x-y)^2}+ \frac{e^{-y}}{2(x-y)} \\ s_4(x,y,z,z)&=\frac{e^{-x}}{(z-x)^2(y-x)} + \frac{e^{-y}}{(z-y)^2(x-y)} \\ &\,\,\,\,\,\,\,+e^{-z}\left\{\frac{(z-x)+(z-y)+(z-x)(z-y)+z^2}{(z-x)^2(z-y)^2}\right\}. \end{align*} I'm aware that these things can be written in terms of multiple integrals with gamma densities; for example, if $k=k_1+\dots+k_m$ and there are $k_i$ arguments $x_i$ for each $i$, then I think \begin{equation*} s_k(\dots)=\int\limits_{0=t_0<t_1<\dots<t_{m-1}<t_m=1} \prod_{i=1}^m \left\{\frac{(t_i-t_{i-1})^{k_i-1}}{(k_i-1)!} e^{-(t_i-t_{i-1})x_i}\right\}dt_1\dots dt_{m-1}, \end{equation*} but I'm not sure that leads anywhere particularly nice. Perhaps (beguiled by the beautiful form in the case of all $x_i$ distinct) I'm looking for something unreasonable, and these things just are what they are. Then again maybe someone has something nice to point out! 

Let ${\mathfrak p}$ be a prime ideal, $\sigma$ the associated substitution in $K/k$, which is not uniquely determined, ${\mathfrak T}$ the inertia group, and $e$ its order. Set $$ \chi({\mathfrak p}^\nu) = \frac{1}{e} \sum_{\tau \in {\mathfrak T}} \chi(\sigma^\nu\tau)\ , $$ which is the mean of all possible values. Then $$ \log L(s,\chi) = \sum_{{\mathfrak p},\nu} \frac{\chi({\mathfrak p}^\nu)}{\nu N{\mathfrak p}^{\nu s}} $$ is the complete definition also for divisors of the discriminant. $L(s,\chi)$ can be written as usual as a product of the form $$ L(x,\chi) = \prod_{\mathfrak p} \frac{1}{|E-N{\mathfrak p}^{-s} A_{\mathfrak p}|}, $$ where $A_{\mathfrak p}$ is a certain matrix attached to ${\mathfrak p}$ (which may be $0$) and only has roots of units as characteristic roots. 

I did not want to answer this question at first, but now that we end up with teacher bashing let me put in my 2 cents. Facts first: I teach kids between 13 and 19 (grade 7 to 13), and I do know some maths; so do my colleagues, although they know somewhat less than I do, of course. I have no problems explaining why we add or multiply fractions the way we do, or why the product rule holds. I think it is idiotic to assume that problems with simple arithmetic magically disappear when we start explaining the mathematics behind it, and in this respect there is no difference between the addition of fractions or the product rule: your explanations reach only 5 % of the class, the rest will patiently wait for the recipe. In fact I think the problems start when instead of teaching children how to add an substract, we try to make them understand why the algorithms work. I don't think I cared a lot about the fine points of the decimal system when I was 11, and I don't think that today's kids do. Problems with calculators set in when the kids are 13 upwards; simple arithmetic is not supposed to be trained because the calculators can do it. By the time they graduate from high school (gymnasium in Germany), my students can form the derivative of $e^{\sin x}$ without problems, but many of them have problems if they have to manipulate $\frac1x - \frac1{x-1}$. The main problem I am having with our current approach (over here) is that, at least in my neck of the woods, being able to use the calculator (TI 83) is compulsory for graduating. So yes, the problem is not the existence of the calculator, it is the teaching; but: the curriculum is designed in such a way that basic arithmetic plays only a minor role, and the reason why it is designed that way is -- the calculator. 

Since the number of visits has geometric distribution, it's enough to find its expected value. Here is one approach: since you can solve the one-dimensional case, treat the two-dimensional case as two "interleaved" one-dimensional walks, one north-south, the other east-west. Let's say $p_1$ is the probability of north, $p_2$ is the probability of south. Then at each step, we do a step from the north-south walk with probability $p_1+p_2$ and a step from the east-west walk with probability $p_3+p_4$; each step of the north-south walk is north with probability $p_1/(p_1+p_2)$ and south with probability $p_2/(p_1+p_2)$. So then the probability of being back at the origin at time $N$ is the sum over $m$ of $P(X=m) P(\text{north-south walk at 0 after $m$ steps})P(\text{east-west walk at 0 after $N-m$ steps})$ where $X$ is Binomial$(N, p_1+p_2)$. Sum over $N$ to get the total expected number of visits. I don't see that this will give you a closed-form answer, but it may at least make it easier to compute and/or obtain bounds. 

I doubt that we know that Thales "certainly knew" the concept of a planar angle. All we know about pre-Euclidean mathematics is basically based on histories written long after Euclid. There is no concept of angle in Sumerian or Old Babylonian mathematics. The division of the circle into 360 degrees came into being well after 700 BC in Chaldean astronomy. Of course the Babylonians (like Thales) knew what a right angle was, but they didn't even have a word for it. 

You can find an elementary proof in Un thÃ©orÃ¨me arithmÃ©tique sur les coniques by Trygve Nagell in Ark. f. Mat. 2 (1952). This is a quadratic analogue of what Birch called Heegner's Lemma, which deals with the solvability of certain quartic equations. 

The key word is "percolation" and the literature is vast. Some good general references: Percolation (2nd ed.). Geoffrey Grimmett, Springer-Verlag, 1999 Percolation and disordered systems. Geoffrey Grimmett, lectures notes from the Saint-Flour summer school, 1996. Available from $URL$ , no.13 in the list of preprints. Percolation. BÃ©la BollobÃ¡s and Oliver Riordan, Cambridge University Press, 2006 (terminology: broadly speaking, "random graph" tends to be used in a situation where there is no underlying geometric or spatial structure, while "percolation" tends to be used where there is some sort of underlying lattice or regular structure. But this is not a precise distinction and usage varies). 

$A(x)=\frac{1-x}{1-(1-p)x}$ for $p\in(0,1)$. Then all the coefficients $a_k$ are non-zero, and in fact $G=1-A$ is the probability generating function of the geometric distribution with parameter $p$ (taking values in $\{1,2,3,\dots\}$). $A(x)=1-\left[1-(1-x)^{1/n}\right]^n$ for $n=1,2,3,\dots$. Then the non-zero coefficients are $a_0$ and $a_n, a_{n+1}, a_{n+2},\dots$. $A(x)=(1-x^n)^{1/n}$ for $n=1,2,3,\dots$. Then the non-zero coefficients are $a_0, a_n, a_{2n}, a_{3n}, \dots$. 

One of the first factorization algorithms beyond trial division and Fermat's method was CFRAC: from the continued fraction expansion of $\sqrt{n}$ one computed solutions $x^2 - ny^2 = d^2$ and then had the (possibly trivial) factor $\gcd(n,x-d)$ of $n$. It is the father of the quadratic seive method. 

There are a lot of results in elementary number theory that can be proved with the quadratic reciprocity law. In such a proof you usually have to invert some Jacobi symbol $(a/b)$ and then reduce the numerator modulo the denominator. For number fields that are not Euclidean with respect to some simple map you have a problem if you want to follow this route (the same goes for applications of quadratic and higher residues to cryptography, although this is mostly a theoretical business). In principle, Dedekind-Hasse will also do the trick in some cases. If the ring of integers you're interested in is not Euclidean for the canonical norm, the first idea is to modify it. You could give prime ideals a different weight (weighted norms), or allow division chains in which the norm does not necessarily get smaller in every step (k-stage Euclidean rings), or try some version of Dedekind-Hasse. But if (given a pair $(a,b)$ of elements in a ring) you want to make the norm of $ka-bq$ small, you need more than just the knowledge that a suitable $k$ exists: you need a method for finding $k$ (in addition to finding $q$), perhaps by showing that you can select it from a finite set of elements with bounded norm or something similar. Edit. The Euclidean algorithm is closely related to continued fractions, and the latter are routinely used for doing calculations of units and ideal class groups of real quadratic number fields. For number fields that admit a Euclidean algorithm, something similar can be done: Hurwitz and Mathews worked out a theory of continued fractions over the Gaussian integers, and people like Arwin, Trinks, Degel, Lakein, Stein etc. generalized this to complex Euclidean number fields and used it for computing units and class numbers. I am not aware of too many recent contributions in this direction, but a short search has at least revealed D. Fried, Reduction theory over quadratic imaginary fields, T. Number Theory 2005. 

Let $X_1, X_2, X_3,\dots$ be an i.i.d. sequence of random variables with finite mean. Write $S_n=X_1+X_2+\dots+X_n$. Let $N$ be a non-negative integer-valued random variable with finite mean. $N$ may not be independent of the sequence $(X_i)$. Is it necessarily the case that $S_N$ has finite mean? Of course, it's true if $N$ is independent of the sequence $(X_i)$. Then $E(S_N)=E(N)E(X_1)$. It's still true if $N$ is a stopping time for the sequence $(X_i)$. It's also true if the $X_i$ have finite variance. Then for any $c>E(X_i)$, the quantity $R_c=\sup(S_n-cn)$ has finite mean, and $E(S_N)\leq cE(N)+E(R_c)$. 

Hi Nathanael. The answer to Q1 will be $O(1)$. For concreteness consider the model with i.i.d. exponential weights at each site (the case with geometric weights at each site should also be fine but the geodesics are not unique so it's slightly messier). The path $\gamma_n(\alpha)$ converges almost surely to a path $\gamma(\alpha)$ as $n\to\infty$ (a "semi-infinite geodesic in direction $\alpha$"). So the question reduces to looking at the intersection of $\gamma(\alpha)$ and $\gamma(\beta)$. (The same behaviour should be seen across a wide class of models but showing that rigorously could be a challenge). Coupier ( $URL$ ) is a starting point for results and references concerning existence and uniqueness of such semi-infinite geodesics. Actually one could certainly say some specific things about the law of the intersection of the two semi-infinite geodesics (in an exactly solvable model like the i.i.d. exponential weight case). The joint law of the geodesics in two different directions from the same point is very closely related to the equilibrium of an appropriately defined two-type particle system. In this case the relevant particle system would be a certain type of process like the Hammersley process, but in discrete time and space and with "fluid" rather than discrete particles. Eric Cator and I have done some work relating joint laws of geodesics to two-type equilibria in this way recently - it is not written up yet but I would be delighted to discuss. The closest thing on paper might be Eric's article with Leandro Pimentel at $URL$ . The kind of calculations one could do concerning the two-type equilibria might resemble those done for the TASEP by Amir, Angel and Valko in $URL$ (which make use of a queueing-type representation for the multi-type equilibrium of the kind that Pablo Ferrari and I developed in $URL$ ). 

Numbers with this property belong to the set of normal numbers. All known normal numbers are "constructed"; it is not known whether a single "natural" number (square roots of nonsquares, pi, e, logarithms of integers $> 1$) is normal or not. It is believed, however, that these numbers are in fact normal (even independently from the chosen base), and thus have the desired property. 

Here $(q/2)_4$ is $+1$ or $-1$ according as $p$ is congruent to $1$ or $9$ modulo $16$. In the case $(p/q) = -1$, the Hilbert $2$-class field coincides with the genus field $K^* = Q(\sqrt{p},\sqrt{q}\,)$. This is also the Hilbert $2$-class field in the usual sense if $(p/q) = +1$ and $(p/q)_4 (q/p)_4 = -1$; in this case, however, there is a quadratic extension of the genus field unramified at finite primes, which can be constructed explicitly by solving the diophantine equation $x^2 - 4py^2 = q$ and setting $K = K^*(\sqrt{\mu})$ for $\mu = x + 2y\sqrt{p}$, where the sign of $x$ is chosen in such a way that $\mu$ is congruent to a square mod $4$, i.e., such that $x + 2y \equiv 1 \bmod 4$. In this case this means that $x$ is negative. For the smallest discriminants, the corresponding elements are 

Generate a sequence of $B$s and $R$s using Polya's urn as you describe, starting from $b$ blue and $r$ red balls; First randomly draw $p$ from a Beta$(b,r)$ distribution. Now, given $p$, generate an i.i.d. sequence of $B$s and $R$s in which each entry is an $B$ with probability $p$ and a $R$ with probability $1-p$. 

It converges to a strictly positive limit. Perhaps easiest to think about it in this way; assign every vertex an independent time which is uniform on $[0,1]$. If the vertices of $G_n$ are added in increasing order of their times, then this is equivalent to adding them one by one uniformly as you describe. But this way we can easily think about all the vertices in the infinite graph simultaneously. Now condition on the time of the root. Given that this time is $p$, the set of vertices preceding the root contains each other vertex independently with probability $p$. Call this the set of open vertices. Effectively this is percolation with a random probability $p$ (itself chosen uniformly on $[0,1]$). If we do percolation with probability $p$, then there exists an infinite open path starting from the root with positive probability iff $p>1/3$. This is almost the same as the probability of survival of a Galton-Watson branching process whose offspring distribution is Binomial($3,p$); the difference is that here the root has $4$ possible offspring, while each other vertex has only $3$. The probability (as a fuction of $p$) can be quite easily obtained as the solution of a recursive equation. To get the probability that the set of open vertices contains an infinite path from the root, integrate over $p$ from $1/3$ to $1$. The limit as $n\to\infty$ of the probability that the set of open vertices contains a path from the root to distance $n$ is then just this probability that the set of open vertices contains an infinite path from the root.
